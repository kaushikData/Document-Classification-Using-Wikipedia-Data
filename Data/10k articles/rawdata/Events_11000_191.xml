The '''1994 [[Brickyard 400]]''' was held on Saturday, August 6, 1994, at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]. The race marked the nineteenth race of the [[1994 NASCAR Winston Cup Series]] season. It was the first [[NASCAR]] [[Stock car racing|stock car]] race at the famous Speedway, and the first race of any kind held at the track besides the [[Indianapolis 500]] since the [[Harvest Auto Racing Classic|Harvest Classic]] in 1916. The race featured the largest crowd in NASCAR history, and a then NASCAR record purse of $3.2 million.

Second-year driver, 23-year-old [[Jeff Gordon]] from nearby [[Pittsboro, Indiana|Pittsboro]], was cheered on by the hometown crowd to a popular win.&lt;ref name="CMT 40 Greatest"&gt;{{cite news| url =http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/greatest_series/88233/episode_featured_copy.jhtml

The race was a culmination of over two years of preparation, and decades of speculation. While the event was looked on with enormous anticipation and significant media attention, the [[Indianapolis 500 traditions|traditional nature]] of the Indianapolis 500 and the Speedway was a concern to ownership, some from the [[American open-wheel car racing|Indy car]] community, and some fans.&lt;ref name="Star06-28-1992pg58"&gt;{{cite news|title=NASCAR race irks Indy pilots (Part 1)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21185538/|first=Robin|last=Miller|author-link=Robin Miller (journalist)|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=59|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=June 28, 1992|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star06-28-1992pg65"&gt;{{cite news|title=NASCAR race irks Indy pilots (Part 2)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/21185580/|first=Robin|last=Miller|author-link=Robin Miller (journalist)|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=65|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=June 28, 1992|accessdate=June 22, 2018}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite some mild complaints, the event was considered a huge success and a financial [[cash cow]]—it ultimately bankrolled the formation of the [[INDYCAR|Indy Racing League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibj.com/nascar-decline-not-good-for-openwheel-racing/PARAMS/article/21414|title=Brickyard decline not good for IRL|publisher=Indiana Business Journal|first=Anthony|last=Schoettle|date=2010-07-31|accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The race featured two former Indy 500 winners ([[A. J. Foyt]] and [[Danny Sullivan]]). Foyt came out of retirement to participate, which would be his final [[Winston Cup]] start.&lt;ref&gt;http://racing-reference.info/driver/A.J._Foyt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

[[File:1993BrickyardtestIrvan.jpg|thumb|300px|The #28 [[Yates Racing|Robert Yates Racing]] car being unloaded from the transporter in Gasoline Alley.]]
The [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] opened in 1909, and the first [[Indianapolis 500]] was held in [[1911 Indianapolis 500|1911]]. It became a tradition that the Indianapolis 500 was the only race held at the track annually. With the exception of a [[Labor Day]] [[Harvest Auto Racing Classic|race meet]] in 1916, no other races were held at the track through 1993. As the [[NASCAR]] [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series#Winston Cup|Winston Cup Series]] began to grow in stature and popularity, speculation began to grow in the 1980s and early 1990s about the possibility of holding a race at Indy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|series=The Talk of Gasoline Alley|serieslink=Donald Davidson (historian)|station=[[WFNI]]|airdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StarStar12-07-1979"&gt;{{cite news|title=Firecracker 400 To Indianapolis?|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5716108//|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=41|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=December 7, 1979|accessdate=June 29, 2016}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star08-09-1985a"&gt;{{cite news|title=Speedway's new 96 garages will accent spaciousness (Part 1)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14338545/gasoline_alley_1985/|first=Jep|last=Cadou Jr.|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=August 9, 1985|accessdate=October 11, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star08-09-1985b"&gt;{{cite news|title=Speedway's new 96 garages will accent spaciousness (Part 2)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14338719/gasoline_alley_1985/|first=Jep|last=Cadou Jr.|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=8|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=August 9, 1985|accessdate=October 11, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 1991, [[A. J. Foyt]] filmed a commercial for [[Craftsman (tools)|Craftsman tools]] at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. While filming in the garage area, Foyt, and Speedway president [[Tony George]] decided to take Foyt's NASCAR Winston Cup Series stock car for a few laps around the track.&lt;ref name="Star09-25-1991"&gt;{{cite news|title=NASCAR at Indy?|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/8155527/aj_foyt_driving_nascar_stock_car_at/|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=23|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=September 25, 1991|accessdate=January 3, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foyt was the first driver to do so, and later on, George himself took a few laps. The event was not planned, and had no implications, but was an unusual sight, and stirred up some mild interest and speculation for the future.

In December 1991, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway board  of directors voted to pursue a second race at the Speedway, preferably a NASCAR Winston Cup event. In March 1992, [[International Race of Champions|IROC]] was invited to test cars at the Speedway. On June 22–23, 1992, nine top NASCAR Winston Cup series teams were invited to test at Indy. Although no official announcements were made, it was in fact an unofficial compatibility test to see if stock cars would be competitive at the circuit. An estimated 10,000 spectators watched two days of history in the making.

On April 14, 1993, Speedway President Tony George and president of NASCAR [[Bill France, Jr.]] jointly announced the Inaugural Brickyard 400 would be held Saturday, August 6, 1994.&lt;ref name="Star04-15-1993a"&gt;{{cite news|title=Brickyard 400 set for IMS in '94 (Part 1)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11527344/|first=Curt|last=Cavin|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=40|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=April 15, 1993|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star04-15-1993b"&gt;{{cite news|title=Brickyard 400 set for IMS in '94 (Part 2)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11527374/|first=Curt|last=Cavin|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=41|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=April 15, 1993|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new race logo was also unveiled. Immediately, anticipation for the event grew, as many drivers contemplated one-off entries, and comparisons were already being made to NASCAR's biggest event, the [[Daytona 500]]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] signed on to broadcast the race live, and [[ESPN]] would cover practice and qualifying.

===1994 season===
[[Jimmy Spencer]] won the [[Alabama 500 (Fall)|DieHard 500]] at [[Talladega Superspeedway|Talladega]], immediately proceeding the 1994 Brickyard 400. Going into the race, the top five in championship points were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://racing-reference.info/race/1994_DieHard_500/W|title=1994 DieHard 500 Results|publisher=Racing-Reference.info|accessdate=2011-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|'''Championship standings following the [[1994 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1994]] [[AMP Energy Juice 500|DieHard 500]]'''

# [[Mark Martin]], −258

}}

NASCAR's "tire war" was notable during the 1994 season. Both [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] and [[Hoosier Racing Tire|Hoosier]] tires were used by entrants. Many of the front-runners utilized Goodyear. Among the top teams using Hoosier tires was [[Geoff Bodine]].

In order to attract more entries, the initial Brickyard 400 was concurrently included in the [[K&amp;N Pro Series West|NASCAR Winston West]] schedule. One provisional starting position would be available to the top driver in Winston West points that did not qualify on speed. The points leader in Winston West standings entering the race was [[Mike Chase]].

Going into the race, conjecture amongst fans and media contemplated the possibility of an expanded field, a special qualifying format, a three-abreast starting grid, a celebrity pace car driver, or other changes for the race. However, NASCAR officials planned on treating the Brickyard 400 as any other points-paying race, with standard rules and regulations.

===1992 test===
On June 22–23, 1992, nine top NASCAR Winston Cup series teams were invited to Indy to participate in a [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tire test.&lt;ref name="Star-06-22-1992"&gt;{{cite news|title=NASCAR test set for IMS|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11527531/|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=9|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=June 22, 1992|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star-06-23-1992a"&gt;{{cite news|title=NASCAR drivers pass first Speedway test (Part 1)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11527651/|first=Robin|last=Miller|author-link=Robin Miller (journalist)|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=31|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=June 23, 1992|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Star-06-23-1992b"&gt;{{cite news|title=NASCAR drivers pass first Speedway test (Part 2)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11527663/|first=Robin|last=Miller|author-link=Robin Miller (journalist)|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=35|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=June 23, 1992|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the weekend, the teams had raced in the [[LifeLock 400 (Michigan)|Miller Genuine Draft 400]] at [[Michigan International Speedway]]. Although no official announcements were made, it was in fact an unofficial feasibility test to see if stock cars would be competitive at the circuit. An estimated 20,000-25,000 spectators watched a rather exciting two days of history in the making. [[A. J.

===1993 open test===
On August 16–17, 1993, thirty-five NASCAR teams took part in an official open test at Indy. It was held as the teams returned from the second race at [[Michigan International Speedway|Michigan]], the [[CARFAX 400|Champion Spark Plug 400]]. The top 35 teams in NASCAR points received invitations. Hosting the test in August mimicked the weather conditions expected for the race in 1994. Several thousand spectators attended, and many announcements were made.

[[Bobby Labonte]] ({{convert|165.624|mph|kph}}) set the fastest lap on Monday, while [[Bill Elliott]] ({{convert|167.467|mph|kph}}) turned the fastest lap overall on Tuesday morning. On Monday, [[Kenny Wallace]] spun out and hit the inside wall. He was taken to Methodist Hospital for minor injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-08-17/sports/9308170250_1_indy-car-record-nascar-kenny-wallace|title=Nascar Drivers Try Indy Track|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=August 17, 1993|accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At noon on Tuesday, recently retired NASCAR legend [[Richard Petty]] took four fast laps by himself, and then donated his car to the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum|Speedway museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Petty gets in 4 laps, but it was just for PR|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12448520/|first=Curt|last=Cavin|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=45|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=August 18, 1993|accessdate=July 18, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on Tuesday, during a session of "drafting practice," a full complement of over 30 cars took to the track, to simulate race condition. [[John Andretti]] spun in turn 1, and several cars crashed. No injuries were reported, but the incident drew the ire of some of the veterans who thought some drivers were pushing too hard. ESPN covered the test, airing highlights of both days on [[SpeedWeek]].

Some of the participants compared the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to [[Ontario Motor Speedway]], which was built to closely mimic Indy's layout. Only a handful of drivers in the field had actually [[Los Angeles Times 500|driven at Ontario]] before it closed (1980), and none of them felt they held any sort of measurable experience advantage.

==Pole qualifying==
[[File:1994Brickyard400RobertPressley.jpg|thumb|The car of [[Robert Pressley]] in the garage area during practice.]]
Pole qualifying for the Inaugural Brickyard 400 was held on Thursday, August 4, 1994. A NASCAR record 85 cars entered, for 43 starting positions. [[H. B. Bailey]] drew the #1 qualifying attempt. Per the NASCAR rules in 1994, a one-lap qualifying attempt was utilized. The top 20 cars in pole qualifying were locked into the starting field. The remainder of the cars could stand on their time, or make a new attempt in second-round qualifying.

Practice was held Thursday morning. Three incidents occurred, a crash by [[Robert Pressley]], a crash by [[Tim Steele (racing driver)|Tim Steele]], and [[Dale Jarrett]] brushed the wall. Pressley and Steele would switch to back-up cars, while Jarrett's car was not seriously damaged. The practice session was followed by a heavy thunderstorm that pelted the Speedway. The rain stopped and the track dried, allowing qualifying to start nearly on time at 3 p.m.

The entire qualifying line of 70 attempts was completed without a single incident. Only two drivers experienced trouble, one was [[Ken Schrader]], who blew an engine during his attempt. [[Dale Earnhardt]] took the provisional pole with a lap of {{convert|171.726|mph|kph}}, but his tenure was short-lived. The very next car out to qualify was [[Rick Mast]]. Mast set a new stock car lap record of {{convert|172.414|mph|kph}} to secure the pole position. [[Jeff Gordon]] was one of the last cars to make an attempt, and qualified third.

[[American Championship car racing|Indy car]] and [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] regular [[Geoff Brabham]], attempting his first NASCAR race, surprised many by qualifying 18th. Former Indy 500 winners [[A. J. Foyt]] and [[Danny Sullivan]], however, did not make the top twenty. [[Wally Dallenbach, Jr.]], driving for [[Petty Enterprises]], who picked 84th out of the 85 cars in line, pulled in when he felt something was wrong with the engine and ended the day with no speed.

==Second round qualifying==
[[File:1994Brickyard400BradTeague.jpg|thumb|The car of [[Brad Teague]] in the garage area during practice.]]
Second-round qualifying was held Friday, August 5, 1994. The drivers who had failed to qualify by being inside the top 20 from the previous round were allowed to stand on their time from Thursday, or erase it and make a new attempt. Due to the expected length of the session, and the sensitive nature of how the track is known to react to changing weather conditions,&lt;ref name="Star07-24-1994a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Star07-24-1994b"/&gt; for fairness, the qualifying draw order from the previous round was inverted for round two. NASCAR subsequently adopted this policy for all races from that day forth until two-round qualifying was abolished at the end of the 2000 season.

Five drivers stood on their times from Thursday, and all five hung on to qualify for the race. [[Terry Labonte]], who had placed 26th Thursday, was among those who elected to re-qualify, and he wound up the fastest qualifier of the day. The decision was wise as Labonte's Thursday speed would not have help up Friday. [[A. J. Foyt]] managed to qualify in 40th, the last car to make the field on speed. After a miserable run on Thursday, [[Kyle Petty]] found much-needed speed and placed 36th. [[Lake Speed]] (168.429&amp;nbsp;mph) and [[Harry Gant]] (168.003&amp;nbsp;mph) both failed to crack the top 40, but made the field as the provisional starters&amp;nbsp;– the two highest placed entries in NASCAR points standing not already in the race.&lt;ref name="Siano"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/06/sports/auto-racing-nascar-beats-the-heavy-brickyard-traffic.html|title=Nascar Beats the Heavy Brickyard Traffic|last=Siano|first=Joseph|date=August 5, 1994|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 22, 2017|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; No [[NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series West|Winston West Series]] competitors made the field on speed, but [[Mike Chase]] (166.312&amp;nbsp;mph) was awarded a special provisional for the highest entry in Winston West points standings (Chase was the Winston West points leader going into the race).

Very few of the one-off entries by Indy car regulars made the field. [[Danny Sullivan]] surprised himself by placing 26th for his first (and only) career Winston Cup start.&lt;ref name="Star08-06-1994-33"&gt;{{cite news|title=Surprised Sullivan 'slips' into race|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/12644836/|first=Scott|last=Horner|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|page=33|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=August 6, 1994|accessdate=July 26, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular Indy car owner [[Dick Simon]] who was noted for never failing to qualify one of his rookie drivers at the Indy 500 fell short as his driver, NASCAR veteran [[Jim Sauter]], ranked only 47th. After no major incidents on Thursday, Friday's qualifying saw wrecks or spins by four cars, including Daytona 500 polesitter [[Loy Allen Jr.]].

Among the drivers who chose not to make an qualifying attempt in the second round session was Ben Hess, who had been injured in an accident during a practice session earlier in the day.&lt;ref name="Siano"/&gt; [[H. B. Bailey]], who had drawn the first spot in the qualifying order Thursday was, per the inverted order, the final car to make a qualifying attempt on Friday. Bailey closed out time trials, gaining over 8&amp;nbsp;mph from his previous speed, but still fell far short of making the starting lineup.

===Qualifying notes===
A trio of brothers - [[Geoff Bodine|Geoff]], [[Brett Bodine|Brett]], and [[Todd Bodine]] made the field, a feat that had only been accomplished once in the history of the Indy 500. In [[1982 Indianapolis 500|1982]], [[Don Whittington|Don]], [[Bill Whittington|Bill]], and [[Dale Whittington]] all qualified for the 500. Another trio of brothers nearly did the same as [[Rusty Wallace|Rusty]] and [[Kenny Wallace]] qualified, but [[Mike Wallace]] ranked only 55th. [[P. J. Jones]], son of [[1963 Indianapolis 500]] winner [[Parnelli Jones]], and the only driver entered who was a son of a former Indy 500 winner, did not complete a qualifying attempt.

==Race summary==
===Pre-race===
[[File:1994Brickyard400Prerace.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Pre-race ceremonies]]
Popular Indianapolis 500 fixture [[Jim Nabors]] was invited to sing the national anthem, accompanied by the [[Indiana State University Marching Sycamores]]. [[Mary Fendrich Hulman|Mary F. Hulman]] gave the traditional starting command. [[Elmo Langley]] drove the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo#Fifth Generation|Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] pace car, and Doyle Ford served as flagman. The [[Flypast|flyover]] was performed by the [[181st Intelligence Wing|181st Fighter Group]], featuring four [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 fighter jets]].

All living former NASCAR [[List of Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series champions|Winston Cup Champions]] were invited to participate in a pre-race parade around the track. Besides the former champions who qualified for the race (Earnhardt, Wallace, Elliott, Waltrip, and Labonte), those in attendance included [[Richard Petty]], [[Rex White]], [[Buck Baker]], [[Ned Jarrett]], and [[Benny Parsons]]. Former [[Daytona 500]] winner [[Buddy Baker]] was also in attendance.

After the final practice session Friday evening, polesitter [[Rick Mast]], as well as [[Ernie Irvan]] and [[Brett Bodine]], were among the teams that changed the engines in their cars.&lt;ref name="Radio"/&gt;

===Start===
At the start, polesitter [[Rick Mast]] led [[Dale Earnhardt]] into turn one. In turn four, Earnhardt brushed the wall, which allowed Mast to lead the first lap. Earnhardt quickly began to slip in the standings. Meanwhile, [[Jeff Gordon]] passed Mast to take over the lead. On lap 3, [[Danny Sullivan]] lost a side window, bringing out the caution for debris. Earnhardt pitted to check the damage, and fell to the rear of the field.

The green came back out on lap 6. On lap 10, [[Jimmy Spencer]] lost control and crashed hard in turn 3. He would become the first driver to drop out.

===First half===
[[File:1994Brickyard400Restart.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Jeff Gordon]] leads the field for a restart.]]
The first half settled into a comfortable pace, with [[Jeff Gordon]] leading for several segments. The top five was battled among drivers including Gordon, [[Geoff Bodine]], [[Bill Elliott]], [[Darrell Waltrip]] and [[Brett Bodine]]. [[Dale Earnhardt]] attempted to charge through the field, and managed to lead laps during a sequence of green flag pit stops.

[[A. J. Foyt]] ran out of fuel around lap 40. He attempted to stay out and lead a lap during green flag pit stops, but had to coast around a full lap, and lost several laps in the process. He made it back to the pits, and re-joined the race.

===Second half===

On lap 95, [[Mike Chase]] and [[Dave Marcis]] crashed in turn 2, bringing out the caution. Under the yellow, [[Brett Bodine]] took on only two tires, which allowed him to re-enter the track with the lead.&lt;ref name="Martin 07-14-11"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allstate400atthebrickyard.com/brickyard400/news/show/44054-bodine-happy-to-still-drive-out-front-in-brickyard-400/

Brett got the jump and led down the backstretch on lap 100. In turn three, Geoff nudged Brett's rear bumper, which caused Brett to become [[oversteer|loose]], and Geoff took the lead.&lt;ref name="Martin 07-14-11"/&gt; In turn 4, however, Brett bumped Geoff in the rear bumper, and spun him out in front of the entire field.&lt;ref name="Martin 07-14-11"/&gt; Geoff hit the outside wall, and collected [[Dale Jarrett]]. After the crash, Geoff suggested Brett spun him out on purpose, attributing the move to "family problems" between the brothers.&lt;ref name="Martin 07-14-11"/&gt; Brett later admitted he spun Geoff out on purpose, and the brothers feuded for nearly two years afterward.&lt;ref name="Martin 07-14-11"/&gt;

With [[Geoff Bodine]] out, the race came down to a battle between [[Jeff Gordon]] and [[Ernie Irvan]], with [[Brett Bodine]] holding on to a strong top five position.

On lap 130, [[Geoff Brabham]] got high in turn 1 and hit the outside wall. [[Jimmy Hensley]] swerved to avoid him, but Brabham spun and smacked into the side of Hensley's car. Brabham was out of the race, but Hensley limped back to the pits with damaged fenders and flat tires. During the caution the leaders made their final scheduled pit stops. [[Rusty Wallace]]'s pit crew led by Buddy Parrott, executed a 15.9 second pit stop, and he came out of the pits with the lead. [[Jeff Gordon]] and [[Ernie Irvan]] came out second and third. The top five was rounded out by [[Brett Bodine]] and [[Bill Elliott]]. By that point in the race, [[Dale Earnhardt]] had worked all the way up to seventh.

The green flag came back out on with 26 laps to. [[Rusty Wallace]] held the lead into turn 1, but [[Jeff Gordon]] passed him going down the backstretch. The two ran side-by-side in turn four, down the main stretch, and into turn 1. Gordon finally got by, Irvan now in second, and Wallace slipped all the way back to 7th.

===Finish===
[[File:1994Brickyard400IrvanBrabham.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ernie Irvan]] (#28) leading [[Geoff Brabham]] (#07).]]
With 20 laps to go, [[Ernie Irvan]] led [[Jeff Gordon]] and [[Brett Bodine]]. Gordon was battling a loose condition, and decided to tuck in behind Irvan to improve his handling. As the laps dwindled down, Irvan and Gordon raced nose-to-tail, and began to pull away from the rest of the field. Gordon slipped by to re-take the lead on lap 145. Irvan stayed within reach, and on lap 149, attempted to pass Gordon for the lead on the backstretch. Gordon stayed high in turn three, and the two went side-by-side into the turn. Exiting turn 4, Gordon held off the challenge. On lap 150, exiting turn two, Irvan tried the same move, and this time took the lead.

With ten laps to go, Gordon tucked into second, and allowed Irvan to lead. Gordon's crew was instructing him to wait until the final 2–3 laps to make a pass attempt for the lead.

With five laps to go, Irvan apparently ran over a piece of debris down the main stretch. He slid high going into turn one, and Jeff Gordon immediately dove underneath to take the lead. Down the backstretch, Irvan's right front tire blew, and he was forced to the pits. Gordon pulled away with [[Brett Bodine]] now in second. In the final four laps, Bodine began to close the gap, but Gordon held off the challenge and won the Inaugural Brickyard 400, his second career NASCAR Winston Cup victory. ABC Sports announcers Bob Jenkins and Benny Parsons described the finish thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Jenkins''': Years from today when 79 ''(the number of Indianapolis 500s run prior to this event)'' stock car races have been run here, we'll remember the name: Jeff Gordon, winner of the inaugural Brickyard 400!&lt;br&gt;'''Parsons''': Man, oh man, oh MAN!&lt;br&gt;'''Jenkins''': Jeff is screaming on his radio back to the pit crew, "Oh my God, I did it! I did it!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After dropping to last place early on, [[Dale Earnhardt]] charged all the way to a fifth-place finish. A dejected [[Ernie Irvan]] wound up a lap down in 17th place. Two weeks later, Irvan was involved in a [[Ernie Irvan#Head injury|serious crash]] at [[Michigan International Speedway]] where he suffered a near-fatal head injury. [[Brett Bodine]]'s second place with [[King Racing]] would be the final top five finish of his career. It was also the best finish for car owner [[Kenny Bernstein]] at the Speedway. Bodine's second place came six days after [[Scott Goodyear]] had delivered King Racing their first Indy car victory at [[Firestone Indy 400|Michigan]].

==Broadcasting==
The 1994 Brickyard 400 was carried live on television by [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]]. [[Paul Page]], who was the announcer on ABC's Indianapolis 500 broadcasts, served as host, with ABC/ESPN's regular NASCAR announcer [[Bob Jenkins]] handling the play-by-play duties. His fellow commentator on ESPN NASCAR broadcasts, [[Benny Parsons]], served as color commentator. The pit reporters included [[Gary Gerould]], [[Jerry Punch]], and [[Jack Arute]].&lt;ref name="TV"&gt;1994 Brickyard 400 Television Broadcast: ABC Sports - August 6, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[ESPN]] carried practice and qualifying with the same crew. [[Ned Jarrett]] joined the booth crew for practice/qualifying only, but did not work in the television booth on race day (he had a contract at the time with CBS).

The race was carried live on the radio by the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network|IMS Radio Network]]. The broadcast was carried by over 450 affiliates in the United States. [[Mike Joy]] served as the play-by-play, with [[Ned Jarrett]] as analyst.&lt;ref name="Radio"&gt;1994 Brickyard 400 Radio Broadcast: IMS Radio Network archives - August 6, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The turn reporters&lt;ref name="Radio"/&gt; were [[Jerry Baker (announcer)|Jerry Baker]], Gary Lee, Larry Henry, and [[Bob Lamey]]. The pit reporters&lt;ref name="Radio"/&gt; were [[Glenn Jarrett]], [[Dave Despain]], John Kernan and Chris McClure. Howdy Bell served as statistician. [[Chris Economaki]] sat in as a booth analyst during the pre-race, then as a roving reporter conducting interviews, and covering the garage area and hospital during the race. [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] historian [[Donald Davidson (historian)|Donald Davidson]] and author Greg Fielden were guests in the pre-race coverage, offering historical commentary.&lt;ref name="Radio"/&gt; During the race itself, Davidson worked as a spotter for Bob Lamey on the radio. Davidson reprised his popular program ''[[Donald Davidson (historian)#The Talk of Gasoline Alley|The Talk of Gasoline Alley]]'' on WIBC for the week leading up to the event. [[Buddy Baker]] served as the driver analyst during qualifying coverage on Thursday and Friday (as Jarrett had commitments with ESPN). On race day, Baker was not part of the crew but visited the booth for a brief interview. 

The Speedway public address announcing team from the Indy 500 was retained for the Brickyard 400. The chief announcer [[Tom Carnegie]] was joined by Jim Phillippe and David Calabro, but John Totten did not participate.

The '''2004 United Nations Climate Change Conference''' took place between December 6 and December 17, 2004 in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. The conference included the 10th Conference of the Parties (COP10) to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC).

The parties discussed the progress made since the first [[United Nations Climate Change Conference]] ten years ago and its future challenges, with special emphasis on [[climate change mitigation]] and adaptation. To promote [[developing countries]] better adapt to [[climate change]], the Buenos Aires Plan of Action&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/cop4/resource/docs/cop4/16a01.pdf UNFCCC.int]&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted. The parties also began discussing the post-Kyoto mechanism, on how to allocate emission reduction obligation following 2012, when the first commitment period ends.

The '''2009 Richmond High School gang rape''' occurred on Saturday, October 24, 2009, in [[Richmond, California|Richmond]], a city on the northeast side of the [[San Francisco Bay]] in [[California]], U.S., when a female student of [[Richmond High School (Richmond, California)|Richmond High School]] was [[gang rape]]d repeatedly by a group of young males in a courtyard on the school campus while a [[homecoming dance]] was being held in the gymnasium. Although seven people faced charges related to the rape, one was released after a [[preliminary hearing]]. Five of the remaining six faced life imprisonment, should the charges be upheld, and one faced a maximum of eight years in jail. All initially pleaded not guilty.

The incident received national attention.&lt;ref name='sfgate1101' /&gt;&lt;ref name='kgo1028'&gt;{{cite news | first=Cecilia | last=Vega | title=5 arrested in rape of girl in Richmond | date=October 28, 2009 | url =http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local/east_bay&amp;id=7086765 | publisher= [[KGO-TV|KGO]] | pages = | accessdate = October 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 20 witnesses are believed to have been aware of the attack, but for more than two hours no one notified the police.&lt;ref name="CNN Chen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chen |first=Stephanie|publisher=[[CNN]]|title=Gang rape raises questions about bystanders' role|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/10/28/california.gang.rape.bystander/index.html|date=October 30, 2009|accessdate = October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trials for the six defendants began September 2012, with defendant Manuel Ortega pleading guilty to four [[Felony|felonies]] and sentenced the following month to 32 years in prison. Ari Morales was sentenced to 27 years in prison.

==Details==
On October 24, 2009 at about 9:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. ([[UTC-7]]), at the conclusion of the homecoming dance, a classmate invited the victim to join a group of males ranging in ages from 15 to late 40s, who were [[Alcohol consumption by youth in the United States|drinking alcohol]] in a dark courtyard on campus. The female victim drank an undetermined amount of [[brandy]] by choice, and was propositioned for sex by the alleged attackers. When the victim refused, she was placed on a nearby concrete bench and continuously beaten and raped for 2½ hours, at times with a 'foreign object'. They also poured alcohol down her throat. Test results showed she had an almost fatal blood alcohol level.&lt;ref name='sj11012'&gt;{{cite news | first=Karl | last=Fischer |author2=Todd Perlman | title= No parents at Richmond dance where girl raped | date=November 1, 2009 | publisher= | url =

The victim was found unconscious under a picnic table and was [[air ambulance|air-lifted]] to a hospital in [[critical condition]].&lt;ref name='kcra'&gt;{{cite news | title= Police: Girl Raped At Richmond High | date=October 26, 2009 | url =http://www.kcra.com/news/21428503/detail.html | publisher =[[KCRA]] | pages = | accessdate = October 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was released from the hospital on Wednesday, October 28.

A bystander described the assault:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They were kicking her in her head and they were beating her up, robbing her and ripping her clothes off; it's something you can't get out your mind. I saw people, like, dehumanizing her; I saw some pretty crazy stuff. She was pretty quiet; I thought she was like dead for a minute but then I saw her moving around.

Four of the suspects were arraigned on October 29 in the [[Contra Costa County Superior Court]] in [[Martinez, California|Martinez]].

==Response==
The attack shocked the community and the nation. Local media said that the act "crossed the boundary of civilized behavior".

The attack became the most popular [[blog]] topic of the week of October 26–30, as bloggers expressed their outrage over the rape. During that week, more than a quarter (26%) of the links from blogs to news sites were to articles about the attack.&lt;ref name='blog_outrage'&gt;{{cite news | title=Bloggers Express Outrage Over Assault | date = November 5, 2009 | publisher=PewResearchCenter Publications |url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1402/bloggers-express-outrage-over-assault |accessdate = November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A website was created in order to support the victim and discuss ways to prevent sexual assault on women.&lt;ref name='sfgate1125'&gt;{{cite news | first=Kevin | last=Fagan |title= Thousands worldwide voice support for raped girl | date=November 25, 2009 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/11/25/MN0R1ANJ5E.DTL&amp;tsp=1 | newspaper =San Francisco Chronicle| accessdate = November 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the attack, local toughs talked of [[vigilante justice]] against the attackers and onlookers.&lt;ref name=sfgate_violence&gt;{{cite news | first=Kevin | last=Fagan |author2=Lee, Henry K.|title= Violence always the wrong choice| date=November 4, 2009 | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/11/03/BAV11AEG4H.DTL |accessdate = November 5, 2009|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victim's parents made their first public statement on November 1:&lt;blockquote&gt;Please do not respond to this tragic event by promoting hatred or by causing more pain. We have had enough violence already in this place. If you need to express your outrage, please channel your anger into positive action. Volunteer at a school. Go help a neighbor.

Over 500 students, parents, and area residents held a candle-lit vigil on November 3.

In response to the events, [[California State Senator]] [[Leland Yee]] suggested legislation to broaden the criteria when failure to report a crime constitutes a criminal offense. Under Yee's proposal, bystanders to crimes against minors could be charged with a [[misdemeanor]] criminal offense for failure to immediately report the incident to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Lawmaker Supports Tougher Crime Reporting Law|first= John | last=Lobertini|url=http://www.fox40.com/news/headlines/ktxl-news-bystander-law,0,2270009.story|publisher= [[KTXL]]|date=November 8, 2009 |accessdate=November 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the hearing, one of the defendants was released.

==Trial==
Jury selection for trials of the defendants began September 4, 2012.

Manuel Ortega, who was an adult at the time of the crime and the most heavily charged of the six defendants, pleaded guilty to all charges against him on September 6 and was sentenced on October 19, accepting a 32-year sentence and avoiding possible life in prison.&lt;ref name=Fraley&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/news/ci_21483962/defendant-pleads-guilty-richmond-high-school-gang-rape |title=Defendant pleads guilty in Richmond High School gang rape case |author=Fraley, Malaika |date=September 7, 2012 |newspaper=[[Contra Costa Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richmondconfidential.org/2012/10/19/ortega-sentenced-for-32-years-in-richmond-high-rape-case/ |title=Ortega sentenced for 32 years in Richmond High rape case |last1=Brown |first1=Julie |last2=Baires |first2=Jennifer |date=October 19, 2012 |work=Richmond Confidential |publisher= |accessdate=October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted of rape in concert, rape by a foreign object in concert, forced oral copulation in concert resulting in great bodily injury, and robbery.&lt;ref name=Fraley/&gt; Ortega was described by authorities as an initiator in the rape, with witnesses alleging he ripped off the girl's clothes, punched and kicked her in the head, sexually assaulted her and encouraged others to do the same.&lt;ref name=Fraley/&gt;

In June 2013, in the trials of Jose Montano, 22 and Marcelles Peter, 20, the victim testified in court for the first time. She stated she had never consumed alcohol previously, and that she did not drink from a bottle of brandy the men had with them. Salvardor Rodriguez, previously sentenced, testified "Before she even said hello, she grabbed a bottle (of brandy) and started chugging it." The prosecutor said in his opening statement that head trauma and her 0.35 blood alcohol level interfered with her memory of the events, saying, "They were pouring booze in her and on her, and that's after she was drinking it on her own." Charges were dismissed against the then-15-year-old classmate who invited her to the courtyard. Two more men were scheduled to be tried in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_23477950/richmond-high-gang-rape-victim-takes-stand?source=JBarTicker|author=Fraley, Malaika|title=Richmond High gang rape victim takes the stand|newspaper=Contra Costa Times|date=17 June 2013|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monetary settlement==
In January 2011 the victim received a monetary settlement from the school district of $4 million. She received an immediate payout of $2.5 million, with the remaining $1.5 million to be paid over the next 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/local/east_bay&amp;id=7912910|title=Richmond High School gang rape victim gets $4M settlement|newspaper=ABC News|date= 21 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AIG Lobby at 70 Pine Street.jpg|thumb|The lobby of AIG's headquarters in the [[American International Building]].]]
The '''AIG bonus payments controversy''' began in March 2009, when it was publicly disclosed that the [[American International Group]] (AIG) insurance corporation was going to pay approximately $218 million in bonus payments to employees of its financial services division.

AIG is notable for having received taxpayer bailouts and in the fourth quarter of 2008 posted a loss of $61.7 billion, the greatest ever for any corporation.&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iNRov4y45sOcxD19w5vzO3FJIixwD96V7QSG3 |accessdate=March 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320090920/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iNRov4y45sOcxD19w5vzO3FJIixwD96V7QSG3 |archivedate=March 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the $165 million in bonus payments that were announced, total bonuses for the financial unit could reach $450 million and bonuses for the entire company could reach $1.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Elizabeth |last=MacDonald |url=http://emac.blogs.foxbusiness.com/2009/03/17/american-inconscionable-group/ |title=American Inconscionable Group |publisher=blogs.foxbusiness.com |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=October 31, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922152721/http://emac.blogs.foxbusiness.com/2009/03/17/american-inconscionable-group/ |archivedate=September 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses from politicians==

President [[Barack Obama]] said, "[I]t’s hard to understand how derivative traders at AIG warranted any bonuses, much less $165 million in extra pay. How do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat?" and "In the last six months, AIG has received substantial sums from the U.S. Treasury. I’ve asked [[Timothy Geithner|Secretary Geithner]] to use that leverage and pursue every legal avenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayers whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/obamas-statement-on-aig/ | work=The New York Times | title=Obama's Statement on A.I.G | date=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/us/politics/17obama.html?fta=y Obama Orders Treasury Chief to Try to Block A.I.G.

Representative [[Barney Frank]] said "I do want to stress, this initial intervention into AIG was not part of the congressional rescue plan.", "Before we were even asked by the Bush administration to do the rescue plan, President Bush‘s two top economic appointees Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson came to us and said--Mr. Bernanke, as head of the Federal Reserve is going to lend $85 billion to AIG under a statute that dates back to 1932. They didn't ask us. They didn't solicit our opinion. They simply informed us.", and "Since then, when we have voted, we have put tough conditions on. And, in fact, this won't be happening again.

===Tax on bonuses===

On March 19, 2009, the House of Representatives approved, by a vote of 328 to 93, a measure to levy a 90% tax on bonuses awarded by corporations receiving more than $5 billion in Treasury aid from the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/business/20bailout.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;hp | work=The New York Times | title=House Approves 90% Tax on Bonuses After Bailouts | first1=Carl | last1=Hulse | first2=David M. | last2=Herszenhorn | date=March 20, 2009 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House bill affects individuals who make $250,000 or more in total household income and bonuses paid or scheduled to be paid after December 31, 2008.
The Senate version of the bill is similar to the House bill except it will levy a 70% tax on bonuses awarded by corporations that are receiving any amount of Treasury aid from the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP). The 70% tax will be paid through a 35% excise tax on the corporation and 35% tax on the receiver of the bonus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/03/19/house-vote-taxing-aig-bonus-bonanza/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323034625/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/03/19/house-vote-taxing-aig-bonus-bonanza/ |date=March 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikinews|US president Obama, Congress call for blocking of executive bonuses at AIG insurance company}} Some commentators suggested that such a tax would run into constitutional problems, because Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution prohibits Congress from enacting [[bill of attainder]] and [[ex post facto]] laws. However, [[Laurence Tribe]], quoted in the blog of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', said that there were no insoluble constitutional difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2009/03/18/would-an-aig-bonus-tax-pass-constitutional-muster-a-tribe-calls-yes/ Would an AIG-Bonus Tax Pass Constitutional Muster?], Wall St. Journal, March 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted experts on constitutional and tax law having said it was likely the House bill could pass muster. Numerous court rulings have upheld retroactive tax provisions, particularly over short periods (The House bill applies back only to January 1, 2009). The measure is also strengthened by the fact that it does not apply to just one company or group of individuals, and does not take aim only at past bonuses paid in 2009 but also bonuses to be paid in future.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/business/20bailout.html House Passes Heavy Tax on Bonuses at Rescued Firms], The New York Times, March 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 22, 2009 Wall St. Journal editorial, Jonathan Clements, a Citi employee, wrote, "... by mid-October, I will hit $250,000 in total income -- and have no incentive to earn any more income in 2009. At that point, I plan to ask Citi for an unpaid sabbatical." He also notes that some individuals have already received and spent most of their bonuses and will not be able to afford the tax.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123776600113009243 The Bonus Tax Is Just Plain Stupid: Come October I'll have no incentive to work anymore], Wall St. Journal, March 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restriction on base compensation===

Congressman [[Brad Sherman]] introduced a bill to restrict base salaries of employees of firms who have taken $5 billion or more in the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] by taxing all non-bonus compensation over $500,000. It is designed to tax all compensations, including all payments that may be "re-named" bonuses to ensure that individuals and firms will not escape the bonus tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/list/press/ca27_sherman/morenews/31909MillionDollarBonusBaby.html |title=Congressman Brad Sherman (CA27) :: Press Release :: Million-Dollar-A-Month Salaries Go Unscathed |publisher=House.gov |date=March 19, 2009 |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/stories/2009/03/20/08_aig_votes_031909.html |accessdate=March 24, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political commentators and journalists have expressed an equally bipartisan outrage. Commentator [[Charles Krauthammer]] said "I would deny them the bonuses if possible.

In an online editorial for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', [[James Taranto]] speculated that for bonus recipients living in [[New York City]], if the 90% bonus tax passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]] is added to the [[Medicare (United States)#Taxes imposed to finance Medicare|Medicare FICA]] tax of 1.45%, plus the state and local taxes of 6.85% and 3.648%, respectively, it adds up to a tax rate of 101.948%.

Rick Newman of [[US News &amp; World Report]] argues that this is tantamount to [[extortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rick |last=Newman |url=https://www.usnews.com/blogs/flowchart/2009/03/17/whats-good-whats-bad-about-the-aig-bailout.html |title=What’s Good, What’s Bad About the AIG Bailout |publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSNBC host [[David Shuster]] said "The argument that these were so-called retention bonuses is undermined by the fact that 52 of the people who received them have already left the company."&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com" /&gt;

To date, few people outside of AIG itself have defended AIG's payments of the bonuses. Former [[White House Press Secretary]] under the [[George W. Bush]] administration [[Dana Perino]] defended AIG, saying "If they don't get it [the bonus], maybe they won't be motivated enough to try to help the company turn around." and accusing the "rhetoric in Washington" of "demonizing people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Armbruster |first=Ben |url=http://thinkprogress.org/2009/03/17/perino-defends-aig/ |title=Perino Defends AIG Bonuses: They Are 'Middle Class People' Who 'Are Expecting To Get This Bonus' |publisher=ThinkProgress |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terence Corcoran]], writing in the ''[[Financial Post]]'', claims that AIG is innocent, and instead "massive government failure" on the part of [[Barack Obama]], whom Corcoran claims "doesn't get it," is at fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/business/fp/story.html?id=1396161 |accessdate=March 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320081452/http://www.canada.com/business/fp/story.html?id=1396161 |archivedate=March 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evan Newmark of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' accused those attacking AIG of "hysterical, bloodthirsty ravings" and "populist hurly-burly."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2009/03/18/mean-street-aig-the-revolution-will-devour-congress/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Mean Street: AIG&amp;ndash;The Revolution Will Devour Congress | date=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Andrew Ross Sorkin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' argued the case for paying bonuses, saying there was likely some truth to AIG's claim that it needed to retain its top talent, and that its most talented employees could find employment elsewhere. Sorkin also said not paying the bonuses could spark problems across the business community. "If you think this economy is a mess now, imagine what it would look like if the business community started to worry that the government would start abrogating contracts left and right," wrote Sorkin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/business/17sorkin.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Case for Paying Out Bonuses at A.I.G | date=March 17, 2009 | accessdate=April 23, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090416004314/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/business/17sorkin.html| archivedate=April 16, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joshua Zumbrun of ''[[Forbes]]'' and Eliot Spitzer of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' argued that the outrage over bonuses distracted from a larger issue: that AIG had taken much of the bailout money and used it to settle contracts with its counterparties, Wall Street banks, hedge funds and non-U.S. banks, at full price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zumbrun |first=Joshua |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/03/16/bailout-bonus-aig-business-washington-aig.html |title=AIG's Bonus Distraction |publisher=Forbes |date=March 16, 2009 |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spitzer |first=Eliot |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2213942/ |title=The Real AIG Scandal |publisher=Slate |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative political commentator [[Rush Limbaugh]] defended AIG, saying "We've got [[proletariat|peasants]] with their pitchforks phoning in death threats at AIG. We have members of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives sounding like communist dictators." Limbaugh's comments defended that the bonuses were legal and productive, saying "This money went to American citizens. This money went mostly to American citizens who are registered Democrats. These people who got the bonus are going to spend it. That's called private sector stimulus...The ones who got the bonuses did so on the basis of sales success. These were reported as merit bonuses that they are contractually permitted to get. If you violate their contract, if you don't give them their bonus, you have got a lawsuit on your hands and 80% of this company is now owned by [[Barney Frank]] and [[Chris Dodd]] and [[Nancy Pelosi|[Nancy] Pelosi]], and so they would be sued, the government would be sued by these people." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_031609/content/01125106.guest.html |title=The Last Man Standing Speaks in Defense of AIG Bailout Bonuses - The Rush Limbaugh Show |publisher=Rushlimbaugh.com |date=March 16, 2009 |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIG CEO [[Edward M. Liddy]] told Congress that he asked employees who received bonuses over $100,000 to give half back. David Shuster said "That sounded half-assed to members of Congress who were both channeling and deflecting voter outrage."&lt;ref name="msnbc.msn.com" /&gt;

AIG has pointed out that Connecticut, the state where AIG is based, has a law called the Wage Act. According to the law, employers who don't pay employees the money which they are contractually obligated to pay, could ultimately be required to pay twice that amount.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Economy/story?id=7097759&amp;page=1 Could Be Worse: AIG Double Bonus Jeopardy: Not Paying $165M Bonuses Could Open AIG -- and Taxpayers -- to $330M Lawsuit], ABC News, March 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 23, 2009, 9 of the 10 highest paid AIG executives had agreed to give back their bonuses - and of the 20 highest paid, 15 had agreed to give back their bonuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcbstv.com/breakingnewsalerts/aig.bonuses.andrew.2.965982.html 9 Of Top 10 AIG Execs To Give Back Bonuses] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325055828/http://wcbstv.com/breakingnewsalerts/aig.bonuses.andrew.2.965982.html |date=2009-03-25 }}, WCBS TV, March 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response by state officials==

On March 16, 2009, New York State Attorney General [[Andrew Cuomo]] sent a letter to AIG demanding "the list of individuals who are to receive payments" and "a description of each individual's job description and performance at AIG Financial Products" in order to determine "whether any of the individuals receiving such payments were involved in the conduct that led to AIG's demise and subsequent bailout" and "whether, as you claim, such individuals are truly required to unwind AIG Financial Product's positions."&lt;ref&gt;Meg Marco, [http://consumerist.com/5170898/ny-attorney-general-to-aig-you-have-until-400-pm-to-give-us-the-names NY Attorney General To AIG: You Have Until 4:00 PM To Give Us The Names] ''The Consumerist'', March 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; AIG failed to respond,&lt;ref&gt;''Dealbook'', [http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/cuomo-to-subpoena-aig-for-bonus-information Cuomo to Subpoena AIG for Bonus Information] ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; so Cuomo subpoenaed them for the names of the bonus recipients.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Louise Story, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/18/business/18cuomo.html Cuomo Details Million-Dollar Bonuses at AIG] ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Cuomo announced that 73 AIG employees were each paid more than $1 million in bonuses, saying "AIG made more than 73 millionaires in the unit which lost so much money that it brought the firm to its knees, forcing a taxpayer bailout." and "Something is deeply wrong with this outcome."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;

On March 21, Connecticut Attorney General [[Richard Blumenthal]] issued a subpoena to AIG to find out why they gave out an additional $53 million in bonuses on top of the $165 million already reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29812224/ |title=Official: AIG bonus estimates grow $53 million |publisher=MSNBC |date=March 21, 2009 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bonuses exempted in TARP==

On February 14, 2009, the Wall Street Journal published an article, Bankers Face Strict New Pay Cap,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123457165806186405 Bankers Face Strict New Pay Cap] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', February 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; discussing a retroactive limit to bonus compensation ''inserted'' by Chris Dodd into the TARP bill that passed in the Senate. The same article went on to mention that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Lawrence Summers "had called Sen. Dodd and asked him to reconsider".

On March 17, 2009, Fox Business Network's Rich Edson first reported Senator Chris Dodd included a provision exempting such bonuses from the executive pay limits clause of the TARP.&lt;ref&gt;Rich Edson, [http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/finance/dodd-cracks-aig---time/ Amid AIG Furor, Dodd Tries to Undo Bonus Protections He Put In] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019062909/http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/finance/dodd-cracks-aig---time/ |date=October 19, 2011 }} ''[[Fox Business Network]]'', March 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rich Edson, [http://bluemassgroup.com/2009/03/amid-aig-furor-dodd-tries-to-undo-bonus-protections-he-put-in/ Amid AIG Furor, Dodd Tries to Undo Bonus Protections He Put In] ''[[Fox Business Network]] by way of [[Blue Mass Group]]'', March 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michelle Malkin, [http://michellemalkin.com/2009/03/17/chris-dodd-for-aig-bonuses-before-he-was-against-them/ Chris Dodd: For AIG bonuses before he was against them] ''Michellemalkin.com'', March 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; When the bill left conference, Dodd's provision had been removed and replaced with the explicit exemptions lobbied for by Geithner and Summers.

As Dodd explained in his March 18 interview on CNN,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/03/18/breaking-i-was-responsible-for-bonus-loophole-says-dodd/|title=BREAKING: I was responsible for bonus loophole, says Dodd|work=CNN.com|publisher=CNN|date=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Geithner and the Obama Administration's insistence he removed the language he had himself inserted and replaced it with Geithner and Summers' loophole, which thus allowed the bonuses which formed the basis for the AIG scandal.

On March 24, 2009, [[The New York Times]] printed the [[open letter]] of resignation of Jake DeSantis, an executive vice president of AIG’s financial products unit, to Edward M.

DeSantis stated that he and the majority of AIG-F.P. employees had nothing to do with the money-losing credit default swaps, that many of them had lost much of their savings in the form of [[deferred compensation]] invested in the capital of AIG-F.P., that he and others had agreed to work for an annual salary of $1 out of a sense of duty to the company, that AIG-F.P. employees were assured many times following the government bailout in September 2008 that AIG would honor the pre-existing retention contracts with scheduled payments to be made in March 2009, and that AIG-F.P. employees believed they were let down by Liddy's lack of support against opportunistic political pressure. He also stated he was going to donate his March 2009 payment to those suffering from the global economic downturn.&lt;ref&gt;Jake DeSantis, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/25/opinion/25desantis.html Dear AIG, I Quit!] ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apoplexy''' ({{ety|grc|ἀποπληξία|a striking away}}) is bleeding within internal [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and the accompanying symptoms. For example, [[ovarian apoplexy]] is bleeding in the ovaries. The term formerly referred to what is now called a [[stroke]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=9748 Apoplexy] at [[WebMD|MedicineNet.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; nowadays, health care professionals typically specify the type of apoplexy, such as cerebral, ovarian and [[pituitary apoplexy]].

Informally or metaphorically, the term ''apoplexy'' is associated with being furious, especially as "apoplectic".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/apoplectic Collins World English Dictionary: apoplexy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical meaning==
From the late 14th to the late 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;''OED Online'', 2010, Oxford University Press. 7 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''apoplexy'' referred to any sudden death that began with a sudden loss of consciousness, especially one in which the victim died within a matter of seconds after losing consciousness. The word ''apoplexy'' was sometimes used to refer to the symptom of sudden loss of consciousness immediately preceding death.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Ruptured [[aortic aneurysm]]s, and even [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]s and [[stroke]]s were referred to as apoplexy in the past, because before the advent of [[medical science]], there was limited ability to differentiate abnormal conditions and diseased states.  Although [[physiology]] as a medical field dates back at least to the time of [[Hippocrates]], until the late 19th century physicians often had inadequate or inaccurate understandings of many of the human body's normal functions and abnormal presentations.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}  Hence, identifying a specific cause of a symptom or of death often proved difficult or impossible.

==Haemorrhage==
Because the term by itself is now ambiguous, it is often coupled with a descriptive [[adjective]] to indicate the site of bleeding. For example, bleeding within the [[pituitary gland]] is called ''[[pituitary apoplexy]]'', and bleeding within the adrenal glands can be called ''adrenal apoplexy''.

Apoplexy also includes hemorrhaging with the gland and accompanying neurological problems such as confusion, headache, and impairment of consciousness.

[[File:Badger-baiting.jpg|thumb|Badger Baiting]]
'''Badger-baiting''' is a form of animal sport in which [[European badger|badgers]] are [[Dog-baiting|baited]] with dogs. A baiting session typically results in the death of the badger, and possibly serious injuries to the dogs.

==Background==
[[File:Badger-baiting1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|"A Match at the Badger" by [[Henry Alken]] circa 1820]]
The badger is a usually quiet and docile creature in its own domain; however, when cornered or when a threat is perceived it can possess impressive courage. Weighing up to thirty-five pounds when fully grown, the badger has an extraordinarily dangerous bite, which it is willing to use when threatened. In addition, badgers have extremely powerful claws, used for digging in hard earth, which are more than capable of injuring a dog. A formidable adversary for any dog, the badger was a sought-after victim for the fighting pit&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/03/badger-baiting-on-increase|title=Badger baiting has been outlawed since 1835 – so why is it making a comeback?|last=Barkham|first=Patrick|date=3 January 2012|website=The Guardian|access-date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Drawing the badger==
[[File:Badger-baiting2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|"Drawing the Badger" by [[Henry Alken]] circa 1820]]
In order to use the badger's ability to defend itself to test the dog, artificial badger dens were built, captured badgers were put in them and then the dog was set on the badger. The badger would be placed in a box, which was furnished in imitation of its den and from there a tunnel led upward. The owner of the badger puts his animal in the box. The [[timekeeper]] is equipped with a watch and the badger's owner releases the dog for the fight. Whoever wants to pit his dog against the badger lets it slide into the tunnel. Usually the dog is seized immediately by the badger and the dog in turn grips the badger. Each bites, tears and pulls the other with all their might. The owner of the dog quickly pulls out the dog whose jaws are clamped obstinately onto the badger by its tail. The two are separated and the badger is returned to its den. Then the dog is sent back in to seize the badger and it again is drawn out with the badger. This scene is repeated over and over again. The more often a dog is able to seize the badger within a minute, so that both can be pulled out together, the more it is up to the task and is considered game.

[[File:Badger-baiting3.jpg|thumb|right|150px|"Badger Baiting" by [[Henry Alken]] circa 1824]]
Drawing the badger came to England in the 18th century and soon became a very popular sideshow in the pit. It provided a new opportunity to win or lose money by betting. Drawing the badger thus became a permanent part of the fight in the pit. Baits were staged outside the pit in cellars or taverns, as an interesting attraction for the guests.

Towards the middle 19th century Badger-baiting declined in popularity to be replaced by [[dog fighting]], although some countryside villages kept holding such activities the Sunday after church.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Badger dogs==
Some dog breeds were specifically developed for badger-baiting whilst several other breeds were used in this task in addition to more general vermin control; breeds include the [[Dachshund]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Walker, Joan M. |title=Everything Dachshund Book: A Complete Guide To Raising, Training, And Caring For Your Dachshund |publisher=Adams Media Corporation |location=Avon, MA |year=2005 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=XWMB5aT71pAC&amp;pg=PT17 1–5]|isbn=1-59337-316-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and terriers.&lt;ref name="sundaytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article5781271.ece|author=Mooney, John|title=Exposed: The evil world of badger baiting|work=Sunday Times|date=22 February 2009|accessdate=16 June 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Animal cruelty==
Apart from the [[Animal cruelty|cruelty]] towards badgers, dogs are also brutalized in the blood sport. Dogs usually suffer injuries of the face and neck. In some cases, the injuries are such that the dogs must be [[Euthanasia|euthanized]].

Today, baiters often refrain from taking injured dogs to veterinarians as the doctor might understand what has taken place and report the owners to the police. For this reason the badger is often crippled and/or restrained to minimise the risk of injury to dogs. The badger's long front claws may be filed off; the canine teeth may be pulled out; the animal's limbs or jaw may be broken with a shovel. To inhibit the badger's movement, there are rumours that the tendons in its hind legs may be cut. Griffiths et al. mention nailing badgers to the ground by the tail.&lt;ref name="jackson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badgers.org.uk/badgerpages/eurasian-badger-11.html |author=Jackson, Steve |title=Badger baiting |accessdate=16 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016051115/http://www.badgers.org.uk/badgerpages/eurasian-badger-11.html |archivedate=16 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/scotland/Badger-baiting-is-back-warns.2353268.jp|author=Todd, Stephanie|title=Badger baiting is back warns SSPCA|work=The Scotsman|date=17 August 2002|accessdate=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The conservation and management of the European badger (Meles meles)|author=Griffiths, H.I. |author2=Thomas, D.H. |others=Council of Europe|year=1997|ISBN=92-871-3447-2|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the likelihood of these things is slim, given that badgers will attack furiously when cornered or touched. So, the chance of baiters being able to cut off claws or the like in advance of the fight, is extremely unlikely. 

When the badger can no longer fight, it is killed by the baiters using methods such as shooting, stabbing, or beating to death with a shovel. Dead badgers are sometimes dumped by the roadside to be mistaken for [[roadkill]] (a major cause of badger mortality).&lt;ref name="jackson"/&gt;

==Legal standing==
Badger baiting was outlawed in the United Kingdom as early as 1835, with the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1835|Cruelty to Animals Act]]. The practice of baiting of animals is now specifically forbidden under the [[Protection of Animals Act 1911]].&lt;ref name="law1911"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1911/cukpga_19110027_en_1 |title=Protection of Animals Act 1911 (revised) |work=OPSI website |accessdate=16 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501061749/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1911/cukpga_19110027_en_1 |archivedate=1 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the cruelty towards and death of the badger constitute offences under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992,&lt;ref name="1992act"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/51/contents|title=Protection of Badgers Act 1992|accessdate=7 October 2015|author=UK Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further offences under this act are inevitably committed to facilitate badger baiting (such as interfering with a [[sett]], or the taking or the very possession of a badger for purposes other than nursing an injured animal to health). If convicted, badger baiters may face a sentence of up to 6 months in jail, a fine of up to £5000, as well as other punitive measures, such as [[community service]] or a ban from owning dogs.&lt;ref name="law1992"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1992/ukpga_19920051_en_1 |title=Protection of Badgers Act 1992 |work=OPSI website |accessdate=16 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814144628/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1992/ukpga_19920051_en_1 |archivedate=14 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Republic of Ireland, badgers and their setts are protected under the provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976, and the Wildlife Amendment Act, 2000.

==Modern times==
Despite having been illegal for over 170 years, badger baiting has continued in a clandestine manner throughout Britain and Ireland until the present day. In February 2009, the ''[[Sunday Times]]'' reported that badger-baiting is practised by "hardcore terrier men" who are internationally organized. The ''Sunday Times'' has also reported that there is little attention on the part of the Irish government towards animal cruelty in general.&lt;ref name="sundaytimes"/&gt; The report led to a police operation in [[Ulster]] in which a number of dogs were seized, but no arrests were made.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/crackdown-appeal-after-swoops-on-badgerbaiting-ring-14199372.html|title=Crackdown appeal after swoops on badger-baiting ring|work=The Belfast Telegraph|date=23 February 2009|accessdate=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ireland the [[National Parks and Wildlife Service (Ireland)|NPWS]] has secured ten convictions for the illegal persecution of badgers in the last 20 years.&lt;ref name="sundaytimes"/&gt;

In 2009, badger baiting was believed to be on the rise according to animal welfare organizations.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/8082232.stm|title=Badger and deer crime on the rise|work=''BBC News''|date=4 June 2009|accessdate=16 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090606181050/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/8082232.stm| archivedate= 6 June 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Badger-baiting is often linked to other criminal activities, and some practitioners brag on social networks about their deeds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On 2018, David Thomas was sentenced to 22 weeks and accomplice to 20 for setting dogs on badgers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/05/huntsman-jailed-for-badger-baiting-in-wales|title=Two men jailed for badger-baiting in Wales|last=Morris|first=Steven|date=5 February 2018|website=The Guardian|access-date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crime gangs, among them Northern Irish paramilitaries, have been reported to sell badgers up to £700 to fight with dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/organised-crime-gangs-sell-badgers-baiting-dogs-betting-gambling-badger-cull-a8331736.html|title=Crime gangs selling badgers for up to £700 for baiting with dogs, fuelling high-stakes gambling|work=The Independent|access-date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''For war between the navy of Rhodes and the navy of Macedon in 201 BC, see [[Battle of Lade (201 BC)]].''

The '''Battle of Lade''' ({{lang-el|Ναυμαχία τῆς Λάδης}}, ''Naumachia tēs Ladēs'') was a [[naval battle]] which occurred during the [[Ionian Revolt]], in 494 BC. It was fought between an alliance of the [[Ionia]]n cities (joined by the [[Lesbos|Lesbians]]) and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] of [[Darius the Great]], and resulted in a decisive victory for the Persians which all but ended the revolt.

The Ionian Revolt was triggered by the dissatisfaction of the Greek cities of [[Asia Minor]] with the [[Tyranny|tyrants]] appointed by Persia to rule them. In 499 BC, the then-tyrant of [[Miletus]], [[Aristagoras]], launched a joint expedition with the Persian satrap [[Artaphernes]] to conquer [[Naxos Island|Naxos]], in an attempt to bolster his position in Miletus. The mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against the Persian king [[Darius the Great]]. Initially, in 498 BC, the Ionians went on the offensive, supported by troops from [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and [[Eretria]], capturing [[Sardis]], before suffering defeat at the [[Battle of Ephesus (498 BC)|Battle of Ephesus]]. The revolt then spread to [[Caria]] and [[Cyprus]]. Three years of Persian campaigning across Asia Minor followed, with no decisive effect. By 494 BC the Persian army and navy had regrouped, and made straight for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus.

The Ionians sought to defend Miletus by sea, leaving the defense of Miletus to the Milesians. The Ionian fleet gathered at the island of [[Miletus|Lade]], off the coast of Miletus. The Persians were uncertain of victory at Lade, so attempted to persuade some of the Ionian contingents to defect. Although this was unsuccessful at first, when the Persians finally attacked the Ionians, the [[Samos|Samian]] fleet accepted the Persian offer. As the Persian and Ionian fleets met, the Samians sailed away from the battle, causing the collapse of the Ionian battle line. Although the [[Chios|Chian]] contingent and a few other ships remained and fought bravely against the Persians, the battle was lost.

With the defeat at Lade, the Ionian Revolt was all but ended. The next year, the Persians reduced the last rebel strongholds, and began the process of bringing peace to the region. The Ionian Revolt constituted the first major conflict between [[ancient Greece]] and Persia, and as such represents the first phase of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, Darius vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support of the revolt. Moreover, seeing that the myriad city states of Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his empire, he decided to conquer the whole of Greece. In 492 BC, the [[first Persian invasion of Greece]], the next phase of the Greco-Persian Wars, would begin as a direct consequence of the Ionian Revolt.

== Sources ==
{{Main|Herodotus}}

Practically the only primary source for the Ionian Revolt is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]].&lt;ref name = fine&gt;Fine, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NjeM0kcp8swC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq=Ionian+revolt#PPA272,M1 pp. 269–277.]&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus, who has been called the 'Father of History',&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, On the Laws I, 5&lt;/ref&gt; was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek—''Historia''; English—''[[Histories (Herodotus)|(The) Histories]]'') around 440–430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC).&lt;ref name = hxvi/&gt; Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it.&lt;ref name = hxvi/&gt; As Holland has it: "For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally."&lt;ref name = hxvi&gt;Holland, pp. ''xvi''–''xvii''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with [[Thucydides]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, e.g. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.22 I, 22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Fin15&gt;Finley, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the [[Siege of Sestos]]), and therefore evidently felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.&lt;ref name = Fin15/&gt; [[Plutarch]] criticised Herodotus in his essay "On The Malignity of Herodotus", describing Herodotus as "''Philobarbaros''" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. ''xxiv''.&lt;/ref&gt; A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained well read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=2008-01-18|author=David Pipes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080127105636/http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm |archivedate = January 27, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.&lt;ref name = h377&gt;Holland, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his ''Historia'', but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism.&lt;ref name = h377/&gt; Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.&lt;ref&gt;Fehling, pp. 1–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{Main|Ionian Revolt}}
In the dark age that followed the collapse of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilization]], significant numbers of Greeks had emigrated to [[Asia Minor]] and settled there. These settlers were from three tribal groups: the [[Aeolians]], [[Dorians]] and [[Ionians]].&lt;ref name = I14x&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;layout=;query=chapter%3D%23142;loc=1.141.1 I, 142–151]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ionians had settled about the coasts of [[Lydia]] and [[Caria]], founding the twelve cities which made up [[Ionia]].&lt;ref name = I14x/&gt; These cities were [[Miletus]], [[Myus]] and [[Priene]] in Caria; [[Ephesus]], [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]], [[Lebedos]], [[Teos]], [[Clazomenae]], [[Phocaea]] and [[Erythrae]] in Lydia; and the islands of [[Samos]] and [[Chios]].&lt;ref name = I142&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;layout=;query=chapter%3D%23142;loc=1.143.1 I, 142]&lt;/ref&gt;  The cities of Ionia had remained independent until they were conquered by the famous Lydian king [[Croesus]], in around 560 BC.&lt;ref name = I143&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%2326;layout=;loc=1.27.1 I, 26]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ionian cities then remained under Lydian rule until Lydia was in turn conquered by the nascent [[Achaemenid Empire]] of [[Cyrus the Great]].&lt;ref name = I141&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23141;layout=;loc=1.140.1 I, 141]&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule. Elsewhere in the empire, Cyrus was able to identify elite native groups to help him rule his new subjects—such as the priesthood of Judea.&lt;ref name = h147/&gt; No such group existed in Greek cities at this time; while there was usually an aristocracy, this was inevitably divided into feuding factions.&lt;ref name = h147&gt;Holland, p. 147–151.&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians thus settled for the sponsoring a [[tyrant]] in each Ionian city, even though this drew them into the Ionians' internal conflicts. Furthermore, a tyrant might develop an independent streak, and have to be replaced.&lt;ref name = h147/&gt; The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens' hatred, while staying in the favour of the Persians.&lt;ref name = h147/&gt;

[[File:Darius-Vase.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Darius I of Persia, as imagined by a Greek painter, 4th century BC]]

About 40 years after the Persian conquest of Ionia, and in the reign of the fourth Persian king, [[Darius the Great]], the stand-in Milesian tyrant [[Aristagoras]] found himself in this familiar predicament.&lt;ref name = h153&gt;Holland, pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt; In 500 BC, Aristagoras was approached by some exiles from [[Naxos Island|Naxos]], who asked him to take control of the island.&lt;ref name = V30&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23799;layout=;loc=5.31.1 V, 30]&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing an opportunity to strengthen his position in Miletus by conquering Naxos, Aristagoras approached the [[satrap]] of Lydia, [[Artaphernes]], proposing a joint attack on Naxos, to which Artaphernes assented.&lt;ref name = V31&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23800;layout=;loc=5.30.1 V, 31]&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition sailed in the spring of 499 BC but quickly descended into a debacle&lt;ref name = V33&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23801;layout=;loc=5.31.1 V, 33]&lt;/ref&gt; The force laid siege to the Naxians for four months, but eventually the Persians and Aristagoras both ran out of money. The force therefore sailed despondently back to the mainland.&lt;ref name = V34&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23803;layout=;loc=5.33.1 V, 34]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristagoras found himself in dire straits and fully expected to be stripped of his position by Artaphernes. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt.&lt;ref name = V35&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23804;layout=;loc=5.34.1 V, 35]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Herodotus presents the revolt as a consequence of Aristagoras's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway, the primary grievance being the tyrants installed by the Persians.&lt;ref name="fine"/&gt; Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia (and [[Aeolis]] and [[Doris (Asia Minor)|Doris]]), and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.&lt;ref name = h155&gt;Holland, pp. 155–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristagoras had brought all of Hellenic Asia Minor into revolt, but evidently realised that the Greeks would need other allies in order to fight the Persians.&lt;ref name = h157&gt;Holland, pp. 157–159.&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter of 499 BC, he sailed to mainland Greece to try to recruit allies. He failed to persuade the [[Sparta]]ns, but the cities of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] and [[Eretria]] agreed to support the rebellion.&lt;ref name = h157/&gt; In the spring of 498&amp;nbsp;BC, an Athenian force of twenty triremes, accompanied by five from Eretria, for a total of twenty-five triremes set sail for Ionia.&lt;ref name = h160&gt;Holland, pp. 160–162.&lt;/ref&gt; They joined up with the main Ionian force near Ephesus.&lt;ref name = V100&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23876;layout=;loc=5.99.1 V, 100]&lt;/ref&gt;
This force was then guided by the Ephesians through mountains to [[Sardis]], Artaphernes's satrapal capital.&lt;ref name = h160/&gt; The Greeks caught the Persians unawares, and were able to capture the lower city. However the lower city then caught fire, and the Greeks, demoralised, then retreated from the city, and began to make their way back to Ephesus.&lt;ref name = V101&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23878;layout=;loc=5.101.1 V, 101]&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians troops in Asia Minor followed the Greek force, catching them outside Ephesus. It is clear that the demoralised and tired Greeks were no match for the Persians, and were completely routed in the ensuing battle at Ephesus.&lt;ref name = h160/&gt; The Ionians who escaped the battle made for their own cities, while the remaining Athenians and Eretrians managed to return to their ships, and sailed back to Greece.&lt;ref name = h160/&gt;&lt;ref name = V102&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.102 V, 102]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ionian Revolt Campaign Map.png|300px|thumb|right|Main events of the Ionian Revolt]]

Despite these setbacks, the revolt spread further. The Ionians sent men to the [[Hellespont]] and [[Propontis]], and captured [[Byzantium]] and the other nearby cities.&lt;ref name = V103/&gt; They also persuaded the [[Caria]]ns to join the rebellion.&lt;ref name = V103&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23879;layout=;loc=5.104.1 V, 103]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, seeing the spread of the rebellion, the kingdoms of [[Cyprus]] also revolted against Persian rule without any outside persuasion.&lt;ref name = V104&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23880;layout=;loc=5.103.1 V, 104]&lt;/ref&gt; For the next three years, the Persian army and navy were fully occupied with fighting the rebellions in Caria and Cyprus, and Ionia seems to have had an uneasy peace during these years.&lt;ref name = board&gt;Boardman ''et al'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=nNDpPqeDjo0C&amp;pg=RA2-PA485&amp;dq=Battle+of+Pedasus+497+BC&amp;ei=Kj3rSZCZD6b0ygSIn_SYBQ pp. 481–490.]&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the Persian counter-offensive, Aristagoras, sensing the untenability of his position, decided to abandon his position as leader of Miletus, and of the revolt, and he left Miletus. Herodotus, who evidently has a rather negative view of him, suggests that Aristagoras simply lost his nerve and fled.&lt;ref name = V124&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.124 V, 124–126]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the sixth year of the revolt (494 BC), the Persian forces had regrouped. The available land forces were gathered into one army, and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re-subjugated Cypriots, and the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Cilicia]]ns and [[Phoenicia]]ns. The Persians headed directly to Miletus, paying little attention to other strongholds, presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its epicentre.&lt;ref name = VI6&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.6 VI, 6]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Medes|Median]] general [[Datis]], an expert on Greek affairs, was certainly dispatched to Ionia by Darius at this time. It is therefore possible that he was in overall command of this Persian offensive.&lt;ref name = fine/&gt; Hearing of the approach of this force, the Ionians met at the Panionium (the sacred meeting ground), and decided not to attempt to fight on land, leaving the Milesians to defend their walls. Instead, they opted to gather every ship they could, and make for the island of Lade, off the coast of Miletus, in order to "fight for Miletus at sea".&lt;ref name="VI6"/&gt;

Herodotus says that there were 600 ships in the Persian fleet,&lt;ref name = VI9&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.9 VI, 9]&lt;/ref&gt; provided by the [[Phoenicia]]ns (who were most eager to fight), the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Cilicia]]ns, and the Cypriots, whose own revolt had recently been subdued.&lt;ref name = VI6/&gt; The Persian fleet may have been commanded by the veteran [[Medes|Median]] general [[Datis]]; Persian records seem to suggest that he was sent by Darius to Ionia at around about the time of Lade.&lt;ref name = board/&gt; However, Herodotus does not name any Persian commanders in this campaign.

== Prelude ==
When the Persians arrived off the coast of Lade and learned the number of Ionian ships, they began to worry that they would not be able to defeat the Greeks, and feared Darius's wrath should they fail.&lt;ref name = VI9/&gt; The Ionian tyrants who had been expelled at the beginning of the revolt were present, and according to Herodotus, they were now given instructions by the Persians: &lt;blockquote&gt; "Men of Ionia, let each one of you now show that he has done good service to the king's house; let each one of you try to separate your own countrymen from the rest of the allied power. Set this promise before them: they will suffer no harm for their rebellion, neither their temples nor their houses will be burnt, nor will they in any way be treated more violently than before. But if they will not do so and are set on fighting, then utter a threat that will restrain them: if they are defeated in battle, they will be enslaved; we will make eunuchs of their boys, and carry their maidens captive to Bactra, and hand over their land to others."&lt;ref name = VI9/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The tyrants thus sent messages to their own kinsman, but the Ionians refused the offers. Critically, each group thought that only they had been approached—there does not seem to have been any discussion of this offer between the different contingents, and the possibility for treachery does not seem to have been realised.&lt;ref name = VI9 /&gt;

[[File:Model of a greek trireme.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Reconstructed model of a [[trireme]], the type of ship in use by both the Greek and Persian forces]]

The Ionians did however hold meetings to discuss the conduct of the battle. [[Dionysius of Phocaea|Dionysius]], the Phocaean general, offered to train and lead the Greek force: &lt;blockquote&gt; "Our affairs, men of Ionia, stand on the edge of a razor, whether to be free men or slaves, and runaway slaves at that. If you now consent to endure hardships, you will have toil for the present time, but it will be in your power to overcome your enemies and gain freedom; but if you will be weak and disorderly, I see nothing that can save you from paying the penalty to the king for your rebellion. Believe me and entrust yourselves to me; I promise you that (if the gods deal fairly with us) either our enemies shall not meet us in battle, or if they do they shall be utterly vanquished." &lt;ref name = VI11&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23913;layout=;loc=6.10.1 VI, 11]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Dionysius thus began an intensive training program, leading the fleet out every day to train the rowers in ramming manoeuvers, and the [[Marine (military)|marines]] in combat. For seven days the Ionians accepted this regime, but being unused to the hard work, they refused to obey thereafter, and stayed in camp instead.&lt;ref name = VI12&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23914;layout=;loc=6.11.1 VI, 12]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Herodotus, upon seeing the resultant discontent and division in the Ionian camp, the Samians decided to accept the Persian offer of lenience in return for desertion.&lt;ref name = VI13&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23915;layout=;loc=6.12.1 VI, 13]&lt;/ref&gt; However, some modern historians reject the notion of dissent in the Greek camp. Herodotus derived his account of Lade from the Samians themselves, and it is suggested that, seeking to excuse their treachery, they came up with this story.&lt;ref name="board"/&gt; At any rate, the Samians remained with the other Greeks in the run up to the battle.&lt;ref name = VI13/&gt;

== Battle ==
Soon after the rebellion against Dionysius, the Persian fleet moved to attack the Ionians, who sailed out to meet them. The ensuing battle was evidently confused, since Herodotus admits that "which of the Ionians were brave men or cowards then in that sea-fight I cannot exactly say; for they all blame each other".&lt;ref name = VI14&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23916;layout=;loc=6.13.1 VI, 14]&lt;/ref&gt; It is nevertheless clear that very early on in the battle, the Samian contingent hoisted their sails, as had been agreed, and fled the battlefield. However, 11 Samian ships refused to desert the other Ionians, and remained at the battle. At some later date, the Samians erected a pillar in their marketplace commemorating the bravery and sacrifice of these crews.&lt;ref name = VI14/&gt; Seeing the Samians leave, their neighbours on the western wing, the Lesbians, also fled. The whole west-wing of the Ionian battle line thus very quickly collapsed.&lt;ref name = VI14/&gt; Other Ionian contingents also fled as the situation became more desperate.

Only the large Chian navy seems to have stood their ground, perhaps accompanied by a few other ships. They fought valiantly, but had huge casualties.&lt;ref name = VI15&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23917;layout=;loc=6.16.1 VI, 15]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the remaining Chian ships sailed away back to Chios, thereby ending the battle.&lt;ref name = VI16&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.16 VI, 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
With the defeat of the Ionian fleet, the revolt was effectively over. Miletus was closely invested, the Persians "mining the walls and using every device against it, until they utterly captured it". According to Herodotus, most of the men were killed, and the women and children were enslaved.&lt;ref name = VI19&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23921;layout=;loc=6.18.1 VI, 19]&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence partially substantiates this, showing widespread signs of destruction, and abandonment of much of the city in the aftermath of Lade.&lt;ref name = board/&gt; However, some Milesians did remain in (or quickly returned to) Miletus, though the city would never recapture its former greatness.&lt;ref name = fine/&gt; Miletus was thus notionally "left empty of Milesians";&lt;ref name = VI22&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23924;layout=;loc=6.21.1 VI, 22]&lt;/ref&gt; the Persians took the city and coastal land for themselves, and gave the rest of the Milesian territory to Carians from [[Pedasus]].&lt;ref name = VI20&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23922;layout=;loc=6.21.1 VI, 20]&lt;/ref&gt; The captive Milesians were brought before Darius in [[Susa]], who settled them on the coast of the [[Persian Gulf]], near the mouth of the [[Tigris]].

[[File:Miletus agora.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The ruins of Miletus]]

Many Samians were appalled by the actions of their generals at Lade, and resolved to emigrate before their old tyrant, [[Aeaces]], returned to rule them. They accepted an invitation from the people of [[Messina|Zancle]] to settle on the coast of [[Sicily]], and took with them such Milesians as had escaped from the Persians.&lt;ref name = VI22/&gt; Samos itself was spared from destruction by the Persians because of the Samian defection at Lade.&lt;ref name = VI25&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23927;layout=;loc=6.26.1 VI, 25]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Dionysius of Phocaea went to Sicily, and established himself as a pirate, preying on Carthaginian ships.&lt;ref name = VI25/&gt;

Most of Caria surrendered to the Persians in aftermath of Lade, although some strongholds had to be captured through force.&lt;ref name = VI25/&gt; The Persian fleet and army wintered at Miletus, before setting out in 493 BC to finally stamp out the last embers of the revolt. They attacked and captured the islands of Chios, Lesbos and [[Ancient Tenedos|Tenedos]] and then moved over to the mainland, and captured each of the remaining cities of Ionia.&lt;ref name = VI31&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23933;layout=;loc=6.30.1 VI, 31]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the cities of Ionia were undoubtedly harrowed in the aftermath, none seems to have suffered quite the fate of Miletus.&lt;ref name = VI32&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23934;layout=;loc=6.31.1 VI, 32]&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian army then re-conquered the settlements on the Asian side of the Propontis, while the fleet sailed up the European coast of the Hellespont, taking each settlement in turn. With all of Asia Minor now firmly returned to Persian rule, the revolt was finally over.&lt;ref name = VI33&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.33 VI, 33]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Persians, the only unfinished business that remained by the end of 493 BC was to exact punishment on Athens and Eretria for supporting the revolt.&lt;ref name = h175&gt;Holland, pp. 175–177.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ionian Revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius's empire, and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. Darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece, beginning with the destruction of Athens and Eretria.&lt;ref name = h175/&gt; The [[first Persian invasion of Greece]] thus began in the following year, 492 BC, when [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] was dispatched (via Ionia) to complete the pacification of the land approaches to Greece, and push on to Athens and Eretria if possible.&lt;ref name = VI43&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;layout=;query=chapter%3D%23945;loc=6.42.1 VI, 43]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thrace]] was re-subjugated, having broken loose from Persian rule during the revolts, and [[Macedon]] compelled to become a vassal of Persia. However, progress was halted by a naval disaster.&lt;ref name = VI43/&gt; A second expedition was launched in 490 BC under [[Datis]] and [[Artaphernes (son of Artaphernes)|Artaphernes]], son of the satrap Artaphernes. This amphibious force sailed across the Aegean, subjugating the [[Cyclades]], before arriving off [[Euboea]]. Eretria was [[Siege of Eretria|besieged]], captured and destroyed, and the force then moved onto [[Attica]]. Landing at the Bay of [[Marathon]], they were met by an Athenian army, and defeated in the famous [[Battle of Marathon]], ending the first Persian attempt to subdue Greece.&lt;ref name = VI94&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231000;layout=;loc=6.95.1 VI, 94–116]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''bikini bridge''' was an [[Internet hoax]]. It originated in the United States&lt;ref name=Dewey20160407/&gt; on January 5, 2014, created by users of the "/b/" section on the [[imageboard]] [[4chan]] as a parody of popular [[thinspiration]] memes.&lt;ref name=huffpo/&gt; It is defined as "when bikini bottoms are suspended between the two hip bones, causing a space between the bikini and the lower abdomen".&lt;ref name=Cunningham2014/&gt; According to a posting on the website, users intended to spread content across [[social media]] regarding bikini bridges, but then similarly disseminating them "throughout parts of the Internet known to be biased on the subject of weight" to deliberately cause offence.&lt;ref name=dot20140106/&gt;

On January 6, the online publication ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' reported it as a hoax,&lt;ref name=dot20140106/&gt; as did U.S. television program ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' on January 7.&lt;ref name=today/&gt; Several commentators critiqued the hoax for displaying insensitivity or being "dangerous"&lt;ref name=Dewey012014/&gt; for women with an [[eating disorder]].&lt;ref name=Lew2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dewey092014/&gt;&lt;ref name=eonline/&gt;

The phenomenon has been ranked as an unhealthy [[body image]] obsession in the West along with "ab crack" and "[[thigh gap]]", which rode a media wave in 2012–2013;&lt;ref name=Welt/&gt; and the Chinese trends, the "Collarbone Challenge", and the "A4 Challenge" in 2016 in China.&lt;ref name=Dewey20160407/&gt;

{{2018 Winter Olympics}}
A number of notable controversies and concerns associated with the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in [[Pyeongchang County|PyeongChang]], [[South Korea]], emerged which were the subject of public debate and media commentary.

===Official sanctions===

[[File:Olympic Athlete from Russia logo 2018.svg|thumb|upright|Approved OAR logo]]
On 5 December 2017, the IOC announced that the Russian Olympic Committee had been suspended effective immediately from the 2018 Winter Olympics. Athletes who had no previous drug violations and a consistent history of drug testing were to be allowed to compete under the [[Olympic Flag]] as an "Olympic Athlete from Russia" (OAR).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Under the terms of the decree, Russian government officials were barred from the Games, and neither the country's flag nor anthem would be present. The Olympic Flag and [[Olympic Anthem]] will be used instead,{{cn|date=February 2018}} and on 20 December 2017 the IOC proposed an alternate logo for the uniforms (seen at right).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-s-olympic-athlete-from-russia-implementation-group-releases-guidelines-for-uniforms-accessories-and-equipment|title=IOC's OAR implementation group releases guidelines for uniforms accessories and equipment's|date=20 December 2017|work=olympic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOC President [[Thomas Bach]] said that "after following due process [the IOC] has issued proportional sanctions for this systematic manipulation while protecting the clean athletes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/ioc-bars-russian-athletes-and-officials-from-winter-olympic-games-59818 | title=IOC Bars Russian Athletes and Officials From Winter Olympic Games | work=The Moscow Times | date=5 December 2017 | accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2018, the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] had sanctioned 43 Russian athletes from the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] and banned them from competing in the 2018 edition and all other future Olympic Games as part of the [[Oswald Commission]]. All but one of these athletes appealed against their bans to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] (CAS). The court overturned the sanctions on 28 athletes meaning that their Sochi medals and results are reinstated but decided that there was sufficient evidence against 11 athletes to uphold their Sochi sanctions. The IOC said in a statement that "the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation" and that "this [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping". The IOC found it important to note that CAS Secretary General "insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent" and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision. The court also decided that none of the 39 athletes should be banned from all future Olympic Games, but only the 2018 Games. Three Russian athletes are still waiting for their hearing, which will be conducted after the 2018 Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-statement-on-cas-decision|title=IOC Statement on CAS Decision|date=1 February 2018|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]]|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the CAS decision was announced, the four-time Olympic champion in biathlon [[Alexander Tikhonov]] demanded to call to account the President of the IOC for "false accusations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IOC decided to close the justified Russians the way to the Games|url=http://newsme.com.ua/en/sport/3957409/|work=NewsMe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia’s sports minister Pavel Kolobkov wanted the IOC to ensure the participation of these Russian athletes at the Olympics in Pyeongchang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia to request lifting Olympic bans after CAS decision: minister|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-doping-olympics-russia-minister-court/russia-to-request-lifting-olympic-bans-after-cas-decision-minister-idUSKBN1FL574|work=Reuters|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An original pool of 500 Russian athletes was put forward for consideration for the games and 111 were immediately removed from consideration. The remaining athletes had to meet pre-games conditions such as further pre-games tests and reanalysis from stored samples. Only if these requirements are met, can the athletes be considered for invitation to the games. None of the athletes who had been sanctioned by the Oswald Commission were still in the pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/reduced-pool-of-russian-athletes-and-officials-who-can-be-considered-for-invitation-to-pyeongchang-2018-determined|title=Reduced Pool of Russian Athletes and Officials Who Can Be Considered for Invitation to PyeongChang 2018 Determined|date=25 January 2018|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]]|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The final number of neutral Russian athletes invited to compete was 169.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/sports/olympics/russia-doping.html|title=Russia Is Barred From Winter Olympics.

On 22 February [[Alexander Krushelnitskiy]] of the Olympic Athletes from Russia team was stripped of his bronze medal in [[Curling at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Mixed doubles tournament|mixed doubles curling]] after testing positive for [[meldonium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Winter Olympics: Russia curler Alexander Krushelnitsky stripped of bronze for doping |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/winter-olympics/43152299 |accessdate=22 February 2018|work=[[BBC]]|date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction in Russia===
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev with sportspeople (2018-02-28).jpg|thumb|Russian Prime Minister [[Dmitry Medvedev]] with medal winners from Russia, 28 February 2018]]
In the past, [[Vladimir Putin]], the [[President of Russia]], and other officials had said that it would be a humiliation for Russia if its athletes were not allowed to compete under the Russian flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=19 October 2017 |title=Putin says US pressured IOC to ban Russia from Winter Games |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/putin-says-us-pressured-ioc-ban-russia-winter-175151912--oly.html |work=[[Yahoo Sports]] |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his spokesman later said that no boycott had been discussed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ruiz |first1=Rebecca C. |last2=Panja |first2=Tariq |date=5 December 2017 |title=Russia Banned From Winter Olympics by I.O.C. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/sports/olympics/ioc-russia-winter-olympics.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the IOC decision was announced, [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], the head of [[Chechnya]], announced that no [[Chechens|Chechen]] athletes would participate under a neutral flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.championat.com/other/news-2972433-kadyrov-ni-odin-chechenskij-sportsmen-ne-budet-vystupat-pod-nejtralnym-flagom.html|title=Кадыров: ни один чеченский спортсмен не будет выступать под нейтральным флагом|trans-title=|website=Championat.com|access-date=6 December 2017 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 December, Putin stated that the Russian government would not prevent any athletes from participating at the Games as individuals, but there were calls from other politicians for a boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.interfax.ru/sport/590596 |title=Жириновский предложил отказаться от участия в Олимпиаде-2018 |trans-title= |publisher=Interfax.ru |date= |accessdate=6 December 2017 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/12/06/sport/russia-doping-2018-winter-olympics-vladimir-putin-pyeongchang/index.html|title=Vladimir Putin won't tell Russian athletes to boycott Winter Olympics|date=6 December 2017|publisher=CNN|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gennady Zyuganov]], a leader of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]], proposed to send fans with a Soviet [[Victory Banner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mk.ru/politics/2018/01/30/zyuganov-predlozhil-otpravit-na-olimpiadu-bolelshhikov-so-znamenem-pobedy.html|title=Зюганов предложил отправить на Олимпиаду болельщиков со знаменем Победы|trans-title= |date=30 January 2018|work=mk.ru|accessdate=5 February 2018|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Sergey Lavrov]] has said that the United States "fears honest competition",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tass.com/politics/985069|title=US fears honest competition in energy, arms industry and sports, Lavrov warns|date=15 January 2018|publisher=[[TASS]]|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; affirming Vladimir Putin's position who had said that the United States used its influence within the [[International Olympic Committee]] to "orchestrate the doping scandal".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-41934604|title=Putin: Doping allegations 'US plot against Russian election'|date=9 November 2017|work=bbc.com|accessdate=18 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'', a popular Russian newspaper, 86% of the Russian population oppose participating in the Olympics under a neutral flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spb.kp.ru/daily/26772/3805611/|title=Опрос "КП": Стоит ли спортсменам из России ехать на Олимпиаду под нейтральным флагом|trans-title= |date=20 December 2017|work=kp.ru|accessdate=4 February 2018|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the OAR designation, many Russian fans still attended the Games, wearing the Russian colours and chanting "Russia!" in unison, in an act of defiance against the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/winter-olympics-2018/russian-fans-spurn-stupid-ban-athletes-olympic-games-n847886 | title=Russian fans spurn ‘stupid’ ban on athletes at Olympic Games | publisher=NBC News | first=Eirk | last=Ortiz | date= 14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions in Western media===

The IOC's decision was criticized by Jack Robertson, primary investigator of the Russian doping program on behalf of the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]], who said that the IOC has issued "a non-punitive punishment meant to save face while protecting the [IOC’s] and Russia’s commercial and political interests". He also emphasized that Russian whistleblowers provided empirical evidence that "99 percent of [their] national-level teammates were doping." According to Robertson, "[WADA] has discovered that when a Russian athlete [reaches] the national level, he or she [has] no choice in the matter: [it is] either dope, or you’re done". "There is currently no intelligence I have seen or heard about that indicates the state-sponsored doping program has ceased", he added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nytimes.com/2017/12/27/opinion/2018-winter-olympics-russia.html|title=The 2018 Winter Olympics Are Already Tainted|work=The New York Times|date=27 December 2017|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was also reported that Russian officials intensively lobbied US politicians in an apparent attempt to achieve [[Grigory Rodchenkov|Grigory Rodchenkov's]] (main whistleblower) extradition to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1059507/ioc-accused-of-cowardice-for-failing-to-address-russian-retaliation-against-rodchenkov|title=IOC accused of cowardice for failing to address Russian retaliation against Rodchenkov|work=Inside the Games|date=26 December 2017|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justin Peters of [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'' magazine]] wrote that the IOC "ended up with a situation that seemed to negate the entire point of the sanctions against Russia. The IOC did not want there to be a Russian Olympic team at the Pyeongchang Games. And yet the hockey, curling, and figure-skating arenas are full of teams of Russian Olympians ... [this is] a half-hearted wrist slap issued by an entity that appears more interested in saving face than in protecting athletes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://slate.com/culture/2018/02/olympic-athletes-from-russia-is-a-craven-euphemism-for-a-craven-olympic-games.html|title="Olympic Athletes From Russia" Is a Craven Euphemism for a Craven Olympic Games|first=Justin|last=Peters|work=Slate.com|date=12 February 2018|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IOC Decision to overturn life bans of 28 Russian athletes and restore their medals met fierce criticism among Olympic officials, including [[President of the International Olympic Committee|IOC president]] [[Thomas Bach]] who had said this decision is "extremely disappointing and surprising." [[Grigory Rodchenkov]]'s lawyer has said that "the CAS decision would allow doped athletes to escape without punishment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-olympics-ioc-chief-bach-disappointed-doping-bans-lifted/29017362.html|title=IOC Chief Disappointed By Court Lifting Doping Ban On Russians|work=rferl.org|date=4 February 2018|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"[CAS decision] provides yet another ill-gotten gain for the corrupt Russian doping system generally, and Putin specifically”, - he added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://olympics.nbcsports.com/2018/02/01/russia-olympic-doping-bans-lifted/|title=28 Russians have Olympic doping bans lifted|work=nbcsports.com|date=1 February 2018|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 September 2017, South Korea’s President [[Moon Jae-in]] said the country is pushing to ensure security at Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games amid [[2017 North Korea crisis|rising tensions over nuclear tests and a series of missile launches]] conducted by North Korea during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=South Korea's Moon says pushing to guarantee safety at Pyeongchang Olympics |publisher=Reuters |date=20 September 2017 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-southkorea-olympi/south-koreas-moon-says-pushing-to-guarantee-safety-at-pyeongchang-olympics-idUSKCN1BU2YE}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the next day, French [[Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports (France)|Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports]] [[Laura Flessel-Colovic]] said France’s Winter Olympics team will boycott the games unless South Korea's security is guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Olympics - France to skip 2018 Winter Games if security not assured |publisher=Reuters |date=22 September 2017 |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-olympics-2018/olympics-france-to-skip-2018-winter-games-if-security-risk-too-great-idUKKCN1BW2NK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September 2017, Austria and Germany joined France in considering not attending the Games. Karl Stoss, head of Austria’s national Olympic committee, said that, "if the situation worsens and the security of our athletes is no longer guaranteed, we will not go to South Korea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Olympics: North Korea triggers 2018 Winter Olympics security scare |publisher=The Straits Times | date=23 September 2017 |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/olympics-france-to-skip-2018-winter-games-if-security-risk-too-great-in-south-korea}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later, Laura Flessel-Colovic reaffirmed France's participation in the games. Austria and Germany did not boycott the Games.

[[Kim Yo-jong]], the younger sister of dictator Kim Jong-un, attended the opening ceremony and shook hands with the South Korean President [[Moon Jae-in]]. This marked the first time since the [[Korean War]] that a member of the ruling [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]] had visited South Korea.&lt;ref name="theg_USvi"&gt;{{Cite web | title = US vice-president skips Olympics dinner in snub to North Korea officials | last = Haas | first = Benjamin | work = the Guardian | date = 9 February 2018 | accessdate = 2018-02-09 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/09/kim-jong-uns-sister-arrives-in-south-korea-for-winter-olympics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==During the Games==
===Scheduling and small crowds===
Like in recent Olympic games, the scheduling of several events were influenced primarily by United States broadcast rightsholder [[Olympics on NBC|NBC]] (due to the substantial fees NBC has paid for rights to the Olympics, the IOC has allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible). [[Eastern Time Zone|U.S. Eastern Time]] is 14 hours behind [[Time in South Korea|Korean Time]].&lt;ref name="SVG20180202"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sportsvideo.org/2018/01/19/pyeongchang-2018-nbc-to-present-live-nightly-primetime-coverage-across-all-time-zones/|title=PyeongChang 2018: NBC To Air Live, Nightly Primetime Coverage Across All Time Zones; Will Live-Stream Opening Ceremony|last=Staff|first=SVG|work=Sports Video Group|access-date=2 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, figure skating events were scheduled around 10:00 Korean Time in the morning so they could air live on NBC around 20:00 U.S. Eastern Time during the U.S. [[primetime]] hours, disrupting competitors' regular routines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-2018-figs-times/figure-skating-skaters-given-the-slip-by-early-starts-idUSKBN1FT14M | title=Figure skating: Skaters given the slip by early starts | work=Reuters | date=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2018/02/09/early-starts-at-olympics-cause-figure-skaters-concern/110280272/ | title=Early starts at Olympics cause figure skaters concern | work=Associated Press | publisher=USA Today | date=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and leading to small crowds at the arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/winter-olympics-figure-skating-arena-empty-nbc-time-zone-2018-2 | title=The first major Olympic event was nearly empty because of the American time zone demands | work=Business Insider | first=Scott | last=Davis | date=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/sports/olympics/figure-skating-schedule.html | title=For Olympic Figure Skaters, a New Meaning to Morning Routine | newspaper=The New York Times | first=Jere | last=Longman | date=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, eight of the eleven biathlon events were scheduled at night, forcing biathletes to both ski and shoot under floodlights, colder temperatures, and gustier winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2018/02/10/biathletes-battling-difficult-conditions-at-winter-olympics/110298058/ | title=Biathletes battling difficult conditions at Winter Olympics | work=Associated Press | publisher=USA Today | date=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NBC analyst comment===
{{Main|Joshua Cooper Ramo#Comment on Japan–Korea relations}}
During the opening ceremony, NBC analyst [[Joshua Cooper Ramo]] noted that [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japan occupied Korea]] from 1910 to 1945, and then added, "But every Korean will tell you that Japan is a cultural and technological and economic example that has been so important to their own transformation." In ''[[The Korea Times]]'', Jung Min-ho called the comment "incorrect and insensitive," writing that "Tens of thousands of Koreans and non-Koreans alike have criticized Ramo and NBC Sports on their social media, urging them to correct this misinformation and apologize." In response to this backlash, NBC issued an on-air apology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chase |first=Chris |url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/winter-olympics/nbc-apologizes-to-korean-people-after-correspondents-ignorant-insensitive-comment/ar-BBIXGgh |title=NBC apologizes to Korean people after correspondent's 'ignorant, 'insensitive' comment |website=MSN.com |date=10 February 2018 |accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ramo was fired from his job at NBC the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/nbc-fires-analyst-ignorant-insensitive-on-air-comment-article-1.3813896 |title=NBC fires analyst after 'ignorant, insensitive' on-air comment |work=New York Daily News |agency=Associated Press |date=11 February 2018 |accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High winds===
Many snow events were plagued by high [[wind]]s, causing dangerous conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/winter-olympics-2018/2018/02/12/wild-winds-wreak-havoc-winter-olympics-pyeongchang/329676002/|title=Wild winds wreak havoc at Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang|website=USA TODAY|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An opening ceremony took place in extreme [[cold]] with a wind chill temperature of -22°C and some visitors left early because of the harsh cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wind chill expected to hit -22°C for Pyeongchang Olympics opening ceremony|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/830911.html|work=The Hankyoreh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pyeongchang in a cold sweat over freezing opening ceremony|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-2018-weather/pyeongchang-in-a-cold-sweat-over-freezing-opening-ceremony-idUSKBN1E11P7|work=Reuters|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the qualification of the [[Snowboarding at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Women's slopestyle|women's slopestyle]] was cancelled, there were still massive winds in the final session. Of the 25 participants, only five managed to stay on their feet during the first run. No snowboarders recorded two clear runs.&lt;ref name=FIS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nu.nl/olympische-winterspelen-pyeongchang-2018/5129825/skifederatie-verdedigt-maas-bekritiseerd-startbesluit-slopestyle.html|title=Skifederatie verdedigt door Maas bekritiseerd startbesluit slopestyle |website=www.nu.nl|language=dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several snowboarders said that the final was "irresponsible", "too dangerous" and "should never have been held".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/winter-olympics-2018/2018/02/12/olympic-slopestyle-competition-never-should-have-been-held-massive-winds/328257002/|title=Slopestyle competition never should have been held in massive winds|website=USA TODAY|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nos.nl/pyeongchang2018/artikel/2216649-maas-finale-slopestyle-verpest-door-harde-wind.html|title=Maas: finale slopestyle verpest door harde wind|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/winter-olympics/42968668|title=Winter Olympics: Women's slopestyle final 'too dangerous' as winds cause havoc|date=12 February 2018|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the FIS, the conditions were "within the norm".&lt;ref name=FIS /&gt;

On 14 February there was such a strong wind on the Olympic Park, that spectators were sent inside to shelter for the wind and all activities of the Olympic park were postponed. Parts of tents became detached and temporary structures and [[Coca-Cola]] fridges were broken. The media tents had been closed as well due to high winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nos.nl/pyeongchang2018/artikel/2217102-harde-wind-in-olympisch-park-iedereen-moet-binnen-blijven.html|title=Ergste wind in olympisch park voorbij: openbare ruimtes blijven dicht|publisher=|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological  issues at Jeongseon Alpine Centre===
Environmental groups have raised concerns surrounding the deforestation from the slopes of [[Gariwangsan|Gariwang mountain]] to build the [[Jeongseon Alpine Centre]]. Officials claim it is necessary as it is the only slope that will accommodate Olympic requirements and the forest will be restored after the games are done. Environmental groups are skeptical as the forest includes old growth of ancient and rare species. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Olympics: Olympic organisers destroy 'sacred' South Korean forest to create ski run |publisher=The Guardian | date=3 January 2018 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/16/olympic-organisers-destroy-sacred-south-korean-forest-to-create-ski-run}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exclusion of Samsung smartphones to Iranian and North Korean athletes===
Both the [[International Olympic Committee]] and the [[PyeongChang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic &amp; Paralympic Winter Games | PyeongChang Organizing Committee]] decided to exclude Iranian and North Korean athletes from their free giveaway of [[Samsung Galaxy Note 8]] smartphones. The decision was due to the concern and delay over confirming whether giving away mobile devices to Iranian and North Korean athletes would violate the UN sanctions against Iran and North Korea. In response, the Iranian government summoned the South Korean envoy to complain about the situation.&lt;ref name="Dehghan 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Dehghan | first=Saeed Kamali | title=Iran furious as athletes miss out on Winter Olympics smartphones | website=the Guardian | date=2018-02-08 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/feb/08/iran-furious-as-athletes-miss-out-on-winter-olympics-samsung-smartphones | access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the IOC confirmed that distributing mobile devices would not violate the UN sanction of Iran, which is being uplifted after Iran's [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|JCPOA]] in 2015, all participating athletes were given the Galaxy Note 8 regardless of their nationalities. However, due to the still active UN sanction, North Korean athletes were given the smart phones on the condition that they would return the devices to the organizing committee before going back to their home country.&lt;ref name="Editorial 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Editorial | first=Reuters | title=IOC clears Iran, North Korea for gift after Samsung phone row | website=Reuters | date=2018-02-08 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-2018-iran-samsung/olympics-south-korean-envoy-summoned-after-iranians-excluded-from-samsung-phone-gift-idUSKBN1FS1LE | access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Money Today 2018"&gt;{{cite web | last=Seo | first=Jin Wook | title=평창올림픽 '갤노트8' 이란 선수들도 받는다| website=Money Today | date=2018-02-09 | url=http://news.mt.co.kr/mtview.php?no=2018020910325090140 | access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dog meat trade===
The Winter Olympics have again caused comments about the [[dog meat]] trade issue in Korea. Figure skater [[Meagan Duhamel]] complained that eating dog meat is common and legal in Korea. Also speed skater [[Jan Blokhuijsen]] made a comment during a press conference to the host South Koreans to "treat dogs better in this country", criticizing [[Dog meat consumption in South Korea|dog meat eating culture of South Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/dutch-apologies-galore-after-double-faux-pas-at-olympics/2018/02/22/642b1b4e-17b5-11e8-930c-45838ad0d77a_story.html |title= Dutch apologies galore after double faux pas at Olympics |author= Raf Casert, AP |date= 22 February 2018 |publisher= |via= www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs are bred and raised for consumption, allegedly under poor conditions. Numerous activist groups have documented cases of dogs being burned, electrocuted, beaten and boiled alive. The myth, which states that battering a dog would increase the tenderness of its meat, is still believed by some people in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Winter Olympics: Spotlight shines on Korean dog meat trade|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/winter-olympics-2018/2018/02/07/dog-meat-trade-south-korea-winter-olympics-2018/310785002/|work=USA TODAY|date=7 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the run-up to the Olympics, South Korea closed its biggest dog meat market.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1218">'''Corta Jaca''' is a figure from the Bronze level syllabus of the [[Samba (ballroom dance)|ballroom Samba]] dance, danced in [[closed position]].

It may also be used in other dances, such as [[Cumbia]] or [[Balboa (dance)|Balboa]]&lt;ref name=novelty&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-_WrjuhM3sgC&amp;pg=PA63 p. 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The basic rhythm of the figure is Sqqqqqq. The leader takes a slow step forward with right foot (heel), and then steps forward/replace/back/replace/forward/replace. Steps forward are taken with "digging" the heel. Steps forward and back may be taken slightly sideways, then the "replace" steps are with slight slide leftwards. The follower's steps are opposite.&lt;ref name=novelty/&gt;&lt;ref name=dancen&gt;[http://www.dancecentral.info/ballroom/international-style/samba/corta-jaca]&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure may also involve gradual rotation. It may also be commenced from either foot, or either forward or back.&lt;ref name=novelty/&gt;&lt;ref name=dancen/&gt;

'''Dieter Dengler''' (May 22, 1938&amp;nbsp;– February 7, 2001) was a German-born [[United States Navy]] [[Naval aviator|aviator]] during the [[Vietnam War]] and later a private aircraft test pilot and commercial airline pilot.  He was one of two survivors, the other being [[Phisit Intharathat]], out of seven [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] ([[POW]]s) who escaped from a [[Pathet Lao]] prison camp in [[Laos]]. He was rescued after 23 days on the run&lt;ref&gt;[http://rescuedawnthetruth.com/ Rescue Dawn: The Truth] Retrieved January 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; following six months of torture and imprisonment and was the first captured U.S. airman to escape enemy captivity during the Vietnam war.&lt;ref&gt;Time magazine October 14, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0219048/ | title=Dieter Dengler (1938–2001) |date= |publisher=IMDb |accessdate=October 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and early life==
Dieter Dengler was born and raised in the small town of [[Wildberg, Baden-Württemberg|Wildberg]], in the [[Black Forest]] region of the German state of [[Baden-Württemberg]]. He grew up not knowing his father, who had been drafted into the German army in 1939 and was killed during [[World War II]] on the Eastern Front during the winter of 1943/44.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Henderson|title=Hero Found: The Greatest POW Escape of the Vietnam War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DR2YEENni-sC&amp;pg=PA5|date=24 May 2011|publisher=HarperCollins|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dieter became very close to his mother and brothers.  Dengler's maternal grandfather, Hermann Schnuerle, refused to vote for [[Adolf Hitler]] in the 1934 elections (which was considered a referendum on Hitler).  Subsequently he was paraded around town with a placard around his neck, was spat upon and was then sent to labor in a rock mine for a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Henderson|title=Hero Found: The Greatest POW Escape of the Vietnam War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DR2YEENni-sC&amp;pg=PA4|date=24 May 2011|publisher=HarperCollins|pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dengler credited his grandfather's resolve as a major inspiration during his time in Laos. His grandfather's steadfastness despite the great risks was one reason Dengler refused a [[North Vietnamese]] demand that he sign a document condemning American aggression in [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Henderson |first=Bruce B. |year=2011 |title=Hero Found: The Greatest POW Escape of the Vietnam War |location=New York |publisher=Harper |isbn=978-0-06-157137-4 |pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dengler's first experience with aircraft was during World War II when he witnessed an Allied fighter plane firing its guns as it flew very close past a window young Dieter was peering out of in his hometown. From that moment on, Dengler said he knew that he wanted to be a pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Henderson|title=Hero Found: The Greatest POW Escape of the Vietnam War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DR2YEENni-sC&amp;pg=PA6|date=24 May 2011|publisher=HarperCollins|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He grew up in extreme poverty but always found ways to help his family survive. Dieter and his brothers would go into bombed-out buildings, tear off wallpaper and bring it to his mother to boil for the nutrients in the wheat-based wallpaper paste. When members of the small group of Moroccans who lived in the area would slaughter sheep for their meals Dieter would sneak over to their lodgings to take the scraps and leftovers they wouldn't eat and his mother would make dinner from them. He also built a bicycle by scavenging from dumps. Dieter was apprenticed to a blacksmith at the age of 14. The blacksmith and the other boys, who worked six days a week building giant clocks and clock faces to repair German cathedrals, regularly beat him. Later in life Dieter actually thanked his master "for his disciplined training and for helping Dieter become more capable, self-reliant and yes, 'tough enough to survive'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Henderson |first=Bruce B. |year=2011 |title=Hero Found: The Greatest POW Escape of the Vietnam War |location=New York |publisher=Harper |isbn=978-0-06-157137-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After seeing an ad in an American magazine, expressing a need for pilots, he decided to go to the United States. Although a family friend agreed to sponsor him he lacked money for passage and came up with a plan to independently salvage brass and other metals to sell.

In 1956, when he turned 18 and upon completion of his apprenticeship, Dengler hitchhiked to [[Hamburg]] and spent two weeks surviving on the streets before the ship set sail for New York City. While on the ship he saved fruit and sandwiches for the coming days and when going through customs the agent was astonished when the food tumbled out of his shirt. He lived on the streets of [[Manhattan]] for just over a week and eventually found his way to an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] recruiter.  He was assured that piloting aircraft was what the Air Force was all about so he enlisted in June 1957 and went to [[basic training]] at [[Lackland AFB]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. After basic training, Dengler spent two years peeling potatoes and then transferred to a [[fleet vehicle|motor pool]] as a mechanic. His qualifications as a machinist led to an assignment as a [[gunsmith]]. He passed the test for aviation cadets but was told that only college grads were selected to be pilots and his enlistment expired before he was selected for pilot training.

After his discharge Dengler joined his brother working in a bakery shop near San Francisco and enrolled in [[San Francisco City College]], then transferred to the [[College of San Mateo]], where he studied aeronautics. Upon completion of two years of college he applied for the US Navy [[Aviation Cadet Training Program (USN)|aviation cadet program]] and was accepted.

Dieter would do whatever it took to become a pilot. In his inaugural flight at primary flight training, for example, the instructor told Dieter that if he became airsick and vomited in the cockpit that he would receive a "down" on his record. Students were only allowed three downs then they would wash out of flight training. The instructor of course, took the plane through spins and loops causing Dieter to become dizzy and disoriented. Knowing he was about to vomit and not wanting to receive a "down" Dieter took off his boot, threw up into it and put it back on. At the end of the flight the instructor checked the cockpit and could smell the vomit, but couldn't find any evidence of it. He didn't get a "down".

After his completion of flight training Dengler went to the [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi]], [[Texas]] for training as an attack pilot in the Douglas [[A-1 Skyraider|AD Skyraider]]. He joined VA-145 while the squadron was on shore duty at [[Naval Air Station Alameda]], [[California]]. In 1965 the squadron joined the carrier {{USS|Ranger|CV-61|6}}. In December the carrier set sail for the coast of Vietnam.  He was stationed initially at [[Dixie Station (Vietnam War)|Dixie Station]], off South Vietnam then moved north to [[Yankee Station]] for operations against North Vietnam.

==Shot down==
[[File:Skyraider landing USN.jpg|thumb|200px|A Navy [[A-1 Skyraider]] from VA-15 catches a wire during carrier operations.]]
On February 1, 1966, the day after the carrier began flying missions from Yankee Station, [[Lieutenant, Junior Grade]] Dengler launched from the ''Ranger'' with three other aircraft on an interdiction mission against a truck convoy that had been reported in North Vietnam. Thunderstorms forced the pilots to divert to their secondary target, a road intersection located west of the [[Mu Gia Pass]] in [[Laos]].  At the time, U.S. air operations in Laos were classified "secret". Visibility was poor due to smoke from burning fields, and upon rolling in on the target, LTJG Dengler and the remainder of his flight lost sight of one another. Visibility was poor, and as Dengler rolled his Skyraider in on the target after flying for two-and-a-half hours into enemy territory, he was hit by anti-aircraft fire.

"There was a large explosion on my right side," he remembered when interviewed shortly before his death in 2001.

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was like lightning striking. The right wing was gone. The airplane seemed to cartwheel through the sky in slow motion. There were more explosions - boom, boom, boom - and I was still able to guide the plane into a clearing in Laos.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He said: "Many times, people have asked me if I was afraid. Just before dying, there is no more fear. I felt I was floating."

Thrown 100&amp;nbsp;ft from the plane in a crash-landing, Dengler lay unconscious for a few minutes before running into the jungle to hide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-496091/Tortured-razor-sharp-bamboo-fed-alive-ants-The-story-PoWs-incredible-escape-Vietnam.html&lt;/ref&gt;

When his squadron mates realized that he had been downed, they remained confident that he would be rescued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skyraider.org/skyassn/dengler/dengler.htm | title=Lt Dieter Dengler, USN Escape from Laos Navy |date= |publisher=The A-1 Skyraider Association |accessdate=October 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Sense-of-history-drives-writer-to-tell-POW-tale-3180178.php | title=Sense of history drives writer to tell POW tale |date=July 30, 2010 |publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc |accessdate=October 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evasion, captivity and rescue==
{{Story|date=December 2007}}

===Capture===
Immediately after he was shot down, Dengler smashed his [[survival radio]] and hid most of his other survival equipment to keep Vietnamese or Lao search parties from finding it. The day after being shot down Dengler was apprehended by [[Pathet Lao]] troops, the Laotian equivalent of the communist [[Viet Cong|National Liberation Front]].

He was marched through the jungle, was tied on the ground to four stakes spreadeagled in order to stop him escaping at night. In the morning his face would be swollen from mosquito bites and he was unable to see. After an early escape attempt he was recaptured while drinking from a spring. According to Dengler he was tortured in retaliation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I had escaped from them, [and] they wanted to get even.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was hung upside down by his ankles with a nest of biting ants over his face until he lost consciousness, suspended in a freezing well at night - so that if sleep came, he might drown. On other occasions he was dragged through villages by a [[water buffalo]], to the amusement of his guards, as they goaded the animal with a whip. He was asked by Pathet Lao officials to sign a document condemning the United States, but he refused and as a result he was tortured as tiny wedges of bamboo were inserted under his fingernails and into incisions on his body which grew and festered.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"They were always thinking of something new to do to me" Dengler recalled. "One guy made a rope tourniquet around my upper arm. He inserted a piece of wood, and twisted and twisted until my nerves cut against the bone. The hand was completely unusable for six months."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After some weeks Dengler was handed over to the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]]. As they marched him through a village, a man slipped Dengler's engagement ring from his finger. Dengler complained to his guards. They found the culprit, summarily chopped off his finger with a machete and handed the ring back to Dengler.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I realized right there and then that you don't fool around with the Viet Cong", he said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dengler had trained in escaping and survival at the navy [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape|SERE survival school]], where he had twice escaped from the mock-[[POW camp]] run by SERE instructors and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] guards and was planning a third escape when the training ended.&lt;ref name=renamed_from_15_on_20130320020227&gt;{{cite book|last=Henderson|first=Bruce|title=Hero Found: The Greatest POW Escape of the Vietnam War|year=2010|publisher=Harper|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-157136-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also set a record as the only student to actually gain weight (three pounds) during the SERE course; his childhood experiences had made him unafraid of eating whatever he could find and he had feasted on food the course instructors had thrown in the garbage.

===POW camp===
Dengler was eventually brought to a prison camp near the village of Par Kung where he met other [[POWs]]. The other six prisoners were:
* [[Phisit Intharathat]] ([[Thailand|Thai]])
* Prasit Promsuwan (Thai)
* Prasit Thanee (Thai)
* Y.C. To (Chinese)
* [[Duane W. Martin]] (American)
* [[Eugene DeBruin]] (American)

Except for Martin, an Air Force helicopter pilot who had been shot down in North Vietnam nearly a year before, the other prisoners were civilians employed by [[Air America (airline)|Air America]], a civilian airline owned by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. The civilians had been in Pathet Lao hands for over two and a half years when Dengler joined them.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I had hoped to see other pilots. What I saw horrified me. The first one who came out was carrying his intestines around in his hands. One had no teeth - plagued by awful infections, he had begged the others to knock them out with a rock and a rusty nail in order to release pus from his gums".

"They had been there for two and a half years," said Dengler. "I looked at them and it was just awful. I realized that was how I would look in six months. I had to escape."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The day he arrived in the camp, Dengler advised the other prisoners that he intended to escape and invited them to join him. They advised that he wait until the monsoon season when there would be plenty of water. Shortly after Dengler arrived, the prisoners were moved to a new camp ten miles away at Hoi Het. After the move, a strong debate ensued among the prisoners with Dengler, Martin and Prasit arguing for escape which the other prisoners, particularly Phisit initially opposed.

As food began to run out, tension between the men grew: they were given just a single handful of rice to share while the guards would stalk deer, pulling the grass out of the animal's stomach for the prisoners to eat while they shared the meat. The prisoners' only "treats" were snakes they occasionally caught from the communal latrine or the rats that lived under their hut which they could spear with sharpened bamboo. At night the men were handcuffed together and shackled to wooden foot blocks. They suffered chronic dysentery and were made to lie in their excrement until morning.

After several months, one of the Thai prisoners overheard the guards talking about shooting them in the jungle and making it look like an escape attempt. They too, were starving and wanted to return to their villages. With that revelation, everyone agreed and a date to escape was set. Their plan was to take over the camp and signal a [[C-130|C-130 Hercules]] flare-ship that made nightly visits to the area. Dengler loosened logs under the hut that allowed the prisoners to squeeze through. The plan was for him to go out when the guards were eating and seize their weapons and pass them to [[Phisit Intharathat]] and Promsuwan while Martin and DeBruin procured others from other locations.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I planned to capture the guards at lunchtime, when they put down their rifles to get their food. There were two minutes and twenty seconds in the day when I could strike." In that time Dengler had to release all the men from their handcuffs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Escape===
On June 29, 1966 while the guards were eating, the group slipped out of their hand-cuffs and foot restraints and grabbed the guard's unattended weapons which included M1 rifles, Chinese automatic rifles, an American carbine and at least one sub-machine gun as well as an early version of the AK47 automatic rifle, which Dengler used during the escape from the POW camp. Dengler went out first followed by Martin. He went to the guard hut and seized an M1 for himself and passed the American carbine to Martin. The guards realized the prisoners had escaped and five of them rushed toward Dengler, who shot at least three with the AK47. Phisit killed another guard as he reached for his rifle. Two others ran off, presumably to get help, although at least one had been wounded. The seven prisoners split into three groups. DeBruin was originally supposed to go with Dengler and Martin but decided to go with To, who was recovering from a fever and unable to keep up. They intended to get over the nearest ridge and wait for rescue. Dengler and Martin went off by themselves with the intention of heading for the [[Mekong River]] to escape to Thailand, but they never got more than a few miles from the camp from which they had escaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/dieter-denglers-great-escape-from-laotian-pow-camp.htm | title=Dieter Dengler's Great Escape from Laotian POW Camp |date= July 12, 2010|publisher=HistoryNet, LLC. |accessdate=October 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Seven of us escaped," said Dengler. "I was the only one who came out alive."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the exception of Phisit, who was recaptured and later rescued by Laotian troops, none of the other prisoners were [[Missing in action|ever seen again]]. DeBruin was reportedly captured and placed in another camp, then disappeared in 1968.

===Rescue===
Escape proved to be hazardous. Soon, the two men's feet were white, mangled stumps from trekking through the dense jungle. They found the sole of an old tennis shoe, which they wore alternately, strapping it onto a foot with rattan for a few moments' respite. In this way they were able to make their way to a fast-flowing river.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It was the highway to freedom," said Dengler, "We knew it would flow into the Mekong River, which would take us over the border into Thailand and to safety."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The men built a raft and floated downstream on ferocious rapids, tying themselves to trees at night to stop themselves being washed away in the torrential water. By morning they would be covered in mud and hundreds of leeches. When they thought they were on their way to the Mekong, they discovered that they had gone around in a circle. They had spotted several villages but had not been detected. They set up camp in an abandoned village where they found shelter from the nearly incessant rain. They had brought rice with them and found other food, but were still on the verge of starvation. Their intent had been to signal a [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130]] but at first lacked the energy to build a fire using primitive methods of rubbing bamboo together. Dengler finally managed to locate [[carbine]] cartridges that Martin had thrown away and used their powder to enhance the tinder and got a fire going. That night they lit torches and waved them in the shape of an S and O when a C-130 came over. The airplane circled and dropped a couple of flares and they were overjoyed, believing they had been spotted. They woke up the next morning to find the landscape covered by fog and drizzle, but when it lifted, no rescue force appeared.

Martin, who was weak from starvation and was suffering from malaria, wanted to approach a nearby [[Akha people|Akha]] village to steal some food. Dengler knew it was not a good idea, but refused to let his friend go near the village alone. They saw a little boy playing with a dog and the child ran into the village calling out "American!" Within seconds a villager appeared and they knelt down on the trail in supplication, but the man swung his machete and struck Martin in the leg. With the next swipe, Duane's head came off. Dengler jumped to his feet and rushed toward the villager, who turned and ran into the village to get help.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I reached for the rubber sole from his foot, grabbed it and ran. From that moment on, all my motions became mechanical. I couldn't care less if I lived or died.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dengler recalls, it was a wild animal who gave him the mental strength to continue.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I was followed by this beautiful bear. He became like my pet dog and was the only friend I had."

These were his darkest hours. Little more than a walking skeleton after weeks on the run, he floated in and out of a hallucinatory state.

"I was just crawling along," he said. "Then I had a vision: these enormous doors opened up. Lots of horses came galloping out. They were not driven by death, but by angels. Death didn't want me." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Werner Herzog|title=Little Dieter wants to fly }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dengler managed to evade the searchers who went out after him and escaped back into the jungle. He returned to the abandoned village where the two had been spending their time and where he and Martin had signaled the C-130. That night when a C-130 flare-ship came, Dengler set fire to the huts and burned the village down. The C-130 crew spotted the fires and dropped flares, but even though the crew reported their sighting when they returned to [[Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base]], the fires were not recognized by intelligence as having been a signal from a survivor.

As it was, Deatrick describes it as "a million-in-one chance."&lt;ref name="Henderson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Henderson|title=Hero Found: The Greatest POW Escape of the Vietnam War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkbY0FblIsAC&amp;pg=PA260|accessdate=16 July 2012|date=29 June 2010|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-157136-7|pages=260–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dieter.jpg|thumb|175px|Photo taken of Dengler in the hospital after his rescue. At 5 feet nine inches (175 cm), Dengler weighed only 98 pounds (44.45 kilos)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Henderson|title=Hero Found: The Greatest POW Escape of the Vietnam War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkbY0FblIsAC&amp;pg=PA234|accessdate=22 October 2012|date=29 June 2010|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-157136-7|pages=234–}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
When a rescue force again failed to materialize, Dengler decided to find one of the parachutes from a flare for use as a possible signal. He found one on a bush and placed it in his rucksack. On July 20, 1966, after 23 days in the jungle, Dengler managed to signal an Air Force pilot with the parachute. A 2-ship flight of Air Force Skyraiders from the [[1st Special Operations Squadron|1st Air Commando Squadron]] happened to fly up the river where Dengler was. [[Eugene Peyton Deatrick]], the pilot of the lead plane and the squadron commander, spotted a flash of white while making a turn at the river's bend and came back and spotted a man waving something white. Deatrick and his wingman contacted rescue forces, but were told to ignore the sighting, as no airmen were known to be down in the area. Deatrick persisted and eventually managed to convince the command and control center to dispatch a rescue force.  Fearing that Dengler might be a [[Viet Cong]] soldier, the helicopter crew restrained him when he was brought aboard.

According to the documentary, ''[[Little Dieter Needs to Fly]]'', Dengler said one of the flight crew who was holding him down pulled out a half eaten snake from underneath Dengler's clothing and was so surprised he nearly fell out of the helicopter. The person who threw Dengler to the floor of the helicopter was Air Force Pararescue specialist Michael Leonard from [[Lawler, Iowa]]. Leonard stripped Dengler of his clothes, making sure he was not armed or in possession of a hand grenade. When questioned, Dengler told Leonard that he was a Navy lieutenant JG who had escaped from a North Vietnamese prisoner of war camp two months earlier. Deatrick radioed the rescue helicopter crew to see if they could identify the person they had just hoisted up from the jungle.  They reported that they had a man who claimed to be a downed Navy pilot who flew a Douglas A-1H Skyraider.

It wasn't until after he reached the hospital at Da Nang that Dengler's identity was confirmed. A conflict between the Air Force and the Navy developed over who should control his debriefing and recovery. In an apparent attempt to prevent the Air Force from embarrassing them in some way, the navy sent a team of SEALs into the hospital to literally steal Dengler. He was brought out of the hospital in a covered gurney and rushed to the air field, where he was placed aboard a navy carrier delivery transport Grumman C-2A from VR-21 and flown to the ''Ranger'' where a welcoming party had been prepared. At night, however, he was tormented by awful terrors, and had to be tied to his bed. In the end, his friends put him to sleep in a cockpit, surrounded by pillows. "It was the only place I felt safe," he said.&lt;ref name="arlingtoncemetery.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/ddengler.htm | title=Dieter Dengler  Lieutenant, United States Navy |date= January 1, 2007|publisher=Arlington National Cemetery Biography |accessdate=October 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dengler's deprivation from [[malnutrition]] and [[parasite]]s caused the Navy doctors to order that he be airlifted to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-496091/Tortured-razor-sharp-bamboo-fed-alive-ants-The-story-PoWs-incredible-escape-Vietnam.html | title=Tortured with razor-sharp bamboo and fed alive to ants: The story behind one PoW's incredible escape from Vietnam |date=November 23, 2007 |publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd |accessdate=October 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
[[File:Deatrick and Dengler 1968.jpg|right|thumb|Eugene Deatrick and Dieter Dengler, [[NAS Miramar]], 1968. (USN Photo)]]
Dengler recovered physically, but never put his ordeal behind him. As [[Werner Herzog]] described it in his documentary about Dengler, "Men are often haunted by things that happen to them in life, especially in war. Their lives come to be normal, but they are not."

He remained in the navy for a year, was promoted to [[Lieutenant#Lieutenant|Lieutenant]], and was trained to fly jets. When his military obligation was satisfied, he resigned from the Navy and applied for a position as an airline pilot with [[Trans World Airlines]]. He continued flying and survived four subsequent crashes as a civilian test pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Werner Herzog |title=Rescue Dawn |medium=DVD |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, during a time when he was furloughed from Trans World Airlines, Dengler returned to Laos and was greeted as a celebrity by the Pathet Lao. He was taken to the camp from which he had escaped and was surprised to discover that at one point he and Martin had been within a mile and a half of it. His fascination with airplanes and aviation continued for the remainder of his life. He continued flying almost up until his death.  He took advantage of an early-retirement offer as a pilot for TWA sometime prior to 1985, but continued flying his meticulously restored [[Cessna 195]], putting it on static display at numerous California air shows.  In 2000, Dengler was inducted into the [[Gathering of Eagles]] program and told the story of his escape to groups of young military officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.au.af.mil/au/goe/eagle_bios/2000/dengler_2000.asp Dengler Gathering of Eagles 2000 Biography] Retrieved June 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Dengler was diagnosed with [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]], an incurable neurological disorder; on February 7, 2001, he rolled his wheelchair from his house down to the driveway of a fire station and shot himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/07/30/DDRE1EJ3OJ.DTL Sense of History Drives Writer to Tell POW Tale] San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/ddengler.htm Non-official Arlington National Cemetery Information on Dengler] Retrieved January 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A Navy honor guard was present at the burial as well as a fly-over by Navy [[F-14 Tomcat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/photo_gallery/03-19-01.html Photo of F-14 Flyover at Dengler Funeral] Retrieved January 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Dengler was married three times: to Marina Adamich (1966&amp;nbsp;– March 1970), to Irene Lam (September 11, 1980&amp;nbsp;– April 3, 1984) and to Yukiko Dengler (1998 until his death February 7, 2001). Dengler is also survived by two sons, Rolf and Alexander Dengler, and three grandsons, Tayden, Crixus and Corbin Dengler.&lt;ref name="arlingtoncemetery.net"/&gt;

==In film and literature==
Dengler made an appearance as one of the contestants on the January 30, 1967 episode of the television game show ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''. His secret, as told to host [[Steve Allen]], was that he had escaped from a POW camp in Laos. Dengler said that his weight had dropped to 93 pounds by the time he was rescued. During this appearance, both of Dengler's hands were bandaged in large casts. He explained that he had recently cut his tendons by accidentally falling through a sheet of plate glass.

In early 1968, Dengler was a contestant on the nighttime edition of the comedy game show ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''.

Dengler appears in the 1988 documentary ''We Can Keep You Forever''&lt;ref&gt;Released on VHS videocassette&lt;/ref&gt; about the POW/MIA issue generally. The documentary was written and directed by Christopher Olgiati. Gerry DeBruin, brother of Eugene DeBruin, is also interviewed. Information in the documentary appears at greater length in the 1990 book ''The Bamboo Cage: The Full Story of the American Servicemen Still Missing in Vietnam'' by [[Nigel Cawthorne]].

Dengler was the subject of [[Werner Herzog]]'s 1997 [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[Little Dieter Needs to Fly]]''. Herzog went on to direct a dramatized version of the story, ''[[Rescue Dawn]]'', which stars [[Christian Bale]] as Dengler. The film was shown at festivals throughout the end of 2006 and received a limited theatrical release in the USA on July 4, 2007, before the general release later that month. The film was released as a DVD in November 2007.

The movie ''Rescue Dawn'' was subjected to severe criticism by members of the family of Eugene DeBruin and Phisit Intharathat, the other survivor of the group.&lt;ref name="rescuedawnthetruth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rescuedawnthetruth.com |title=Rescue Dawn: The Truth |publisher=Family, Friends of Gene DeBruin Critical of Herzog Film |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928045436/http://www.rescuedawnthetruth.com/ |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herzog acknowledged that DeBruin acted heroically during his imprisonment, refusing to leave while some sick prisoners remained, but Herzog claimed to be unaware of this fact until after the film had been completed. Herzog states that this narrative aspect probably would have been included had he learned it earlier. DeBruin family members, however, said that Herzog was uninterested in speaking with them prior to the completion of the movie.&lt;ref name="dvd feature"&gt;Herzog, Werner, ''The Making of a True Story'', documentary feature on the American [[DVD]] release of ''Rescue Dawn''&lt;/ref&gt;

Dengler documented his experience in the book ''Escape From Laos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dengler |first=Dieter |title=Escape from Laos |publisher=Presidio Press |year=1979 |isbn=0-89141-076-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bestselling author [[Bruce Henderson (author)|Bruce Henderson]], who was serving on the same aircraft carrier as Dengler at the time he was shot down, tells Dengler's life story in a 2010 nonfiction book, ''[[Hero Found: The Greatest POW Escape of the Vietnam War]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Henderson |first=Bruce B. |year=2010 |title=Hero Found: The Greatest POW Escape of the Vietnam War |location=New York |publisher=Harper |isbn=978-0-06-157136-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''[[independence referendum]]''' was held in [[Estonia]] on 3 March 1991,&lt;ref name=DN&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p574 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside a similar referendum in [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvia]] [[Latvian independence and democracy referendum, 1991|the same month]]. It was approved by 78.4% of voters with an 82.9% turnout. Independence was restored by the Estonian Supreme Council on the night of 20 August.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p567&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Diesel-smoke.jpg|thumb|[[Air pollution]] from [[motor vehicle]]s is an example of a negative externality. The [[Air pollution#Health effects|costs of the air pollution for the rest of society]] is not compensated for by either the producers or users of motorized transport.]]

In [[economics]], an '''externality''' is the cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=James|author2=Wm. Craig Stubblebine|title=Externality|journal=Economica|date=November 1962|volume=29|issue=116|pages=371–84|doi=10.2307/2551386}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When there is no externality, [[allocative efficiency]] is achieved; however, this rarely happens in the free market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palmer |first=Stephen |title=Definitions of efficiency |journal=British Medical Journal |date=April 1999 |volume=318 |issue=7191 |page=1136 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1115526/}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=November 2018}}{{better source|date=November 2018}} &lt;!--[Citation not compelling, new ones needed]--&gt;. Economists often urge governments to adopt policies that will "internalize" an externality, so that costs and benefits will affect mainly parties who choose to incur them.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, William. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uhBkp5rmrXgC&amp;pg=PA80 Environmental Economics for Tree Huggers and Other Skeptics]'', p. 80 (Island Press 2012): "Economists often say that externalities need to be 'internalized,' meaning that some action needs to be taken to correct this kind of market failure."&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, manufacturing activities that cause [[air pollution]] impose health and clean-up costs on the whole society, whereas the neighbors of individuals who choose to [[Fireproofing|fire-proof]] their homes may benefit from a reduced risk of a fire spreading to their own houses. If external costs exist, such as [[pollution]], the producer may choose to produce more of the product than would be produced if the producer were required to pay all associated environmental costs. Because responsibility or consequence for self-directed action lies partly outside the self, an element of [[externalization]] is involved. If there are external benefits, such as in [[public safety]], less of the good may be produced than would be the case if the producer were to receive payment for the external benefits to others.  For the purpose of these statements, overall cost and benefit to society is defined as the sum of the imputed monetary value of benefits and costs to all parties involved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Jacques Laffont|J.J. Laffont]] (2008). "externalities," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Ed. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000200&amp;q=externality&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=9 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth J. Arrow]] (1969).

==History of the concept==
Two British economists are credited with having initiated the formal study of externalities, or "spillover effects": [[Henry Sidgwick]] (1838–1900) is credited with first articulating, and [[Arthur C. Pigou]] (1877–1959)  is credited with formalizing the concept of externalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://glencoe.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0025694212/student_view0/chapter16/origin_of_the_idea.html |title=Economics (McConnell), 18th Edition Chapter 16: Public Goods, Externalities, and Information Asymmetries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
A negative externality is any difference between the private cost of an action or decision to an economic agent and the social cost. In simple terms, a negative externality is anything that causes an indirect cost to individuals. An example is the toxic gases that are released from industries or mines, these gases cause harm to individuals within the surrounding area and have to bear a cost (indirect cost) to get rid of that harm.  Conversely, a positive externality is any difference between the private benefit of an action or decision to an economic agent and the social benefit.

===Formal definition===
Suppose that there are &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; different possible allocations and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; different agents, where &lt;math&gt;K,N &lt; \infty &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N \geq 2&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that each agent has a type &lt;math&gt; \theta_i \sim F_i[0,1] &lt;/math&gt; and that each agent gets payoff &lt;math&gt; v_i(\theta_i, k) + t_i &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; t_i &lt;/math&gt; is the transfer paid by the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th agent. A map &lt;math&gt;f=(\kappa,t_1,\ldots,t_N) &lt;/math&gt; is a ''social choice function'' if

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^N t_i(\theta) \leq 0&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt; \theta \in [0,1]^N.&lt;/math&gt; An allocation &lt;math&gt; \kappa \colon [0,1]^N \to K&lt;/math&gt; is ''ex-post efficient'' if

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^N v_i(\theta_i, \kappa(\theta)) \geq \sum_{i=1}^N v_i(\theta_i, k)&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;\theta=(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_N) \in [0,1]^N&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;k \in K.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt; \kappa^* &lt;/math&gt; denote an ex-post efficient allocation and let &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\kappa}_i&lt;/math&gt; denote an ex-post efficient allocation without agent &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. Then the ''externality'' imposed by agent &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; on the other agents is

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{j \neq i} v_j (\theta_j, \tilde{\kappa}_i (\theta_{-i})) - \sum_{j \neq i} v_j (\theta_j, \kappa^* (\theta)), &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Microeconomic Theory|last=Mas-Colell|first=Andreu|publisher=Oxford|year=1995|isbn=0-19-507340-1|location=|page=878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta_{-i}&lt;/math&gt; is the type vector &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; without its &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th component. Intuitively, the first term is the hypothetical total payoff for all agents &lt;math&gt;j \neq i&lt;/math&gt; given that agent &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; does not exist, and the second (subtracted) term is the actual total payoff for all agents &lt;math&gt;j \neq i&lt;/math&gt; given that agent &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; does exist.

{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}

Voluntary exchange is by definition mutually beneficial to both business parties involved because the parties would not agree to undertake it if either thought it detrimental to their interests. However, a transaction can cause effects on third parties without their knowledge or consent. From the perspective of those affected, these effects may be negative (pollution from a nearby factory), or positive (honey bees kept for honey that also pollinate neighboring crops). Neoclassical [[welfare economics]] asserts that, under plausible conditions, the existence of externalities will result in outcomes that are not socially optimal. Those who suffer from external costs do so involuntarily, whereas those who enjoy external benefits do so at no cost.

A voluntary exchange may reduce societal welfare if external costs exist. The person who is affected by the negative externalities in the case of air pollution will see it as lowered [[utility]]: either subjective displeasure or potentially explicit costs, such as higher medical expenses. The externality may even be seen as a [[trespass]] on their [[lung]]s, violating their property rights. Thus, an external cost may pose an [[ethical]] or [[political]] problem. Negative externalities are [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto inefficient]], and since Pareto efficiency underpins the justification for private property, they undermine the whole idea of a market economy. For these reasons, negative externalities are more problematic than positive externalities.

Positive externalities, while Pareto efficient, are still market failures that undermine [[allocative efficiency]] because less of the good will be produced than would be optimal for society as a whole in a theoretical model with no government. If those externalities were internalized, the producer would be incentivized to produce more. Goods with positive externalities include education (believed to increase societal productivity and well-being, though some benefits are internalized in the form of higher wages), public health initiatives (which may reduce the health risks and costs for third parties for such things as transmittable diseases) and law enforcement.

Positive externalities are often associated with the [[free rider problem]]. For example, individuals who are vaccinated reduce the risk of contracting the relevant disease for all others around them, and at high levels of vaccination, society may receive large health and welfare benefits ([[herd immunity]]); but any one individual can refuse vaccination, still avoiding the disease by "free riding" on the costs borne by others.

There are a number of theoretical means of improving overall social utility when negative externalities are involved. The market-driven approach to correcting externalities is to "''internalize''" third party costs and benefits, for example, by requiring a polluter to repair any damage caused. But in many cases, internalizing costs or benefits is not feasible, especially if the true monetary values cannot be determined.

[[Laissez-faire]] economists such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Milton Friedman]] sometimes refer to externalities as "neighborhood effects" or "spillovers", although externalities are not necessarily minor or localized. Similarly, [[Ludwig von Mises]] argues that externalities arise from lack of "clear personal property definition."

===Negative===
[[File:Empire State Building Night.jpg|thumb|[[Light pollution]] is an example of an externality because the consumption of street lighting has an effect on bystanders that is not compensated for by the consumers of the lighting.]]

A '''negative externality''' (also called "external cost" or "external diseconomy") is an economic activity that imposes a negative effect on an unrelated third party. It can arise either during the production or the consumption of a good or service.&lt;ref name="externality"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microeconomics – Externalities |url=http://principles-of-economics-and-business.blogspot.com/2014/10/microeconomics-externalities.html|accessdate=2014-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollution is termed an externality because it imposes costs on people who are "external" to the producer and consumer of the polluting product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economics and the Environment|last=Goodstein|first=Eban|publisher=Wiley|year=|isbn=9781118539729|location=|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Commoner]] commented on the costs of externalities:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Clearly, we have compiled a record of serious failures in recent technological encounters with the environment. In each case, the new technology was brought into use before the ultimate hazards were known. We have been quick to reap the benefits and slow to comprehend the costs.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Commoner "Frail Reeds in a Harsh World". New York: The American Museum of Natural History. ''Natural History''. Journal of the American Museum of Natural History'', Vol. LXXVIII No. 2, February, 1969, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Many negative externalities are related to the environmental consequences of production and use.  The article on [[environmental economics]] also addresses externalities and how they may be addressed in the context of environmental issues.

Examples for '''negative production externalities''' include:

* The depletion of the stock of fish in the ocean due to [[overfishing]]. This is an example of a [[Common Property Resource|common property resource]], which is vulnerable to the ''[[Tragedy of the commons]]'' in the absence of appropriate environmental governance.
* In the United States, the cost of storing [[nuclear waste]] from [[nuclear plant]]s for more than 1,000 years (over 100,000 for some types of nuclear waste) is, in principle, included in the cost of the electricity the plant produces in the form of a fee paid to the government and held in the [[Nuclear Waste Policy Act|nuclear waste superfund]], although much of that fund was spent on Yucca Mountain without producing a solution.  Conversely, the costs of managing the long-term risks of disposal of chemicals, which may remain hazardous on similar time scales, is not commonly internalized in prices.  The USEPA regulates chemicals for periods ranging from 100 years to a maximum of 10,000 years.

Examples of '''negative consumption externalities''' include:
[[File:Negative_Consumption_Externality.png|thumb|Negative Consumption Externality]]
* [[Noise pollution]] Sleep deprivation due to a neighbor listening to loud music late at night.
* [[Antibiotic resistance]], caused by increased usage of antibiotics. Individuals do not consider this efficacy cost when making usage decisions.  Government policies proposed to preserve future antibiotic effectiveness include educational campaigns, regulation, [[Pigouvian taxes]], and patents.
* [[Passive smoking]] Shared costs of declining health and vitality caused by smoking and/or alcohol abuse. Here, the "cost" is that of providing minimum social welfare. Economists more frequently attribute this problem to the category of [[moral hazard]]s, the prospect that parties insulated from risk may behave differently from the way they would if they were fully exposed to the risk. For example, individuals with insurance against automobile theft may be less vigilant about locking their cars, because the negative consequences of automobile theft are (partially) borne by the insurance company.
* [[Traffic congestion]] When more people use public roads, road users experience (congestion costs) such as more waiting in traffic and longer trip times. Increased road users also increase the likelihood of road accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Small | first = Kenneth A. | last2 = José A.

*  [[Price increases]] Consumption by one consumer of goods in addition to their existing supply causes prices to rise and therefore makes other consumers worse off, perhaps by preventing, reducing or delaying their consumption. These effects are sometimes called "[[pecuniary externalities]]" and are distinguished from "real externalities" or "technological externalities". Pecuniary externalities appear to be externalities, but occur within the market mechanism and are not considered to be a source of [[market failure]] or inefficiency, although they may still result in substantial harm to others.&lt;ref name="LiebowitzMargolis1994"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Liebowitz|first1=S.J.|authorlink1=Stnaley J.

*  [[Second hand smoke|Second-hand smoke]] from cigarettes or marijuana. As cannabis legalization is considered, one potential negative consumption externality associated with legalization policy could be the second-hand smoke that could harm other's lungs, and/or second-hand highs.

===Positive===
A positive externality (also called "external benefit" or "external economy" or "beneficial externality") is the positive effect an activity imposes on an unrelated third party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Varian |first=H.R.|date=2010|title=Intermediate microeconomics: a modern approach |location=New York, NY |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to a negative externality, it can arise either on the production side, or on the consumption side.&lt;ref name="externality" /&gt;
[[File:Positive_Production_Externality.png|thumb|Positive Production Externality]]

Examples of '''positive production externalities''' include:
* A [[beekeeper]] who keeps the [[bees]] for their [[honey]]. A side effect or externality associated with such activity is the [[pollination]] of surrounding crops by the bees. The value generated by the pollination may be more important than the value of the harvested honey.
* The construction and operation of an airport. This will benefit local businesses, because of the increased accessibility.
* An industrial company providing first aid classes for employees to increase on the [[job safety]]. This may also save lives outside the factory.
* A foreign firm that demonstrates up-to-date technologies to local firms and improves their productivity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/wdevel/v42y2013icp1-15.html Determinants of Horizontal Spillovers from FDI: Evidence from a Large Meta-Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pos_consumer_externality.png|thumb|Positive Consumption Externality]]
Examples of '''positive consumption externalities''' include:
* An individual who maintains an attractive house may confer benefits to neighbors in the form of increased [[real estate appraisal|market values]] for their properties.
* An individual receiving a vaccination for a [[infection|communicable disease]] not only decreases the likelihood of the individual's own infection, but also decreases the likelihood of others becoming infected through contact with the individual. (See ''[[herd immunity]]'')
* Increased [[education]] of individuals, as this can lead to broader society benefits in the form of greater economic [[productivity]], a lower [[employment-to-population ratio|unemployment rate]], greater household mobility and higher rates of [[participation (decision making)|political participation]].&lt;ref&gt;Weisbrod, Burton , 1962. External Benefits of Public Education, Princeton University&lt;/ref&gt;
* An individual buying a product that is interconnected in a network (e.g., a [[smartphone]]). This will increase the usefulness of such phones to other people who have a video cellphone. When each new user of a product increases the value of the same product owned by others, the phenomenon is called a network externality or a [[network effect]].  Network externalities often have "[[:wikt:tipping point|tipping points]]" where, suddenly, the product reaches general acceptance and near-universal usage.
* In an area that does not have a [[public sector|public]] [[fire department]], homeowners who purchase [[private sector|private]] fire protection services provide a positive externality to neighboring properties, which are less at risk of the protected neighbor's fire spreading to their (unprotected) house.

The existence or management of externalities may give rise to political or legal conflicts.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Collective solutions or [[public policy|public policies]] are implemented to [[regulation|regulate]] activities with positive or negative externalities.

===Positional===
A position externality "occurs when new purchases alter the relevant context within which an existing positional good is evaluated."&lt;ref name="FrankPositional"&gt;[[Robert H. Frank]], "[http://www.brookings.edu/gs/events/externalities.pdf Are Positional Externalities Different from Other Externalities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221184110/http://www.brookings.edu/gs/events/externalities.pdf |date=2012-12-21 }}? " (draft for presentation for ''Why Inequality Matters: Lessons for Policy from the Economics of Happiness'', [[Brookings Institution]], [[Washington, D.C.]], June 4–5, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert H. Frank]] gives the following example:
:if some job candidates begin wearing expensive custom-tailored suits, a side effect of their action is that other candidates become less likely to make favorable impressions on interviewers. From any individual job seeker's point of view, the best response might be to match the higher expenditures of others, lest her chances of landing the job fall.  But this outcome may be inefficient since when all spend more, each candidate's probability of success remains unchanged.  All may agree that some form of collective restraint on expenditure would be useful."&lt;ref name="FrankPositional"/&gt;

Frank notes that treating positional externalities like other externalities might lead to "intrusive economic and social regulation."&lt;ref name="FrankPositional"/&gt; He argues, however, that less intrusive and more efficient means of "limiting the costs of [[expenditure cascades]]"—i.e., the hypothesized increase in spending of middle-income families beyond their means "because of indirect effects associated with increased spending by top earners"—exist; one such method is the [[personal income tax]].&lt;ref name="FrankPositional"/&gt;

===Inframarginal===
Inframarginal externalities are externalities in which there is no benefit or loss to the marginal consumer.  In other words, people neither gain nor lose anything at the margin, but benefits and costs do exist for those consumers within the given inframarginal range.

===Technological===
Technological externalities directly affect a firm's production and therefore, indirectly influence an individual's consumption; and the overall impact of society.

==Supply and demand diagram==
The usual economic analysis of externalities can be illustrated using a standard [[supply and demand]] diagram if the externality can be valued in terms of [[money]]. An extra supply or demand curve is added, as in the diagrams below. One of the curves is the ''private cost'' that consumers pay as individuals for additional quantities of the good, which in competitive markets, is the marginal private cost. The other curve is the ''true'' cost that society as a whole pays for production and consumption of increased production the good, or the marginal [[social cost]]. Similarly, there might be two curves for the demand or benefit of the good. The social demand curve would reflect the benefit to society as a whole, while the normal demand curve reflects the benefit to consumers as individuals and is reflected as [[effective demand]] in the market.

What curve is added depends on the type of externality that is described, but not whether it is positive or negative. Whenever an externality arises on the production side, there will be two supply curves (private and social cost). However, if the externality arises on the consumption side, there will be two demand curves instead (private and social benefit). This distinction is essential when it comes to resolving inefficiencies that are caused by externalities.

===External costs===
[[File:Negative externality.svg|384px|right|thumb|Demand curve with external costs; if social costs are not accounted for price is too low to cover all costs and hence quantity produced is unnecessarily high (because the producers of the good and their customers are essentially underpaying the total, real [[factors of production]].)]]
The graph shows the effects of a negative externality. For example, the [[steel industry]] is assumed to be selling in a competitive market – before pollution-control laws were imposed and enforced (e.g. under [[laissez-faire]]). The marginal private cost is less than the marginal social or public cost by the amount of the external cost, i.e., the cost of [[air pollution]] and [[water pollution]]. This is represented by the vertical distance between the two supply curves. It is assumed that there are no external benefits, so that social benefit ''equals'' individual benefit.

If the consumers only take into account their own private cost, they will end up at price '''P&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''' and quantity '''Q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''', instead of the more efficient price '''P&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''' and quantity '''Q&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'''. These latter reflect the idea that the marginal social benefit should equal the marginal social cost, that is that production should be increased ''only'' as long as the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. The result is that a [[free market]] is ''[[inefficiency|inefficient]]'' since at the quantity '''Q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''', the social benefit is less than the social cost, so society as a whole would be better off if the goods between '''Q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''Q&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''' had not been produced. The problem is that people are buying and consuming ''too much'' steel.

This discussion implies that negative externalities (such as pollution) are ''more than'' merely an ethical problem. The problem is one of the disjunctures between marginal private and social costs that are not solved by the [[free market]]. It is a problem of societal communication and coordination to balance costs and benefits. This also implies that pollution is not something solved by competitive markets. Some ''collective'' solution is needed, such as a court system to allow parties affected by the pollution to be compensated, government intervention banning or discouraging pollution, or economic incentives such as [[green tax]]es.

===External benefits===
[[File:Positive externality.svg|384px|right|thumb|Supply curve with external benefits; when the market does not account for the additional social benefits of a good both the price for the good and the quantity produced are lower than the market could bear.]]
The graph shows the effects of a positive or beneficial externality. For example, the industry supplying smallpox vaccinations is assumed to be selling in a competitive market.  The marginal private benefit of getting the vaccination is less than the marginal social or public benefit by the amount of the external benefit (for example, society as a whole is increasingly protected from smallpox by each vaccination, including those who refuse to participate). This marginal external benefit of getting a smallpox shot is represented by the vertical distance between the two demand curves. Assume there are no external costs, so that social cost ''equals'' individual cost.

If consumers only take into account their own private benefits from getting vaccinations, the market will end up at price '''P&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''' and quantity '''Q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''' as before, instead of the more efficient price '''P&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''' and quantity '''Q&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'''. This latter again reflect the idea that the marginal social benefit should equal the marginal social cost, i.e., that production should be increased as long as the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. The result in an [[free market|unfettered market]] is ''[[inefficiency|inefficient]]'' since at the quantity '''Q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''', the social benefit is greater than the societal cost, so society as a whole would be better off if more goods had been produced. The problem is that people are buying ''too few'' vaccinations.

The issue of external benefits is related to that of [[public goods]], which are goods where it is difficult if not impossible to exclude people from benefits. The production of a public good has beneficial externalities for all, or almost all, of the public. As with external costs, there is a problem here of societal communication and coordination to balance benefits and costs. This also implies that vaccination is not something solved by competitive markets. The government may have to step in with a collective solution, such as subsidizing or legally requiring vaccine use. If the government does this, the good is called a [[merit good]]. Examples include policies to accelerate the introduction of [[electric vehicles]]&lt;ref name="BuekersEV"&gt;{{cite journal

==Causes==
Externalities often arise from poorly defined [[property right]]s. While property rights to some things, such as objects, land, and money can be easily defined and protected, air, water, and wild animals often flow freely across personal and political borders, making it much more difficult to assign ownership. This incentivizes agents to consume them without paying the full cost, leading to negative externalities. Positive externalities similarly accrue from poorly defined property rights. For example, a person who gets a flu vaccination cannot own part of the [[herd immunity]] this confers on society, so they may choose not to be vaccinated.

==Possible solutions==
===Solutions in non-market economies===
*Many externalities arise from lack of property rights. Consequently, introducing property rights will internalize many costs and benefits.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}
*In a gift economy, people are expected to consume what they are given. If they consume a gift which they value less than somebody else, that other person who cannot consume it is harmed, an externality. A market system will reduce this kind of externality because the person who values it less is more likely to trade it away and the person who values it more is more likely to trade for it.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Solutions in market economies===
There is no market solution that will internalize all externalities{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}. Consequently, elements of the moral economy must be used, including social norms, law, leadership, and hierarchy. "All of these structures are grounded in trust, which when supplemented with sanctions, can be used to generate complex institutional forms that can sustain outcomes that are not strategic equilibria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heath |first1=Joseph |title=Normative economics |url=http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/%7Ejheath/text/table.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several general types of solutions to the problem of externalities, including both public- and private-sector resolutions:
* [[Corporations]] or [[partnerships]] will allow confidential sharing of information among members, reducing the positive externalities that would occur if the information were shared in an economy consisting only of individuals. 
* [[Pigovian tax]]es or [[subsidies]] intended to redress economic injustices or imbalances.
* [[Regulation]] to limit activity that might cause negative externalities
* [[Government provision]] of services with positive externalities
* [[Lawsuit]]s to compensate affected parties for negative externalities
* [[Mediation]] or negotiation between those affected by externalities and those causing them

A Pigovian tax (also called Pigouvian tax, after economist Arthur C. Pigou) is a tax imposed that is equal in value to the negative externality. The result is that the market outcome would be reduced to the efficient amount. A side effect is that revenue is raised for the government, reducing the amount of [[Distortion (economics)|distortionary]] taxes that the government must impose elsewhere.  Governments justify the use of Pigovian taxes saying that these taxes help the market reach an efficient outcome because this tax bridges the gap between marginal social costs and marginal private costs.&lt;ref&gt;Barthold, Thomas A. (1994). "Issues in the Design of Excise Tax." ''Journal of Economic Perspectives.'' 133–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some arguments against Pigovian taxes say that the tax does not account for all the transfers and regulations involved with an externality. In other words, the tax only considers the amount of externality produced.&lt;ref&gt;Nye, John (2008). "The Pigou Problem." ''The Cato Institute.'' 32–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Another argument against the tax is that it does not take private property into consideration.  Under the Pigovian system, one firm, for example, can be taxed more than another firm, even though the other firm is actually producing greater amounts of the negative externality.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, A.H. and Yundle, Bruce. (2005). "The End of the Externality Revolution." [https://mises.org/journals/scholar/barnett.pdf PDF.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

However, the most common type of solution is a tacit agreement through the political process.  Governments are elected to represent citizens and to strike political compromises between various interests.  Normally governments pass laws and regulations to address pollution and other types of environmental harm.  These laws and regulations can take the form of "command and control" regulation (such as setting standards, targets, or [[process requirements]]), or [[environmental pricing reform]] (such as [[ecotax]]es or other [[Pigovian tax]]es, [[pollution market|tradable pollution permits]] or the creation of markets for ecological services). The second type of resolution is a purely private agreement between the parties involved.

Government intervention might not always be needed. Traditional ways of life may have evolved as ways to deal with external costs and benefits. Alternatively, democratically run communities can agree to deal with these costs and benefits in an amicable way. Externalities can sometimes be resolved by agreement between the parties involved. This resolution may even come about because of the threat of government action.

The private-sector may sometimes be able to drive society to the socially optimal resolution. [[Ronald Coase]] argued that an efficient outcome can sometimes be reached without government intervention. Some take this argument further, and make the political claim that government should restrict its role to facilitating bargaining among the affected groups or individuals and to enforcing any contracts that result.

This result, often known as the [[Coase theorem]], requires that
* Property rights be well-defined
* People act rationally
* [[Transaction costs]] be minimal (costless bargaining)
* [[Complete information]]
If all of these conditions apply, the private parties can bargain to solve the problem of externalities. The second part of the [[Coase theorem]] asserts that, when these conditions hold, whoever holds the property rights, a [[Pareto efficient]] outcome will be reached through bargaining.

This theorem would not apply to the steel industry case discussed above. For example, with a steel factory that trespasses on the lungs of a large number of individuals with pollution, it is difficult if not impossible for any one person to negotiate with the producer, and there are large transaction costs. Hence the most common approach may be to regulate the firm (by imposing limits on the amount of pollution considered "acceptable") while paying for the regulation and enforcement with [[taxes]]. The case of the vaccinations would also not satisfy the requirements of the Coase theorem. Since the potential external beneficiaries of vaccination are the people themselves, the people would have to self-organize to pay each other to be vaccinated. But such an organization that involves the entire populace would be indistinguishable from government action.

In some cases, the Coase theorem is relevant. For example, if a [[logging|logger]] is planning to clear-cut a [[forest]] in a way that has a negative impact on a nearby [[resort]], the resort-owner and the logger could, in theory, get together to agree to a deal. For example, the resort-owner could pay the logger not to clear-cut – or could buy the forest. The most problematic situation, from Coase's perspective, occurs when the forest literally does not belong to anyone, or in any example in which there are not well-defined and enforceable property rights; the question of "who" owns the forest is not important, as any specific owner will have an interest in coming to an agreement with the resort owner (if such an agreement is mutually beneficial).

However, the Coase theorem is difficult to implement because Coase does not offer a negotiation method.&lt;ref&gt;Varian, Hal (1994). "A Solution to the Problem of Externalities When Agents Are Well Informed." ''The [[American Economic Review]].'' Vol. 84 No. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Coasian solutions are unlikely to be reached due to the possibility of running into the [[assignment problem]], the [[holdout problem]], the [[free-rider problem]], and/or [[transaction cost]]s. Additionally, firms could potentially bribe each other since there is little to no government interaction under the Coase theorem.&lt;ref&gt;Marney, G.A. (1971). "The ‘Coase Theorem:' A Reexamination." ''Quarterly Journal of Economics.''Vol. 85 No. 4. 718–23.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if one oil firm has a high pollution rate and its neighboring firm is bothered by the pollution, then the latter firm may move depending on incentives. Thus, if the oil firm were to bribe the second firm, the first oil firm would suffer no negative consequences because the government would not know about the bribing.

In a dynamic setup, Rosenkranz and Schmitz (2007) have shown that the impossibility to rule out Coasean bargaining tomorrow may actually justify Pigouvian intervention today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenkranz|first=Stephanie|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=2007|title=Can Coasean Bargaining Justify Pigouvian Taxation?|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0335.2006.00556.x|journal=Economica|language=en|volume=74|issue=296|pages=573–585|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.2006.00556.x|issn=0013-0427|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To see this, note that unrestrained bargaining in the future may lead to an underinvestment problem (the so-called [[hold-up problem]]). Specifically, when investments are relationship-specific and non-contractible, then insufficient investments will be made when it is anticipated that parts of the investments’ returns will go to the trading partner in future negotiations (see Hart and Moore, 1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hart|first=Oliver|last2=Moore|first2=John|date=1988|title=Incomplete Contracts and Renegotiation|jstor=1912698|journal=Econometrica|volume=56|issue=4|pages=755–785|doi=10.2307/1912698}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Pigouvian taxation can be welfare-improving precisely because Coasean bargaining will take place in the future. Antràs and Staiger (2012) make a related point in the context of international trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Antràs|first=Pol|last2=Staiger|first2=Robert W|date=2012|title=Offshoring and the Role of Trade Agreements|url=http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/aer.102.7.3140|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=102|issue=7|pages=3140–3183|doi=10.1257/aer.102.7.3140|issn=0002-8282|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Ecological economics]] criticizes the concept of externality because there is not enough system thinking and integration of different sciences in the concept.
Ecological economics is founded upon the view that the neoclassical economics (NCE) assumption that environmental and community costs and benefits are mutually cancelling "externalities" is not warranted. [[Joan Martinez Alier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Costanza|first=Robert|title=Getting Down to Earth: Practical Applications of Ecological Economics|year=1996|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=1559635037|author2=Segura,Olman |author3=Olsen, Juan Martinez-Alier }}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance shows that the bulk of consumers are automatically excluded from having an impact upon the prices of commodities, as these consumers are future generations who have not been born yet.  The assumptions behind future discounting, which assume that future goods will be cheaper than present goods, has been criticized by Fred Pearce&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, Fred "Blueprint for a Greener Economy"&lt;/ref&gt; and by the recent [[Stern Report]] (although the Stern report itself does employ discounting and has been criticized for this and other reasons by ecological economists such as Clive Spash).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clivespash.org/EE2007_SpashonStern.pdf |title=Spash, C. L. (2007) The economics of climate change impacts à la Stern: Novel and nuanced or rhetorically restricted? Ecological Economics 63(4): 706–13 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202105133/http://www.clivespash.org/EE2007_SpashonStern.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning these externalities, some like the eco-businessman [[Paul Hawken]] argue an orthodox economic line that the only reason why goods produced unsustainably are usually cheaper than goods produced sustainably is due to a hidden subsidy, paid by the non-monetized human environment, community or future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul (1994) "The Ecology of Commerce" (Collins)&lt;/ref&gt;  These arguments are developed further by Hawken, Amory and Hunter Lovins to promote their vision of an environmental capitalist utopia in ''[[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul; Amory and Hunter Lovins (2000) "Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution" (Back Bay Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, ecological economists, like Joan Martinez-Alier, appeal to a different line of reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Alier, Joan (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4JIzg4PUotcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Environmentalism of the Poor: A Study of Ecological Conflicts and Valuation]. Cheltenham, Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than assuming some (new) form of capitalism is the best way forward, an older ecological economic critique questions the very idea of internalizing externalities as providing some corrective to the current system. The work by [[Karl William Kapp]]&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Sebastian (2017) The Social Costs of Neoliberalism: Essays on the Economics of K. William Kapp. Nottingham: Spokesman&lt;/ref&gt;  explains why the concept of "externality" is a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl William (1963) The Social Costs of Business Enterprise. Bombay/London, Asia Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the modern business enterprise operates on the basis of shifting costs onto others as normal practice to make profits.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl William (1971) Social costs, neo-classical economics and environmental planning. The Social Costs of Business Enterprise, 3rd edition. K. W. Kapp. Nottingham, Spokesman: 305–18&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Eisenstein]] has argued that this method of privatising profits while socialising the costs through externalities, passing the costs to the community, to the natural environment or to future generations is inherently destructive&lt;ref&gt;Einsentein, Charles (2011), "Sacred Economics: Money, Gift and Society in an Age in Transition" (Evolver Editions)&lt;/ref&gt; As social ecological economist Clive Spash has noted, externality theory fallaciously assumes environmental and social problems are minor aberrations in an otherwise perfectly functioning efficient economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Spash, Clive L. |date= 16 July 2010 |title= The brave new world of carbon trading |journal= New Political Economy |volume= 15 |pages=169–95 |publisher= Taylor and Francis Online |issue= 2 |doi= 10.1080/13563460903556049 |url= http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/19114/1/MPRA_paper_19114.pdf }} Copy also available at {{cite web|url=http://www.clivespash.org/2010_Spash_Brave_New_World_NPE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510185658/http://clivespash.org/2010_Spash_Brave_New_World_NPE.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Internalizing the odd externality does nothing to address the structural systemic problem and fails to recognize the all pervasive nature of these supposed 'externalities'.This is precisely why heterodox economists argue for a heterodox theory of social costs to effectively prevent the problem through the precautionary principle.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Sebastian (ed) (2015) The Heterodox Theory of Social Costs - by K. William Kapp. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Feedback]]-controlled electromigration''' (FCE) is an experimental technique to investigate the phenomenon known as [[electromigration]]. By controlling the voltage applied as the [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] varies it is possible to keep the [[voltage]] at a critical level for [[electromigration]].

==Theory==
FCE has been shown to be reversible, demonstrating the fact that the electrons are moving rather than [[thermomigration]] or [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]. The migration occurs due to the [[Ion wind|electronic wind force]] experienced by the metallic [[adatom]].&lt;ref name=Ishida1&gt;{{cite journal | author = H.Ishida | title = Driving force for adatom electromigration within mixed Cu/Al overlayers on Al(111) | journal = Phys.

Strachan | title =Clean Electromigrated Nanogaps Imaged by Transmission Electron Microscopy | journal = Nano Lett | volume = 6 | year = 2006 | url = http://pubs.acs.org/wls/journals/query/citationFindResults.html?op=findCitation&amp;cit_qjrn=nalefd&amp;vol=6&amp;spn=441&amp;mscid=&amp;submit.x=24&amp;submit.y=9&amp;submit=FIND |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to [[Electromigrated Nanogaps]].

==Uses==
FCE is often used in forming nanogaps in metallic bridges.

==Problems==
[[Thermal runaway]] can occur when the neck is narrower than about 20&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=Mahadevan1&gt;{{cite journal | author = M.Mahadevan and R.m.

The '''Free Culture Forum''' (FCForum) is an international encounter of civic society actors on [[free culture movement|free culture]], [[digital rights]] and access to knowledge. It has been taking place in [[Barcelona]] every year since 2009. It takes place jointly with the [[Oxcars|oXcars]], a free culture festival.

== What is the FCForum ==

The FCForum is a major international meeting of the [http://fcforum.net/#signatories most relevant organisations and individuals] working on the international scene, who are engaged in reflecting on the social and economic challenges of the dissemination of culture and knowledge in the [[digital age]].

==FCForum 2009==
The main objectives of the Free Culture Forum 2009 (from October 30 to November 1) were, on the one hand, building networks to optimise the efforts of the different groups and setting common demands against the proposals from industry and governments in their eagerness to control culture and information; and on the other hand reinforcing the self-organisation of tools and infrastructures to support free culture.&lt;ref name="BoinBoing"&gt;[http://boingboing.net/2009/09/18/free-culture-forum-b.html Free Culture Forum Barcelona, Oct 29-Nov 1], by Cory Doctorow.&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of the Forum was organised by eXgae (now [[Xnet]]), [[Simona Levi]], [[Mayo Fuster Morell]], [http://www.networked-politics.info Networked politics] and the [[Free Knowledge Institute]]. The FCForum 2009 produced the [http://fcforum.net/charter_extended Charter for Innovation, Creativity and Access to Knowledge]. The Charter has been disseminated and implemented worldwide, including the [https://events.ccc.de/congress/2009/wiki/Main_Page 26th Chaos Communication Congress] in Berlin&lt;ref name="26C3"&gt;[https://events.ccc.de/congress/2009/wiki/Charter_for_Innovation,_Creativity_and_Access_to_Knowledge Charter for Innovation, Creativity and Access to Knowledge workshop in the 26C3 ]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [http://conference.freeculture.org/ Free Culture X Conference].&lt;ref name="FCX"&gt;[http://wiki.freeculture.org/FCX/Unconference/Charter_for_Innovation%2C_Creativity%2C_A2K Notes for the FCX Workshop: Charter for Innovation, Creativity and A2K]&lt;/ref&gt;

== FCForum 2010 ==
The second FCForum&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elpais.com/articulo/tecnologia/Barcelona/acoge/principal/foro/cultura/libre/Europa/elpeputec/20101028elpeputec_5/Tes&lt;/ref&gt; was held in Barcelona from October 28 to 31, 2010 and focused on economical models. It was organised by [[Xnet]], [[Simona Levi]], [[Mayo Fuster Morell]] and Yproductions, with the advise of [[Felix Stalder]]. It resulted in a [http://fcforum.net/en/sustainable-models-for-creativity Declaration and How to Manual on sustainability of creativity in the digital era]. The FCForum declaration was signed by 80 organisations and individuals, including [[Richard Stallman]].

=== Topics ===
Participants in the FCForum split into working groups focusing on the following topics:
# Economic Sustainability and Governance of Open Online Collaboration
# New models of sustainability for the creative sector
# Tools for policy reformers
# Open public sector information

=== Sustainable models for creativity in the digital age ===
In February 2011, two documents drafted by FCForum participants were released: [http://fcforum.net/en/sustainable-models-for-creativity/declaration ''Sustainable Models for Creativity''] and the [http://fcforum.net/en/sustainable-models-for-creativity/how-to-manual ''How-To Manual for Sustainable creativity''], addressed at political reformers, citizens and free culture activists. Both documents are based on an understanding that current royalties management and cultural distribution systems have become obsolete in the digital age, and the conviction that [[free software]] and peer production and distribution is not incompatible with market strategies and commercial distribution. The How-To Manual sets out a series of alternative commercial and non-profit models. It insists that the Internet must remain free and open in order to allow online collaboration models to develop, and it must be recognised as a tool that promotes contact between creators and the public. The manual offers an overview of new models that are already operating in a variety of fields, such as [[freemium]], [[crowdfunding]] and [[micropayment]] systems in which users make small financial contributions to projects that are looking for seed funding through platforms such as [[Kickstarter]] and lanzanos.com or to existing initiatives that are given money depending on the number of users who vote for them (such as [[Flattr]], created by [[Peter Sunde]] and [[Linus Olsson]]). It also claims that the creators of commercial cooperative platforms should share their profits with the creators of the content they publish.

== FCForum 2011 ==

The third annual FCForum was held in Barcelona on October 28, 29 and 30, under the title ‘Networks for a R-evolution’.

Day one revolved around sustainable models for creativity in the digital age. It included a round table on the current situation of film and the Internet in Spain, with [[Álex de la Iglesia]], Juan Carlos Tous, Amparo Peiró, Eudald Doménech and the lawyer Josep Jover. This was followed by a session in which Yproducciones, Kayros Transmedia, Daniel Granados, Kolector, [[Flattr]], Goteo and Verkami explored some new sustainable alternatives for the creative sec

Day two focused on challenges and tools for the defence of the Internet and of sharing in the framework of the digital revolution. Participants included the lawyer [[David Bravo]], [[La Quadrature du Net]], [[John Perry Barlow]] and [[Richard Stallman]].

== FCForum 2012 ==
The fourth FCForum was held at Ars Santa Mònica on October 26 and 27.

Day one explored the theme of sustainable models for the creative sector, with practical examples from the fields of journalism, education (Freeangle) and publishing (Bookcamping). The report on [[crowdfunding]] "Crowdfunding Experiences in Spain and Catalonia: Key Characteristics, Challenges and Obstacles. Inspiration and Recommendations for a Stronger Tool for Collective, Public and Private Cross-Financing” was presented by its authors.

One of the main sections looked at how cyber crime is being used as an excuse to criminalize and control the Internet, with an introduction by the lawyer Carlos Sánchez Almeida and presentations of projects such as [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor Project]] and [[Telecomix]].

Day two focused on democracy in the digital age, with debates on transparency in public institutions (Cuentas Claras, Discursia, Sueldos Públicos, Graba to Pleno, Qué hacen los diputados, Open Knowledge Foundation, Access Info, Tu Derecho a Saber and Civio), journalism and freedom of information, and networked democracy.

The 2012 FCForum also worked on a system for the collaborative reform of Intellectual Property legislation in Spain and the European Union, using documents linked to the FCForum and the proposal prepared by Quadrature du Net as a point of departure.

The 2012 FCForum team also participated in the book ''Cultura libre digital - Nociones básicas para defender lo que es de todxs'', which was published by Editorial Icaria in 2012.

The Human Be-In focused the key ideas of the [[1960s counterculture]]: personal empowerment, cultural and political decentralization, [[commune (intentional community)|communal living]], [[Ecology|ecological]] awareness, [[higher consciousness]] (with the aid of psychedelic drugs), acceptance of illicit psychedelics use, and radical [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[political consciousness]].&lt;ref name="Powis2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionetherlands.nl/features/cultureandhistory/031221be-in.html |publisher=Radio Netherlands Worldwide |first=Neville |last=Powis |title=The Human Be-In and the Hippy Revolution |date=22 January 2003 |access-date=21 April 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421102203/http://www.radionetherlands.nl/features/cultureandhistory/031221be-in.html |archivedate=21 April 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/thisday/jan14/human-be-/|title=Human Be-In|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2014-12-12|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hippies|hippie movement]] developed out of disaffected student communities around [[San Francisco State University]], [[City College of San Francisco|City College]] and [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] and in San Francisco's [[beat generation]] poets and jazz [[Hipster (1940s subculture)|hipsters]], who also combined a search for intuitive spontaneity with a rejection of "[[middle-class]] [[morality]]". [[Allen Ginsberg]] personified the transition between the beat and hippie generations.

The Human Be-In took its name from a chance remark by the artist [[Michael Bowen (artist)|Michael Bowen]] made at the [[Love Pageant Rally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfbg.com/entry.php?entry_id=4344&amp;catid=4&amp;volume_id=254&amp;issue_id=311&amp;volume_num=41&amp;issue_num=47|title=San Francisco Bay Guardian|work=sfbg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The playful name combined [[Humanism|humanist]] values with the scores of [[sit-in]]s that had been reforming college and university practices and eroding the vestiges of entrenched [[Racial segregation|segregation]], starting with the lunch counter sit-ins of 1960 in [[Greensboro sit-ins|Greensboro, North Carolina]], and [[Nashville sit-ins|Nashville, Tennessee]]. The first major [[teach-in]] had been organized by [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] at the [[University of Michigan]], 24–25 March 1965.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' 3/25/65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Event==
The Human Be-In was announced on the cover of the fifth issue of the ''[[San Francisco Oracle]]'' as "A Gathering of the Tribes for a Human Be-In". The occasion was a new California law banning the use of the psychedelic drug [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] that had come into effect on October&amp;nbsp;6,&amp;nbsp;1966.&lt;ref name = "Powis2003" /&gt; The speakers at the rally were all invited by Bowen, the main organizer. They included  [[Timothy Leary]] in his first San Francisco appearance, who set the tone that afternoon with his famous phrase "[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/music/article/Reliving-the-Human-Be-In-50-years-later-10854785.php#photo-12168922|title=Reliving the Human Be-In 50 years later|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Alpert (soon to be known as "[[Ram Dass]]"), and poets like [[Allen Ginsberg]], who chanted [[mantra]]s, [[Gary Snyder]] and Michael McClure. Other counterculture gurus included comedian [[Dick Gregory]], [[Lenore Kandel]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], [[Jerry Rubin]], and [[Alan Watts]]. The [[Hells Angels]], at the peak of their "outlaw" reputation, corralled lost children. Music was provided by a host of local [[rock band]]s including [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], and [[Blue Cheer]] most of whom had been staples of [[the Fillmore]] and the [[Avalon Ballroom]].&lt;ref name = "Miles2004"&gt;{{cite book | title = Hippie | first = Barry | last = Miles | author-link = Barry Miles | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fLulFlbAJGgC&amp;dq | date = 2004 | publisher = Sterling | isbn = 978-1-40271-442-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|186-191}} "Underground chemist" [[Owsley Stanley]] provided massive amounts of his "White Lightning" LSD, specially produced for the event, as well as 75 twenty-pound turkeys, for free distribution by the [[Diggers (theater)|Diggers]].&lt;ref name = Ringolevio&gt;{{cite book | last = Grogan | first = Emmett | title = Ringolevio: A Life Played for Keeps | publisher = Citadel Press | year = 1990 | url = http://www.diggers.org/ringolevio.htm | isbn = 0-8065-1168-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|267}}{{efn|[[Ringolevio]] p.274 - The turkeys had been made into thousands of sandwiches under John-John's supervision, and the bread was salted down with crushed acid.

The national media were stunned, publicity about this event leading to the mass movement of young people from all over America to descend on the [[Haight-Ashbury]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Grassroots Medicine: The Story of America's Free Health Clinics | first = Gregory L. | last = Weiss | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3NPaH01h0vYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA29#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | date = 2006 | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | isbn = 978-0-74254-070-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports were unable to agree whether 20,000&lt;ref name = "Powis2003" /&gt; or 30,000 people showed up at the Be-In.&lt;ref name = "Miles2004" /&gt;{{rp|188}} Soon every gathering was an "-In" of some kind: Just 4 weeks later was [[Bob Fass]]'s [[Bob Fass#Human Fly-In|Human Fly-In]], then the [[Emmett Grogan]] inspired [[Bob Fass#Sweep In|Sweep-In]], Rowan and Martin's ''[[Laugh-In]]'' comedy television show began airing over [[NBC]] just a year later on January 22, 1968. This was followed by the first "[[Bob Fass#Yip In at Grand Central|Yip-In]]" (March 21, 1968, at [[Grand Central Terminal]]), "[[Love-in|Love-In]]" (April 14, 1968, at Malibu Canyon) and "[[Bed-In]]" (March 25, 1969, in Amsterdam).

The Human Be-In was later recalled by poet [[Allen Cohen (poet)|Allen Cohen]] (who assisted the artist Bowen in the organizational work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Portable Sixties Reader | first = Ann | last = Charters | publisher = Penguin Classics | date = 2003 | isbn  = 978-0-14-200194-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=i05HZYZjTuUC&amp;pg=PA297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Brugman | first = Bruce | title = Tonight: The Human Be-In 2007 | url = http://www.sfbg.com/blogs/bruce/2007/08/the_human_bein_jan_l4_l967_to.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;) as a meld that brought together philosophically opposed factions of the San Francisco-based counterculture at the time: on one side, the Berkeley radicals, who were tending toward increased militancy in response to the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S.&amp;nbsp;government]]'s [[Vietnam war]] policies, and, on the other side, the rather non-political Haight-Ashbury hippies, who urged peaceful protest. Their means were drastically different, but they held many of the same goals.&lt;ref name="BB73"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://voices.revealdigital.com/cgi-bin/independentvoices?a=d&amp;d=BFBJFGD19670106&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN---------------1 | title = Berkeley Barb, (Issue 73) | date = 6 January 1967 | website = Independent Voices: An Open Access collection of an Alternative Press | access-date = 13 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Berkeley Barb]], (Issue 73) - Berkeley political activists are going to join San Francisco’s hippies in a love feast that will, hopefully, wipe out the last remnants of mutual skepticism and suspicion...

The San Franciscans didn’t want to play that game any more; it doesn’t work, they said, and the non-verbal modes of expression tell it where it’s at. The Berkeleyans wanted to play that game because that’s where the rest of society plays; that’s the only way, they said, to get through to most people. The hip wondered aloud whether the politicos would make the Gathering a haranguing rally. The politicos wondered aloud whether the hip would all happily turn on and any social message would be lost. They solved it.}}

According to Cohen's own account,&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;Cohen, Allen [http://s91990482.onlinehome.us/allencohen/be-in.html "About the Human Be-In"] Note: has links to scans of organizational letters that Cohen wrote. This articles is also quoted by Bruce Brugman, online: [http://www.sfbg.com/blogs/bruce/2007/08/the_human_bein_jan_l4_l967_to.html]&lt;/ref&gt; his friend Bowen provided much of the "organizing energy" for the event, and Bowen's personal connections also strongly influenced its character.&lt;ref&gt;As Allen Cohen put it: "he was friends with the Beat poets from the North Beach era, and had spent time with Tim Leary at Millbrook. He was an egocentric hustler who Allen Ginsberg had called the most convincing man he had ever known. He could charm the press and turn on a square. He credits himself for inviting Leary and the Beat poets to the Human Be-In, and arranging for it to be a worldwide media event."&lt;/ref&gt;

The counterculture that surfaced at the "Human Be-In" encouraged people to "question authority" with regard to [[civil rights]], [[women's rights]], and [[consumer rights]]. Underground newspapers and radio stations served as its [[alternative media]].&lt;ref name="BB73" /&gt;{{efn|[[Berkeley Barb]], (Issue 73) - The two radical scenes are for the first time beginning to look at each other more closely. What both see is that both are under a big impersonal stick called The Establishment. So they’re going to stand up together in what both hope to be a new and strong harmony.}}

== Influence ==
The Be-In later spawned a series of [[Digital Be-In]]s.

A UK&amp;nbsp;theatre company, Theatre&amp;nbsp;14167, (also 14167 films)  takes its name from the date of the Be-In; the company subsequently produced work by [[Michael McClure]], who read at the event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SJgrAQAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Theatre+14167%22 Theatre Record - Page 846, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hydro Sapiens''''' is an art performance performed by The Lunatics from The [[Netherlands]]. It premiered in [[Singapore]] at [[Bedok Reservoir]] on  20 June 2008. It was the official closing performance for the [[Singapore Arts Festival]] and was a collaboration with the Singapore International Water Week.

The forty-five minutes play explores the power of water through comedy and drama. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For every question, there is an answer… What is the power of water? How weak can it make you? Should we fear it, love it, hate it? A human being is made up 66% percent out of water, so why do we need more? And in how many ways a man can drown? For all these questions, The Lunatics will try to find the answers - through a very intensive, hilarious, spectacular and even brutal search for the right value of water....&lt;ref name="aboutsingapore_hydrosapiens"&gt;[http://www.siww.com.sg/aboutsingapore/hydrosapiens.php Singapore International Water Week - Powered by GlobalSign.In&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


It featured various special effects like pyrotechnics and impressive machinations. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Twelve fanatic and truly wet actors, thousand of litres of water, 45 minutes of splashing experiences, countless moments of awe, laughter and silence, and water in your eyes. In 2008 The Lunatics would like to present to you their newest adventure: Hydro Sapiens!&lt;ref name="aboutsingapore_hydrosapiens" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For its premiere, it was open to the public for free. An estimated 5000 people attended the performance

[[File:John Chilembwe.jpg|thumb|The last known photo of John Chilembwe (left) taken in 1914 about a year before his death]]
The ideas, people and events that constituted '''[[John Chilembwe|John Chilembwe's]] motivation''' and influenced him to undertake an [[Chilembwe uprising|uprising in 1915]] were considered by the [[Commission of Inquiry]] shortly after the rising was defeated and have exercised historians of [[Malawi]] for the last 60 years. Whether the dominant ideas were political, social, economic or religious and how these combined is unclear because Chilembwe did not leave a detailed record of the reasons for his armed revolt. As he was an ordained [[Baptist]] minister, much attention has focussed on his religious ideas, whether orthodox or related to [[millennialism]], the extent to which they existed, particularly in the period shortly before the rising, the part that such beliefs played in the decision to revolt and the course of the uprising.

Although there is reasonable evidence that, in the first decade after his return to Nyasaland at least, Chilembwe aimed at the social and economic advancement of Africans through education and the adoption of useful knowledge, following the ideas of [[Booker T. Washington]] and [[W.E.B. Du Bois]],&lt;ref&gt;Phiri (1999), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; there is little direct evidence of his ultimate political aims, his theological beliefs or what he preached, particularly in the first dozen years of his ministry. This may be because, as his surviving correspondence shows, he had little interest in discussing theology; in addition, he declined to follow [[Joseph Booth (missionary) | Joseph Booth]] in his [[sabbatarian]]ism, he had no known direct links to the [[Watch Tower Society]]&lt;ref&gt;Note: Between 1896 and 1955, the parent organisation was named the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania]] and commonly known as the Watch Tower Society and many authors call its Africa manifestations the Watchtower movement or Watchtower. There is inconsistency between various sources, but  Watch Tower Society  and Watchtower (movement) are used in this article&lt;/ref&gt; and is not known to have introduced any doctrinal innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), pp. 116, 169, 263, 324&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Booth, who was notorious for his radicalism and promotion of [[Christian fundamentalism| fundamentalist]] and promoting [[Ethiopian movement |Ethiopianism]]&lt;ref&gt;Lohrentz (1971), pp. 464-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Langworthy (1986), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Elliot Kenan Kamwana | Elliot Kamwana]], whose preaching was openly millennial and considered as anti-colonial,&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson (1954), pp. 233, 238-9&lt;/ref&gt; both of whom were unpopular with the colonial authorities and most European missionaries, and were both deported for expressing radical political views,&lt;ref&gt; Shepperson (1954), pp. 237, 239&lt;/ref&gt; up to 1914 at least, Chilembwe's work at the [[Providence Industrial Mission]] favourably impressed European officials and missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Mwase, (1967), p. xxi (Rotberg’s introduction).&lt;/ref&gt;

Undoubtedly millenarian uprisings did exist, such as that leading to [[Bulhoek massacre]], where there was no doubt that the participants, a religious group led by [[Enoch Mgijima]] with no political agenda, believed that the world would soon end and mounted frontal attacks on armed troops and police.&lt;ref&gt;Crais (2002), pp. 118-121.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cobbing, writing about an earlier colonial revolt, cautioned about pursuing the "false trail of  millenarianism" where unbearable political, social and economic pressures were sufficient causes for an attempt to drive out European colonisers, where there is no need to suggest other, less evident, causes and where the evidence for millenarianism is speculative or ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Cobbing (1958), pp. 82-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Chilembwe received an orthodox Baptist theological training in the US and he never joined any other denomination. He used biblical language in his correspondence, as may be expected from a Baptist minister, but (unlike Booth's and Kamwana's) his known writings were not unambiguously millenarian. As far as is known, Chilembwe held standard Baptist views, rejected the Saturday observance favoured by Booth, and stated that he had no connection with the Watchtower movement.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), pp. 169, 263, 324, 469.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Several historians consider that the Chilembwe uprising was planned, although perhaps without sufficient care, at several clandestine meetings before any action was taken, that Chilembwe acquired a textbook on military tactics,&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), pp. 257-61, 291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1965), pp. 135, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mwase (1967), pp. 34-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White (1987), pp. 132-3.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the authorities received advance warnings of the intended uprising several months before it took place.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), pp. 382, 471.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1965), pp. 82-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Another source claims that little or no preparation was made for the revolt, because the authorities discovered none from monitoring Chilembwe's correspondence, although it adds that he knew his mail was being monitored.&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), pp. 635, 639-40.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Context of Chilembwe's activities==
If Chilembwe made a detailed record of the reasons why he, an educated and respected clergyman, conspired with like-minded Africans to carry out an armed revolt against the [[Nyasaland]] government, that record has been lost, and he and most of his chief collaborators were killed or fled immediately after it and were not interrogated. A number of possible reasons have been proposed: some are supported by direct contemporary evidence, others depend on later sources or are more speculative. Chilembwe was apparently willing to work within the framework of the colonial system until 1912, although from 1909 his aim of improving the conditions of Africans, particularly labour tenants on European estates awakened a consciousness that might be considered nationalistic, and there were signs of alienation from European administrators and landowners&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1965), pp. 72, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;. There is good evidence that, as early as 1908 he had incurred debts and by 1914 was being pressed for payment while suffering from a reduction in support from the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. |National Baptist Convention]] in the United States. He was also suffering from asthma and failing eyesight.&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1970), pp. 365–6.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
From 1911, Chilembwe became increasingly concerned with the situation of Mozambican immigrants, many of whom were members of his church that worked on European-owned estates, particularly the [[A L Bruce Estates]] property at Magomero. These workers suffered from an increase in [[hut tax]] in 1912 and from famine in 1913.&lt;ref&gt; White (1987), pp. 131-3.&lt;/ref&gt; He and other mission-educated African "new men", some of whom became Chilembwe's lieutenants in the rising, were angered by the refusal of the settlers and government to accept their worth or provide them with suitable opportunities or a political voice.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), pp. 240–50&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the African casualties in the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African campaign]], both soldiers and porters, deeply affected him, and government demands for more porters had a direct impact on his Providence Industrial Mission members.&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1970), pp. 365–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page (1978), pp. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Accounts of Chilembwe and his uprising==
===Earlier accounts===
The colonial authorities sought first to contain, then to explain the revolt. It was contained by executing most of the African planters of [[Chiradzulu District]] and many of the Bruce Estate's foremen (or capitãos), both groups being seen as potential leaders. In April 1915, soon after the rebellion, the Nyasaland government set-up a [[Commission of Inquiry]] to report on the origins, causes and objectives of the "Native rising in the Shire Highlands". It consisted of three colonial administrators, a senior [[Anglican]] missionary, and a representative of the European estate owners, and its terms of reference included examining alleged grievances that may have influenced the rising and the effects of mission teaching.&lt;ref&gt; White (1984), pp. 519-21, 523.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Commission's report suggested that the main objective of the rising was to exterminate or expel Europeans and set up of an African state or theocracy with John Chilembwe at its head.&lt;ref&gt;Morris (2015), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; It put most of the blame on Chilembwe's political and religious teaching and the mainly immigrant congregation of his mission at Mbombwe, although it accepted that working conditions on some estates were often unsatisfactory&lt;ref&gt;White (1984), pp. 523-4&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission criticised the Scottish-run churches, especially the Church of Scotland's Blantyre Mission, which had educated had  many of Chilembwe's principal followers, for treating African church members as equals.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), pp. 364, 369, 375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (2016), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; It also considered that the independent African churches and Church of Christ and Seventh-Day Baptist missions, which it lumped together as "Watchtower",&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), p. 647.&lt;/ref&gt; had promoted racial animosity by preaching racial equality and should be subject to strict government control.&lt;ref&gt;Morris (2015), pp. 45-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first comprehensive biography of John Chilembwe by Shepperson and Price considered that the causes of his uprising went back many years rather than being triggered only by events shortly before it took place.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; They regarded Chilembwe as an early nationalist, looking forward to the creation of a nation, rather than to re-establishing traditional leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), pp. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; Chilembwe did not reject European education and civilisation but believed that Africans should share the benefits of Western technology and culture that the Europeans in Nyasaland monopolised.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), p. 421, 429.&lt;/ref&gt; These authors speculate that Chilembwe's main intention was to set up an independent, strongly theocratic African state in Nyasaland, although its proposed extent and its governance were unclear, and his secondary intention was to stage a protest against the war and colonial oppression&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and  Price (1958), pp. 254-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Shepperson continues to regard Chilembwe in nationalist terms, and regards his letter of November 1914 to the "Nyasaland Times" entitled "The Voice of African Natives in the Present War" as setting out his view that African fatalities and other sacrifices in [[World War I]] entitled them to respect and a share in government. It deserves attention as a statement of his aims and is critical to establish his motivation.&lt;ref&gt;Bone (2015), pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson (2015), pp. vi, 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
{{quotation | "We understand that we have been invited to shed our innocent blood in this world's war which is now in progress throughout the wide world. On the commencement of the war we understood it was said indirectly that Africa had nothing to do with the civilised war. But now we find that the poor African has already been plunged into the great war. 

A number of our people have already shed their blood, while some are crippled for life. And an open declaration has been issued. A number of Police are marching in various villages persuading well built natives to join in the war. The masses of our people are ready to put on uniforms ignorant of what they have to face or why they have to face it.
 
We ask the Honourable government of our country which is known as Nyasaland, Will there be any good prospects for the natives after the end of the war? Shall we be recognised as anybody in the best interests of civilisation and Christianity after the great struggle is ended? Because we are imposed upon more than any other nationality under the sun. Any true gentleman who will read this without the eye of prejudice will agree and recognise the fact that the natives have been loyal since the commencement of this Government, and that in all departments of Nyasaland their welfare has been incomplete without us. And no time have we been ever known to betray any trust, national or otherwise, confided to us. Everybody knows that the natives have been loyal to all Nyasaland interests and Nyasaland institutions. For our part we have never allowed the Nyasaland flag to touch the ground, while honour and credit have often gone to others. We have unreservedlv stepped to the firing line in every conflict and played a patriot's part with the Spirit of true gallantry. But in time of peace the Government failed to help the underdog. In time of peace everything for Europeans only. And instead of honour we suffer humiliation with names contemptible. But in time of war it has been found that needed to share hardships and shed our blood in equality. It is true that we have no voice in this Government. It is even true that there is a spot of our blood in the cross of the Nyasaland Government. But regarding this worldwide war, we understand that this was not a royal war, nor a government war, nor a war of gain for any description; it is a war of free nations against a devilish system of imperial domination and national spoliation. If this were a war as above mentioned such as war for honour, Government gain of riches, etc., we would have been boldly told: Let the rich men, bankers, titled men, storekeepers, farmers and landlords go to war and get shot. Instead the poor Africans who have nothing to own in this present world, who in death, leave only a long line of widows and orphans in utter want and dire distress are invited to die for a cause which is not theirs. It is too late now to talk of what might or might not have been. Whatsoever be the reasons why we are invited to join in the war, the fact remains, we are invited to die for Nyasaland. We leave all for the consideration of the Government, we hope in the Mercy of Almighty God, that some day things will turn out when and that Government will recognise our indispensability, and that justice win."

Shepperson and Price noted that Chilembwe had received an orthodox theological training with the support of the National Baptist Convention, one of the two largest Black [[Baptist]] groups in the USA. His work in Nyasaland received financial assistance from this organisation and never broke his link with it.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), p. 421 &lt;/ref&gt; Shepperson considered that Chilembwe had never claimed to be a prophet or messiah, and rejected the Commission of Inquiry's attempt to link him to the Watchtower movement.&lt;ref&gt; Shepperson (1954), p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Chilembwe stated that he had no connection with the Watchtower movement, other than having a few of its members in his congregation who might have been influenced by its views.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), pp. 166, 417.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Robert Rotberg also categorised Chilembwe's revolt as largely secular and nationalistic in origin, and suggested that he planned an independent government in the [[Shire Highlands]] if successful,&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1965), pp. 76, 85.&lt;/ref&gt; or a protest against colonial rule.&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that Chilembwe's nationalist awareness grew after 1909 and he became unwilling  to work within the colonial system after 1912, particularly when a severe famine in Mozambique in 1913 created a flood of migrants seeking a livelihood in Nyasaland.&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1965), pp. 72, 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rotberg modified his views over time, his main theme remained the link between early 20th century resistance movements and the secular nationalism that lead to independence in the second half of that century. He regarded Chilembwe as expressing orthodox Baptist views rather than millenarian teachings to a relatively small but stable congregation, at least until 1914. He considered Chilembwe's revolt was a reaction to the colonial government's failure to pay attention to his protest against African deaths in the war, but he accepted there were also some suggestions of millenarian [[eschatology]].&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1965), pp. 77, 80, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later ignored millennial influences and formed the view of Chilembwe's that decision to revolt resulted from a variety of psychological stresses.&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1970), pp. 367-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later accounts===
Although Shepperson and Price and Rotberg did not have access to full access to the colonial archives, Tangri who did later confirmed their view, stating that, although some of his followers may have been influenced by the Watchtower movement and received Watch Tower Society publications, there was no direct evidence to suggest that Chilembwe was in any way influenced by that movement,&lt;ref&gt;Tangri (1968), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and he stresses non-religious causes, mainly the conditions of workers on European-owned estates, particularly the [[A L Bruce Estates]] and Chilembwe's personal circumstances for the revolt, which aimed at setting up an African state if possible, or registering a symbolic protest if it failed.&lt;ref&gt;Tangri (1971), pp. 307-10, 312.&lt;/ref&gt; Tangri also notes Chilembwe's attempts to forge alliances with a number of independent African churches: although these included some millennial [[Seventh Day Baptist]] congregations in the [[Thyolo |Cholo]] area and [[Church of Christ |Churches of Christ]] in [[Blantyre District]], Tangri reported that his contacts with the orthodox churches that had broken away from European-run missions and small [[African initiated]] churches in the [[Zomba District|Zomba]], [[Mulanje |Mlanje]] and Blantyre districts were more numerous and their links with Chilembwe were more important than those with millennial ones.&lt;ref&gt;Tangri (1971), p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Phiri, who had full access to the records of the 1916 Commission of Inquiry, argues that Chilembwe's theological training and experience of racism in the United States resulted in a vision of achieving black freedom and equality through education, and also made him resentful of colonial domination and European attempts to limit African access to education.&lt;ref&gt;Phiri (1999), pp. 10, 21, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Phiri, who makes only one passing reference to the Watchtower movement,&lt;ref&gt;Phiri (1999), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; also quotes two credible sources who recorded that Chilembwe sent his forces out  with a short motivational speech that stressed patriotism, not millennialism:&lt;ref&gt;Phiri (1999), pp. 64-5.&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quotation |"You are going out to fight as African patriots, not just for Nyasaland but the whole of Africa, for the whole black race. Africa is one, from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean; remember this. Freedom is the cry for Africa, of the Negro race. I am not saying you are going to win the war and then become kings…some of us will die on the battlefield and leave behind widows and orphans, but they will be a free people. Our blood will mean something at last."

==Influence of Joseph Booth==
Chilembwe received some early education at the Blantyre Mission, but was not baptised into the Church of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt; Thompson, (2016) p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Joseph Booth (missionary) | Joseph Booth]] met John Chilembwe in Nyasaland, and when he later travelled with Chilembwe to the United States in 1897, Booth was still an orthodox Baptist minister but he left the [[Baptist Church]] in 1898, joining the [[Seventh Day Baptists]], and he remained in that denomination until 1901 when he left Nyasaland for [[South Africa]], becoming a [[Seventh-day Adventist]] there in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1965), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; When Chilembwe returned to Nyasaland in 1900, he was at first Booth's main contact during his absence from Nyasaland, but the relationship grew less close over time&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson (1954), p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Booth's main doctrinal concern, from 1898 until his death was a [[Sabbatarian]] belief, he was unable to convince Chilembwe, who did not follow Booth in his acceptance of this practice.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), pp. 119, 161, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Booth's membership of the Watch Tower Society lasted for only three years, from 1906 to 1909: there is no evidence that, then or later, Booth suggested that Chilembwe should join that society or adopt millennial beliefs, or that he sent Watch Tower Society literature to him .&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson (1954), pp. 231, 238.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Elliot Kenan Kamwana |Elliot Kamwana]], who was educated at the [[United Free Church of Scotland]] [[Livingstonia, Malawi | Livingstonia]] mission but left there in 1901, may have met Booth in southern Nyasaland in 1902 and been baptised as a Seventh Day Baptist there in 1902 before travelling to South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Fields (1985), pp. 105-6, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mphande (2014),  pp. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;. He certainly met Booth in South Africa in 1907, after Booth had been appointed as a missionary there by the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania |Watch Tower Society]]. Booth instructed Kamwana in a mixture of his own [[sabbatarian]] beliefs and Watchtower doctrines in preparation for Kamwana’ missionary work in Nyasaland.&lt;ref&gt;Donati (2011), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris (2016), p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Once Kamwana had returned to Nyasaland in 1908, he became Booth's main contact there, and received Watch Tower Society literature from him.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson (1954), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Kamwana left the Watchtower movement in 1909 because his [[Sabbatarian]] beliefs were incompatible with its teaching,&lt;ref&gt;Langworthy (1986), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Langworthy (1996), p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; although many of the churches he founded in northern Nyasaland continued to received publications and some funding from the American [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society]] until 1925, after which date that organisation disowned those congregations and tried to prevent them from using the Watchtower name. When Kamwana was allowed to return to Nyasaland in 1937, he initiated the Mlondo or Watchman Healing Mission, an [[African initiated church]] independent of the Watch Tower Society, although many members still read the society's magazines&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1965), pp. 139-40, 150-1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donati (2011), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;. Unlike Chilembwe, Kamwana left notebooks and letters that make his acceptance of millennial doctrines and on the [[Book of Revelations]] clear.&lt;ref&gt;Donati (2011), pp. 21-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Theologically, Kamwana would probably have believed that the initiative in overthrowing the British and bringing in the Millennium would come directly from God rather than from human agency.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (2015), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;He considered 1914 as the start of a new age of a kingdom of God in Africa, not one of the apocalyptic destruction of white rule, although European missionaries claimed his millennial doctrines that all government but Christ's would cease were seditious.&lt;ref&gt;Donati (2011), pp. 24-5, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
From 1910, Booth's main contact in Nyasaland became [[Charles Domingo]].&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson (1954), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lohrentz (1971), p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt; Domingo had been educated at Livingstonia mission and in South Africa and, on his return to Livingstonia, became a teacher and later a preacher there, but failed to secure [[ordination]].&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1965), pp. 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Langworthy (1985), pp. 96-7.&lt;/ref&gt; After breaking with the Free Church in 1908, he moved to southern Nyasaland and was baptised by Chilembwe, who encouraged him to move to [[Mozambique]], the country of his birth. In 1909 and 1910, Domingo corresponded with [[Charles Taze Russell]] and joined the [[Watch Tower Society]]. Domingo also made contact Joseph Booth, who had by then left the Watch Tower Society, and he joined an independent [[Seventh-day Baptist]] church formed by Booth's disciples in the north of Nyasaland on his return from Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;Langworthy (1985), pp. 97-100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lohrentz (1971), p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt; This church split into two sections in response to the Watch Tower Society 's opposition to [[Sabbatarianism]]. Most of these congregations, those founded by Domingo and other disciples of Booth, rejected Watch Tower Society control and, by 1911, their division from the remainder was total.&lt;ref&gt;Langworthy (1985), pp. 101-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his earlier membership of the Watch Tower Society, Domingo did not express any millennial expectations that 1914 would bring the start of the Millennialism |Millennium and the end of colonial rule.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (2015), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Booth's religious effect on his three Nyasaland protégés differed, reflecting the frequent changes in his denominational affiliations, his effect on their social and political outlooks was similar. Booth's aim was to achieve radical social change: he believed in complete racial equality, pacifism, the need to protest at the colonial powers' domination of Africans and expropriation of their land, and he advocated African religious, economic and political independence.&lt;ref&gt;Langworthy (1986), pp. 23-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1895 and 1897, Booth developed his scheme of "Africa for the Africans" to promote African economic independence. This was to be achieved by Christian [[Evangelism |evangelisation]], preferably by Africa-American and later African pastors, the provision of a superior level of education, including teaching practical skills, in Industrial Missions: ideals Chilembwe fostered in the Providence Industrial Mission.&lt;ref&gt;Langworthy (1986), pp. 27-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Once there were sufficient educated and economically independent Africans, Booth suggested that they should use lawful means to gain the same social and political recognition as whites, with the intention that power should return to African hands over a relatively short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Langworthy (1986), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar sentiments that were preached by Kamwana&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1965), pp. 68-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fields (1985), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; and Domingo, although he later became more conservative in later years.&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1965), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lohrentz (1971), pp. 475-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==African-American influences==
Chilembwe experienced contemporary American prejudice against negroes when he received his theological training in a segregated college in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], where he almost certainly studied [[African-American]] history and became aware of [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion]] and [[John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry]].&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), pp. 106–108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garvey (2006), p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt; The college principal, Gregory Willis Hayes, held militantly independent views, and the radical American Negro ideas he promoted through the works of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], [[Frederick Douglass]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and others had a profound effect on Chilembwe.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), pp. 79, 85–92, 112–118, 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson (1960), pp. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1970), pp. 356-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Shepperson and Price note there was a considerable African-American literature justifying violent uprising and supporting John Brown.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), pp. 239, 451.&lt;/ref&gt; although another source plays down the influence of American slave revolts on Chilembwe.&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), p. 642.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Separate African-American and African churches in the United States and South Africa arose from segregation in mainstream [[nonconformist]] churches and the formation of non-white congregations that retained links with those churches: these are "Ethiopian" churches in the strict sense.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson (1953), pp. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, other African-American and African congregations formed with no links to white churches or orthodox theology. These separatist churches were frequently [[Pentecostal]] and often described as [[Zionist Churches| "Zionist"]] in South Africa and were regarded as dangerous by the authorities there.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson, (1953), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethiopian movement| Ethiopian and Zionist churches]] in sub-Saharan Africa were closely linked in the European colonial mind with African-Americans (or Africans educated in USA) preaching what colonial missions considered was a debased version of Christianity that promoting African independence.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (2015), pp. 21-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Chilembwe was educated in the United States at a segregated college for African-Americans, was connected to an African-American institution and had African-American helpers&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (2015), pp 21, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to the definitions above, his American-inspired Providence Industrial Mission was an Ethiopian church with political aspirations resulting from these American influences. However, Kamwana's ministry, with its version of the Watchtower movement, apolitical, Zionist and with South African links, may be compared with of [[Enoch Mgijima]]'s "Israelites", although these fought against police and troops at Bulhoek.&lt;ref&gt; Shepperson (1953), pp. 12-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Throughout his ministry, Chilembwe was backed financially the [[National Baptist Convention of America]] who also sent him their publications and provided an African-American Baptist minister and another helper until 1906,&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), pp. 136–7, 457&lt;/ref&gt; and an African minister contemporary with Chilembwe in Nyasaland considered Chilembwe's teaching on race and colour differences to be purely American.&lt;ref&gt;McCracken (2012), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Shepperson has recently suggested that there was much uncatalogued documentary evidence about Chilembwe, mostly in America, particularly his letters to the National Baptist Convention's magazine, "The Missionary" that deserved further study.&lt;ref&gt;Bone (2015), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; An African-American view stresses Chilembwe's orthodox Baptist training in the US and considers that his reliance on the National Baptist Convention meant that the Providence Industrial Mission resembles an African-American mission comparable to the European missions, rather than an [[African initiated church]]. Chilembwe's view that blacks would achieve salvation and whites were heading for damnation probably came from his African-American training and contacts rather than inspiration from Watchtower or other millennial ideologies, and his ideal of African freedom was based on his admiration for [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;Y. Gershoni (1997), pp. 13, 48-50, 124-5, 177-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chilembwe's possible millennialism==
===Background===
The idea that Chilembwe was more than marginally affected by millennial views was examined by Jane and Ian Linden, whose study is almost entirely confined to the last year, particularly the last few months, of Chilembwe's life. Their argument for disregarding influences on Chilembwe before June 1914 is that in the second half of 1914 he became more receptive to millennial, and specifically Watchtower, influences.&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), pp. 634-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Their study claims that such previous authors as Shepperson and Price, Rotberg and Tangri minimised millennial explanations for the 1915 uprising,&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), pp. 646.&lt;/ref&gt; and they believe that, between October 1914 and January 1915, Chilembwe's attitude changed under millennial influence from passive acceptance of European dominance to rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), p. 646.&lt;/ref&gt; They regard Chilembwe sending his unpublished letter to a local newspaper in November 1914 as his last moderate act, after which he was pushed into a millennial uprising by his more militant followers.&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), p. 641.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linden with Linden (1974), pp. 94-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1975), pp. 179-80.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
While it is clear that the Watch Tower Society, certain other denominations and [[Elliot Kamwana]] held millenarian beliefs, the direct evidence for Chilembwe is unclear. The Lindens interpret an association between those that held such beliefs and John Chilembwe's followers as indirect evidence, what they term strong circumstantial evidence, that Chilembwe himself held the same millenarian beliefs,&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), pp. 636-8, 640.&lt;/ref&gt; and that these were central to his motivation for the uprising.&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), pp. 640, 644-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those they regard as his followers were members of acknowledged millennial congregations in [[Ntcheu District| Ncheu]] or [[Limbe, Malawi|Limbe]], in particular the minority sufficiently literate in English to read Watch Tower Society publications, and the focus of the Lindens' research is on what they refer to as the Ncheu side of the rising,&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), pp. 642-3 645.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than Chilembwe's own Providence Industrial Mission, although McCracken considers events in Ncheu to have been a parallel and abortive rising outside Chilembwe's control.&lt;ref&gt;J Linden and Linden (1975), pp. 169-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCracken (2012), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Kamwana and his close followers were pacifists, who probably believed that the start of the Millennium and the overthrow of colonial rule would be initiated directly by God, not come through human agency.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (2015), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his deportation in 1909 and even after the predicted Millennium did not begin in October 1914, the majority of Kamwana's followers remained pacifists, and later formed independent churches following a version of Watchtower doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;Fields (1985), pp.125–6.&lt;/ref&gt; A minority of his supporters joined Chilembwe's congregation, and some of that congregation received Watch Tower Society publications and expressed millennial beliefs,&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), pp. 638-9.&lt;/ref&gt; but only a handful of Kamwana's former supporters took part in the uprising&lt;ref&gt;Fields (1985), p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lindens list individuals said to have had some connection with Chilembwe's rising whose social position and religious beliefs are known. However, the list includes Eliot Kamwana and his pacifist followers who did not join the uprising, Seventh Day Baptists, and followers of Watchtower or Church of Christ who were not members of Chilembwe's Providence Industrial Mission and were at most sympathisers of the rebellion and those who joined Chilembwe's rebellion but had little or no connection with millennial doctrines. Only Duncan Njilima and two others can be shown both to have been involved in the uprising and with millennial leanings,&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), pp. 648-51.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chilembwe received some of his early education at the Church of Scotland's Blantyre Mission,&lt;ref&gt; Thompson (2016), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and, after his return to Nyasaland, he had limited but reasonably friendly relations with these missionaries. Many of his principal followers, including most of those involved in planning in the uprising, were educated at the Blantyre Mission, and 83 or 84 of those considered to be rebels were baptised members of the mission. Although some of these left the Church of Scotland to join Chilembwe's congregation, others remained its members, and the Nyasaland Government's Commission of Inquiry criticised Blantyre Mission's leadership for treating African church members as equals.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), pp. 364, 369, 375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linden with Linden (1974), p.101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[heterodoxy]] of early 20th century African congregations need not imply the heterodoxy of its pastors: Kamwana attracted huge audiences in 1908 and 1909 because his teaching addressed his audiences' concerns about [[witchcraft]],&lt;ref&gt;Fields (1985), pp. 120-1.&lt;/ref&gt; many members of [[United Free Church of Scotland]] congregations in the 1930s used charms against [[witchcraft]] and dancing and drumming to cure [[spirit possession]] despite missionary condemnation,&lt;ref&gt;Hokkanen (2007), pp. 737-9, 746-7&lt;/ref&gt; and shortly before 1914, many African members of conventional church congregations reverted to traditional beliefs or joined independent, African-initiated, churches. It is possible that the ordinary members of Chilembwe's congregations may have projected their distorted beliefs onto Chilembwe, rather than these being Chilembwe's own beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), p. 633.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence of millennial views===
The Lindens link Chilembwe's millennial views to the Watchtower movement, specifically to Kamwana's version of this,&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), pp. 631-3, 636-8, 646.&lt;/ref&gt; although they also mention some broader [[Eschatology| eschatological themes]] from the [[Book of Daniel]] and [[Book of Revelations]].&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), p. 639.&lt;/ref&gt; A later writer considers that Chilembwe was first influenced by radical evangelical concerns about racial injustice in the United States, views strengthened by his experiences in Nyasaland, but in the months before his rebellion, he concentrated increasingly on [[Old Testament]] End Times prophecies of the Book of Daniel, believing that they applied to the situation of Nyasaland in late 1914 and early 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (2017), pp. 51-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final, italicised sentence of Chilembwe's letter dated 22 December 1914 is described as an undisguised [[eschatological]] proclamation, demonstrating he saw himself as a messiah who would inaugurate the 'New Jerusalem’, :&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), p. 640.&lt;/ref&gt; although Chilembwe's interpretation of the final phrase is not recorded:
 
{{quotation |"We are not yet in prison.... It is true that I have written a letter to ask the government for the rights of my people. Brother Chinyama will tell you all about it as he has read the copy of the letter. My dear brethren be strong, preach the true Gospel trusting that our Heavenly Father will help us. Strengthen all weak brethren. ''Preach the Kingdom of God is at hand''."

Chilembwe first mentions his letter of November 1914 asking for African rights, hoping for divine help in achieving that objective and finishing with an seven-word phrase open to both millennial and non-millennial interpretations. [[Albert Schweitzer]] contended that "...the Kingdom of God is at hand" showed a purely future expectation of the Kingdom of God,&lt;ref&gt;Selby (1957), pp. 21, 25&lt;/ref&gt; whereas an opposing view is that the Kingdom of God, foretold by the prophets, began on earth at the start Christ's ministry.&lt;ref&gt;Blumer (2008), pp. 10-11, 185.&lt;/ref&gt; The English meanings of "at hand": "near in time" and "happening at the present" reflect two meanings in the Greek original.&lt;ref&gt;LaVerdiere (1999), pp. 62-3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the likely Hebrew original, meaning "to be present" or "to arrive", together with the opening phrase "The time is fulfilled..." points to a present time, not an expectation.&lt;ref&gt;Spangler and Tverberg (2018), p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Despite the claim that Chilembwe saw himself as a messiah, Shepperson and Price deny that Chilembwe was ever called himself a prophet or messiah figure.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt; Chilembwe's only recorded reference to "New Jerusalem" or "Jerusalem" was using these terms about his church at Mbombwe, which might have been a reference to Jerusalem, which in 1831 was the county seat of [[Southampton County]] Virginia, the area of [[Nat Turner]]'s rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence  to connect his use of these words to Charles Taze Russell's view of New Jerusalem as a symbolic representation of start of a millennial world government, whose inauguration should be awaited passively.&lt;ref&gt;Russell (1916), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rising===
The account suggests that, at least until December 1914, Chilembwe had made no plans for an uprising and that he did not play a prominent role in it.&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), pp. 635, 641, 644.&lt;/ref&gt; David Kaduya, a former [[King's African Rifles]]  soldier, who had talked of armed revolt since early 1914, was said to be the effective commander of the rising in the Shire Highlands,&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), pp. 641, 646.&lt;/ref&gt;, although other sources treat him as one of five or six leaders of armed groups agreed on by Chilembwe and his principal supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), pp. 258-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; White (1987), pp. 132-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J McCracken (2012), pp. 135-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaduya was employed by the Providence Industrial Mission: his religious beliefs were confused and unorthodox,&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), p. 641.&lt;/ref&gt; but he never hesitated in his view that that Africans should fight for their own nation.&lt;ref&gt;Phiri (1999), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Of the other leaders involved in the Blantyre attack, Duncan Njilima, a Providence Industrial Mission member, was said to hold millennial views&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), p. 651.&lt;/ref&gt; although, at his trial, Njilima pointed to a meeting that he and John Gray Kufa had with Chilembwe on 16 January 1915 was the impetus for the rising, when Chilembwe claimed:&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1970), p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phiri (1999), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation |"All the Europeans want to kill all of us black men. We will therefore go quickly and kill the Europeans.”{{cn|date=July 2018}}}}

Except that he was a Providence Industrial Mission member, little is known of Stephen Mkulitchi's religious views and John Gray Kufa, who was appointed lead one group, but failed to do so, was a [[deacon]] of the [[United Free Church of Scotland]]&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), pp. 243-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; White (1987), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The attacks on A L Bruce Estates properties, apparently in reaction to the estate's harsh treatment of its workers, were led by two former capitãos (foremen) of the estate who had been sacked in 1913 for membership of the Providence Industrial Mission.&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1965), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; White (1987), pp. 125-6, 132, 135-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The confusion that followed the initial Blantyre attacks might be attributed to the participants’ expectation of divine intervention,&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), pp. 63-4.&lt;/ref&gt; or their failure to achieve their objectives&lt;ref&gt; White (1987), pp. 136, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;. The attacks on A L Bruce Estates properties did achieve their more limited objectives, but the fighters sent to Blantyre failed either to obtain substantial quantities of arms or to provoke a significant popular uprising.&lt;ref&gt;McCracken (2012), pp. 136-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts of Chilembwe's final sermon at Mbombwe on 24 January 1915 differ between a message of acceptance of defeat&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mwase (1967), pp. 42-3.&lt;/ref&gt; and one focussed on the millennium&lt;ref&gt; White (1987), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCracken (2012), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Finally, the Lindens argue that ethnic and religious divisions in Nyasaland precluded a widespread commitment to any nationalistic or pan-African concepts Chilembwe may have had,&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), pp. 647-8.&lt;/ref&gt; but Phiri notes the broad range of supporters he gathered at Mbombwe in preparation for the uprising. This included participants from the Yao, Lomwe, Nyanja, Chikunda, Ngoni and Tonga communities, hoping to achieve the common goal of African independence.&lt;ref&gt;Phiri (1999), pp. 61-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Watch Tower Society theology==
From the 1870s, the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society]] prophesied an imminent [[Second Coming]] and millennial kingdom, created through supernatural agency not by human effort, which would replace the established social and political order.&lt;ref&gt;Zygmunt (1970), p. 926.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell at first accepted that the Second Coming had taken place in 1874 and [[Watch Tower Society unfulfilled predictions |predicted]] that an elect group of 144,000 saints marked for salvation would be completed in 1878. This date was deferred first to 1881, next to 1914 and then to various later years before a specific date was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Zygmunt, (1970), pp. 932-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Taze believed that the establishment of the millennial kingdom would involve a phase of social disintegration lasting several decades, the "Battle of Armageddon", which Watch Tower members were told not to join in, followed by a phase of reconstruction. Before this second stage, and probably before the climax of Armageddon, the elect of 144,000 righteous, not defined by race, would undergo a transformation from a physical to a spiritual form.&lt;ref&gt;Zygmunt (1970), pp. 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penton (2015), pp. 36-7, 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers on Chilembwe acknowledge that [[Charles Taze Russell]], the President of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, was a strict pacifist&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), pp. 633, 639.&lt;/ref&gt; who told his followers to recognise and cooperate with earthly governments and avoid militancy.&lt;ref&gt;Zygmunt (1970), p. 930.&lt;/ref&gt;. Kamwana claimed to have recruited and baptised whites as well as blacks in South Africa; &lt;ref&gt;Fields (1985), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; and he followed the orthodox Watchtower teaching that did not condone violence. In rejecting Kamwana, his former followers referred to Chilembwe as American,&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), p. 646.&lt;/ref&gt; and an African minister at Blantyre Mission regarded his views on race as American,&lt;ref&gt; McCracken (2012), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; not a description with millennial significance. Besides organising an armed uprising, Chilembwe, his followers claimed, considered all whites as unfit for salvation.&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), pp. 639, 646.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; McCracken (2012), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction and synthesis==
===Differing factual accounts===
A recent general account of the Chilembwe rising relies principally on Shepperson and Price, supplemented by the accounts of White, the Lindens and Phiri&lt;ref&gt;McCracken (2012), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; with some references to Rotberg, Langworthy and the Commission of Inquiry&lt;ref&gt;McCracken (2012), pp. 128, 131, 135-6.&lt;/ref&gt; This argues that the origins of the revolt were largely a result of the harshness of the [[thangata]] regime imposed on immigrants from Mozambique, Booth's and African-American influences on Chilembwe and denial of social and political advancement to educated Africans. It also suggests that its timing in early 1915, shortly after the start of the First World War and also at a time of apocalyptical expectations, was no coincidence&lt;ref&gt;McCracken (2012), pp. 128-136.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It does not deal with the differences in factual presentation rather than just interpretation between the accounts of four of those scholars and the Lindens. Most researchers believe that the grievances that drove Chilembwe to consider a rising became apparent from between 1909 and 1913, although he was probably prepared to accept the colonial framework until 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price, (1958), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1965), pp. 72, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; White (1987), pp. 131-3&lt;/ref&gt; It was probably the casualties among African soldiers and porters in the East African Campaign of the First World War that was the final trigger to his action.&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1970), pp. 365–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page (1978), pp. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative view is that Chilembwe's attitude changed from passive acceptance of European dominance to rebellion only between October 1914 and January 1915, and that he was pushed into an uprising by the millennial expectations of his more militant followers.&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), pp. 641, 646.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linden with Linden (1974), pp. 94-5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1975), pp. 179-80.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The majority of authors also believe that the Chilembwe uprising was planned over several months in 1914 and early 1915 and that Chilembwe himself took a leading part in the planning.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), pp. 257-61, 291, 382, 471.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rotberg (1965), pp. 82-3 135, 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White (1987), pp. 132-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (2016), pp. 51-2&lt;/ref&gt; The Lindens claim that little or no preparation was made for the revolt before January 1915, and that Chilembwe did not play a prominent role in its planning or direction.&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), pp. 635, 641, 644.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the confused state of the rebels after the first night of the rising is attributable either to their failure to obtain guns or create a popular uprising,&lt;ref&gt; White (1987), pp. 136, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCracken (2012), pp. 136-7.&lt;/ref&gt; or their expectation of divine intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), pp. 63-4.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Despite Shepperson's view that Chilembwe had never claimed to be a prophet or messiah and could not be linked to the Watchtower movement.&lt;ref&gt; Shepperson (1954), p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; There is increasing support for the view that the uprising had a definitely Christian, and possibly millennial inspiration, and that Chilembwe should be regarded as a prophet,&lt;ref&gt;Bone (2015), pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; possibly an armed prophet like [[Nat Turner]] or [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;Garvey (2006), p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative interpretations=== 
In the dispute on ideas that influenced Chilembwe, those scholars who concentrated on the social, economic and political aspects of his rising face the counterargument that he and his followers were influenced more by millennial ideas than nationalistic ones.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (2015), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only should writers considering such aspects not exclude religious motivations, but the political context of the religious beliefs of Chilembwe and his followers should be considered, something missing from the Linden's analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Fields (1985), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several recent writers consider that Chilembwe and his fellow "new men" were forward looking, but their rising was a reaction to colonial pressures and predated nationalist movements, although they sometimes used apparently nationalistic terms.&lt;ref&gt;White (1987),  p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bone (2015), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris (2015), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Most early African interest groups in Nyasaland were local, represented only a small educated African elite and promoted their demands for a political voice, not independence. Only in the 1940s, with the formation of the Nyasaland Native Congress, did one organisation represent the whole of Nyasaland and only in the 1950s did it start to press for future African majority rule.&lt;ref&gt;van Velson (1966), pp. 376-8, 400, 411.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCracken (1998), pp. 234-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, if not a struggle for national independence, the rebellion was essentially a struggle for freedom from colonial restrictions that particularly affected two separate groups. The first group was agricultural workers, particularly Mozambican immigrants on European-owned estates, overworked, often physically ill-treated and suffering under the [[thangata]] regime, who formed the bulk of his Chilembwe's congregation.&lt;ref&gt;White (1984), p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCracken (2012), pp. 128-131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris (2015), pp. 20-1, 27, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Chilembwe's preaching of Joseph Booth's radical egalitarian message had great appeal to them.&lt;ref&gt;White (1987),  p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; The second group were an emerging but discontented group of educated Africans, small-scale capitalists, planters and entrepreneurs, who were Chilembwe's friends and associates but not necessarily members of his church. They were frustrated by their inferior social position and lack of a political voice and responded to African-American Baptist ideals of private land ownership, trading or commercial agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;White (1987),  p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris (2015), pp. 27, 29, 34-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most meetings between Chilembwe and his principal followers before the uprising were secret, so it is difficult to prove whether millennial or proto-national ideas were discussed. Although the Lindens rely on the information some witnesses gave to the government inquiry after the rising ended, this should be treated with some caution.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (2015), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of the influence by Watchtower's millennial ideas on Chilembwe is also unprovable in the absence letters or diaries revealing his motivation, although the views in his letter to the Nyasaland Times in November 1914 argue against it being significant.&lt;ref&gt;White (1987), pp. 132-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The most that can be said with confidence was that millennial ideas were widespread in Africa in this period and Chilembwe and some followers may have been influenced by them to some extent&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (2015), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthesis===
Chilembwe's personal motivation remains uncertain, but his concerns over the plight of immigrant workers on European-owned estates under the system of [[thangata]], his quarrel with the [[A L Bruce Estates]] and [[William Jervis Livingstone]], his growing hostility towards European rule from 1912 onwards and anger at African involvement in the First World War have all been recorded, as were his declining health, financial difficulties and personal problems. None of these alone can be proven as causing the rising but none can be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;White (1984), p. 521&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCracken (2012), pp. 128-136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bone (2015), pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, (2015). p. 27, 36-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

An African-American view, although acknowledging the Lindens' work, stresses the orthodox training Chilembwe received in the US and his reliance on the assistance provided by the National Baptist Convention, so that the Providence Industrial Mission could be considered as an African-American mission comparable to the European missions in Nyasaland. Rather than being inspired by millennial ideology, Chilembwe's view that blacks would achieve salvation and whites were heading for damnation probably came from his African-American training and contacts and his ideal of African freedom was based on his admiration for [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;Gershoni (1997), pp. 13, 48-50, 124-5, 177-8.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Millennial expectations were high in Central Africa in 1914, but these views were mostly associated with Eliot Kamwana.&lt;ref&gt;Gershoni (1997), pp. 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Kamwana's former followers were attracted to Chilembwe as possibly the only available charismatic African preacher after Kamwana's deportation or the failure of his prophesies.&lt;ref&gt;Gershoni (1997), pp. 49-50&lt;/ref&gt; This attraction might not have derived from any contact Chilembwe had with Watchtower or his holding millenarian views but because his American training and African-American contacts connected him to an established African myth of the African-American as saviours who would free Africans from white rule. [[Terence Ranger]] argued that, when the Watchtower prediction of the end of the world in October 2014 proved incorrect, some Africans left millennial and messianic movements in favour of groups that could be connected to the African-American soldiers who said to be fighting against British forces in [[Karonga]].&lt;ref&gt;Gershoni (1997), pp. 48-9.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the Commission of Inquiry considered Chilembwe was influenced by the millennial beliefs it described generically as "Watchtower",&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), p. 647.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B Morris, (2015). pp. 45-6.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was also associated in the European mind with radical Ethiopianism,&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (2015), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Chilembwe was probably influenced by a range of religious ideas, orthodox, millennial, eschatological and even indigenous ones, although the extent of each is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (2015), pp. 24-5.&lt;/ref&gt; His contacts  with millennial congregations were part of an attempt to form alliances with other independent African churches, orthodox and millennial, not purely for religious reasons: his contacts with orthodox churches were more numerous than those with millennial ones.&lt;ref&gt;Tangri (1971), p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
McCracken notes the influence of the Church of Scotland Blantyre Mission on several of Chilembwe's principal followers educated there.&lt;ref&gt;Bone (2015), pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Others of Chilembwe's educated followers belonged to several congregations and had a range of religious beliefs,&lt;ref&gt;Linden and Linden (1971), pp. 648-51.&lt;/ref&gt; Those ordinary Africans considered to be rebels whose denominational allegiances are known belonged either to Chilembwe's Providence Industrial Mission or to Blantyre mission.&lt;ref&gt;Shepperson and Price (1958), pp. 364, 369.&lt;/ref&gt; Although both these normally required several years as a [[catechumen]] before baptism, shortly before the uprising, Chilembwe baptised hundreds of newly arrived workers on the Magomero estate. These were apparently potential recruits for an attack on the colonial system with little doctrinal understanding.&lt;ref&gt;White (1987) , p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Returning to Cobbing's cautionary comments on the "false trail of millenarianism", some elements of Nyasaland's African population were under severe political, social or economic pressures that might be sufficient causes for an attempted rising against colonial rule. It is difficult to say which of these pressures was most acute, and it would also be difficult to rule out a role for millenarianism, even though the evidence is speculative and ambiguous, but any explanation of the causes of the rising and Chilembwe's motivation must consider all the available information and prioritise the most reliable and least speculative sources.

'''John Minchin Lloyd''' (1835 — December 18, 1892) was a bricklayer and police officer in [[Washington, D.C.]], in the United States. He was one of the first police officers hired by the [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia]] when its Day Watch was first formed in 1855. He played a role in the trial of the conspirators in the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination]]. Arrested but never charged in the conspiracy, Lloyd's testimony was critical in convicting [[Mary Surratt]].

==Early life and career==
John Minchin Lloyd's date of birth is not clear, but two sources have him born in 1835 in southern [[Maryland]] in the United States to William Lloyd.{{sfn|Lloyd|1971|page=145}}{{Efn|Tindall gives his birth date as December 18, 1824.{{sfn|Trindal|1996|page=227}}&lt;ref&gt;{{John Surratt: Rebel, Lincoln Conspirator, Fugitive By Frederick Hatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Lloyd|1971|page=266}}}} He was the oldest of two sons. By 1850, 14-year-old John and his father had moved into Washington, D.C. He probably had little schooling, and instead apprenticed as a bricklayer. By 1855, John Lloyd was working full-time as a bricklayer, and living at 506 8th Street NW.{{sfn|Lloyd|1971|page=145}}

The City of Washington had organized a night [[constabulary]] in October 1804, but after members of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] rioted in the city in 1842 and nearly assaulted President [[John Tyler]], a new [[police]] force was organized.{{sfn|Sylvester|1894|pages=23-28}} In March 1851, the police force was reorganized into a day watch, night watch, and auxiliary. John M. Lloyd was appointed one of new police officers,{{sfn|Lloyd|1971|page=145}} at a yearly salary of $480 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|480|1851}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).{{sfn|Sylvester|1894|page=30}} It is not clear when Lloyd joined the force or what duties he was assigned, for he does not appear in the list of officers assigned to wards in 1851.{{sfn|Sylvester|1894|page=30}} But in 1855, records show that Lloyd was assigned to the 7th Police District,{{Efn|Lloyd was living at 91 M Street SW in 1855.{{sfn|Lloyd|1971|page=145}}}} and his pay was raised to $576 a year (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|576|1855}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).{{sfn|Sylvester|1894|page=31}} His pay rose to $630 a year (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|630|1858}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) in 1858.{{sfn|Sylvester|1894|page=32}}

The District of Columbia's [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia|Metropolitan Police Department]] was organized by Congress in August 1861, replacing the police forces of the City of Washington, [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], and the District of Columbia (that portion of the District outside the City of Washington's city limits).{{sfn|Sylvester|1894|page=32}} For reasons that are not clear, Lloyd left the Metropolitan Police Department in 1862.{{sfn|Lloyd|1971|page=146}} His profession upon leaving the police force is also unknown. It is well understood, however, that Lloyd was openly sympathetic to the cause of the [[Confederate States of America]].{{sfn|Schuetz|1994|page=56}} The [[American Civil War]] broke out in April 1862, 1861and Lloyd may have left the force due to his political views.

==Involvement in the Lincoln assassination==

===Leasing the Surratt tavern===
Lloyd moved out of the District of Columbia after resigning from the police force,{{sfn|District of Columbia Supreme Court|1867|page=276}} and into [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]].{{sfn|Larson|2008|page=43}} He later told Mary Surratt that he spent time running a tavern there.{{sfn|Larson|2008|page=43}} In December 1864, Lloyd moved to the bustling village of [[Clinton, Maryland|Surrattsville]].{{sfn|District of Columbia Supreme Court|1867|page=276}} Mary Surratt, a widow and Confederate sympathizer, owned a tavern, inn, carriage house, corn crib, forge, general store, granary, gristmill, stable, [[Curing of tobacco|tobacco curing house]], [[Wheelwright|wheelwright's shop]] in the center of town,{{sfn|Leonard|2004|page=43}}{{sfn|Busch|1954|page=17}}{{sfn|Larson|2008|pages=20-21}} and {{convert|200|acre|hectare}} of nearby farmland.{{sfn|Larson|2008|page=17}} In the fall of 1864, she began considering moving to her townhouse in the city.{{sfn|Chamlee|1989|page=165}} Surratt leased her tavern to Lloyd on December 1 for $500 a year, and moved into town the same day.{{sfn|Oldroyd|1901|page=159}}{{sfn|Kauffmann|2004|page=167}}{{sfn|Chamlee|1989|page=165}}{{sfn|Larson|2008|page=38}}

Mrs. Surratt lived in her townhouse with her daughter, Anna, and son, John. Over the next five months, she rented rooms to a number of people, including [[Louis J. Weichmann]], [[George Atzerodt]], and [[Lewis Powell (conspirator)|Lewis Powell]]. These three men, John Surratt, and [[John Wilkes Booth]] subsequently conspired to kidnap President Abraham Lincoln in March 1865. When that plot failed, they decided to assassinate the president instead. Lincoln was fatally shot at [[Ford's Theatre]] on the evening of April 14, 1865.

===Meetings with the conspirators===
As part of the plot to kidnap Lincoln in March 1865, John Surratt, Atzerodt, and conspirator [[David Herold]] hid two [[Spencer repeating rifle|Spencer carbines]], ammunition, and some other supplies at the Surratt tavern in Surrattsville.{{sfn|Verge|2003|page=53}}{{sfn|Turner|1982|page=155}}{{sfn|Griffin|2006|page=212}}{{sfn|Kauffmann|2004|pages=187-188}} On April 11, Mary Surratt rented a carriage and drove to the Surrattsville tavern to collect (she later said) a debt owed her by a former neighbor.{{sfn|Larson|2008|page=77}}{{sfn|Steers|2010|page=349}}{{sfn|Kauffmann|2004|page=208}} But according to Lloyd, Surratt told him to get the "shooting irons" ready to be picked up.{{sfn|Verge|2003|page=53}}{{sfn|Trindal|1996|page=161}}{{sfn|Larson|2008|page=130}} Worried that the inn might be searched by federal troops, Lloyd was concerned about the weapons left in his possession.  Later that day, he asked George Atzerodt what to do with them, and was told to bury them.{{sfn|Larson|2008|page=69}}

On April 14, Surratt once again visited the family tavern in Surrattsville on April 14 (the day of the assassination) to collect a debt.{{sfn|Verge|2003|page=53}}{{sfn|Larson|2008|page=83}} Shortly before she left the city, Booth visited the Surratt boarding house and spoke privately with Mrs. Surratt. He gave her a package (later found to contain [[binoculars]]) to give to Lloyd.{{sfn|Verge|2003|page=53}}{{sfn|Larson|2008|pages=83-84}}{{sfn|Swanson|2007|page=19}} Surratt delivered the package, and (according to Lloyd) again told Lloyd to have the "shooting irons" ready for pick-up and handed him a wrapped package from Booth.{{sfn|Verge|2003|page=53}}{{sfn|Turner|1982|page=155}}{{sfn|Larson|2008|pages=83-84}}{{sfn|Swanson|2007|page=22}}{{sfn|Trindal|1996|page=157}} (Booth and Herold picked up the rifles and binoculars that evening as they fled Washington after Lincoln's assassination.){{sfn|Verge|2003|page=53}} Lloyd repaired a broken spring on Mrs. Surratt's wagon before she left.{{sfn|Swanson|2007|page=22}}{{sfn|Verge|2003|page=56}}{{sfn|Leonard|2004|page=97}}{{sfn|Larson|2008|page=86}}

===Arrest and confession===
Federal investigators immediately identified Booth and his co-conspirators, and believed they had headed south into Maryland and then Virginia in an attempt to escape. Nodley Anderson, an innkeeper in the hamlet of Piscataway, Maryland, notified them that the Surratt tavern in Surrattsville was a notorious meeting place for Confederate spies, and that Lloyd may know something about the assassination.{{sfn|Larson|2008|page=102}} When questioned, Lloyd initially denied knowing Booth or Herold, and had seen neither man the night of the assassination. He was questioned a second time by D.C. police, and repeated his claims.  After the police left, he fled the tavern and went to the home of his wife's relatives in the hamlet of Allens Fresh, [[Charles County, Maryland]].{{sfn|Kauffmann|2004|pages=256, 261}} But local Surrattsville residents told investigators that Lloyd did indeed know Booth and some of the other conspirators, and with Mrs. Surratt having been arrested on April 17, federal troops finally went in pursuit of Lloyd.{{sfn|Chamlee|1989|pages=126-127}} Lloyd had already decided to return to Surrattsville to avoid suspicion, and was arrested on the road there on April 18, 1865.{{sfn|Larson|2008|page=102}}{{sfn|Trindal|1996|page=133}}

John Lloyd was interrogated at a makeshift headquarters in Robey's post office in Surrattsville on April 18, 19, and 20. His interrogators included Captain George Cottingham, U.S. Army, several other U.S. Army officers, and several D.C police detectives.{{sfn|Larson|2008|pages=102-103}} Whether Lloyd was tortured in order to obtain his testimony is highly contested by published sources. Several sources claim Lloyd was an alcoholic, and was denied liquor in order to take advantage of his illness and make him talk.{{sfn|Balsiger|Sellier|1977|page=196}}{{sfn|Jameson|2013|page=105}}{{Efn|Whether Lloyd was an alcoholic is hotly contested. Many sources, such as Jameson;{{sfn|Jameson|2013|page=105}} Balsiger and Sellier;{{sfn|Balsiger|Sellier|1977|page=196}} and Tidwell, Hall, and Gaddy{{sfn|Tidwell|Hall|Gaddy|1988|page=432}} claim he was a drunkard all his life. But documentation of this is lacking. It is well-documented, however, that several weeks before the assassination, Lloyd began drinking very heavily and was drunk the day of the event. But as Larson points out, many eyewitnesses said Lloyd was not so drunk, however, that he could not repair Mrs. Surratt's wagon spring, and was sober enough to steer his wagon to Washington, D.C., and back without weaving on the road.{{sfn|Larson|2008|page=74}}}} Some sources claim Lloyd was hung by his thumbs until he agreed to testify against Mrs. Surratt.{{sfn|Balsiger|Sellier|1977|page=196}}{{sfn|Jameson|2013|page=105}}{{sfn|Trindal|1996|page=133}}{{Efn|Jameson provides no source or citation for this claim. Trindall, and Balsiger and Sellier, rely on an unpublished paper by [[Rankin Barbee|David Rankin Barbee]] titled "The Murder of Mrs. Surratt", presented at the [[Emerson Preparatory School|Emerson Institute]] (a private D.C. [[University-preparatory school|prep school]]) on February 25, 1950.}} Higdon says Lloyd was merely threatened with hanging by his thumbs, but not tortured.{{sfn|Higdon|2008|page=53}} But most sources claim that Lloyd was merely intensively interrogated without the use of torture or deprivation of alcohol.{{sfn|Kauffmann|2004|pages=286-287}}{{sfn|Swanson|2007|pages=222-223}}{{sfn|Pittman|1865|page=124}}{{sfn|Chamlee|1989|page=126}}{{Efn|Gary R. Planck, literary editor of the ''Lincoln Herald'' (a scholarly journal publishing articles about Abraham Lincoln, the Civil War, and America in the 1850s and 1860s), has pointed out that "being 'coerced into giving testimony,' even threatened if he failed to do so, does not prove the testimony given was false."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Planck|first=Gary R.|title=Publication/Playback Review: 'Who Was Who in the Civil War' by Stewart Sifakis|journal=Lincoln Herald|date=Fall 1989|page=125|url=http://cdm15995.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/myfirst/id/3335/rec/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Larson argues that the interrogation merely consisted of "several days of back-and-forth questioning, stalling, intimidation, and obfuscation, manipulating Lloyd and wearing him down in the hopes of extracting a confession."{{sfn|Larson|2008|pages=102-103}} Cottingham revealed that [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]] had called for the death penalty for the conspirators. Cottingham played off Lloyd's fears that his family might also be arrested or tried, and that the military would seek to put him to death unless he confessed. Lloyd told Cottingham that he feared being murdered by the other conspirators,{{sfn|Larson|2008|page=103}} but by April 22 Cottingham had wrung a full confession from Lloyd.{{sfn|Tidwell|Hall|Gaddy|1988|page=432}}

Lloyd informed his interrogators that [[John Surratt]], Atzerodt, and Herold had hidden a pair of carbines, ammunition, some rope, and a wrench in a wall on the second floor.  He admitted that Mrs. Surratt had reminded him of their existence on April 11 and April 14. He also revealed that Booth and Herold had visited the tavern near midnight on April 14, taking one of the guns as well as the field glasses and some whiskey. Booth, Lloyd said, bragged that he had killed Lincoln. Lloyd helped the investigators recover the second gun, which confirmed his testimony.{{sfn|Larson|2008|page=103}} Seeing his wife at the tavern, Lloyd cried, "Oh, Mrs. Surratt, that vile woman, she has ruined me! I am to be shot!"{{sfn|Pittman|1865|page=124}}

Lloyd was transferred to the Union Army's headquarters at [[Bryantown, Maryland]], where he was further interrogated by Colonel Henry H. Wells. He revealed more details of the conspiracy, and of Booth and Herold's visit on April 14. Portions of his testimony tended to implicate John and Mary Surratt, George Atzertodt, and David Herold in the assassination plot.{{sfn|Larson|2008|page=104}}

Lloyd was transferred to the [[Old Capitol Prison]] in Washington D.C., on April 23. He was questioned further there.{{sfn|Larson|2008|page=104}}

===Assassination trial testimony===
Although John Lloyd was imprisoned for some weeks, he was never charged with any crimes and was eventually released.{{sfn|Larson|2008|page=104}} The reason was his testimony: The law at the time did not permit prosecutors to try a witness for conspiracy if he testified against his co-conspirators. Secretary of War Stanton and military prosecutors understood that Lloyd would go free, but they would win the conviction of Surratt and the others in the process.{{sfn|Larson|2008|page=105}}

The prosecution presented nine witnesses against Mrs. Surratt, but most of their case rested on the testimony of just two men—John Lloyd and Surratt boarding house tenant [[Louis Weichmann]].{{sfn|Verge|2003|page=54}}{{sfn|Cashin|2002|page=291}}

Lloyd testified on May 13 and 15, 1865,{{sfn|Leonard|2004|page=109}} regarding the hiding of the carbines and other supplies at the tavern in March, and the two conversations he had with Mrs. Surratt in which she told him to get the "shooting irons" ready.{{sfn|Turner|1982|page=155}}{{sfn|Verge|2003|page=54}}{{Efn|George Atzerodt made a statement to James McPhail, the civilian Provost Marshal of Baltimore, on May 1, 1865. McPhail, accompanied by Atzerodt's brother-in-law, John L. Smith, interviewed Atzerodt, who revealed that Dr. [[Samuel Mudd]] was much more intimately involved in the kidnap and murder plots against Lincoln than other evidence suggested. Confirming some of Lloyd's testimony, Atzerodt also said that Mary Surratt had gone to the tavern on April 15 specifically to retrieve the weapons hidden there a month earlier by Atzerodt, Herold, and her son John. However, McPhail turned this statement over to Atzerodt's attorney, William E. Doster, rather than to General [[John F. Hartranft]], commander of the Old Capitol Prison and the individual overseeing the continuing interrogations. Doster, perhaps realizing how damaging it was, did nothing with it. The testimony was only briefly and tangentially raised at the trial. In 1977, historian Joan Chaconas contacted Doster's grandson, who showed her papers containing Atzerodt's statement.{{sfn|Fishel|1996|page=335}} "Had it been revealed," historians Edward F. Steers and Harold Holzer write, "it most likely would have sent Dr. Samuel Mudd to the gallows."{{sfn|Steers|Holzer|2009|pages=26-28}}}} The defense called Captain Cottingham, and unintentionally damaged its case. Cottingham testified that Lloyd feared that the conspirators would kill him. When asked who Cottingham believed the conspirators to be, he mentioned Lloyd's outburst about "Mrs. Surratt, that vile woman" and said he had concluded that Lloyd meant Mrs. Surratt was one of the conspirators.{{sfn|Larson|2008|pages=122-124}} Lloyd's testimony had been the most important for the prosecution's case,{{sfn|Steers|2010|page=519}}{{sfn|Leonard|2004|page=108}}{{sfn|Griffin|2006|page=349}} for it indicated Mary Surratt played an active role in the conspiracy in the days just before Lincoln's death.{{sfn|Verge|2003|page=56}}

The defense strategy was to impeach Lloyd's testimony. Several witnesses impugned Lloyd's character by testifying about his alcoholism.{{sfn|Verge|2003|page=56}} Several eyewitnesses said he appeared completely intoxicated on the day of Lincoln's death (April 14), implying that he could not have remembered with clarity what happened that day.{{sfn|Verge|2003|page=56}}{{sfn|Leonard|2004|page=118}} Surratt's chief attorney, [[Reverdy Johnson]], asserted repeatedly that Lloyd was an unreliable witness, and that the evidence against Mary Surratt was [[Circumstantial evidence|entirely circumstantial]].{{sfn|Verge|2003|page=58}} The only evidence linking Surratt to the conspiracy to kill Lincoln, he said, came from Lloyd and Weichmann, and neither man was telling the truth (he said).{{sfn|Verge|2003|page=58}} Lloyd's testimony was coerced, he claimed.{{sfn|Zanca|2008|page=69}} The government's case was hindered by its failure to call as a witness the man who shared Lloyd's carriage when he talked with Mrs. Surratt (an individual who could have verified Lloyd's version of the "shooting irons" story).{{sfn|Chamlee|1989|page=434}}

The nine-member military tribunal hearing the case sentenced Mary Surratt, George Atzerodt, David Herold, and Lewis Powell to death on July 5, 1865. As their crimes had occurred in an area under military jurisdiction, the [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act 1863|Habeas Corpus Suspension Act]] denied them any appeal. The four were hanged at the [[Fort Lesley J. McNair|Washington Arsenal]] on July 7, 1865.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3120">The '''K1C2 formula''', which stands for "[[Korean War|Korea]], [[Communism]], and [[Corruption]]", was a campaign platform devised by [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in the [[United States Presidential Election of 1952]]. Even though he was aloof from party politics, he vowed to personally go to Korea if he was elected. This was a defining moment in the return of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] had dominated the presidency since 1933 and this was a return to office for the Republicans that had been a long time coming.&lt;ref&gt;Professor [[Kevin M. Kruse]], Associate Chair of History at Princeton University, lecture dated 13 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korea==  
After [[United Nations]] forces retook "Line Kansas" in May 1951,&lt;ref&gt;James L. Stokesbury (1990), ''A Short History of the Korean War'', New York:  Harper, pp. 136-137, {{ISBN|0-688-09513-5}} .&lt;/ref&gt; the Korean War had been stalemated:  the dying went on, but little territory changed hands.  

==Communism==  
In September 1945, [[Igor Gouzenko]], a [[GRU]] cipher clerk who had worked for the Soviet mission in [[Ottawa]], defected, bringing documents which showed that the  [[Manhattan Project]] had been penetrated.&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Finkel and Margaret Conrad (2002) ''History of the Canadian People:  1867 to Present'', Toronto:  Addison Wesley Longman, p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt;   In January 1950, [[Klaus Fuchs]], who had worked with [[Hans Bethe]] and [[John von Neumann]] while at the Manhattan Project, confessed that he had spied for Stalin.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Goldman (July 2005), "Who Is Trying to Keep What Secret from Whom and Why?  MI5-FBI Relations and the Klaus Fuchs Case", ''Journal of Cold War Studies'', 7 (3):124-146, at 130-131, doi:10.1162/1520397054377160 , ISSN 15313298 .&lt;/ref&gt;  Gouzenko's defection "awakened the people of North America to the magnitude and the danger of Soviet espionage."&lt;ref&gt;[[Granville Hicks]] (July 18, 1954), "Decline and Fall of a Russian Idol", ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Corruption==  
[[Harry S Truman]] had asked for [[J.

{{History of Bahrain}}
The '''March Intifada''' ({{lang-ar|انتفاضة مارس}}) was an [[Rebellion|uprising]] that broke out in [[Bahrain]] in March 1965. The uprising was led by  [[Leftist]] groups, the [[National Liberation Front - Bahrain]] calling for the end of the [[United Kingdom|British]] presence in Bahrain and numerous notable individuals participated in the uprising, including [[Wa'ad]] political activist [[Ali Rabea]].&lt;ref name="bh"/&gt; The uprising was sparked by the laying-off of hundreds of Bahraini workers at the [[Bahrain Petroleum Company]] on March 5, 1965. Several people died in the sometimes violent clashes between protesters and police.

==Background and main events==
The uprising started when students of Manama High School, which then was the only high school in Bahrain, protested against the laying-off of hundreds of workers at BAPCO (Bahrain Petroleum Company), however, the protest was quickly suppressed by the infantry. The news of the crackdown created a nationwide uprising which would last for a month.&lt;ref name="bh"/&gt;

The uprising's motto was "Down down colonialism" ([[Arabic]]: يسقط يسقط الاستعمار)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-8uAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%D9%8A%D8%B3%D9%82%D8%B7+%D9%8A%D8%B3%D9%82%D8%B7+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%86&amp;dq=%D9%8A%D8%B3%D9%82%D8%B7+%D9%8A%D8%B3%D9%82%D8%B7+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%86&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8aqqU_PmIsrE7Aa4w4G4BQ&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA|title=كلمة أخيرة: مقالات صحفية|work=al-Shaer, Sawsan|year=2007|pages=|quote=}} Published by the ''Shaikh Ibrahim bin Mohammed Al Khalifa Centre for Culture and Research''. {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of Muharraq in the uprising===
Muharraq was a strong center of protests. The opposition managed to control the city for a few days, however, security forces entered it after clashes with residents. The people of Muharraq's resistance gave the city the nickname "[[Port Said]]", named after the Egyptian city that became famous during the 1956 tripartite aggression.&lt;ref name="bh"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110311121030/http://bahrainscholars.org/en/?page_id=27 BahrainScholars (Archived)]{{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deaths===
On April 14, 1965, a civilian named Faisal Algassab was the first person to be killed as a result of participation in the Intifada. He was being chased by armed police officer Ahmad Alkhaloo who shot Algassab as he was returning to his residence, causing Algassab to scream in anguish, catching the attention of onlookers and spurring a large crowd at the scene. The officer continued to shoot Algassab until he was presumed dead, causing his blood to be splattered on the walls of his house.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080506175711/http://www.aldemokrati.org/ar-BH/ViewArticle/6/1252/Articles.aspx Al-demokrati (Archived)] {{ar icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five other individuals were killed due to participation in the protests, including Abdullah Saeed Alghanim, Jassim Khalil Abdullah, Abdullah Hussain Bunawda, Abdulnabi Sarhan, and Abdullah Marhoon.

'''Marcius Agrippa''' ([[floruit|fl.]] late 2nd/early 3rd century) was originally a slave serving as a [[beautician]]. He later became a [[freedman]] in some unknown way and then (illegally) started to encroach upon the rank of [[Equestrian (Roman)|Equestrian]], serving as ''advocatus fisci'' (an important official of the imperial treasury) during the reign of [[Septimius Severus]].  His impersonation of a man of higher rank was discovered shortly afterwards, and the emperor exiled him to an island.  He was called back to Rome by the emperor [[Caracalla]], probably given a grant of ''[[ingenui]]tas'', (i.e., an official declaration that he had the rights and legal status of one who had been born free) and he was elevated to [[Roman Senate|senator]]ial rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Reinhold  | first = Meyer  | |author2=[[American Philological Association]]   | title = Studies in Classical History and Society  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]  | date = 2002  | location = Oxford  | pages = 34  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NbM3Ghoo3soC | isbn = 0-19-514543-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was appointed by the emperor [[Macrinus]] in 217, first to the government of [[Pannonia]] and afterwards to that of [[Dacia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], lxxix. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Smith  | first = William Smith  | author-link = William Smith (lexicographer)  | contribution = Agrippa, Marcius  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 78  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0087.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agrippa is almost certainly the same person as the Marcius Agrippa, Roman admiral (likely of the [[classis Misenensis|Misenum fleet]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Botsford  | first = George Willis  | title = The Development of the Athenian Constitution  | publisher = [[Cornell University Press]]  | date = 1941  | location = Ithaca  | pages = 192  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lpQLAAAAIAAJ  | isbn = 0-8371-7918-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is mentioned by [[Augustan History|the Augustan histories]] "as privy to the death of [[Caracalla|Antoninus Caracallus]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Spartianus]], ''Anton.

'''[[Melodifestivalen]] 2007''' was the selection for the 47th song to represent [[Sweden]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It was the 46th time that this system of picking a song has been used. Five semifinals took place to select the ten songs for the final, in [[Jönköping]], [[Gothenburg]], [[Örnsköldsvik]], [[Gävle]] and a Second Chance round in [[Nyköping]]. The final was broadcast on [[SVT1]], [[SVT Europa]], [[YLE FST5]] and [[Sveriges Radio]]'s [[SR P4|P4 network]]. The pre-contest favourites were [[The Ark (Swedish band)|The Ark]], with ''[[The Worrying Kind]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/7928 The Ark for Helsinki?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312120406/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/7928 |date=2007-03-12 }} esctoday.com&lt;/ref&gt; and they won, scoring the highest marks with both juries and televoters. [[The Ark (Swedish band)|The Ark]] also received the highest number of televotes a song had ever achieved in Melodifestivalen at the time, beating [[Carola Häggkvist|Carola]]'s record from [[Melodifestivalen 2006]]. The record was later broken by [[Loreen (singer)|Loreen]] at [[Melodifestivalen 2012]].

==Semifinals==
The '''semifinals for Melodifestivalen 2007''' began on 3 February 2007. There were five semifinals in [[Jönköping]], [[Gothenburg]], [[Örnsköldsvik]], [[Gävle]] and [[Nyköping]] (second chance round) leading up to the final at the [[Ericsson Globe|Globen]] on 10 March 2007.

==Preselection==

The deadline for the submission of songs was 19 September 2006, and 3,234 songs were submitted [https://web.archive.org/web/20120319205434/http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=47345&amp;a=665915&amp;lid=puff_665915&amp;lpos=rubrik], falling short of the [[Melodifestivalen 2006|2006]] record. The titles and composers of the 28 semifinalists (the exceptions being the wildcards) were announced on October 10, 2006. "More Than A Girl", composed by Ulf Lindström, [[Agnes Carlsson]] and Johan Ekhé was disqualified on October 13, 2006, as Carlsson had publicly stated that she had composed the song, which could have affected the impartiality of the jury [https://web.archive.org/web/20120319205600/http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=47345&amp;a=680308&amp;lid=puff_680308&amp;lpos=bild]. "Alla kan bli stjärnor" was disqualified on October 16, 2006, as one of the composers, Sebastian Fronda, refused to sing the song in the competition [https://web.archive.org/web/20120319205617/http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=47345&amp;a=681502&amp;lid=puff_681767]. The two disqualified songs were replaced by "Allt vi en gång trodde på" and "Cara mia". On 1 November 2006, [[Kristian Luuk]] was confirmed as host for all six rounds of the competition. The performers of the first 28 selected songs were announced on 28 November 2006. The wildcards were announced on 26 December 2006 – they were [[Uno Svenningsson|Uno]] &amp; [[Irma Schultz Keller|Irma]], [[The Ark (Swedish band)|The Ark]], [[Sebastian Karlsson (singer)|Sebastian Karlsson]] and [[Magnus Uggla]].

===Changes to Second Chance round===

On 15 August 2006 [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] announced that the Second Chance round, which had traditionally taken place on the Sunday after the last semifinal, would be turned into a full Saturday night show [https://web.archive.org/web/20120204070255/http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=47345&amp;a=637174&amp;lid=puff_637174&amp;lpos=bild]. This means that Melodifestivalen 2007 will be a six-week competition, rather than the five-week event it has been in recent years.

As well as turning the Second Chance round into a main show in an arena, the voting for it has also been changed. A knock-out system will be introduced whereby each of the eight artists are split into four groups of two, and the voters can vote for their favourite in each pair. The four winners go through to a second round, where they will be paired off again, with the winners of each pairing going through to the final.

==Semifinal 1 – [[Jönköping]]==
The first semifinal of Melodifestivalen 2007 took place in [[Kinnarps Arena]] in [[Jönköping]] on 3 February 2007.

'''''Mickey's Gala Premier''''' is a [[Walt Disney]] [[Animation|cartoon]] produced in 1933, directed by [[Burt Gillett]], and featuring parodies of several famous [[Hollywood]] film actors from the 1930s.

Some sources claim this cartoon is called ''"Mickey's Gala [[Premiere]]"''. However ''"[[Premier]]"'' can be clearly read from the title card.

==Synopsis==
A new [[Mickey Mouse]] cartoon will have its premiere in the [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]]. Several Hollywood celebrities all arrive in [[limousine]]s to attend this special event. Outside [[The Keystone Cops]] ([[Ben Turpin]], [[Ford Sterling]], [[Mack Swain]], [[Harry Langdon]] and [[Chester Conklin]]) are guarding the traffic.

[[Wallace Beery]], [[Marie Dressler]], [[Lionel Barrymore]], [[John Barrymore]] and [[Ethel Barrymore]] step out of the first limousine, all costumed as in the film ''[[Rasputin and the Empress]]'' (1932). Then [[Laurel and Hardy]] leave the car and close the door behind them. Inside [[The Marx Brothers]] all stick their heads out of the car window.

In the next scene [[Maurice Chevalier]], [[Eddie Cantor]] costumed as in the film ''[[The Kid from Spain]]'', and [[Jimmy Durante]] take turns singing in front of a [[microphone]]. They are followed by [[Jean Harlow]], [[Joan Crawford]] costumed as in the film ''[[Rain (1932 film)|Rain]]'' and [[Janet Gaynor]] all singing new lyrics to the chant. Finally [[Harold Lloyd]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Edward G. Robinson]], and [[Adolphe Menjou]] join in to conclude the song.

[[Sid Grauman]] is saluting all the guests. [[George Arliss]] and [[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]] simply enter, but [[Charlie Chaplin]] sneaks inside. Then [[Buster Keaton]] enters the building, followed by The Marx Brothers all hidden under [[Groucho Marx]]' coat. [[Mae West]] enters, costumed as in the film ''[[She Done Him Wrong]]'', and utters her famous line, "Why don't you come up sometime and see me?", which shocks and embarrasses Grauman.

Then [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Minnie Mouse]], [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]], [[Horace Horsecollar]], and [[Clarabelle Cow]] arrive in a limousine and are cheered by the audience. Once inside the theatre Mickey’s new cartoon, ''Gallopin' Romance'', premieres. The plot revolves around Mickey and Minnie playing music together, when suddenly [[Pegleg Pete]] kidnaps Minnie and drives off on a horse (Horace Horsecollar). Mickey chases him and beats Pete in the end, bringing Minnie to safety.

All the guests in the theatre move rhythmically to the music. We can see [[Helen Hayes]], [[William Powell]], [[Chester Morris]], [[Gloria Swanson]], and [[George Arliss]] in the audience. In the next close-up scenes the viewer can identify [[Jimmy Durante]], [[Wallace Beery]], [[Marie Dressler]], [[Rudy Vallee]], Eddie Cantor, [[Joan Crawford]], [[Will H. Hays]] (dressed as a [[king]] in reference to his position as ''“[[Censorship]] [[Czar]]”'') and [[Myrna Loy]]. [[Ed Wynn]], [[Wheeler &amp; Woolsey]], [[Laurel &amp; Hardy]] all laugh with the cartoon. [[Bela Lugosi]] (dressed as [[Count Dracula]]), [[Fredric March]] (dressed as [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Mr. Hyde]]) and [[Boris Karloff]] (dressed as [[Frankenstein's monster]]) do the same, but with spooky [[evil laughter]]. [[Joe E. Brown (comedian)|Joe E. Brown]] laughs so loud that his enormous mouth opens wide, while [[Buster Keaton]] keeps his [[Glossary of poker terms#poker face|poker face]]. [[Jimmy Durante]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks]] laugh so loud that they literally "roll in the aisles". They are joined in by Groucho Marx, Joe E. Brown, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and Laurel and Hardy. As the cartoon ends the whole audience applauds and congratulates Mickey with his success. But Mickey is so shy that he has to be pulled on the stage by [[Will Rogers]] with a rope. All the Hollywood actors now shake Mickey’s hands (and feet!) to congratulate him with his success. Then [[Greta Garbo]], no longer wanting to be alone, walks onto the stage and starts covering Mickey’s face with kisses. Mickey wakes up in his bed, while Pluto is licking his face. Mickey wonders if he was dreaming.

Other Hollywood celebrities that can be spotted in the crowd scenes: [[Constance Bennett]], [[Warner Baxter]], and [[Walt Disney]] (as the fourth person on the right, in the scene where the other actors shy away because Garbo enters the stage).

==Production notes==
* The cartoon seen in the film, [[Gallopin’ Romance]], was made exclusively for ''Mickey’s Gala Premiere''. No separate Mickey Mouse cartoon features this title.
* [[Ed Wynn]] would later play [[The Mad Hatter]] in ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''  (1951) and Uncle Albert in the Disney film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964) and [[Maurice Chevalier]] would later sing the theme song of the Disney film ''[[The Aristocats]]'' (1970), both would go on to be named a [[Disney Legend]], an award given to those who have made an outstanding contribution to The Walt Disney Company.
*[[Adolphe Menjou]] would make his last film performance in the Disney film ''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'' (1960).
* [[Helen Hayes]] would later play Grandma Steinmetz in the Disney film ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'' (1974).
* This the first time Mickey interacts with humans.
*At this point in time, the Mickey shorts were released through [[United Artists]], but the only currently existing prints of this short are reissue prints that omit any mention of UA.  However, the "titles" for the short-within-a-short ''Gallopin’ Romance'' still exist in their original form, with the UA credits.  This gives today's viewer an idea on what an opening of a Mickey Mouse cartoon might have looked like in the UA era.

== Temporary shutdown of BBC Television Service ==
On 1 September 1939, ''Mickey’s Gala Premiere'' was the final programme broadcast by the BBC Television Service (today's [[BBC One]]) before it ceased broadcasting during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tbs.pm/9262|title=Au Revoir, Television|last=Thomson|first=Ernest C|date=1 September 2016|website=Transdiffusion|access-date=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[urban legend]] about this final broadcast claims that due to the sudden outbreak of the war the BBC cut the cartoon short, and when BBC-TV resumed after the conflict, it was picked up at the very point it had been interrupted.

Despite this widespread belief, the cartoon was shown in its entirety and then followed by tuning signals. On 7 June 1946, the day BBC television broadcasts resumed after the war, ''Mickey’s Gala Premiere'' was shown again.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thetvroom.com/ark/listings/listing-343.html The TV Room Plus: TV Listings&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120715225756/http://tvlistings.thetvroomplus.com/listing-343.html |date=2012-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
Little or no Etruscan evidence for Nortia survives. Her name is not among those of the deities on the [[Liver of Piacenza]].&lt;ref&gt;Luisa Banti, ''Etruscan Cities and Their Culture'' (University of California Press, 1973, originally published 1968 in Italian), p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; She appears a few times in [[Latin literature]] and inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Evidence gathered by Karl Otfried Müller, ''Die Etrusker'' (Stuttgart, 1877), vol. 3, pp. 52–53 [https://books.google.com/books?id=hn4bAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=%22vor+allen+andern+Gottheiten+die+Nortia%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=uJbYTMjsGMKanAfX9JzmCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online.] Unless otherwise noted, ancient sources given in this article are those listed by Müller.&lt;/ref&gt; She is mentioned in one of [[Juvenal]]'s satires and [[interpretatio romana|identified with]] the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman goddess]] Fortuna,&lt;ref&gt;Scholion to [[Juvenal]], ''Satire'' 10.74.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martianus Capella]] lists her along with other goddesses of fate and chance such as [[Sors]], [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]], and [[Tyche]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Martianus Capella]] 1.88, the "Betrothal" book of ''The Marriage of Philology and Mercury'': "And then the most talkative of girls came flaunting and jumping about with nimble lightness, constantly unstable, extravagant now one way, now the other; some call her [[Sors]], some [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]], many [[Tyche]], and others Nortia," English translation by William Harris Stahl with E.L. Burge, ''Martianus Capella and the Seven Liberal Arts: The Marriage of Philology and Mercury'' (Columbia University Press, 1977), vol. 2, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]] names Nortia twice in [[Christian apologetics|Christian polemic]].&lt;ref&gt;Once when he protests that the Romans permit [[freedom of religion]] to other people, but not to Christians, and gives the Volsinian cult of Nortia as an example of a freely practiced religion (''Apologeticus'' 24; see also ''"[[Religio licita]]")''. Elsewhere Nortia appears in a catalogue of deities Tertullian mocks because he finds them pointlessly obscure (''Ad nationes'' 2.8).&lt;/ref&gt;

A name has been deciphered as possibly Nortia among those of other deities in an [[epigraphy|inscription]] found within an [[Umbri]]an sanctuary at the [[Villa Fidelia]], [[Hispellum]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Bradley, ''Ancient Umbria: State, Culture, and Identity in Central Italy from the Iron Age to the Augustan Era'' (Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 100 and 201, citing F. Coarelli, "La Romanizacion de Umbria," in ''La Romanizacion en Occidente'', edited by J. Blázquez and J. Alvar (Madrid, 1996), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th-century writer and [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Avienus]], who was from Nortia's seat in Volsinii, addressed the goddess in a devotional inscription:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nortia, I venerate you, I who sprang from a Volsinian ''[[Lares|lar]]'',&lt;ref&gt;The ''lar'' was a household deity, used here as a [[metonymy]] for one's home or place of birth.&lt;/ref&gt; living now at Rome, boosted by the honor of a doubled term as [[proconsul]], crafting many poems, leading a guilt-free life, sound for my age, happy with my marriage to Placida and jubilant about our serial fecundity in offspring. May the spirit be vital for those things which, as arranged by the law of the fates, remain to be carried out.&lt;ref&gt;[[Teuffel]], ''History of Latin Literature'' (English edition of 1892), vol. 2, p. 362, citing ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' 6.537 (= ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' 2944). See also [[Jacob Burckhardt]], ''The Age of Constantine the Great'' (University of California Press, 1949, reprinted 1983), pp. 129–130. In Latin:&lt;br&gt;''Nortia, te veneror, lare cretus Vulsiniensi,&lt;br&gt;Romam habitans, gemin[o] proconsulis auctus honor[e]&lt;br&gt; carmina multa serens, v[i]tam insons, integer aevum,&lt;br&gt;coniugio laetus Placidae numeroq[u]e frequenti&lt;br&gt;natorum exsultans. Vivax sit spiritus ollis&lt;br&gt;cetera composita fato[r]um lege trahentur.''&lt;br&gt;Text as construed by J. Mangas and D Plácido, ''Avieno: Ora martima: Descriptio orbis terrae; Phaenomena'' (Ediciones Historia, 2000), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ancient location of Volsinii is vexed, and the Etruscan town was refounded by the Romans. At [[Bolsena]], the most likely candidate for the new Volsinii, there is a ruin outside the Florence gate that is known locally as the ''Tempio di Norzia'', but as [[George Dennis (explorer)|George Dennis]] pointed out in the 19th century, no evidence other than the existence of the cult of Nortia supports this identification, and the [[Ancient Roman architecture|architecture is Roman]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George Dennis (explorer)|George Dennis]], ''The Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria'', (London, 1878), vol. 2, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ritual of the nail==
Nortia's attribute was a nail,&lt;ref&gt;For other ritual practices involving a nail, see [[Curse tablet]].&lt;/ref&gt; which was driven into a wall within her temple at [[Volsinii]] annually to mark the [[New Year]]. The [[Roman historiography|Roman historian]] [[Livy]] took note of the ritual:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Cincius]], an industrious researcher of [[antiquarian]] matters, confirms that at Volsinii nails are in evidence at the temple of the Etruscan goddess Nortia, fixed to mark the number of years.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'' 7.3.7: ''Volsiniis quoque clavos indices numeri annorum fixos in templo Nortiae, Etruscae deae, comparere diligens talium monumentorum auctor Cincius adfirmat''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ritual seems to "nail down" the fate of the people for the year. [[Cicero]] refers to a form of timekeeping in which the nail of the year is to be moved ''(clavum anni movebis)''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Ad Atticum'' 4.14.&lt;/ref&gt; In context, the reference is probably to ''[[parapegma]]ta'', calendars in which the day is marked by the moving of a peg. Some extant [[Roman calendar]]s in stone or metal have holes for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Daryn Lehoux, ''Astronomy, Weather, and Calendars in the Ancient World: Parapegmata and Related Texts in Classical and Near Eastern Societies'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

H.S. Versnel conjectured that the ritual of the nail was associated with the annual meeting of the [[Etruscan league]], and that Nortia's consort could have been [[Voltumna]], the counterpart of Roman [[Vertumnus|Vortumnus]]. The rite is analogous to, or a borrowed precedent for, a similar ritual at Rome originally held in the [[Temple of Capitoline Jupiter]], near a statue of [[Minerva]].&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Versnel, ''Triumphus: An Inquiry into the Origin, Development and Meaning of the Roman Triumph'' (Brill, 1970), pp. 274–276, 295. This view is shared by Simon, "Gods in Harmony," p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Nortia may thus have been related to the Etruscan [[Menerva]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon, "Gods in Harmony," p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  At Rome, the goddess [[Necessitas]], the divine [[personification]] of necessity, was also depicted with a nail, "the adamantine nail / That grim Necessity drives," as described by the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan poet]] [[Horace]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace]], ''Carmen'' 3.24.5 in the translation of David Ferry, ''The Odes of Horace'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1997), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; In a poem addressing [[Fortuna]] and acknowledging her power over all, from the lowliest to the highest,&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Carmen'' 1.35.&lt;/ref&gt; Horace pictures Necessity carrying nails large enough to drive into wooden beams, and [[Wedge (mechanical device)|wedges]].&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Carmen'' 1.35.16–17, ''clauos trabalis et cuneos manu''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual of the nail illuminates the otherwise puzzling [[iconography]] on the back of an [[Corpus Speculorum Etruscorum|Etruscan]] [[bronze mirror]]. [[Meleager]] is depicted under the wings of another Etruscan goddess of fate, identified by inscription as ''Athrpa'', the counterpart of the Greek fate goddess [[Atropos]] who is one of the three [[Moirai]]. Athrpa holds a hammer in her right hand and a nail in her left. With Meleager is his beloved [[Atalanta]] (both names given in the [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan spelling]]), who will be parted by his death in a boar hunt presaged at the top of the composition. [[Turan (mythology)|Turan]] and [[Atunis]] (the Etruscan [[Aphrodite#Adonis|Venus and Adonis]] myth) also appear, as another couple whose love is destroyed by the savagery of the hunt. The hammer ready to drive in the nail symbolizes "the inexorability of human fate."&lt;ref&gt;Simon, "Gods in Harmony," pp. 52–52, with line drawing of mirror on p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Seymour Conway|R.S. Conway]] compared Nortia to the [[Adriatic Veneti|Venetic]] goddess Rehtia, whose name seems to be the [[Venetic language|Venetic]] equivalent of Latin ''rectia'', "right, correct." Bronze nails finely inscribed with dedications were found within a temple precinct thought to have been that of Rehtia at [[Ateste]] (modern [[Este, Italy|Este]]). The heads of the nails have links that attach them to small objects or charms, perhaps the "wedges of necessity" that Horace said Fortuna carried. Rehtia has been seen as a counterpart of the Roman Iustitia, the divine embodiment of [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ius|justice]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Seymour Conway|R.S. Conway]] was preoccupied with Rehtia at the beginning of the 20th century; see his article "Italy (Ancient)" in the ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics'' (1915), vol. 7, p. 461; "The Pre-Hellenic Inscriptions of Praesos," ''Annual of the British School at Athens'' 8 (1901–1902), p. 147; "Some Votive Offerings to the Venetic Goddess Rehtia," ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'' 46 (1916). The name appears variously in dedicatory inscriptions.&lt;/ref&gt; or the Greek goddesses [[Themis]] or [[Dike (mythology)|Dikē]].&lt;ref&gt;"Proceedings for September 1904," ''Transactions and proceedings of the American Philological Association'' 35 (1904), p. xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nuclear weapons}}
'''Nuclear fallout''', or '''fallout''', is the residual radioactive material propelled into the upper atmosphere following a [[nuclear explosion|nuclear blast]], so called because it "falls out" of the sky after the explosion and the [[shock wave]] have passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/Effects/effects17.shtml|title=Radioactive Fallout {{!}} Effects of Nuclear Weapons {{!}} atomicarchive.com|website=www.atomicarchive.com|access-date=2016-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It commonly refers to the [[radioactive]] dust and ash created when a [[nuclear weapon]] explodes.  Fallout is usually limited to the immediate area, and can only spread for hundreds of miles from the explosion site if the explosion is high enough in the atmosphere. Fallout may get [[Entrainment (meteorology)|entrained]] with the products of a [[pyrocumulus]] cloud and fall as black rain&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atomicbombmuseum.org/3_radioactivity.shtml|title=AtomicBombMuseum.org - Destructive Effects|website=atomicbombmuseum.org|access-date=2016-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; (rain darkened by soot and other particulates).

This radioactive dust, usually consisting of [[fission product]]s mixed with bystanding atoms that are [[neutron activation|neutron activated by exposure]], is a highly dangerous kind of [[radioactive contamination]].

==Types of fallout==
[[Image:Radiocarbon bomb spike.svg|thumb|right|Atmospheric nuclear weapon tests almost doubled the concentration of radioactive [[Carbon-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], before levels slowly declined following the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]].]]

An [[air burst]] (that is, a nuclear detonation far above the surface) can produce fallout across whole regions, countries or worldwide, but the longer it travels, the weaker it becomes.  A [[ground burst]] can produce much more severe, local fallout.

===Global fallout===
After an [[air burst]], [[Nuclear fission|fission]] products, un-fissioned nuclear material, and weapon residues vaporized by the heat of the fireball condense into a fine suspension of small particles 10 [[nanometre|nm]] to 20 [[micrometre|µm]] in diameter. These particles may be quickly drawn up into the [[stratosphere]], particularly if the explosive yield exceeds 10 [[kiloton|kt]].

Initially little was known about the dispersion of nuclear fallout on a global scale. The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|AEC]] assumed that fallout would be dispersed evenly across the globe by atmospheric winds and gradually settle to the Earth's surface after weeks, months, and even years as worldwide fallout.

The radio-biological hazard of worldwide fallout is a long-term one because of the potential accumulation of long-lived [[radionuclide|radioisotopes]] (such as [[strontium-90]] and [[caesium-137]]) in the body as a result of ingestion of foods containing the radioactive materials. Because they are dispersed, levels of these isotopes are small for individual nuclear events. Local fallout is more concentrated and of far more immediate concern.

===Local fallout===
In a land or water [[ground burst|surface burst]], heat [[vapor]]izes large amounts of earth or water, which is drawn up into the [[mushroom cloud|radioactive cloud]]. This material becomes radioactive when it condenses with [[fission products]] and other radiocontaminants that have become [[neutron activation|neutron-activated]]. The table below summarizes the abilities of common isotopes to form fallout. Some radiation taints large amounts of land and [[drinking water]] causing formal [[mutation]]s throughout animal and human life.

[[Image:US fallout exposure.png|right|thumb|Per capita [[thyroid]] doses in the continental United States resulting from all exposure routes from all atmospheric [[nuclear testing|nuclear tests]] conducted at the [[Nevada Test Site]] from 1951-1962.]]
A surface burst generates large amounts of particulate matter, composed of particles from less than 100 [[nanometre|nm]] to several millimeters in diameter—in addition to very fine particles that contribute to worldwide fallout. The larger particles spill out of the stem and cascade down the outside of the fireball in a downdraft even as the cloud rises, so fallout begins to arrive near [[ground zero]] within an hour. More than half the total bomb debris lands on the ground within about 24 hours as local fallout. Chemical properties of the elements in the fallout control the rate at which they are deposited on the ground. Less volatile elements deposit first.

Severe local fallout contamination can extend far beyond the blast and thermal effects, particularly in the case of high yield surface detonations. The ground track of fallout from an explosion depends on the weather from the time of detonation onwards. In stronger winds, fallout travels faster but takes the same time to descend, so although it covers a larger path, it is more spread out or diluted. Thus, the width of the fallout pattern for any given dose rate is reduced where the downwind distance is increased by higher winds. The total amount of activity deposited up to any given time is the same irrespective of the wind pattern, so overall casualty figures from fallout are generally independent of winds. But [[thunderstorm]]s can bring down activity as [[rain]] more rapidly than dry fallout, particularly if the [[mushroom cloud]] is low enough to be below ("washout"), or mixed with ("rainout"), the thunderstorm.

Whenever individuals remain in a [[radioactive contamination|radiologically contaminated]] area, such contamination leads to an immediate external radiation exposure as well as a possible later internal hazard from inhalation and ingestion of radiocontaminants, such as the rather short-lived [[iodine-131]], which is accumulated in the [[thyroid]].

==Factors affecting fallout==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:1957.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Nevada nuclear test total fallout outdoor gamma doses, 1950–57. The fallout is to the north and east because testing was only allowed when the wind was blowing in those directions.]] --&gt;

===Location===
There are two main considerations for the location of an explosion: height and surface composition. A nuclear weapon detonated in the air, called an [[air burst]], produces less fallout than a comparable explosion near the ground.

In case of water surface bursts, the particles tend to be rather lighter and smaller, producing less local fallout but extending over a greater area. The particles contain mostly [[sea salt]]s with some water; these can have a [[cloud seeding]] effect causing local [[rainout]] and areas of high local fallout. Fallout from a [[seawater]] burst is difficult to remove once it has soaked into [[porous]] surfaces because the fission products are present as metallic [[ion]]s that chemically bond to many surfaces. Water and detergent washing effectively removes less than 50% of this chemically bonded activity from [[concrete]] or [[steel]]. Complete decontamination requires aggressive treatment like [[sandblasting]], or acidic treatment. After the ''Crossroads'' underwater test, it was found that wet fallout must be immediately removed from ships by continuous water washdown (such as from the [[fire sprinkler]] system on the decks).

Parts of the sea bottom may become fallout. After the [[Castle Bravo]] test, white dust—contaminated [[calcium oxide]] particles originating from pulverized and [[calcination|calcined]] [[coral]]s—fell for several hours, causing [[beta burn]]s and radiation exposure to the inhabitants of the nearby atolls and the crew of the ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru]]'' fishing boat. The scientists called the fallout ''Bikini snow''.

For subsurface bursts, there is an additional phenomenon present called "[[base surge]]". The base surge is a cloud that rolls outward from the bottom of the subsiding column, which is caused by an excessive density of dust or water droplets in the air. For underwater bursts, the visible surge is, in effect, a cloud of liquid (usually water) droplets with the property of flowing almost as if it were a homogeneous fluid. After the water evaporates, an invisible base surge of small radioactive particles may persist.

For subsurface land bursts, the surge is made up of small solid particles, but it still behaves like a [[fluid]]. A soil earth medium favors base surge formation in an underground burst. Although the base surge typically contains only about 10% of the total bomb debris in a subsurface burst, it can create larger radiation doses than fallout near the detonation, because it arrives sooner than fallout, before much radioactive decay has occurred.

===Meteorological===
[[Image:Fallout G&amp;D77.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Comparison of fallout gamma dose and dose rate contours for a 1 Mt fission land surface burst, based on DELFIC calculations. Because of radioactive decay, the dose rate contours contract after fallout has arrived, but dose contours continue to grow]]

[[Meteorology|Meteorological]] conditions greatly influence fallout, particularly local fallout. Atmospheric winds are able to bring fallout over large areas. For example, as a result of a ''[[Castle Bravo]]'' surface burst of a 15 Mt thermonuclear device at [[Bikini Atoll]] on March 1, 1954, a roughly cigar-shaped area of the [[Pacific]] extending over 500&amp;nbsp;km downwind and varying in width to a maximum of 100&amp;nbsp;km was severely contaminated. There are three very different versions of the fallout pattern from this test, because the fallout was only measured on a small number of widely spaced Pacific Atolls. The two alternative versions both ascribe the high radiation levels at north [[Rongelap]] to a downwind hotspot caused by the large amount of radioactivity carried on fallout particles of about 50-100 micrometres size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=General Electric Company|author=Howard A. Hawthorne, Editor|title=COMPILATION OF LOCAL FALLOUT DATA FROM TEST DETONATIONS 1945-1962 - EXTRACTED FROM DASA 1251 - Volume II - Oceanic U.S. Tests|date=May 1979| url=http://worf.eh.doe.gov/data/ihp1d/1362e.pdf| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410131321/http://worf.eh.doe.gov/data/ihp1d/1362e.pdf| archivedate=2008-04-10}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Bravo'', it was discovered that fallout landing on the ocean disperses in the top water layer (above the [[thermocline]] at 100 m depth), and the land equivalent dose rate can be calculated by multiplying the ocean dose rate at two days after burst by a factor of about 530. In other 1954 tests, including ''Yankee'' and ''Nectar,'' hotspots were mapped out by ships with submersible probes, and similar hotspots occurred in 1956 tests such as ''Zuni'' and ''Tewa''.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=US Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory|author=Project Officer T. Triffet, P. D. LaRiviere|title=OPERATION REDWING - Project 2.63, Characterization of Fallout - Pacific Proving Grounds, May-July 1956|date=March 1961|url=http://worf.eh.doe.gov/data/ihp1c/0881_a.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410131256/http://worf.eh.doe.gov/data/ihp1c/0881_a.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-10}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the major U.S. '[[DELFIC]]' (Defence Land Fallout Interpretive Code) computer calculations use the natural size distributions of particles in soil instead of the [[afterwind]] sweep-up spectrum, and this results in more straightforward fallout patterns lacking the downwind hotspot.

[[Snow]] and [[rain]], especially if they come from considerable heights, accelerate local fallout. Under special meteorological conditions, such as a local rain shower that originates above the radioactive cloud, limited areas of heavy contamination just downwind of a nuclear blast may be formed.

==Effects==
A wide range of [[biological process|biological]] changes may follow the irradiation of animals. These vary from rapid death following high doses of penetrating whole-body radiation, to essentially normal lives for a variable period of time until the development of delayed radiation effects, in a portion of the exposed population, following low dose exposures.

The unit of actual ''exposure'' is the [[Roentgen (unit)|röntgen]], defined in [[ionisation]]s per unit volume of air. All ionisation based instruments (including [[geiger counter]]s and [[ionisation chamber]]s) measure exposure. However, effects depend on the energy per unit mass, not the exposure measured in air. A deposit of 1 joule per kilogram has the unit of 1 [[gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy). For 1 MeV energy gamma rays, an exposure of 1 röntgen in air produces a dose of about 0.01 gray (1 centigray, cGy) in water or surface tissue. Because of shielding by the tissue surrounding the bones, the [[bone marrow]] only receives about 0.67 cGy when the air exposure is 1 röntgen and the surface skin dose is 1 cGy. Some lower values reported for the amount of radiation that would kill 50% of personnel (the {{LD50}}) refer to bone marrow dose, which is only 67% of the air dose.

===Short term===

The dose that would be lethal to 50% of a population is a common parameter used to compare the effects of various fallout types or circumstances. Usually, the term is defined for a specific time, and limited to studies of acute lethality. The common time periods used are 30 days or less for most small laboratory animals and to 60 days for large animals and humans. The LD&lt;Sub&gt;50&lt;/Sub&gt; figure assumes that the individuals did not receive other injuries or medical treatment.

In the 1950s, the LD&lt;Sub&gt;50&lt;/Sub&gt; for gamma rays was set at 3.5 Gy, while under more dire conditions of war (a bad diet, little medical care, poor nursing) the LD&lt;Sub&gt;50&lt;/Sub&gt; was 2.5 Gy (250 rad). There have been few documented cases of survival beyond 6 Gy. One person at [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] survived a dose of more than 10 Gy, but many of the persons exposed there were not uniformly exposed over their entire body. If a person is exposed in a non-homogeneous manner then a given dose (averaged over the entire body) is less likely to be lethal. For instance, if a person gets a hand/low arm dose of 100 Gy, which gives them an overall dose of 4 Gy, they are more likely to survive than a person who gets a 4 Gy dose over their entire body. A hand dose of 10 Gy or more would likely result in loss of the hand.

The [[fetus]]es of [[pregnant]] women are often more vulnerable to radiation and may [[miscarriage|miscarry]], especially in the first [[Trimester (pregnancy)|trimester]].

One hour after a surface burst, the radiation from fallout in the [[Subsidence crater|crater]] region is 30 grays per hour (Gy/h).{{Clarify|date=February 2008}} Civilian [[dose rate]]s in peacetime range from 30 to 100 µGy per year.

Fallout radiation decays relatively quickly with time. Most areas become fairly safe for travel and decontamination after three to five weeks.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

For [[nuclear weapon yield|yields]] of up to 10 [[kiloton|kt]], prompt radiation is the dominant producer of casualties on the battlefield. Humans receiving an acute incapacitating dose (30 Gy) have their performance degraded almost immediately and become ineffective within several hours. However, they do not die until five to six days after exposure, assuming they do not receive any other injuries. Individuals receiving less than a total of 1.5 Gy are not incapacitated. People receiving doses greater than 1.5 Gy become disabled, and some eventually die.

A dose of 5.3 Gy to 8.3 Gy is considered lethal but not immediately incapacitating. Personnel exposed to this amount of radiation have their cognitive performance degraded in two to three hours,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170125171152/https://ke.army.mil/bordeninstitute/published_volumes/nuclearwarfare/chapter1/chapter1.pdf NUCLEAR EVENTS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES  by the Borden institute.

However, at that point they experience a recovery period and can perform non-demanding tasks for about six days, after which they relapse for about four weeks. At this time they begin exhibiting symptoms of [[radiation poisoning]] of sufficient severity to render them totally ineffective. Death follows at approximately six weeks after exposure, although outcomes may vary.

Late or delayed effects of radiation occur following a wide range of doses and dose rates. Delayed effects may appear months to years after [[irradiation]] and include a wide variety of effects involving almost all tissues or organs. Some of the ''possible'' delayed consequences of radiation injury, with the rates above the background prevalence, depending on the absorbed dose, include [[carcinogenesis]], [[cataract]] formation, chronic [[radiodermatitis]], decreased [[fertility]], and [[genetic mutation]]s.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;{{citation |title=Fallout from Nuclear Weapons Tests and Cancer Risks |publisher=American Scientist | first1=Steven L. | last1=Simon | first2=André | last2=Bouville | first3=Charles E. | last3=Land |volume=94 |issue=1 |pages=48–57 |year=2006|url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/Fallout-PDF }}{{better source|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Baby Tooth Survey]] founded by the husband and wife team of physicians [[Eric Reiss]] and [[Louise Reiss]], was a research effort focused on detecting the presence of [[strontium-90]], a [[carcinogenic|cancer-causing]] radioactive isotope created by the more than 400 atomic tests conducted above ground that is absorbed from water and dairy products into the bones and teeth given its chemical similarity to [[calcium]]. The team sent collection forms to schools in the [[St. Louis, Missouri]] area, hoping to gather 50,000 teeth each year. Ultimately, the project collected over 300,000 teeth from children of various ages before the project was ended in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [https://www.nytimes.com/1959/03/19/archives/teeth-to-measure-fallout.html "Teeth to Measure Fall-Out"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 18, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preliminary results of the Baby Tooth Survey were published in the November 24, 1961, edition of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', and showed that levels of [[strontium 90]] had risen steadily in children born in the 1950s, with those born later showing the most pronounced increases.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Walter. [https://www.nytimes.com/1961/11/25/archives/babies-surveyed-for-strontium-90-ratio-to-calcium-in-bones-is.html "Babies Surveyed for Strontium 90; Ratio to Calcium in Bones Is Discovered to Be Low A survey has shown that pregnant mothers and their unborn children absorb radioactive strontium, as a substitute for calcium, only about 10 per cent of the time"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 25, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; The results of a more comprehensive study of the elements found in the teeth collected showed that children born after 1963 had levels of strontium 90 in their baby teeth that was 50 times higher than that found in children born before large-scale atomic testing began. The findings helped convince U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] to sign the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] with the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Soviet Union]], which ended the above-ground [[nuclear weapons testing]] that created the greatest amounts of atmospheric nuclear fallout.&lt;ref name=Reiss&gt;Hevesi, Dennis. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/science/10reiss.html "Dr. Louise Reiss, Who Helped Ban Atomic Testing, Dies at 90"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The baby tooth survey was a "campaign [that] effectively employed a variety of media advocacy strategies" to alarm the public and "galvanized" support against atmospheric nuclear testing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.668.4804&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Gerl, E. (2014). Scientist-citizen advocacy in the atomic age: A case study of the Baby Tooth Survey, 1958-1963.]&lt;/ref&gt; with putting an end to such testing being commonly viewed as a positive outcome for a myriad of other reasons. The survey could not show then at the time, nor in the decades that have elapsed, that the levels of global strontium-90 or fallout in general, were in any way life-threatening, primarily because "50 times the strontium-90 from ''before'' nuclear testing" is a minuscule number, and multiplication of minuscule numbers results in only a slightly larger minuscule number. Moreover, the [[Radiation and Public Health Project]] which currently retains the teeth has had their stance and publications heavily criticized: A 2003 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' states that the group's work has been controversial and has little credibility with the scientific establishment.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in an April 2014 article in ''Popular Science'', Sarah Fecht explains that the group's work, specifically the widely discussed case of [[cherry-picking]] data to suggest that fallout from the [[Radiation and Public Health Project#Fukushima|2011 Fukushima accident caused infant deaths]] in America, is "[[junk science]]", as despite their papers being peer-reviewed, all independent attempts to corroborate their results return findings that are not in agreement with what the organization suggests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/what-can-we-do-about-junk-science-16674140|title=What Can We Do About Junk Science|date=2014-04-08|publisher=Popular Science|author=Sarah Fecht|accessdate=2014-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization had earlier also tried [[Ernest J. Sternglass#Three Mile Island|to suggest the same thing occurred after the 1979 Three Mile Island]] accident but this was likewise exposed to be without merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Fallout protection==
{{Main|Fallout shelter}}
{{See also|Fallout Protection|Nuclear warfare#Survival|nuclear famine}}
During the [[Cold War]], the governments of the U.S., the USSR, Great Britain, and China attempted to educate their citizens about surviving a nuclear attack by providing procedures on minimizing short-term exposure to fallout. This effort commonly became known as [[Civil Defense]].

Fallout protection is almost exclusively concerned with protection from radiation. Radiation from a fallout is encountered in the forms of [[Radiation#Alpha|alpha]], [[Radiation#Beta|beta]], and [[Radiation#Gamma|gamma]] radiation, and as ordinary clothing affords protection from alpha and beta radiation,&lt;ref name=NWSSD&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|page=44|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; most fallout protection measures deal with reducing exposure to gamma radiation.&lt;ref name=NWSSA&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|page=131|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p926.htm#Message2481}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the purposes of radiation shielding, many materials have a characteristic ''halving thickness'': the thickness of a layer of a material sufficient to reduce gamma radiation exposure by 50%. Halving thicknesses of common materials include: 1&amp;nbsp;cm (0.4&amp;nbsp;inch) of lead, 6&amp;nbsp;cm (2.4&amp;nbsp;inches) of concrete, 9&amp;nbsp;cm (3.6&amp;nbsp;inches) of packed earth or 150&amp;nbsp;m (500&amp;nbsp;ft) of air. When multiple thicknesses are built, the shielding is additive. A practical fallout shield is ten halving-thicknesses of a given material, such as 90&amp;nbsp;cm (36&amp;nbsp;inches) of packed earth, which reduces gamma ray exposure by approximately 1024 times (2&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.derose.net/steve/guides/emergency/hardened.html|title=Halving-thickness for various materials|publisher="The Compass DeRose Guide to Emergency Preparedness - Hardened Shelters"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NWSS2&gt;{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=11–20|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p912.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shelter built with these materials for the purposes of fallout protection is known as a [[fallout shelter]].

=== Personal Protective Equipment  ===
As the nuclear energy sector continues to grow, the international rhetoric surrounding nuclear warfare intensifies, and the ever-present threat of radioactive materials falling into the hands of dangerous people persists, many scientists are working hard to find the best way to protect human organs from the harmful effects of high energy radiation. [[Acute radiation syndrome|Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)]] is the most immediate risk to humans when exposed to [[ionizing radiation]] in dosages greater than around 0.1 [[Gray (unit)|Gy/hr]]. Radiation in the low energy spectrum ([[Alpha Radiation|alpha]] and [[Beta Radiation|beta radiation]]) with minimal penetrating power are unlikely to cause significant damage to internal organs. The high penetrating power of [[Gamma Radiation|gamma]] and [[neutron radiation]], however, easily penetrates the skin and many thin shielding mechanisms to cause cellular degeneration in the stem cells found in bone marrow. While full body shielding in a secure fallout shelter as described above is the most optimal form of radiation protection, it requires being locked in a very thick bunker for a significant amount of time. In the event of a nuclear catastrophe of any kind, it is imperative to have [[Radiation protection#Externally Penetrating Radiation Protective Equipment|mobile protection equipment]] for medical and security personnel to perform necessary containment, evacuation, and any number of other important public safety objectives. The mass of the shielding material required to properly protect the entire body from high energy radiation would make functional movement essentially impossible. This has led scientists to begin researching the idea of partial body protection: a strategy inspired by [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)]]. The idea is to use enough shielding material to sufficiently protect the high concentration of bone marrow in the pelvic region, which contains enough regenerative stem cells to repopulate the body with unaffected bone marrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waterman|first=Gideon|last2=Kase|first2=Kenneth|last3=Orion|first3=Itzhak|last4=Broisman|first4=Andrey|last5=Milstein|first5=Oren|date=29 March 2017|title=Selective Shielding of Bone Marrow: An Approach to Protecting Humans from External Gamma Radiation|url=https://journals.lww.com/health-physics/Abstract/2017/09000/Selective_Shielding_of_Bone_Marrow___An_Approach.4.aspx|journal=The Radiation Safety Journal: Health Physics|volume=113|pages=195–208|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More information on bone marrow shielding can be found in the [https://journals.lww.com/health-physics/pages/default.aspx Health Physics Radiation Safety Journal] article [https://journals.lww.com/health-physics/Abstract/2017/09000/Selective_Shielding_of_Bone_Marrow___An_Approach.4.aspx Selective Shielding of Bone Marrow: An Approach to Protecting Humans from External Gamma Radiation], or in the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)]] and the [[Nuclear Energy Agency|Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA)]]'s 2015 report: [https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/docs/2014/crpph-r2014-5.pdf Occupational Radiation Protection in Severe Accident Management.]

===The Seven Ten Rule===
The danger of radiation from fallout also decreases with time, as radioactivity decays exponentially with time, such that for each factor of seven increase in time, the radiation is reduced by a factor of ten.  For example, after 7 hours, the average [[dose rate]] is reduced by a factor of ten; after 49 hours, it is reduced by a further factor of ten (to 1/100th); after two weeks the radiation from the fallout will have reduced by a factor of 1000 compared the initial level; and after 14 weeks the average dose rate will have reduced to 1/10,000th of the initial level.&lt;ref name=NWSS2 /&gt;

==Nuclear reactor accident==
{{See also|Comparison of Chernobyl and other radioactivity releases}}
Fallout can also refer to [[nuclear accident]]s, although a [[nuclear reactor]] does not explode like a nuclear weapon. The [[isotopic signature]] of bomb fallout is very different from the fallout from a serious power reactor accident (such as [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] or [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima]]).

The key differences are in [[volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] and [[half-life]].

===Volatility===
The [[boiling point]] of an [[chemical element|element]] (or its [[chemical compound|compound]]s) is able to control the percentage of that element a power reactor accident releases. The ability of an element to form a solid controls the rate it is deposited on the ground after having been injected into the atmosphere by a nuclear detonation or accident.

===Half-life===
A [[half life]] is the time it takes half of the radiation of a specific substance to decay. A large amount of short-lived isotopes such as &lt;sup&gt;97&lt;/sup&gt;Zr are present in bomb fallout. This isotope and other short-lived isotopes are constantly generated in a power reactor, but because the [[critical mass|criticality]] occurs over a long length of time, the majority of these short lived isotopes decay before they can be released.

The '''Odeon Theatre''' in [[Christchurch]] was the oldest masonry theatre in New Zealand, and one of only three remaining purpose-built 19th-century theatres in the country. The building has had different names over the years, and was put to many different uses. It was damaged beyond repair in the 22 February [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]] and partially demolished in September 2012. The theatre was recognised as a Category I heritage building by the [[New Zealand Historic Places Trust]], with registration number 3140. One of its most notable aspects was its use as a public meeting venue of [[Kate Sheppard]] during her [[Women's suffrage in New Zealand|women's suffrage]] campaign.

==History==
[[File:Public hall (later St James Theatre).jpg|thumb|left|The original facade of the Tuam Street Hall including a significant parapet (removed in 1960)]]
A syndicate of citizens formed the Public Hall Company Ltd and through this commissioned the building.&lt;ref name="register Odeon"&gt;{{NZHPT|3140|Odeon Theatre|18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Library entry"&gt;{{cite web|title=Public hall (later St James Theatre), Tuam Street, Christchurch |url= http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/Photos/Disc12/IMG0072.asp |publisher=Christchurch City Libraries|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre, located in 214 Tuam Street, was built in 1883 to a design by Thomas Stoddart Lambert (1840–1915).&lt;ref name="register Odeon" /&gt;  It had a capacity of 2,200 people, 600 of whom fitted into the gallery. The stage was initially {{convert|60|ft}} wide and {{convert|40|ft}} deep. The building was opened on 20 July 1883, with the [[Mayor of Christchurch]], [[George Ruddenklau]], presiding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Young Men's Christian Association|url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=TS18830721.2.22 |accessdate=18 September 2012 |newspaper=The Star|date=21 July 1883|issue=4750|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Final curtain for the Odeon Theatre, Christchurch 12.JPG|thumb|left|The final curtain for the Odeon Theatre]]
The building's original name was '''Tuam Street Hall''' or '''Tuam Street Theatre'''. The building had a variety of rather diverse uses: public meeting place, entertainment, exhibitions, roller skate rink, and other activities. In 1893, it was used by [[Kate Sheppard]] for [[Women's suffrage in New Zealand|women's suffrage]].&lt;ref name="register Odeon" /&gt; After the 1893 Electoral Act was passed on 19 September 1893, which meant that New Zealand women were the first in the world to be granted the right to vote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Votes for Women|url= http://www.elections.org.nz/study/education-centre/history/votes-for-women.html|publisher= Elections New Zealand|accessdate= 18 September 2012|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120819080640/http://www.elections.org.nz/study/education-centre/history/votes-for-women.html|archivedate= 19 August 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; an enrolment meeting was held by Sheppard at Tuam Street Hall on 26 September in preparation for the [[New Zealand general election, 1893|1893 election]] in late November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Women's Franchise |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CHP18930926.2.20 |accessdate=18 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Press]] |volume=L |issue=8597 |date=26 September 1893|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite rather unfavourable weather, 600 women were enrolled that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Enrolment Meeting|url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TS18930926.2.37 |accessdate=18 September 2012|newspaper=The Star|date=26 September 1893|issue=4758|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, the name changed to '''Opera House'''. [[Vaudeville]] was the main form of entertainment around the turn of the century, and [[John Fuller (theatre manager)|John Fuller]]'s son Benjamin started their theatre company's involvement with the building in 1903.&lt;ref name="Library entry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DNZB Fuller"&gt;{{DNZB|Downes|Peter |2f29|Fuller, John - Biography|18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sidney and Alfred Luttrell|Sidney Luttrell]] was commissioned to remodel the building's interior, and the modified space opened on 26 December 1927, providing seating for 1,300 people. The dimensions of the stage were changed to {{convert|60|ft}} wide, {{convert|60|ft}} deep, and {{convert|40|ft}} high, and there were then 19 dressing rooms.&lt;ref name="Library entry" /&gt;  With the introduction of film in 1930, the name was once again changed, this time to '''St James'''. The stage remained, though, and the building was sometimes used for other purposes, for example live entertainment.&lt;ref name="Library entry" /&gt; St James closed for a period during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="register Odeon" /&gt; Notable performers during the 1940s include the [[Trapp Family Singers]], [[Stanley Holloway]], [[Johnny Devlin]], [[Laurence Olivier]], and Olivier's second wife [[Vivien Leigh]].&lt;ref name="register Odeon" /&gt;

[[File:Kate Sheppard.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Kate Sheppard]] made extensive use of the Tuam Street Hall during her women's suffrage campaign]]
Ownership changed in 1960 to Kerridge-Odeon Ltd, and the building was renamed '''Odeon''' and reopened on 27 September 1960. Extensive changes were undertaken, including the removal of the parapet, reduction of seating down to 720, updating of the cinema equipment, and introduction of a coffee lounge.&lt;ref name="register Odeon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Library entry" /&gt; Through competition with television, patronage declined and the theatre eventually closed. The building was purchased in 1983 by the [[Sydenham, New Zealand|Sydenham]] Assembly of God, who used it for religious gatherings from 1985.&lt;ref name="register Odeon" /&gt;

The building was bought in 2003 by a group of businessmen, who in May 2004 applied for demolition consent. In response, the Odeon Theatre Trust was formed by residents concerned for the preservation of the building.&lt;ref name="register Odeon" /&gt; Ownership changed again in December 2006, when Property Ventures Ltd, the development company of [[David Henderson (Christchurch, New Zealand)|David Henderson]], purchased it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Solotti|first=Rachel|title=Theatre set to star once again |url= http://www.starcanterbury.co.nz/news/theatre-set-to-star-once-again/971397/  |accessdate=18 September 2012|newspaper=The Star|date=15 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Property Ventures had its office in a building diagonally opposite the Odeon Theatre at 179 Tuam Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Property Ventures|url= http://www.zenbu.co.nz/entry/1112002-property-ventures |publisher=zenbu |accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Henderson's companies got into financial difficulties, [[Christchurch City Council]] controversially bought five of his inner city land holdings in August 2008, but not the Odeon Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Business lobby questions Henderson deals |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/575573 |accessdate=18 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Press]]|date=11 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Odeon Theatre repaired |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/our-communities/659771/Odeon-Theatre-repaired |accessdate=18 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Press]]|date=5 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson was placed in bankruptcy in November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=van Beynen|first=Martin |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/4403232/Property-developer-David-Henderson-placed-in-bankruptcy |title=Property developer David Henderson placed in bankruptcy |authorlink=Martin van Beynen |date=29 November 2010 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SOL Square - Yellow Cross.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Yellow Cross bar in SOL Square, utilising the cross from the Odeon Theatre fitted by the Sydenham Assembly of God]]
During the years of the Sydenham Assembly of God ownership, a large yellow illuminated cross was displayed on the theatre's frontage (the bracket still visible in photos post-2008). Henderson used the cross in the SOL Square development (located on the north side of the Property Ventures head office) and styled one of the bars as the Yellow Cross, prominently displaying the cross on the roof apex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SOL Square |url= https://www.flickr.com/photos/12265809@N07/3034015490/ |publisher=flickr|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Christchurch actor and director [[Mark Hadlow]] campaigned for the Odeon Theatre to be turned into an arts complex for an estimated NZ$60m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gates |first=Charlie |title=Hadlow wants to turn Odeon into NoeDo |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/our-communities/3184268/Hadlow-wants-to-turn-Odeon-into-NoeDo |accessdate=7 February 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heritage listing==
On 26 November 1981, the building was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I historic place, with the registration number 3140. The building is recognised as the once largest public meeting venue in Christchurch, the oldest remaining theatre in Christchurch, and the then country's oldest masonry theatre. Of significance is the use of the building by Kate Sheppard. Another aspect is the building's association with two important Christchurch designers, Lambert and S. Luttrell.&lt;ref name="register Odeon" /&gt;

==Earthquake damage==
The building was severely damaged in the February [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]]. Demolition was ordered by the [[Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority]] in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Heather |first=Ben |title=More Christchurch buildings marked for demolition |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/rebuilding-christchurch/6248855/More-Christchurch-buildings-marked-for-demolition |accessdate=18 September 2012 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September of that year, the rear of the building was demolished.&lt;ref&gt;See photos in Commons category&lt;/ref&gt;  The front of the building is protected by a stack of shipping containers placed in Tuam Street; it is hoped to retain at least the façade of the building, but its future is uncertain; this is still the case as of September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cairns |first=Lois |title=Powerless to stop heritage demolition |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/8014704/Powerless-to-stop-heritage-demolition |accessdate=7 February 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8496">'''The Ritz Theater''' is located in the [[Newburgh (city), New York|city of Newburgh, New York]]. The theater is the last remaining historic theater in the city. The legendary building has a rich history of notable performances, and is being restored by a local nonprofit organization.

==History==

The original structure that would become the home of the Ritz Theater was constructed in 1883 at 107 Broadway in [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh, New York]]. “The address had been the site of other ventures that offered some of life’s small luxuries: George Barnes’ plumbing business ... a cigar factory ... and even a champagne factory.”&lt;ref name="McTamaney"&gt;McTamaney, Mary. “From Cohen’s Opera House to the Ritz Theater.” Mid Hudson Times 3 February 2010, print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1900s==

In 1913, the intended manufacturing building was purchased by George Cohen, “a Poughkeepsie entrepreneur,” and was named Cohen’s Opera House. The opera house opened on February 4, 1913.&lt;ref name="McTamaney" /&gt; The opera house welcomed performers of all arts: jugglers, singers, dance troupes, theater companies, etc.&lt;ref name="McTamaney" /&gt;

The East-West Theater Company became a part of the theater and changed the theater’s name from Cohen’s Opera House to the State Theater in 1926. The State Theater was a major participant in the vaudeville theatrical genre that was extremely popular at the time.

In 1933 Eugene Levy purchased the theater from George Cohen and “converted that playhouse of a gaudier era into an institution where cinematic and variety productions of the highest standard [were] presented with amazing skill, and affording the fascinated beholder the ultimate in comfort and convenience.”&lt;ref&gt;The November News, November 28, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; This would begin a new era for the Ritz Theater, which became a frequent stomping ground of many big name stars such as: [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Louis Prima]], [[Mary Martin]], [[Peggy Lee]], Wood Herman, [[Dick Powell]], Bill “Bojangles” Robinson, Eddy Duchin, [[Red Skelton]], [[Xavier Cugat]], [[The Inkspots]], [[Vaughn Monroe]], Montana Slim, Les Brown, Ricardo Crotez, and many more.

On November 3, 1940, [[Frank Sinatra]], an unknown singer at the time, stepped onto the Ritz Theater’s stage.  The band of Tommy Dorsey backed Sinatra who captivated the Newburgh audience.&lt;ref name="Cronin"&gt;Cronin, Kristen. “Restoration: History.” Ritz Theater. N.p., 12/13/2010. Web. 28 Mar 2011. &lt;http://www.ritztheaternewburgh.org/history/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ritz Theater is most notably famous for being the stage where Lucille Ball made her stage debut. “On December 17th, 1941 she performed for the first time on stage and for the first time with her new husband, Desi Arnaz. It was on the Ritz stage that they planted the seeds for their sitcom, ''I Love Lucy''.”&lt;ref name="Cronin" /&gt;

Shows were brought to the Ritz Theater by New York City’s Paramount Theater to test their acts on the Newburgh audience before opening in New York City.

Although the Ritz Theater continued to show movies, in the 1960s both the City of Newburgh and its once highly popular street of Broadway entered a slow decline that affected the theater as well as the city. The popular city of Newburgh was no longer as frequented as it once was as the ferry closed, and I-84 as well as the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge by-passed the downtown area of Newburgh.

In October 1969, the Ritz Theater was closed, and the theater became a movie house containing two cinemas. Cinemas one and two were carved into the house and the stage was closed and walled off from the rest of the structure. In 1981 both of the cinemas were shut down after “vandals damaged $15,000 worth of seating improvements inside the theater” and the owner of cinemas One and Two, Abram and Eva Levinson, “quit Newburgh ... quietly closing up shop.”&lt;ref&gt;Unknown. “Theater Closes its Doors.” Saturday Record 10/24/1981, Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1999, the movie theater was reopened by a former owner; however, the theater was quickly closed again for good in June of the same year due to lack of business. Throughout this span of seventeen weeks in business, the theater only had 700 customers.&lt;ref name="Cronin" /&gt;

==2000s==
In 2002, the Ritz Theater was purchased by Patricia Haggerty-Wenz, Founder and Executive Director of Safe Harbors of the Hudson, which is a “nonprofit organization that is committed to transforming lives and building communities through housing and the arts in the City of Newburgh.”&lt;ref name="Cronin" /&gt; The organization stumbled upon the theater in the process of restoring the adjacent former Hotel Newburgh, which is now the Cornerstone Residence, a supportive-housing facility. Haggerty-Wenz's mission for the only remaining historic theater in the City of Newburgh, is to “provide a venue for live performances in a city that has none, educational programs for our youth, employment opportunities for our community and to create an active cultural and tourist destination.”&lt;ref name="Haggerty-Wenz"&gt;Haggerty-Wenz, Patricia. “Ritz Theater-Newburgh, Inc. project proposal.” Message to The Anneberg Foundation Radnor Financial Center. 02/10/2009. E-mail.&lt;/ref&gt;

This combination project, according to Haggerty-Wenz, is “the only one in the country that combines the restoration of a historic theater with a supportive housing project, all under one roof.”&lt;ref name="Haggerty-Wenz" /&gt;

With Haggerty-Wenz and Safe Harbors of the Hudson being the new owner of the establishment, the renovation of the Ritz Theater Lobby began. The renovation of the supportive housing project called the Cornerstone Residence adjacent to the theater occurred from 2004-2006.

The Cornerstone Residence consists of 128 apartments; 116 are supportive housing units and twelve are artist lofts. The apartments house a mixed tenancy of single adults, including formerly homeless, veterans, those living with a mental health diagnosis and/or physical disability, artists and other adults who need safe, attractive affordable housing.&lt;ref name="Haggerty-Wenz" /&gt;

In 2008, Safe Harbors of the Hudson created a nonprofit organization called Ritz Theater-Newburgh, Inc. The mission of this particular nonprofit organization was to focus exclusively on the restoration of the Ritz Theater. A new era bloomed within the theater. It began hosting live performances in the newly restored lobby from award-winning musicians such as: Levi Kreiss, Pete Seeger and Odair Assad. The performances were part of the Tom Humphrey Guitar series.

In 2009,  Ritz Theater-Newburgh, Inc. continued providing programming and performances in the restored lobby from artists such as: Bucky Pizzarelli, Arturo O’Farrill, The Michele Ramo Group, Jesse Lege, and many others. As well as providing performances in the lobby, the organization also focused on raising funds to restore the original theater to what it was. In July of the same year, Congressman Maurice Hinchey secured a federal appropriations bill which included “400,000 to begin renovating the Ritz Theater, the last remaining historic theater in Newburgh.”

In 2010, the Tom Humphrey Guitar Series continued to perform featuring artists such as: Larry Coryell, Maria Zemantauski and Duke Robillard. In October and November, Cindy Cashdollar and Frederic Hand performed and the second annual RitzKidz “Newburgh’s Got Talent” Talent Show was held. In February of the same year, the Ritz Theater secured 200,000 dollars in funding from the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal’s Urban Initiatives Program. This funding was directed towards the building of a box office.

==Future==

The completion of the reconstruction of the Ritz Theater is scheduled for 2014. After the theater is finished, it will hold 825 people. There are a few nonprofit performing arts organizations who hope to make the newly renovated Ritz Theater their home; such as: “The Greater Newburgh Symphony Orchestra, the Opera Company of the Highlands and the Newburgh Performing Arts Academy” (Ritz Theater Tour).

The '''Royal Court Theatre''', at different times known as the '''Court Theatre''', the '''New Chelsea Theatre''', and the '''Belgravia Theatre''', is a [[West End Theatre#London's non-commercial theatres|non-commercial West End theatre]] on [[Sloane Square]], in the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]], London, England. In 1956 it was acquired by and remains the home of the [[English Stage Company]] and is notable for its contributions to contemporary theatre.

==History==
===The first theatre===
The first theatre on Lower George Street, off Sloane Square, was the converted Nonconformist '''Ranelagh Chapel''', opened as a theatre in 1870 under the name '''The New Chelsea Theatre'''. [[Marie Litton]] became its manager in 1871, hiring [[Walter Emden]] to remodel the interior, and it was renamed the '''Court Theatre'''.&lt;ref&gt;During mid-1870, it was briefly called the "Belgravia" Theatre, but all of W. S. Gilbert's pieces presented at the theatre, beginning in 1871, were publicised as playing at the "Court Theatre".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Happy Land - Illustrated London News, March 22, 1873.PNG|thumb|left|300px|Scene from ''The Happy Land'', showing the scandalous impersonation of  [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], [[Robert Lowe, 1st Viscount Sherbrooke|Lowe]], and [[Acton Smee Ayrton|Ayrton]]]]
Several of [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s early plays were staged here, including ''[[Randall's Thumb]]'', ''[[Creatures of Impulse]]'' (with music by [[Alberto Randegger]]), ''Great Expectations'' (adapted from the [[Dickens]] novel), and ''On Guard'' (all in 1871); ''[[The Happy Land]]'' (1873, with [[Gilbert Abbott à Beckett]]; Gilbert's most controversial play); ''The Wedding March'', translated from ''Un Chapeau de Paille d'Italie'' by [[Eugène Marin Labiche]] (1873); ''The Blue-Legged Lady'', translated from ''La Dame aux Jambes d'Azur'' by Labiche and Marc-Michel (1874); and ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' (1875).  By 1878, management of the theatre was shared by [[John Hare (actor)|John Hare]] and [[W. H. Kendal]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Further alterations were made in 1882 by Alexander Peebles, after which its capacity was 728 (including stalls and boxes, dress circle and balcony, amphitheatre, and gallery).&lt;ref name=socialhistory&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=28709#s9 ''Social history: Social and cultural activities, A History of the County of Middlesex'']: Volume 12: Chelsea (2004), pp. 166–76. Date accessed: 22 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  After that, [[Arthur Cecil]] (who had joined the theatre's company in 1881) was co-manager of the theatre with John Clayton.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Knight, Joseph, rev. Nilanjana Banerji.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4974 "Cecil, Arthur (1843–1896)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 7 October 2008, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/4974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other works, they produced a series of [[Arthur Wing Pinero]]'s farces, including ''The Rector'', ''The Magistrate'' (1885), ''The Schoolmistress'' (1886), and ''Dandy Dick'' (1887), among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html Profile of the theatre and other Victorian theatres]&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre closed on 22 July 1887 and was demolished.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, ''London Theatres'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The current theatre: 1888–1952===
The present building was built on the east side of Sloane Square, replacing the earlier building, and opened on 24 September 1888 as the '''New Court Theatre'''. Designed by Walter Emden and [[Bertie Crewe]], it is constructed of fine red brick, moulded brick, and a stone facade in free Italianate style. Originally the theatre had a capacity of 841 in the stalls, dress circle, amphitheatre, and a gallery.

Cecil and Clayton yielded management of the theatre to [[Mrs. John Wood]] and Arthur Chudleigh in 1887, although Cecil continued acting in their company (and others) until 1895.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; The first production in the new building was a play by [[Sydney Grundy]] titled ''Mamma'', starring [[Mrs. John Wood]] and John Hare, with [[Arthur Cecil]] and [[Eric Lewis (actor)|Eric Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;"New Court Theatre", ''The Times'', 25 September 1888, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the century, the theatre was again called the "Royal Court Theatre".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/RoyalCourtTheatreLondon.htm#present "The Royal Court Theatre, Sloane Square, London: The New Court Theatre"], ArthurLloyd.co.uk, accessed 19 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harley Granville-Barker]] managed the theatre for the first few years of the 20th century, and [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s plays were produced at the New Court for a period. It ceased to be used as a theatre in 1932, but was used as a [[movie theater|cinema]] from 1935 to 1940, until [[World War II]] bomb damage closed it.&lt;ref name=socialhistory/&gt;

===The English Stage Company===
The interior was reconstructed by Robert Cromie, and the number of seats was reduced to under 500. The theatre re-opened in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Mackintosh and Sell, ''Curtains!!!'', p. 155. See Plate 15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Devine]] was appointed artistic director at the suggestion of [[Oscar Lewenstein]], one of the  founders of the English Stage Company. [[Greville Poke]], another co-founder was appointed Honorary Secretary of the ESC in October 1954.&lt;ref name="The Royal Court Theatre and the Modern Stage"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Philip|title=The Royal Court Theatre and the Modern Stage|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Library|isbn=0521479622|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESC opened at the Royal Court in 1956 as a subsidised theatre producing new British and foreign plays, together with some classical revivals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://royalcourttheatre.com/about/history Royal Court Theatre: History]&lt;/ref&gt; Devine aimed to create a writers' theatre, seeking to discover new writers and produce serious contemporary works. Devine produced the new company's third production  in 1956, [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'', a play by one of the [[angry young men]]. The director was [[Tony Richardson]]. Osborne followed ''Look Back In Anger'' with ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]]'', with [[Laurence Olivier]] in the lead as Archie Rice, a play the actor effectively commissioned from the playwright. Significantly, although it was quickly reversed, the artistic board of the ESC initially rejected the play. Two members of the board were in agreement in opposing ''The Entertainer''. The Conservative Christian verse dramatist [[Ronald Duncan]], the third co-founder of the ESC, disliked the work of Osborne according to Osborne biographer [[John Heilpern]],&lt;ref name="Heilpern216"&gt;John Heilpern [https://books.google.com/books?id=e7hBfYDEupYC&amp;pg=PA216 ''John Osborne: A Patriot for Us''], London: Vintage, 2007 [2006], p.216; [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/mar/06/comedy1 "'It's me, isn't it?'"], ''The Guardian'', 6 March 2007 (extract)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Despite Heilpern's claim, Duncan seems to have recognised the qualities of Look Back in Anger'', see Yael Zarhy-Levo [https://books.google.com/books?id=7_xMBGEEi-kC&amp;pg=PA31 ''The Making of Theatrical Reputations: Studies from the Modern London Theatre''], Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2008, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; while Lewenstein, a former [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist]],&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Robert Murphy [http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=65717&amp;back= "Lewenstein, (Silvion) Oscar (1917–1997)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; did not want one of the theatre's new plays to be overwhelmed by its star and did not think much of the play.&lt;ref name="Heilpern216"/&gt;

In the mid-1960s, the ESC became involved in issues of [[Censorship in the United Kingdom|censorship]]. Their premiere productions of Osborne's ''[[A Patriot for Me]]'' and ''[[Saved (play)|Saved]]'' by [[Edward Bond]] (both 1965) necessitated the theatre turning itself into a 'private members club' to circumvent the [[Lord Chamberlain]], formally responsible for the licensing of plays until the [[Theatres Act 1968]]. The ''[[succès de scandale]]'' of the two plays helped to bring about the abolition of [[Lord Chamberlain's Office#Theatre censorship|theatre censorship]] in the UK.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} During the period of Devine's directorship, besides Osborne and Bond, the Royal Court premiered works by [[Arnold Wesker]], [[John Arden]], [[Ann Jellicoe]] and [[N.F. Simpson]]. Subsequent Artistic Directors of the Royal Court premiered work by [[Christopher Hampton]], [[Athol Fugard]], [[Howard Brenton]], [[Caryl Churchill]], [[Hanif Kureishi]], [[Sarah Daniels]], [[Errol John]], [[Timberlake Wertenbaker]], [[Martin Crimp]], [[Sarah Kane]], [[Sylvia Wynter]], [[Mark Ravenhill]], [[Martin McDonagh]], [[Simon Stephens]], [[Leo Butler]], [[Polly Stenham]] and [[Nick Payne]]. Early seasons included new international plays by [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], and [[Marguerite Duras]]. In addition to the 400-seat [[proscenium arch]] Theatre Downstairs, the much smaller studio Theatre Upstairs was opened in 1969, at the time a 63-seat facility.&lt;ref name=socialhistory/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.behindthearras.com/Reviewspr/reviewsPRJanFeb2010/RockyHorrorG02-10.html 63 seat Theatre Upstairs]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' premiered there in 1973. The theatre was [[listed building|Grade II listed]] in June 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?pid=2&amp;id=423994 English Heritage listing details] accessed 28 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the main auditorium and the façade were attractive, the remainder of the building provided poor facilities for both audience and performers, and the stalls and understage often flooded throughout the 20th century. By the early 1990s, the theatre had deteriorated dangerously and was threatened with closure in 1995. The Royal Court received a grant of £16.2 million from the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] and the [[Arts Council England|Arts Council]] for redevelopment, and beginning in 1996, under the artistic directorship of [[Stephen Daldry]], it was completely rebuilt, except for the façade and the intimate auditorium. The architects for this were [[Haworth Tompkins]]. The theatre reopened in February 2000, with the 380-seat [[Jerwood Foundation|Jerwood]] Theatre Downstairs, and the 85-seat studio theatre, now the Jerwood Theatre Upstairs. Since 1994, a new generation of playwrights debuting at the theatre has included [[Joe Penhall]], [[Sarah Kane]], [[Mark Ravenhill]], [[Roy Williams (playwright)|Roy Williams]] amongst others.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}  Since the 1990s, the Royal Court has placed an emphasis on the development and production of international plays. By 1993, the British Council had begun its support of the International Residency programme (which started in 1989 as the Royal Court International Summer School), and more recently the [[Genesis Foundation (arts charity)|Genesis Foundation]] has also supported the production of international plays. The theatre received a 1999 International Theatre Institute award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/international.asp International Department], Royal Court Theatre&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008 The English Stage Company presented ''The Ugly One'' by [[Marius von Mayenburg]] at the "Contact International Theatre Festival" in [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://teatr.torun.pl/_portal/12084172374806fbd51b077/Kontakt_2008.html Contact International Theatre Festival 2008] accessed 24 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic Directors have included [[Ian Rickson]] (1998–2006), [[Max Stafford-Clark]], [[Stuart Burge]], [[Robert Kidd]], [[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], [[Anthony Page]], and [[William Gaskill]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/about-us/artistic-directors/ Artistic Directors]" since 1956, Royal Court Theatre website&lt;/ref&gt; From 2007 to 2012, the theatre's Artistic Director was [[Dominic Cooke]] and the deputy artistic director was [[Jeremy Herrin]]. [[Vicky Featherstone]], the first female artistic director, previously founding head of the [[National Theatre of Scotland]], replaced Cooke as Artistic Director in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-18041153|title=Royal Court names Vicky Featherstone as Cooke successor|date=11 May 2012|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Dickson [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/may/11/royal-court-vicky-featherstone-artistic-director "Royal Court hires Vicky Featherstone as first female artistic director"], ''The Guardian'', 11 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy over ''Seven Jewish Children''===
[[Caryl Churchill]]'s play ''[[Seven Jewish Children]]'' opened at the theatre in February 2009.  Many Jewish leaders and journalists have criticised ''Seven Jewish Children'' as [[antisemitic]],&lt;ref name=Symons&gt;Symons, Leon.

[http://www.thejc.com/articles/review-seven-jewish-children "Seven Jewish Children",] ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 12 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Associate Director [[Ramin Gray]] has been accused of hypocrisy, as he is reported to have stated that he would be reluctant to stage a play critical of [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Whittle, Peter.

[[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the play as "a heartfelt lamentation for the future generations".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Billington [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/feb/11/seven-jewish-children "Theatre: ''Seven Jewish Children''"], ''The Guardian'', 11 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The paper contended that the play, though controversial, is not antisemitic,&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Higgins [https://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2009/feb/18/israelandthepalestinians-religion "Is Seven Jewish Children anti-semitic?"] ''The Guardian'' (blog), 18 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; yet ''Seven Jewish Children'' was viewed by another ''Guardian'' writer as historically inaccurate and harshly critical of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Romain, Jonathan. [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/feb/20/judaism-theatre "Selective bravery is not very brave"], ''The Guardian'', 20 February 2009. Quote: "...the same standards must apply to all faiths".&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Hoffman, co-vice chairman of the [[Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland]], called the play "a libellous and despicable demonisation of Israeli parents and grandparents" and expressed fear that it would "stoke the fires of [[antisemitism]]". He added that the play is a modern [[blood libel]] drawing on old anti-Semitic myths.&lt;ref name=Symons/&gt; [[Jeffrey Goldberg]] of ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' also calls the play a blood libel.&lt;ref name=Goldberg/&gt; Columnist [[Melanie Phillips]] wrote that the play is "an open vilification of the Jewish people...  drawing upon an atavistic hatred of the Jews" and called it "Open incitement to hatred".&lt;ref name=Symons/&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that the play "at times paints heartless images of Israelis."&lt;ref name=Pat/&gt;

In reply, the Royal Court issued the following statement:
{{quote|Some concerns have been raised that the Royal Court's production of ''Seven Jewish Children'', by Caryl Churchill is anti-Semitic.  We categorically reject that accusation....  While ''Seven Jewish Children'' is undoubtedly critical of the policies of the state of Israel, there is no suggestion that this should be read as a criticism of Jewish people....  In keeping with its philosophy, the Royal Court Theatre presents a multiplicity of viewpoints. ''The Stone'', which is currently running... asks very difficult questions about the refusal of some modern Germans to accept their ancestors' complicity in Nazi atrocities. ''Shades'', currently in our smaller studio theatre... explores issues of tolerance in the [London] Muslim community.&lt;ref name=Tele/&gt;}}

The '''running of the bulls''' ({{lang-es|encierro}}, from the verb ''encerrar'', 'to corral, to enclose'; {{lang-oc|abrivado}}&lt;!--This is the general name of the event there, as well as sometimes also a name of a sub-event, covered below.--&gt;, literally 'haste, momentum'; {{lang-ca|correbous}}, 'street-bulls') is an event that involves running in front of a small group of cattle, typically six&lt;ref name="Fiske-Harrison"&gt;[[Alexander Fiske-Harrison|Fiske-Harrison, Alexander]] (editor) [http://www.thebullsofpamplona.com ''Fiesta: How To Survive The Bulls Of Pamplona], Mephisto Press, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; but sometimes ten or more, that have been let loose on a course of a sectioned-off subset of a town's streets,&lt;ref name="Fiske-Harrison" /&gt;, usually as part of a summertime festival. Particular [[List of cattle breeds|breeds]] of cattle may be favored, such as the {{lang|es|[[Spanish Fighting Bull|toro bravo]]}} in Spain,&lt;ref name="Fiske-Harrison" /&gt; also often used in post-run [[bullfighting]], and [[Camargue cattle]] in Occitan France, which are not fought.  Actual [[bull]]s ([[Neutering|non-castrated]] male cattle) are typically used in such events.

The most famous bull-run – what a capitalized "the Running of the Bulls" most often refers to in English – is the {{lang|es|encierro}} held in [[Pamplona]] during the nine-day festival of [[San Fermín|Sanfermines]] in honour of [[Saint Fermin]].&lt;ref name="Sanfermin"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sanfermin guide: Running of the bulls |url= http://www.sanfermin.com/old/2006/guia.php?lang=eng |publisher=Kukuxumusu |date=2007 |access-date=21 July 2008 |dead-url= yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080505081343/http://www.sanfermin.com/old/2006/guia.php?lang=eng |archive-date=5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become a major global [[tourism]] event, today very different from the traditional, local festival. More traditional summer bull-runs are held in other places such as towns and villages across [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], in some cities in [[Mexico]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSTRE5114UN20090202 "Bull-run hits liquor-fueled town"], 2 February 2009. "The tradition, enacted in a handful of Mexican towns, traces its roots back to the centuries-old Pamplona bull-run in Mexico's former colonial power." Retrieved 4 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Occitan ([[Camargue]]) region of southern [[France]]. Bull-running was formerly also practiced in rural England, most famously [[Stamford bull run|at Stamford]] until 1837.

The origin of this event comes from the need to transport the bulls from the fields outside the city, where they were bred, to the [[bullring]], where they would be killed in the evening.&lt;ref&gt;According to the Mayor of Pamplona in his foreword to the book ''[http://www.thebullsofpamplona.com Fiesta: How to Survive the Bulls of Pamplona]''&lt;/ref&gt;  During this "run", youngsters would jump among them to show off their bravado. In Pamplona and other places, the six bulls in the event are still those that will feature in the afternoon [[Bullfighting|bullfight]] of the same day.

Spanish tradition holds that bull-running began in northeastern Spain in the early 14th century. While transporting cattle in order to sell them at the market, men would try to speed the process by hurrying their cattle using tactics of fear and excitement. After years of this practice, the transportation and hurrying began to turn into a competition, as young adults would attempt to race in front of the bulls and make it safely to their pens without being overtaken. When the popularity of this practice increased and was noticed more and more by the expanding population of Spanish cities, a tradition was created and stands to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.prlog.org/11571025-running-of-the-bulls-2011-live-stream-pamplona-san-fermin-festival-webcam-feed.html |title=Running of the Bulls 2011 Live Stream, Pamplona San Fermin Festival Webcam Feed |date=5 July 2011 |work=PRLog}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=July 2018}}

==Pamplona bull run==

[[File:Encierro 7 de julio de 2005.jpg|thumb|Pamplona, 7 July 2005. People climb to the fences as the bulls run by and cross the Town Hall Plaza.]]

The [[Pamplona]]&lt;ref name="Sanfermin"/&gt; encierro is the most popular in Spain and has been broadcast live by [[RTVE]], the public Spanish national television channel, for over 30 years.&lt;ref name="RTVE"&gt;{{cite web |title=27 años de Sanfermines en TVE |url= http://www.rtve.es/television/20080703/anos-sanfermines-tve/111770.shtml |work=RTVE.es |publisher=[[Corporación de Radio y Televisión Española]] |date=2008 |access-date=21 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the highest profile event of the [[San Fermín|San Fermín festival]], which is held every year from 6–14 July.&lt;ref name="Sanfermin"/&gt; The first bull running is on 7 July, followed by one on each of the following mornings of the festival, beginning every day at 8&amp;nbsp;am. Among the rules to take part in the event are that participants must be at least 18 years old, run in the same direction as the bulls, not incite the bulls, and not be under the influence of alcohol.&lt;ref name="Ayuntamiento"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Bull Run |url= http://www.pamplona.net/VerPagina.asp?IdPag=287&amp;Idioma=5 |work=Pamplona.net |publisher=Ayuntamiento de Pamplona (Council of Pamplona) |date=2008 |access-date=21 July 2008 |dead-url= yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080529011527/http://www.pamplona.net/VerPagina.asp?IdPag=287&amp;Idioma=5 |archive-date=29 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BandoAyuntamiento"/&gt;

===Fence===
In Pamplona, a set of wooden fences are erected to direct the bulls along the route and to block off side streets. A double wooden fence is used in those areas where there is enough space, while in other parts the buildings of the street act as barriers. The gaps in the barricades are wide enough for a human to slip through but narrow enough to block a bull. The fence is composed of approximately three thousand separate pieces of wood. Some parts of the fence remain in place for the duration of the fiesta, while others are placed and removed each morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.turismo.navarra.es/eng/propuestas/san-fermines/desarrollo/encierro.htm |title=Encierro bullrun San Fermin festival Sanfermines tourist information on Navarre |publisher=Government of Navarre |access-date=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectators can only stand behind the second fence, whereas the space between the two fences is reserved for security and medical personnel and also to participants who need cover during the event.&lt;ref name="BandoAyuntamiento"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bando San Fermin 2014 |publisher=Ayuntamiento de Pamplona |url= https://sedeelectronica.pamplona.es/VerDocumento/VerDocumento.aspx?IDdoc=512317 |access-date=20 March 2015 |chapter=Sección quinta |dead-url= yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150402110605/https://sedeelectronica.pamplona.es/VerDocumento/VerDocumento.aspx?IDdoc=512317 |archive-date=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preliminaries===
[[File:Sanfermin2006.jpg|thumb|Police barrier at the beginning of the running stops people until the first rocket is fired.]]

The encierro begins with runners singing a benediction. It is sung three times, each time being sung both in Spanish and [[Basque language|Basque]]. The benediction is a prayer given at a statue of [[Saint Fermin]], patron of the festival and the city, to ask the saint's protection and can be translated into English as "We ask Saint Fermin, as our Patron, to guide us through the encierro and give us his blessing". The singers finish by shouting "{{lang|es|¡Viva San Fermín!}} and {{lang|ba|Gora San Fermin!}} ('Long live Saint Fermin', in Spanish and Basque, respectively).&lt;ref name="Ayuntamiento"/&gt; Most runners dress in the traditional clothing of the festival which consists of a white shirt and trousers with a red waistband ({{lang|es|faja}}) and neckerchief ({{lang|es|pañuelo}}). Also some of them hold the day's newspaper rolled to draw the bulls' attention from them if necessary.&lt;ref name="Ayuntamiento"/&gt;

===The running===
[[File:Sanfermines Vaquillas Pamplona 03.jpg|thumb|Pamplona, 2007. Bulls following some runners enter the bull ring from the callejón, where the event ends. The bulls can be seen in the foreground and background of the picture.]] 
A first rocket is set off at 8&amp;nbsp;a.m. to alert the runners that the corral gate is open. A second rocket signals that all six bulls have been released. The third and fourth rockets are signals that all of the [[herd]] has entered the [[bullring]] and its corral respectively, marking the end of the event.&lt;ref name="Ayuntamiento"/&gt; The average duration between the first rocket and the end of the encierro is two minutes, 30 seconds.&lt;ref name="Ayuntamiento"/&gt;

The encierro is usually composed of the six bulls to be [[Bullfighting|fought]] in the afternoon, six [[oxen|steers]] that run in herd with the bulls, and three more steers that follow the herd to encourage any reluctant bulls to continue along the route. The function of the steers, who run the route daily, is to guide the bulls to the bullring.&lt;ref name="Ayuntamiento"/&gt; The average speed of the herd is {{convert|24|abbr=on|km/h|mph}}.&lt;ref name="Ayuntamiento"/&gt;

The length of the run is {{convert|875|meters|yards|abbr=off}}. It goes through four streets of the old part of the city (Santo Domingo, Ayuntamiento, Mercaderes and Estafeta) via the Town Hall Square and the short section "Telefónica" (named for the location of the old telephone office at end of Calle Estafeta) just before entering into the bullring through its callejón (tunnel).&lt;ref name="Sanfermin"/&gt; The fastest part of the route is up Santo Domingo and across the Town Hall Square, but the bulls often became separated at the entrance to Estafeta Street as they slowed down. One or more would slip going into the turn at Estafeta ("la curva"), resulting in the installation of anti-slip surfacing, and now most of the bulls negotiate the turn onto Estafeta and are often ahead of the steers. This has resulted in a quicker run. Runners are not permitted in the first 50 meters of the encierro, which is an uphill grade where the bulls are much faster.{{Citation needed |date=March 2010}}

===Injuries, fatalities, and medical attention===
[[File:Sanfermines Vaquillas Pamplona 06.jpg|thumb|Two injured runners are treated by medical services.]]
Every year, between 50 and 100 people are injured during the run.&lt;ref name="Ayuntamiento"/&gt; Not all of the injuries require taking the patients to the hospital: in 2013, 50 people were taken by ambulance to Pamplona's hospital, with this number nearly doubling that of 2012.&lt;ref name=balance2013/&gt;

Goring is much less common but potentially life threatening. In 2013, for example, six participants were gored along the festival, in 2012, only four runners were injured by the horns of the bulls with exactly the same number of gored people in 2011, nine in 2010 and 10 in 2009; with one of the latter killed.&lt;ref name=balance2013&gt;{{cite web |title=Los encierros se saldan con 50 heridos trasladados y 6 corneados |url= http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/2013/07/15/especiales/sanfermines-2013/los-encierros-se-saldan-con-50-heridos-trasladados-y-6-corneados |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130716191136/http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/2013/07/15/especiales/sanfermines-2013/los-encierros-se-saldan-con-50-heridos-trasladados-y-6-corneados |dead-url= yes |archive-date=16 July 2013 |work=Noticias de Navarra |access-date=15 July 2013 |first=Gorka |last=Alonso |language=es |date=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Los encierros de 2012 dejan cuatro heridos por asta, los mismos que en 2011 |url= http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/2012/07/14/especiales/sanfermines-2012/los-encierros-de-2012-dejan-cuatro-heridos-por-asta-los-mismos-que-en-2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120719015939/http://www.noticiasdenavarra.com/2012/07/14/especiales/sanfermines-2012/los-encierros-de-2012-dejan-cuatro-heridos-por-asta-los-mismos-que-en-2011 |dead-url= yes |archive-date=19 July 2012 |work=Diario de Noticias |access-date=13 July 2013 |language=es |date=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As most of the runners are male, only 5 women have been gored since 1974. Before that date, running was prohibited for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quinta mujer corneada en los encierros de San Fermín |url= http://www.diariodenavarra.es/noticias/san_fermin/2013/encierro/14_julio/2013/07/14/quinta_mujer_corneada_encierros_san_fermin_124090_2696.html |publisher=Diario de Navarra |access-date=15 July 2013 |agency=[[EFE]] |language=es |date=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major risk is runners falling and piling up (a "montón") at the entrance of the bullring, which acts as a funnel as it is much narrower than the previous street. In such cases injuries come both from [[asphyxia]] and contusions to those in the pile and from goring if the bulls crush into the pile. This kind of blocking of the entrance has occurred at least ten times in the history of the run, the last occurring in 2013 and the first dating back to 1878. A runner died of suffocation in one such pile up in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Montón en el encierro de Sanfermines, un peligro con historia |url= http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2013/07/13/actualidad/1373715922_509640.html |work=El País |access-date=14 July 2013 |first=Javier |last=Doria |language=es |date=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, since record-keeping began in 1910, 15 people have been killed in the bull running of Pamplona, most of them due to being gored.&lt;ref name="Ayuntamiento" /&gt; To minimize the impact of injuries every day 200 people collaborate in the medical attention. They are deployed in 16 sanitary posts (every 50 metres on average), each one with at least a physician and a nurse among their personnel. Most of these 200 people are volunteers, mainly from the [[Red Cross]]. In addition to the medical posts, there are around 20 ambulances. This organization makes it possible to have a gored person stabilized and taken to a hospital in less than 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Especialistas destacan que el dispositivo sanitario de los encierros "no se puede mejorar" porque es "espectacular" |url= http://www.diariodenavarra.es/20090618/pamplona/especialistas-destacan-dispositivo-sanitario-encierros-puede-mejorar.html?not=2009061812175488&amp;idnot=2009061812175488&amp;dia=20090618&amp;seccion=pamplona&amp;seccion2=pamplona&amp;chnl=10 |work=Diario de Navarra |access-date=16 July 2013 |language=es |date=18 June 2009 |dead-url= yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131104223702/http://www.diariodenavarra.es/20090618/pamplona/especialistas-destacan-dispositivo-sanitario-encierros-puede-mejorar.html?not=2009061812175488&amp;idnot=2009061812175488&amp;dia=20090618&amp;seccion=pamplona&amp;seccion2=pamplona&amp;chnl=10 |archive-date=4 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dress code===
[[File:Bull Run Clemson.jpg|thumb|Runners at the [[Pamplona]] bull run in typical attire]]

Though there is no formal dress code, the very common and traditional attire is white trousers, white shirt with a red scarf around the waist and a red handkerchief around the neck.
Another common dress practice, seen as a risk by some but as a daring depiction of courage by others is dressing in a conspicuous manner.  Many runners that want to be seen wear colors other than white, a common alternate color choice is blue.  Others include large logos on their shirt to capture the attention of the bulls.  In the age of social media explosion, this is also thought to be a way to highlight someone in a photo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gospain.about.com/od/spanishfestivals/qt/pamplonasurvive.htm |title=How to get the most out of your Pamplona Running of the Bulls experience |date= |work=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source inline|certain=yes|date=July 2018}}

The encierro of Pamplona has been depicted many times in literature, television or advertising, but became known worldwide partly because of the descriptions of [[Ernest Hemingway]] in books ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'' and ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]''. The cinema pioneer [[Louis Lumière]] filmed the run in 1899.&lt;ref name="Auñamendi film"&gt;''[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/39025 Encierro de toros]'' in the Spanish-language [[Auñamendi Encyclopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The event is the basis for a chapter in [[James Michener]]'s 1971 novel ''[[The Drifters (novel)|The Drifters]]''.

The run is depicted in the 1991 [[Billy Crystal]] film ''[[City Slickers]]'', where the character "Mitch" (Crystal) is gored (non-fatally) from behind by a bull during a vacation with the other main characters.

The run appears in the 2011 [[Bollywood]] movie ''[[Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara]]'', directed by [[Zoya Akhtar]], as the final dare in the bucket list of the three bachelors who have to overcome their ultimate fear; death. At first, the trio run part of the route. They stop at the square, but then recover their nerve, and continue to the end. The completion of the run depicts their freedom as they learn that surviving a mortal danger can bring joy.

''Running with Bulls,'' a 2012 documentary of the festival filmed by Construct Creatives and presented by Jason Farrel, depicts the pros and cons of the controversial tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title |2328852 |Running with Bulls&lt;!-- (2012)--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014, the [[Esquire Channel]] has broadcast the running of the bulls as a show in the US,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140713014334/http://tv.esquire.com/shows/running-of-the-bulls 'Running Of The Bulls'], Esquire TV&lt;/ref&gt; with both live commentary and then a recorded 'round up' later in the day by [[NBCSN]] commentators the [[Men in Blazers]], including interviews with noted participants such as Madrid-born runner David Ubeda,&lt;ref&gt;Vadillo, Jose Luis.

In 2014, the eBook guide, ''Fiesta: How To Survive The Bulls Of Pamplona'', caused headlines around the world when one of the contributors was gored by a bull soon after its publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepamplonapost.com/2014/07/12/gored-buffalo-bill-hillmann-charlie-sheen-tommy-ramone-matador-juan-jose-padilla-more/ 'San Fermín So Far – 2014'] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141015175110/http://thepamplonapost.com/2014/07/12/gored-buffalo-bill-hillmann-charlie-sheen-tommy-ramone-matador-juan-jose-padilla-more/ |date=15 October 2014 }} The Pamplona Post, 12 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Running of the Bulls#Further reading|Further Reading]] section below.)

==Other examples==
[[File:Tudela St Anna7719m.jpg|thumb|Fire bull and children running from it ([[Tudela, Navarre]])]]

Although the most famous running of the bulls is that of [[San Fermín]],&lt;ref name="Sanfermin"/&gt; they are held in towns and villages across [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], and in some cities in southern [[France]] during the summer. Examples are the bull run of [[San Sebastián de los Reyes]], near [[Madrid]], at the end of August which is the most popular of Spain after Pamplona, the bull run of [[Cuéllar]], considered as the oldest of Spain since there are documents of its existence dating back to 1215, the Highland Capeias of the Raia in Sabugal, [[Portugal]], with horses leading the herd crossing old border passes out of Spain and using the medieval 'Forcåo', or the bull run of [[Navalcarnero]] held at night.

Other ''encierros'' have also caused fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;Mari Carmen López del Burgo, aged 48, from Madrid, Spain. {{cite web |url= http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Muere/mujer/embestida/toro/encierros/Arganda/Rey/elpepuesp/20100909elpepunac_3/Tes |title=Muere una mujer embestida por un toro en los encierros de Arganda del Rey |work=ElPais.com |date=9 September 2010 |access-date=9 September 2010 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{lang|ca|Correbous}} or {{lang|ca|bous al carrer}}===
[[File:Bous Albocàsser.jpg|thumb|''Bous al carrer'' at [[Albocàsser]] ]]
''Bous al carrer'', ''correbou'' or ''correbous'' (meaning in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], 'bulls in the street', 'street-bulls') is a typical festivity in many villages in the [[Valencian region]], [[Terres de l'Ebre]], [[Catalonia]], and [[Fornalutx]], [[Mallorca]]. Another similar tradition is ''soltes de vaques'', where [[cow]]s are used instead of [[bull]]s. Even though they can take place all along the year, they are most usual during [[Fiesta patronal|local festival]]s (normally in August). Compared to [[encierro]]s, animals are not directed to any [[bullring]].

These festivities are normally organized by the youngsters of the village, as a way for showing their courage and ability with the bull. Some sources consider this tradition a masculine [[initiation rite]] to [[adulthood]].&lt;ref&gt;Touristic leaflet.

===Occitan area of France===
[[File:Calvisson - Abrivado.jpg|thumb|An {{lang|oc|abrivado}} at Calvisson. The guardians are demonstrating their skill in turn a group of at least four bulls through a 360 degree turn]]
[[File:Calvisson - Bandido Caught.jpg|thumb|A {{lang|oc|bandido}} at Calvisson. Contact has been made with the bull: but it has not yet been stopped.]]

Numerous bull-running events happen in France in the region around [[Sommières]], in accordance with the [[Camargue]]s tradition, in which no bulls are intentionally injured or killed. For instance, in [[Calvisson]], the annual event takes place around 20 July over a period of five days. There are four events: the {{lang|oc|abrivado}}, in which at least ten bulls are run together through the street guided by a group of twelve {{lang|oc|[[gardian]]s}} mounted on white [[Camargue horse]]s; the {{lang|oc|encierro}}, in which one bull is released outside the foyer and finds his own way back to the pen; the {{lang|oc|bandido}}, in which one bull is run, accompanied through the streets; and the {{lang|oc|bandido de nuit}}, which is the same thing but after dark. Boys and men run with the bulls and try and separate them from the horses, stop them, and physically turn them away from the horses.

===Stamford bull run===
{{Main article|Stamford bull run}}
The English town of [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]] was host to the [[Stamford bull run]] for almost 700 years until it was abandoned in 1837.&lt;ref name=cbd&gt;{{Cite book |title=Chambers Book of Days (1864) |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=K0UJAAAAIAAJ |date=1832 |publisher=W. &amp; R. Chambers Ltd.}} 13 November entry&lt;/ref&gt; According to local tradition, the custom dated from the time of [[John of England|King John]] when [[William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey]], saw two bulls fighting in the meadow beneath. Some butchers came to part the combatants and one of the bulls ran into the town, causing a great uproar. The earl, mounting his horse, rode after the animal, and enjoyed the sport so much, that he gave the meadow in which the fight began, to the butchers of Stamford, on condition that they should provide a bull, to be run in the town every 13 November, for ever after. As of 2013 the bull run had been revived as a ceremonial, festival-style community event.

===Mock bull runs===
A variation is the nightly "[[fire bull]]" where balls of flammable material are placed on the horns. Currently the bull is often replaced by a runner carrying a frame on which [[fireworks]] are placed and dodgers, usually children, run to avoid the sparks.

In 2008, [[Red Bull Racing]] driver [[David Coulthard]] and [[Scuderia Toro Rosso]] driver [[Sébastien Bourdais]] performed a version of a 'bull running' event in Pamplona, Spain, with the Formula One cars chasing 500 runners through the actual Pamplona route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/190660/red-bull-to-visit-pamplona-for-bull-running/ |title=Red Bull to visit Pamplona for Bull running |work=GPUpdate.net  |date=11 June 2008 |access-date=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NO Bull French Quarter 2010.JPG|thumb|"Running of the Bulls" in the [[French Quarter]] of New Orleans]]
The [[Big Easy Rollergirls]] roller derby team has performed an annual mock bull run in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana since 2007. The team, dressed as bulls, skates after runners through the French Quarter.  In 2012, there were 14,000 runners and over 400 "bulls" from all over the country, with huge before- and after-parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Keith I. |last=Marszalek |url= http://blog.nola.com/entertainment/2007/06/big_easy_rollergirls_to_reinac.html |title=Big Easy Rollergirls to reinact &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; famed bull run |work=Blog.NOLA.com |date=24 June 2007 |access-date=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://laughingsquid.com/san-fermin-in-nueva-orleans-running-roller-girls/ |title=San Fermín in Nueva Orleans, The Running of the Roller Girls |work=[[Laughing Squid]] |date=20 July 2008 |access-date=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Coviello |first=Will |title=Running of the Bulls 2012 |url= http://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/running-of-the-bulls-2012/Content?oid=2037444 |work=Gambit Weekly |access-date=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ballyjamesduff]], Ireland, an annual event called the Pig Run is held with small pigs. It looks just like a mini-{{lang|es|encierro}} but with pigs instead of bulls.

In [[Dewey Beach, Delaware]], a bar named The Starboard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thestarboard.com/ |title=Dewey Beach, DE |work=The Starboard |date= |access-date=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{complete citation needed|date=July 2018|reason=This is a link to the homepage of a website, not an article.}} sponsors an annual Running of the Bull {{sic}}, in which hundreds of red- and white-clad beachgoers are chased down the shore by a single "bull" (two people in a [[pantomime horse]]-style costume).

In [[Rangiora]], New Zealand, an annual Running of the Sheep is held, in which 1000–2000 sheep are released down the main street of the small farming town.

The Running of the Bulls UK is a [[pub crawl]] event that takes place on London's [[Hampstead Heath]] and uses fast human runners in place of bulls.

In 2014, Pamplona inaugurated a series of running events in June, the San Fermín Marathon, of a full [[marathon]] (42.195&amp;nbsp;km), half-marathon (21.097&amp;nbsp;km), or 10&amp;nbsp;km road race that concludes with the final 900m of each race using the {{lang|es|encierro}} route, runners crossing the finish line inside the bullring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sanferminmarathon.com |title=Home2018 - EDP San Fermín Marathon |date= |work=SanFerminMarathon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==
Many opponents argue that bulls are mentally injured by the harassment and voicing of both participants and spectators, and some of animals may also die because of the [[stress (psychological)|stress]], especially if they are [[rope]]d or bring flares in their horns ([[bou embolat]] version).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lavanc.com/lavanc/iphp/not1.php?id=956 Article sobre la crueltat dels bous al carrer.] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012155835/http://lavanc.com/lavanc/iphp/not1.php?id=956 |date=12 October 2007 }} {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all this, the festivities seem to have wide popular support in their villages&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120911032132/http://www.lamalla.net/actualitat_cultural/festes_populars/article?id=71973 Article sobre la popularitat dels bous al carrer a les terres de l'Ebre.] {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[animal rights]] [[Activism|activists]] oppose the event. [[PETA]] activists created the [[Running of the Nudes]], a demonstration done two days before the beginning of San Fermín in Pamplona. By marching naked, they protested the festival and the following bullfight, arguing the bulls are tortured for entertainment.&lt;ref name="PETA"&gt;[http://www.runningofthenudes.com/ Running of the Nudes]. [[PETA]] official site.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[San Miguel de Allende]], Mexico, cancelled its ''Sanmiguelada'' running of the bulls after 2006, citing public disorder associated with the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/mexico/entries/2007/05/24/no_more_bull_running_that_is_i.html "No More Bull (Running, That Is) in San Miguel de Allende,"] Austin American-Statesman, 24 May 2007. Retrieved 4 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; After the event was cancelled in San Miguel, the city of [[Salvatierra, Guanajuato|Salvatierra]], also in the state of [[Guanajuato]], picked up the event. It is now called ''La Marquesada'' and the three-day event is held during the last weekend of the month of September or first weekend of October.

'''Saeed Hanaei''' or '''Said Hanai''' ({{lang-fa|سعید حنایی}}, born 1962 - died April 8, 2002) was an [[Iran]]ian [[serial killer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-newspaper.com/1380/800507/html/casual.htm Iranian newspaper - Events page - No. 1866 - Seventh year - Sunday, August 7, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Hanaei was born in 1962. At the time of his murders, he was married and had three children. He was a construction worker by profession.

==Crimes==
Hanaei targeted female [[prostitution|prostitutes]] in the eastern city of [[Mashhad]]. He often targeted [[drug addiction|drug addicts]].

The killings were referred to as the "''spider killings''" by the Iranian press because Hanaei lured the women to his home and strangled them and dumped their bodies. He killed 16 women between 2000 and 2001 before he was apprehended by the police.

The murders were the following:

* On August 7, 2000, Afsaneh Karimpour, a 30-year-old woman who had a 9-year-old girl, disappeared
* On August 10, a woman named Layla was found strangled beneath the Khin-e-Rab Road of Mashhad near some tomato bushes.
* On August 11, in the Sagradeshahr neighbourhood of Mashhad, the body of a woman named Fariba Rahimpur was discovered in a yellow [[burlap]] sack. She too had been strangled.
* On January 3, 2001, near the [[Iran Khodro]] Company in Mashhad, a woman named Massoumeh was found dead.
* On February 16, in front of Iran Khodro, the body of 27-year-old Sarah Rahmani was discovered in a tent.
* On February 29, the strangled body of 45-year-old Azam Abdi was discovered near the Khin-Arab road.
* On March 19, the body of 50-year-old Sakineh Kayhanzadeh was discovered in northeastern Mashhad. Her body had been wrapped up in black cloth.
* On March 23, the body of another woman, Khadijeh Full Qasri, who had been strangled with a scarf, was found in the village of [[Dustabad, Mashhad|Dustabad]] near Mashhad.
* On April 12, on the edge of the road to [[Quchan]], near the Shahid Fahmidah Square and Khane Ara road, the body of 35-year-old Marzieh Saadatyan was discovered in a tent.
* On April 14, the body of a 35-year-old strangled woman named Maryam was found wrapped up in a tent.
* The following day, another 35-year-old woman named Touba was's body was found in a similar position.
* On April 24, the body of 31-year-old Azra Hajizadeh was discovered on the North Khayyam Street in Mashhad.
* On July 3, the body Maryam Beygi, 28, was discovered at the Shaheed Mosavi Boulevard in Mashhad, along with the bodies of two women named Shiva and Zahra. All three were strangled.
* On July 11, the body of a 20-year-old strangled woman named Leila was found in Mashhad.
* On July 24, the body of 18-year-old Mahboube Allah was discovered on Quchan's old road.
* In August, the body of 33-year-old Zahra Dadkhosravi, the last victim of the so-called by the media "Spider Killer", was found.

==Motives==
His motives were primarily focused on the ideal that he was helping cleanse the city of moral corruption. He claimed in court that he began killing the prostitutes after his wife was mistaken for one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/18/world/iran-executes-worker-who-strangled-16-women-over-2-years.html Iran Executes Worker Who Strangled 16 Women Over 2 Years, ''NYtimes'', April 18, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Following Hanai's arrest, hard-liners began a campaign in his support, arguing that he had tried to clean the country of corruption. The [[Kayhan]] daily reported that many in Mashhad had been happy with the killings. Another report said a lawyer had volunteered to defend him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiozamaaneh.com/friday/2008/07/post_83.html Women's serial killers or self-proclaimed social security schemes]&lt;/ref&gt;

“Who is to be judged?" wrote the conservative newspaper [[Islamic Republican (newspaper)|Jomhuri Islami.]] "Those who look to eradicate the sickness or those who stand at the root of the corruption?" Such sentiments were expressed by the killer's merchant friends at the Mashhad bazaar, one of whom said with a laugh: "He did the right thing. He should have continued."&lt;ref&gt;[http://goftaniha.org/631/hanaei/ Saeed Hanaei is alive]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution==
He was found guilty and [[hanging|hanged]] at dawn on April 8, 2002 in Mashhad Prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iraninstitute.com/1381/810128/html/casual.htm Mashhad street woman killer is executed today]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iraninstitute.com/1381/810129/html/casual.htm Saeed Hanaei was executed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/news/020417_he-iranexec.shtml Street killer was executed]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The incident was the subject of the 2002 documentary ''And Along Came a Spider'', directed by [[Maziar Bahari]], and it includes an interview with Hanaei.&lt;ref&gt;[http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=Is8pDKOFcvA Interview with Saeed Hanaei, Iran's Most Serious Assasin]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
After Anand Kumar was accused of fraud results, the makers of upcoming film Super 30  have decided to not call their film a biopic anymore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.movietalkies.com/news/super-30-makers-left-red-faced-anand-kumar-faces-charges-fraud/|title=Super 30’ Makers Left Red-Faced As Anand Kumar Faces Charges Of Fraud|date=2018-08-04|work=MoviesTalkies.com|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Super 30 will be the last film of Phantom films as the production house has been dissolved because director [[Vikas Bahl]] has been alleged in sexual misconduct matters from actress [[Nayani Dixit]] and a phantom employee. This will be the last project of Phantom Films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scroll.in/reel/897243/phantom-founded-by-anurag-kashyap-vikas-bahl-vikramaditya-motwane-and-madha-mantena-shuts-shop|title=Phantom, founded by Anurag Kashyap, Vikas Bahl, Vikramaditya Motwane and Madhu Mantena, shuts shop|last=Staff|first=Scroll|work=Scroll.in|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Take 21 has attracted film makers from several different countries. Prizes have focused on work experiences in the industry, scholarships to film making programmes, money, and film equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thegate.ca/event/toronto-student-film-festival-2012/ | title=The Gate, TSFF Article | accessdate=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the fall of 2005, three grade twelve students from [[Crescent School (Toronto)|Crescent School]] in Toronto, Ontario, approached their teacher, Jamie MacRae, with the idea of creating a new student film festival specifically designed to showcase youth talent, and creativity. The festival would provide an opportunity for students from any part of the world to screen their media works and short films. The TSFF Founding Committee was made up of  these three Crescent School students – Zack Russell, Gordon Steiner, and David Whyte, Jamie MacRae (Head of Media Arts, Crescent School, Colin Lowndes Head of Crescent’s Upper [High] School, and entertainment executive Pat Macdonald.

The '''Teatro Dal Verme''' is a theatre in [[Milan]],  Italy located on the Via San Giovanni sul Muro, on the site of the former private theatre the ''Politeama Ciniselli''. It was designed by Giuseppe Pestagalli to a commission from Count Francesco Dal Verme, and was used primarily for plays and [[opera]] performances throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. Today, the theatre is no longer used for opera, and is a venue for concerts, plays and dance performances, as well as exhibitions and conferences.

The original 3,000-seat theatre, surmounted by a large [[cupola]], was constructed in the traditional horseshoe shape, with two tiers of boxes and a large gallery (or ''loggione'') which alone contained more than 1000 seats. It opened on September 14, 1872 with a production of [[Meyerbeer]]'s ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' and soon established itself as one of Italy's most important opera houses. During its "golden years", the theatre saw the world premieres of [[Puccini]]'s ''[[Le Villi]]'' (May 31, 1884); [[Leoncavallo]]'s  ''[[Pagliacci]]'' (May 21, 1892) and ''[[I Medici]]'' (November 9, 1893); and [[Frederic Hymen Cowen|Cowen]]'s ''[[Signa (opera)|Signa]]'' (November 12, 1893). It also saw the Italian premiere of [[Franz Lehár|Lehár]]'s ''[[Merry Widow|The Merry Widow]]'' (April 27, 1907).

By the 1930s, the theatre was mainly being used as a cinema. It was then severely damaged by American aerial bombardment during World War II, after which its magnificent central cupola, which had survived the bombing, was stripped of all its metal parts by the occupying German army. It was partially rebuilt in 1946, and for a period in the 1950s it was used for the performance of [[Musical theatre|musicals]]. It then reverted to a cinema and a political conference hall.

In 1991, the theatre's interior underwent a major restructuring and renovation project which was completed in 1998. It now has a large modern auditorium, the ''Sala Grande'', with 1420 seats, a smaller performing space known as the ''Sala Piccola'', with 200 seats, and a space for exhibitions and conferences, the ''Sala Terrazzo''. Since September 2001, it has been administered by the ''Fondazione I Pomeriggi Musicali'', whose orchestra (the [[Orchestra i Pomeriggi Musicali]]) is resident at the theatre.

'''''The Historical Novel''''' is a 1924 book by [[Herbert Butterfield]]. It originated in an undergraduate essay and gained the Le Bas Prize for Butterfield. It was originally published by [[Cambridge University Press]], one of the conditions for the prize.

==Summary==
The work was Butterfield's first publication. It developed from the embryo of a paper, presented to the Peterhouse History Society in the Michaelmas term, which he then expanded.

It examines the relationship between the form of the [[Historical fiction#Historical novel|historical novel]] on the one hand and the formal study of history on the other. It explores the style of historical fictions, the way in which they engage with evidence (and how that differs from the orthodox [[historical method]]) and the extent to which such a form of writing affects mainstream historical scholarship itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Historical Novel|url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/history/regional-and-world-history-general-interest/historical-novel-essay|website=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterfield sees the historical novel as a form which is a kind of 'fusion' of other styles and approaches. In particular, he sees a potential in it for a form of historical empathy that can provide deep insights into the motivations behind the actions of historical protagonists such as [[Napoleon]]; it can also be used to marshall a sense of nationalistic or patriot feeling becoming, itself, a "maker of history" rather than merely a reflector or mirror of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Groot|first1=Jerome|title=The Historical Novel|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=113525320X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82avWVrVeukC&amp;pg=PT3&amp;lpg=PT3&amp;dq=%22Historical+Novel%22+Butterfield&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Fq9dzFHgBi&amp;sig=VSrtwqcq63ddSQzblX0xd-Z_smw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ftXTU-HTH-zZ0QWA5YCgAQ&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Historical%20Novel%22%20Butterfield&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its purposes, according to Butterfield, was to help us 'feel' a particular epoch of the past in ways in which traditional historical writing might not because of the different role and importance of the imagination in the case of the historical novel. Another important element of historical fiction for Butterfield was its role in bringing to light the existence of uncertainty in human affairs as lived by real people: the historian, in his view, tends to have a retrospective reach which draws out trajectories and processes over time, but the characters in a historical novel live as real human beings do, being only aware of probabilities and potential situations rather than knowing precisely where certain events and phenomena are headed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lowenthal|first1=David|title=The Past is a Foreign Country|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521294800|pages=226–227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMqsAQZmv5IC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22Historical+Novel%22+Butterfield&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G9jTU_bFBcOV7AbymYFw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Historical%20Novel%22%20Butterfield&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work did not display Butterfield's later detestation of the form of the historical novel; later on, moreover, he referred to the arguments in his first publication in disparaging terms, arguing that it was 'a bad book'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bentley|first1=Michael|title=The Life and Thought of Herbert Butterfield: History, Science and God|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1139502859|pages=45–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1r2DMbwZegC&amp;pg=PT52&amp;dq=%22Historical+Novel%22+Butterfield&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sNbTU86WN8_H7AaE_ID4CA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Historical%20Novel%22%20Butterfield&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2876">'''Ticket fixing''' is a practice in which a public official destroys or dismisses a pending [[traffic ticket]] as a favor to a friend or family member. For example, [[police officer]]s in a number of jurisdictions have been charged with destroying pending tickets at the request of other officers. [[Judge]]s have also been accused of ticket fixing. Some police officers consider it a "professional courtesy" extended to friends and relatives of police officers. However, the practice is unpopular with the general public,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnainfo.com/20110512/manhattan/most-new-yorkers-say-they-wouldnt-try-fix-ticket-poll-finds |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403122806/http://www.dnainfo.com/20110512/manhattan/most-new-yorkers-say-they-wouldnt-try-fix-ticket-poll-finds |archivedate=2012-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is illegal in most jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in New York: https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/opinion/the-nypds-ticket-fixing-scandal.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

Allegations of ticket fixing have cropped up for decades in jurisdictions around the [[United States]], including [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], [[New York City]], and [[San Diego]].

In 1986, officers of the [[Georgia State Patrol]] faced charges of ticket fixing.&lt;ref&gt;Ticket-fixing probe rocks Georgia. ''Henderdson Times-News''. September 17, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, an investigation revealed widespread ticket-fixing in Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;"Traffic ticket-fixing alleged in Alabama," ''Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel.'' October 7, 1999. https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PfghAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Zi8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6316,1734224&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Santa Clara County]] judge [[William Danser]] faced charges of fixing tickets and reducing [[drunk driving]] sentences for "South Bay athletes, golfing buddies and friends of friends."&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.sfgate.com/2004-07-27/bay-area/17436305_1_house-arrest-arrest-sentence-william-danser&lt;/ref&gt; On October 27, 2011, at least 11 [[New York City Police Department|New York police officers]] were charged with offenses related to ticket fixing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/28/nyregion/16-officers-ordered-to-surrender-in-ticket-fixing.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/29/nyregion/officers-unleash-anger-at-ticket-fixing-arraignments-in-the-bronx.html?pagewanted=1&lt;/ref&gt; A clerk in the San Francisco government faced ticket fixing accusations in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/S-F-untangling-a-skein-of-ticket-fixing-scams-3266398.php&lt;/ref&gt; Two police officers were charged with ticket fixing in Garden Grove, CA, in 2012. &lt;ref&gt;http://ggjournal.com/2012/06/07/two-police-charged-in-ticket-fixing-case/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USCGC ''Point Welcome'' (WPB-82329)''' was an {{convert|82|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Point class cutter|''Point''-class]] [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutter]] constructed at the [[United States Coast Guard Yard|Coast Guard Yard]] at [[Curtis Bay, Maryland]] in 1961 for use as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. Since the Coast Guard policy in 1962 was not to name [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutters]] under {{convert|100|ft|m}} in length, she was designated as ''WPB-82329'' when commissioned and was named ''Point Welcome'' in January 1964 when the Coast Guard began naming all cutters longer than {{convert|65|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name="USCG"&gt;[http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Point_Class_WPB_Index.asp Coast Guard Historian website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheina72&gt;Scheina, p 72&lt;/ref&gt; She was notable for being the victim of an inter-service [[friendly fire]] incident during the [[Vietnam War]].

==Construction and design details==
''Point Welcome'' was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.&lt;ref name=Scheina71&gt;Scheina, p 71&lt;/ref&gt; She was powered by two {{convert|600|hp|0|abbr=on}} VT600 [[Cummins]] diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed {{convert|42|inch|m|abbr=on}} propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by {{convert|800|hp|0|abbr=on}} VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was {{convert|1550|gal|liters|}} and fuel tank capacity was {{convert|1840|gal|liters|}} at 95% full.&lt;ref name="USCG" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheina71&gt;Scheina, p 71&lt;/ref&gt; Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.&lt;ref name=Scotti165&gt;Scotti, p 165&lt;/ref&gt;

The design specifications for ''Point Welcome'' included a steel hull for durability, and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer [[Watch system|watch]] in the engine room.&lt;ref name=Scotti165&gt;Scotti, p 165&lt;/ref&gt; Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.&lt;ref name=Scotti165&gt;Scotti, p 165&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Propeller|screw]]s were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.&lt;ref name=Scotti166&gt;Scotti, p 166&lt;/ref&gt; Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a [[ship floodability|watertight door]] on the [[starboard side]] aft of the [[deckhouse]]. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer.&lt;ref name=Scotti166&gt;Scotti, p 166&lt;/ref&gt; The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, [[scuttlebutt]], a small desk and [[Head (watercraft)|head]]. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]], [[mess]] and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.&lt;ref name=Scotti166&gt;Scotti, p 166&lt;/ref&gt; Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam War service.&lt;ref name="USCG" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Scheina72&gt;Scheina, p 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scotti10&gt;Scotti, p 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scotti219&gt;Scotti, p 219&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After delivery in 1962, ''Point Welcome'' was assigned a homeport of [[Everett, Washington]], where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat.&lt;ref name="USCG" /&gt;

At the request of the [[United States Navy]], in April 1965, she was alerted for service in [[South Vietnam]] and assigned to [[Coast Guard Squadron One]] in support of [[Operation Market Time]], along with 16 other Point class cutters.&lt;ref name=Larzelere13&gt;Larzelere, p 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cutler84&gt;Cutler, p 84&lt;/ref&gt; While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at [[Coast Guard Island]] and [[Parks Reserve Forces Training Area|Camp Parks, California]], ''Point Welcome'' was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to [[Subic Bay]], [[Philippines]] in May 1965. She was refit for combat service.&lt;ref name="USCG" /&gt; Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of four [[M2 Browning machine gun|M-2 machine guns]]. The original bow-mounted machine gun was replaced with a combination over-under 50 caliber machine gun/81mm trigger-fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in South Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USCG" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Larzelere21&gt;Larzelere, p 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cutler82&gt;Cutler, p 82&lt;/ref&gt;
For service in Vietnam, two commissioned officers were added to the crew to add seniority in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.&lt;ref name=Larzelere15&gt;Larzelere, p 15&lt;/ref&gt;

''Point Welcome'' was assigned to Division 12 of Squadron One to be based at [[Danang]], along with {{Ship|USCGC|Point Arden|WPB-82309|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Point Caution|WPB-82301|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Point Dume|WPB-82325|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Point Ellis|WPB-82330|2}}, {{Ship|USCGC|Point Gammon|WPB-82328|2}}, and {{Ship|USCGC|Point Orient|WPB-82319|2}}. After sea trials, the Division left Subic Bay for Danang on 16 July 1965 in the company of {{USS|Snohomish County|LST-1126|6}}, their temporary support ship. After almost two weeks at sea, they arrived at their new duty station on 20 July and began patrolling the coastal waters near Danang.&lt;ref name=Larzelere22&gt;Larzelere, p 22&lt;/ref&gt; Duty consisted of boarding Vietnamese junks to search for contraband weapons and ammunition and checking the identification papers of persons on board. Permanent engineering and logistic support of Division 12 was provided by a U.S. Navy non-self-propelled floating workshop, YR-71. During this time, the WPB's were directed to paint the hulls and superstructures formula 20 deck gray to cover the Coast Guard's stateside white paint. This increased the effectiveness of night patrols.&lt;ref name=Larzelere54&gt;Larzelere p 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cutler85&gt;Cutler, p 85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friendly fire===
[[File:PointWelcome002sm.jpg|left|thumb|Aft view of the bridge of ''Point Welcome'' after the friendly fire incident of 11 August 1966]]
''Point Welcome'' was about three-quarters of a mile south of the [[17th parallel north|17th parallel]], in the limits of the DMZ,&lt;ref name=Kelley5-142&gt;Kelley, p 5-142&lt;/ref&gt; when she was attacked in the pre-dawn hours of 11 August 1966 by three aircraft of the [[U.S. Air Force]] while on patrol in the waters near the mouth of the [[Thạch Hãn River|Cửa Việt River]].&lt;ref name=Larzelere24&gt;Larzelere, p 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Navysna/&gt;&lt;ref name=PointWelcome/&gt;&lt;ref name=CoastGuardsmen/&gt; Her commanding officer, LTJG David Brostrom, along with one crewman, EN2 Jerry Phillips, were killed in this friendly fire incident.&lt;ref name="vvmf1"&gt;[http://www.vvmf.org/thewall/Wall_Id_No=5909 Vietnam Veterans Memorial Virtual Wall - Brostrom]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vvmf2"&gt;[http://www.vvmf.org/thewall/Wall_Id_No=40642 Vietnam Veterans Memorial Virtual Wall - Phillips]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Larzelere25&gt;Larzelere, p 25&lt;/ref&gt; Brostrom and Phillips were two of seven Coast Guardsmen killed in action during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref name="USCG" /&gt; The ship's executive officer, LTJG Ross Bell was severely wounded leaving Chief Boatswain's Mate [[Richard H. Patterson|Richard Patterson]] in charge with several of the crew injured.&lt;ref name=Wells1998&gt;Wells II, William R., "Friendly Target", Naval History Magazine, Volume 12, Number 3, June 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  A South Vietnamese liaison officer, LTJG Do Viet Vien, and civilian freelance journalist [[Tim Page (photographer)|Tim Page]], were aboard during the incident&lt;ref name=Scotti105&gt;Scotti, p 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Patterson saved the cutter and the surviving crew at great risk to himself.&lt;ref name=CoastGuardsmen/&gt; He was awarded a [[Bronze Star]] with the [[V device|combat "V" device]] for his actions that were described in his award citation:&lt;ref name="USCG1"&gt;[http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Point_Welcome.asp Coast Guard Historian's Office website - Patterson citation]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|
"The first attack caused a blazing gasoline fire on the fantail of the cutter that threatened to engulf the entire after section of the vessel. Chief Patterson, displaying the finest qualities of bravery and leadership, took charge of the situation and using a fire hose, forced the flaming liquid over the side, thus extinguishing the fire. Even as he was accomplishing this task, he saw the second aircraft attack rip through the pilot house killing the cutter's commanding officer and seriously wounding the executive officer and the helmsman. Unhesitatingly, and with complete disregard for his personal safety, Chief Patterson climbed to the bridge and took command. He ordered the crew to carry the wounded to the comparative safety of the below decks area. Alone on the bridge, he then maneuvered the cutter at high speed to avoid subsequent attacks. When it became apparent that he could not successfully evade the attacking aircraft, he ran the cutter close ashore, and directed the crew to abandon ship. Under his composed leadership, the wounded were wrapped in life jackets and paired with the able bodied before going over the side. Chief Patterson kept his crew calm and organized while they were in the water and until they were picked up by rescue craft."}}

''Point Caution'' came to the assistance of the ''Point Welcome'' and along with other units, rescued those in the water. Soon thereafter Patterson and those of his crew that were not seriously wounded returned to their cutter. They then sailed ''Point Welcome'' back to Danang under her own power.&lt;ref name=Larzelere27&gt;Larzelere, p 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CoastGuardsmen/&gt; She was repaired after a three-month overhaul and returned to service.&lt;ref name=Larzelere28&gt;Larzelere, p 28&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations by the [[Military Assistance Command Vietnam]] (MACV) involving 37 witnesses were conducted from the 15th through the 23rd of August 1966 and concluded with a statement to the [[Commandant of the Coast Guard]] that:&lt;ref name=Scotti110&gt;Scotti, p 110&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 the board of investigation issued its 159-page record and recommendations, including "That no disciplinary action be taken against any personnel involved in the incident." &lt;ref name=recordofproceedings&gt;Record of Proceedings...&lt;/ref&gt; And further:&lt;ref name=recordofproceedings /&gt;

{{quotation|
"It is evident from the record that there was a lack of coordination between different component forces operating in the same area, and that existing orders and instructions pertaining to identification and recognition of friendly forces were not observed."}}

===Tet 1968 action===
On 29 February and 1 March 1968, ''Point Welcome'' assisted in the destruction of an SL-class [[North Vietnam]]ese trawler near [[Cu Lao Re]] island,&lt;ref name=Kelley5-125&gt;Kelley, p 5-125&lt;/ref&gt; {{convert|70|mi|km}} southeast of [[Danang]].&lt;ref name=Larzelere128&gt;Larzelere, p 128&lt;/ref&gt; On the afternoon of 29 February 1968 the {{USCGC|Androscoggin|WHEC-68|6}} took the trawler under surveillance after it was first detected by a [[P-2 Neptune]] aircraft {{convert|150|mi|km}} south of the demilitarized zone. ''Point Welcome'' and {{USCGC|Point Grey|WPB-82324|2}}, along with two [[U.S. Navy]] [[Patrol Craft Fast|swift boats]], waited close to shore as the trawler approached, with ''Androscoggin'' trailing. In the early morning of 1 March 1968 as the trawler closed to within seven miles (11&amp;nbsp;km) of the coast, ''Androscoggin'' closed and challenged the trawler. After receiving no response, ''Androscoggin'' illuminated the target with {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on}} star shells. The trawler, positively identified as a North Vietnamese SL-class vessel, opened fire on the cutter with recoilless rifle and machine gun fire.  ''Androscoggin'' then opened fire with her {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on}} battery, scoring one hit on the trawler's "after starboard side."  The trawler then headed for the beach. Two helicopters took the trawler under fire while the 82-footers and swift boats closed. ''Point Welcome'' illuminated the target with illumination rounds fired from her 81-mm mortar while ''Point Grey'' and the swift boats fired their .50 caliber machine guns into the trawler. It grounded {{convert|50|yd|m}} from the mouth of the [[Song Tha Cau]] river.  ''Point Welcome'' then hit the target with two high explosive mortar rounds from her 81-mm mortar. The trawler soon thereafter exploded, leaving little trace.&lt;ref name=Larzelere129&gt;Larzelere, p 129&lt;/ref&gt;  The cutters were hit with debris but suffered no personnel casualties.&lt;ref name=Larzelere129&gt;Larzelere, p 129&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnamization===
She was transferred to the [[Republic of Vietnam Navy]] as RVNS ''Nguyễn Hấn'' (HQ-717), 29 April 1970.&lt;ref name=Scotti212&gt;Scotti, p 212&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aims and functions ==

UNODC was established to assist the UN in better addressing a coordinated, comprehensive response to the interrelated issues of illicit traficking in and abuse of drugs, crime prevention and criminal justice, international terrorism, and political corruption These goals are pursued through three primary functions: research, guidance and support to governments in the adoption and implementation of various crime-, drug-, terrorism-, and corruption-related conventions, treaties and protocols, as well as technical/financial assistance to said governments to face their respective situations and challenges in these fields.

The office aims long-term to better equip governments to handle drug-, [[crime]]-, [[terrorism]]-, and [[corruption]]-related issues, to maximise knowledge on '''these''' '''issues''' among governmental institutions and agencies, and also to maximise awareness of said matters in public opinion, globally, nationally and at community level. Approximately 90% of the Office's funding comes from voluntary ''contributions'', mainly from governments.

These are the main themes that UNODC deals with: Alternative Development, [[anti-corruption]], [[Criminal justice|Criminal Justice]], [[Prison reform|Prison Reform]] and [[Crime prevention|Crime Prevention]], Drug Prevention, -Treatment and Care, [[HIV/AIDS|HIV and AIDS]], [[Human trafficking|Human Trafficking]] and [[People smuggling|Migrant Smuggling]], [[Money laundering|Money Laundering]], [[Organized crime|Organized Crime]], [[Piracy]], Terrorism Prevention.

== The World Drug Report ==

The World Drug Report is a yearly publication that presents a comprehensive assessment of the international drug problem, with detailed information on the illicit drug situation. It provides estimates and information on trends in the production, trafficking and use of opium/heroin, coca/cocaine, cannabis and amphetamine-type stimulants. The Report, based on data and estimates collected or prepared by Governments, UNODC and other international institutions, attempts to identify trends in the evolution of global illicit drug markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=World Drug Report - Global Illicit Drug Trends |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/data-and-analysis/WDR.html |publisher=UNODC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the World Drug Report, UNODC aims to enhance Member States' understanding of global illicit drug trends and increase their awareness of the need for the more systematic collection and reporting of data relating to illicit drugs.

== Treaties ==

United Nations Conventions and their related Protocols underpin all the operational work of UNODC.

=== Crime-related treaties ===

==== United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols Thereto ====
The United Nations [[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]] is a legally binding instrument that entered into force on 29 September 2003, through which States parties commit to taking a series of measures against transnational organized crime. States that ratify the convention has the duty of creation of domestic offences to combat the problem, the adoption of new, sweeping frameworks for mutual legal assistance, extradition, law enforcement cooperation, technical assistance and training. The convention signifies an important stage in dealing with transnational crime by recognizing the seriousness of the problem that the crime poses, and gaining understanding from the member states of the importance of a cooperative measure. The convention is complemented by three different protocols: 

* the [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]]; 
* the [[Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air]]; and
* the [[Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, their Parts and Components and Ammunition]].

The [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]] aims to provide a convergence in the states' domestic offences in the investigation and the persecution process. Another objective of the protocol is to protect the victims of trafficking in persons with full respect.

The [[Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air]] is concerned with the aggravating problem of organized crime groups for smuggling persons. The protocol aims to combat and prevent transnational smuggling as well as to promote cooperative measures for enhancing protective measures for victims.

The [[Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, their Parts and Components and Ammunition]] was adopted to prevent and provide a cooperative measure for illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition. By adopting the protocol, the member states commit to adopt domestic criminal offences for illegal manufacturing, providing governmental licensing ammunition, and keeping track of the ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols Thereto,2000 |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CTOC/index.html|publisher=UNODC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United Nations Convention against Corruption ====
{{Main article|United Nations Convention against Corruption}}
In its resolution 55/61, the General Assembly recognized that an effective international legal instrument against corruption, independent of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime was desirable. The text of the Convention was negotiated during seven sessions held between 21 January 2002 and 1 October 2003. The Convention was adopted by the General Assembly on 31 October 2003.
In 2003, the United Nations adopted the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC). The Convention came into force in December 2005. As of 9 November 2012, 140 countries had signed and 164 countries (States Parties) had ratified the UNCAC. UNODC serves as the Secretariat for the Conference of the States Parties (CoSP) to the UNCAC.

UNODC, as the custodian of UNCAC, is also one of the main initiators of the establishment of the [[International Anti-Corruption Academy]] (IACA), whose main function is to, among other things, facilitate more effective implementation of the UNCAC.

=== Drug-related treaties ===
[[File:Treaty decades.png|thumb|Timeline of the three Drug-related treaties]]
There are three drug related treaties that guide UNODC's drug related programs. These are: The [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] of 1961 as amended by the 1972 Protocol ; the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] of 1971 and the [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]] of 1988.

These three major international drug control treaties are mutually supportive and complementary. An important purpose of the first two treaties is to codify internationally applicable control measures in order to ensure the availability of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances for medical and scientific purposes, and to prevent their diversion into illicit channels. They also include general provisions on trafficking and drug abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 |url=http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/conv/convention_1961_en.pdf |publisher=INCB |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131143416/http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/conv/convention_1961_en.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971 |url=http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/conv/convention_1971_en.pdf |publisher=INCB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, 1988 |url=http://www.unodc.org/pdf/convention_1988_en.pdf |publisher=UNODC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaigns ==
UNODC launches campaigns to raise awareness of drugs and crime problems. On 26 June every year, UNODC marks the [[International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking]]. 
On 9 December every year, UNODC commemorates the [[International Anti-Corruption Day]].

=== "Do Drugs Control Your Life"? – World Drug Campaign ===
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) started this international campaign to raise awareness about the major challenge that illicit drugs represent to society as a whole, and especially to the young. The goal of the campaign is to mobilize support and to inspire people to act against drug abuse and trafficking. The campaign encourages young people to put their health first and not to take drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=About the World Drug Campaign |url=http://www.unodc.org/drugs/en/about-the-world-drug-campaign/index.html |publisher=UNODC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Your No Counts" – International Anti-Corruption Campaign ===
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has teamed up with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to run this campaign as a focus on how corruption hinders efforts to achieve the internationally agreed upon MDGs, undermines democracy and the rule of law, leads to human rights violations, distorts markets, erodes quality of life and allows organized crime, terrorism and other threats to human security to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=ACT Against Corruption: About the Campaign |url=http://www.unodc.org/yournocounts/en/about-the-campaign/index.html |publisher=UNODC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Think AIDS" – World AIDS Campaign ===
Young people aged 15 to 24 account for an estimated 40 per cent of new adult (15+) HIV infections worldwide. In some parts of the world, and in some marginalized sub-groups, the most frequent modes of HIV transmission for these young people are unsafe injecting drug use and unsafe sexual activities.

Because young people are also often more likely to use drugs, The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) targets this population with a campaign to raise awareness about drug use and its connection to the spread of HIV and AIDS. The slogan: "Think Before You Start ... Before You Shoot ... Before You Share" is used to provoke young people to consider the implications of using drugs, and particularly injecting drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What is Think AIDS? |url=http://www.unodc.org/thinkaids/what-is-think-aids.html |publisher=UNODC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blue Heart Campaign Against Human Trafficking ===
The Blue Heart Campaign seeks to encourage involvement and action to help stop trafficking in persons. The campaign also allows people to show solidarity with the victims of human trafficking by wearing the Blue Heart. The use of the blue UN colour demonstrates the commitment of the United Nations to combat this crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=What is the Blue Heart Campaign? |url=http://www.unodc.org/blueheart/en/about-us.html |publisher=UNODC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
In 2007, the five largest donors to UNODC's budget in descending order were: [[European Union]], [[Canada]], [[United States]], the UN itself, and [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c6/12/16/26/48e55079.pdf |title=Svensk bedömning av multilaterala organisationer - FN:s organ mot brott och narkotika, UNODC |page=2 |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sweden |year=2008 |language=Swedish |trans-title=Swedish assessment of multilateral organizations - United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, UNODC |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612204317/http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c6/12/16/26/48e55079.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Transnational Institute]] this explains why, until recently, UNODC did not promote [[harm reduction]] policies like [[needle exchange]] and [[Heroin-assisted treatment]]. (This despite the actions of [[United Nations]] bodies (i.e. [[WHO]] and [[UNAIDS]]), who support these policies.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The United Nations and Harm Reduction Overview and Links |url=http://www.tni.org/detail_page.phtml?page=drugsreform-docs_unharmred |publisher=TNI}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNODC promotes other methods for drug use prevention, treatment and care that UNODC sees as "based on scientific evidence and on ethical standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/drug-prevention-and-treatment/index.html |title=Drug use prevention, treatment and care |publisher=UNODC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The UNODC has been criticized by human rights organizations such as [[Amnesty international]]  for not promoting the inclusion of adherence to international human rights standards within its project in [[Iran]]. Amnesty states that in Iran there are "serious concerns regarding unfair trials and executions of those suspected of drug offences in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Addicted to death: Executions for drug offenses in Iran |publisher=Amnesty International |year=2011 |url=http://www.amnesty.nl/sites/default/files/public/mde130902011en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

In June 2012, [[Mohammad Reza Rahimi]] the Iranian Vice President made some controversial remarks during a speech at a UNODC Drugs and Crime conference in Tehran.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-israel-iran-speech-idUSBRE85Q1B020120627 "Israel accuses Iran of anti-Semitism after drug speech"], 'Reuters', 27 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|"The Islamic Republic of Iran will pay for anybody who can research and find one single Zionist who is an addict. They do not exist," he said. "This is the proof of their involvement in drugs trade."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2012/jun/28/uk-iran-anti-semitic-remarks "UK condemns Iranian vice president for anti-semitic remarks"], 'The Guardian', 28 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He then went on to blame the [[Talmud]], a key Jewish religious text, for the expansion of illegal drugs around the world and said that it teaches to "destroy everyone who opposes the Jews."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/27/world/middleeast/irans-vice-president-rahimi-makes-anti-semitic-speech.html "Iran’s Vice President Makes Anti-Semitic Speech at Forum"], 'The Washington Post', 26 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahimi was widely condemned for his controversial remarks:

*[[European Union]] [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]] [[Catherine Ashton]] called his remarks "unacceptable" and reaffirmed the European Union's "absolute commitment to combating racism and anti-Semitism." Ashton went on to say that "the High Representative is deeply disturbed by racist and anti-Semitic statements made by Iranian First Vice President Mohammed Reza Rahimi at the U.N. International Day against Drug Abuse".&lt;ref name="cbn.com"&gt;[http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2012/June/Iranian-VPs-Anti-Semitic-Tirade-Bombs-with-EU/ "Iranian VP's Anti-Semitic Tirade Bombs with EU"], 'CBN News', 28 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
*The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement saying that he had "...on many occasions called on Iranian officials to refrain from these kinds of anti-Semitic statements...[and] believes it is the responsibility of leaders to promote harmony and understanding and he deeply regrets expressions of hatred and religious intolerance."&lt;ref name="cbn.com"/&gt;
*The Minister for Middle East in the UK Alastair Burt said "We condemn utterly the baseless comments from Iran's Vice-President Rahimi about the Talmud and the Jewish faith, made at a United Nations drugs control event in Tehran this week. Racism and anti-semitism are unacceptable in any circumstance, let alone at an event sponsored by the United Nations. We call upon Iran to correct this scandalous statement, and to ensure that its officials respect the proper international norms and standards in the future."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/britain-condemns-antisemitic-remarks-by-irans-vicepresident-7896728.html "Britain condemns anti-semitic remarks by Iran's vice-president"], 'The Independent', 28 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
*Israeli Foreign Minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]] said that "Israel would not allow any Jew to be harmed."&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt;

'''Uskoreniye''' ({{lang-rus|ускоре́ние|p=ʊskɐˈrʲenʲɪɪ}}; literally meaning ''acceleration'') was a slogan and a policy announced by [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] on 20 April 1985 at a Soviet Party Plenum, aimed at the acceleration of political, social and economic development of the [[Soviet Union]]. It was the first slogan of a set of reforms that also included  ''[[perestroika]]'' (restructuring), ''[[glasnost]]'' (transparency), ''[[new political thinking]]'', and ''[[democratisation (Soviet Union)|democratisation]]''.

In May 1985, Gorbachev gave a speech in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], during which he admitted the slowing down of the economic development and inadequacy of living standards. This was the first time in history that a Soviet leader had done so.

The program was furthered at the [[27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|27th Congress of the Communist Party]] in Gorbachev's report to the congress, in which he spoke about "perestroika", "uskoreniye", "[[Human factors|human factor]]", "glasnost", and "expansion of the [[khozraschyot]]" (commercialization). The acceleration was planned to be based on technical and scientific progress, revamping of [[heavy industry]] (in accordance with the [[Marxian economics]] postulate about the primacy in development of heavy industry over [[light industry]]), taking the "human factor" into account, and increasing the labour discipline and responsibility of [[apparatchik]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bibliotekar.ru/mihail-gorbachev/64.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In practice it was implemented with the help of massive monetary emission infused into heavy industry, which further destabilised the economy and in particular brought an enormous disparity between actual cash money and virtual money used in cashless clearings (безналичный расчёт) between enterprises and state and among enterprises.

The politics of mere "acceleration" eventually failed, which was ''de facto'' admitted in June 1987 at a Party Plenum, and the "uskoreniye" slogan was phased out in favor of the more ambitious "[[Perestroika]]" (restructuring of the whole economy).

[[Image:392wetdown.jpg|thumb|200px|Great River Fire Department's first due engine being wetdown.]]

A '''wetdown''' is a ritual celebrated by many [[volunteer fire department]]s in the [[United States]] in which squads of [[firefighter]]s from neighboring towns ritualistically commission a new [[fire apparatus]] by anointing it with water sprayed from the visitors' [[firefighting]] equipment.

If two new apparatus' are commissioned, then it is considered to be a "Double Wetdown". If three new apparatus' are commissioned, then it is called a "Triple Wetdown". Or if four new apparatus' are commissioned, then it is considered as a "Quadruple Wetdown".

==Tournament history==

===2016===
As of March 2016, qualifying rounds for the first edition were expected to begin in April 2016.&lt;ref name="Custer"/&gt; 

Despite the large prize pools, many top contenders were not at the event, especially with CS:GO's first major of 2017 right around the corner. WESG 2016 for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) was the last premier tournament before the [[ELEAGUE Major 2017]]. France's Team EnVyUs beat out Poland's Team Kinguin to take home the majority of CS:GO's biggest prize pool while Poland's number one took third place by defeating Turkey's Space Soldiers before booking a ticket to [[Atlanta]] for the major. In Dota 2, the Filipino team TNC Pro Team downed Denmark's Cloud9 to take the grand prize. Alliance from Sweden took down Peru's hopeful Infamous to take the bronze. In Starcraft 2, Koreans dominated as expected as Jun "TY" Tae-yang defeated compatriot Cho "Maru" Seong-ju. In the third place match, America's Alex "Neeb" Sunderhaft took down Tobias "ShoWTimE" Sieber of Germany. Hearthstone's champion was the Philippines's Euneil "Staz" Javiñas took down Sweden's Jon "Orange" Westberg in a close grand final. The third place match featured two Germans, and it was Raphael "BunnyHoppor" Peltzer to topple Sebastian "Xixo" Bentert.

===2017===
Despite being called WESG 2017, the event took place in March 2018.

In CS:GO, with the major already past, more top teams showed up. However, teams such as [[SK Gaming]] from Brazil, which was the second most decorated team in CS:GO and world number two, and Cloud9 from the United States, which was the [[ELEAGUE Major: Boston 2018|reigning major champions]] and world number three, were knocked out earlier than expected while teams such as MVP PK from South Korea and Team One from Brazil, two teams that hadn't even qualified for the major, made it much further into the bracket than expected. Sweden's Fnatic came back from a large deficit against the Space Soldiers from Turkey to take home the WESG 2017 title for Fnatic's second straight premier tournament win. Team Russia stopped the [[Cinderella (sports)|Cinderella story]] of Team One in the third place match. Dota 2 saw Team Russia take out Brazil's paiN Gaming. Team Hellas from Greece shut down the hometown Rock.Y from China in the third place match. South Korea dominated again in Starcraft 2 as Maru redeemed himself from last year after being the runner-up to winning the title after taking down compatriot Park "Dark" Ryung-woo. Kim "Classic" Doh-woo could not make it three Koreans in a row as he fell to Finland's [[Joona Sotala|Joona "Serral" Sotala]] in the third place match. Hearthstone saw Turkey's Kaan "Fujitora" Çekli defeat Michael "Luker" Luker from Canada to take home the grand prize. The unknown posesi from Japan took third place after defeating Thailand's Kantaphon "ScreaM" Suwanmalee. CS:GO's female grand final saw a close series as Russian Forces scraped past LLG Gaming of China to take home all but {{usd}}100,000 of the prize pool. In the third place match, Those Damn Canadians defeated the experienced Team Sweden. Hearthstone's female grand final featured the two Chinese qualifiers as GLHuiHui defeated Lioon. Cordelia "Scarakye" Chui from UK lost HongKong's Ip Yan in the third place match.

{{World-Scrabble-Championship | year=2003 | date-from=21 October 2003 | date-to=24 October 2003| location=[[Kuala Lumpur]] | winner=Panupol Sujjayakorn | number-of-players=90 | sponsor=Mattel | next=2005 | previous=2001 }}

The '''World Scrabble Championship 2003''' was held in the [http://www.corushotelkl.com/ Corus Hotel], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]]. The winner was Panupol Sujjayakorn of [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name=wsc2003&gt;http://www.wscgames.com/2003/prizes.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The format was notably different from previous [[World Scrabble Championship|WSCs]]. The tournament began with the [[Swiss_system_tournament#Scrabble|Australian Draw]] system, with each player playing sixteen games over two days. On the third day the players played eight games in a [[Swiss_system_tournament#Scrabble|King Of the Hill]] format. After this, the top two players competed in a best-of-five final to decide who would be the seventh World Scrabble Champion.

Prize money started at $17,500 for the winner, with all the top twenty players receiving prizes down to $200.

==Results==

The winner was [[Panupol Sujjayakorn]] of [[Thailand]]. This was the first time that a player won the WSC while representing a country for which [[English language|English]] is not the first language.
