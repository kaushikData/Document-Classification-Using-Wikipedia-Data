{{History of the Republic of China}}

The '''1987 Lieyu massacre''', also known as the '''March 7 Incident''', '''Donggang Incident''' or '''Donggang Massacre''', occurred on 7 March 1987 at Donggang Bay, [[Lieyu, Fujian|Lieyu]] Island ("Lesser Kinmen" or "Little Quemoy"), [[Kinmen]], [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian]], [[Republic of China]]. According to the diary of [[Four-star rank|General]] [[Hau Pei-tsun]], nineteen unarmed [[Vietnamese boat people]] were killed by the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|ROC military]]. There may have been more than nineteen deaths.

==Background==
{{See also|Chinese Civil War|Taiwan Strait Crisis|Two Chinas|Martial law in Taiwan}}
The 1987 Lieyu massacre was preceded by an incident where a young couple from mainland China swam to [[Dadan Island]] (大膽島) seeking [[Right of asylum|asylum]]. At that time, all the islets of the Kinmen [[Archipelago]] were considered as war zones under [[Martial Law]], which was to allow the [[Republic of China (Taiwan)]] to prevent an attack by the [[People's Liberation Army]] of the [[Communist Party of China]]. The commanding [[major-general]] of the Dadan Defense Team, Premier deputy division commander of the 158 Lieyu [[Division (military)|Division]] (烈嶼師), received the couple and escorted them to the superior-level Kinmen Defense Command (金防部), but was immediately relieved of his post for violating the directive to "Accept no [[surrender (military)|surrender]] in the war zone".

As a result, the commanding [[lieutenant-colonel]] of the neighboring [[Erdan Island]], Deputy brigade commander of the 473 Brigade, summoned all the soldiers to reiterate the order that "Whoever lands on the island must be executed without exception". Soon after this, he was promoted to the position of 472 Nantang [[brigade commander]] (南塘旅), taking charge of all the units in the South [[Lieyu, Kinmen|Lieyu]] Defense Team.

At noon on 28 February 1987, one week before the Lieyu massacre, a local Chinese [[fishing boat]] crossed [[Xiamen Bay]]. It was intensely fired upon till caught fire near [[Dadan Island]]. The [[fishermen]] on board waved a white cloth in an attempt to communicate their surrender. However, the boat was sunk by [[tank gun]] shots ordered by the new Dadan commander colonel, Secondary deputy division commander of the 158 Division, upon receiving the approval of the Kinmen Defense Command. There was only one survivor swam to cling on a [[Rock (geology)|rock]] nearby, but was eventually lost to the waves.

==Massacre==
On 7 March 1987, a boat carrying Vietnamese refugees arrived in [[Kinmen]] requesting [[political asylum]]. The request was rejected by the Kinmen Defense Command. The boat was towed away from the shore by a patrol boat of the [[Amphibious reconnaissance|Amphibious Reconnaissance]] [[Battalion]] (ARB-101, 海龍蛙兵) with a warning not to return. However, for reasons unclear, the information about the boat's presence in the Southern sea was never forwarded to the front line of the coastal defense units, including those in the [[Lieyu, Kinmen|Lieyu]] island.

At 16:37 in the afternoon of 7 March 1987, under heavy [[fog]], the Vietnamese boat was sighted off the shore of [[Lieyu, Kinmen|Lieyu]]. The 472 [[brigade]] commander and the local 1st Dashanding (大山頂) infantry [[battalion]] commander arrived at the scene with staff officers. Warning shots were fired by the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|ROC military]].  The Vietnamese boat landed on the beach south-west of Donggang ("East Cape", Chinese: 東崗; Pinyin: Dōnggāng) Port (Fort 05). It was hit by crossfire and two [[bazooka]] shots by the WPN company in reinforcement. [[Armor-piercing shell]]s penetrated the wooden [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] without [[explosion]]. Three unarmed Vietnamese men jumped off the boat, raised their hands, and said in Chinese, "Don't shoot..." but were all shot dead instantly.

The local 3rd Dongang [[Company (military unit)|company]] commander on site received an order from the brigade commander to lead a search team boarding the boat.  Two [[hand grenades]] were thrown into the boat. The commander then found that all the passengers were [[Vietnam]]ese refugees with no weapon. The passengers said the vessel had experienced a mechanical failure. Because of the heavy fog, the strong seasonal [[Ocean current|currents]] and the rising [[tide]] since late afternoon, the boat drifted into the bay. The surviving passengers and the bodies of the dead were taken out of the boat and placed on the beach with neither [[first aid]] nor any [[life support]] supply rendered. Followed by intense [[telecommunication]] with the division HQ, the commanders at the scene received orders from their superiors to execute the passengers to eliminate all the eyewitnesses. Some received multiple shots when one bullet did not kill. Among the bodies piled were elderly, women, one [[pregnant]], children, and a baby in a [[sweater]].

In the morning 09:00 of 8 March 1987, the [[Medic]]al [[Platoon]] of the [[Headquarters and Headquarters Company|battalion HQ Company]] was called in to bury all the bodies at the beach. The platoon members were ordered to execute any surviving refugees. The wounded were buried alive, and those who were still moving or crying were dictated to be killed by military shovels. The entire boat was also instructed to be burned down aside from the only propeller non-flammable to gasoline, then all buried in sand to destroy all the evidence right away. The last victim, a little boy being hidden underneath a board cell was also executed by order without exception. The guarding [[sergeant]] of the battalion HQ company counted the bodies as more than nineteen.

Since some [[Combat Medic|medics]] defied the direct order of victim execution, the [[brigade commander]] instructed the Nantang [[Headquarters and Headquarters Company|brigade HQ Company]] commander captain to dispatch soldiers taking over the [[battalion]] HQ and the battalion HQ company as emergency measure.  Later that day, another fishing boat from [[China]] approached the coast attempting to check out what happened. it was also shot to destroy, and sunk in the open sea with 4 confirmed kills to assure all lips sealed - which some veterans later called the "March 8 Incident".&lt;ref&gt;Ah-hsin, 158D veteran, "20th Memorial to the Donggang Incident", (阿信 [http://natac.pixnet.net/blog/post/99733293-%E6%9D%B1%E5%B4%97%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6%E4%BA%8C%E5%8D%81%E9%80%B1%E5%B9%B4 《東崗事件二十週年》]，難得緣份～金誠連部落格), Mar. 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten weeks later, the [[President of the Republic of China]] (Taiwan), [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], reacted to concealment of the massacre by the 158 [[Division (military)|Division]] and the Kinmen Defense Command. Commander of the Kinmen Defense Command, [[General]] Zhao Wan-fu (Chinese: 趙萬富; Pinyin: Zhào Wànfù), said he was unaware of the event. While being questioned by the Chief of the General Staff, [[General]] [[Hau Pei-tsun]], Zhao Wan-fu lied, "It was just a couple of 'Communist soldiers' (referring to the penetration of [[People's Liberation Army]]) being shot in the water", but Zhao's statement was obviously unbelievable. Then [[General]] [[Hau Pei-tsun]] ordered the [[exhumation]] of the corpses from the first scene, moved them toward a higher hidden slope to the right, filled with [[cement]] and built a concrete wall above it to prevent any future investigation. The corpses remain sealed in the final place with no tomb today.

==Revelation==
The bodies were not buried deeply on the first scene. Influenced by tidal [[seawater]] and high temperatures, the bodies soon began to [[decompose]] and were dug out by [[wild dog]]s from the [[landfill]] on the back side of the western hill. Accounts of [[ghost]] sightings prompted villagers to hold religious ceremonies, making it all the more difficult to block the news.

In early May 1987, the [[British Hong Kong]] newspaper ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' first reported the massacre. Informed by the overseas office, higher officials questioned the Kinmen Defense Command but got no concrete response; instead, the Command swapped this coast defense [[battalion]] from the front line with another reserve battalion in the training base in urgency in order to strengthen the personnel control and communication restriction to prevent further leaking news, and their unit designation codes were also shifted for the following years to confuse outsiders. Twice of [[bribery|extra bonus]] cash summing up to half a month of a [[captain]]'s salary, $6000 were also abnormally awarded to the [[company commander]]s against the government ethics on the eve of [[Dragon boat festival]]. Until the end of May, recently discharged [[conscription|conscript]] soldiers from Kinmen began to arrive in Taiwan Proper by the term schedule and finally able to appeal to the newly founded [[opposition party]], [[Democratic Progressive Party]]. The information of the massacre started to spread in Taiwan.

On 5 June 1987, ''[[Independence Evening Post]]'' was the first Taiwanese newspaper reporting the massacre with the formal questioning by the newly elected [[Parliament Member]] [[Wu Shu-chen]] from the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] to the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] during the general assembly of [[Legislative Yuan]].  Her questions were repeatedly denied by the Military Spokesman, [[Major-general]] Zhang Hui Yuan, who accused Wu of "sabotaging the national reputation", and claimed it was actually "a Chinese [[fishing boat]] being sunk in the sea after ignoring the warnings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | script-title=zh:大陸民主鬥士，非請莫入 | author=文現深 | url=http://store.gvm.com.tw/magazine_information_38.html |work=Global Views Monthly《遠見雜誌》| issue=Vol.38 }} Aug. 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The case has been classified as military secret ever since for 20 years to prevent any further leaking information or the prosecution will apply.&lt;ref&gt;Yung-yuan, [http://home.gamer.com.tw/creationDetail.php?sn=3018241 "Related reportage entries on March 7 Incident"]《三七事件相關報導》clipping data, Bahamut, Nov. 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The official [[cover-up]] story of the Chinese fishing boat sunk by one shell of bombardment applied to the public for another 13 years, until being uncovered by the publication of «''Diary of the Chief of the General Staff (1981-1989)''» by General Hau in 2000. The [[Government of the Republic of China]] has made [[no comment]] thereafter.

==Aftermath==
After the scandal was exposed, President [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] received a letter from [[Amnesty International]] expressing [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] concern, and assigned the Chief of General Staff, General Hau, to investigate this case. A special envoy of the [[Political Warfare Bureau]] was dispatched to Kinmen and found the case true.  All the commanders and the corresponding political officers along the chain of command, including [[Kinmen]] Defense Command, 158 [[Lieyu, Kinmen|Lieyu]] [[Division (military)|Division]], 472 Nantang [[Brigade]], the 1st Dashanding [[Battalion]], the HQ, WPN and 3rd Donggang companies were detained and brought back to [[Taipei]], then only the division officers were charged in [[court martial]] in October, 1987.

Brigade Commander Zhong was sentenced to 1 year and 10 months for abetting murder; Battalion Commander Major Liu was sentenced to 1 year and 10 months for being an accomplice to murder; WPN and 3rd Company commanders, Captain Li and Captain Zhang, both were sentenced to 1 year and 8 months for murder - but all the sentences were commuted with a [[probation]] period of three years, therefore none of the convicted field commanders was required to spend a day in jail until later under heavy pressure from the international society and media. Their later regular [[retirement]] and [[pension]] plans were not affected.

The superior officers received no official punishment, and recovered their military career after President Chiang suddenly died in January, 1988. [[Brigade commander|Brigade Commander]] Zhong took a senior lead [[colonel]] position in a [[military academy]] (陸軍通校); [[Division (military)|Division]] Commander Gong shifted to the Chief of Staff of the War College, [[National Defense University (Republic of China)|National Defense University]], before being promoted to the Deputy Commander of the Hua-Tung Defense Command (花東防衛司令部) in 1991; Kinmen Defense Commander Zhao was promoted to Deputy Chief Commander [[Republic of China Army rank insignia|General]] of the [[Republic of China Army]] in 1989, and further to Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]] in 1991; then appointed with honours as a strategy advisor (戰略顧問) to the [[President of the Republic of China]] in 2 terms, and then the permanent title as the reviewer member (中評委) of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[ruling party]], [[Kuomintang]] ([[Chinese Nationalist Party]]) till his death on Feb. 28, 2016. His official funeral was proceeded with his coffin covered by the [[Flag of the Republic of China|National Flag]], the [[military salute]] of the top-ranked generals, and [[Vice-president]] [[Wu Den-yih]] presenting the Commendation Decree of [[President]] [[Ma Ying-jeou]], who praises Zhao's 50-year career in [[national security]] with so-called "[[loyalty]], [[diligence]], [[bravery]], [[Persistence (psychology)|perseverance]], [[intelligence]], [[wisdom]], [[insight]] and [[Effectiveness|proficiency]]" (忠勤勇毅，才識閎通), whereas "his [[virtue]] and [[Behavior|conducts]] have set a good example [[Role model|model]] for future generation to follow...." (武德景行，貽範永式... 逾五十載攄忠護民，越半世紀衛國干城，崇勛盛業，青史聿昭).&lt;ref&gt;Zhao Wan-fu, [[Baidu Encyclopedia]] name tag [http://baike.baidu.com/view/2081325.htm 《赵万富》], quoting the Historical Research of [[Nanhua County]], [[Yunnan]], 26 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[President]] [[Ma Ying-jeou]], [http://www.president.gov.tw/Default.aspx?tabid=131&amp;rmid=514&amp;itemid=36990 Commendation decree]，[[Office of the President of the Republic of China]], Mar. 25, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of the Republic of China]] has never rendered an [[Remorse|apology]] nor any [[Financial compensation|compensation]] to the victim families or the victim country.

== Biography ==
Originally trained in her home country of Spain, Bernabeu holds her LLM degree from the [[University Of Valencia]] School Of Law and is a member of the Valencia and Madrid Bar Associations, as well as the American Bar Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cja.org/section.php?id=91#Almudena%20Bernabeu|website=Center for Justice and Accountability|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernabeu is credited with success in more than a dozen high-profile human rights cases, including the Guatemala Genocide case crucial to the recent trial of former president [[Efraín Ríos Montt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elola|first1=Joseba|title=The genocidal master plan came earlier and Ríos Montt supplied the tactics|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2013/09/04/inenglish/1378302416_531650.html|accessdate=2 November 2015|agency=El Pais|date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Professional career ==
Bernabeu’s work led to Ríos Montt’s 2013 conviction for his part in the slaughter of nearly 2,000 Ixil Mayans in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Montgomery|first1=David|title=Hunting Dictators and Helping Prisoners: Human Rights Award Winners Reflect on the Sources of their Passion|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style-blog/wp/2015/10/07/hunting-dictators-and-helping-prisoners-human-rights-award-winners-reflect-on-the-sources-of-their-passion/|accessdate=2 November 2015|agency=Washington Post|date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, her work on that case was featured in the documentary ''Granito: How to Nail a Dictator''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rohter|first1=Larry|title=Old Footage Haunts General and a Director|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/movies/pamela-yatess-granito-revisits-guatemala.html?_r=0|accessdate=2 November 2015|agency=New York Times|date=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernabeu is also the lead prosecutor in the case against Salvadoran officials for the massacre of Jesuit priests in 1989.  In that incident, armed members of El Salvador’s military burst into the Jesuit residence at the Universidad Centroamericana in San Salvador and executed six Jesuit priests, a housekeeper and her daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burnett|first1=Victoria|title=Jesuit Killings in El Salvador Could Reach Trial in Spain|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/world/americas/14salvador.html|accessdate=2 November 2015|agency=New York Times|date=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Castillo|first1=Juan|title=25 Yrs After El Salvador Priest Killings, Groups Press For Justice|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/25-yrs-after-el-salvador-priest-killings-groups-press-justice-n247276|accessdate=2 November 2015|agency=NBC News|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernabeu’s work was instrumental in securing the 2015 deportation from Florida to El Salvador of [[Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova]], a former defense minister implicated in “extrajudicial killing and torture” during the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] of 1980-1992, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gamboa|first1=Suzanne|title=Deportation Upheld Of Salvadoran Ex-Official For Torture, Killings|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/former-el-salvador-defense-ministers-deportation-upheld-n321801|accessdate=2 November 2015|agency=NBC News|issue=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The team of lawyers working at G37 Despacho Internacional, together with its London partner Guernica37 International Justice Chambers, have investigated international crimes committed in Syria since March 2011, at the behest of victims’ families, in order to achieve accountability and promote a processes of transitional justice, after the end of hostilities.

On 31 January 2017, and as result of these investigations, G37 Despacho Internacional filed a complaint before the Spanish National Court against members of Syrian security forces and military intelligence on the basis of their alleged responsibility for the commission of a crime of State terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/world/europe/spain-syria-torture-case.html?_r=0|title=9 Syrian Officials Are Accused Of Torture in Spanish Court|last=|first=|date=2 February 2017|newspaper=New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|via=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complainant -the sister of a Syrian citizen arbitrarily detained, tortured and executed in a detention centre in Damascus- is a victim of Spanish nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/from-a-trove-of-grim-photos-a-case-against-assads-government/2017/02/01/728575d0-e8d7-11e6-bf6f-301b6b443624_story.html|title=A photo of her brother's corpse popped up on her phone.

In her acceptance of the 2015 Letelier-Moffitt Human Rights Award, Bernabeu explained her passion for bringing human rights violators to justice:

“I don’t want to take care of the poor or those who have been tortured or those who have been abused… I want this stupid world to stop abusing people…. I want to help the person whose child was disappeared — of course. But my strongest sense of who I am, if I want to be super-honest, is, how can I fight and tell the world that this [expletive] was actually ordering these disappearances and getting rid of these 18-year-old students?”&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Bernabeu has received several other awards for her international human rights work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8620">The '''American Committee for East–West Accord''' is the name of two related organizations that have existed during separate periods of American history whose goals have been to promote, in the [[United States]], conciliation with the [[Soviet Union]] and, later, the [[Russian Federation]]. 

==Original organization (1974–1992)==
The American Committee for East–West Accord was informally organized in 1974, and chartered three years later, in 1977. Founding members included [[George F. Kennan]], [[Stephen F. Cohen]], [[Jerome Wiesner]], and [[Theodore Hesburgh]].
The group, which was composed of businessmen, journalists, academics, and former elected officials, advanced the position that "common sense" should determine U.S. trade policy with the USSR, specifically, that the U.S. should avoid economic boycotts and sanctions against the Soviet Union as such measures rarely worked. Instead, it argued, expanding American-Soviet trade would help advance the cause of [[détente]]. It also supported the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] (SALT), increased scientific and cultural exchanges with the Soviet Union, and less confrontational rhetoric about the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baldwin|first1=David|title=Economic Statecraft|date=1985|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691101752|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Language of Foreign Affairs|date=1987|publisher=DIANE|isbn=0941375110|page=4|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=UqrS4U6VfYEC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graduate Student Ben Wallace Digitizes the Cold War|url=https://www.library.ohiou.edu/archive/2012/05/graduate-student-ben-wallace-digitizes-the-cold-war/|website=Ohio University Libraries|publisher=[[Ohio University]]|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the committee, its underlying perspective was support for the "resolute abandonment of the stale slogans and reflexes of the Cold War ... and a determination not to be governed by the compulsions of military competition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sanders|first1=Jerry|title=Peddlers of Crisis: The Committee on the Present Danger and the Politics of Containment|date=1983|publisher=South End Press|isbn=0896081818|page=179|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=K_h5GpTCR5wC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the committee's earliest activities was production of the film ''Survival ... or Suicide'' which presented a cinematic treatment of the effects [[nuclear war]] would have on daily life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Stephen|title=Survival ... or Suicide|work=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists ]]|date=September 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Cohen reestablished the American Committee for East–West Accord in 2015 with the assistance of [[Gilbert Doctorow]].&lt;ref name=b/&gt; A formal launch event was held in November of that year.&lt;ref name="db"/&gt; In addition to Cohen and Doctorow, other members of the group's board of directors include [[Donald McHenry]], [[William vanden Heuvel]], [[Bill Bradley]], [[Chuck Hagel]], [[Jack F. Matlock Jr.]], and [[John E. Pepper, Jr.]]&lt;ref name="db"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carden|first1=James|title=Could This New Group Stop the Rush to Cold War?|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/could-new-group-stop-rush-cold-war/|accessdate=November 6, 2016|work=[[The Nation]]|date=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board of Directors|url=http://eastwestaccord.com/board-of-directors/|website=American Committee on East–West Accord|publisher=American Committee on East–West Accord|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carden|first1=James|title=Could This New Group Stop the Rush to Cold War?|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/could-new-group-stop-rush-cold-war/|accessdate=December 16, 2016|work=[[The Nation]]|date=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Doctorow subsequently resigned from the Board to pursue other interests. More recent Board members include Anna Eleanor Roosevelt (the granddaughter of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt) and Sharon Tension.

The impetus for reforming the committee was, according to its executive editor [[James Carden]], due to its perception that "anyone who has had the temerity to question whether NATO’s relentless expansion eastward to Russia’s borders has contributed to the crisis [in Ukraine], can look forward to being labeled a '[[useful idiot]]', a 'dupe', or a 'Kremlin apologist'. The trend towards character assassination in lieu of substantive debate has been one of the defining features of the debate over US–Russia policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carden|first1=James|title=Taking on Russia|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/blog/2015/07/01/taking-russia|accessdate=December 16, 2016|work=World Policy|date=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purpose===
The organization was established with the intent of encouraging discussion and debate in the U.S. at a time when the United States has started drifting into a new Cold War with Russia. see: http://jordanrussiacenter.org/event-recaps/american-committee-east-west-accord-encourages-debate-u-s-russian-relations/#.W-G5DK2ZPq0

===Reaction===
The committee has been endorsed by [[Paul Craig Roberts]], though others have criticized the group for what they say is its tendency to "blame all tensions on the west".&lt;ref name="db"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Paul|title=Propaganda Reigns In The West|url=http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2015/06/23/guest-column-vladimir-putin-3/|accessdate=December 16, 2016|work=paulcraigroberts.com|date=June 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anton Drexler''' (13 June 1884 – 24 February 1942) was a [[German people|German]] [[Far-right politics|far-right]] political leader of the 1920s who founded the [[Pan-Germanism|pan-German]] and [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP), the antecedent of the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP). Drexler mentored his successor in the NSDAP, [[Adolf Hitler]], during his early years in politics.

==Early life==
Born in [[Munich]], Drexler was a machine-fitter before becoming a railway toolmaker and [[locksmith]] in [[Berlin]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} He joined the [[German Fatherland Party]] during [[World War I]].{{sfn|Hamilton|1984|p=219}} 

==Politics==

===Early involvement in politics===
In March 1918, Drexler founded a branch of Free Workers' Committee for a Good Peace (''Der Freie Arbeiterausschuss für einen guten Frieden'') league.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} [[Karl Harrer]], a journalist and member of the [[Thule Society]], convinced Drexler and several others to form the [[Politischer Arbeiter-Zirkel|Political Workers' Circle]] (''Politischer Arbeiter-Zirkel'') in 1918.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} The members met periodically for discussions with themes of [[nationalism]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitism]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} Drexler was a poet and a member of the [[Völkisch movement|völkisch]] agitators. 

===Founding of the German Workers' Party===
Together with Harrer, [[Gottfried Feder]] and [[Dietrich Eckart]], he founded the German Workers' Party (DAP) in Munich on 5 January 1919.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}}

At a DAP meeting in Munich in September 1919, the main speaker was [[Gottfried Feder]]. When Feder's talk concluded, Adolf Hitler got involved in a heated political argument with a visitor, Professor Baumann, who questioned the soundness of Feder's arguments against [[capitalism]] and proposed that [[Bavaria]] should break away from [[Prussia]] and found a new South German nation with [[Austria]]. In vehemently attacking the man's arguments, Hitler made an impression on the other party members with his [[Public speaking|oratory]] skills, and according to him, the professor left the hall acknowledging defeat.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=75}} Drexler approached Hitler and gave him a copy of his pamphlet ''My Political Awakening'', which contained anti-Semitic, nationalist, [[anti-capitalist]], and anti-Marxist ideas.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} Hitler claims the literature reflected the ideals he already believed in.&lt;ref&gt;Hitler, Adolf. ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed with Hitler, Drexler encouraged him to join the DAP. On the orders of his army superiors, Hitler applied to join the party.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=170}}

Once accepted, Hitler began to make the party more public, and he organized their biggest meeting yet of 2,000 people, for 24 February 1920 in the [[Staatliches Hofbräuhaus in München|Hofbräuhaus]] in Munich. It was in this speech that Hitler, for the first time, enunciated the [[National Socialist Program#German Party program|twenty-five points of the ''German Worker's Party'''s manifesto]] that he had authored with Drexler and Feder.&lt;ref&gt;Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Through these points he gave the organisation a much bolder stratagem&lt;ref&gt;Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; with a clear foreign policy, including the abrogation of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], a [[German Question|Greater Germany]], Eastern expansion, exclusion of Jews from citizenship. On the same day the party was renamed the National Socialist German Workers' Party (''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei''; NSDAP).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=87}} The significance of this particular move in publicity moved Karl Harrer to resign from the party in disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an intraparty dispute, Hitler angrily tendered his resignation on 11 July 1921. The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=100, 101, 102}} Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=103}} The committee agreed; he rejoined the party as member 3,680. Drexler was thereafter moved to the purely symbolic position of honorary president and left the party in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Drexler was also a member of a ''[[Völkisch movement|völkisch]]'' political club for affluent members of Munich society known as the [[Thule Society]]. His membership in the Nazi Party ended when it was temporarily outlawed in 1923 following the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] despite Drexler not actually having taken part in the coup attempt. In 1924 he was elected to the Bavarian state parliament for another party, in which he served as vice president until 1928. He played no role in the Nazi Party's re-founding in 1925 and rejoined only after Hitler ascended to national power in 1933.{{sfn|Hamilton|1984|p=220}} He founded a splinter group, the ''Nationalsozialer Volksbund'', but this dissolved in 1928.{{sfn|Zentner|Bedürftig|1991|p=209}} He received the party's [[Blood Order]] in 1934 and was still occasionally used as a [[Nazi propaganda|propaganda]] tool until about 1937, but he was never allowed any legitimate power in the party.

==Death==
Drexler died in Munich in February 1942.{{sfn|Hamilton|1984|p=220}}

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Hisham Keris.jpeg|thumb|225px|In 2005, UMNO Youth Chief [[Hishamuddin Hussein]] brandished the ''[[kris]]'' (traditional Malay dagger) in defence of ''[[ketuanan Melayu]]'', the [[social contract (Malaysia)|social contract]] and Article 153.]] --&gt;
'''Article 153 of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]]''' grants the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (King of Malaysia) responsibility for “safeguard[ing] the special position of Malaysians{{ref|reference_name_A|(see note)}} and natives of any of the States of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] and the legitimate interests of other communities” and goes on to specify ways to do this, such as establishing [[Quota share|quotas]] for entry into the [[civil service]], public [[scholarship]]s and [[public education]].

Article 153 is one of the most controversial articles in the Malaysian constitution. Critics consider it to create an unnecessary and [[Racialism (racial categorization)|racialist]] distinction between Malaysians of different [[ethnic]] backgrounds, because it has led to the implementation of [[affirmative action]] policies which benefit only the [[Bumiputra]], who comprise a [[majoritarianism|majority]] of the population. Technically, discussing the [[repeal]] of Article 153 is illegal&lt;ref name="Means, pp. 14, 15"&gt;Means, pp. 14, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;—even in [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]], although it was drafted as a temporary provision to the Constitution. Despite this prohibition on discussion, the article is heatedly debated both privately and publicly among [[Malaysia]]ns, against the implementation of the article although ostensibly maintaining support for it. Nevertheless, the article is viewed as a sensitive matter by many, with politicians who are in favour or oppose it often being labelled as [[racism|racist]].

The article is primarily seen as a continuation of previous laws made by the [[United Kingdom|British]] to protect the indigenous peoples from being overwhelmed by the immigration of [[Chinese Malaysian|Chinese]] and [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian]] workers into [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]]. In the years after independence in 1957, the Chinese and Indians were generally rich urban dwellers, whilst the Bumiputra were mostly poor farmers or manual labourers.

The first clause of the article provides that the government should act "in accordance with the provisions of this Article".

==Origins==
The Constitution was drafted on the basis of a report from the [[Reid Commission]]. The commission, which had been formed to lay the groundwork for a Constitution in the run-up to Malaysia's pending independence, released the report in 1957 as the Report of the Federation of Malaya Constitutional Commission 1957 or The Reid Commission Report.&lt;ref&gt;Adam, Ramlah binti, Samuri, Abdul Hakim bin &amp; Fadzil, Muslimin bin (2004). ''Sejarah Tingkatan 3''. Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka. {{ISBN|983-62-8285-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the report, the Reid Commission stated that "''provision should be made in the Constitution for the 'safeguarding of the special position of the Malays and the legitimate interests of the other Communities'.''" However, the Commission "''found it difficult [...] to reconcile the terms of reference if the protection of the special position of the Malays signified the granting of special privileges, permanently, to one community only and not to the others.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_of_the_Federation_of_Malaya_Constitutional_Commission,_1957|title=Report of the Federation of Malaya Constitutional Commission, 1957|last=Commission|first=Federation of Malaya Constitutional}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- page not found error &lt;ref name="utusan_context"&gt;Ooi, Jeff (2005). [http://www.jeffooi.com/archives/2005/08/the_nst_should.php "Social Contract: 'Utusan got the context wrong'"]. Retrieved 11 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

The Reid Commission reported that [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] and the Malay Rulers had asked that "''in an independent Malaya all nationals should be accorded equal rights, privileges and opportunities and there must not be discrimination on grounds of race and creed.''" At that time, Tunku Abdul Rahman was the leader of the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), which led the ''[[Barisan Nasional|Alliance]]'' [[coalition]]. Eventually the Alliance would become the Barisan Nasional and Tunku Abdul Rahman later became the first [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]]. When succeeding to the UMNO Presidency, Tunku had expressed doubts about the loyalty of the non-Malays to Malaya, and as a result, insisted that this be settled before they be granted citizenship. However, he also stated that "''For those who love and feel they owe undivided loyalty to this country, we will welcome them as Malayans. They must truly be Malayans, and they will have the same rights and privileges as the Malays.''"&lt;ref&gt;Putra, Tunku Abdul Rahman (1986). ''Political Awakening'', p. 31. Pelanduk Publications. {{ISBN|967-978-136-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission found the existing privileges accorded to the Malays included the allocation of extensive Malay land reservations. In addition, the Commission discovered quotas for admission to the public services with a general rule that "''not more than one-quarter of new entrants [to a particular service] should be non-Malays.''" Operation quotas existed in regard to the issuing of permits or licences for the operation of certain businesses "''chiefly concerned with road haulage and passenger vehicles for hire.''" In addition, there existed "[[scholarship]]s, bursaries and other forms of aid for educational purpose" where preference was given to Malays.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}&lt;!-- page not found error &lt;ref name="utusan_context"/&gt;--&gt;

Although the Commission reported it did not find opposition to the continuance of the existing privileges for a certain length of time, it stated that "''there was great opposition in some quarters to any increase of the present preferences and to their being continued for any prolonged period.''" The Commission recommended that the existing privileges should be continued as the "''Malays would be at a serious and unfair disadvantage compared with other communities if they were suddenly withdrawn.''" However, "''in due course the present preferences should be reduced and should ultimately cease.''" The Commission suggested that these provisions be revisited in 15 years, and that a report should be presented to the appropriate legislature (currently the [[Parliament of Malaysia]]) and that the "legislature should then determine either to retain or to reduce any quota or to discontinue it entirely."{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}&lt;!-- page not found error &lt;ref name="utusan_context"/&gt;--&gt;

Originally there was no reference made to other indigenous peoples of Malaysia (then Malaya) such as the [[Orang Asli]], but with the union of Malaya with [[Singapore]], [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in 1963, the Constitution was amended so as to provide similar privileges for the indigenous peoples of East Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak), grouping them with the Malays as [[Bumiputra]].

The [[20-point agreement]], or the 20-point memorandum, is a list of 20 points drawn up by North Borneo, proposing terms for its incorporation into the new federation as the State of Sabah, during negotiations prior to the formation of Malaysia. In the Malaysia Bill of the Malaysia Agreement some of the twenty points were incorporated, to varying degrees, into what became the Constitution of Malaysia; others were merely accepted orally, thus not gaining legal status. [[Point 12: Special position of indigenous races]] In principle the indigenous races of North Borneo should enjoy special rights analogous to those enjoyed by Malays in Malaya, but the present Malaya formula in this regard is not necessarily applicable in North Borneo.

The scope of Article 153 is limited by Article 136, which requires that civil servants be treated impartially regardless of race.

==Controversy==
Although the Bumiputra have always been the largest racial segment of the Malaysian population (about 65%), their economic position has also tended to be precarious. As late as 1970, 13 years after the drafting of the constitution, they controlled only 4% of the economy, with much of the rest being held by Chinese and foreign interests. As a result, the Reid Commission had recommended the drafting of Article 153 to address this economic imbalance.

But there continued to exist substantial political opposition to the economic reforms designed to aid the Malays. Some{{who|date=February 2012}} contended that Article 153 appeared to unduly privilege the Bumiputra as a higher class of Malaysian citizenry. Many Chinese and Indians also felt unfairly treated since some of them had been there for generations - since the mid-19th century - and yet until the late 1950s, they still had not been awarded Malaysian citizenship. However, a majority of the Malays {{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} during that time believed that the Chinese and the Indians came to [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] for economic purposes only, working at plantations and mines.

In the 1970s, substantial economic reforms ([[Malaysian New Economic Policy]]) were enacted to address the economic imbalance. In the 1980s and 1990s, more affirmative action was also implemented to create a Malay class of entrepreneurs. Public opposition to such policies appeared to wither away after the rioting of May 1969, with parties running on a platform of reducing Bumiputra privileges losing ground in [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliamentary]] elections. However, in the first decade of the 21st century, debate was revived when several government politicians made controversial statements on the nature of Malay privileges as set out by Article 153.

===Early debate===
The article has been a source of controversy since the early days of Malaysia. In particular, it was not entirely clear if Article 153 was predicated on the Malays' economic status at the time, or if it was meant to recognise Bumiputra as a special class of citizens. Some took the latter view, like Singaporean [[politician]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] of the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP), who publicly questioned the need for Article 153 in Parliament, and called for a "[[Malaysian Malaysia]]". In a speech, Lee bemoaned what would later be described as the Malaysian social contract:

''"According to history, Malays began to migrate to Malaysia in noticeable numbers only about 700 years ago. Of the 39% Malays in Malaysia today, about one-third are comparatively new immigrants like the secretary-general of UMNO, Dato' [[Syed Ja'afar Albar]], who came to Malaya from [[Indonesia]] just before the war at the age of more than thirty. Therefore it is wrong and illogical for a particular racial group to think that they are more justified to be called Malaysians and that the others can become Malaysian only through their favour."''&lt;ref&gt;Ye, Lin-Sheng (2003). ''The Chinese Dilemma'', p. 143. East West Publishing. {{ISBN|0-9751646-1-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee also criticised the government's policies by stating that ''"[t]hey, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved."''&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Kuan Yew (2000). ''The Singapore Story'' (abridged edition), pp. 327–328. Federal Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; He also lamented ''"Malaysia—to whom does it belong? To Malaysians. But who are Malaysians? I hope I am, Mr Speaker, Sir. But sometimes, sitting in this chamber, I doubt whether I am allowed to be a Malaysian."''{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}&lt;!-- page not found error &lt;ref name="sitting_duck"&gt;Ooi, Jeff (2005). [http://www.jeffooi.com/archives/2005/11/i_went_into_act.php "Perils of the sitting duck"]. Retrieved 11 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Lee's statements upset many, especially politicians from the Alliance. Then Finance Minister [[Tan Siew Sin]] called Lee the ''"greatest, disruptive force in the entire history of Malaysia and Malaya."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/merger/headline/mimposib.html "'Impossible to co-operate with Singapore while Lee is Premier'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310003615/http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/merger/headline/mimposib.html |date=10 March 2005 }}. (2 June 1965). ''[[Straits Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tunku considered Lee to be too extremist in his views, while other UMNO politicians thought Lee was simply taking advantage of the situation to pander to the [[Chinese Malaysian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Khaw, Ambrose (1998).[http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/merger/lifeline/akimpos.html "This man is making too much noise"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522214050/http://ourstory.asia1.com.sg/merger/lifeline/akimpos.html |date=22 May 2006 }}. Retrieved 11 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[PAP-UMNO relations]] were chilled further when UMNO officials publicly backed the opposition [[Singapore Alliance Party]] in [[Singapore general election, 1963|Singapore's 1963 general election]] and PAP responded in turn by fielding several candidates in the Malaysian federal elections in 1964. These acts were seen by each party as challenges of the other's authority in their respective domains, and in violation of previous agreements made by the PAP and UMNO before merger not to contest each other's elections until Malaysia had matured enough.&lt;ref&gt;Goh, Cheng Teik (1994). ''Malaysia: Beyond Communal Politics'', pp. 36–37. Pelanduk Publications. {{ISBN|967-978-475-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The tension led to the [[1964 Race Riots|1964 racial riots]] in Singapore that killed 36 people. Eventually, the Tunku decided to ask Singapore, through Lee and some of his closest confidantes, to secede from Malaysia.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Eventually, Lee (reluctantly) agreed to do so, {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} and Singapore became an independent nation in 1965, with Lee as its first [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}&lt;!-- page not found error &lt;ref name="sitting_duck"/&gt;--&gt; The [[Constitution of Singapore]] contains an article, Article 152, that names the Malays as "indigenous people" of Singapore and therefore requiring special safeguarding of their rights and privileges as such. However, the article specifies no policies for such safeguarding.

===Racial rioting===
On 13 May 1969, a few days after the 10 May general election, a [[May 13 Incident|race riot]] broke out. In the preceding election, parties like the [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP, formerly the Malaysian branch of the PAP) and [[Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia]], which opposed special Bumiputra privileges, had made substantial gains, coming close to defeating the Alliance and forming a new government. The largely Chinese opposition Democratic Action Party and Gerakan later secured a police permit for a victory parade through a fixed route in [[Kuala Lumpur]], the capital city of Malaysia. However, the rowdy procession deviated from its route and headed through the Malay district of [[Kampung Baru, Kuala Lumpur|Kampung Baru]], jeering at the inhabitants. While the Gerakan party issued an apology the next day, UMNO announced a counter-procession starting from the head of Selangor state Dato' Harun bin Idris on Jalan Raja Muda. Reportedly, the gathering crowd was informed that Malays on their way to the procession had been attacked by Chinese in Setapak, several miles to the north. The angry protestors swiftly wreaked revenge by killing two passing Chinese motorcyclists, and the riot began. The official death toll was approximately 200, although some would later estimate it to be as high as 2000. The riot was later attributed to the underlying discontent among Malays due to poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Means, Gordon P. (1991). ''Malaysian Politics: The Second Generation'', p. 7, Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-588988-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

UMNO Parliamentary backbencher [[Mahathir Mohamad]] soon became the face of a movement against the Tunku, arguing that he had been too accommodative towards the non-Malays. In a letter to the Prime Minister, demanding his resignation, Mahathir argued that the Tunku had given the Chinese "too much face" and that the responsibility for the deaths of the people in the riot rested squarely on the Tunku's shoulders. Mahathir was expelled from UMNO not long after, and Home Affairs Minister [[Ismail Abdul Rahman]] warned that ''"[t]hese [[ultra (Malaysia)|ultras]] believe in the wild and fantastic theory of absolute dominion by one race over the other communities, regardless of the Constitution"''.&lt;ref&gt;Means, pages 9, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government suspended Parliament and the executive branch governed on its own through the National Operations Council (NOC) until 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Goh p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ye p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; The NOC proposed amendments to the [[Sedition Act (Malaysia)|Sedition Act]] that made illegal the questioning of, among others, Article 153. These amendments were passed by Parliament as law when it reconvened in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Means, pages 14, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of NOC governance, the [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] (NEP) was implemented. The NEP aimed to eradicate poverty irrespective of race by expanding the economic pie so that the Chinese share of the economy would not be reduced in absolute terms but only relatively. The aim was for the Malays to have a 30% equity share of the economy, as opposed to the 4% they held in 1970. Foreigners and Chinese held much of the rest.&lt;ref&gt;Ye p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The NEP appeared to be derived from Article 153 and could be viewed as being in line with its wording. Although Article 153 would have been up for review in 1972, fifteen years after Malaysia's independence in 1957, due to the [[May 13 Incident]] it remained unreviewed. A new expiration date of 1991 for the NEP was set, twenty years after its implementation.&lt;ref name="ye_pg95"&gt;Ye p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional affirmative action===
[[File:Bumi discount mod.jpg|frame|Under the terms of the affirmative action policies implemented in line with Article 153, Bumiputra are given discounts on real estate.]]

Mahathir, who had been a strong supporter of affirmative action for the Malays since the late 1960s, expounded upon his views in his book ''[[The Malay Dilemma]]'' while in political exile. The book argued that stronger measures were needed to improve the Malays' economic lot.&lt;ref&gt;Ye p. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; It also contended that the Malays were the "definitive" people and thus "rightful owners" of Malaysia, which also entitled them to their privileges but he also criticized the Malays for being "easily forgetful".&lt;ref&gt;Musa, M. Bakri (1999). ''The Malay Dilemma Revisited'', p. 3. Merantau Publishers. {{ISBN|1-58348-367-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mahathir was rehabilitated under the second Prime Minister, Tun Abdul Razak, and was appointed as the Deputy of the third Prime Minister, Tun [[Hussein Onn]]. When Hussein Onn resigned, Mahathir became Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;Means, pp. 23, 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

During Mahathir's tenure as Prime Minister, the NEP, after its expiry, was replaced by the [[National Development Policy]] (NDP), that sought to create a Malay class of entrepreneurs and business tycoons.&lt;ref name="ye_pg95"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ye p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; However, allegations of [[Political corruption|corruption]] and [[nepotism]] plagued Mahathir's administration, and Mahathir's goal of creating a new class of Malay [[tycoon]]s was criticised for ignoring the rural Malays, who comprised the majority of the Malay population.&lt;ref&gt;Ye p. 23, 174, 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Mahathir, quotas for entry into public [[university|universities]] were enforced, with some universities such as [[Universiti Teknologi MARA]] (UiTM) admitting only [[Bumiputra]] students.&lt;ref&gt;Musa p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quek"&gt;Quek, Kim (4 December 2004). [http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2004/12/unveiling-truth-of-malay-special.htm "Unveiling the truth of Malay 'Special Rights'"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123201833/http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2004/12/unveiling-truth-of-malay-special.htm |date=23 November 2005 }}. ''[[Malaysia Today]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, then Education Minister [[Najib Tun Razak]] (son of Tun Abdul Razak who implemented the NEP) stated that without quotas, only 5% of undergraduates in public universities would be Malays. Najib argued this justified the need for the continuance of quotas.&lt;ref&gt;Musa p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

These policies also mandate that publicly listed companies must set aside 30% of equity for Bumiputras; discounts that must be provided for automobile and real estate purchases; a set amount of lots set aside for Bumiputras in housing projects; companies submitting bids for government projects be Bumiputra-owned and that Approved Permits (APs) for importing automobiles be preferentially given to Bumiputras.&lt;ref&gt;Shari, Michael (29 July 2002).

===Meritocracy===
In 2003, Mahathir began stressing that Malays needed to abandon their "crutches," and implemented a policy of "[[meritocracy]]". However, this policy by and large streams Bumiputras into what is termed [[matriculation]], as a prelude to university admission, whereby students take a course and later sit for a test set by the instructor. The non-Bumiputras generally sit for the [[Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Malaysia]] (STPM) standardised examination to enter university. Although it is possible for non-Bumiputras to enter matriculation, and Bumiputras who prefer to take the STPM may do so, in practice, it is difficult for non-Bumiputras to gain entry into the matriculation stream.&lt;ref&gt;Yeoh, Oon (4 June 2004). [http://www.sun2surf.com/articlePrint.cfm?id=3441 "Meritocracy: The truth must be well told"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050316064532/http://www.sun2surf.com/articlePrint.cfm?id=3441 |date=16 March 2005 }}. ''The Sun''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The meritocracy policy itself came in for criticism from both sides of the political divide, with some quarters of UMNO calling it "discrimination," leading to an "uneven playing field," and asked for the restoration of the quota system that set the ratio of Bumiputra to non-Bumiputra students in public institutions at 55 to 45.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/printable.php?id=144240 "Johor Umno Says Meritocracy A Form Of Discrimination"]. (9 July 2005). ''BERNAMA''.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, branded meritocracy as a sham due to its division of students into the two different streams.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Guan Eng (2004). [http://dapmalaysia.org/english/lge/lge011.htm "Will qualified non-bumi students be sacrificed by Shafie for his defeat in UMNO?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050907000000/http://dapmalaysia.org/english/lge/lge011.htm |date=7 September 2005 }}. Retrieved 11 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Mahathir was succeeded by [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]], who, like his predecessor, warned the Malays that over-reliance on their privileges would be fatal. "A continuing reliance on crutches will further enfeeble [the nation], and we may eventually end up in wheelchairs."&lt;ref&gt;Badawi, Abdullah Ahmad (2004). [http://www.pmo.gov.my/WebNotesApp/PMMain.nsf/0/c3a7ebf8a2bd8cfd48256f180033b236?OpenDocument "Moving Forward — Towards Excellence"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912000000/http://www.pmo.gov.my/WebNotesApp/PMMain.nsf/0/c3a7ebf8a2bd8cfd48256f180033b236?OpenDocument |date=12 September 2007 }}. Retrieved 11 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, within UMNO, some, such as Education Minister [[Hishamuddin bin Hussein]] - Hussein Onn's son, and UMNO Deputy Permanent Chairman [[Badruddin Amiruldin]], appeared to disagree and in turn argued for the protection of Malay privileges.

In 2005, several Malays, led by Hishamuddin at the UMNO Annual General Meeting (AGM) argued that the 30% equity target of the NEP had yet to be met and called on the government to restore the NEP as the [[New National Agenda]] (NNA).&lt;ref&gt;Ooi, Jeff (2005). [http://www.jeffooi.com/archives/2005/07/the_30_solution.php "The 30% solution"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051030210515/http://www.jeffooi.com/archives/2005/07/the_30_solution.php |date=30 October 2005 }}. Retrieved 12 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; At the past year's AGM, Badruddin had warned questioning Article 153 and "Malay rights" would be akin to stirring up a [[hornet]]'s nest, and declared, "Let no one from the other races ever question the rights of Malays on this land." The year before, UMNO Youth Information Chief [[Azmi Daim]] had also said, "In Malaysia, everybody knows that Malays are the masters of this land. We rule this country as provided for in the federal constitution. Any one who touches upon Malay affairs or criticizes Malays is [offending] our sensitivities."&lt;ref&gt;Gatsiounis, Ioannis (2 October 2004). [http://atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/FJ02Ae05.html "Abdullah stirs a hornets' nest"]. ''Asia Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2005 AGM, Hishamuddin brandished the traditional Malay [[dagger]], the ''[[kris]]'', while warning the non-Bumiputras not to attack Malay rights and "[[ketuanan Melayu]]" (translated variously as Malay supremacy or dominance).&lt;ref&gt;Jalleh, Martin (9 January 2005). [http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2005/01/umno-maturity-or-mutation.htm "UMNO: Maturity or mutation?"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124051308/http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2005/01/umno-maturity-or-mutation.htm |date=24 November 2005 }}. ''[[Malaysia Today]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; His action was applauded by the UMNO delegates. Then Higher Education Minister [[Shafie Salleh]] also stated that he would ensure the amount of new Malay students admitted would always exceed the old quotas set, and that UiTM would remain an all-Bumiputra institution.&lt;ref name="quek"/&gt;

===Present opposition===
[[File:Anwar Ibrahim speaking.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Anwar Ibrahim]] has been critical of the [[Malaysian New Economic Policy|New Economic Policy]] since his recent release from prison.]]

At present, the Bumiputra privileges both enshrined in Article 153 and as set out by other acts of law, remain in force. Many opposition parties including, the DAP and [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat]] (PKR), have pledged themselves to undoing the NEP. The DAP has argued that it does not have anything against the special position of Bumiputras as set out in Article 153, but seeks to undo the government's policies such as the NEP that they believe discriminate unfairly against the non-Bumiputras.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Ronnie Tian Khiew (10 December 2004).

''Malaysia Today''.&lt;/ref&gt; The PKR, which was founded to fight for the release of former Deputy Prime Minister [[Anwar Ibrahim]], who had been detained for charges of corruption and [[sodomy]] after he publicly opposed Mahathir's policies, also has criticised the NEP. After Anwar's release in 2004, he criticised the NEP as having failed the Malays and stated that he would seek its replacement by a more equitable policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/42419 "Anwar: Time to suspend NEP"].

The NEP and other privileges accorded to the Bumiputras or Malays under Article 153 have been noted for not explicitly seeking to eradicate poverty among the Malays, but instead largely aiming to improve the Malays' overall share of the economy, even if this share is held by a small number of Malays.&lt;ref&gt;Bennet, Abang (2005). [http://www.aliran.com/monthly/2005b/7d.html "UMNO: A threat to national prosperity"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104011120/http://www.aliran.com/monthly/2005b/7d.html |date=4 January 2006 }}. Retrieved 11 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the NEP has also been defended as having been largely successful in creating a Malay [[middle class]] and improving Malaysian [[standard of living|standards of living]] without compromising the non-Bumiputra share of the economy in absolute terms; indeed, statistics indicate that the Chinese and Indian middle classes also grew under the NEP, albeit not as much as the Malays'. It has also been contended that the NEP defused racial tensions by eradicating the perception of the Chinese as the mercantile class and the perception of the Malays as mere farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Ye pp. 85, 92, 94, 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 10 (4) of the Constitution permits Parliament to make it illegal to question, among others, Article 153 of the Constitution. Under the Sedition Act, questioning Article 153 is indeed illegal—even for Members of Parliament, who usually have the freedom to discuss anything without fear of external censure.&lt;ref name="Means, pp. 14, 15"/&gt; The government can also arbitrarily detain anyone it desires theoretically for sixty days, but in reality for an undetermined length of time, under the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] (ISA). In 1987 under [[Operation Lalang]] (literally "weeding operation"), several leaders of the DAP, including [[Lim Kit Siang]] and [[Karpal Singh]], were held under the ISA. It is widely believed this was due to their calling for the NEP and other Malay privileges to be reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Kit Siang (2005).

''Malaysia Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the issue of the Constitution and its provisions was also brought up by several politicians within the government itself. [[Lim Keng Yaik]] of the [[Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia|Gerakan]] party, which by now had joined [[Barisan Nasional]], the ruling coalition, asked for a re-examination of the [[social contract (Malaysia)|social contract]] so that a [[Bangsa Malaysia]] (literally 'Malaysian race' or 'Malaysian nation' in the [[Malay language]]) could be achieved.&lt;ref name="new_controversy"&gt;Ooi, Jeff (2005).

Retrieved 12 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The social contract is the Constitution's provisions with regard to the different races' privileges—those who defend it and Article 153 often define the social contract as providing the Indians and Chinese with citizenship in exchange for the Malays' special rights or ''ketuanan Melayu''.

Lim was severely criticised by many Malay politicians, including [[Khairy Jamaluddin]], the Prime Minister's son-in-law and Deputy Chairman of the UMNO Youth wing, and [[Ahmad Shabery Cheek]], a prominent Malay Member of Parliament from the state of [[Terengganu]]. The Malay press, most of which is owned by UMNO, also ran articles condemning the questioning of the social contract.&lt;ref&gt;Yusoff, Marzuki &amp; Samah, Nazeri Nong (14 August 2005). [http://www.utusan.com.my/utusan/content.asp?y=2005&amp;dt=0815&amp;pub=Utusan_Malaysia&amp;sec=Muka_Hadapan&amp;pg=mh_03.htm "Kontrak sosial: Kenyataan Keng Yaik bercanggah Perlembagaan Persekutuan"]. ''Utusan Malaysia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Lim was adamant, asking in an interview ''"How do you expect non-Malays to pour their hearts and souls into the country, and to one day die for it if you keep harping on this? Flag-waving and singing the '[[Negaraku]]' ''(the national anthem)'' are rituals, while true love for the nation lies in the heart."''&lt;ref name="new_controversy"/&gt;

A year earlier, Abdullah had given a speech where he mentioned the most "significant aspect" of the social contract as "the agreement by the indigenous peoples to grant citizenship to the immigrant Chinese and Indians". Although Abdullah went on to state that the character of the nation changed to "one that Chinese and Indian citizens could also call their own,"&lt;ref&gt;Badawi, Abdullah Ahmad (2004). [http://domino.kln.gov.my/kln/statemen.nsf/0/eee39330c19514e648256e7c0009f6ee?OpenDocument "The Challenges of Multireligious, Multiethnic and Multicultural Societies"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225000000/http://domino.kln.gov.my/kln/statemen.nsf/0/eee39330c19514e648256e7c0009f6ee?OpenDocument |date=25 February 2006 }}. Retrieved 12 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; the speech went largely unremarked.

In the end, Lim stated that the Malay press had blown his comments out of proportion and misquoted him. The issue ended with UMNO Youth chief Hishamuddin Hussein warning people not to "bring up the issue again as it has been agreed upon, appreciated, understood and endorsed by the Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news.php?id=150404 "Don't Raise Social Contract Issue, Umno Youth Chief Warns"].

==Notes and references==
{{note|reference_name_A|}}Terms used in Article 153 to categorise people (‘Malays’, ‘natives’) are defined in [[Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia|Articles 160]] ([[:s:Constitution of Malaysia#Article 160|English]] · [http://wikisource.org/wiki/Perlembagaan_Persekutuan_Malaysia/Am_dan_Pelbagai Malay]) and 161a ([[:s:Constitution of Malaysia#Article 161a|English]] · [http://wikisource.org/wiki/Perlembagaan_Persekutuan_Malaysia/Perlindungan_Tambahan_bagi_Negeri_Sabah_dan_Sarawak Malay]).  Perhaps unintuitively, only “a person who professes the religion of Islam” may be a ‘Malay’ (''orang Melayu'') in the sense of the constitution (for other contexts, see the article at [[Malays (ethnic group)]]).  This restriction, if not those about “conform[ing] to Malay custom” and “habitually speak[ing] the Malay language”,  would seem to affect many [[Orang Asli]], a group defined in Article 160 but not mentioned in Article 153.  The term ''bumiputera'' is neither used nor defined in the constitution.

Originally, Marx used the expression to criticise the vision of [[Sergey Nechayev]], outlined in the ''Fundamentals of the Future Social System''.&lt;ref&gt;Главные основы будущего общественного строя, According to Marx, printed in the second issue of 'Народная расправа' magazine available in [[Geneva]] in December 1869, but labelled "St.Petersburg, winter 1870".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt; Although, significantly, he did not deny that it was a valid form of communism.

The term ''[[barracks]]'' here does not refer to [[military barracks]], but to the workers' barracks-type primitive dormitories in which industrial workers lived in many places in the [[Russian Empire]] of the time.&lt;ref name=bm&gt;Alexander Busgalin, Günter Mayer, "[http://www.inkrit.de/e_inkritpedia/e_maincode/doku.php?id=k:kasernenkommunismus Kasernenkommunismus]" in: ''Historisch-kritisches Wörterbuch des Marxismus'', vol. 7/I, 2008, Spalten, 407–411 ([http://guentermayer.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/kasernenkommunismus-hkwm-7-i1.pdf pdf text])&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, political theorists of the [[Soviet Union]] applied this term to the [[People's Republic of China]] under [[Mao Zedong]] (1950s–1970s).&lt;ref name=bse/&gt; Still later during the Soviet [[Perestroika]] period, the term was used to apply to the history of the Soviet Union itself.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;. In general the term with its original meaning can be applied to any form of communism, although communists themselves use it to stigmatise rival visions of communism, and as a scapegoat to the failings of their own.

== Primary sources ==
A relevant section of [[Sergey Nechayev]]'s "The Fundamentals of the Future Social System" reads as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;The ending of the existing social order and the renewal of life with the aid of the new principles can be accomplished only by concentrating all the means of social existence in the hands of our committee, and the proclamation of compulsory physical labour for everyone.

The committee, as soon as the present institutions have been overthrown, proclaims that everything is common property, orders the setting up of workers' societies” (''[[artel]]s'') and at the same time publishes statistical tables compiled by experts and pointing out what branches of labour are most needed in a certain locality and what branches may run into difficulties there.

For a certain number of days assigned for the revolutionary upheaval and the disorders that are bound to follow, each person must join one or another of these artels according to his own choice... All those who remain isolated and unattached to workers' groups without sufficient reason will have no right of access either to the communal eating places or to the communal dormitories, or to any other buildings assigned to meet the various needs of the brother-workers or that contain the goods and materials, the victuals or tools reserved for all members of the established workers' society; in a word, he who without sufficient reason has not joined an artel, will be left without means of subsistence. All the roads, all the means of communication will be closed to him; he will have no other alternative but work or death.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In their [[International Alliance of Socialist Democracy]] and the [[International Workingmen's Association]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] quote the above text and comment as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;What a beautiful model of barracks communism! Here you have it all: communal eating, communal sleeping, assessors and offices regulating education, production, consumption, in a word, all social activity, and to crown all, Our Committee, anonymous and unknown to anyone, as the supreme dictator. This indeed is the purest anti-authoritarianism...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some commentators have noted the necessity of bureaucracies in modern society. The German sociologist [[Max Weber]] argued that bureaucracy constitutes the most efficient and rational way in which one can organize the human activity and that systematic processes and organized hierarchies are necessary to maintain order, maximize [[efficiency]], and eliminate favoritism. On the other hand, Weber also saw unfettered bureaucracy as a threat to [[individual freedom]], with the potential of trapping individuals in an impersonal "[[iron cage]]" of rule-based, rational control.&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GRitzer"/&gt;

==Etymology and usage==
The term "bureaucracy" is French in origin and combines the French word ''bureau'' – desk or office – with the Greek word κράτος (''Kratos'') – rule or political power.&lt;ref name= "merriam-webster1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bureaucracy |title= Bureaucracy | type = definition | work = Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was coined in the mid-18th century by the French economist [[Jacques Claude Marie Vincent de Gournay]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Riggs | first = Fred W | url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0003/000366/036645fo.pdf | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] |trans-title=Introduction: semantic evolution of the ‘bureaucracy’ term | language = fr | title = Introduction : Évolution sémantique du terme 'bureaucratie' | journal = Revue internationale des sciences sociales | publisher = Unesco | place = Paris | volume = XXX I | year = 1979 | number = 4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a satirical pejorative from the outset.&lt;ref&gt;Anter, Andreas. [http://trivium.revues.org/3794 L'histoire de l'État comme histoire de la bureaucratie]. ''Trivium'', 7; 6 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Gournay never wrote the term down but was later quoted at length in a letter from a contemporary:
{{quotation |The late M. de Gournay... sometimes used to say: "We have an illness in France which bids fair to play havoc with us; this illness is called bureaumania." Sometimes he used to invent a fourth or fifth form of government under the heading of "bureaucracy."|[[Baron von Grimm]]&lt;ref name= "Handbook"/&gt;}}

The first known English-language use dates to 1818.&lt;ref name= "merriam-webster1"/&gt; Here, too, the sense was pejorative, with Irish novelist [[Sydney, Lady Morgan|Lady Morgan]] referring to "the Bureaucratie, or office tyranny, by which Ireland has so long been governed."&lt;ref name = "lady morgan"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nCc1AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35|title=Florence Macarthy|first= Sydney|last=Lady Morgan|accessdate= 2014-11-18|page=35|year=1818}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century, the word was being used in a more neutral sense, referring to a system of public administration in which offices were held by unelected career officials. In this sense "bureaucracy" was seen as a distinct form of management, often subservient to a monarchy.&lt;ref name= "google1"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KtFI15WCr_8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA3 |title=Bureaucracy|first=David|last= Beetham|publisher= Google |accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the definition was expanded by the German sociologist [[Max Weber]] to include any system of administration conducted by trained professionals according to fixed rules.&lt;ref name= "google1"/&gt; Weber saw the bureaucracy as a relatively positive development; however, by 1944 the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises noted that the term bureaucracy was "always applied with an opprobrious connotation,"&lt;ref name= "Mises" /&gt; and by 1957 the American sociologist Robert Merton noted that the term "[[bureaucrat]]" had become an [[epithet]].&lt;ref name= "Merton" /&gt;

==History==

===Ancient===
[[File:Civilserviceexam1.jpg|thumb|Students competed in [[imperial examination]]s to receive a position in the bureaucracy of [[ancient China]].]]
Although the term "bureaucracy" was not coined until the mid 18th century, organized and consistent administrative systems are much older. The development of writing (ca. 3500 BC) and the use of documents was critical to the administration of this system, and the first definitive emergence of bureaucracy is in ancient [[Sumer]], where an emergent class of [[scribe]]s used [[clay tablet]]s to administer the harvest and allocate its spoils.&lt;ref name="Scribes"&gt;{{cite book|title=Civilizations of the Ancient Near East|editor=Jack M. Sasson|year=1995|publisher=Macmillan Library Reference|chapter=The Scribes and Scholars of Ancient Mesopotamia|author=Laurie E. Pearce|pages=2265–2278|url=https://www.academia.edu/562267/The_scribes_and_scholars_of_ancient_Mesopotamia|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Egypt]] also had a hereditary class of scribes that administered the [[civil service]] bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="Scribal training"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Scribal Training in Ancient Egypt|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=92|number=2|year=1972|author=Ronald J. Williams|jstor=600648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Empire]] was administered by a hierarchy of regional proconsuls and their deputies. The reforms of [[Diocletian]] doubled the number of administrative districts and led to a large-scale expansion of Roman bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;As taken from the ''[[Laterculus Veronensis]]'' or ''Verona List'', reproduced in Barnes, ''New Empire'', chs. 12–13 (with corrections in T.D. Barnes, "Emperors, panegyrics, prefects, provinces and palaces (284–317)", ''Journal of Roman Archaeology'' 9 (1996): pp. 539–42). See also: Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 9; Cascio, "The New State of Diocletian and Constantine" (CAH), 179; Rees, ''Diocletian and the Tetrarchy'', pp. 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The early Christian author [[Lactantius]] claimed that Diocletian's reforms led to widespread economic stagnation, since "the provinces were divided into minute portions, and many presidents and a multitude of inferior officers lay heavy on each territory."&lt;ref name="Lactantius"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lactantius|author-link=Lactantius|title=On the Manner in which the Persecutors Died|chapter=Chapter 7|url=http://people.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/lactant/lactpers.html#VII}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Empire split, the [[Byzantine Empire]] developed a notoriously [[Byzantine bureaucracy|complicated administrative hierarchy]], and in time the term "Byzantine" came to refer to any complex bureaucratic structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/byzantine|title=Byzantine – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-webster.com|date=2012-08-31|accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient China]], the [[Han dynasty]] established a complicated bureaucracy based on the teachings of [[Confucius]], who emphasized the importance of [[Li (Confucian)|ritual]] in a family, relationships, and politics.&lt;ref name="Confucius"&gt;{{cite book|author=Riegel, Jeffrey|chapter=Confucius|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|edition=Spring 2012|editor=Edward N. Zalta|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2012/entries/confucius}}&lt;/ref&gt; With each subsequent Dynasty, the bureaucracy evolved. During the [[Song dynasty]], the bureaucracy became [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]]. Following the [[Song dynasty|Song]] reforms, [[imperial examination|competitive exams]] were held to determine who was qualified to hold a given position.&lt;ref name="McKnight1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=McKnight|first=Brian E.|title=Village and Bureaucracy in Southern Sung China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEr8_6LieVMC&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=7 February 2013|date=1983-02-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-56060-1|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The imperial examination system lasted until 1905, six years before the collapse of the [[Qing dynasty]], marking the end of China's traditional bureaucratic system.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Modern===
====The United Kingdom====
[[File:London customs house 18th century.jpg|thumb|The 18th century [[HM Customs and Excise|Department of Excise]] developed a sophisticated bureaucracy. Pictured, the [[Custom House, London]].]]
A modern form of bureaucracy evolved in the expanding [[HM Customs and Excise|Department of Excise]] in the United Kingdom during the 18th century.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}{{original research inline|date=June 2016}} The relative efficiency and professionalism in this state-run authority allowed the government to impose a very large [[tax burden]] on the population and raise great sums of money for [[military budget|war expenditure]]. According to [[Niall Ferguson]], the bureaucracy was based on "recruitment by examination, training, promotion on merit, regular salaries and pensions, and standardized procedures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xNwfbPVMb_wC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Cash Nexus: Money and Politics in Modern History, 1700-2000|author=Niall Ferguson|year=2013|publisher=Penguin UK|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was subject to a strict hierarchy and emphasis was placed on technical and efficient methods for tax collection.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Instead of the inefficient and often corrupt system of [[tax farming]] that prevailed in [[absolute monarchy|absolutist]] states such as France, the [[Exchequer]] was able to exert control over the entire system of tax revenue and government expenditure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/workingPapers/2012/WP167.pdf|title=3 Public finance in China and Britain in the long eighteenth century|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 18th century, the ratio of fiscal bureaucracy to population in Britain was approximately 1 in 1300, almost four times larger than the second most heavily bureaucratized nation, France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPxlQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Linda+Weiss%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Kc8gUqOwGKay7AbL7IFA&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwAw|title=States and Economic Development: A Comparative Historical Analysis|author1=Linda Weiss |author2=John Hobson |year=1995|publisher=Wiley|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain's consul in [[Guangzhou]], argued in his ''Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China'' (1847) that "the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only," and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution [[meritocratic]].&lt;ref name="Bodde"/&gt; Influenced by the ancient Chinese [[imperial examination]], the [[Northcote–Trevelyan Report]] of 1854 recommended that recruitment should be on the basis of merit determined through competitive examination, candidates should have a solid general education to enable inter-departmental transfers, and promotion should be through achievement rather than "preferment, patronage, or purchase".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilservant.org.uk/northcotetrevelyan.pdf Full text of the Northcote-Trevelyan Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222072511/http://www.civilservant.org.uk/northcotetrevelyan.pdf |date=22 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bodde"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bodde|first=Derke|title=China: A Teaching Workbook|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/song/readings/inventions_ideas.htm|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to implementation of [[Her Majesty's Civil Service]] as a systematic, meritocratic civil service bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=David|title=Fair game|publisher=The Guardian|date=2003-07-09|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/jul/09/publicsector.guardiansocietysupplement|accessdate =2003-07-09|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
Like the British, the development of French bureaucracy was influenced by the Chinese system. Under [[Louis XIV of France]], the old nobility had neither power nor political influence, their only privilege being exemption from taxes. The dissatisfied noblemen complained about this "unnatural" state of affairs, and discovered similarities between [[absolute monarchy]] and bureaucratic [[despotism]].&lt;ref name="Jacoby1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Jacoby|title=The Bureaucratization of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zGwVaki8uXIC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate=September 16, 2013|date=January 1, 1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02083-2|page=40-43}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the translation of [[Confucian]] texts during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the concept of a [[meritocracy]] reached intellectuals in the West, who saw it as an alternative to the traditional ''[[ancien regime]]'' of Europe.&lt;ref name="EE"&gt;Schwarz (1996), p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Western perception of China even in the 18th century admired the Chinese bureaucratic system as favourable over European governments for its seeming meritocracy; [[Voltaire]] claimed that the Chinese had "perfected moral science" and [[François Quesnay]] advocated an economic and political system modeled after that of the Chinese.&lt;ref name="EE1"&gt;Schwarz (1996), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;
The governments of China, Egypt, Peru and Empress [[Catherine II]] were regarded as models of Enlightened Despotism, admired by such figures as Diderot, D'Alembert and Voltaire.&lt;ref name="Jacoby1973"/&gt;

Napoleonic France adopted this meritocracy system &lt;ref name="EE"/&gt; and soon saw a rapid and dramatic expansion of government, accompanied by the rise of the French civil service and its complex systems of bureaucracy. This phenomenon became known as "bureaumania". In the early 19th century, [[Napoleon]] attempted to reform the bureaucracies of France and other territories under his control by the imposition of the standardized [[Napoleonic Code]]. But paradoxically, that led to even further growth of the bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3iSkH1Qf6xsC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142|title=Handbook of Administrative History - Paper - J.C.N. Raadschelders|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other industrialized nations====
By the mid-19th century, bureaucratic forms of administration were firmly in place across the industrialized world. Thinkers like [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Karl Marx]] began to theorize about the economic functions and power-structures of bureaucracy in contemporary life. [[Max Weber]] was the first to endorse bureaucracy as a necessary feature of modernity, and by the late 19th century bureaucratic forms had begun their spread from government to other large-scale institutions.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

The trend toward increased bureaucratization continued in the 20th century, with the public sector employing over 5% of the workforce in many Western countries.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Within capitalist systems, informal bureaucratic structures began to appear in the form of corporate power hierarchies, as detailed in mid-century works like ''[[The Organization Man]]'' and ''[[The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit]]''. Meanwhile, in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Bloc]] nations, a powerful class of bureaucratic administrators termed ''[[nomenklatura]]'' governed nearly all aspects of public life.&lt;ref name="Voslensky"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Michael Voslensky|author-link=Michael Voslensky|year=1984|title=Nomenklatura: The Soviet Ruling Class|publisher=Doubleday|edition=1st|isbn=0-385-17657-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980s brought a backlash against perceptions of "big government" and the associated bureaucracy. Politicians like [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] gained power by promising to eliminate government regulatory bureaucracies, which they saw as overbearing, and return economic production to a more purely capitalistic mode, which they saw as more efficient.&lt;ref name="ThatcherBBC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Viewpoints: How did Margaret Thatcher change Britain?|website=BBC News|date=13 April 2013|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-22076774}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Speech"&gt;{{cite speech|title=A Time For Choosing|author=Ronald Reagan|date=27 October 1964|url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/reference/timechoosing.html|website=Ronald Reagan Presidential Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the business world, managers like [[Jack Welch]] gained fortune and renown by eliminating bureaucratic structures inside corporations.&lt;ref name="Welch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/1996/44/b34991.htm |title=Jack Welch's Encore |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=14 June 1997 |accessdate=2010-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101031942/http://www.businessweek.com/1996/44/b34991.htm |archivedate=1 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, in the modern world, most organized institutions rely on bureaucratic systems to manage information, process records, and administer complex systems, although the decline of paperwork and the widespread use of electronic databases is transforming the way bureaucracies function.&lt;ref name="Modernity"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199563654.do|title=Managing Modernity: Beyond Bureaucracy?|editor1=Stewart R.

==Theories==

===Karl Marx===
[[Karl Marx]] theorized about the role and function of bureaucracy in his ''[[Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right]]'', published in 1843. In ''[[Philosophy of Right]]'', [[Hegel]] had supported the role of specialized officials in [[public administration]], although he never used the term "bureaucracy" himself. Marx, by contrast, was opposed to bureaucracy. Marx posited that while [[corporation|corporate]] and government bureaucracy seem to operate in opposition, in actuality they mutually rely on one another to exist. He wrote that "The Corporation is civil society's attempt to become state; but the bureaucracy is the state which has really made itself into civil society."&lt;ref name="Marx1843"/&gt;

===John Stuart Mill===
Writing in the early 1860s, political scientist [[John Stuart Mill]] theorized that successful monarchies were essentially bureaucracies, and found evidence of their existence in [[Imperial China]], the [[Russian Empire]], and the regimes of [[Europe]]. Mill referred to bureaucracy as a distinct form of government, separate from representative democracy. He believed bureaucracies had certain advantages, most importantly the accumulation of experience in those who actually conduct the affairs. Nevertheless, he believed this form of governance compared poorly to representative government, as it relied on appointment rather than direct election. Mill wrote that ultimately the bureaucracy stifles the mind, and that "a bureaucracy always tends to become a pedantocracy."&lt;ref name="Mill"/&gt;

===Max Weber===&lt;!--'Weberian bureaucracy' redirects here--&gt;
{{Quote box

|Bureaucratic administration means fundamentally domination through knowledge|–'''Max Weber'''&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt;}}
The German sociologist [[Max Weber]] was the first to formally study bureaucracy and his works led to the popularization of this term.&lt;ref name="BuSach"/&gt; In his 1922 essay ''Bureaucracy'',[https://www.academia.edu/31803869/_Bureaucracy_by_Max_Weber_Translated_and_Edited_by_Tony_Waters_and_Dagmar_Waters],&lt;ref&gt;Weber, 2015, pp. 73–127 in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, New York: Palgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt; published in his magnum opus ''[[Economy and Society]]'', Weber described many [[ideal type|ideal-typical]] forms of [[public administration]], government, and business. His ideal-typical bureaucracy, whether public or private, is characterized by:
* hierarchical organization
* formal lines of authority ([[command hierarchy|chain of command]])
* a fixed area of activity
* rigid division of labor
* regular and continuous execution of assigned tasks
* all decisions and powers specified and restricted by regulations
* officials with expert training in their fields
* career advancement dependent on technical qualifications
* qualifications evaluated by organizational rules, not individuals&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weber 2015, p. 76, in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society: New Translations on Politics, Bureaucracy, and Social Stratification, edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters. New York: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber listed several preconditions for the [[emergence]] of bureaucracy, including an increase in the amount of space and population being administered, an increase in the complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out, and the existence of a [[monetary economy]] requiring a more efficient administrative system.&lt;ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176"/&gt; Development of [[information and communications technology|communication]] and [[transportation]] technologies make more efficient administration possible, and [[democratization]] and rationalization of culture results in demands for [[equal treatment]].&lt;ref name="AllanAllan2005-172-176"/&gt;

Although he was not necessarily an admirer of bureaucracy, Weber saw bureaucratization as the most efficient and rational way of organizing human activity and therefore as the key to [[rational-legal authority]], indispensable to the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_c3Mcnh8hCgC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Max Weber (2015) extract], books.google.ca; accessed 30 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] of [[Western society]].&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2009-38-42"/&gt; Weber also saw bureaucracy, however, as a threat to individual freedoms, and the ongoing bureaucratization as leading to a "polar night of icy darkness", in which increasing rationalization of human life traps individuals in a soulless "[[iron cage]]" of bureaucratic, rule-based, rational control.&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GRitzer"/&gt; Weber's critical study of the bureaucratization of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work.&lt;ref name="Bureaucratic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2009-38-42"/&gt; Many aspects of modern public administration are based on his work, and a classic, hierarchically organized [[civil service]] of the Continental type is called "Weberian civil service".&lt;ref name="Hooghe2001"/&gt;

===Woodrow Wilson===
Writing as an academic while a professor at [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s essay "[[The Study of Administration]]"&lt;ref&gt;Woodrow Wilson, "The Study of Administration", ''Political Science Quarterly'', July 1887&lt;/ref&gt; argued for bureaucracy as a professional cadre, devoid of allegiance to fleeting politics. Wilson advocated a bureaucracy that "is a part of political life only as the methods of the counting house are a part of the life of society; only as machinery is part of the manufactured product. But it is, at the same time, raised very far above the dull level of mere technical detail by the fact that through its greater principles it is directly connected with the lasting maxims of political wisdom, the permanent truths of political progress."

Wilson did not advocate a replacement of rule by the governed, he simply advised that, "Administrative questions are not political questions. Although politics sets the tasks for administration, it should not be suffered to manipulate its offices". This essay became a foundation for the study of public administration in America.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Ludwig von Mises===
In his 1944 work ''[[Bureaucracy (book)|Bureaucracy]]'', the Austrian economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] compared bureaucratic management to profit management. Profit management, he argued, is the most effective method of organization when the services rendered may be checked by economic calculation of profit and loss. When, however, the service in question can not be subjected to economic calculation, bureaucratic management is necessary. He did not oppose universally bureaucratic management; on the contrary, he argued that bureaucracy is an indispensable method for social organization, for it is the only method by which the law can be made supreme, and is the protector of the individual against despotic arbitrariness. Using the example of the Catholic Church, he pointed out that bureaucracy is only appropriate for an organization whose code of conduct is not subject to change. He then went on to argue that complaints about bureaucratization usually refer not to the criticism of the bureaucratic methods themselves, but to "the intrusion of bureaucracy into all spheres of human life." Mises saw bureaucratic processes at work in both the private and public spheres; however, he believed that bureaucratization in the private sphere could only occur as a consequence of government interference. According to him, "What must be realized is only that the strait jacket &lt;!--[sic]--&gt; of bureaucratic organization paralyzes the individual's initiative, while within the capitalist market society an innovator still has a chance to succeed. The former makes for stagnation and preservation of inveterate methods, the latter makes for progress and improvement."&lt;ref name="Mises"/&gt;

===Robert K. Merton===
American sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] expanded on Weber's theories of bureaucracy in his work ''Social Theory and Social Structure'', published in 1957. While Merton agreed with certain aspects of Weber's analysis, he also noted the dysfunctional aspects of bureaucracy, which he attributed to a "trained incapacity" resulting from "over conformity". He believed that bureaucrats are more likely to defend their own entrenched interests than to act to benefit the organization as a whole but that pride in their craft makes them resistant to changes in established routines. Merton stated that bureaucrats emphasize formality over interpersonal relationships, and have been trained to ignore the special circumstances of particular cases, causing them to come across as "arrogant" and "haughty".&lt;ref name="Merton"/&gt;

=== Elliott Jaques ===
In his book “A General Theory of Bureaucracy”, first published in 1976, [[Elliott Jaques|Dr. Elliott Jaques]] describes the discovery of a universal and uniform underlying structure of managerial or work levels in the bureaucratic hierarchy for any type of employment systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55877281|title=Constructing the infrastructure for the knowledge economy : methods and tools, theory and structure|last=|first=|date=2004|publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers|others=Linger, Henry,|year=|isbn=0306485540|location=New York|pages=104|oclc=55877281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elliott Jaques]] argues and presents evidence that for the bureaucracy to provide a valuable contribution to the open society some of the following conditions must be met:
* Number of levels in a bureaucracy hierarchy must match the complexity level of the employment system for which the bureaucratic hierarchy is created (Elliott Jaques identified maximum 8 levels of complexity for bureaucratic hierarchies).
* Roles within a bureaucratic hierarchy differ in the level of work complexity.
* The level of work complexity in the roles must be matched with the level of human capability of the role holders (Elliott Jaques identified maximum 8 Levels of human capability).
* The level of work complexity in any managerial role within a bureaucratic hierarchy must be one level higher than the level of work complexity of the subordinate roles.
* Any managerial role in a bureaucratic hierarchy must have full managerial accountabilities and authorities (veto selection to the team, decide task types and specific task assignments, decide personal effectiveness and recognition, decide initiation of removal from the team within due process).
* Lateral working accountabilities and authorities must be defined for all the roles in the hierarchy (7 types of lateral working accountabilities and authorities: collateral, advisory, service-getting and -giving, coordinative, monitoring, auditing, prescribing).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2089721|title=A general theory of bureaucracy|last=Elliott.|first=Jaques,|date=1976|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=0435824783|location=London|oclc=2089721}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychoanalysis-and-therapy.com/human_nature/free-associations/kirsnerjaques.html|title=Psychoanalysis Psychotherapy|website=www.psychoanalysis-and-therapy.com|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1990/01/in-praise-of-hierarchy|title=In Praise of Hierarchy|date=1990-01-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The definition of effective bureaucratic hierarchy by [[Elliott Jaques]] is of importance not only to sociology but to social psychology, social anthropology, economics, politics, and social philosophy. They also have a practical application in business and administrative studies.

'''Colin Beavan''' (born 1963&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3090200018/beavan-colin-1963.html Encyclopedia.com article]&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[United States|American]] non-fiction writer and internet [[blog]]ger noted for recording the attempts of his family to live a "zero impact" lifestyle in [[New York City]] for one year.

==Zero Impact Experiment==
The rules of the experiment included producing no trash save for [[compost]], purchasing no goods except for food grown within a 250-mile radius, using no [[carbon]]-based transportation, and using no paper products, including [[toilet paper]]. He and his family are the subject of a documentary, ''[[No Impact Man|No Impact Man: The Documentary]]''.  A book about the year-long experiment was released in September 2009.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/22/garden/22impact.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5070&amp;en=37d113fa8f818cee&amp;ex=1188100800 |publisher=The New York Times |title=The Year Without Toilet Paper |author=Penelope Green |date=2007-03-22 |accessdate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/TenWays/Story?id=3159955&amp;page=1 |title=No Impact Man: Extreme Green Living |date=2007-06-25 |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcnews"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7000991.stm |title=US family tries life without toilet paper |date=2007-09-19 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing career==
Beavan was named one of [[MSN|MSN’s]] Ten Most Influential Men of 2007 and was named an Eco-Illuminator in ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle Magazine's]]'' 2008 Green Awards. His blog NoImpactMan.com was named one of the world’s top 15 environmental
websites by ''[[Time Magazine]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}}  He has written for numerous American magazines, including the ''Atlantic Monthly'' and ''Wired''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pritzkermilitary.org/whats_on/pritzker-military-presents/colin-beavan-operation-jedburgh/ |title=Colin Beavan: Operation Jedburgh &amp;#124; Pritzker Military Museum &amp; Library &amp;#124; Chicago |publisher=Pritzkermilitary.org |date=2006-06-01 |accessdate=2014-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
In May 2012, Beavan announced he would run for the [[United States House of Representatives]] seat representing [[New York's 8th congressional district]], running as the nominee of the [[Green Party of New York|Green Party]]. Beavan lost the general election to [[Hakeem Jeffries]], a member of the New York State Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Elizabeth (May 14, 2012).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5962">The organisation of a '''Conference of Specialised Ministers''' is a traditional working method of the [[Council of Europe]].  

The purpose of such [[Diplomatic conference|conferences]] is to define and pursue the goals of the Council of Europe’s  intergovernmental activities in their particular fields of competence. These conferences have a quasi-legal identity of their own in [[international relations]].
The practice began in [[Vienna]] in 1959 with the first Conference of Ministers responsible for Family Affairs. However, the working methods for such conferences were only formalised in 1971 with the adoption of Committee of Ministers Resolution (71) 44.,&lt;ref&gt;https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=653281&lt;/ref&gt; which gives a list of conferences with which the Council of Europe "has a special working relationship".  

In February 2008, in the interests of transparency and visibility, the Committee of Ministers decided that all of its ministerial conferences would henceforth include "Council of Europe" in the title.&lt;ref&gt;https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=CM/Del/Dec(2008)1018/1.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Several attempts to update this text finally came to fruition in June 2011 with the adoption of Resolution CM/Res(2011)7.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title= Resolution CM/Res(2011)7 on Council of Europe conferences of specialised ministers
|publisher=Council of Europe
|date=2011-06-16
|url= https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1803499&amp;Site=CM&amp;BackColorInternet=C3C3C3&amp;BackColorIntranet=EDB021&amp;BackColorLogged=F5D383
|accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of the Conferences are prepared by a special committee of senior officials, which meets solely for that purpose. Others are prepared by the respective Council of Europe steering committee.
The Committee of Ministers issues a regular information document "Forthcoming Conferences of Specialised Ministers", which gives the current state of preparation of these conferences.&lt;ref&gt;https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1326901&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conferences traditionally use a 3-letter abbreviation by which they and their relevant reports and resolutions are readily identified. Although a few of these have changed over the years, most of them have remained remarkably consistent.

The Committee of Ministers currently lists 14 conferences as operational:

*Council of Europe Conference of Ministers responsible for [[human migration|Migration]] Affairs (MMG)
*Council of Europe Conference of Ministers responsible for Integration Policies for People with [[disabilities]] (IPH)
*Council of Europe Conference of [[Health]] Ministers (MSN)
*Council of Europe [[Conference of Ministers of Justice]] (MJU)
*Council of Europe Conference of Ministers responsible for Spatial/[[Regional Planning]] (CEMAT)
*Council of Europe Conference of Ministers responsible for [[Cultural]] Affairs (CMC)
*Council of Europe Standing Conference of Ministers of [[Education]] (MED)
*Council of Europe Conference of Ministers responsible for [[Sport]] (MSL)
*Council of Europe Conference of Ministers responsible for [[Local Government|Local]] and [[Regional government|Regional]] Government (MCL)
*Council of Europe Ministerial Conference on the [[Mass media|Media]] and New Communication Services (MCM)
*Council of Europe Conference of Ministers responsible for [[Youth]] (MJN)
*Council of Europe Conference of Ministers responsible for [[Family]] Affairs (MMF)
*Council of Europe Ministerial Conference on [[Gender equality|Equality]] between Women and Men (MEG)
*Council of Europe Conference of Ministers responsible for [[Social cohesion|Social Cohesion]]

The last of these, the Conference on Social Cohesion, is new, and met for the first time in [[Moscow]] in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1290559&lt;/ref&gt;
There have been a number of other conferences in the past, which are now discontinued.  Many of the conferences have undergone several name changes, which make them difficult to trace.
They should be distinguished from [[European Union]] ministerial conferences. The European Union occasionally convenes ministers in certain sectors (such as culture).&lt;ref&gt;http://paper.standartnews.com/en/article.php?d=2008-07-24&amp;article=24603&lt;/ref&gt; Such meetings are often described as informal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euractiv.com/en/security/ministers-disagree-european-criminal-record/article-134831&lt;/ref&gt;  

Some of the more successful conferences (e.g. Ministers of Justice) have become virtual institutions in themselves.
The Committee of Ministers approves the theme and the organisations and non-member states to be invited.

Each conference makes a report to the Committee of Ministers after the conference, which also examines the possible follow-up to the conference.
Several conferences of specialised ministers have only been held once, with no plans for them to meet again, notably :  

*[[Human rights]] (1985)
*[[Research]] (1986)
*[[Terrorism]] (1986)
*[[Displaced persons|Movement of persons]] (1991)

Four other ministerial conferences have been discontinued :

*Ministers of [[Cultural heritage]] (MPC), which last met in 1985 (2nd conference ), 1992 (3rd conference), 1996 (4th conference) and 2001 (5th conference)
*[[Environment minister|Ministers of Environment]] (MEN),  which last met in   1987 (5th conference) and 1990 (6th conference)
*Ministers of [[Labour (economics)|Labour]] (MTV), which last met in    1986 (3rd conference), 1989 (4th conference) and 1993 (5th conference)
*Ministers of [[Social security]] (MSS), which last met in   1989 (4th conference), 1992 (5th conference), 1995 (6th conference), 1998 (7th conference) and 2002 (8th conference)

The '''Cortes Gerais'''  ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''General Courts''; [[Reforms of Portuguese orthography|pre-1911]]: '''Cortes Geraes'''&lt;ref&gt;https://repository.library.brown.edu/studio/item/bdr:574055/PDF/&lt;/ref&gt;) were the legislature of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] during the [[History of Portugal (1834–1910)|Constitutional Monarchy period]].&lt;ref name="AR - Monarquia Constitucional"&gt;{{cite |date= |title= A Monarquia Constitucional (1820-1910) |trans-title= |language= Portuguese |author = [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]] |location= Lisbon |url= https://www.parlamento.pt/Parlamento/Paginas/AMonarquiaConstitucional5.aspx#1838}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cortes were established by provision of the 1822 Portuguese Constitution as a [[unicameral]] parliament.&lt;ref name="AR - Monarquia Constitucional"/&gt; However, the [[Constitutional Charter of 1826]] reformed the Cortes as a [[bicameral]] legislature, with the [[Chamber of Most Worthy Peers|Chamber of Most Worthy Peers of the Kingdom]] as its [[upper house]] and the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Portuguese Nation|Chamber of Gentlemen Deputies of the Portuguese Nation]] as its [[lower house]].&lt;ref name="AR - Monarquia Constitucional"/&gt;

The name of the legislature originates from the traditional [[Portuguese Cortes]], the [[parliament]] convening the [[three estates]] during the absolute monarchy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7906">'''Denationalized Citizenship''' is one of many new [[citizenship]] processes which redefine traditional notions of citizenship as intrinsically linked with the [[nation-state]] and occurs within a subnational scale. A denationalized citizen does not consider the nation-state as being necessary for political [[participation (decision making)|participation]] and [[identity (social science)|identity]].

==Overview==
The concept of citizenship has historically been associated with [[national identity]] and the nation-state since the [[French Revolution]] saw the people claim [[sovereignty]] of the state and essentially become the state.&lt;ref&gt;Kadioglu, Ayse. Denationalization of Citizenship? The Turkish Experience. Citizenship Studies. 2007.11 (3), p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; The growing importance of global processes has led to practices which were previously uniquely bound with the nation-state moving to other private, [[supranational]] and [[subnational]] institutions and spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Sassen, Saskia. The Need to Distinguish Denationalized and Postnational. Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies. 2000. 7 (2), pp. 579&lt;/ref&gt; Denationalized citizenship is a concept which has emerged due to complex processes associated with [[globalization]] and the consequent changes of the role of the nation-state due to [[privatization]], [[deregulation]] and increased [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Sassen, Saskia. Towards Post-National Citizenship.In: Isin, E. and Turner, B. (eds.) Handbook of Citizenship Studies. 2002. p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; These globalization processes occurring most notably since the 1980s have created new and strengthened pre-existing divisions within nation-states.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James. The Exaggerated Death of the Nation-State. In: Anderson, J., Brook, C., Cochrane, A. (eds.). A Global World: Re-ordering Political Space. 1995. p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Put simply, denationalized citizenship is when communities have a stronger sense of belonging and identification with smaller cultural and social groups than with their nation-state.&lt;ref&gt;Sassen, Saskia. Towards Post-National Citizenship.In: Isin, E. and Turner, B. (eds.) Handbook of Citizenship Studies. 2002. p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some see the [[United States]] as a nation of [[nationalities]] more than a nation-state.&lt;ref name="KarstKenneth"&gt;Karst, Kenneth. Citizenship, Law and the American Nation. Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies. 2000. 7 (2), p. 595&lt;/ref&gt; Denationalized citizenship suggests that citizenship can be practiced at a variety of scales and leads to a new understanding of the relationship between citizenship and the nation-state. Denationalized citizenship is not, however, entirely disconnected from the nation-state but indicates a new way of interacting with it and within it.&lt;ref name="KadiogluAyse"&gt;Kadioglu, Ayse. Denationalization of Citizenship? The Turkish Experience. Citizenship Studies. 2007. 11 (3), pp. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social aspects==
Denationalized citizenship and an increase in [[self-determination]] can create new political spaces and arenas of participation. Denationalized citizenship may empower groups such as women who could establish a public presence and make claims on the state.&lt;ref&gt;Schylter, Ann. Body Politics and the Crafting of Citizenship in Peri-urban Lusaka. Feminist Africa 13 Gendered Body Politics and Crafting Citizenship. 2009. p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore denationalized citizenship exists partly due to the actions of the excluded.&lt;ref&gt;Sassen, Saskia. Towards Post-National Citizenship.In: Isin, E. and Turner, B. (eds.) Handbook of Citizenship Studies. 2002. p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; Increased [[civil rights]] facilitate the denationalization of citizenship as citizens can make claims against their nation-states and act autonomously in the political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Sassen, S. The Need to Distinguish Denationalized and Postnational. Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies. 2000. 7 (2), pp. 575-584&lt;/ref&gt; Denationalized citizenship reflects the evolving and progressing capacity of [[democracy]] and the [[democratization]] of citizenship is therefore linked to denationalization and the changing authority of nation-states.&lt;ref&gt;Kadioglu, Ayse. Denationalization of Citizenship? The Turkish Experience. Citizenship Studies. 2007. 11 (3), pp. 283&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of right which denationalizes citizenship is the portable rights within the [[European Union]], for example, where there is a change in recognition from citizens of a nation-state to individuals as individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Sassen, Saskia. Limits of Power and the Complexity of Powerlessness. Unbound. 2007. Vol 3: 105. p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Denationalized citizenship calls for a new understanding of citizenship as a concept which encompasses many, at times overlapping, communities and feelings of belonging and identification.&lt;ref name="CammaertsBart"&gt;Cammaerts, Bart. Citizenship, the Public Sphere and Media. In: Cammaerts, B and Carpentier, N (eds.) Reclaiming the Media: Communication rights and expanding democratic media roles. 2006. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates==

Denationalized citizenship emerges from the premise that nation-states are no longer solely capable of enhancing political participation and can in fact create an obstacle for such activity. Additionally, identity is no longer synonymous with the nation-state&lt;ref&gt;Kadioglu, Ayse. Denationalization of Citizenship? The Turkish Experience. Citizenship Studies. 2007. 11 (3), pp. 284&lt;/ref&gt; and citizenship is increasingly understood as "a form of identification, a type of political identity, something to be constructed, not empirically given" (Mouffe, 1992: 231). These points appear to challenge the sovereignty and authority of the nation-state as the traditional frame of reference for identity and political participation&lt;ref name="CammaertsBart" /&gt; which imply a pressure to fragment territorial structures.

===Criticisms===
The idea that denationalized citizenship poses a serious problem for the nation-state is contested. Practices of national citizenship may be in decline due to the many processes transforming citizenship&lt;ref name="KarstKenneth" /&gt; however some believe that these challenges do not completely undermine the state but rather signify a simultaneous reconfiguring of citizenship and the nation-state's functions. Denationalized citizenship can coexist with the nation-state but is necessary to widen the possibilities of political participation in the globalizing world.

==Denationalized citizenship vs. Postnational and Transnational citizenship==
Denationalized citizenship, postnational and transnational citizenship are frequently misused and used interchangeably, therefore a distinction between the terms is important. Denationalized citizenship is often used to mean any type of contemporary concept of citizenship which separates itself from the nation-state, however it alone means processes occurring within the borders of the nation-state. Postnational and transnational citizenship refer to new types of citizenship, such as [[citizenship of the European Union]], which are outside of national [[borders]]&lt;ref name="KadiogluAyse" /&gt; and, although all concepts share some characteristics, denationalized citizenship does not require that citizenship be relocated to outside of the nation-state, as is central to postnational and transnational citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Sassen, Saskia. Towards Post-National Citizenship.In: Isin, E. and Turner, B. (eds.) Handbook of Citizenship Studies. 2002. p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; Although denationalized citizenship can be associated with or caused by global and transnational processes, it occurs within the [[nation]]al and not outside of or across several nation-states.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2550">'''Diplomatic service''' is the body of [[diplomat]]s and [[foreign policy]] officers maintained by the [[government]] of a [[country]] to communicate with the governments of other countries. Diplomatic personnel enjoy [[diplomatic immunity]] when they are accredited to other countries. Diplomatic services are often part of the larger [[civil service]] and sometimes a constituent part of the [[foreign ministry]].

Some intergovernmental organizations, such as the [[European Union]], and some international non-state organizations, such as the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], may also retain diplomatic services in other jurisdictions. For non-state organizations, the reciprocation of diplomatic recognition by other jurisdictions is difficult, as diplomacy tends to establish the concept of recognition upon an assumed sovereignty over geographical territory; the SMOM, in this case, receives diplomats at its headquarters in Rome, as all permanent missions to the SMOM are jointly accredited as permanent missions to the Holy See. In relation, many more non-state international organizations, such as the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|IFRC]]/[[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]], maintain permanent [[Observer status|non-voting observer status]] to intergovernmental bodies such as the [[United Nations General Assembly]], appointing individual representatives to the observer office.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44913">'''E-services''' (electronic services) are services which use of [[Information and communication technology|information and communication technologies]] (ICTs). The three main components of e-services are- service provider, service receiver and the channels of service delivery (i.e., technology). For example, as concerned to public e-service, public agencies are the service provider and citizens as well as businesses are the service receiver. The channel of service delivery is the third requirement of e-service. Internet is the main channel of e-service delivery while other classic channels (e.g. telephone, call center, public kiosk, mobile phone, television) are also considered.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Rowley, J. (2006) An analysis of the e-service literature: towards a research agenda. Internet Research, 16 (3), 339-359&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception in the late 1980s in Europe{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} and formal introduction in 1993 by the US Government,&lt;ref&gt;Alasem, A. (2009). An Overview of e-Government Metadata Standards and Initiatives based on Dublin Core. Electronic Journal of e-Government, 7(1), 1 – 10&lt;/ref&gt; the term ‘[[E-Government]]’ has now become one of the recognized research domains especially in the context of public policy and now has been rapidly gaining strategic importance in public sector modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Wimmer, M., Codagnone, C. and Janssen, M. (2008) “Future of e-Government Research: 13 research themes identified in the eGovRTD2020 project’. Proceedings of the 41st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, USA&lt;/ref&gt; E-service is one of the branches of this domain and its attention has also been creeping up among the practitioners and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Lӧfstedt, U. (2005) ‘Assessment of current research and some proposals for future direction’, International Journal of Public IS&lt;/ref&gt;

E-service (or eservice) is a highly generic term, usually referring to ‘The provision of services via the Internet (the prefix 'e' standing for ‘electronic’, as it does in many other usages), thus e-Service may also include e-Commerce, although it may also include non-commercial services (online), which is usually provided by the government.’ (Irma Buntantan &amp; G. David Garson, 2004: 169-170; Muhammad Rais &amp; Nazariah, 2003: 59, 70-71).

"E-Service constitutes the online services available on the Internet, whereby a valid transaction of buying and selling (procurement) is possible, as opposed to the traditional websites, whereby only descriptive information are available, and no online transaction is made possible." (Jeong, 2007).&lt;ref&gt;Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim. (2007). ''Fundamental of Development Administration.'' Selangor: Scholar Press. {{ISBN|978-967-5-04508-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance of E-service ==
Lu (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Lu, J. (2001). Measuring cost/benefits of e-business applications and customer satisfaction”, Proceedings of the 2nd International Web Conference, 29–30 November, Perth, Australia, 139-47&lt;/ref&gt; identifies a number of benefits for e-services, some of these are:

* Accessing a greater customer base
* Broadening market reach
* Lowering of entry barrier to new markets and cost of acquiring new customers
* Alternative communication channel to customers
* Increasing services to customers
* Enhancing perceived company image
* Gaining competitive advantages
* Enhancing transparency 
* Potential for increasing [[Customer knowledge]]

==Importance and advantages of E-shopping==
*E-shops are open 24 hours a day.
*There is no need to travel to the malls or wait at the checkout counters.
*There is usually a wide selection of goods and services.
*It is easy to compare prices and quality by using the E-shopping tool.
*Price reduction and discounts are electronically conveyed.

==E-service domain==
The term ‘e-service’ has many applications and can be found in many disciplines. The two dominant application areas of e-services are

E-business (or e-commerce): e-services mostly provided by businesses or [NGO|non-government organizations] (NGOs) (private sector).

E-government: e-services provided by government to citizens or business (public sector is the supply side). The use and description of the e-service in this page will be limited to the context of e-government only where of the e-service is usually associated with prefix “public”: Public e-services. In some cases, we will have to describe aspects that are related to both fields like some conferences or journals which cover the concept of “e-Service” in both domains of e-government and [[e-business]].[example:[https://web.archive.org/web/20180125141728/http://eserviceforyou.com/] www.eserviceforyou.com]

==Architecture==
Depending on the types of services, there are certain functionalities required in the certain layers of e-service architectural framework, these include but are not limited to – Data layer (data sources), processing layers (customer service systems, management systems, data warehouse systems, integrated customer content systems), exchange layer ([[Enterprise application integration|Enterprise Application Integration]]– EAI), interaction layer ( integrating e-services), and presentation layer (customer interface through which the web pages and e-services are linked).

==E-service quality==
Measuring [[service quality]] and service excellence are important in a competitive organizational environment. The [[SERVQUAL]]- service quality model is one of the widely used tools for measuring quality of the service on various aspects. The five attributes of this model are: reliability, responsiveness, assurance, tangibles, and empathy. The following table summarizes some major of these:

The [[LIRNEasia]] study on benchmarking national telecom regulator websites focuses on content than on accessibility and ease of use, unlike the other studies mentioned here. Websites are increasingly important portals to government agencies, especially in the context of [[information society]] reforms. Stakeholders, including businesses, investors and even the general public, are interested in information produced by these agencies, and websites can help to increase their transparency and accountability. The quality of its website also demonstrates how advanced a regulatory agency is.

==E-service cost factor==
Some major cost factors are (Lu, 2001):&lt;ref&gt;Lu, J. (2001). Measuring cost/benefits of e-business applications and customer
satisfaction”, Proceedings of the 2nd International Web Conference, 29–30 November, Perth, Australia, 139-47&lt;/ref&gt;

* Maintaining applications
* Internet connection
* Hardware/software
* Security concerns
* legal issues
* Training; and
* Rapid technology changes

==Practical examples of e-services in the Developing World==
Information technology is a powerful tool for accelerating economic development. Developing countries have focused on the development of ICT during the last two decades and as a result, it has been recognized that ICT is critical to economy and is as a catalyst of economic development. So, in recent years there seems to have been efforts for providing various e-services in many developing countries since ICT is believed to offer considerable potential for the sustainable development of e-Government and as a result, e-Services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Ndou, V.(2004)E-Government for developing countries: Opportunities and Challenges, EJISDC 18, 1, 1-24&lt;/ref&gt;

Many government agencies in developed countries have taken progressive steps toward the web and ICT use, adding coherence to all local activities on the Internet, widening local access and skills, opening up interactive services for local debates, and increasing the participation of citizens on promotion and management of the territory(Graham and Aurigi, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Graham, S. and Aurigi, A. (1997) Virtual Cities, Social Polarisation, and the Crisis in Urban Public Space, Journal of Urban Technology, 4, 1, 19-52&lt;/ref&gt;

But the potential for e-government in developing countries remains largely unexploited, even though. ICT is believed to offer considerable potential for the sustainable development of e-government. Different human, organizational and technological factors,
issues and problems pertain in these countries, requiring focused studies and appropriate approaches. ICT, in general, is referred to as an “enabler”, but on the other hand, it should also be regarded as a challenge and a peril in itself. The organizations, public or private, which ignore the potential value and use of ICT may suffer pivotal competitive disadvantages. Nevertheless, some e-government initiatives have flourished in developing countries too, e.g. Brazil, India, Chile, etc.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; What the experience in these countries shows, is that governments in the developing world can effectively exploit and appropriate the benefits of ICT, but e-government success entails the accommodation of certain unique conditions, needs and obstacles. The adaptive challenges of e-government go far beyond technology, they call for organizational structures and skills, new forms of leadership, transformation of public-private partnerships (Allen et al., 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Allen, A.B., Juillet, L., Paquet, G. and Roy, J. (2001) E-Governance and Government Online in Canada: Partnerships, People and Prospects, Government Information Quarterly,18, 93-104.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following are a few examples regarding e-services in some developing countries:

===E-services in Bangladesh===
Bangladesh first e-service system is National E-Service System ([http://www.eservice.gov.bd/[ NESS]]) and 2nd e-Service For you [http://eserviceforyou.com/[eserviceforyou.com]]. 

===E-services in Rwanda===
Only a decade after emerging from the fastest genocide of the 20th Century, Rwanda, a small country in Eastern Central Africa,
has become one of the continent’s leaders in, and model on, bridging the digital divide through e-government. Rwanda has undergone a rapid turnaround from one of the most technologically deficient countries only a decade ago to a country
where legislative business is conducted online and wireless access to the Internet is available anywhere in the country. This is
puzzling when viewed against the limited progress made in other comparable developing countries, especially those located in the
same region, sub-Saharan Africa, where the structural and institutional constraints to e-government diffusion are similar.&lt;ref&gt;Mawangi, W.(2006) The social relations of e-government diffusion in developing countries: the case of Rwanda, Proceedings of the 2006 international conference on Digital government research, May 21–24, 2006, San Diego, California&lt;/ref&gt;

===E-services in South Africa===
In South Africa, there continues to be high expectations of government in respect to improved delivery of service and of closer consultation with citizens. Such expectations are not unique to this country, and in this regard there is a need for governments to recognise that the implementation of e-government systems and e-services affords them the opportunity to enhance service delivery and good governance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;van Brakel, P.A.(2009) Proceedings of the 11th Annual Conference on World Wide Web Applications, Port Elizabeth, 2–4 September&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of e-Government has been widely acclaimed in that it provides new impetus to deliver services quickly and efficiently (Evans &amp; Yen, 2006:208).&lt;ref&gt;Evans, D. &amp; Yen, D. C. 2006. e-Government: evolving relationship of citizens and government, domestic, and international development. Government Information Quarterly, 23(2): 207-235.)&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of these benefits, various arms of the South African government have embarked on a number of e-government programmes for example the [http://www.gov.za/  Batho Pele portal], [[Sars efiling|SARS e-filing]], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100405043644/http://www.enatis.com/  e-Natis system], electronic processing of grant applications from remote sites, and a large number of departmental information websites. Also a number of well publicised e-government ventures such as the latter, analysts and researchers consider the state of e-government in South Africa to be at rudimentary stages. There are various factors
which collectively contribute to such an assessment. Amongst these, key factors relate to a lack of a clear strategy to facilitate uptake and adoption of e-government services as well as evaluation frameworks to assess expectations of citizens who are one of the primary user groups of these services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===E-services in Malaysia===
E-Services is one of the pilot projects under the Electronic Government Flagship within the Multimedia Super Corridor ([http://www.mscmalaysia.my/  MSC]) initiative. With E-Services, one can now conduct transactions with Government agencies, such as the Road Transport Department (RTD) and private utility companies such as Tenaga Nasional Berhad ([http://www.tnb.com.my TNB]) and Telekom Malaysia Berhad ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100529003757/http://www.tm.net.my/  TM]) through various convenient channels such as the eServices kiosks and internet. No more queuing, traffic jams or bureaucratic hassles and one can now conduct transaction at one’s own convenience. Also, Electronic Labour Exchange ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100721234322/http://www.elx.gov.my/  ELX])is one stop-centre for labor market information, as supervised by the Ministry of Human Resource ([https://web.archive.org/web/20100419184753/http://www.mohr.gov.my/ MOHR]), to enable employers and job seekers to communicate on the same platform.

[http://www.esyariah.gov.my/  e-Syariah] is the seventh project under the Electronic Government flagship application of the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC). A case management system that integrates the processes related to management of cases for the Syariah Courts.

== Examples of E-services in Established Countries ==

=== E-services in the United States of America ===
In America, citizens have many options and opportunities to follow and understand government actions through e-government. [[Government 2.0]] (Gov. 2.0) is currently in place to bring the people and governments together to learn new information, increase government transparency, and better means for communicating to one another. Gov. 2.0 offers increased citizen participation through on-line applications such as social media and other apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onlinempa.unc.edu/a-citizens-guide-to-open-government-e-government-and-government-2-0/|title=A Citizen's Guide to Open Government, E-Government, and Government 2.0|last=Harper|first=Logan|date=June 10, 2013|website=|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the internet and websites such as USA.gov, an individual can perform actions such as contacting elected officials, find information about the work force such as retirement plans and labor laws, learn about money and consumer issues such as taxes, loans, and welfare, learn about citizenship and obtaining a visa or passport, and other topics such as health and welfare, education, and environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usa.gov|title=USA.gov|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[E-commerce]] is another growing E-service in the United States for both big and small businesses. E-commerce sales are projected to grow 10 to 12 percent annually. [[Amazon.com]] is the largest on-line marketplace in the country with annual sales of $79 billion. [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] is also a widely popular retailer. They have grown their business by having electronic services. Wal-Mart’s sales for E-commerce in 2015 was roughly $13 billion. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] develops and sells a wide variety of technological goods and services such as cell phones, music players, and computers. Apple’s sales for E-commerce in 2015 was $12 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ceoworld.biz/2016/03/08/americas-top-25-e-commerce-retailers-sales/|title=CEO Insiders: America's Top 25 E-commerce Retailers by Sales|last=Bhushan|first=Dr. Amarendra|date=March 8, 2016|website=CEOWorld Magazine|access-date=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; E-services allows businesses to reach new clientele and offer new services. Companies such as [[eBay]] and [[Etsy]] have achieved great success, with eBay posting a net income in 2016 of nearly $9 billion and Esty claiming roughly $200 million in profits from nearly $2 billion sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/27/how-e-commerce-helps-us-small-businesses-go-global.html|title=How e-commerce helps US small businesses go global|last=Rogers|first=Kate|date=April 27, 2015|website=CNBC|access-date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority or eBay's business is conducted in the United States but it does a great deal of international business including the United Kingdom and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/topics/2181/ebay/|title=eBay - Statistics &amp; Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=Statista|access-date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global reach of Etsy is seen in nearly every country in the world with 31% of gross merchandise sales occurring outside of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://amigobulls.com/articles/etsy-ipo-all-you-need-to-know-about-etsy|title=Etsy IPO: All You Need To Know About Etsy|last=Nagarkar|first=Vikram|date=March 19, 2015|website=Amigobulls|access-date=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== E-services in China ===
China’s recent realization of the continuing growth of internet usage has caused the government to recognize the need to expand their E-government services. Some steps the government wants to take in order to increase their E-government services are to develop more online functions, use government sites to integrate on-line services, have supplementary open data available to citizens to further government transparency, and to combine services from local and country-wide governments for convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/09/15/china_gets_the_egov_love_bug/|title=China Gets the E-Gov Love Bug|last=Sharwood|first=Simon|date=September 15, 2016|website=The Register|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916031541/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/09/15/china_gets_the_egov_love_bug/|archive-date=2016-09-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; China’s plan of action to incorporate the internet into everyday business and grow the economy is known as “[[Internet Plus]].” The government plans to have this plan in full effect by 2025 to be the main driving force for economic and social improvements. Internet Plus will help to grow the job market as the government plans to use local citizens for development, and to generate more areas dedicated to technological growth such as [[Zhongguancun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/business/2015-07/04/content_35980397.htm|title='Internet Plus' action plan unveiled|last=Xinhua|first=|date=July 4, 2015|website=China.org|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the large population, China has the most internet and cell phone users in the world.(consider rewording)  This causes a need for technological growth and a demand for increased E-services. In 2016, Chinese consumers spent more money for on-line goods and services than the United States and United Kingdom combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.axios.com/chinas-consumers-outspending-americans-and-british-online-2398441519.html|title=Chinese E-Commerce Boom — Bigger Than US, UK Combined|last=Vavra|first=Shannon|date=May 8, 2017|website=axios.com|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is(are) a wide variety of reasons as to why E-commerce flourishes in China including easy access to mobile internet, low cost of shipping, and a vast selection of cheap, unbranded products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/macroeconomic-insights/growth-of-china/chinese-consumer/index.html?cid=PS_01_50_07_00_01_15_01&amp;mkwid=uui8CuV3|title=The Rise of China's New Consumer Class|last=|first=|date=|website=Goldman Sachs|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alibaba Group|Alibaba]] is China’s largest on-line marketplace with an annual revenue stream of $16 billion. Its services are globally available in Russia and Brazil through [[AliExpress]]. [[Tencent]] is another internet company with an annual revenue income of $16 billion. Tencent is used mainly for instant messaging but has other applications as well including mobile games and other digital content. By the end of 2015, Tencent’s [[WeChat]] messaging app reached around 700 million users. The biggest competitor for Tencent is Facebook’s [[WhatsApp]]. [[Baidu]] Is the most visited website in the country and it is used as a search engine and has an annual revenue of $10 billion. In March 2016, there were roughly 663 million users. [[Google]] challenges Baidu as the major internet search engines in the world. Huawei is a tech company that produces phones, tablets, and develops the equipment used in fixed-line networks. [[Huawei]] has an annual revenue income of $61 billion. It is currently located throughout 100 countries worldwide and in 2015, it filed 3,898 patent applications, more than any other country in the world. The biggest competitors to Huawei is Apple and [[Samsung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/05/17/technology/china-tech-behemoths/index.html|title=Meet China's Tech Behemoths|last=Mullen|first=Jethro|date=May 17, 2016|website=CNN|access-date=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges to e-services in the Developing World==
The future of e-service is bright but some challenges remain. There are some challenges in e-service, as Sheth &amp; Sharma (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Sheth., J.N., Sharma, A., (2007). E-Services: A framework for growth.  Journal of Value Chain Management, 1(1/2)&lt;/ref&gt; identify, are:

* Low penetration of ICT especially in the developing countries;
* [[Internet fraud|Fraud]] on the internet space which is estimated around 2.8billion USD
* [[Internet privacy|Privacy]] due the emergence of various types of spyware and security holes, and
* intrusive characteristics of the service (e.g. mobile phones based) as customers may not like to be contacted with the service providers at any time and at any place.

The first challenge and primary obstacle to the e-service platform will be penetration of the internet. In some developing countries, the access to the internet is limited and speeds are also limited. In these cases firms and customers will continue to use traditional platforms. The second issue of concern is fraud on the internet. It is anticipated that the fraud on the e-commerce internet space costs $2.8 billion. Possibility of fraud will continue to reduce the utilization of the internet. The third issue is of privacy. Due to both spyware and security holes in operating systems, there is concern that the transactions that consumers undertake have privacy limitations.  For example, by stealthily following online activities, firms can develop fairly accurate descriptions of customer profiles.  Possibility of privacy violations will reduce the utilizations of the internet. The final issue is that e-service can also become intrusive as they reduce time and location barriers of other forms of contract. For example, firms can contact people through mobile devices at any time and at any place. Customers do not take like the intrusive behavior and may not use the e-service platform. (Heiner and lyer, 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Heiner and lyer (2007) E-Service opportunities and Threats, Journal of value chain management, 1, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major e-service keywords==
A considerable amount of research efforts already exists on the subject matter exploring different aspects of e-service and e-service delivery ; one worth noting effort is Rowley’s study (2006)&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; who did a review study on the e-service literature. The key finding of his study is that there is need to explore dimensions of e-service delivery not focusing only on service quality “In order to understand e-service experiences it is necessary to go beyond studies of e-service quality dimensions and to also take into account the inherent characteristics of e-service delivery and the factors that differentiate one service experience from another.”

Some of the major keywords of e-service as found in the e-government research are as follows:

===Acceptance===
User acceptance of technology is defined according to Morris (1996, referred by Wu 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;1)&lt;ref&gt;Wu, Philip F. (2009). User Acceptance of Emergency Alert Technology: A Case Study. Proceedings of the 6th International ISCRAM Conference – Gothenburg, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt; as “the demonstrable willingness within a user group to employ information technology for the tasks it is designed to support”. This definition can be brought into the context of e-service where acceptance can be defined as the users’ willingness to use e-service or the willingness to decide when and how to use the e-service.

===Accessibility===
Users’ ability to access to the e-service is important theme in the previous literature. For example, Huang (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Huang, C.J. (2003). Usability of E-Government Web Sites for People with Disabilities, In Proceedings of the 36th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS’03), IEEE Computer Society, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; finds that most of the websites in general fail to serve users with disabilities. Recommendation to improve accessibility is evident in previous literature including Jaeger (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, P.T. Assessing Section 508 compliance on federal e-government Web sites: A multi-method, user-centered evaluation of accessibility for persons with disabilities. Government Information Quarterly 23 (2006) 169–190&lt;/ref&gt; who suggests the following to improve e-services’ accessibility like: design for accessibility from the outset of website development, Involve users with disabilities in the testing of the site …Focus on the benefits of an accessible Web site to all users.

===Administrative literacy===
According to Grönlund et al. (2007),&lt;ref&gt;Grönlund, Å., Hatakka, M. and Ask, A. (2007) ‘ Inclusion in the E-Service Society – Investigating Administrative Literacy Requirements for Using E-Services’. 6th International Conference (EGOV 2007, Regensburg, Germany), 4656&lt;/ref&gt; for a simple e-service, the needs for knowledge and skills, content and procedures are considerably less. However, in complicated services there are needed to change some prevailed skills, such as replacing verbal skills with skill in searching for information online.

===Benchmarking===
This theme is concerned with establishing standards for measuring e-services or the best practices within the field. This theme also includes the international benchmarking of e-government services (UN reports, EU reports); much critic has been targeting these reports being incomprehensive and useless. According to Bannister (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Bannister F. (2007). The curse of the benchmark: an assessment of the validity and value of e-government comparisons, International Review of Administrative Sciences, 73 (2), 171-188&lt;/ref&gt; “… benchmarks are not a reliable tool for measuring real e-government progress. Furthermore, if they are poorly designed, they risk distorting government policies as countries may chase the benchmark rather than looking at real local and national needs”

===Digital divide===
[[Digital divide]] is considered one of the main barriers to implementing e-services; some people do not have means to access the e-services and some others do not know how to use the technology (or the e-service). According to Helbig et al. (2009),&lt;ref&gt;Helbig, N; Gil-García, J ; Ferro, E (2009). Understanding the complexity of electronic government: Implications from the digital divide literature. Government Information Quarterly, 26(2009), 89–97&lt;/ref&gt; “we suggest E-Government and the digital divide should be seen as complementary social phenomena (i.e., demand and supply). Moreover, a serious e-government digital divide is that services mostly used by social elites."

===E-readiness===
Most of the reports and the established criteria focus on assessing the services in terms of infrastructure and public policies ignoring the citizen participation or [[e-readiness]]. According to by Shalini (2009),&lt;ref&gt;Shalini, R. (2009). Are Mauritians ready for e-Government services?. Government Information Quarterly 26 (2009) 536–539&lt;/ref&gt; “the results of the research project reveal that a high [http://www.eiu.com/site_info.asp?info_name=eiu_2007_e_readiness_rankings&amp;rf=0|e-readiness index] may be only indicating that a country is e-ready in terms of ICT infrastructure and info-structure, institutions, policies, and political commitment, but it is a very poor measure of the e-readiness of citizens. To summarize the findings, it can be said that Mauritius is ready but the Mauritians are not”

``E-readiness, as the Economist Intelligence Unit defines, is the measure of a country’s ability to leverage digital channels for communication, commerce and government in order to further economic and social development. Implied in this measure is the extent to which the usage of communications devices and Internet services creates efficiencies for business and citizens, and the extent to which this usage is leveraged in the development of information and communications technology (ICT) industries. In general terms, the definition of e-readiness is relative, for instance depending on a country in question's priorities and perspective.&lt;ref&gt;GeoSINC International (2002). E-Readiness Guide. Available at http://www.apdip.net/documents/evaluation/e-readiness/geosinc01042002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Efficiency===
As opposed to effectiveness, efficiency is focused on the internal competence within the government departments when delivering e-services. There is a complaint that researchers focus more on effectiveness “There is an emerging trend seemingly moving away from the efficiency target and focusing on users and governance outcome. While the latter is worthwhile, efficiency must still remain a key priority for eGovernment given the budget constraints compounded in the future by the costs of an ageing population. Moreover, efficiency gains are those that can be most likely proven empirically through robust methodologies”&lt;ref&gt;Codagnone, C.  Undheim T.A (2008).  Benchmarking eGovernment: tools, theory, and practice. European Journal of ePractice. Nº 4 • August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security===
Security is the most important challenge that faces the implementation of e-services because without a guarantee of privacy and security citizens will not be willing to take up e-government services. These security concerns, such as hacker attacks and the theft of credit card information, make governments hesitant to provide public online services.  According to the GAO report&lt;ref&gt;GAO.(2002). E-Government: Proposal addresses Critical Challenges. U.S General Accounting Office, Govt of the USA&lt;/ref&gt; of 2002 “security concerns present one of the toughest challenges to extending the reach of e-government.The rash of hacker attacks, Web page defacing, and credit card information being posted on electronic bulletin boards can make many federal agency officials—as well as the general public—reluctant to conduct sensitive government transactions involving personal or financial data over the Internet.” By and Large,  Security is one of the major challenges that faces the implementation and development of electronic services. people want to be assured that they are safe when they are conducting online services and that their information will remain secure and confidential

===Stakeholders===
Axelsson et al. (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Axelsson, K, Melin, f, Lindgren, I, (2009) DEVELOPING PUBLIC E-SERVICES FOR SEVERAL STAKEHOLDERS – A MULTIFACETED VIEW OF THE NEEDS FOR AN E-SERVICE. 17th European Conference on Information Systems&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the stakeholder concept-which was originally used in private firms-, can be used in public setting and in the context of e-government. According to them, several scholars have discussed the use of the [[stakeholder theory]] in public settings.&lt;ref&gt;Scholl, H. J. (2001). Applying stakeholder theory to e-government: Benefits and Limits. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt; The stakeholder theory suggests that need to focus on all the involved stakeholder s when designing the e-service; not only on the government and citizens.

===Usability===
Compared to Accessibility, There is sufficient literature that addresses the issue of usability; researchers have developed different models and methods to measure the usability and effectiveness of eGovernment websites. However, But still there is call to improve these measures and make it more compressive&lt;ref&gt;Kaylor, C.,  Deshazo, R. &amp; Eck, D. V. (2001) "Gauging e-government: A report on implementing services among American cities". Government Information Quarterly (GIQ), 18(4), 293 - 307&lt;/ref&gt;

``The word usability has cropped up a few times already in this unit. In the context of biometric identification, usability referred to the smoothness of enrollment and other tasks associated with setting up an identification system. A system that produced few false matches during enrollment of applicants was described as usable. Another meaning of usability is related to the ease of use of an interface. Although this meaning of the term is often used in the context of computer interfaces, there is no reason to confine it to computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlearn.open.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=211245 Open Learning - OpenLearn - Open University]&lt;/ref&gt;´´

==Social, cultural and ethical implications of e-services==
The perceived effectiveness of e-service can be influenced by public’s view of the social and cultural implications of e-technologies and e-service.

Impacts on individuals’ rights and privacy – as more and more companies and government agencies use technology to collect, store, and make accessible data on individuals, privacy concerns have grown. Some companies monitor their employees' computer usage patterns in order to assess individual or workgroup performance.&lt;ref&gt;Asgarkhani, M. (2002). Strategic Management of Information systems and Technology in an e-World”, Proceedings of the 21st IT Conference, Sri Lanka, pp103-111.&lt;/ref&gt; Technological advancements are also making it much easier for businesses, government and other individuals to obtain a great deal of information about an individual without their knowledge. There is a growing concern&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Asgarkhani, M. (2002b) “e-Governance in Asia Pacific”, Proceedings of the International Conference on Governance in Asia, Hong Kong.&lt;/ref&gt; that access to a wide range of information can be dangerous within politically corrupt government agencies.

Impact on Jobs and Workplaces - in the early days of computers, management scientists anticipated that computers would replace human decision-makers. However, despite significant technological advances, this prediction is no longer a mainstream concern. At the current time, one of the concerns associated with computer usage in any organization (including governments) is the health risk – such as injuries related to working continuously on a computer keyboard. Government agencies are expected to work with regulatory groups in order to avoid these problems.

Potential Impacts on Society – despite some economic benefits of ICT to individuals, there is evidence that the computer literacy and access gap between the haves and have-nots may be increasing. Education and information access are more than ever the keys to economic prosperity, yet access by individuals in different countries is not equal - this social inequity has become known as the digital divide.

Impact on Social Interaction – advancements in ICT and e-Technology solutions have enabled many government functions to become automated and information to be made available online. This is a concern to those who place a high value on social interaction.

Information Security - technological advancements allow government agencies to collect, store and make data available online to individuals and organizations. Citizens and businesses expect to be allowed to access data in a flexible manner (at any time and from any location). Meeting these expectations comes at a price to government agencies where it concerns managing information – more specifically, ease of access; data integrity and accuracy; capacity planning to ensure the timely delivery of data to remote (possibly mobile) sites; and managing the security of corporate and public information.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==E-service awards==
The benefits of e-services in advancing businesses efficiency and in promoting good governance are huge; recognizing the importance of these benefits has resulted in number of international awards that are dedicated to recognize the best designed e-services.

==Finance==
Kuwait has a leading position in the financial industry in the GCC; the abyss that separates Kuwait from its Gulf neighbors in terms of tourism, transport, and other measures of diversification is absent in the financial sector.&lt;ref name=wages&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=laODBQAAQBAJ|title=The Wages of Oil: Parliaments and Economic Development in Kuwait and the UAE|work=Michael Herb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emir has promoted the idea that Kuwait should focus its energies, in terms of economic development, on the financial industry.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt;

The historical preeminence of Kuwait (among the Gulf monarchies) in finance dates back to the founding of the [[National Bank of Kuwait]] in 1952.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt; The bank was the first local publicly traded corporation in the Gulf.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt; In the late 1970s and early 1980s, an alternative stock market, trading in shares of Gulf companies, emerged in Kuwait, the [[Souk Al-Manakh stock market crash|Souk Al-Manakh]].&lt;ref name=wages/&gt; At its peak, its market capitalization was the third highest in the world, behind only the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Japan]], and ahead of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[France]].&lt;ref name=wages/&gt;

Kuwait has a large wealth-management industry that stands out in the region.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt; Kuwaiti investment companies administer more assets than those of any other GCC country, save the much larger Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt; The Kuwait Financial Centre, in a rough calculation, estimated that Kuwaiti firms accounted for over one-third of the total assets under management in the GCC.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt; The relative strength of Kuwait in the financial industry extends to its stock market.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt; For many years, the total valuation of all companies listed on the Kuwaiti exchange far exceeded the value of those on any other GCC bourse, except Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt; In 2011, financial and banking companies made up more than half of the market capitalization of the Kuwaiti bourse; among all the Gulf states, the market capitalization of Kuwaiti financial-sector firms was, in total, behind only that of Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt;

In recent years, Kuwaiti investment companies have invested large percentages of their assets abroad, and their foreign assets have become substantially larger than their domestic assets.&lt;ref name=wages/&gt;

Kuwait is a major source of foreign economic assistance to other states through the [[Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development]], an autonomous state institution created in 1961 on the pattern of Western and international development agencies. Over the years aid was annually provided to Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, as well as the Palestine Liberation Organization. In 1974, the fund's lending mandate was expanded to include all developing countries in the world.

== Oil ==
{{main|Oil industry of Kuwait}}
{{See also|Oil reserves in Kuwait|Petroleum industry in Kuwait}}
In 1934, the Emir of Kuwait granted an oil concession to the [[Kuwait Oil Co.|Kuwait Oil Co. (KOC)]], jointly owned by the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company|Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (later [[BP|British Petroleum Company]]) and [[Gulf Oil Corporation]] In 1976, the Kuwaiti Government nationalized KOC. The following year, Kuwait took over onshore production in the Divided Zone between Kuwait and [[Saudi Arabia]]. KOC produces jointly there with [[Texaco]], Inc., which, by its 1984 purchase of [[Getty Oil]] Co., acquired the Saudi Arabian onshore concession in the Divided Zone.

In the Offshore Divided Zone, the Arabian Oil Co. – 80% owned by Japanese interests and 10% each by the Kuwaiti and Saudi Governments – has produced on behalf of both countries since 1961. The original concession agreements have expired on January 2003; negotiations to replace the concession with a technical service agreement were completed in 2002.

The [[Kuwait Petroleum Corporation]] (KPC), an integrated international oil company, is the parent company of the government's operations in the petroleum sector, and includes Kuwait Oil Company, which produced oil and gas; Kuwait National Petroleum Co., refining and domestic sales; Petrochemical Industries Co., producing ammonia and urea; Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co., with several concessions in developing countries; Kuwait Oil Tanker Co.; and Santa Fe International Corp. The latter, purchased outright in 1982, gives KPC a worldwide presence in the petroleum industry.

KPC also has purchased from Gulf Oil Co. refineries and associated service stations in the Benelux nations and Scandinavia, as well as storage facilities and a network of service stations in Italy. In 1987, KPC bought a 19% share in British Petroleum, which was later reduced to 10%. KPC markets its products in Europe under the brand [[Kuwait Petroleum Corporation|Q8]] and is interested in the markets of the United States and Japan.

Kuwait has about {{convert|94|Goilbbl|km3}} of recoverable oil reserves. Estimated capacity, before the war, was about {{convert|2.4|Moilbbl/d}}. During the Iraqi occupation, Kuwait's oil-producing capacity was reduced to practically nothing. However, tremendous recovery and improvements have been made since. Oil production was {{convert|1.5|Moilbbl/d}} by the end of 1992, and pre-war capacity was restored in 1993. Kuwait's production capacity is estimated to be {{convert|2.5|Moilbbl/d}}. Kuwait plans to increase its capacity to {{convert|3.5|Moilbbl/d}} by 2005.

==Reserve funds==
{{main|Kuwait Investment Authority}}
[[File:Kuwait Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|450px|A proportional representation of Kuwait's exports.]]
The [[Kuwait Investment Authority]] (KIA) is Kuwait's [[sovereign wealth fund]] specializing in foreign investment. The KIA is the world's oldest sovereign wealth fund. Since 1953, the Kuwaiti government has directed investments into Europe, United States and [[Asia Pacific]]. {{As of|2015}}, the holdings were valued at $592 billion in assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swfinstitute.org/swfs/kuwait-investment-authority/ |title=Kuwait Investment Authority Profile Page |publisher=[[Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute]] |accessdate=12 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the [[Sovereign wealth fund#Largest sovereign wealth funds|5th largest]] sovereign wealth fund in the world.

The KIA manages two funds: the General Reserve Fund (GRF) and Future Generations Fund (FGF).&lt;ref name="kia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fletcher.tufts.edu/SWFI-OLD/~/media/Fletcher/Microsites/swfi/pdfs/2012/profiles/KIA%20Fund%20Profile_v2.pdf |title=Fund Profile: Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA)|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GRF is the main treasurer for the government.&lt;ref name=kia/&gt; It receives all state revenues and all national expenditures are paid out of this fund.&lt;ref name=kia/&gt; The KIA does not disclose its financial assets in public, but it is estimated that the KIA has $410 billion in assets as of February 2014.

The KIA was the main source of capital for the Kuwaiti government during the [[Gulf War]]. The Kuwaiti government relied on the KIA to pay for coalition expenses and postwar reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ideationcenter.com/ideation_research/ideation_article/vital_role_of_sovereign_wealth_funds_in_the_gcc
|title=The Vital Role of Sovereign Wealth Funds in the GCC's Future}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KIA was worth $100 billion prior to 1990, KIA funds were depleted to $40–$50 billion after the Gulf War.

===Future Generations Fund===
The Future Generations Fund (FGF) was created in 1976 by transferring 50% from the general reserve fund at that time. The FGF is a saving funds for future generations. 25% of all state revenues are annually transferred to the fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccsi.columbia.edu/files/2014/04/nrf_Kuwait_September2013_RWI_VCC.pdf|title=Kuwait’s Future Generations Fund |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the FGF is invested abroad, with an estimated 75% invested in the US and [[Europe]] and the rest in emerging markets, mainly China and India.

==Agriculture==
In 2017, agriculture (including fisheries) accounts for almost 0.4 percent of the [[gross domestic product]] and does not offer an important source of employment.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; Around 4 percent of the economically active population works in agriculture, almost all foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.AGR.EMPL.ZS?name_desc=true|title=Employment in agriculture (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of farm owners are investors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The agricultural sector provides fruit and vegetables for sale in the country's supermarkets.

The government has experimented in growing food through [[hydroponics]] and carefully managed farms. However, most of the soil which was suitable for farming in south central Kuwait was destroyed when Iraqi troops set fire to oil wells in the area and created vast "oil lakes". Fish and shrimp are plentiful in territorial waters, and largescale [[commercial fishing]] has been undertaken locally and in the [[Indian Ocean]].

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in Kuwait}}
[[File:Kuwait highway.jpg|thumb|300px|A highway in Kuwait City]]

Kuwait has an extensive and modern network of [[highway]]s. Roadways extended {{convert|5749|km|0|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|4887|km|0|abbr=on}} is paved. There are more than 2 million passenger cars, and 500,000 commercial taxis, buses, and trucks in use. On major highways the maximum speed is {{convert|120|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. Since there is no railway system in the country, most people travel by automobiles.

The country's public transportation network consists almost entirely of bus routes. The state owned Kuwait Public Transportation Company was established in 1962. It runs local bus routes across Kuwait as well as longer distance services to other Gulf states.&lt;ref name=KPTC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kptc.com.kw/newenglish/index.html|title=Public Transport Services|publisher=Kuwait Public Transportation Company|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main private bus company is CityBus, which operates about 20 routes across the country. Another private bus company, Kuwait Gulf Link Public Transport Services, was started in 2006. It runs local bus routes across Kuwait and longer distance services to neighbouring Arab countries.&lt;ref name=KGL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kglpts.com|title=Public Transport Services|publisher=KGL|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202091806/http://www.kglpts.com/|archivedate=2 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two airports in Kuwait. [[Kuwait International Airport]] serves as the principal hub for international air travel. State-owned [[Kuwait Airways]] is the largest airline in the country. A portion of the airport complex is designated as Al Mubarak Air Base, which contains the headquarters of the [[Kuwait Air Force]], as well as the Kuwait Air Force Museum. In 2004, the first private airline of Kuwait, [[Jazeera Airways]], was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2002594401_kuwait31.html|title=First flight for Kuwait's Jazeera Airways|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=31 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the second private airline, [[Wataniya Airways]] was founded.

Kuwait has one of the largest shipping industries in the region. The Kuwait Ports Public Authority manages and operates ports across Kuwait. The country’s principal commercial seaports are [[Shuwaikh]] and Shuaiba which handled combined cargo of 753,334 TEU in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/13916-kuwaits-ports-continue-to-break-records- |title=Kuwait's ports continue to break records – Transportation|work=ArabianBusiness.com|date=4 June 2007|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mina Al-Ahmadi, the largest port in the country, handles most of Kuwait's oil exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/mina-al-ahmadi.htm|title=Mina Al Ahmadi, Kuwait|work=Globalsecurity.org|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of another major port located in [[Bubiyan]] island started in 2007. The port is expected to handle 1.3 million [[Twenty-foot equivalent unit|TEU]] when operations start.

{{Electoral systems}}

An '''electoral system''' is a set of rules that determine how elections and referendums are conducted and how their results are determined. Political electoral systems are organized by governments, while non-political elections may take place in business, non-profit organisations and informal organisations.

Electoral systems consist of sets of rules that govern all aspects of the voting process: when elections occur, [[suffrage|who is allowed to vote]], who can stand as a candidate, [[voting method|how ballots are marked and cast]], how the ballots are counted (electoral method), limits on [[campaign finance|campaign spending]], and other factors that can affect the outcome. Political electoral systems are defined by constitutions and electoral laws, are typically conducted by [[election commission]]s, and can use multiple types of elections for different offices.

Some electoral systems elect a single winner to a unique position, such as prime minister, president or governor, while others elect multiple winners, such as members of parliament or boards of directors. There are a large number of variations in electoral systems, but the most common systems are [[first-past-the-post voting]], the [[two-round system|two-round (runoff) system]], [[proportional representation]] and [[Ranked voting|ranked or preferential voting]]. Some electoral systems, such as [[mixed electoral system|mixed systems]], attempt to combine the benefits of non-proportional and proportional systems.

The study of formally defined electoral methods is called [[social choice theory]] or voting theory, and this study can take place within the field of [[political science]], [[economics]], or [[mathematics]], and specifically within the subfields of [[game theory]] and [[mechanism design]]. Impossibility proofs such as [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] demonstrates that when voters have three or more alternatives, it is not possible to design a [[ranked voting]] electoral system that reflects the preferences of individuals in a global preference of the community, present in countries with [[proportional representation]] and [[plurality voting]].

==Types of electoral systems==
===Plurality systems===
[[File:Countries That Use a First Past the Post Voting System.png|thumb|right|Countries using first-past-the-post for legislatures.]]

[[Plurality voting method|Plurality voting]] is a system in which the candidate(s) with the highest amount of vote wins, with no requirement to get a majority of votes. In cases where there is a single position to be filled, it is known as [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]]; this is the second most common electoral system for national legislatures, with 58 countries using it to elect their legislatures,&lt;ref name=IDEA&gt;[http://www.oldsite.idea.int/esd/world.cfm Table of Electoral Systems Worldwide] IDEA&lt;/ref&gt; the vast majority of which are current or former British or American colonies or territories. It is also the second most common system used for presidential elections, being used in 19 countries.&lt;ref name=IDEA/&gt;

In cases where there are multiple positions to be elected, most commonly in cases of multi-member constituencies, plurality voting is referred to as [[Plurality-at-large voting|bloc voting]] or plurality-at-large.&lt;ref name=IDEA/&gt; This takes two main forms; in one form voters have as many votes as there are seats and can vote for any candidate, regardless of party – this is used in eight countries.&lt;ref name=IDEA/&gt; There are variations on this system such as [[limited voting]], where voters are given fewer votes than there are seats to be elected ([[Gibraltar]] is the only territory where this system is in use)&lt;ref name=IDEA/&gt; and [[single non-transferable vote]] (SNTV), in which voters are only able to vote for one candidate in a multi-member constituency, with the candidates receiving the most votes declared the winners; this system is used in [[Afghanistan]], [[Kuwait]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]] and [[Vanuatu]].&lt;ref name=IDEA/&gt; In the other main form of bloc voting, also known as party bloc voting, voters can only vote for the multiple candidates of a single party. This is used in five countries as part of mixed systems.&lt;ref name=IDEA/&gt;

The Dowdall system, a multi-member constituency variation on the [[Borda count]], is used in [[Nauru]] for parliamentary elections and sees voters rank the candidates depending on how many seats there are in their constituency. First preference votes are counted as whole numbers; the second preference votes divided by two, third preferences by three; this continues to the lowest possible ranking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2227_B.htm Nauru Parliament: Electoral system] IPU&lt;/ref&gt; The sums achieved by each candidate are then totalled to determine the winner.&lt;ref name=IDG&gt;[http://www.oldsite.idea.int/esd/glossary.cfm# Glossary of Terms] IDEA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Majoritarian systems===
Majoritarian voting is a system in which candidates have to receive a majority of the votes to be elected, although in some cases only a plurality is required in the last round of counting if no candidate can achieve a majority. There are two main forms of majoritarian systems, one using a single round of [[Ranked voting system|ranked voting]] and the other using two or more rounds. Both are primarily used for single-member constituencies.

Majoritarian voting can take place in a single round using [[instant-runoff voting]] (IRV), whereby voters rank candidates in order of preference; this system is used for parliamentary elections in [[Australia]] and [[Papua New Guinea]]. If no candidate receives a majority of the vote in the first round, the second preferences of the lowest-ranked candidate are then added to the totals. This is repeated until a candidate achieves over 50% of the number of valid votes. If not all voters use all their preference votes, then the count may continue until two candidates remain, at which point the winner is the one with the most votes. A modified form of IRV is the [[contingent vote]] where voters do not rank all candidates, but have a limited number of preference votes. If no candidate has a majority in the first round, all candidates are excluded except the top two, with the highest remaining preference votes from the votes for the excluded candidates then added to the totals to determine the winner. This system is used in [[Sri Lanka]]n presidential elections, with voters allowed to give three preferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/2813/ Sri Lanka: Election for President] IFES&lt;/ref&gt;

The other main form of majoritarian system is the [[two-round system]], which is the most common system used for presidential elections around the world, being used in 88 countries. It is also used in 20 countries for electing the legislature.&lt;ref name=IDEA/&gt; If no candidate achieves a majority of votes in the first round of voting, a second round is held to determine the winner. In most cases the second round is limited to the top two candidates from the first round, although in some elections more than two candidates may choose to contest the second round; in these cases the second round is decided by plurality voting. Some countries use a modified form of the two-round system, such as [[Ecuador]] where a candidate in the presidential election is declared the winner if they receive 40% of the vote and is 10% ahead of their nearest rival,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/2265/ Ecuador: Election for President] IFES&lt;/ref&gt; or Argentina (45% plus 10% ahead), where the system is known as [[Ballotage in Argentina|ballotage]].

An [[exhaustive ballot]] is not limited to two rounds, but sees the last-placed candidate eliminated in the round of voting. Due to the large potential number of rounds, this system is not used in any major popular elections, but is used to elect the Speakers of parliament in several countries and members of the [[Swiss Federal Council]]. In some formats there may be multiple rounds held without any candidates being removed until a candidate achieves a majority, a system used in the [[Electoral College (United States)|United States Electoral College]].

===Proportional systems===
[[File:Proportional voting systems.png|thumb|right|250px|Countries by type of proportional system]]

[[Proportional representation]] is the most widely used electoral system for national legislatures, with the parliaments of over eighty countries elected by various forms of the system.

[[Party-list proportional representation]] is the single most common electoral system and is used by 80 countries, and involves voters voting for a list of candidates proposed by a party. In [[closed list]] systems voters do not have any influence over the candidates put forward by the party, but in [[open list]] systems voters are able to both vote for the party list and influence the order in which candidates will be assigned seats. In some countries, notably [[Israel]] and the [[Netherlands]], elections are carried out using 'pure' proportional representation, with the votes tallied on a national level before assigning seats to parties. However, in most cases several multi-member constituencies are used rather than a single nationwide constituency, giving an element of geographical representation. However, this can result in the distribution of seats not reflecting the national vote totals. As a result, some countries have [[leveling seat]]s to award to parties whose seat totals are lower than their proportion of the national vote.

In addition to the [[electoral threshold]], the minimum percentage of the vote that a party must obtain to win seats, there are several different methods for calculating seat allocation in proportional systems, typically broken down into the two main types; [[highest averages method|highest average]] and [[Largest remainder method|largest remainder]]. Highest average systems involve dividing the votes received by each party by a series of divisors, producing figures that determine seat allocation; examples include the [[d'Hondt method]] (of which there are variants including [[Hagenbach-Bischoff system|Hagenbach-Bischoff]]) or the [[Webster/Sainte-Laguë method]]. Under largest remainder systems, party's vote shares are divided by the quota (obtained by dividing the number of votes by the number of seats available). This usually leaves some seats unallocated, which are awarded to parties based on the largest fractions of seats that they have remaining. Examples of largest remainder systems include the [[Hare quota]], [[Droop quota]], the [[Imperiali quota]] and the [[Hagenbach-Bischoff quota]].

[[Single transferable vote]] (STV) is another form of proportional representation, but is achieved by voters [[Ranked voting system|ranking]] candidates in a multi-member constituency by preference rather than voting for a party list; it is used in [[Malta]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]. To be elected, candidates must pass a quota (the [[Droop quota]] being the most common). Candidates that pass the quota on the first count are elected. Votes are then reallocated from the least successful candidates until the number of candidates that have passed the quota is equal to the number of seats to be filled.&lt;ref name=IDG/&gt;

===Mixed systems===
In several countries, [[mixed electoral system|mixed systems]] are used to elect the legislature. These include [[parallel voting]] and [[mixed-member proportional representation]].

In parallel voting systems, which are used in 20 countries,&lt;ref name=IDEA/&gt; there are two methods by which members of a legislature are elected; part of the membership is elected by a plurality or majority vote in single-member constituencies and the other part by proportional representation. The results of the constituency vote has no effect on the outcome of the proportional vote.&lt;ref name=IDG/&gt;

Mixed-member proportional representation, in use in eight countries, also sees the membership of the legislature elected by constituency and proportional methods, but the results of the proportional vote are adjusted to balance the seats won in the constituency vote in order to ensure that parties have a number of seats proportional to their vote share.&lt;ref name=IDEA/&gt; This may result in [[overhang seat]]s, where parties win more seats in the constituency system than they would be entitled to based on their vote share. Variations of this include the [[Additional Member System]] and [[Alternative Vote Plus]], in which voters rank candidates, and the other from multi-member constituencies elected on a proportional party list basis. A form of mixed-member proportional representation, [[Scorporo]], was used in Italy from 1993 until 2006.

===Additional features===
Some electoral systems feature a [[majority bonus system]] to either ensure one party or coalition gains a majority in the legislature, or to give the party receiving the most votes a clear advantage in terms of the number of seats. In [[Greece]] the party receiving the most votes is given an additional 50 seats,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2125_B.htm Hellenic Parliament: Electoral system] IPU&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Marino]] has a modified two-round system, which sees a second round of voting featuring the top two parties or coalitions if there is no majority in the first round. The winner of the second round is guaranteed 35 seats in the 60-seat [[Grand and General Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2273_B.htm Consiglio grande e generale: Electoral system] IPU&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Uruguay]], the President and members of the [[General Assembly of Uruguay|General Assembly]] are elected by on a single ballot, known as the double simultaneous vote. Voters cast a single vote, voting for the presidential, Senatorial and Chamber of Deputies candidates of that party. This system was also previously used in [[Bolivia]] and the [[Dominican Republic]].

===Primary elections===
[[Primary election]]s are a feature of some electoral systems, either as a formal part of the electoral system or informally by choice of individual political parties as a method of selecting candidates, as is the case in [[Primary elections in Italy|Italy]]. Primary elections limit the risk of [[vote splitting]] by ensuring a single party candidate. In [[Primary elections in Argentina|Argentina]] they are a formal part of the electoral system and take place two months before the main elections; any party receiving less than 1.5% of the vote is not permitted to contest the main elections. In the United States, there are both partisan and non-partisan [[Primary elections in the United States|primary elections]].

===Indirect elections===
Some elections feature an indirect electoral system, whereby there is either no popular vote, or the popular vote is only one stage of the election; in these systems the final vote is usually taken by an [[electoral college]]. In several countries, such as [[Mauritius]] or [[Trinidad and Tobago]], the post of President is elected by the legislature. In others like [[India]], the vote is taken by an electoral college consisting of the national legislature and state legislatures. In the [[United States]], the president is indirectly elected using a two-stage process; a popular vote in each state elects members to the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]] that in turn elects the President. This can result in a situation where a candidate who receives the most votes nationwide does not win the electoral college vote, as most recently happened in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] and [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016]].

===Systems used outside politics===
In addition to the various electoral systems in use in the political sphere, there are numerous others, some of which are proposals and some of which have been adopted for usage in business (such as electing corporate board members) or for organisations but not for public elections.

Ranked systems include [[Bucklin voting]], the various [[Condorcet method]]s ([[Copeland's method|Copeland's]], [[Dodgson's method|Dodgson's]], [[Kemeny–Young method|Kemeny-Young]], [[Maximal lotteries]], [[Minimax Condorcet|Minimax]], [[Nanson's method|Nanson's]], [[Ranked pairs]], [[Schulze method|Schulze]]), the [[Coombs' method]] and [[positional voting system|positional voting]]. There are also several variants of single transferable vote, including [[CPO-STV]], [[Schulze STV]] and the [[Wright system]]. [[Dual-member proportional representation]] is a proposed system with two candidates elected in each constituency, one with the most votes and one to ensure proportionality of the combined results. [[Biproportional apportionment]] is a system whereby the total number of votes is used to calculate the number of seats each party is due, followed by a calculation of the constituencies in which the seats should be awarded in order to achieve the total due to them.

[[Cardinal voting methods|Cardinal electoral systems]] allow voters to score candidates independently. The complexity ranges from [[approval voting]] where voters simply state whether they approve of a candidate or not to [[range voting]], where a candidate is scored from a set range of numbers. Other cardinal systems include [[Proportional approval voting]], [[sequential proportional approval voting]], [[Satisfaction approval voting]] and [[majority judgment]].

Historically, [[weighted voting]] systems were used in some countries. These allocated a greater weight to the votes of some voters than others, either indirectly by allocating more seats to certain groups (such as the [[Prussian three-class franchise]]), or by weighting the results of the vote. The latter system was used in colonial [[Rhodesia]] for the [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1962|1962]] and [[Rhodesian general election, 1965|1965 elections]]. The elections featured two voter rolls (the 'A' roll being largely European and the 'B' roll largely African); the seats of the House Assembly were divided into 50 constituency seats and 15 district seats. Although all voters could vote for both types of seats, 'A' roll votes were given greater weight for the constituency seats and 'B' roll votes greater weight for the district seats. Weighted systems are still used in corporate elections, with votes weighted to reflect stock ownership.

==Rules and regulations==
In addition to the specific method of electing candidates, electoral systems are also characterised by their wider rules and regulations, which are usually set out in a country's [[constitution]] or [[Election law|electoral law]]. Participatory rules determine [[nomination rules|candidate nomination]] and [[voter registration]], in addition to the location of [[polling places]] and the availability of [[online voting]], [[postal voting]], and [[absentee ballot|absentee voting]]. Other regulations include the selection of voting devices such as paper [[ballots]], [[machine voting]] or [[open ballot system]]s, and consequently the type of [[vote counting systems]], verification and [[Election audits|auditing]] used.

Electoral rules place limits on suffrage and candidacy. Most countries's electorates are characterised by [[universal suffrage]], but there are differences on the [[Voting age|age at which people are allowed to vote]], with the youngest being 16 and the oldest 21 (although voters must be 25 to vote in Senate elections in Italy). People may be disenfranchised for a range of reasons, such as being a serving prisoner, being declared bankrupt, having committed certain crimes or being a serving member of the armed forces. Similar limits are placed on candidacy (also known as passive suffrage), and in many cases the age limit for candidates is higher than the voting age. A total of 21 countries have [[compulsory voting]], although in some there is an upper age limit on enforcement of the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2123.html Suffrage] CIA World Factbook&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries also have the [[none of the above]] option on their ballot papers.

In systems that use [[Electoral district|constituencies]], [[Apportionment (politics)|apportionment]] or districting defines the area covered by each constituency. Where constituency boundaries are drawn has a strong influence on the likely outcome of elections in the constituency due to the geographic distribution of voters. Political parties may seek to gain an advantage during [[redistricting]] by ensuring their voter base has a majority in as many constituencies as possible, a process known as [[gerrymandering]]. Historically [[rotten and pocket boroughs]], constituencies with unusually small populations, were used by wealthy families to gain parliamentary representation.

Some countries have minimum turnout requirements for elections to be valid. In Serbia this rule caused multiple re-runs of presidential elections, with the 1997 election re-run once and the 2002 elections re-run three times due insufficient turnout in the [[Serbian presidential election, September–October 2002|first]], [[Serbian presidential election, December 2002|second]] and [[Serbian presidential election, 2003|third]] attempts to run the election. The turnout requirement was scrapped prior to the [[Serbian presidential election, 2004|fourth vote]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/pro-western-candidate-wins-serbian-presidential-poll/a-1248319 Pro-Western Candidate Wins Serbian Presidential Poll] Deutsche Welle, 28 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Similar problems in [[Belarus]] led to the [[Belarusian parliamentary election, 1995|1995 parliamentary elections]] going to a fourth round of voting before enough parliamentarains were elected to make a [[quorum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2027_95.htm Elections held in 1995] IPU&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reserved political positions|Reserved seats]] are used in many countries to ensure representation for ethnic minorities, women, young people or the disabled. These seats are separate from general seats, and may be elected separately (such as in Morocco where a separate ballot is used to elect the 60 seats reserved for women and 30 seats reserved for young people in the House of Representatives), or be allocated to parties based on the results of the election; in [[Jordan]] the reserved seats for women are given to the female candidates who failed to win constituency seats but with the highest number of votes, whilst in [[Kenya]] the Senate seats reserved for women, young people and the disabled are allocated to parties based on how many seats they won in the general vote. Some countries achieve minority representation by other means, including requirements for a certain proportion of candidates to be women, or by exempting minority parties from the electoral threshold, as is done in [[Poland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2255_B.htm Sejm: Electoral system] IPU&lt;/ref&gt; [[Romania]] and [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2355_B.htm Narodna skupstina: Electoral system] IPU&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Pre-democratic===
In [[ancient Greece]] and [[History of Italy|Italy]], the institution of suffrage already existed in a rudimentary form at the outset of the historical period. In the early [[Monarchy#History|monarchies]] it was customary for the king to invite pronouncements of his people on matters in which it was prudent to secure its assent beforehand. In these assemblies the people recorded their opinion by clamouring (a method which survived in [[Sparta]] as late as the 4th century BCE), or by the clashing of [[spear]]s on [[shield]]s.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Vote and Voting|volume=28|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Early democracy===
Voting has been used as a feature of democracy since the 6th century BC, when democracy was introduced by the [[Athenian democracy]]. However, in Athenian democracy, voting was seen as the least democratic among methods used for selecting public officials, and was little used, because elections were believed to inherently favor the wealthy and well-known over average citizens. Viewed as more democratic were assemblies open to all citizens, and selection by lot (known as [[sortition]]), as well as rotation of office.

Generally, the taking of votes was effected in the form of a poll. The practice of the Athenians, which is shown by inscriptions to have been widely followed in the other states of Greece, was to hold a show of hands, except on questions affecting the status of individuals: these latter, which included all [[lawsuit]]s and proposals of [[ostracism]], in which voters chose the citizen they most wanted to exile for ten years, were determined by secret ballot (one of the earliest recorded elections in Athens was a [[Plurality voting|plurality vote]] that it was undesirable to win, namely an ostracism vote). At [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] the method which prevailed up to the 2nd century BCE was that of division ({{lang|la|discessio}}). But the system became subject to intimidation and corruption. Hence a series of laws enacted between 139 and 107 BCE prescribed the use of the ballot ({{lang|la|tabella}}), a slip of wood coated with wax, for all business done in the assemblies of the people. 
For the purpose of carrying resolutions a simple majority of votes was deemed sufficient. As a general rule equal value was made to attach to each vote; but in the popular assemblies at Rome a system of voting by groups was in force until the middle of the 3rd century BCE by which the richer classes secured a decisive preponderance.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Most elections in the early [[history of democracy]] were held using plurality voting or some variant, but as an exception, the state of [[Venice]] in the 13th century adopted approval voting to elect their Great Council.&lt;ref name=JJ1&gt;
J.J. O'Connor &amp; E. F. Robertson [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Voting.html The history of voting] MacTutor History 
of Mathematics archive&lt;/ref&gt;
The Venetians' method for [[Doge of Venice#Selection of the Doge|electing the Doge]] was a particularly convoluted process, consisting of five rounds of drawing lots (sortition) and five rounds of approval voting. By drawing lots, a body of 30 electors was chosen, which was further reduced to nine electors by drawing lots again. An [[electoral college]] of nine members elected 40 people by approval voting; those 40 were reduced to form a second electoral college of 12 members by drawing lots again. The second electoral college elected 25 people by approval voting, which were reduced to form a third electoral college of nine members by drawing lots. The third electoral college elected 45 people, which were reduced to form a fourth electoral college of 11 by drawing lots. They in turn elected a final electoral body of 41 members, who ultimately elected the Doge. Despite its complexity, the method had certain desirable properties such as being hard to game and ensuring that the winner reflected the opinions of both majority and minority factions.&lt;ref name="dogeelection"&gt;Miranda Mowbray &amp;  Dieter Gollmann (2007) [http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2007/HPL-2007-28R1.pdf Electing the Doge of Venice: Analysis of a 13th Century Protocol]&lt;/ref&gt; This process, with slight modifications, was central to the politics of the [[Republic of Venice]] throughout its remarkable lifespan of over 500 years, from 1268 to 1797.

===Development of new systems===
Jean-Charles de Borda proposed the Borda count in 1770 as a method for electing members to the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. His method was opposed by the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], who proposed instead the method of pairwise comparison that he had devised. Implementations of this method are known as Condorcet methods. He also wrote about the [[Condorcet paradox]], which he called the ''intransitivity of majority preferences''. However, recent research has shown that the philosopher [[Ramon Llull]] devised both the Borda count and a pairwise method that satisfied the Condorcet criterion in the 13th century. The manuscripts in which he described these methods had been lost to history until they were rediscovered in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;G. Hägele &amp; F. Pukelsheim (2001) "[https://www.math.uni-augsburg.de/htdocs/emeriti/pukelsheim/2001a.html Llull's writings on electoral systems]", ''Studia Lulliana'' Vol. 3, pp3–38&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 18th century, [[Apportionment (politics)|apportionment methods]] came to prominence due to the [[United States Constitution]], which mandated that seats in the [[United States House of Representatives]] had to be allocated among the states proportionally to their population, but did not specify how to do so.&lt;ref name=JM&gt;[http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcarc-apportion1 Apportionment: Introduction] American Mathematical Society&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of methods were proposed by statesmen such as [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Daniel Webster]]. Some of the apportionment methods devised in the United States were in a sense rediscovered in Europe in the 19th century, as seat allocation methods for the newly proposed method of party-list proportional representation. The result is that many apportionment methods have two names; ''Jefferson's method'' is equivalent to the [[d'Hondt method]], as is ''Webster's method'' to the [[Sainte-Laguë method]], while ''Hamilton's method'' is identical to the Hare largest remainder method.&lt;ref name=JM/&gt;

The [[single transferable vote]] (STV) method was devised by [[Carl Andræ]] in [[Denmark]] in 1855 and in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Thomas Hare (political scientist)|Thomas Hare]] in 1857. STV elections were first held in Denmark in 1856, and in [[Tasmania]] in 1896 after its use was promoted by [[Andrew Inglis Clark]]. Party-list proportional representation began to be used to elect European legislatures in the early 20th century, with [[Belgium]] the first to implement it for its [[Belgian general election, 1900|1900 general elections]]. Since then, proportional and semi-proportional methods have come to be used in almost all democratic countries, with most exceptions being former [[British Empire|British]] colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairvote.org/?page=53 Proportional Voting Around the World] [[FairVote]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Single-winner revival===
Perhaps influenced by the rapid development of multiple-winner electoral systems, theorists began to publish new findings about single-winner methods in the late 19th century. This began around 1870, when [[William Robert Ware]] proposed applying STV to single-winner elections, yielding [[instant-runoff voting]] (IRV).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091028050940/http://www.fairvote.org/irv/vt_lite/history.htm The History of IRV] [[FairVote]]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, mathematicians began to revisit Condorcet's ideas and invent new methods for Condorcet completion; [[Edward J. Nanson]] combined the newly described instant runoff voting with the Borda count to yield a new Condorcet method called [[Nanson's method]]. Charles Dodgson, better known as [[Lewis Carroll]], proposed the straightforward Condorcet method known as [[Dodgson's method]] as well as a proportional multiwinner method based on [[proxy voting]].

Ranked voting electoral systems eventually gathered enough support to be adopted for use in government elections. In [[Australia]], IRV was first adopted in 1893, and continues to be used along with STV today. In the United States in the early-20th-century [[progressive era]], some municipalities began to use [[Bucklin voting]], although this is no longer used in any government elections, and has even been declared unconstitutional in [[Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;Tony Anderson Solgård &amp; Paul Landskroener (2002) "[https://web.archive.org/web/20090204174848/http://www2.mnbar.org/benchandbar/2002/oct02/voting.htm Municipal Voting System Reform: Overcoming the Legal Obstacles]", Bench &amp; Bar of Minnesota, Vol. 59, no. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent developments===
{{Main|Electoral reform}}
The use of [[game theory]] to analyze electoral systems led to discoveries about the effects of certain methods. Earlier developments such as [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] had already shown the issues with [[Ranked voting]] systems. Research led [[Steven Brams]] and [[Peter C. Fishburn|Peter Fishburn]] to formally define and promote the use of [[approval voting]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Poundstone, William (2008) ''Gaming the Vote: Why Elections Aren't Fair (and What We Can Do About It)'', Hill and Young, p198&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientists of the 20th century published many studies on the effects that the electoral systems have on voters' choices and political parties,&lt;ref&gt;Duverger, Maurice (1954) ''Political Parties'', Wiley {{ISBN|0-416-68320-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas W. Rae (1971) ''The Political Consequences of Electoral Laws'', Yale University Press {{ISBN|0-300-01517-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rein Taagapera &amp; Matthew S. Shugart (1989) ''Seats and Votes: The Effects and Determinants of Electoral Systems'', Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and on political stability.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand A. Hermens (1941) ''Democracy or Anarchy? A Study of Proportional Representation'', University of Notre Dame.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arend Lijphart (1994) ''Electoral Systems and Party Systems: A Study of Twenty-Seven Democracies, 1945–1990'' Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-828054-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few scholars also studied which effects caused a nation to switch to a particular electoral system.&lt;ref&gt;Arend Lijphart (1985) "The Field of Electoral Systems Research: A Critical Survey" Electoral Studies, Vol.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arend Lijphart (1992) "Democratization and Constitutional Choices in Czecho-Slovakia, Hungary and Poland, 1989–1991" ''Journal of Theoretical Politics'' Vol. 4 (2), pp207–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein Rokkan (1970) ''Citizens, Elections, Parties: Approaches to the Comparative Study of the Process of Development'', Universitetsforlaget&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Rogowski (1987) "Trade and the Variety of Democratic Institutions", ''International Organization'' Vol. 41, pp203–24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Carles Boix]] (1999) "Setting the Rules of the Game: The Choice of Electoral Systems in Advanced Democracies", ''American Political Science Review'' Vol. 93 (3), pp609–24&lt;/ref&gt; One prominent current voting theorist is [[Nicolaus Tideman]], who formalized concepts such as [[strategic nomination]] and the [[spoiler effect]] in the [[independence of clones criterion]]. Tideman also devised the ranked pairs method, a Condorcet method that is not susceptible to [[Independence of clones criterion|clones]].

The study of electoral systems influenced a new push for [[electoral reform]] beginning around the 1990s, with proposals being made to replace plurality voting in governmental elections with other methods. [[New Zealand]] adopted mixed-member proportional representation for the [[New Zealand general election, 1993|1993 general elections]] and STV for some local elections in 2004. After plurality voting was a key factor in the contested results of the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential elections]] in the United States, various municipalities in the United States began to adopt IRV, although some of them subsequently returned to their prior method. However, attempts at introducing more proportional systems were not always successful; in Canada there were two referendums in British Columbia in [[British Columbia electoral reform referendum, 2005|2005]] and [[British Columbia electoral reform referendum, 2009|2009]] on adopting an [[BC-STV|STV]] method, both of which failed. In the [[United Kingdom]], a [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011|2011 referendum]] on adopting [[Instant-runoff voting]] saw the proposal rejected.

In other countries there were calls for the restoration of plurality or majoritarian systems or their establishment where they have never been used; [[Ecuadorian referendum, 1994|a referendum]] was held in Ecuador in 1994 on the adoption the two round system, but the idea was rejected. In Romania a proposal to switch to a two-round system for parliamentary elections failed only because [[voter turnout]] in [[Romanian electoral system referendum, 2007|the referendum]] was too low. Attempts to [[Polish referendum, 2015|reintroduce single-member constituencies]] in Poland (2015) and [[Bulgarian referendum, 2016|two-round system]] in Bulgaria (2016) via referendums both also failed due to low turnout.

==Comparison of electoral systems==
{{main|Comparison of electoral systems}}

Electoral systems can be compared by different means. Attitudes towards systems are highly influenced by the systems' impact on groups that one supports or opposes, which can make the objective comparison of voting systems difficult. There are several ways to address this problem:

One approach is to define criteria mathematically, such that any electoral system either passes or fails. This gives perfectly objective results, but their practical relevance is still arguable.

Another approach is to define ideal criteria that no electoral system passes perfectly, and then see how often or how close to passing various methods are over a large sample of simulated elections. This gives results which are practically relevant, but the method of generating the sample of simulated elections can still be arguably biased.

A final approach is to create imprecisely defined criteria, and then assign a neutral body to evaluate each method according to these criteria. This approach can look at aspects of electoral systems which the other two approaches miss, but both the definitions of these criteria and the evaluations of the methods are still inevitably subjective.

[[Arrow's impossibility theorem|Arrow's]] and [[Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem|Gibbard's]] theorems prove that no system using ranked voting or cardinal voting, can meet all such criteria simultaneously.  Instead of debating the importance of different criteria, another method is to simulate many elections with different electoral systems, and estimate the typical overall happiness of the population with the results,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://electology.github.io/vse-sim/VSE/|title=What is Voter Satisfaction Efficiency?|last=|first=|date=|website=electology.github.io|publisher=Center for Election Science|access-date=2017-03-30|quote=(VSE) is a way of measuring the outcome quality [of] a voting method ... highest average happiness would have a VSE of 100%. ... it's impossible for a method to pass all desirable criteria ... VSE measures how well a method makes those tradeoffs by using outcomes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rangevoting.org/BayRegDum.html|title=Bayesian Regret|last=|first=|date=|website=RangeVoting.org|access-date=2017-03-30|quote=The 'Bayesian regret' of an election method E is the 'expected avoidable human unhappiness'}}&lt;/ref&gt; their vulnerability to strategic voting, their likelihood of electing the candidate closest to the average voter, etc.

The '''Embassy of Serbia''' in [[Vienna]] ({{lang-de|Botschaft der Republik Serbien in der Republik Österreich}}, {{lang-sr|Амбасада Републике Србије у Републици Аустрији}}) is [[Serbia]]'s diplomatic mission to [[Austria]]. It is located at Ölzeltgasse 3, in Vienna, Austria.

The current Serbian [[ambassador]] to Austria is [[Pero Janković]].

== Consulates ==
Serbia also maintains the Consulate General in [[Salzburg]], currently under the Consul General Zoran Jeremić. There also Permanent Mission to the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] and [[United Nations]] under Chargé d'Affaires Miroslava Beham in Vienna. Serbia closed the Consulate General in [[Graz]] which was inherited from [[Yugoslavia]].

== History ==
{{main|Palais Hoyos (Rennweg)}}
Embassy of Serbia in Vienna used to be situated in the historic [[Palais Hoyos (Rennweg)|Palais Hoyos]] until 2011 when the building was handed over to [[Croatia]] as part of Yugoslav succession. The palace was built at the end of the 19th century by [[Otto Wagner]], together with two outbuildings. The palace was built in the style of the [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]], the facade was held to the [[Rococo]] and [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]]. In 1957 the palace of Hoyos in Rennweg was sold from the immovable of the family Hoyos to [[Yugoslavia]] which furnished it in the Embassy of Yugoslavia in [[Austria]]. After dissolution of Yugoslavia, the building went over in the possession of [[Serbia]]. In 2009 the palace was thoroughly restored.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24051">[[Environmental governance]] is a concept in [[environmental policy]] that steers [[markets]], [[technology]] and [[society]] towards achieving the goal of [[sustainability]]. It considers [[social]], [[economic]] and [[Environmental policy|environmental]] aspects in the decision making of its policies.

[[Brazil]] is currently developing at an incredibly fast rate, only out-performed by countries such as [[China]] and [[India]], both in terms of [[economic growth]] &lt;ref name="UN, 2010"&gt;UN (2010). World Economic Situation and Prospects 2010 [online] Available at: http://www.un.org/esa/policy/wess/wesp2010files/pr_en2010.pdf [Accessed 14 May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; and recovery rate after the global financial crisis in the late 2000s.&lt;ref name="Mussa, 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mussa|first1=Michael|authorlink1=Michael Mussa|title=Global Economic Prospects for 2010 and 2011: Global Recovery Continues|url=http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/mussa0410.pdf|accessdate=11 July 2014|work=[[Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics]]|issue=Paper presented at the 17th semiannual meeting on Global Economic Prospects|date=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The saying that “Brazil is the country of the future...and it always will be” has haunted Brazil for decades.&lt;ref name="Luparia, 2009"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Luparia|first1=Sebastian|title=The Future Is Now: Why Brazil may be the strongest BRIC|url=https://www.jpmorgan.com/cm/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobheader=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobwhere=1158630205842&amp;ssbinary=true|accessdate=11 July 2014|work=J.P. Morgan Asset Management|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; But recent [[economic policy]] changes, made since the founding of the New Republic, have allowed Brazil to start gaining international confidence. This was epitomised when American President [[Barack Obama]] stated that “The people of Brazil should know that the future has arrived” during a visit to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in March 2011.&lt;ref name="Carrenho, 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carrenho|first1=Carlo|title=Brazil Is the Country of the Future, and the Future is Now|url=http://publishingperspectives.com/2011/04/brazil-country-of-the-future/|work=Publishing Perspectives|date=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil is also no longer referred to as a [[developing country]], but as an [[emerging country]], a [[newly industrialised country]] (NIC) and as a member of the [[BRIC]] economies. But with this fast economic growth rate comes huge responsibility in terms of sustainability. Brazil’s economic growth is supported by the huge demand of [[natural resources]] from China, resources that Brazil has in abundance. Brazil is currently successfully matching the needs of China’s manufacturing industry and with huge investments currently being made to sustain this demand from China, Brazil is building new ports and airports and increasing the capacity of its current ones.&lt;ref name="Phillips, 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillips|first1=Tom|title=Brazil’s highway to China|url=https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/4026-Brazil-s-highway-to-China|work=China Dialogue|date=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this vast extraction of natural resources is coming at a price for the [[natural environment]]. Former Environment Minister [[Marina Silva]] resigned in 2008 as she felt the Brazilian government was prioritizing the interests of big businesses and the economy, and felt she was fighting a losing battle to protect many of Brazil’s natural environments, including the [[Amazon Rainforest]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence et al., 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=William F.

Despite these claims, Brazil has been praised for its environmental sustainability efforts and attempts to reduce its [[carbon emissions]].&lt;ref name="Anon., 2008"&gt;[http://www.portofentry.com/site/root/resources/industry_news/7385.html "Brazil wants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 4.8 billion tons"], Port of Entry, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Earth Times, 2009"&gt; [http://www.clima.md/libview.php?l=en&amp;idc=76&amp;id=169 "Brazil aims to reduce CO2 emission by almost 40 per cent"], ''Earth Times'', 15 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calmon et al., 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Miguel Calmon|author2=Pedro H.&amp;nbsp;S.

Brazil has also taken a front seat with regards to global environmental governance by jointly creating and presiding the Megadiverse Like-Minded Countries Group, which includes 70% of the world’s living [[biodiversity]] and 45% of the world’s population.&lt;ref name="Barros-Platiau, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barros-Platiau|first1=Ana Flávia|title=When emergent countries reform global governance of climate change: Brazil under Lula|journal=Revista Brasileira de Política Internacional|date=December 2010|volume=53|doi=10.1590/S0034-73292010000300005|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0034-73292010000300005&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Environmental Policy ==

In 1981, the Brazilian government put into force the National Environmental Policy (NEP), through Law No. 6938.&lt;ref name="Brasil, 1981"&gt;Brasil, Leis (1981). Política Nacional do Meio Ambiente, lei n. 6938 de 31 de agosto de 1981. Dispõe sobre a Política Nacional do Meio Ambiente, seus fins e mecanismos de formulação e aplicação. Legislação Federal, Controle da Poluição Ambiental. Série Documentos. São Paulo: CETESB&lt;/ref&gt; The main objective of this policy is to establish standards that make sustainable development possible, using mechanisms and instruments that are capable of ensuring greater protection for the environment. The NEP covers many environmental issues, including the definition of standards, licensing, [[environmental impact assessments]], special areas for preservation, incentives for cleaner production, and environmental zoning.&lt;ref name="Ometto et al., 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A.&amp;nbsp;R. Ometto|author2=A.&amp;nbsp;Guelere Filho|author3=M.&amp;nbsp;P.

These principles are as follows:&lt;ref name="Figueiredo, 1981"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[João Figueiredo]] | title= 1981 Política Nacional Do Meio Ambiente|url=http://www.jurisambiente.com.br/ambiente/lei3.htm|website=JurisAmbiente|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brasil, 1981"/&gt;

*Government action in maintaining the ecological balance, considering the environment as a public asset to be necessarily guaranteed and protected, in view of collective use;
* The rational use of soil, [[subsoil]], water and air;
* Planning and supervision of the use of environmental resources;
* Protection of ecosystems, the preservation of representative areas;
* Control and zoning of polluting or potentially polluting activities;
* Incentives to study and research technologies for the rational use and protection of environmental resources;
* Monitoring the state of environmental quality;
* Restoration of degraded areas;
* Protection of areas threatened with degradation;
*Environmental education at all levels of education, including community education, intended to enable them to participate actively in environmental protection

The twelve instruments of the National Environmental Policy used to promote environment protection are presented in Article&amp;nbsp;9 of the Law, and are as follows:&lt;ref name="Brasil, 1981"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Figueiredo, 1981"/&gt;
* Establishment of environmental quality standards;
* Environmental zoning;
* [[Environmental impact assessments]];
* Licensing and review of effective or potentially polluting activities;
* Incentives for production and installation of equipment and the creation or uptake of technology designed to improve environmental quality;
* The creation of special protected areas by the federal, state and municipal governments, such as environmental protection areas of significant ecological interest and extractive reserves; (Writing amended by Law No. 7804 of 18.07.89)
* The national system of environmental information;
* The Federal Technical Register of Activities and Instrument of Environmental Defense;
* Disciplinary penalties for the failure to put in place measures necessary for prevention and correction of environmental degradation.
* Establishment of the Report of Environmental Quality, to be published annually by IBAMA (Item added by Law No. 7.804 of 18.07.89)
* To ensure the provision of information relating to the environment, and ensuring the Government produces them when they are absent; (Item added by Law No. 7.804 of 18.07.89)
* The Federal Technical Registry of potentially polluting activities and/or ones that use environmental resources. (Item added by Law No. 7.804 of 18.07.89)

== National Environment System ==

Brazil is the world’s fifth-largest country and therefore ensuring that economic development takes place in a manner that is sustainable and that does not cause environmental degradation is an enormous task. To tackle this, the NEP created the National Environment System (SISNAMA), which brings together agencies and environmental institutions of the Union, the states, the municipalities and the Federal District, and whose primary purpose is to put in place the principles and norms that are imposed by the constitution.&lt;ref name="PNMA, 2004"&gt;PNMA (2004). Política Nacional do Meio Ambiente [online] Available at: http://www.jurisambiente.com.br/ambiente/politicameioambiente.shtm [Accessed 12 May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The head of this system’s structure is the National Government Council, which is the top advisory body, of the Brazilian President, for formulating the guidelines and national environmental policies. Below this comes the National Environment Council (CONAMA), which is the agency that advises the national government and deliberates over rules and standards suitable for protecting the environment, which must be followed by state and municipal governments. Following this comes the Ministry of the Environment (MMA), which plans, coordinates, supervises and controls the national environmental policy and guidelines established for the environment, performing the task of holding together the various agencies and entities that comprise the SISNAMA. Tied to the MMA is the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), which formulates, coordinates, supervises, manages, promotes and enforces the NEP and the preservation and conservation of natural resources. And finally, at the bottom of the SISNAMA structure are the local municipal and state agencies responsible for inspecting environmentally degrading activities and for implementing programs, projects and monitoring activities harmful to the environment.

==Challenges==

Brazil’s natural environment is still suffering from the effects of the aggressive policy of demographic occupation and economic development created by a geographical strategy of regional integration, enforced during the military government from 1964 to 1985.&lt;ref name="Albert, 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albert|first1=Bruce|title=Indian lands, environmental policy and military geopolitics in the development of the brazilian Amazon: The case of the Yanomami|journal=Development and Change|date=1992|volume=23|pages=35–70|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7660.1992.tb00438.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of this was to ease the population pressure in the heavily populated southeast region of Brazil, to create jobs and make use of Brazil’s vast supply of natural resources. This brought many migrants to the Amazon Basin (especially in the states of [[Rondônia]], [[Mato Grosso]], and [[Pará]]), and the infrastructure and town expansions that came with this migration has put a lot of pressure on the Amazon Forest, which has suffered significantly from deforestation.  Reversing this problem is a difficult task as it involves removing the population which has now established itself in these environments and encouraging less investment and development to occur in these places, in order to protect the natural environment. The creation of the NEP, during the military government’s rule is possibly a response to environmental [[NGO]]s’ constant pressure on not only the national government, but also on international creditors, in an effort to reduce further environmental degradation, during this period of demographic occupation.

Personal interests and economic pressures are significant barriers to successful environmental governance and removing bias from decision making is of utmost importance in order to preserve sustainability. The foundation of environmental policy making in Brazil is scientific knowledge. However, studies have suggested that, in some cases, policymakers in Brazil are inclined to use scientific evidence that supports their decisions, instead of deliberating over all the scientific knowledge available.&lt;ref name="Lahsen, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lahsen | first1 = M | year = 2009 | title = A science-policy interface in the global south: the politics of carbon sinks and science in Brazil | url = | journal = Climate Change | volume = 97 | issue = | pages = 339–372 | doi=10.1007/s10584-009-9610-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ISO 14000 standards==
An important part of establishing Brazil’s competitiveness on the world market is by being in line with the global market requirements. Many of Brazil’s chemical facilities have received [[ISO 14000]] certification and several more are close to being certified.&lt;ref name="Sissell, 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sissell|first1=Kara|title=ISO 14000 catches on in Brazil|journal=Chemical Week|date=September 1997|volume=159|issue=36|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motivation behind this is Brazil’s desire to boost its image on the international market and to increase trade with foreign partners.&lt;ref name="Sissell, 1997"/&gt; Brazil also participates on the technical committee of the ISO 14000 standards.

==Water governance==

===Marine and coastal zoning===
Environmental governance in Brazil tends to be carried out with a top-down approach, whereby the government puts in place legislation that markets have to abide to. This command-and-control approach has sometimes led to tensions between the governments, business and local communities. An example of this is the establishment of marine and coastal protected areas in Brazil. Restrictions are often imposed on [[artisanal fishery|artisanal fisheries]] without any involvement of the local communities in the decision making,&lt;ref name="Gerhardinger et al., 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Leopoldo C. Gerhardinger|author2=Eduardo A.&amp;nbsp;S. Godoy|author3=Peter J.&amp;nbsp;S. Jones|author4=Gilberto Sales|author5=Beatrice P. Ferreira|title=Marine protected dramas: the flaws of the Brazilian National System of Marine Protected Areas|journal=Environmental Management|date=April 2011|volume=47|issue=4|pages=630–643|doi=10.1007/s00267-010-9554-7|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the negative impact on the livelihood of these local communities has resulted in several conflicts.&lt;ref name="Diegues, 2008"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diegues|first1=Antonio Carlos|title=Marine protected areas and artisanal fisheries in Brazil|url=http://aquaticcommons.org/1565/1/Samudra_mon2.pdf|work=SAMUDRA Monograph|publisher=International Collective in Support of Fishworkers|date=May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ecological resilience of coastal fisheries is also said to be affected by the top-down approach of creating reserves.&lt;ref name="Lopes et al., 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lopes | first1 = P. | last2 = Silvano | first2 = R. | last3 = Begossi | first3 = A. | year = 2011 | title = Extractive and sustainable development reserves in Brazil: Resilient alternatives to fisheries? | url = | journal = Journal of Environmental Planning and Management | volume = 54 | issue = 4| pages = 421–443 | doi=10.1080/09640568.2010.508687}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of local involvement, public participation and co-management is thought to limit ecological resilience and reduce the effectiveness of the coastal reserves in protecting wildlife numbers.&lt;ref name="Lopes et al., 2011"/&gt;

===National Water Resource Policy===
Brazil has a vast supply of fresh water with some of the largest river basins in the world ([[Amazon River]], [[Paraná River]] and [[São Francisco River]]). Protecting this natural resource is not only of ecological important, but also social and economic, as many cities and populated areas of Brazil depend on them as a source of clean water. A water governance option in Brazil to manage this issue is the National Water Resource Policy (NWRP), which was established in 1997 &lt;ref name="Congresso Nacional, 1997"&gt;Congresso Nacional (1997). [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L9433.htm "Política Nacional de Recursos Hídricos"]&lt;/ref&gt; after more than a decade of congressional discussion.&lt;ref name="Ioris, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Antonio A.&amp;nbsp;R. Ioris|title=Water reforms in Brazil: Opportunities and constraints|journal=Journal of Environmental Planning and Management|date=September 2009|volume=52|issue=6|pages=813–832|doi=10.1080/09640560903083756}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NWRP aims to promote water as a resource with economic value and “creates structures for integrated governance of all water uses at the level of the hydrographic basin – river basin councils (RBCs) – that work in tandem with more traditional management such as municipal and state water and environmental agencies”.&lt;ref name="Bell et al., 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Andrew Reid Bell|author2=Maria Carmen Lemos|author3=Donald Scavia|title=Cattle, Clean Water, and Climate Change: Policy Choices for the Brazilian Agricultural Frontier|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date=October 2010|volume=44|issue=22|page=8377–84|doi=10.1021/es101729z|pmid=20961050|url=http://graham.umich.edu/scavia/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Bell-et-al.-2010.pdf|publisher=American Chemical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been argued that this policy has focused excessively on top-down strategies, such as the introduction of water pricing and environmental charges, instead of addressing public mobilisation, river restoration and [[environmental justice]].&lt;ref name="Ioris, 2009"/&gt;

==Forest governance==
Despite the predominant top-down approach of environmental governance in Brazil, there are cases where NGOs, companies, governments, and research institutions have joined together to promote ecological restoration.&lt;ref name="Calmon et al., 2011"/&gt; The Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact (AFRP) is an example of this.&lt;ref name="Rodrigues et al., 2009"&gt;Rodrigues, R., Brancalton, P. and Isernhagen, I. (2009). Pacto pela restauração da mata atlântica. São Paulo: LERF/ESALQ&lt;/ref&gt; The AFRP aims to restore 15 million hectares of the degraded and fragmented [[Atlantic Forest]] by 2050 by promoting:&lt;ref name="Calmon et al., 2011"/&gt; biodiversity conservation, and job growth through the restoration supply chain, and establishing incentives for landowners to comply with the Forest Act.&lt;ref name="Congresso Nacional, 1965"&gt;Congresso Nacional (1965). Novo Código Florestal. [online] Available at: http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/Leis/L4771.htm [Accessed 12 May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates environmental NGOs’ use of national legislation (especially environmental zoning) in order to promote environmental protection and sustainability in Brazil.

==Climate change governance==
Brazil’s large industrial and economic output, together with the fact that it hosts some of the world’s largest natural resources make it a key player in global climate change governance. In late 2009, [[Carlos Minc]], the [[Minister of Environment (Brazil)|Brazilian Minister of Environment]], announced plans to reduce [[deforestation in Brazil]] by 80% by 2020, which corresponds to a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Brazil has used its growing international influence to ensure developed countries fulfil their promises of transferring technologies and financing global development, with the aim of protecting the environment and promoting sustainability.&lt;ref name="Barros-Platiau, 2010"/&gt;

==Technology==

===Life Cycle Engineering (LCE)===
{{main|Life Cycle Engineering}}
There have been suggestions of implementing LCE in order to reduce possible environmental impacts and risks to human life, while still offering economic viability and [[social equity]].&lt;ref name="Ometto et al., 2006"/&gt; This technique uses engineering tools and concepts in order to promote greater economic sustainability. These tools include [[eco-design]] and lifecycle assessment, clean production techniques, [[reverse logistics]], disassembly, recycling, remanufacturing, reuse and [[geographical information systems]] (GIS).&lt;ref name="Ometto et al., 2006"/&gt;

===Biofuels===

[[Biofuels]] are seen as an important route to [[sustainable development]], but involve intense agricultural activity and therefore must be carefully planned and managed. Brazil is one of the world’s leading biofuel producers and importers. Brazil’s Environment Minister [[Izabella Teixeira]] claims that “biofuel production in Brazil is driven by public policies that seek to increase its production in a sustainable manner, conserving nature, creating jobs and sharing the benefits among the population”.&lt;ref name="Portal Brasil, 2010"&gt;Portal Brasil (2010). "Brazil’s biofuel integrated with environmental policy [online] Available at: http://www.brasil.gov.br/news/history/2010/10/27/brazils-biofuel-integrated-with-environmental-policy-says-environment-minister/newsitem_view?set_language=en [Accessed 12 May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The Environment Minister also claimed that “the strategy of boosting ethanol and biodiesel production is founded on a combination of two important management tools and agricultural and environmental planning: Ecological and Economic Zoning and Agro-Ecological Zoning”.&lt;ref name="Portal Brasil, 2010"/&gt; These strategies were put in place by the NEP and the case with biofuels demonstrates how the NEP instruments can be applied successfully to the economy, whilst at the same time promoting sustainability.

'''Low Dutch Station''' was established in 1780 on the middle fork of [[Beargrass Creek (Kentucky)|Beargrass Creek]] in Kentucky.  This [[station (frontier defensive structure)|station]] was settled by [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] pioneers from [[Pennsylvania]] and was also known as '''New Holland Station'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.northamericanforts.com/East/ky.html#nelson1&lt;/ref&gt; The
station was one of a group of six forts established on Beargrass Creek during this period in this area that is now a part of [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]].  The leader of the group was Hendrick Banta.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky Historical Marker no. 1848 Kentucky Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt; The group of settlers were a part of the "[[Low Dutch Company]]" and had their own bylaws, a formal charter, and accounting procedures.  The group had as its purpose the preservation of the language, culture and religion of the Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;http://nealsgenealogy.awardspace.info/shkylowd.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch traveled from a settlement near [[Harrodsburg, Kentucky|Harrodsburg]] to Low Dutch Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bar-b-k.tripod.com/id14.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719111246/http://bar-b-k.tripod.com/id14.html |archivedate=2014-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no connection between Low Dutch Station or its settlers and the nearby road known as Dutchmans Lane in [[St. Matthews, Kentucky|St. Matthews]].  The aforementioned Dutchmans Lane was originally named Deutschman's Lane, taking its name from the fact that it was the access road from Taylorsville Road to the farm owned and operated by Louis J. Hollenbach Sr., a prominent German-American businessman in early 20th-century Louisville.  Anti-German sentiment in Louisville during [[World War I]] prompted the shortening of the name from Deutschman (&lt;small&gt;lit.&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"German man") to Dutchman.

The '''Ministry of Education''' is responsible for the administration of education in Tunisia. It has its headquarters at Boulevard Bab Bnet 1030 in [[Tunis]]. As of 2015 it was directed by [[Néji Jalloul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leaders.com.tn/article/17005-lettre-ouverte-a-mr-neji-jalloul-ministre-de-l-education|title=Lettre ouverte à Mr. Néji Jalloul, ministre de l’Education|publisher=Leaders.com.tn|accessdate=7 June 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;In May 2017, the government sacked Jalloul from his position, to appoint Slim Khalbous instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.africanews.com/2017/05/01/tunisia-ministers-of-finance-and-education-sacked/|title=Tunisia: Ministers of finance and education sacked|last=AfricaNews|date=2017-05-03|website=Africanews|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{commons|Somali Civil War}}

The '''Mogadishu Line''' is the point at which foreign involvement in a [[War|conflict]] shifts from [[peacekeeping]] or [[diplomacy]] to [[combat]] operations.&lt;ref name="econrose"&gt;{{cite news|title=The crossing of the Mogadishu line.|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17804295.html|publisher=[[The Economist]] | date=13 January 1996|accessdate=27 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term often comes about in reference to the reluctance of international actors to intervene militarily in another state for [[humanitarian intervention|humanitarian reasons]], due to a fear of combat operations that have a high human cost.

== Origin of the term ==
{{see also|Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|UNOSOM II}}

The term is a reference to the external intervention in the [[Somali Civil War]], in which several opposing factions engaged in a struggle to seize control of the state. In April 1992, following calls for action by [[UN]] Secretary-General [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], the [[UN Security Council]] approved the commencement of humanitarian operations into [[Somalia]], which initially involved a small contingent of UN-approved troops ([[United Nations Operation in Somalia I|UNOSOM]]) followed in December by a US-dominated military force [[Unified Task Force|UNITAF]].

In March 1993, the [[UN Security Council]] authorized a new mission, [[United Nations Operation in Somalia II|UNOSOM II]], endowed with enforcement powers under Chapter VII of the [[United Nations|UN Charter]] to establish a secure environment throughout Somalia. However, operations turned sour following the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] on October 3, 1993, when US forces attempted to launch an attack on the Olympic Hotel in search of [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]].&lt;ref name="pbs"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ambush in Mogadishu: Chronology|publisher= [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |accessdate=27 October 2009 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ambush/etc/cron.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent combat resulted in the deaths of 18 US soldiers and a further 83 casualties. After the battle, the bodies of several US casualties of the conflict were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu by crowds of local civilians and members of Aidid's [[Somali National Alliance]].

Following the disastrous battle, pressure immediately built for a withdrawal of US troops. [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] said in the days after that "our mission from this day forward is to increase our strength, do our job, bring our soldiers out and bring them home", before announcing that troops would be withdrawn by mid-1994.&lt;ref name="pbs2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Ambush in Mogadishu: Transcript|publisher= [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |accessdate=27 October 2009 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ambush/etc/script.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
The concept of the Mogadishu Line became ingrained in post-[[Cold War]] [[international relations]] discourse. Fear of a repeat of the events in Somalia shaped US policy in subsequent years, with many commentators identifying the graphic consequences of the Battle of Mogadishu as the key reason behind the US's failure to intervene in later conflicts such as the [[Rwandan Genocide]] of 1994.&lt;ref name="keane"&gt;{{cite news |first=Fergal |last=Keane |authorlink=Fergal Keane |coauthors= |title=Good news: the United States has decided to cross the 'Mogadishu line' |publisher= [[The Economist]] |date= 5 July 2003 |accessdate=21 July 2009 |quote= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/good-news-the-united-states-has-decided-to-cross-the-mogadishu-line-585821.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the US's former deputy special envoy to Somalia, Walter Clarke: "The ghosts of Somalia continue to haunt US policy. Our lack of response in Rwanda was a fear of getting involved in something like a Somalia all over again."&lt;ref name="pbs2" /&gt;

Clinton also refused to mobilize US ground troops in fighting the [[Army of Republika Srpska|Bosnian Serb Army]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1995 and the Yugoslav Army in the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (specifically, the then-province of [[Kosovo]]) in 1999.

In the 1990s, General [[Michael Rose (British Army officer)|Michael Rose]], head of the [[United Nations Protection Force]], insisted that the United Nations would never "cross the Mogadishu Line".&lt;ref name="econrose" /&gt; However, Rose's replacement, [[Rupert Smith]], came to the conclusion that UNPROFOR's humanitarian mandate was insufficient.

In 2003, Keane opined that changes in U.S. policy toward [[Liberia]] suggested that the Mogadishu Line had been "erased."&lt;ref name="keane" /&gt;

The '''National Democratic Party''' was a minor party in the [[Irish Free State]] representing small farming interests.

The [[Farmers' Party (Ireland)|Farmers' Party]] was a significant force in early 1920s politics in Ireland, but it was associated with middle-class farmers with larger holdings.&lt;ref name="coakley"&gt;John Coakley, "Minor Parties in Irish Political Life, 1922-1989", ''The Economic and Social Review'', vol.21, no.3, pp.269-297&lt;/ref&gt;  Small-scale farmers who felt that the Farmers' Party did not represent them founded the National Democratic Party early in 1923, aiming to also attract support from poor labourers and other individuals in rural areas.&lt;ref name="barberis"&gt;Peter Barberis et al, ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations'', p.234&lt;/ref&gt;

The party announced that it would stand fifteen candidates at the [[Irish general election, 1923|1923 general election]],&lt;ref&gt;"Latest list of candidates", ''[[Irish Times]]'', 14 August 1923&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately, it stood only four candidates:&lt;ref name="coakley" /&gt; Joseph O'Mahony in [[Cork West (Dáil constituency)|Cork West]], Joseph Delaney and [[Patrick Belton]] in [[Laois–Offaly (Dáil constituency)|Laois–Offaly]], and Seán O'Farrell in [[Longford–Westmeath (Dáil constituency)|Longford–Westmeath]].&lt;ref&gt;"General election - full list of nominations", ''[[Irish Times]]'', 20 August 1923&lt;/ref&gt;  They took only 4,966 votes between them, and none were elected.&lt;ref name="coakley" /&gt;  The party disbanded soon after the election.&lt;ref name="barberis" /&gt;

The '''National Forest Management Act (NFMA) of 1976''' (P.L. 94-588) is a [[United States federal law]] that is the primary [[statute]] governing the administration of [[United States National Forest|national forest]]s and was an [[law|amendment]] to the [[Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974]], which called for the management of [[renewable resource]]s on national forest lands.  The law was a response to lawsuits involving various practices in the national forest, including timber harvesting.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Timber Wars|url=http://www.justice.gov/enrd/timber-wars|publisher=United States Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zieske v Butz (Alaska, US District Court, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Zieske v Butz was the lawsuit brought by members of the Pt Baker Association on Prince of Wales Island against the US Forest Service's first environmental impact statement. The suit halted logging on the NW tip of the island which consisted of 400,000 acres and resulted in a call by the timber industry for Congressional action to undo the lawsuit.

== Background ==

The main objectives of NFMA are to require the U.S. Forest Service to develop plans for national forests, set standards for timber sales, and create policies to regulate timber harvesting. The purpose of these objectives is to protect national forests from permanent damages from excessive logging and clear cutting. Congress requires the Forest Service, in conjunction with other applicable agencies, to thoroughly assess, research, and plan for the nation's renewable resource use, the current demand, anticipated demands, and environmental and economic impacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/emc/nfma/includes/law.html|title=National Forest Management Act Of 1976|last=Liu|first=Karen|date=1998|website=www.fs.fed.us|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NFMA changed forest planning by obliging the [[United States Forest Service]] to use a systematic and interdisciplinary approach to resource management.  It also provided for public involvement in preparing and revising forest plans.  Also, NFMA established and expanded several Forest Service trust funds and special accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5425470.pptx|title=Agency Mission and Habitat Management|last=Logan|first=Brian|date=|website=U.S. Department of Agriculture|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It expanded upon the land and resource management plans (L/RMPs) outlined in the  [[Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974]] (RPA), and started by requiring the Forest Service to do an inventory of all its lands, followed by a zoning process to see what uses land was best suited for - dubbed the "suitability determination."&lt;ref name="wildlifelaw website"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://wildlifelaw.unm.edu/fedbook/nfma.html|title= National Forest Management Act of 1976|accessdate= 2009-01-18|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100612053009/http://wildlifelaw.unm.edu/fedbook/nfma.html|archivedate= 2010-06-12|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These plans required alternative land management options to be presented, each of which have potential resource outputs (timber, range, mining, recreation) as well as [[socio-economic]] effects on local communities. The Forest Service, in cooperation with the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA), contributed considerable resources to the creation of [[FORPLAN]] (a [[linear programming]] model used to estimate the land management resource outputs) and [[IMPLAN]] to estimate the economic effects of these outputs on local communities.&lt;ref name="gov website"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.economics.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/implan/implanmodel.html|title= IMPLAN Model|accessdate= 2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At the time NFMA was written, there were conflicting interests in regards to proper forest management.  The major player of national forest management at the time was the timber industry.  In a post [[World War II]] economy, the demand for timber skyrocketed with the housing boom and people were recreating on public lands more than ever before.  Visitors to national parks rose from 50 million in 1950 to 72 million in 1960.  The [[Sierra Club]] and other conservation groups were also fighting for preservation of natural landscapes.  The [[Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960]] made it clear that the Forest Service had to manage for non-timber values, like recreation, range, watershed, wildlife and fishery purposes, but it was not until NFMA that these uses were embodied by the forest planning process.&lt;ref&gt;''History of National Forest Conflicts''. The Thoreau Institute. http://www.ti.org/2chistory.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== The NFMA Planning Process ==

The 1982 NFMA Planning Regulations describe a planning process designed to integrate the many interests concerning the forest:

#  Identify issues, concerns, and opportunities (ICOs). State and local agency officials, as well as the public, collaborate to identify current issues as well as possible future issues and concerns.  The goal of the planning process is to improve the forest to better serve the public.
#   Develop planning criteria.  Three main criteria are used for management actions: public policy criteria or the policy outlined in regulatory and statutory guidelines, process criteria or the accepted standard of data analysis, and decision criteria or the weight assigned to each management action.
#   Collect data and information necessary to address ICOs. Ensure that data collection meets the process criteria standards.  Also include data for a 'no action' alternative to use as a control during alternative comparison.
#   Analyze the management situation (AMS).  Group land into strata of similar physical features, such as vegetation, wildlife or soil type, to analyze the effects of management actions.
#   Formulate a broad range of alternatives including a 'no action' alternative.
#   Estimate the effects of each alternative on the environment, the economy, and society.
#   Evaluate alternatives by comparing how well each resolves the ICOs.  Evaluate each alternative using the planning criteria outlined in step 2.
#   Select a preferred alternative.  This is the proposed forest plan.  Document the proposal and justify the selection.  Explain why other alternatives were not chosen that may have a higher net present value or are more environmentally preferable.  Prepare a Record of Decision (ROD) of the plan.
#   Implement the plan by updating all uses of the forest into conformity of the forest plan.  Make the proper budget requests for full implementation.
#   Monitor and evaluate the plan by comparing the actual biological effects of the plan to the projections.  Make adjustments where necessary.&lt;ref&gt;36 C.F.R. 219.12; Loomis, John B. ''Integrated Public Lands Management 2nd Ed''. New York: Columbia University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timeline of NFMA ==
According to the National Forest Service, some of the key events in implementation of the act were the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/main/planningrule/history|title=Planning Rule - History of Forest Planning|website=www.fs.usda.gov|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;1975  Zieske v Butz (D. Alaska, 1975) was the political trigger for Congressional Action&lt;/ref&gt;

1976 - NFMA was enacted.

1979 - First planning regulations established.

1982 - Revised NFMA planning regulations established.

1989 - Comprehensive review conducted on land management of the Forest Service.

1993 - First revision of forest plan conducted.

1997 - A 13-member Committee of Scientists met to analyze and recommend methods for the Forest Service to improve management of national forests and grasslands. Report was released in 1999.

2000 - The 2000 Planning Rule published. The 2000 Planning Rule caused major backlash from the public. A review was conducted by the Department of Agriculture and found that the rule had considerable flaws.

2002 - Forest Service publishes the 2002 Proposed Planning Rule.

2004 - The Forest Service published the Interpretive Rule. The Interpretive Rule clarifies to the public that while a new rule is formulated, the procedures from the 1982 rule are still applicable to forest plans.

2005 - The 2005 Planning Rule was published.

2008 - The 2008 Planning Rule and an EIS on the rule was published.

2009 - The 2008 Planning Rule was overturned by the U.S. District Court for Northern California. The Forest Service was to return to the 2000 rule while new rules are formulated.

2012 - The 2012 Planning Rule was published. The process of formulating this Planning Rule began in 2009.

== Legal Battles ==

NFMA has spawned lawsuits regarding the degree of involvement required by both the Forest Service and the public. NFMA does not have a citizen suit provision. Judicial review must fall under the Administrative Procedure Act. Judicial review under NFMA can happen in two common ways: 1) challenges over various forest plans as violating NFMA or 2) judicial review over specific actions or occurrences such as timber sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuholske|first=Jack|year=1998|title=The National Forest Management Act: Judicial Interpretation of a Substantive Environmental Statute|url=http://scholarship.law.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1312&amp;context=plrlr|journal=Public Land and Resources Law Review|volume=15|pages=54–88|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stein v Barton'''

In 1990, the Alaska District Court held that the US Forest Service's plan for Prince of Wales Island was arbitrary and capricious for rejecting 100 foot buffer strips on both sides of salmon streams when clearcutting.&lt;ref&gt;740 F. Supp 743 (D. Alaska, 1990) http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/740/743/1952466/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Seattle Audubon Society v. Evans'''''

Under statute 16 U.S.C. 1604(h) of NFMA, the Forest Service is required to develop plans with independent scientists that considers biodiversity. The regulation required that planning "provide for diversity of plant and animal communities based on the suitability and capability of the specific land area in order to meet overall multiple-use objectives, and within the multiple-use objectives of a land management plan adopted pursuant to this section, provide, where appropriate, to the degree practicable, for steps to be taken to preserve the diversity of tree species similar to that existing in the region controlled by the plan." This regulation became known as the "viability regulation."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/enrd/spotted-owl-litigation|title=The Spotted Owl Litigation {{!}} ENRD {{!}} Department of Justice|website=www.justice.gov|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The viability regulation required that habitat of fish and wildlife are managed to hold a healthy population of native species and some "desired" non-native species. Indicator species were chosen for monitoring to ensure habitat conditions are stable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Northern Spotted Owl was designated an indicator species in the old growth forests in the Pacific Northwest. In this region, environmental preservation efforts were thoroughly involved throughout the community yet timber harvesting was still a key economic dependency. In 1991, the ''Seattle Audubon Society v. Evans'' case maintained that the Forest Service must still comply with NFMA requirements even though the Northern Spotted Owl had been listed "threatened" under [[Endangered Species Act]] (ESA). The Forest Service claimed that once the owls became part of the Endangered Species Act's duties, it was then relieved of its own duties to maintain the viability of its population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://elr.info/litigation/%5Bfield_article_volume-raw%5D/20372/seattle-audubon-socy-v-evans|title=Seattle Audubon Soc'y v. Evans {{!}} Environmental Law Reporter|date=2011-10-28|website=elr.info|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ohio Forestry Association v. Sierra Club'''''

The [[Sierra Club]] claimed that the logging practices allowed in the Wayne National Forest in Southeast Ohio were unlawful under NFMA because the Act requires ongoing input and management from the Forest Service. According to the Sierra Club, plan in the Wayne National Forest permitted too much logging and clearcutting. The Court rejected the claims of the Sierra Club and stated the Forest Service is not an agency required to perform ongoing action or involvement in the forest plans. Justice Breyer concluded that the "controversy is not yet ripe for judicial review."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Breyer|title=Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc. v. Sierra Club|date=1998|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/97-16.ZO.html|language=en-us|accessdate=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sierra Club v. Marita, 1995'''''

The Forest Service issued two land and resource management plans for national forests in Wisconsin that both involved timber harvest.  To monitor ecosystem health, the Forest Service chose a handful of management indicator species as proxies, but the Sierra Club argued that a mosaic-like logging of the national forests would not provide the wildlife corridor necessary to ensure appropriate biodiversity of those species or any others.  The Sierra Club attacked the Forest Service's science behind their L/RMP, calling it "junk science".  Ultimately, the court ruled in favor of agency discretion despite finding that the Forest Service used questionable science, though not to the degree that their decision could be considered arbitrary and capricious under the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] (APA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.invispress.com/law/natural/marita.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Big Thorne Project'''''

Environmental groups claimed that the Forest Service violated National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) and NFMA, and the 2008 Amended Tongass National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan. The Big Thorne Project involved allowance of logging of old growth forests and construction of new roads in the Tongass National Forest. The court rejected claims from environmental groups, saying that the Forest Service's assessments and actions were reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://elr.info/litigation/45/20056/big-thorne-project|title=Big Thorne Project {{!}} Environmental Law Reporter|date=2012-03-19|website=elr.info|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Normandy Youth Club–The N-Factor''' was founded in the [[United Kingdom]] in July 2008, and launched in January 2009 to help combat the increasing incidents of youth crime in [[Normandy, Surrey|Normandy]], [[Surrey, England|Surrey]] and its surrounding hamlets.

==History==
After a gap of not having an area youth club for over two decades Mrs Maria Angel [[MBE]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-year-honours-list-2018-department-for-education.&lt;/ref&gt;, BA (Hons) Bus &amp; Mgt, PGCE, QTLS, FCMI, a School and Sixth Form teacher, recognised the lack of out of school hours youth leisure facilities within the parish of [[Normandy, Surrey]].&lt;ref name="Mum"/&gt; She founded the "Normandy Youth Club–The N-Factor" to help combat the increasing incidents of youth crime in the community.&lt;ref name="Mum"&gt;[http://img.tesco.com/todayattesco/lifestyle_and_fashion/mum_of_the_year_maria_angel.shtml ''Mum of the Year'']; article at [[Tesco]] Magazine on-line; retrieved January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The group is based out of Normandy Village Hall&lt;ref&gt;

==Aims, Objectives &amp; Initiatives==
The youth club encourages all children and young people to become more socially included within the rural community of Normandy.&lt;ref name="Mum"/&gt; The organization is a voluntary, rural community youth club that does culturally sensitive youth work and has concentrated its efforts in targeting young people from disadvantaged and marginalised communities in Normandy and its surrounding hamlets, including those from the [[minority group]] communities (such as [[Names of the Romani people#Gypsy and Gipsy|Gypsy]], [[Irish Travellers]] and [[Showman]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surreyhighsheriff.org/Launch-of-The-N-Factor.asp ''The Surrey High Sheriff Youth Award 2009 and 2010''].&lt;/ref&gt; It provides [[NEET|Not in Employment Education or Training]] (NEET) support and [[mentorship]] programmes for volunteer supervisors and members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surreyyouthfocus.org.uk/userfiles/Issue%20No%2053.pdf ''Userfiles'']; Surrey Youth Focus on-line; retrieved January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative-based youth club programmes have included adopting the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC) 'Walk a mile in my shoes' initiative, which embraces the principles of the 'Rights to Dignity and Respect'. The Normandy Youth Club–The N-Factor creative art workshops, provide a platform to interpret and express those principles through art, film and photography. Opportunities to showcase the children and young people's talents, have been organised through Summer art and photographic competitions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surreycommunity.info/normandypc/village/news-and-views/summer-photographic-competitio/ ''Photo Competition'']; Surrey Community Information; on-line; retrieved January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; thereby positively raising the profile of and engaging its young members with the rest of the community.&lt;ref name="Mum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surreylife.co.uk/people/charity/surrey_life_community_heroes_2014_who_really_makes_a_difference_to_life_in_your_town_or_village_1_3260292/ ''Surrey Life Community Heroes 2011'']; Great British Life article; retrieved January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
The Normandy Youth Club–The N-Factor has been recognised for its work towards "[[community cohesion]]," both locally and nationally. The youth club has also received many national community awards and was recognised by the UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his wife [[Sarah Jane Brown|Sarah]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://resources.cohesioninstitute.org.uk/GoodPractice/Projects/Project/Default.aspx?recordId=334 Good Practice Projects] at cohesion institute; retrieved 10 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/s/2053193_local_heroes_honoured_at_police_awards_ceremony/ ''Local Heroes Honored'']; [[Surrey Advertiser]] Get Surrey Group news on-line; retrieved January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYC"&gt;

'''Official Secretary to the Governor''' or '''Official Secretary to the Governor-General''' is an office in the [[Government Houses of the British Empire and Commonwealth|Government House]] in various [[British overseas territory|British overseas territories]] and [[Commonwealth realm]]s. A similar office may be retained in some of the former British territories. In some countries or territories the titles '''Private Secretary''', '''Personal Secretary''' or simply '''Secretary''' are used instead of ''Official Secretary''. The Official Secretary is usually the general manager of the Government House, although he or she may have additional functions. In [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]], e.g., the Official Secretary is a [[civil service]] officer from the Prime Minister's [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (New Zealand)|Department]] or [[Office of the Prime Minister (Canada)|Office]], but in [[Australia]], the Official Secretary has become a position independent from the government.

'''''On the Job''''' (abbreviated as '''''OTJ''''') is a 2013 Philippine [[neo-noir]] [[crime thriller]] film written and directed by [[Erik Matti]]. It stars [[Joel Torre]], [[Gerald Anderson]], [[Piolo Pascual]] and [[Joey Marquez]]. In the story, two [[contract killing]] prisoners (Torre and Anderson) are temporarily released from jail to carry out political executions in a corrupt justice system, whereas two law enforcers (Pascual and Marquez) are tasked with investigating the drug-related murder case, connected to the prison gun-for-hire business. [[Michael de Mesa]], [[Leo Martinez]], [[Vivian Velez]], [[Angel Aquino]], [[Shaina Magdayao]] and [[Rayver Cruz]] play supporting roles.

The inspiration for ''On the Job'' came from a [[Viva Films]] crew member who claimed to have been temporarily released from prison to perform contract killings before being reincarcerated. Matti incorporated this experience into a screenplay he co-wrote with [[Michiko Yamamoto (screenwriter)|Michiko Yamamoto]]. In 2010, [[Star Cinema]] initially declined to produce the film as they deemed it too violent compared to their usual [[romantic comedy]] projects, but by 2012, agreed to co-produce under Matti's [[independent film]] company, [[Reality Entertainment]]. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Manila]] and lasted thirty-three days, on a production budget of [[Philippine peso|₱]]47 million (about US$1.1 million).

''On the Job'' was shown in the [[Directors' Fortnight]] at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]] on May 24, where it received praise and a [[standing ovation]]. The film opened in the Philippines on August 28 by Star Cinema, and in North America on September 27 by Well Go USA Entertainment, to very positive reviews from both local and international critics. An American [[remake]] directed by Icelandic filmmaker [[Baltasar Kormákur]] was confirmed in June 2013, and principal photography on a [[miniseries]] [[sequel]] directed by Matti is underway as of July 2017.

In a [[Philippines]] rife with corruption and poverty, [[Contract killing|hitmen]] Mario and Daniel are prisoners who are frequently released and paid to perform hits for their boss, Thelma. Mario spends his earnings on his law school tuition for his daughter Tina, and for his estranged wife, Lulette. Daniel, the younger and most reckless partner, pays remittances to his family and spends the rest on goods and privileges inside prison. Daniel has come to see Mario as a mentor and [[father figure]]. After the pair murder [[drug lord]] Tiu and return to prison, Tiu's murder case is assigned to [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|NBI]] Agent Francis Coronel through the agent's father-in-law, Congressman Manrique. Coronel's father, also a police officer, died amid rumors of corruption. When Coronel and his partner Bernabe arrive at the local precinct, they clash with [[Philippine National Police|PNP]] Sergeant Joaquin Acosta, a twenty-year veteran who believes the case was taken from him for political reasons.

Mario and Daniel next carry out a hit on a woman named Linda. Upon hearing of her death, Linda's husband, Pol, immediately calls Acosta. Pol reveals that Tiu's murder is one of several assassinations ordered by Manrique's close friend General Pacheco, a military officer campaigning for public office in the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]]. Pacheco runs a gun-for-hire operation using prisoners, and kills others involved in the business in order to protect his campaign. Acosta agrees to protect Pol and heads to the station, where he finds Coronel and Bernabe. While the two confront Acosta, Daniel shoots Pol, but his pistol [[Firearm malfunction|jams]] before he can deliver the fatal shot. The three officers converge on them, forcing Daniel and Mario to flee. Daniel shoots a hospital janitor to create a distraction, allowing Mario to kill Pol. The two then split up to escape; Coronel and Bernabe chase Daniel, and Acosta pursues Mario. During the chase, Bernabe is shot, and Mario sprains his ankle.

Coronel confronts Manrique during a campaign meeting, and explains that he intends to arrest Pacheco, but Manrique warns Coronel that Pacheco's indictment will cause their downfall, as Manrique is one of Pacheco's clients. Acosta relays Mario's [[Facial composite|composite sketch]] to the police to be broadcast on television. Frustrated of his father-in-law's involvement with Pacheco, Coronel decides to work with Acosta, who informs him that his father was not corrupt, but was in fact killed while trying to expose corruption{{em dash}}Acosta himself was demoted for his part in working to weed out corruption. When Coronel discovers Mario's identity, he visits Lulette, who is with her lover, Boy. Coronel informs Acosta of Lulette's affair, and he attempts to use it as leverage while interrogating Mario. He is unsuccessful, but Mario later expresses to Daniel a sense of betrayal by his family's abandonment.

Tiu's father tells Acosta and Coronel that he can provide them with the evidence they need to arrest Pacheco. On the way, though, Coronel abandons Acosta to visit Pacheco, who admits that he killed Coronel's father. Coronel secretly records a conversation between Pacheco and his men regarding the murder of Tiu's father.

The next day, Coronel informs his wife Nicky of his intention to take down Pacheco, incriminating Manrique in the process. Daniel murders Coronel in front of police headquarters. Enraged, Acosta attacks Manrique's and Pacheco's security detail, resulting in a brief shootout, until Pacheco orders them to cease fire. On the day Mario is to be released from prison, he realizes that he has no reason to leave, as his family no longer wants to have anything to do with him, and he stabs Daniel to death in order to remain incarcerated. Coronel's death is mourned by many, including Nicky. Acosta is discharged and investigated for Coronel's murder. Mario visits home, kills Boy in front of his family, and returns to prison.

Sometime later, a recovered Bernabe looks through Coronel's possessions and finds the cell phone that Coronel used to secretly record the incriminating conversation between Manrique and Pacheco. Bernabe requisitions the phone as evidence.

The director of ''On the Job'', [[Erik Matti]], took inspiration from a [[chauffeur|service driver]] of [[Viva Films]] who claimed to have been temporarily released from prison to perform contract killings before being reincarcerated.&lt;ref name="eastern"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heskins |first1=Andrew |title=Erik Matti: getting the job done |url=http://www.easternkicks.com/features/erik-matti-getting-the-job-done |accessdate=May 24, 2017 |publisher=EasternKicks.com |date=June 4, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602232942/http://www.easternkicks.com/features/erik-matti-getting-the-job-done |archivedate=June 2, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matti shelved this idea until he ended his hiatus from directing. In 2009, he submitted a [[short film]] he directed entitled ''The Arrival'' and an eight-minute trailer of ''On the Job'', featuring [[Joel Torre]], to [[film festival]]s in an attempt to [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] the project.&lt;ref name="eastern" /&gt; Both entries were met with critical acclaim,&lt;ref name="esquire"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gomez |first1=Jerome |title=The Long History Behind Erik Matti's Barrier-Breaking ''On The Job'' |url=http://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/arts-and-entertainment/erik-matti-on-the-job-a1549-20170421-lfrm7 |accessdate=May 24, 2017 |work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |location=Philippines |date=August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170604114102/http://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/arts-and-entertainment/erik-matti-on-the-job-a1549-20170421-lfrm7|archivedate=June 4, 2017 |issn=2243-8459}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the trailer piqued the interest of [[Twitch Film]] editor Todd Brown, who inquired if the project had entered production. When Matti told him that the film did not yet have a screenplay, Brown encouraged him to write it while he looked for investors for financing.&lt;ref name="esquire" /&gt; On the script's ninth revision, screenwriter [[Michiko Yamamoto (screenwriter)|Michiko Yamamoto]] came on board to help finalize the remainder of the draft.&lt;ref name="esquire" /&gt; Four uncredited consultants were also hired to develop details in the story.&lt;ref name="Budget" /&gt;

During the writing process, and even after the final draft was complete, Brown was unable to attract financiers; some felt the story was too nontraditional for Philippine cinema or too large a risk for overseas market.&lt;ref name=eastern /&gt;&lt;ref name="esquire" /&gt; [[Star Cinema]], the largest production company in the Philippines, refused to make the film in 2010, as it was too violent and intense compared to their usual [[romantic comedy]] projects.&lt;ref name="esquire" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yang"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yang |first1=Tatin |title=Attamovie!—How ''On The Job'' all-in gamble paid off |url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/124059/attamovie-how-on-the-job-all-in-gamble-paid-off/ |accessdate=July 4, 2017 |newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=September 7, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014142039/http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/124059/attamovie-how-on-the-job-all-in-gamble-paid-off |archivedate=October 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matti offered the project to two of Star Cinema's talents, who also declined due to its gore and violence.&lt;ref name="eastern" /&gt;&lt;ref name="esquire" /&gt; The project was once again put on hold as Matti entered the [[post-production]] stage of his [[horror fantasy]] film ''[[Tiktik: The Aswang Chronicles]]'' (2012). At this time, he was contacted by an agent of Star Cinema requesting the revised script; three days later, the studio agreed to fund the film.&lt;ref name="esquire" /&gt;

[[Reality Entertainment]], an [[independent film]] company Matti co-founded, co-produced ''On the Job'' with Star Cinema. Dondon Monteverde, co-founder of Reality Entertainment, said that many studios were impressed by the script but were reluctant to finance an expensive [[action film]].&lt;ref name="yang" /&gt; The production team considered reducing the film's budget, but decided not to, hoping to shift away from making [[low-budget films]]; Monteverde recalled arguing that it was "really time to do something big-budget and showcase it, rather than making something small and claiming budgetary restrictions. This time we didn't give ourselves any excuses. We went all the way".&lt;ref name="yang" /&gt; The production cost for the film amounted to [[Philippine peso|₱]]47 million&lt;ref name="Budget" /&gt; (about [[United States Dollar|US$]]1.1 million in 2013).{{efn|name=fn1|The exchange rate in 2013 was 42.446 Philippine peso (₱) per 1 US dollar (US$), making ₱47 million worth about US$1.107 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williamson|first1=Samuel H.|title=Exchange Rates Between the United States Dollar and Forty-one Currencies|url=https://www.measuringworth.com/datasets/exchangeglobal/result.php?year_source=2013&amp;year_result=2016&amp;countryE%5B%5D=Philippines|publisher=MeasuringWorth|accessdate=September 7, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910220812/https://www.measuringworth.com/datasets/exchangeglobal/result.php?year_source=2013&amp;year_result=2016&amp;countryE%5B%5D=Philippines|archivedate=September 10, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Joel Torre, who portrays Mario "Tatang" Maghari in the film, had already been cast before Matti's script revision; [[Angel Aquino]] plays his wife Lulette and [[Empress Schuck]] portrays his daughter Tina.&lt;ref name="prodnotes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rave" /&gt; Of the role, Torre said, "[Mario] stuck with me, fought for me.

After a discussion between Pascual and Anderson about the film, Anderson signed on for the role. Anderson had only two weeks to film his scenes as he was occupied with a [[soap opera]] shoot at the time.&lt;ref name="esquire" /&gt; Dawn Jimenez appeared in her acting debut as Anderson's girlfriend Diane.&lt;ref name="prodnotes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="league" /&gt;

The role of Sergeant Joaquin Acosta was to be played by [[Richard Gomez]], but he chose instead to pursue a political career in [[Ormoc]].&lt;ref name="esquire" /&gt;&lt;ref name="joey"&gt;{{cite news|title=How comedian Joey Marquez was cast for ''OTJ'' |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/08/22/13/how-comedian-joey-marquez-was-cast-otj |accessdate=May 25, 2017 |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date=August 23, 2013 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223141725/http://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/08/22/13/how-comedian-joey-marquez-was-cast-otj|archivedate=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matti later cast [[Joey Marquez]]; although Marquez was seen primarily as a comedian, Matti believed he would be able to portray a simultaneously charismatic and obnoxious character.&lt;ref name="joey" /&gt; The cast also features [[Leo Martinez]] as General Pacheco, [[Lito Pimentel]] as Pol, [[William Martinez (actor)|William Martinez]] as Rex, [[Vivian Velez]] as Thelma, and [[Rayver Cruz]] as Bernabe.&lt;ref name="prodnotes" /&gt;

Richard V. Somes was both the [[production designer]] and [[stage combat|action choreographer]] of ''On the Job''.&lt;ref name="Variety review" /&gt; To prepare for the prison scenes, the production crew built a set in an abandoned building in [[Marikina]], hiring two hundred [[Extra (acting)|extras]] to play convicts.&lt;ref name="esquire" /&gt; [[Principal photography]] lasted thirty-three days, on location in multiple [[Manila]] areas, including [[Manila City Hall]], a [[Manila Light Rail Transit System|Light Rail]] train station, and [[Caloocan]].&lt;ref name="rogue"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jaucian |first1=Don |title=The Game Changer |url=https://roguemagazine.squarespace.com/features/on-the-job |accessdate=May 25, 2017 |work=Rogue Magazine |date=June 16, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170604114102/https://roguemagazine.squarespace.com/features/on-the-job|archivedate=June 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The opening scenes were shot during the annual [[Basaan Festival]] in [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]].&lt;ref name="pepreview" /&gt; Filming was stretched across over seventy locations,&lt;ref name="esquire" /&gt; and the crew sometimes shot numerous areas in a given day.&lt;ref name="rogue" /&gt; On choosing Manila as a key location for the film, Matti said:

{{blockquote|text=This is a Manila movie. We wanted to show as much of the cross section of Manila as we could. This is, I think, the most ambitious attempt at putting together as much variety [in a local film] in terms of look and feel.&lt;ref name="esquire" /&gt;}}

Francis Ricardo Buhay III served as the [[cinematographer]], who had also worked on Matti's films ''Tiktik'' and ''Rigodon'' (2013).&lt;ref name="gmareview" /&gt; Rather than setting up and changing lights for certain shots, Buhay captured the film using the [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|Red]] EPIC camera;&lt;ref name="rogue" /&gt; with the Red EPIC's available lighting function, including the ability to light an entire set, the film was styled as a [[neo-noir|modern noir]] without appearing low-budget.&lt;ref name="esquire" /&gt;

=== Music ===
Erwin Romulo, the editor-in-chief for the Philippine edition of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' until 2013, served as the musical director of ''On the Job''.&lt;ref name="erwin"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Romulo |first1=Erwin |title=The truth behind ''On the Job'' |url=http://www.philstar.com/young-star/2013/09/06/1175681/truth-behind-job |accessdate=May 26, 2017 |newspaper=The Philippine Star |date=September 6, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025150613/http://www.philstar.com/young-star/2013/09/06/1175681/truth-behind-job |archivedate=October 25, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cruz |first1=Jonty |title=The unedited Erwin Romulo |url=http://www.philstar.com/sunday-life/2015/12/13/1531881/unedited-erwin-romulo |accessdate=May 26, 2017 |newspaper=The Philippine Star |date=December 13, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529161243/http://www.philstar.com/sunday-life/2015/12/13/1531881/unedited-erwin-romulo |archivedate=May 29, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At their first meeting, Matti hired Romulo as the [[music supervisor]], but Romulo's role transformed as he wanted to produce most of the tracks he had planned for the film. Romulo employed lesser-known [[Music of the Philippines#Original Pilipino music|original Pilipino music]] tracks from otherwise prominent Filipino musicians, such as "Maskara" and "Pinoy Blues" by the [[Juan de la Cruz Band]]. He approached [[Dong Abay]] and [[Radioactive Sago Project]] bassist Francis de Veyra to perform the two songs, arranged by [[Armi Millare]]. Additional tracks were performed by [[Ely Buendia]], the late [[FrancisM]], and the local band Bent Lynchpin. One member of Bent Lynchpin, Fred Sandoval, was also the film's music editor.&lt;ref name="erwin" /&gt;

According to Romulo, the tracks are "local [[hip hop music|hip hop]]" heavily influenced by [[DJ Shadow]]'s album ''[[Endtroducing.....]]''. He also credited [[film score]]s composed by [[Lalo Schifrin]], and director [[Ishmael Bernal]]'s longtime composer Vanishing Tribe as major influences for the soundtrack.&lt;ref name="erwin" /&gt;

=== Sequel ===
In June 2016, a [[sequel]] [[miniseries]] was announced. Matti hinted that its focus will be on "a protagonist that is not necessarily good. But there's a bigger evil above them and you start rooting for the bad guy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''On the Job'' film turns into mini-series|url=http://www.philstar.com:8080/entertainment/2016/06/04/1590013/job-film-turns-mini-series|accessdate=July 30, 2017|newspaper=The Philippine Star|date=June 4, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605163148/http://www.philstar.com:8080/entertainment/2016/06/04/1590013/job-film-turns-mini-series|archivedate=June 5, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six-part series will be a co-production between streaming service [[HOOQ]], [[Globe Telecom]]'s Globe Studios, and Matti's Reality Entertainment; it will be exclusively available on HOOQ. Directed by Matti himself, the ensemble cast will feature Leo Martinez reprising his film role, [[Arjo Atayde]], Teroy Guzman, [[Bela Padilla]], [[Neil Ryan Sese]], [[Dominic Ochoa]], Smokey Manaloto, Jake Macapagal, [[Ria Atayde]], and [[Christopher de Leon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HOOQ, Globe Studios reveal star-studded cast of ''OTJ: The Series'' |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/hooq-globe-studios-reveal-star-studded-cast-otj-series/296662/ |accessdate=May 25, 2017 |newspaper=[[The Manila Times]] |date=November 15, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116143614/http://www.manilatimes.net/hooq-globe-studios-reveal-star-studded-cast-otj-series/296662/ |archivedate=November 16, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=''On The Job: The Series'': Star-studded cast unveiled! |url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151686-on-the-job-the-series-miniseries-hooq-cast-reveal |accessdate=May 25, 2017 |publisher=Rappler |date=November 8, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111180618/http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/151686-on-the-job-the-series-miniseries-hooq-cast-reveal |archivedate=November 11, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the project, Matti said:

{{blockquote|text=We wanted to bring back many (of the original characters) into the story but since we jumped off to another topic, another institution, which is media, we wanted to refresh the cast of characters. What we enjoyed in the first movie is how we put together also the kind of casting that we got, (meaning) all of those actors we admired. We wanted to also have the same kind of feel. We brought a lot of actors that could possibly do new and refreshing kind of roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Valeza |first1=Karen |title=''On The Job'' now a mini-series |url=http://entertainment.mb.com.ph/2016/11/16/on-the-job-now-a-mini-series/ |accessdate=June 19, 2017 |newspaper=[[Manila Bulletin]] |date=December 7, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117150257/http://entertainment.mb.com.ph/2016/11/16/on-the-job-now-a-mini-series/ |archivedate=November 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As of July 2017, principal photography on the sequel is underway. Simultaneously, HOOQ opened a [[Casting (performing arts)|casting call]] website for those wanting to appear in the series.

'''Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Site Act of 1991''', '''Public Law 102-304''', is a federal law, enacted on June 23, 1992, that established the [[Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park|Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Site.]] Located in the lower [[Rio Grande]] Valley, north of modern [[Brownsville, Texas]], the site was the location of the first battle of the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–1848), on May 8, 1846. At the time of its establishment in 1992, Palo Alto was the first unit of the [[National Park Service]] to commemorate the Mexican–American War, a controversial conflict that ended with the American occupation of [[Mexico City]] and the cessation to the United States of Mexican lands in modern [[California]] and [[New Mexico]]. Palo alto is also known for tu ama cooking

==Background==

The [[Battle of Palo Alto]], fought on May 8, 1846, near modern [[Brownsville, Texas]], was the first battle of the [[Mexican–American War]]. On April 30, 1846, Mexican federal troops under the command of General [[Mariano Arista]] crossed the Rio Grande into the disputed territory east of the river with the intention of attacking American General [[Zachary Taylor| Zachary Taylor's]] forward base, [[Fort Texas]]. Taylor, expecting Fort Texas to be invested, took his main force approximately 20 miles east to protect his main supply base, Fort Polk, leaving 500 men, under Major [[Jacob Brown]], to garrison the forward base. Arista's investment of Fort Texas began on May 3 and continued for several days, during which time Major Brown was mortally wounded. On May 7 Taylor departed Fort Polk, on the coast near Port Isabel, and began to move west towards the relief of Fort Texas. Arista, given timely intelligence of Taylor's departure, moved his main force to block Taylor along the Port Isabel Road. The two armies met the next day, May 8, when Taylor's columns engaged the Mexican line around 2 P.M. The Americans repulsed an initial cavalry charge to their right, and were then able to advance 1,000 yards when a grass fire forced Arista's line back. After a second failed cavalry charge, Arista advanced on the American left but was driven back by the quick and accurate fire of the American light artillery. Eager to seize the initiative from Arista, a mixed force of infantry and dragoons pressed forward against the retreating Mexican right, eventually driving them from the field. After dusk ended the fighting, Arista began to pull his forces away from the battlefield to a more defensible position in a dry river bed to the south. Taylor pursued the following day, leading to the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, on May 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/paal/learn/historyculture/paloalto.htm|title=Palo Alto Battlefield - Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)|website=www.nps.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the battle was a clear American victory and casualties were very light, 5 dead and 43 wounded, two of the dead were the resolute commander of Fort Texas, Major Brown, and the innovative artillery officer Major [[Samuel Ringgold (United States Army officer)|Samuel Ringgold]], whose fast and mobile "flying artillery" would continue to be a major advantage to Taylor throughout the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qep01|title=PALO ALTO, BATTLE OF|first=SANCHEZ, JOSEPH|last=P.|date=15 June 2010|website=tshaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative history==

The law began its legislative life as House Resolution 1642, (102nd) sponsored by [[Solomon Ortiz]], (D) the Representative for the 27th congressional district of [[Texas]], who introduced it on March 22, 1991. Two months later the House Committee on Natural Resources ordered the creation of a report advising further consideration on the bill. After deliberation, the House approved the bill on June 3, 1991 by a vote of 323-8. The next day, June 4, the bill was approved without changes by the Senate. On June 22, 1992, the bill was signed into law by President [[George H. W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/102/hr1642|title=Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Site Act of 1991 (1992 - H.R. 1642)|website=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Section One==

The initial section of the law only notes that the measure may be referred to as the "Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Site Act of 1991."&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/102/hr1642/text|title=Text of H.R. 1642 (102nd): Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Site Act of 1991 (Passed Congress/Enrolled Bill version) - GovTrack.us|website=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Section Two==

This section contained two specific Congressional findings that helped rationalize the creation of the park. The first finding stated that an earlier Park Service study had "resulted in a precise identification of the location of the Battle of Palo Alto and the area requiring protection," while the second found that there was "no unit of the National Park System directed to the preservation and interpretation of resources related to the Mexican–American War."&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt;

==Section Three==

The third section of the law officially established the Palo Alto Battlefield Historic Site, "in order," Congress mandated, "to preserve for the education, benefit, and inspiration of present and future generations the nationally significant site of the first battle of the Mexican–American War, and to provide for its interpretation in such manner as to portray the battle and the Mexican–American War and its related political, diplomatic, military and social causes and consequences."

This section also established the size and boundaries of the historic area at "approximately 3,400 acres as generally depicted on the map entitled 'Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Site', numbered 469–80,002, and dated March 1991," and further ordered the Secretary of the Interior to file a legal description and map of the historic area with House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt;

==Section Four==

This section placed responsibility for the historic site in the hands of the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], as the official responsible for the [[National Park Service]], and enjoined the Secretary to "protect, manage, and administer the historic site for the purposes of preserving and interpreting the cultural and natural resources of the historic site and providing for the public understanding and appreciation of the historic site in such a manner as to perpetuate these qualities and values for future generations."&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt;

==Section Five==

The law further empowered the Secretary of the Interior to acquire title or interest in any lands need to fill out the boundaries of the historic site by purchase, donation, or exchange.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt;

==Section Six==

This section authorized the Secretary of the Interior to enter into cooperative agreements with the government of Mexico and owners of Mexican–American war-related properties in the United States "for the purposes of conducting joint research and interpretive planning for the historic site and related Mexican–American War sites."&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt;

==Section Seven==

Ordered the Secretary of the Interior to submit, within three years, a management plan for the historic site to the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. This plan was to include a resource protection program, a land acquisition plan, plans for visitor use and interpretive programs, a research program, and a general development plan that included roads, trails, markers, structures, and other facilities.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt;

==Section Eight==

Provided for a appropriation of $6,000,000 "for acquisition of lands and interests in lands for purposes of the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Site."

'''Pan Am Flight 103''' was a regularly scheduled [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] [[transatlantic flight]] from [[Frankfurt]] to [[Detroit]] via [[London]] and [[New York City|New York]]. On 21 December 1988, N739PA, the aircraft operating the transatlantic leg of the route, was destroyed by a bomb, killing all 243 passengers and 16 crew – a disaster known as the '''Lockerbie bombing'''.&lt;ref name="panamair_victims"&gt;{{cite web|year=2007 |url=http://www.panamair.org/accidents/lockerbievictims.htm |title=Clipper Maid of the Seas: Remembering those on flight 103 |publisher=panamair.org |accessdate=8 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326232104/http://www.panamair.org/accidents/lockerbievictims.htm |archivedate=26 March 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large sections of the aircraft crashed onto residential areas of [[Lockerbie]], [[Scotland]], killing 11 people on the ground.
 
Following a three-year joint investigation by [[Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary]] and the US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), arrest warrants were issued for two Libyan nationals in November 1991. In 1999, Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] handed over the two men for trial at [[Camp Zeist, Netherlands]], after protracted negotiations and UN sanctions. In 2001, Libyan intelligence officer [[Abdelbaset al-Megrahi]] was jailed for life after being found guilty of 270 counts of murder in connection with the bombing. In August 2009, he was [[Release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi|released]] by the [[Scottish Government]] on compassionate grounds after being diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]]. He died in May 2012 as the only person to be convicted for the attack.

In 2003, Gaddafi accepted responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing and paid compensation to the families of the victims, although he maintained that he had never given the order for the attack.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; During the [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libyan Civil War]] in 2011, former Minister of Justice Mustafa Abdul Jalil claimed that the Libyan leader had personally ordered the bombing, though this was later denied.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-12552587|title=Colonel Gaddafi 'ordered Lockerbie bombing|publisher=BBC NEWS|date=23 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flight==
The ''Clipper Maid of the Seas'' operated the transatlantic leg of Flight 103, which had originated at [[Frankfurt Airport]], [[West Germany]], on a [[Boeing 727]]. Both Pan Am and [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]] routinely changed the type of aircraft operating different legs of a flight. PA103 was bookable as a single Frankfurt-New York itinerary, though a scheduled change of aircraft took place in London. At [[London Heathrow Airport]], passengers and their luggage on the feeder flight transferred directly onto the Boeing 747, along with unaccompanied interline luggage. The aircraft pushed back from the terminal at 18:04 and took off from runway 27R at 18:25, en route for [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York JFK Airport]] and on to [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport]].  Contrary to many popular accounts of the disaster (though repeated, with reference, [[#Civil investigation|below]]), the flight, which had a scheduled gate departure time of 18:00, left Heathrow airport on time&lt;!--this conflicts with this article later on--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=David|title=Lockerbie, the real story|year=1989|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Ltd.|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Transcript of the trial of the Scottish court at Camp Zeist 2000, page 59&lt;/ref&gt;

After the bombing, the flight number was changed, in accordance with standard practice among airlines after disasters.  Within days, the Frankfurt-London-New York-Detroit route was being served by Pan Am Flight 3.&lt;ref&gt;Pan Am Flight Guide, Winter 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

The explosion occurred almost directly under the "P" in "Pan Am" on the other side of the fuselage.]]

===Contact is lost===
At 18:58, the aircraft established [[two-way radio]] contact with [[Shanwick Oceanic Control|Shanwick Oceanic Area Control]] in Prestwick on frequency 123.95&amp;nbsp;MHz.

The ''Clipper Maid of the Seas'' approached the corner of the [[Solway Firth]] at 19:01 and crossed the coast at 19:02 UTC. On scope, the aircraft showed [[transponder code]], or "squawk," 0357 and [[flight level]] 310. At this point, the ''Clipper Maid of the Seas'' was flying at {{convert|31000|ft|m}} on a heading of 316 degrees magnetic, and at a speed of {{convert|313|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} [[calibrated airspeed]]. Subsequent analysis of the radar returns by [[RSRE]] concluded that the aircraft was tracking 321° (grid) and travelling at a ground speed of 803&amp;nbsp;km/h (499&amp;nbsp;mph; 434 knots).{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

At 19:02:44, the clearance delivery officer at Shanwick transmitted its oceanic route clearance. The aircraft did not acknowledge this message. The ''Clipper Maid of the Seas''{{'}} "squawk" then flickered off. Air Traffic Control tried to make contact with the flight, with no response. At this time a loud sound was recorded on the [[cockpit voice recorder]] (CVR) at 19:02:50. Five radar echoes fanning out appeared, instead of one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnausers.d-n-a.net/dnetGOjg/Lockerbie.htm |title=Lockerbie Accident Investigation |publisher=Dnausers.d-n-a.net |accessdate=5 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514083021/http://dnausers.d-n-a.net/dnetGOjg/Lockerbie.htm |archivedate=14 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CoxandFoster"&gt;Cox, Matthew, and Foster, Tom.

===Disintegration of aircraft===
The explosion punched a 50-cm (20-inch) hole on the left side of the fuselage. Investigators from the US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) concluded that no emergency procedures had been started in the cockpit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cox|Foster|1992|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cockpit voice recorder, located in the tail section of the aircraft, was found in a field by police searchers within 24 hours. There was no evidence of a distress signal; a 180-millisecond hissing noise could be heard as the explosion destroyed the aircraft's communications centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cox|Foster|1992|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the explosion was in the aircraft hold, the effect was magnified by the [[Uncontrolled decompression|large difference in pressure]] between the aircraft's interior and exterior, i.e., uncontrolled decompression of the fuselage. The steering cables had been disrupted and the fuselage pitched downwards and to the left.&lt;ref name="Cox 1992 71"&gt;{{harvnb|Cox|Foster|1992|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pan Am 103 AAIB model fuselage damage.jpg|thumb|right|[[Air Accident Investigation Branch|AAIB]] model showing fuselage and tail fracture lines and ground locations of parts.&lt;br /&gt;Green—southern wreckage trail;&lt;br /&gt;red—northern wreckage trail;&lt;br /&gt;grey—impact crater;&lt;br /&gt;yellow—Rosebank (Lockerbie);&lt;br /&gt;white—not recovered/identified.&lt;ref name=officialaaib/&gt;{{rp|15–19}} ]]

Investigators from the [[Air Accidents Investigation Branch]] (AAIB) of the British [[Department for Transport]] concluded that the nose of the aircraft was effectively blown off, and was separated from the main section within three seconds of the explosion. The nose cone was briefly held on by a band of metal but facing aft, like the lid of a can. It then sheared off, up and backwards to starboard, striking off the No. 3 engine and landing some distance outside the town, on a hill in the [[civil parish]] of [[Tundergarth]].

===Fuselage impact===

The fuselage continued moving forward and down until it reached {{convert|19000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, at which point its dive became nearly vertical.&lt;ref name=officialaaib/&gt;{{rp|44}} The rear fuselage, parts of the baggage hold and three landing gear units landed at Rosebank Crescent.&lt;ref name=officialaaib/&gt;{{rp|44}} The fuselage consisting of the main wing box structure landed in Sherwood Crescent, creating a large impact crater where three homes previously stood. The {{convert|200000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of jet fuel ignited by the impact started fires which destroyed several additional houses.&lt;ref name=officialaaib/&gt;{{rp|4}} Investigators were able to determine that both wings had landed in the Sherwood Crescent crater, saying "the total absence of debris from the wing primary structure found remote from the crater confirmed the initial impression that the complete wing box structure had been present at the main impact."&lt;ref name=officialaaib&gt;{{cite book|last1=Air Accidents Investigation Branch|first1=UK Department of Transport|title=Aircraft Accident Report 2/90: Report on the Accident to Boeing 747-121, N739PA at Lockerbie, Dumfriesshire, Scotland on 21 December 1988|date=1990|publisher=Crown Publishing|location=London, UK|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5422f36ee5274a1317000489/2-1990_N739PA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}} The [[British Geological Survey]] {{convert|23|km|mi}} away at [[Eskdalemuir Observatory|Eskdalemuir]] registered a [[Seismology|seismic]] event at 19:03:36 measuring 1.6 on the [[moment magnitude scale]], which was attributed to the impact. According to the report, the rest of the wreckage composed of "the complete fuselage forward of approximately station 480 to station 380 and incorporating the flight deck and nose landing gear was found as one piece in a field approximately {{convert|4|km|miles}} east of Lockerbie."&lt;ref name=officialaaib/&gt;{{rp|16}} This field, located opposite [[List of listed buildings in Tundergarth, Dumfries and Galloway|Tundergarth Church]], is where the wreckage most easily identified with images of the accident in the media fell, having fallen "almost flat on its left side but with a slight nose-down attitude."&lt;ref name=officialaaib/&gt;{{rp|16}}

All 243 passengers and 16 crew members were killed, as were 11 residents of Lockerbie on the ground. Of the 270 total fatalities, 190 were American citizens and 43 were British citizens. Nineteen other nationalities were represented, with four or fewer passengers per country.&lt;ref name="Mayday"&gt;"Pan Am 103." ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Victims"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victimsofpanamflight103.org/victims |title=Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 |accessdate=16 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crew===
Flight 103 was under the command of Captain James Bruce MacQuarrie (55), an experienced pilot with almost 11,000 flight hours, of which more than 4,000 had been accrued in 747 aircraft. First Officer Ray Wagner (52) had approximately 5,500 flight hours in the 747 and a total of almost 12,000 hours. Flight Engineer Jerry Don Avritt (46) had more than 8,000 hours of flying experience. He had come to Pan Am through the 1980 merger with [[National Airlines (1934–1980)|National Airlines]]. The cockpit crew was based at JFK.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaib.gov.uk/cms_resources.cfm?file=/2-1990%20N739PA.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Six of the cabin crew members became naturalized US citizens while working for Pan Am. The cabin crew lived in the London area or commuted from around Europe. All were originally hired by Pan Am and ranged from 28 years to nine months in seniority.

The captain, first officer, flight engineer, a flight attendant and several First Class passengers were found still strapped to their seats inside the nose section when it crashed in Tundergarth. The inquest heard that a flight attendant was found alive by a farmer's wife, but died before her discoverer could summon help. Some passengers may have remained alive briefly after impact; a pathologist report concluded that at least two of these passengers might have survived if they had been found soon enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Busuttil|first1=Anthony|title=Lockerbie and Dunblane: Disasters and Dilemmas|journal=Medico-Legal Journal|date=25 June 2016|volume=66|issue=4|pages=126–140|doi=10.1177/002581729806600403|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/002581729806600403|language=en|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CoxandFoster"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/267865.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Lockerbie pair 'could have survived' |publisher=BBC News |date=|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passengers===

====Syracuse University students====
Thirty-five of the passengers were students from [[Syracuse University#Pan Am Flight 103|Syracuse University]] returning home for Christmas following a semester studying in London at Syracuse's London and Florence campuses.

====Notable passengers====
Prominent among the passenger victims was the 50-year-old [[UN Commissioner for Namibia]], [[Bernt Carlsson]], who would have attended the signing ceremony of the [[New York Accords]] at the [[UN headquarters]] the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/22/world/un-officer-on-flight-103.html |title=UN Officer on Flight 103 |date=22 December 1988 |work=New York Times |accessdate=5 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also aboard was Volkswagen America CEO [[James Fuller (automobile executive)|James Fuller]] who was returning from a meeting with Volkswagen executives in West Germany; and musician [[Paul Jeffreys]], formerly bass player with [[Steve Harley &amp; Cockney Rebel]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

[[Matthew Gannon]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s deputy station chief in [[Beirut]], Lebanon, was sitting in Clipper Class, Pan Am's version of business class,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EverythingPanAm.com The Virtual Pan Am Museum |url=http://www.everythingpanam.com/index.html |accessdate=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; seat 14J.

====US government officials====
There were at least four US government officials on the passenger list with rumours, never confirmed, of a fifth on board. The presence of these men on the flight later gave rise to [[Pan Am Flight 103 conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories]], in which one or more of them were said to have been targeted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Ashton |first1=John |last2=Ferguson |first2=Ian |title=Flight from the truth |date=27 June 2001 |work=The Guardian|location=UK |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jun/27/lockerbie.features11 |accessdate=8 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lockerbie residents===
Eleven Lockerbie residents on Sherwood Crescent were killed when the wing section hit the house at 13 Sherwood Crescent at more than {{convert|800|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} and exploded, creating a crater {{convert|47|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and with a volume of {{convert|560|m3|cuyd|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaib.gov.uk/cms_resources/dft_avsafety_pdf_503158.pdf |title=Aircraft Accident Report No 2/90 (EW/C1094) |publisher=[[Air Accidents Investigation Branch]] |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property was completely destroyed, and its occupants, Dora and Maurice Henry, were killed. Their bodies were never found. Several other houses and their foundations were destroyed, and 21 others were damaged so badly they had to be demolished. 

Four members of one family, Jack and Rosalind Somerville and their children Paul (13), and Lyndsey (10), died when their house at 15 Sherwood Crescent exploded. The bodies of the two children were never found.

Kathleen Flannigan (41), her husband Thomas (44), and their daughter Joanne (10), were killed by the explosion in their house at 16 Sherwood Crescent. The bodies of Mr and Mrs Flannigan were never found. Their son Steven (14) witnessed a fireball engulfing his home from a neighbour's garage, where he had been repairing his sister's bicycle. Their other son, 19-year-old David, was in [[Blackpool]] at the time. David later turned to alcohol and drugs, and died from heart failure in [[Thailand]] in December 1993, aged 24. Steven died in August 2000, aged 26, after being hit by a train in [[Wiltshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/aug/27/lockerbie.ameliahill |title=Destroyed by the curse of Lockerbie |date=27 August 2000 |work=The Guardian|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other Lockerbie residents who died were 81-year-old Mary Lancaster and 82-year-old Jean Murray, who also both lived in Sherwood Crescent. Both widows, they were the two oldest victims of the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2013/12/pan_am_flight_103s_victims_a_list_of_those_killed_25_years_ago.html |title=Pan Am Flight 103's Victims: A list of Those Killed 25 Years Ago |date=21 December 2013 |work=Syracuse.com|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fireball rose above the houses and moved toward the nearby Glasgow–Carlisle [[A74 road|A74]] dual carriageway, scorching cars in the southbound lanes and leading motorists and local residents to believe that there had been a meltdown at the nearby [[Chapelcross nuclear power station]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Keegans' house at 1 Sherwood Crescent was the only one on the street that was neither destroyed by the impact nor gutted by fire.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Peter (21 December 21, 2008).

Despite being advised by their governments not to travel to Lockerbie, many of the passengers' relatives, most of them from the US, arrived there within days to identify the dead. Volunteers from Lockerbie set up and staffed canteens, which stayed open 24 hours a day and offered relatives, soldiers, police officers, and social workers free sandwiches, hot meals, coffee, and someone to talk to. The people of the town washed, dried, and ironed every piece of clothing that was found once the police had determined they were of no forensic value, so that as many items as possible could be returned to the relatives. The [[BBC]]'s Scotland correspondent, Andrew Cassell, reported on the 10th anniversary of the bombing that the townspeople had "opened their homes and hearts" to the relatives, bearing their own losses "stoically and with enormous dignity", and that the bonds forged then continue to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Cassel, Andrew (21 December 1998).

==Prior alerts==
Two alerts were released shortly before the bombing.

===Helsinki warning===
On 5 December 1988 (16 days prior to the attack), the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) issued a security bulletin saying that, on that day, a man with an Arabic accent had telephoned the US Embassy in [[Helsinki]], Finland, and told them that a Pan Am flight from [[Frankfurt]] to the United States would be blown up within the next two weeks by someone associated with the [[Fatah - the Revolutionary Council|Abu Nidal Organization]]; he said a Finnish woman would carry the bomb on board as an unwitting courier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=President's Commission on Aviation Safety and Terrorism |title=Report of the President's Commission on Aviation Safety and Terrorism |work=Executive Order 12686 |publisher=US Government Printing Office |date=15 May 1990 |page=8 |url=http://www.policyfutures.com/PCAST/PCASTreport.pdf |accessdate=15 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anonymous warning was taken seriously by the US government, and the [[State Department]] cabled the bulletin to dozens of embassies. The FAA sent it to all US carriers, including Pan Am, which had charged each of the passengers a $5 security surcharge, promising a "program that will screen passengers, employees, airport facilities, baggage and aircraft with unrelenting thoroughness";&lt;ref&gt;''The Independent'', 29 March 1990&lt;/ref&gt; the security team in Frankfurt found the warning under a pile of papers on a desk the day after the bombing.&lt;ref name="CoxandFoster"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} One of the Frankfurt security screeners, whose job was to spot explosive devices under X-ray, told [[ABC News]] that she had first learned what [[Semtex]] (a plastic explosive) was during her ABC interview 11 months after the bombing.&lt;ref&gt;''Prime Time Live'', November 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December, the warning was posted on bulletin boards in the US Embassy in [[Moscow]] and eventually distributed to the entire American community there, including journalists and businessmen.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

The Swedish-language national Finnish newspaper ''[[Hufvudstadsbladet]]'' reported on the front page of its 23 December 1988 issue — two days after the bombing — that a State Department spokesperson in Washington, [[Phyllis Oakley]], confirmed the details of the bomb threat to the Helsinki Embassy. The newspaper writes that, "according to the spokesperson, the anonymous telephone voice also stated that the bomb would be transported from Helsinki to Frankfurt and onwards to New York on Pan-Am's flight to the US. The person transporting the bomb would not themselves be aware of it, with the explosives hidden in that person's luggage." The same news article reports that the US Embassy in Moscow also received the same threat on 5 December, adding that Finland's foreign ministry has found no evidence in its investigations of any link to the Lockerbie crash. "The foreign ministry assumes that an Arab living in Finland is behind the phone threat to the US Embassy in Helsinki. According to the foreign ministry's sources, the Arab has phoned throughout the year with threatening calls to the Israeli and US embassies [in Helsinki]," wrote the paper. "The man who rang the embassies claimed to belong to Abu Nidal's radical Palestinian faction that has been responsible for many terrorist actions. The man said that a bomb would be placed on board a Pan-Am plane by a woman." The article continues, "This has led to speculation that a Finnish woman placed the bomb aboard the downed aircraft. One of Abu Nidal's highest operative leaders, Samir Muhammed Khadir, who died last summer in a terrorist attack against the ship [[City of Poros (ship)|City of Poros]], had lived outside Stockholm. He was married to a Finnish-born woman."{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===PLO warning===
Just days before the sabotage of the aircraft, security forces in European countries, including the UK, were put on alert after a warning from the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) that extremists might launch terrorist attacks to undermine the then ongoing dialogue between the United States and the PLO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/archive/tol_archive/article6794731.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1151003209000 |title=Bomb fear in UK's worst air disaster |date=22 December 1988 |work=The Times|accessdate=31 October 2009 | location=London | first1=Harvey | last1=Elliott | first2=David | last2=Sapsted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims of responsibility==
[[File:CIAPA103D.jpg|thumb|right|upright|CIA analysis of various claims of responsibility for the bombing]]
According to a CIA analysis dated 22 December 1988, several groups were quick to claim responsibility in telephone calls in the United States and Europe:

* A male caller claimed that a group called the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Guardians of the Islamic Revolution]] had destroyed the plane in retaliation for [[Iran Air Flight 655]] being shot down by US forces in the Persian Gulf the previous July.
* A caller claiming to represent the [[Islamic Jihad Organization]] told [[ABC News]] in New York that the group had planted the bomb to commemorate [[Christmas]].
*Another caller claimed responsibility for the "[[Ulster unionism|Ulster Defence League]]".
*Another caller claimed the plane had been downed by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service.&lt;ref name="CIA document"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/docs/DOC_0000427163/0000427163_0002.gif |title=CIA document |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060201124253/http://www.foia.cia.gov/docs/DOC_0000427163/0000427163_0002.gif |archivedate=1 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foia.cia.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/docs/DOC_0000427163/0000427163_0003.gif |title=CIA document |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015140104/http://www.foia.cia.gov/docs/DOC_0000427163/0000427163_0003.gif |archivedate=15 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The list's author noted, "We consider the claims from the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution as the most credible one received so far," but the analysis concluded, "We cannot assign responsibility for this tragedy to any terrorist group at this time.

[[Muammar Gaddafi]] took responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing and paid compensation to the victims' families in 2003, though he maintained that he had not ordered the attack.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; On 22 February 2011, during the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]], former Minister of Justice Mustafa Abdul Jalil stated in an interview with the Swedish newspaper ''Expressen'' that Muammar Gaddafi had personally ordered the bombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Muammar Gaddafi ordered Lockerbie bombing, says Libyan minister|url=http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/muammar-gaddafi-ordered-lockerbie-bombing-says-libyan-minister/story-e6frfku0-1226011070628|accessdate=23 February 2011|newspaper=news.com.au|date=24 February 2011}} citing an original interview with Expressen in Sweden: {{Cite news|title=Khadaffi gav order om Lockerbie-attentatet [Gaddafi ordered the Lockerbie bombing]|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/1.2341356/khadaffi-gav-order-om-lockerbie-attentatet|accessdate=23 February 2011|date=23 February 2011}} [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=sv&amp;u=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/1.2341356/khadaffi-gav-order-om-lockerbie-attentatet&amp;ei=M1FlTc-NCsqBOqz6mJUG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ7gEwAA&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://www.expressen.se/nyheter/1.2341356/khadaffi-gav-order-om-lockerbie-attentatet%26num%3D100%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dopera%26hs%3DsZz%26rls%3Den%26channel%3Dsuggest%26prmd%3Divns English translation]&lt;/ref&gt; Jalil claimed to possess "documents that prove [his allegations] and [that he is] ready to hand them over to the international criminal court."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Libya rebel leader: I have evidence Gaddafi ordered Lockerbie|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8380133/Libya-rebel-leader-I-have-evidence-Gaddafi-ordered-Lockerbie.html|accessdate=10 June 2012|newspaper=telegraph.co.uk|date=14 March 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jalil later denied making this claim, saying he was misquoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Lockerbie: The truth at last|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/332936/Lockerbie-The-truth-at-last|accessdate=2 February 2015|newspaper=express.co.uk|date=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, it was revealed that the original prime suspects in the bombing had been the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command]] (PFLP-GC), a [[Syria]]-based group led by [[Ahmed Jibril]]. A flood of warnings immediately preceding the disaster had included one that read: ‘team of Palestinians not associated with PLO intends to attack US targets in Europe. Time frame is present. Targets specified are Pan Am Airlines and US military bases.’ Five weeks before this warning, Jibril's right-hand man, Haffez Dalkamoni, had been arrested in Frankfurt with a known bomb-maker, Marwen Khreesat. "Later US intelligence officials confirmed that members of the group had been monitoring Pan Am's facilities at Frankfurt airport. On Dalkamoni's account bombs made by Khreesat were at large somewhere." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n18/gareth-pierce/the-framing-of-al-megrahi Gareth Pierce,24 September 2009, London Review of Books]&lt;/ref&gt; A deep cover [[CIA]] agent was told by up to 15 high-level [[Syria]]n officials that the PFLP-GC was involved, and officials interacted with Jibril "on a constant basis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/lockerbie-bombing-libya-palestine-cia-murder-thatcher|title=Secret CIA testimony identifies real Lockerbie mastermind|work=Channel 4 News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, an Iranian ex-spy asserted that Iran ordered the attack.&lt;ref&gt;J Post, 11 March 2014 [http://www.jpost.com/International/Iranian-ex-spy-to-Al-Jazeera-Khomeini-ordered-downing-of-Pan-Am-flight-103-344994], Daily Telegraph, 10 March 2014 [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/10688179/Lockerbie-bombing-are-these-the-men-who-really-brought-down-Pan-Am-103.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranian foreign ministry swiftly denied any involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/03/12/iran-denies-new-lockerbie-bombing-claims |title=Iran denies new Lockerbie bombing claims &amp;#124; SBS News |publisher=Sbs.com.au |date=12 March 2014 |accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
{{Main article|Pan Am Flight 103 bombing investigation}}

===Civil investigation===
{{Subsections|date=August 2018}}

The initial investigation into the crash site by [[Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary]] involved many helicopter surveys, satellite imaging, and a search of the area by police and soldiers. The wreckage of the crash was scattered over 2,000 square kilometres and AAIB investigators were confronted by a massive jigsaw puzzle in trying to piece the plane back together. In total, 4 million pieces of wreckage were collected and registered on computer files. More than 10,000 pieces of debris were retrieved, tagged and entered into a computer tracking system. The perpetrators had apparently intended the plane to crash into the sea, destroying any traceable evidence, but the late departure time (contrary to  statement, with reference, [[#Flight|above]]),&lt;!--this conflicts with the "Flight" section earlier. Was it late, or just poor calculations by the bombers? --&gt; of the aircraft meant that its explosion over land left a trail of evidence.&lt;ref name="katz"&gt;Katz, Samuel M. "Relentless Pursuit: The DSS and the manhunt for the al-Qaeda terrorists", 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fuselage of the aircraft was reconstructed by air accident investigators, revealing a {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=on}} hole consistent with an explosion in the forward cargo hold. Examination of the baggage containers revealed that the container nearest the hole had blackening, pitting, and severe damage, indicating a "high-energy event" had taken place inside it. A series of test explosions were carried out to confirm the precise location and quantity of explosive used.

[[File:Lockcassette.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Compact Cassette|Cassette]] player similar to the one used in the disaster]]
Fragments of a [[Samsonite]] suitcase believed to have contained the bomb were recovered, together with parts and pieces of circuit board identified as components of a [[Toshiba]] 'Bombeat' RT-SF16&lt;!--- or was it a "453 radio cassette recorder"? /---&gt;, radio cassette player, similar to that used to conceal a Semtex bomb seized by West German police from the Palestinian militant group [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command]] two months earlier. Items of baby clothing, which were subsequently proven to have been made in Malta, were thought to have come from the same suitcase.

The clothes were traced to a Maltese merchant, [[Tony Gauci]], who became a key prosecution witness, testifying that he sold the clothes to a man of Libyan appearance. Gauci was interviewed 23 times, giving contradictory evidence about who had bought the clothes, that person's age and appearance, and the date of purchase, but later identified [[Abdelbaset al-Megrahi]]. As Megrahi had only been in Malta on 7 December, that date was assumed to be the purchase date. This date is in doubt as Gauci had testified that Malta's Christmas lights had not been on when the clothes had been purchased; it was subsequently determined that the lights had been switched on on 6 December. [[Scottish police]] had also failed to inform the defence that another witness had testified seeing Libyan men making a similar purchase on a different day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/02/lockerbie-documents-witness-megrahi US paid reward to Lockerbie witness, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi papers claim] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; An official report, providing information not made available to the defence during the original trial, stated that, on 19 April 1999, four days before identifying al-Megrahi for the first time, Gauci had seen a picture of al-Megrahi in a magazine which connected him to the bombing, a fact which could have distorted his judgment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/29/world/europe/29lockerbie.html Official report discredits Tony Gauci's testimony].&lt;/ref&gt; Gauci was shown the same magazine during his testimony at al-Megrahi's trial and asked if he had identified the photograph in April 1999 as being the person who purchased the clothing; he was then asked if that person was in the court. Gauci then identified al-Megrahi for the court stating – "He is the man on this side. He resembles him a lot".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megrahimystory.net/downloads/Professor%20Steve%20Clark%27s%20report%2018%2012%2008.pdf?

A circuit board fragment, allegedly found embedded in a piece of charred material, was identified as part of an electronic timer similar to one found on a Libyan intelligence agent who had been arrested 10 months previously for carrying materials for a Semtex bomb. The timer was allegedly traced through its Swiss manufacturer, [[Mebo Telecommunications|Mebo]], to the Libyan military, and Mebo employee [[Ulrich Lumpert]] identified the fragment at al-Megrahi's trial. Mebo's owner, [[Edwin Bollier]], testified at the trial that the Scottish police had originally shown him a fragment of a ''brown 8-ply'' circuit board from a [[prototype]] timer which had never been supplied to Libya. Yet the sample he was asked to identify at the trial was a ''green 9-ply'' circuit board that Mebo had indeed supplied to Libya. Bollier wanted to pursue this discrepancy, but was told by trial judge Lord Sutherland that he could not do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mebocom-defilee.ch/affair.html |title=Mebo website |publisher=Mebocom-defilee.ch |accessdate=5 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923140848/http://www.mebocom-defilee.ch/affair.html |archivedate=23 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bollier later claimed that in 1991 he had declined an offer of $4&amp;nbsp;million from the FBI in exchange for his support of the main line of inquiry, though this claim has never been verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/fbi-offered-me-4m-lockerbie-bomb-witness-1-694208 |title=FBI offered me $4m: Lockerbie bomb witness |publisher=The Scotsman |date= |accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 July 2007, Ulrich Lumpert admitted he had lied at the trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,2160655,00.html Vital Lockerbie evidence 'was tampered with'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016002159/http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0%2C%2C2160655%2C00.html |date=16 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[affidavit]] before a Zurich notary public, Lumpert stated that he had stolen a prototype MST-13 printed circuit board from Mebo and gave it without permission on 22 June 1989, to "an official person investigating the Lockerbie case".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.1664337.0.0.php Probe into Lockerbie timer claims]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824114758/http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.1664337.0.0.php |date=24 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr [[Hans Köchler]], a UN observer at the Lockerbie trial who received a copy of Lumpert's affidavit, said: "The Scottish authorities are now obliged to investigate this situation.

A documentary titled ''[[Lockerbie Revisited]]'' aired on 27 April 2009, in which the film's director and narrator, [[Gideon Levy (film director)|Gideon Levy]], interviewed officials involved with the case. Former [[FBI Laboratory]] scientist Fred Whitehurst described the FBI laboratory itself as a "crime scene," where an unqualified colleague [[Thomas Thurman]] would routinely alter his scientific reports. The interviews also revealed that the timer fragment had never been tested for explosives residue due to "budgetary reasons." Thurman, who led the forensic investigation and identified the fragment's Libyan connection, confirmed that it was the "only real piece of evidence against Libya". When asked about the importance of the timer in the conviction of al-Megrahi, FBI Task Force Chief [[Richard Marquise]] stated, "It would be a very difficult case to prove ... I don't think we would ever (have) had an indictment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vpro.nl/programma/tegenlicht/afleveringen/41867169/media/41892895/ |title=Lockerbie revisited |accessdate=5 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828065132/http://www.vpro.nl/programma/tegenlicht/afleveringen/41867169/media/41892895/ |archivedate=28 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigators discovered that a bag had been routed onto PA103 via the interline baggage system at Frankfurt, from the station and approximate time at which bags were unloaded from flight KM180 from Malta. Although documentation for flight KM180 indicated that all bags on that flight were accounted for, the court inferred that the bag came from that flight and that it contained the bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrorismcentral.com/Library/Legal/HCJ/Lockerbie/Lockerbieappealjudgement.html |title=Pan Am 103 -Lockerbie Appeal Judgement |publisher=Terrorismcentral.com |accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, it was revealed that security guard Ray Manley had reported that Heathrow's Pan Am baggage area had been broken into 17 hours before Flight 103 took off.

===Criminal inquiry===
Known as the '''Lockerbie bombing''' and the '''Lockerbie air disaster''' in the UK, it was described by Scotland's [[Lord Advocate]] as the UK's largest criminal inquiry led by the smallest police force in Britain, [[Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isrcl.org/Papers/Boyd.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Lockerbie Trial |author= [[Colin Boyd, Baron Boyd of Duncansby|The Rt Hon Colin Boyd QC]] |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a three-year joint investigation by Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary and the US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], during which 15,000 witness statements were taken, indictments for murder were issued on 13 November 1991 against [[Abdelbaset al-Megrahi]], a Libyan intelligence officer and the head of security for [[Libyan Airways|Libyan Arab Airlines]] (LAA), and [[Lamin Khalifah Fhimah]], the LAA station manager in [[Malta International Airport|Luqa Airport]], Malta. UN sanctions against Libya and protracted negotiations with Libyan leader Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]] secured the handover of the accused on 5 April 1999 to Scottish police at [[Camp Zeist, Netherlands]], which was selected as a neutral venue for their trial.

Both the accused chose not to give evidence in court. On 31 January 2001, Megrahi was convicted of murder by a panel of three Scottish judges and sentenced to life imprisonment, but Fhimah was acquitted. Megrahi's appeal against his conviction was refused on 14 March 2002, and his application to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] was declared inadmissible in July 2003. On 23 September 2003, Megrahi applied to the [[Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission]] (SCCRC) for his conviction to be reviewed, and on 28 June 2007 the SCCRC announced its decision to refer the case to the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] in Edinburgh after it found he "may have suffered a miscarriage of justice".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sccrc.org.uk/ViewFile.aspx?id=293 SCCRC Referral of Megrahi case for 2nd appeal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503204553/http://www.sccrc.org.uk/ViewFile.aspx?id=293 |date=3 May 2011 }}. [[Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission]]. 28 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Megrahi served just over 10 years of his sentence (beginning 5 April 1999),&lt;ref&gt;Transcript of the proceedings of the Scottish court in the Netherlands 2001, day 86&lt;/ref&gt; first in Barlinnie prison, Glasgow, and latterly in Greenock prison, Renfrewshire, throughout which time he maintained that he was innocent of the charges against him. He was released from prison on [[compassionate grounds]] on 20 August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In October 2015, Scottish prosecutors announced that they wanted to interview two Libyan nationals, whom they had identified as new suspects, over the bombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-34543983 |title=Two new Lockerbie bombing suspects identified – BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=15 October 2015 |accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial, appeals, and release==
{{Main article|Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial}}
On 3 May 2000, the trial of [[Abdelbaset al-Megrahi]] and [[Lamin Khalifah Fhimah]] began. Megrahi was found guilty of 270 counts of murder on 31 January 2001, and was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] in Scotland; his co-defendant, Fhimah, was found not guilty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-o.org/Lockerbie_Verdict-31Jan2001.htm Fhimah was found "not guilty"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lockerbie judgment stated: "From the evidence which we have discussed so far, we are satisfied that it has been proved that the primary suitcase containing the explosive device was dispatched from Malta, passed through Frankfurt and was loaded onto PA103 at Heathrow. It is, as we have said, clear that, with one exception the clothing in the primary suitcase was the clothing purchased in Mr Gauci's shop on 7 December 1988. The purchaser was, on Mr Gauci's evidence, a Libyan. The trigger for the explosion was an MST-13 timer of the single solder mask variety. A substantial quantity of such timers had been supplied to Libya. We cannot say that it is impossible that the clothing might have been taken from Malta, united somewhere with a timer from some source other than Libya and introduced into the airline baggage system at Frankfurt or Heathrow. When, however, the evidence regarding the clothing, the purchaser and the timer is taken with the evidence that an unaccompanied bag was taken from KM180 to PA103A, the inference that that was the primary suitcase becomes, in our view, irresistible. As we have also said, the absence of an explanation as to how the suitcase was taken into the system at Luqa is a major difficulty for the Crown case, but after taking full account of that difficulty, we remain of the view that the primary suitcase began its journey at Luqa. The clear inference which we draw from this evidence is that the conception, planning and execution of the plot which led to the planting of the explosive device was of Libyan origin. While no doubt organisations such as the [[PFLP-GC]] and the [[Palestinian Popular Struggle Front|PPSF]] were also engaged in terrorist activities during the same period, we are satisfied that there was no evidence from which we could infer that they were involved in this particular act of terrorism, and the evidence relating to their activities does not create a reasonable doubt in our minds about the Libyan origin of this crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrorismcentral.com/Library/Legal/HCJ/Lockerbie/LockerbieVerdict.html |title=Lockerbie Verdict (paragraph 82) |accessdate=1 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeal===
The defence team had 14 days in which to appeal against Megrahi's conviction, and an additional six weeks to submit the full grounds of the appeal. These were considered by a judge sitting in private who decided to grant Megrahi leave to appeal. The only basis for an appeal under [[Scots law]] is that there has been a "[[miscarriage of justice]]", which is not defined in statute and so it is for the appeal court to determine the meaning of these words in each case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/1764532.stm |title=14 days to launch appeal |work=BBC News|date=14 March 2002 |accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because three judges and one alternate judge had presided over the trial, five judges were required to preside over the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]]:

* [[William Cullen, Baron Cullen of Whitekirk|Lord Cullen]], [[Lord Justice-General]]
* Lord Kirkwood
* [[Kenneth Osborne, Lord Osborne|Lord Osborne]]
* Lord Macfadyen and
* [[William Nimmo Smith, Lord Nimmo Smith|Lord Nimmo Smith]]

In what was described as a milestone in Scottish legal history, Lord Cullen granted the [[BBC]] permission in January 2002 to televise the appeal, and to broadcast it on the Internet in English with a simultaneous Arabic translation.

William Taylor QC, leading the defence, said at the appeal's opening on 23 January 2002 that the three trial judges sitting without a jury had failed to see the relevance of "significant" evidence and had accepted unreliable facts. He argued that the verdict was not one that a reasonable jury in an ordinary trial could have reached if it were given proper directions by the judge. The grounds of the appeal rested on two areas of evidence where the defence claimed the original court was mistaken: the evidence of Maltese shopkeeper, Tony Gauci, which the judges accepted as sufficient to prove that the "primary suitcase" started its journey in Malta; and, disputing the prosecution's case, fresh evidence would be adduced to show that the bomb's journey actually started at Heathrow. That evidence, which was not heard at the trial, showed that at some time in the two hours before 00:35 on 21 December 1988 a padlock had been forced on a secure door giving access air side in Terminal 3 of Heathrow airport, near to the area referred to at the trial as the "baggage build-up area". Taylor claimed that the PA 103 bomb could have been planted then.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/1778449.stm |title=Grounds of appeal|work=BBC News|date=14 March 2002 |accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March 2002, it took Lord Cullen less than three minutes to deliver the decision of the High Court of Judiciary. The five judges rejected the appeal, ruling unanimously that "none of the grounds of appeal was well-founded", adding "this brings proceedings to an end". The following day, a helicopter took Megrahi from Camp Zeist to continue his [[life sentence]] in Barlinnie Prison, [[Glasgow]].

===SCCRC review===
Megrahi's lawyers applied to the [[Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission]] (SCCRC) on 23 September 2003 to have his case referred back to the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] for a fresh appeal against conviction. The application to the SCCRC followed the publication of two reports in February 2001 and March 2002 by Hans Köchler, who had been an international observer at Camp Zeist, Netherlands appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Köchler described the decisions of the trial and appeal courts as a "spectacular miscarriage of justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/1872996.stm |title= UN monitor decries Lockerbie judgement|date=14 March 2002 |accessdate=3 January 2010 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Köchler also issued a series of statements in 2003, 2005, and 2007 calling for an independent international inquiry into the case and accusing the West of "double standards in criminal justice" in relation to the Lockerbie trial on the one hand and the [[HIV trial in Libya]] on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i-p-o.org/koechler-lockerbie-statement-aug2003.htm |title=Dr Hans Köchler's statement, August 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303070959/http://www.i-p-o.org/Koechler-Lockerbie-statement-Aug2003.htm |archivedate=3 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i-p-o.org/nr-lockerbie-14Oct05.htm |title=Dr Hans Köchler's statement, October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i-p-o.org/Koechler-EU-Lockerbie-Bulgaria-14Feb07.pdf |title=Double standards in criminal justice: Pan Am Flight 103 v.

On 28 June 2007, the SCCRC announced its decision to refer Megrahi's case to the High Court for a second appeal against conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sccrc.org.uk/ViewFile.aspx?id=293 |title=SCCRC refers Megrahi's case for second appeal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503204553/http://www.sccrc.org.uk/ViewFile.aspx?id=293 |archivedate=3 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SCCRC's decision was based on facts set out in an 800-page report that determined that "a miscarriage of justice may have occurred".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/29/world/europe/29lockerbie.html |title=SCCRC decides "a miscarriage of justice may have occurred" |work=The New York Times |first=Alan |last=Cowell |date=29 June 2007 |accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Köchler criticised the SCCRC for exonerating police, prosecutors and forensic staff from blame in respect of Megrahi's alleged wrongful conviction. He told ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' of 29 June 2007: "No officials to be blamed, simply a Maltese shopkeeper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i-p-o.org/koechler-lockerbie-referral-29June2007.htm |title=Statement by Dr Hans Köchler on SCCRC decision, 29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Köchler also highlighted the role of intelligence services in the trial and stated that proper judicial proceedings could not be conducted under conditions in which extrajudicial forces are allowed to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i-p-o.org/IPO-nr-Lockerbie-5Oct07.htm Lockerbie trial: an intelligence operation?

A procedural hearing at the [[Court of Criminal Appeal|Appeal Court]] took place on 11 October 2007 when prosecution lawyers and Megrahi's defence counsel, [[Margaret Scott (lawyer)|Maggie Scott QC]], discussed a number of legal issues with a panel of three judges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/scotland/7037821.stm Lockerbie bomber in fresh appeal]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407191142/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/scotland/7037821.stm |date=7 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the issues concerned a number of documents that were shown before the trial to the prosecution, but were not disclosed to the defence. The documents are understood to relate to the [[Mebo Telecommunications|Mebo]] MST-13 timer that allegedly detonated the PA103 bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7023397.stm |title=Secret Lockerbie report claim |work=BBC News|date=2 October 2007 |accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maggie Scott also asked for documents relating to an alleged payment of $2&amp;nbsp;million made to Maltese merchant, [[Tony Gauci]], for his testimony at the trial, which led to the conviction of Megrahi.&lt;ref&gt;Carrell, Severin (3 October 2007).

On 15 October 2008, five Scottish judges decided unanimously to reject a submission by the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service|Crown Office]] which sought to limit the scope of Megrahi's second appeal to the specific grounds of appeal that were identified by the [[SCCRC]] in June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/2008HCJAC58.html |title=Judgement on the scope of Megrahi's second appeal |publisher=Scotcourts.gov.uk |accessdate=5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, it was reported that, although Megrahi's second appeal against conviction was scheduled to begin in April 2009, the hearing could last as long as 12 months because of the complexity of the case and volume of material to be examined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.2481827.0.Secret_talks_on_deal_to_return_Megrahi_to_Libya.php |title=Secret talks on deal to return Megrahi to Libya |author=Lucy Adams |date=15 January 2009 |work=[[Glasgow Herald]] |accessdate=15 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129073546/http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.2481827.0.Secret_talks_on_deal_to_return_Megrahi_to_Libya.php |archivedate=29 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second appeal began on 28 April 2009, lasted for one month and was adjourned in May 2009. On 7 July 2009, the court reassembled for a procedural hearing and was told that because of the illness of one of the judges, Lord Wheatley, who was recovering from heart surgery, the final two substantive appeal sessions would run from 2 November to 11 December 2009, and 12 January to 26 February 2010. Megrahi's lawyer Maggie Scott expressed dismay at the delays: "There is a very serious danger that my client will die before the case is determined."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/lockerbie-megrahi-appeal-will-not-be-heard-until-next-year-1.914180 |title=Lockerbie: Megrahi appeal will not be heard until next year |date=8 July 2009 |work=[[Glasgow Herald]] |accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compassionate release and controversy===
{{Further information|Release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi}}
On 25 July 2009, Megrahi applied to be released from jail on compassionate grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article6794203.ece |title=Timeline: Abdul Baset Ali al-Megrahi and the Lockerbie bombing |date=13 August 2009 |work=The Times|author=Steve Bird |accessdate=1 November 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, on 12 August 2009, Megrahi applied to have his second appeal dropped and was granted compassionate release for his terminal prostate cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/2008HCJAC58.html Summary of the opinion of the court in appeal by Abdelbaset al-Megrahi against Her Majesty's Advocate].

His survival beyond the approximate "three month" prognosis generated some controversy. It is believed that, following his release, Al-Megrahi was prescribed [[abiraterone]] and [[prednisone]], a combination that extends [[Cancer survival rates|median survival]] by an average of 14.8 months. After hospital treatment ended, he returned to his family home. Following his release, Megrahi published evidence on the Internet that was gathered for the abandoned second appeal which he claimed would clear his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megrahimystory.net/ |title=Abdelbaset Ali Al-Megrahi – My Story |accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegations have been made that the UK government and [[BP]] sought Al-Megrahi's release as part of a trade deal with Libya. In 2008, the UK government "decided to ‘do all it could’ to help the Libyans get Al-Megrahi home … and explained the legal procedure for compassionate release to the Libyans."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-02-07/brown-bp-cleared-of-lobbying-scots-to-free-bomber.html|title=Brown, BP Cleared of Lobbying Scots to Free Bomber|work=BusinessWeek|date=7 February 2011|accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Megrahi was released on licence and was therefore obliged to remain in regular contact with [[East Renfrewshire|East Renfrewshire Council]]. On 26 August 2011, it was announced that the whereabouts of Al-Megrahi were unknown due to the social upheaval in Libya and that he had not been in contact for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/politics/Libya-Scottish-officials-still-in.6825374.jp| title=Libya-Scottish-officials|accessdate=25 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927032718/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/politics/Libya-Scottish-officials-still-in.6825374.jp |archivedate=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported on 29 August that he had been located and both the Scottish government and council issued a statement confirming that they had been in contact with his family and that his licence had not been breached. [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Andrew Mitchell]] said Al-Megrahi was [[coma]]tose and near death. CNN reporter [[Nic Robertson]] said he was "just a shell of the man he once was" and was surviving on oxygen and an [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous drip]]. In an interview on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], former US ambassador to the United Nations [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]] called for Al-Megrahi to be extradited.

&lt;blockquote&gt;To me it will be a signal of how serious the rebel government is for good relations with the United States and the West if they hand over Megrahi for trial.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mohammed al-Alagi, justice minister for the new leadership in [[Tripoli]], said "the council would not allow any Libyan to be deported to face trial in another country ... Abdelbaset al-Megrahi has already been judged once, and will not be judged again."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14705004 Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi is 'in coma'] [[BBC News]] 29 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged motives==

===Libya===
[[File:Libya-kart3.svg|right|thumb|Gulf of Sidra.]]
Until 2003, Libya had never formally admitted carrying out the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. On 16 August 2003, Libya formally admitted responsibility for Pan Am Flight 103 in a letter presented to the president of the [[United Nations Security Council]]. Felicity Barringer of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that the letter had "general language that lacked any expression of remorse" for the people killed in the bombing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/16/international/middleeast/16NATI.html Libya Admits Culpability in Crash of Pan Am Plane&lt;/ref&gt;  The letter stated that it "accepted responsibility for the actions of its officials".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/sc7868.doc.htm Security Council lifts sanctions imposed on Libya after terrorist bombings of Pan Am 103 and UTA 772&lt;/ref&gt;

The motive that is generally attributed to Libya can be traced back to a series of military confrontations with the [[US Navy]] that took place in the 1980s in the [[Gulf of Sidra]], the whole of which Libya claimed as its territorial waters. First, there was the [[Gulf of Sidra incident (1981)]] when two Libyan fighter aircraft were shot down by two US Navy [[F-14 Tomcat]] fighters. Then, [[Radio North Sea International#Destination Libya|two Libyan radio ships]] were sunk in the Gulf of Sidra. Later, on 23 March 1986, a Libyan Navy patrol boat was sunk in the Gulf of Sidra,&lt;ref&gt;Speakes, Larry M. (24 March 1986). [http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1986/32486b.htm Statement by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Speakes on the Gulf of Sidra Incident].

[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1079/is_v86/ai_4323912 Gulf of Sidra incident]. US Department of State Bulletin.&lt;/ref&gt; The Libyan leader, [[Muammar Gaddafi]], was accused of retaliating for these sinkings by ordering [[1986 West Berlin discotheque bombing|the April 1986 bombing of La Belle]], a [[West Berlin]] nightclub frequented by US military personnel, killing three people and injuring 230.&lt;ref&gt;Malinarich, Nathalie (13 November 2001). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1653848.stm Flashback: The Berlin disco bombing]. [[BBC News]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[National Security Agency]]'s (NSA) alleged interception of an incriminatory message from Libya to its embassy in East Berlin provided US President [[Ronald Reagan]] with the justification for  [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]] on 15 April 1986, with [[US Navy]] and [[US Marine Corps]] warplanes launching from three aircraft carriers in the Gulf of Sidra and [[US Air Force]] warplanes launching from two British bases&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/el_dorado_canyon.htm USAF bombing of Libya, 1986].

[[BBC News]]. 15 April 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;—the first US military strikes from Britain since World War II—against [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]] in Libya. The Libyan government claimed the air strikes killed [[Hana Gaddafi]], a daughter Gaddafi claimed he adopted (her reported age has varied between 15 months and seven years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aim.org/aim-column/nbc%E2%80%99s-mitchell-regurgitates-gaddafi-lies/ |title=NBC's Mitchell Regurgitates Gaddafi Lies |publisher=Aim.org |accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avenge his daughter's supposed death (Hana or Hanna's actual fate remains disputed), Gaddafi is said to have sponsored the September 1986 hijacking of [[Pan Am Flight 73]] in Karachi, Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;Swain, Jon (28 March 2004). [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article1052614.ece Revealed: Gaddafi's air massacre plot]. ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The US in turn encouraged and aided the [[Chadian National Armed Forces]] (FANT) by supplying [[GEOINT|satellite intelligence]] during the [[Battle of Maaten al-Sarra]]. The attack resulted in a devastating defeat for Gaddafi's forces, following which he had to accede to a [[ceasefire]] ending the [[Chadian-Libyan conflict]] and his dreams of African dominance. Gaddafi blamed the defeat on French and US "aggression against Libya".&lt;ref name=Greenwald&gt;{{Cite news| author=Greenwald, John| title =Disputes Raiders of the Armed Toyotas| newspaper=TIME| date =21 September 1987| url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,965563,00.html| postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was Gaddafi's lingering animosity against the two countries which led to Libyan support for the bombings of Pan Am Flight 103 and [[UTA Flight 772]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19890919-1 |title=ASN Aircraft accident McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 N54629 Ténéré desert |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demands for independent inquiry===
Prior to the abandonment of Megrahi's second appeal against conviction and while new evidence could be still tested in court, there had been few calls for an independent inquiry into the Lockerbie bombing. Demands for such an inquiry emerged later, and became more insistent. On 2 September 2009, former [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Michael McGowan (politician)|Michael McGowan]] demanded that the UK government call for an urgent, independent inquiry led by the UN to find out the truth about Pan Am flight 103. "We owe it to the families of the victims of Lockerbie and the international community to identify those responsible," McGowan said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/opinion/Michael-McGowan-The-best-tribute.5612963.jp |title=The best tribute to the 270 victims of Lockerbie is to find out the truth |date=2 September 2009 |work=[[Yorkshire Post]] |author=Michael McGowan |author-link=Michael McGowan (politician) |accessdate=1 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two online petitions were started: one calling for a UK [[public inquiry]] into the Lockerbie bombing;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lockerbiecase.blogspot.com/2009/09/petition-to-set-up-public-inquiry-into.html |title=Petition to set up public inquiry into Lockerbie |accessdate=2 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the other a UN inquiry into the murder of [[UN Commissioner for Namibia]], [[Bernt Carlsson]], in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. In September 2009, a third petition which was addressed to the [[President of the United Nations General Assembly]] demanded that the UN should "institute a full public inquiry" into the Lockerbie disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.firmmagazine.com/news/1706/Firm_joins_Chomsky%2C_Dalyell_and_others_to_petition_UN_General_Assembly_to_open_Pan_Am_103_inquiry.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024162009/http://www.firmmagazine.com/news/1706/Firm_joins_Chomsky%2C_Dalyell_and_others_to_petition_UN_General_Assembly_to_open_Pan_Am_103_inquiry.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 October 2009 |title=Petition to UN General Assembly to open Pan Am 103 inquiry |date=14 September 2009 |publisher=The Firm magazine |accessdate=2 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 October 2009, Malta was asked to table a [[United Nations General Assembly resolution|UN resolution]] supporting the petition, which was signed by 20 people including the families of the Lockerbie victims, authors, journalists, professors, politicians and parliamentarians, as well as [[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]]. The signatories considered that a UN inquiry could help remove "many of the deep misgivings which persist in lingering over this tragedy" and could also eliminate Malta from this terrorist act. Malta was brought into the case because the prosecution argued that the two accused Libyans, [[Abdelbaset al-Megrahi]] and [[Lamin Khalifah Fhimah]], had placed the bomb on an [[Air Malta]] aircraft before it was transferred at [[Frankfurt International Airport|Frankfurt airport]] to a feeder flight destined for London's [[Heathrow International Airport|Heathrow airport]], from which Pan Am Flight 103 departed. The Maltese government responded saying that the demand for a UN inquiry was "an interesting development that would be deeply considered, although there were complex issues surrounding the event."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20091004/local/malta-asked-to-support-demands-for-un-inquiry-on-lockerbie |title=Malta asked to support demands for UN inquiry on Lockerbie |date=4 October 2009 |work=[[Times of Malta]] |author=Caroline Muscat |accessdate=2 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 August 2009, Lockerbie campaigner [[Dr Jim Swire]] wrote to Prime Minister, [[Gordon Brown]], calling for a full inquiry, including the question of suppression of the [[Heathrow International Airport|Heathrow]] evidence. This was backed up by a delegation of Lockerbie relatives, led by Pamela Dix, who went to [[10 Downing Street]] on 24 October 2009 and handed over a letter addressed to Gordon Brown calling for a meeting with the Prime Minister to discuss the need for a public inquiry and the main issues that it should address.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/6427497/Lockerbie-families-lobby-Gordon-Brown-for-public-inquiry.html? |title=Lockerbie families lobby Gordon Brown for public inquiry |date=25 October 2009 |work=Daily Telegraph |location=UK |accessdate=1 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[op-ed]] article by Pamela Dix, subtitled "The families of those killed in the bombing have not given up hope of an inquiry to help us learn the lessons of this tragedy", was published in ''The Guardian'' on 26 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

UK ministers explained that it was for the Scottish Government to decide if it wants to hold its own, more limited, inquiry into the worst terrorist attack on British soil. The Scottish Government had already rejected an independent inquiry, saying it lacks the constitutional power to examine the international dimensions of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article6898231.ece? |title=Lockerbie inquiry ruled out by Gordon Brown |date=1 November 2009 |work=The Times|author=Jason Allardyce, Mark Macaskill |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concluding his extensive reply dated 27 October 2009 to the Prime Minister, Dr Swire said: "You have now received a much more comprehensive letter requesting a full inquiry from our group 'UK Families-Flight 103'. I am one of the signatories. I hope that the contents of this letter underline some of the reasons as to why I cannot possibly accept that any inquiry should be limited to Scotland, and I apologise if my previous personal letter of 24 August misled you over the main focus that the inquiry will need to address. That focus lies in London and at the door of the then inhabitant of Number 10 Downing Street. I look forward to hearing your comments both to our group's letter and to the contents of this one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lockerbiecase.blogspot.com/2009/11/dr-swires-reply-to-gordon-brown.html |title=Dr Swire's reply to Gordon Brown |accessdate=1 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claims of Gaddafi involvement===

On 23 February 2011, amidst the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]], [[Mustafa Abdul Jalil]], former Libyan Justice Minister (and later member and Chairman of the anti-Gaddafi [[National Transitional Council]]), alleged that he had evidence that Libyan leader, [[Muammar Gaddafi]], had personally ordered [[Abdelbaset al-Megrahi]] to bomb Pan Am Flight 103.&lt;ref name="expressen1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/02/24/3147217.htm |title=Gaddafi accused of ordering Lockerbie bombing |date=23 February 2011 |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |author=Anne Barker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative theories===
{{Main article|Pan Am Flight 103 conspiracy theories}}
Based on a 1995 investigation by journalists [[Paul Foot (journalist)|Paul Foot]] and John Ashton, alternative explanations of the plot to commit the Lockerbie bombing were listed by ''The Guardian'''s Patrick Barkham in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/apr/07/lockerbie.patrickbarkham |title=Lockerbie conspiracies: A to Z |date=7 April 1999 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=10 November 2008 |first=Patrick |last=Barkham}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Lockerbie verdict in 2001 and the appeal in 2002, attempts have been made to re-open the case amid allegations that Libya was framed. One theory suggests the bomb on the plane was detonated by radio. Another theory suggests the [[CIA]] prevented the suitcase containing the bomb from being searched. Iran's involvement is alleged, either in association with a Palestine militant group, or in loading the bomb while the plane was at Heathrow. The US [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] alleges that [[Ali Akbar Mohtashamipur]] (''Ayatollah Mohtashemi''), a member of the Iranian government, paid US$10&amp;nbsp;million for the bombing:

{{quote|Ayatollah Mohtashemi: (...) and was the one who paid the same amount to bomb Pan Am Flight 103 in retaliation for the [[Iran Air Flight 655|US shoot-down of the Iranian Airbus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dia.mil/Portals/27/Documents/FOIA/5%20USC%20%C2%A7%20552(A)(2)(D)%20Records/Other%20Available%20Records/panam103.pdf|format=PDF|title=PAN AM Flight 103|publisher=[[Defense Intelligence Agency]], DOI 910200, page 49/50 (Pages 7 and 8 in PDF document, see also p. 111ff)|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other theories implicate Libya and Abu Nidal, and apartheid South Africa.

===PCAST statement===
On 29 September 1989, President Bush appointed [[Ann McLaughlin Korologos]], former Secretary of Labor, to chair the President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism (PCAST) to review and report on aviation security policy in the light of the sabotage of flight PA103. [[Oliver "Buck" Revell]], the [[FBI]]'s Executive Assistant Director, was assigned to advise and assist PCAST in their task.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalspeakers.com/speakers/ISBB-553LKW/Oliver_ FBI's Oliver "Buck" Revell served as Advisor to PCAST]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813121658/http://www.internationalspeakers.com/speakers/ISBB-553LKW/Oliver_ |date=13 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before submitting their report, the PCAST members met a group of British PA103 relatives at the US embassy in London on 12 February 1990. One of the British relatives, Martin Cadman, alleges that a member of President Bush's staff told him: "Your government and ours know exactly what happened but they are never going to tell."&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, 12 November 1994, page 6, "Cover-up claim as Lockerbie film screening is cancelled".

==Compensation==

===From Libya===
On 29 May 2002, Libya offered up to US$2.7&amp;nbsp;billion to settle claims by the families of the 270 killed in the Lockerbie bombing, representing US$10&amp;nbsp;million per family. The Libyan offer was that 40% of the money would be released when United Nations sanctions, suspended in 1999, were cancelled; another 40% when US trade sanctions were lifted; and the final 20% when the US State Department removed Libya from its [[State Sponsors of Terrorism|list of states sponsoring terrorism]].&lt;ref name="CNN20020529"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2002-05-28/us/libya.lockerbie.settlement_1_libyan-offer-commercial-sanctions-families-of-terror-victims |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707022256/http://articles.cnn.com/2002-05-28/us/libya.lockerbie.settlement_1_libyan-offer-commercial-sanctions-families-of-terror-victims |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 July 2012 |title=Libya offers $2.7&amp;nbsp;billion Pan Am 103 settlement |work=CNN |date=29 May 2002 |first=Andrea |last=Koppel |first2=Elise |last2=Labott |authorlink=Andrea Koppel |accessdate=16 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim Kreindler of the New York law firm [[Kreindler &amp; Kreindler]], which orchestrated the settlement, said: "These are uncharted waters. It is the first time that any of the states designated as sponsors of terrorism have offered compensation to families of terror victims." The US State Department maintained that it was not directly involved. "Some families want cash, others say it is blood money", said a State Department official.&lt;ref name="CNN20020529"/&gt;

Compensation for the families of the PA103 victims was among the steps set by the UN for lifting its sanctions against Libya. Other requirements included a formal denunciation of terrorism—which Libya said it had already made—and "accepting responsibility for the actions of its officials".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/sc7868.doc.htm |title=Security Council lifts sanctions imposed on Libya after terrorist bombings of Pan Am Flight 103 and UTA Flight 772}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN20020529"/&gt;

On 15 August 2003, Libya's UN ambassador, Ahmed Own, submitted a letter to the UN [[Security Council]] formally accepting "responsibility for the actions of its officials" in relation to the Lockerbie bombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libya1.com/news/n2003/august/n16aug3a.htm |title=Libyan government website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050410113224/http://www.libya1.com/news/n2003/august/n16aug3a.htm |archivedate=10 April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Libyan government then proceeded to pay compensation to each family of US$8&amp;nbsp;million (from which legal fees of about US$2.5&amp;nbsp;million were deducted) and, as a result, the UN cancelled the sanctions that had been suspended four years earlier, and US trade sanctions were lifted. A further US$2&amp;nbsp;million would have gone to each family had the US [[State Department]] removed Libya from its list of states regarded as supporting international terrorism, but as this did not happen by the deadline set by Libya, the Libyan Central Bank withdrew the remaining US$540&amp;nbsp;million in April 2005 from the [[escrow]] account in Switzerland through which the earlier US$2.16&amp;nbsp;billion compensation for the victims' families had been paid.&lt;ref name="Lockerbielawyer"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=184&amp;id=1338372003 |work=The Scotsman|title=Lockerbie lawyer says £200m fee is 'good value' |date=6 December 2003 |first=Dan |last=McDougall |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States announced resumption of full diplomatic relations with Libya after deciding to remove it from its [[State Sponsors of Terrorism|list of countries that support terrorism]] on 15 May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4773617.stm |title=US to renew full ties with Libya |work=BBC News|date=15 May 2006 |accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 February 2004, Libyan Prime Minister [[Shukri Ghanem]] stated in a [[BBC]] Radio 4 interview that his country had paid the compensation as the "price for peace" and to secure the lifting of sanctions. Asked if Libya did not accept guilt, he said, "I agree with that." He also said there was no evidence to link Libya with the April 1984 shooting of police officer [[Yvonne Fletcher]] outside the Libyan Embassy in London. Gaddafi later retracted Ghanem's comments, under pressure from Washington and London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/listenagain/ztuesday_20040224.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308174923/http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/listenagain/ztuesday_20040224.shtml |archivedate=8 March 2007 |title=BBC Radio 4, 24 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A civil action against Libya continued until 18 February 2005 on behalf of Pan Am and its insurers, which went bankrupt partly as a result of the attack. The airline was seeking $4.5&amp;nbsp;billion for the loss of the aircraft and the effect on the airline's business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apsu.edu/oconnort/3410/3410lect06.htm |title=Case Studies of Domestic Terrorism |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127061236/http://www.apsu.edu/oconnort/3410/3410lect06.htm |archivedate=27 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the SCCRC's June 2007 decision, there have been suggestions that, if Megrahi's second appeal had been successful and his conviction had been overturned, Libya could have sought to recover the $2.16&amp;nbsp;billion compensation paid to the relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/lockerbie/Libyans-want-their-14bn-payout.3299413.jp |title=Libyans want their £1.4bn payout back |date=28 June 2007 |first=Michael |last=Howe |work=The Scotsman|location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewed by French newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' on 7 December 2007, [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] said that the seven Libyans convicted for the Pan Am Flight 103 and the [[UTA Flight 772]] bombings "are innocent". When asked if Libya would therefore seek reimbursement of the compensation paid to the families of the victims (US$33&amp;nbsp;billion in total), Saif Gaddafi replied: "I don't know".&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/2007/12/07/01003-20071207ARTFIG00487-seif-el-islam-kadhafi-la-libye-sera-un-pays-heureux.php Saif al-Gaddafi says "Libyans are innocent" of the Pan Am Flight 103 and UTA Flight 772 bombings] ''[[Le Figaro]]'' 7 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following discussions in London in May 2008, US and Libyan officials agreed to start negotiations to resolve all outstanding bilateral compensation claims, including those relating to [[UTA Flight 772]], the [[1986 Berlin discotheque bombing]] and Pan Am Flight 103.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7428901.stm |title=Libya to resolve claims with US |work=BBC News|date=31 May 2008 |accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 August 2008, a US-Libya compensation deal was signed in Tripoli by US Assistant Secretary of State [[David Welch (diplomat)|David Welch]] and Libya's Foreign Ministry head of America affairs, Ahmed al-Fatroui. The agreement covers 26 lawsuits filed by American citizens against Libya, and three by Libyan citizens in respect of the US bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986 which killed at least 40 people and injured 220.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=US-Libya compensation deal sealed |date=14 August 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7561271.stm |work=BBC News|accessdate=14 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008 Libya paid $1.5&amp;nbsp;billion into a fund which will be used to compensate relatives of the

As a result, [[George W.

In an interview shown in [[BBC Two]]'s ''The Conspiracy Files: Lockerbie''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/print/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/08_august/29/lockerbie.shtml |title=Gaddafi's son attacks "greedy" Lockerbie relatives in BBC Two documentary |date=29 August 2008|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 31 August 2008, Saif Gaddafi said that Libya had admitted responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing simply to get trade sanctions removed. He went on to describe the families of the Lockerbie victims as very greedy: "They were asking for more money and more money and more money".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Lockerbie evidence not disclosed |date=28 August 2008 |work=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/south_of_scotland/7573244.stm |accessdate=29 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the victims families refused to accept compensation due to their belief that Libya was not responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Conspiracy Files:Lockerbie |date=1 September 2008 |work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/conspiracy_files/7570580.stm |accessdate=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====February 2011====
In an interview with Swedish newspaper [[Expressen]] on 23 February 2011, [[Mustafa Abdul Jalil]], former Justice Secretary of Libya, claimed to have evidence that Gaddafi personally ordered Al-Megrahi to carry out the bombing.&lt;ref name="expressen1"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Khadaffi gav order om Lockerbie-attentatet|date=23 February 2011 |work=Expressen |url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/1.2341356/khadaffi-gav-order-om-lockerbie-attentatet|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quotes: "[Jalil] told Expressen Khadafy [sic] gave the order to Abdel Baset al-Megrahi, the only man convicted in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground on 21 December 1988.
'To hide it, he (Khadafy) did everything in his power to get al-Megrahi back from Scotland,' Abdel-Jalil was quoted as saying."&lt;ref name="nypost1"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/khadafy_ordered_lockerbie_bombing_vpkR8Cz6u1q59aR8k2R98I | work=New York Post | title=Khadafy ordered Lockerbie bombing, says Libyan minister | date=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Jalil's commentary to the Expressen came during widespread political unrest and protests in Libya calling for the removal of Ghaddafi from power. The protests were part of a massive wave of unprecedented uprisings across the Arab world in: Tunisia, Morocco, Bahrain and Egypt, where Egyptian protesters effectively forced the removal of long-term ruler, Hosni Mubarak, from office. Jalil's comments came on a day when Ghaddafi's defiance and refusal to leave his command prompted his brutal attacks on Libyan protesters.

Abdel-Jalil stepped down as minister of justice in protest over the violence against anti-government demonstrations.&lt;ref name="nypost1"/&gt;

====Contingency fees for lawyers====
On 5 December 2003, Jim Kreindler revealed that his Park Avenue law firm would receive an initial contingency fee of around US$1&amp;nbsp;million from each of the 128 American families Kreindler represents. The firm's fees could exceed US$300&amp;nbsp;million eventually. Kreindler argued that the fees were justified, since "Over the past seven years we have had a dedicated team working tirelessly on this and we deserve the contingency fee we have worked so hard for, and I think we have provided the relatives with value for money."&lt;ref name="Lockerbielawyer"/&gt;

Another top legal firm in the US, Speiser Krause, which represented 60 relatives, of whom half were UK families, concluded contingency deals securing them fees of between 28 and 35% of individual settlements. Frank Granito of Speiser Krause noted that "the rewards in the US are more substantial than anywhere else in the world but nobody has questioned the fee whilst the work has been going on, it is only now as we approach a resolution when the criticism comes your way."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=McDougall |first=Dan |date=9 November 2002 |url=http://news.scotsman.com/lockerbie/US-Lockerbie-lawyers-to-net.2376651.jp |title=US Lockerbie lawyers to net £500m |work=The Scotsman |location=UK |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090830003331/http://news.scotsman.com/lockerbie/US-Lockerbie-lawyers-to-net.2376651.jp |archivedate=30 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, it was announced that US lobbying firm, Quinn Gillespie &amp; Associates, received fees of $2&amp;nbsp;million for the work it did from 2006 through 2008 helping the PA103 relatives obtain payment by Libya of the final $2&amp;nbsp;million compensation (out of a total of $10&amp;nbsp;million) that was due to each family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.blnz.com/news/2009/03/03/INFLUENCE_GAME_Libya_case_gets_4914.html|title=The Influence Game: Lobbyists who aided families of Pan Am bombing victims earn $2&amp;nbsp;million fee |accessdate=7 March 2014 |first=Alan |last=Fram |agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===From Pan Am===
In 1992, a US federal court found Pan Am guilty of willful misconduct due to lax security screening.

There are several private and public memorials to the PA103 victims. ''Dark Elegy'' is the work of sculptor Susan Lowenstein of Long Island, whose son Alexander, then 21, was a passenger on the flight. The work consists of 43 nude statues of the wives and mothers who lost a husband or a child. Inside each sculpture there is a personal memento of the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dark Elergy|url=http://web.syr.edu/%7Evpaf103/mem_elergy.htm |work=Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014064132/http://web.syr.edu/~vpaf103/mem_elergy.htm |archivedate=14 October 2007 |accessdate=21 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Women of Lockerbie ====
''The Women of Lockerbie'' (2003) is a play written by [[Deborah Brevoort]] which depicts a woman from New Jersey roaming the hills of Lockerbie, Scotland.  This mother tragically lost her son in the bombing of the Pan Am Flight 103.  While in Lockerbie, 7 years after the flight, she meets the women who witnessed and were affected by the crash itself while she attempts to find closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dramatists.com/cgi-bin/db/single.asp?key=3626#|title=Dramatists Play Service, Inc.|website=www.dramatists.com|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This play has received the Silver Medal from the Onassis International Playwriting Competition and the Kennedy Center Fund for New American Plays award. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deborahbrevoort.com/plays/the-women-of-lockerbie/|title=The Women of Lockerbie - Deborah Brevoort|website=www.deborahbrevoort.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lockerbie===
The main UK memorial is at [[Dryfesdale, Dumfries and Galloway|Dryfesdale]] Cemetery about a mile west of Lockerbie. There is a semicircular stone wall in the garden of remembrance with the names and nationalities of all the victims along with individual funeral stones and memorials. Inside the chapel at Dryfesdale there is a book of remembrance. There are memorials in [[Lockerbie]] and [[Moffat]] Roman Catholic churches, where plaques list the names of all 270 victims. In Lockerbie Town Hall Council Chambers, there is a stained-glass window depicting flags of the 21 different countries whose citizens lost their lives in the disaster. There is also a book of remembrance at Lockerbie public library and another at Tundergarth Church.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Susan; Cohen, Daniel (2000).

====Benefit game====
A charity football match was arranged for the benefit of the disaster appeal fund. The game took place at [[Palmerston Park]], the ground of [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]], the nearest senior football club to Lockerbie. Opposition was provided by [[Manchester United]] and managed by [[Alex Ferguson]]. The game took place on 1 March 1989. QoS had several guest players in their side as reflected in their scorers, including goals by [[Roy Aitken]] and [[Fraser Wishart]]. The final score was 6–3 to Manchester United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qosarchive.co.uk/08qanda.htm |title=Queen of the South F.C. archive |publisher=Qosarchive.co.uk |accessdate=25 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wreckage of the aircraft==
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch reassembled a large part of the fuselage from the Boeing jumbo jet to aid with the investigation; this has been retained as evidence and stored in a hangar at [[Farnborough Airport]] since the bombing. It was announced in April 2013 that this part of the aircraft was transferred to a secure location in Dumfries, and that it remains evidence in the ongoing criminal investigation.&lt;ref name="BBC-April-2013"&gt;{{cite news | title = Lockerbie wreckage parts returned to Scotland | date = 25 April 2013 | publisher = BBC | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-22290443 | work = BBC News | accessdate = 25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining wreckage of the Boeing jumbo jet is stored about a mile from [[Tattershall]], Lincolnshire, at Roger Windley's scrapyard, pending the conclusion of the American victims' civil case and further legal proceedings. ({{Coord|53|7|19.35|N|0|12|58.09|W|format=dms|region:GB_scale:5000|name=Windley's Scrapyard}}) The remains include the nose section of the Boeing 747, which was cut into several pieces to assist in removal from Tundergarth Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/5260/latest.html |title=Authentic Pan Am 103 cockpit wreck photo |accessdate=8 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030417063520/http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/5260/latest.html |archivedate=17 April 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7504">The '''political science of religion''' (also referred to as politicology of religion or politology of religion) is one of the youngest disciplines in the [[political science]]s that deals with a study of influence that [[religion]] has on [[politics]] and vice versa with a focus on the relationship between the subjects ([[Actor (policy debate)|actors]]) in politics in the narrow sense: [[government]], [[political parties]], [[pressure group]]s, and [[religious communities]]. It was established in the last decades of the twentieth century.

==Research areas==
The basic research areas of the political science of religion are:
* All aspects of [[religion|religious]] teachings and practices that have direct political contents and messages, such as religious understanding of government, [[Power (sociology)|power]], political [[authority]], [[State (polity)|state]], political organizing, [[war]], [[peace]], etc.;
* All aspects of religious behavior and practice that don’t have direct political contents and messages but do have direct political consequences, such as building of [[Religious architecture|religious edifices]], [[pilgrimage]]s, etc.;
* Attitudes and positions of political subjects in the narrow sense towards religion and religious communities, such as that of [[political party|political parties]] and pressure groups towards religion and religious communities;
* Everything within apparently completely [[secular]] public behavior with no religious motives that causes religious consequences, such as an economic [[monopoly]] achieved by a religious group within a multi-confessional society – it cannot but cause political consequences.

These fields of research are in constant development. The newest area of research in political science of religion is on the subject of religion and international relations.

==History==
The political science of religion or politology of religion was established as an [[academic discipline]] in 1993 at the Faculty of Political Science of the [[University of Belgrade]], [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/eng/pages/p_id1/o_p.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210043816/http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/eng/pages/p_id1/o_p.html |archivedate=2010-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The  founder of this discipline is Dr Miroljub Jevtic; http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/en/undergraduate-studies/political-department/third-year/ . In 2006, [[Georgetown University]] established the [[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] as one of the first American university research centers devoted to issues surrounding the political science of religion.

The ''Politics and Religion Journal'' was founded by the Center for Study of Religion and Religious Tolerance in [[Belgrade, Serbia]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politicsandreligionjournal.com/english/english.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028171212/http://www.politicsandreligionjournal.com/english/english.htm |archivedate=2008-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its ''spiritus movens'' and [[editor in chief]] is [[Miroljub Jevtić]], professor at the Faculty of Political Science, University of Belgrade, Serbia. The journal ''Politics and Religion'', produced by Cambridge Journals, published its first volume in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=RAP Politics and Religion]&lt;/ref&gt;

The political science of religion is studied at almost all universities and political science departments in the United States. The [[American Political Science Association]] has a religion and politics section.&lt;ref&gt;[https://connect.apsanet.org/s11/home/ “Religion and Politics”]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public security''' is the function of governments which ensures the protection of citizens, persons in their territory, organizations, and institutions against threats to their well-being – and to the prosperity of their communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://cradpdf.drdc-rddc.gc.ca/PDFS/unc131/p538238_A1b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

To meet the increasing challenges in the public security area, responsible public institutions and organisations can tap into their own [[intelligence]] to successfully address possible threats in advance. They optimise their internal structures, use synergies, and carefully balance costs and benefits of their measures.

'''Public safety organizations'''  include law enforcement, fire and emergency medical services. The public safety issues a municipality, county, state, or federal jurisdiction might grapple with include narcotic use, trespassing, burglary, harassment, juvenile delinquency, unauthorized living, noise, [[litter]]ing, inappropriate social behavior, inebriation, and other quality of life issues. Generally organizations are involved in the [[Risk prevention|prevention]] of and protection from events that could endanger the [[safety]] of the [[general public]] from significant [[Risk|danger]], injury, or [[property damage]], such as [[crime]]s or  disasters ([[natural disaster|natural]] or human-made).

== Framework ==
[[Organised crime]] and international [[terrorism]] are hardly deterred by geographical, linguistic, or financial barriers. Competence and administrative hurdles play into their hands.

The latter has largely contributed to public security becoming an important political and economic issue, nationally as well as internationally. Politics, public organisations and businesses closely collaborate to guarantee public security and maintain a stable environment for economic prosperity.

Although public security significantly contributes to the attractiveness of a location, the productivity of its people, and hence the overall success of an economy, the sector frequently suffers from low budgets, limited resources, and inadequate information systems. Large events, [[pandemic]]s, severe [[accident]]s, environmental [[disaster]]s, and [[terrorism]] attacks pose additional threats to public security and order.

The police, federal police and border authorities nonetheless need to warrant the security of the country as a fundamental prerequisite for the domestic political ability to act. The quality and scope of potential threats have changed significantly, and the tasks and general framework for the police, federal police and border authorities have changed accordingly.

*Federal agency for technical relief
*Federal [[Criminal Investigation Department|criminal investigation department]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14901">The '''RAND Health Insurance Experiment''' (RAND HIE) was an experimental study of [[health care]] costs, utilization and outcomes in the United States, which assigned people randomly to different kinds of plans and followed their behavior, from 1974 to 1982. Because it was a [[randomized controlled trial]], it provided stronger evidence than the more common [[observational studies]]. It concluded that [[cost sharing]] reduced "inappropriate or unnecessary" medical care ([[overutilization]]), but also reduced "appropriate or needed" medical care. 

==Methods==

The [[RAND]] HIE was begun in 1971 by a group led by health economist [[Joseph Newhouse]] and including health service researchers Robert Brook and John Ware; health economists Willard Manning, Emmett Keeler, Arleen Leibowitz, and Susan Marquis; and statisticians [[Carl Morris (statistician)|Carl Morris]] and [[Naihua Duan]].  The group set out to answer this question (among others): "Does free medical care lead to better health than insurance plans that require the patient to shoulder part of the cost?".&lt;ref&gt;Brook RH, Ware JE, Rogers WH, Keeler EB, Davies AR, Sherbourne CA, et al.

["An earlier version of the present report appeared in the December 8, 1983, issue of ''The New England Journal of Medicine'' (Vol. 309, pp. 1426-1434)."]&lt;/ref&gt;

The team established an [[insurance company]] using funding from the then-[[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]]. The company [[random]]ly assigned 5809 people to insurance plans that either had no cost-sharing, 25%, 50% or 95% [[coinsurance]] rates with a maximum annual payment of $1000.&lt;ref name=Manning1988&gt;Manning WG, Newhouse JP, Duan N, Keeler EB, Benjamin B, Liebowitz A, et al.

["An abridged version of this report... was published in ''The American Economic Review'', June 1987."]&lt;/ref&gt;  It also randomly assigned 1,149 persons to a staff model [[health maintenance organization]] (HMO), the [[Group Health Cooperative|Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound]].&lt;ref name=Manning1985&gt;Manning WG, Liebowitz A, Goldberg GA, Newhouse JP, Rogers WH.

==Findings==

An early paper with interim results from the RAND HIE concluded that health insurance without coinsurance "leads to more people using services and to more services per user," referring to both outpatient and inpatient services.&lt;ref&gt;Newhouse JP, Manning WG, Morris CN, Orr LL, Duan N, Keeler EB, et al. [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/305/25/1501 Some interim results from a controlled trial of cost sharing in health insurance.] N Engl J Med 1981;305:1501-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent RAND HIE publications "rule[d] out all but a minimal influence, favorable or adverse, of free care for the average participant"&lt;ref&gt;Brook RH, Ware JE Jr, Rogers WH, Keeler EB, Davies AR, Donald CA, et al. [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/309/23/1426 Does free care improve adults' health? Results from a randomized controlled trial.] N Engl J Med 1983;309:1426-1434.&lt;/ref&gt; but determined that a "low income initially sick group assigned to the HMO... [had a] greater risk of dying" than those assigned to [[fee-for-service]] (FFS) care.&lt;ref&gt;Ware JE Jr, Brook RH, Rogers WH, Keeler EB, Davies AR, Sherbourne CD, et al.

Brook, Emmett B. Keeler, Kathleen N. Lohr, et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newhouse, summarizing the RAND HIE in 2004, wrote "For most people enrolled in the RAND experiment, who were typical of Americans covered by employment-based insurance, the variation in use across the plans appeared to have minimal to no effects on health status. By contrast, for those who were both poor and sick -- people who might be found among those covered by Medicaid or lacking insurance -- the reduction in use was harmful, on average".&lt;ref&gt;Newhouse JP.

==Criticisms and legacy==

The RAND HIE was criticized in several ways:
* Some authors questioned the generalizability of comparisons of HMO and FFS care since data on the former were based on a "single, relatively small but well-managed" HMO in Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg E. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DE123FF933A15751C0A964958260 Managed care hasn't lived up to its promises.] New York Times 1992 Feb 20.&lt;/ref&gt;
* One 2007 article suggested that the "large number of participants who voluntarily dropped out of the costsharing arms of the experiment" could have invalidated the RAND HIE's findings.&lt;ref&gt;Nyman JA. [http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/32/5/759.pdf American health policy: cracks in the foundation.] J Health Polit Policy Law 2007;32:759-83.&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Newhouse and colleagues described the argument as "implausible".&lt;ref&gt;Newhouse JP, Brook RH, Duan N, Keeler EB, Leibowitz A, Manning WG, et al. [http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/33/2/295 Attrition in the RAND Health Insurance Experiment: a response to Nyman.] J Health Polit Policy Law 2008;33:295-308; discussion 309-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The RAND HIE did not study people without health insurance, so it could not determine how the presence or absence of health insurance affects health.&lt;ref name=Levy&gt;Levy H, Meltzer D. [http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144042 The impact of health insurance on health.] Annu Rev Public Health 2008;29:399-409.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the study opened the way for increased cost-sharing for medical care in the 1980s and 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The RAND HIE is still referenced in the academic literature as a "gold standard" study in research on the effects of health insurance.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; For example, in 2007 RAND researchers reviewed the literature published between 1985 and 2006 on prescription drug cost sharing, which included co-payments, tiering, coinsurance, pharmacy benefit caps or monthly prescription limits, [[Formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]] restrictions, and reference pricing.&lt;ref name=Goldman&gt;Goldman DP, Joyce GF, Zheng Y. [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/298/1/61 Prescription drug cost sharing: associations with medication and medical utilization and spending and health.] JAMA 2007;298:61-69.&lt;/ref&gt; In summarizing 132 articles, they found that the RAND HIE provided the only relevant experimental data; all other studies they reviewed were [[Observational study|observational]].&lt;ref name=Goldman/&gt;  They concluded: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Increased cost sharing is associated with lower rates of drug treatment, worse adherence among existing users, and more frequent discontinuation of therapy. For each 10% increase in cost sharing, prescription drug spending decreases by 2% to 6%, depending on class of drug and condition of the patient. The reduction in use associated with a benefit cap, which limits either the coverage amount or the number of covered prescriptions, is consistent with other cost-sharing features. For some chronic conditions, higher cost sharing is associated with increased use of medical services, at least for patients with congestive heart failure, lipid disorders, diabetes, and schizophrenia. While low-income groups may be more sensitive to increased cost sharing, there is little evidence to support this contention.&lt;ref name=Goldman/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, the RAND HIE is mentioned regularly in the newsmedia, for example:
* "Evidence from the RAND Experiment indicates that most of the expenditure-reducing effects of health-plan deductibles occur at low levels of deductibles."&lt;ref&gt;Cogan JR, Hubbard RG. [http://www.hoover.org/pubaffairs/dailyreport/archive/9828812.html Bringing the market to health care.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706001214/http://www.hoover.org/pubaffairs/dailyreport/archive/9828812.html |date=2008-07-06 }} Wall Street Journal 2007 Sep 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "A classic experiment by Rand researchers from 1974 to 1982 found that people who had to pay almost all of their own medical bills spent 30 percent less on health care than those whose insurance covered all their costs, with little or no difference in health outcomes. The one exception was low-income people in poor health, who went without care they needed."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/opinion/25sun1.html Editorial. The high cost of health care.] New York Times 2007 Nov 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "...the Rand health insurance experiment found that patients cut back equally on both superfluous and necessary visits when asked for small co-payments."&lt;ref&gt;Sanghavi D. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/23/AR2008052302564_pf.html The high price of a medical miracle. If health-care costs are trimmed, who will be deprived of treatment?] Washington Post 2008 May 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oregon Health Study==
{{main article|Oregon Medicaid health experiment}}

In 2008, for reasons of cost, Oregon's Medicaid agency accepted 10,000 uninsured low-income adults into its insurance program based on a lottery with 89,824 applicants. In the Oregon Health Study, Newhouse and others tracked the effects on those who were accepted and rejected. They found that health insurance improved peoples' health and lives generally, but they also spent more money on health care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregonhealthstudy.org/en/home.php Oregon Health Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626141516/http://www.oregonhealthstudy.org/en/home.php |date=2012-06-26 }} Home page&lt;/ref&gt;

According to economist Katherine Baicker, the study "put to rest two incorrect arguments."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/23/health/oregon-study-reveals-benefits-and-costs-of-insuring-the-uninsured.html In Oregon, Test Case for Health Overhaul, Better Care at a Cost], By ANNIE LOWREY, New York Times, June 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

New data regarding the Oregon experiment shows that, while it was effective to reduce out-of-pocket payment by the beneficiaries and increase their financial security, it did not lead to objective improvements in blood sugar, blood pressure, or some other metrics. These findings contradicted the earlier results, which had shown greater effects upon people's health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/05/the-follow-up-study-on-medicaid-coverage-in-oregon.html The follow-up study on Medicaid coverage in Oregon], Last Modified 2013 May 1. Retrieved 2015 Aug 5 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, these results are based on two years of data, and longer follow-up might reveal different results.  The study did indicate a significant improvement in rates of depression in the two-year window. &lt;ref&gt;Medicaid Access Increases Use of Care, Study Finds By ANNIE LOWREY MAY 1, 2013 https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/02/business/study-finds-health-care-use-rises-with-expanded-medicaid.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Walther Darré''', born '''Ricardo Walther Óscar Darré''' (14 July 1895 – 5 September 1953), was one of the leading [[Nazism|Nazi]] "[[Blood and Soil|blood and soil]]" (German: ''Blut und Boden'') ideologists and served as Reich Minister of Food and Agriculture from 1933 to 1942. He was a high-ranking functionary in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and the seventh most senior commander in the organisation.

==Early life==
Darré was born in [[Belgrano, Buenos Aires|Belgrano]],&lt;ref name=Bramwell&gt;''Blood and Soil: Richard Walther Darré and Hitler's 'Green Party'', Anna Bramwell (Kensal Press, 1985, {{ISBN|0-946041-33-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Buenos Aires]] neighbourhood, in [[Argentina]] to Richard Oscar Darré, a German with [[Huguenot]] ancestry (born 10 March 1854, [[Berlin]]; died 20 February 1929, [[Wiesbaden]])&lt;ref name="erziehung"&gt;Richard [Oscar] Darré, ''Meine Erziehung im Elternhause und durch das Leben'', Wiesbaden, 1925&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bramwell gives the middle name as "Oskar".&lt;/ref&gt; and  Emilia Berta Eleonore, née Lagergren (born 23 July 1872 in [[Buenos Aires]] to a [[Swedes|Swedish]]-born father and German-Spanish born mother; died 20 July 1936 in [[Bad Pyrmont]])&lt;ref&gt;An unpublished genealogy, consistent with census information available online, gives Eleonore's parents as Theodor Erik Lagergren, born 1839 in Glömminge, [[Sweden]], and Josefina Margarete Thole, born 1841 in [[Haselünne]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[Germany]].&lt;/ref&gt;. His father moved to [[Argentina]] in 1888 as a partner of the German international import/export wholesaler Engelbert Hardt &amp; Co.&lt;ref name="erziehung"/&gt; Although his parents' marriage was not a happy one (Richard Walther remembered his father as a hard drinker and a womanizer&lt;ref&gt;Letter to his wife Alma as quoted by Bramwell.&lt;/ref&gt;), they lived prosperously, and educated their children privately until they were forced to return to Germany as a result of worsening international relations in the years preceding [[World War I]]. Darré gained fluency in four languages: Spanish, German, English, and French.

Darré's parents sent him to Germany at age nine to attend school in [[Heidelberg]]; in 1911 he attended as an exchange pupil [[King's College School]] in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]]. The rest of the family returned to Germany in 1912. Richard (as he was known in the family) then spent two years at the ''Oberrealschule'' in [[Gummersbach]], followed in early 1914 by the ''Kolonialschule'' for resettlement in the [[German colonial empire|German colonies]] at [[Witzenhausen]], south of [[Göttingen]], which awakened his interest in farming.

After a single term at Witzenhausen, he volunteered for army service. He was lightly wounded a number of times while serving during [[World War I]], but fared better than most of his contemporaries.

When the war ended he contemplated returning to Argentina for a life of farming, but the family's weakening financial position during the years of inflation made this impossible. Instead he returned to Witzenhausen to continue his studies. He then obtained unpaid work as a farm assistant in [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Pomerania]]: his observation of the treatment of returning German soldiers there influenced his later writings.

In 1922 he moved to the [[University of Halle]] to continue his studies: here he took an agricultural degree, specialising in animal breeding. He did not complete his PhD studies until 1929, at the comparatively mature age of 34. During these years he spent some time working in [[East Prussia]] and [[Finland]].

He married twice. In 1922 he married Alma Staadt,&lt;ref&gt;Full name Alberta Helene Theresa Alma Staadt; date of marriage 29 April 1922: see catalog of archive materials held by the Munich Archives relating to Alma Darré available at http://www.ifz-muenchen.de/archiv/ed_0916.pdf (consulted 18 Jan 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; a schoolfriend of his sister Ilse. He divorced Alma in 1927, and subsequently married Charlotte Freiin von Vittinghoff-Schell, who survived him. The first marriage produced two daughters.

==Political awakening==
As a young man in Germany, Darré initially joined the [[Artaman League]], a ''[[Völkisch movement|Völkisch]]'' youth-group committed to the [[back-to-the-land movement]].&lt;ref name="pringle40"&gt;
[[Heather Pringle]], ''The Master Plan:  Himmler's Scholars and the Holocaust'', p40 {{ISBN|0-7868-6886-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context he began to develop the idea of the linkage between the future of the [[Nordic race]] and the soil: the tendency which became known as "''[[Blut und Boden]]''". Here "Blut" (blood) represents race or ancestry, while "Boden" expresses the concepts of soil, territory, or land. The essence of the theory involved the mutual and long-term relationship between a people and the land that it occupies and cultivates.

Darré's first political article (1926) discussed ''Internal Colonisation'' and argued against Germany attempting to regain the lost colonies in Africa. Most of his writing at this time, however, concentrated on technical aspects of animal breeding. He wrote his first book, ''Das Bauerntum als Lebensquell der nordischen Rasse'' ('Peasantry as the life-source of the Nordic Race'), in 1928.&lt;ref name="before103"&gt;Barbara Miller Lane, Leila J. Rupp, ''Nazi Ideology Before 1933: A Documentation'' p. 103 {{ISBN|0-292-75512-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; It asserted that German farms had previously been bestowed on one son, the strongest, ensuring the best were farmers, but partible inheritance had destroyed that.&lt;ref name="pringle40"/&gt; Darré demanded the restoration of the ancient tradition, as well as serious efforts to restore the purity of Nordic blood, including exterminating the sick and impure.&lt;ref name="pringle40"/&gt;

In her biography of Darré, Anna Bramwell interprets his writing as an early example of "[[Green Politics|Green]]" or Conservationist thinking: he advocated more natural methods of land management, placing emphasis on the conservation of forests, and demanded more open-space and air in the raising of farm animals.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Other scholars, however, have challenged this view. One sees Bramwell's books as "devoid of credible evidence" and containing "gross errors".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book 
|title=The green and the brown: a history of conservation in Nazi Germany|first=Frank |last=Uekötter
|publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006
|isbn=9780521612777
|page=202
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q-LavK2QaMcC&amp;pg=PA203 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Another acknowledges Bramwell's biography as "undoubtedly the best single source on Darré in either German or English" while at the same time saying that she "consistently downplays the virulently fascist elements in his thinking, portraying him instead as a misguided agrarian radical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascist Ecology: The "Green Wing" of the Nazi Party and its Historical Antecedents|author=Peter Staudenmaier|publisher=A.K.

Those who heard and heeded Darré's arguments included [[Heinrich Himmler]], himself one of the Artamans.&lt;ref name="pringle40"/&gt;

Darré's work also glorified "peasant virtues" – as found in the remnants of the Nordics who lived in the country – and disparaged city living.&lt;ref name="before103"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In his two major works, he defined the German peasantry as a homogeneous racial group of Nordic antecedents, who formed the cultural and racial core of the German nation. [..] Since the Nordic birth-rate was lower than that of other races, the Nordic race was under a long-term threat of extinction.&lt;ref name=Bramwell/&gt;{{Rp|55}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==As a Nazi Party member==
In July 1930, after [[Paul Schultze-Naumburg]] had introduced him to [[Adolf Hitler]], Darré joined the [[Nazi Party]] and the ''[[Schutzstaffel|SS]]''. Darré's NSDAP number was 248,256 and his SS number was 6,882.&lt;ref&gt;Biondi, Robert, ed., ''SS Officers List: SS-Standartenführer to SS-Oberstgruppenführer'' (As of 30 January 1942), Schiffer Military History Publishing, 2000, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Darré went on to become an active Nazi ''[[Reichsleiter]]'' and to set up an agrarian political apparatus to recruit farmers into the party. Darré saw three main roles for this apparatus: to exploit unrest in the countryside as a weapon against the urban government; to win over the peasants as staunch Nazi supporters; to gain a constituency of people who could be used as settlers to displace the [[Slavs]] in future conquests in the East. The German historian [[Klaus Hildebrand]] described Darré together with Himmler and [[Alfred Rosenberg]] as one of the leaders of the "agrarian" fraction within the NSDAP who championed anti-industrial and anti-urban "blood and soil" ideology, expansion into Eastern Europe to win ''[[Lebensraum]]'', an alliance with Great Britain to defeat the Soviet Union, and staunch opposition to restoring the pre-1914 German colonial empire.&lt;ref name="Hildebrand, Klaus page 18"&gt;Hildebrand, Klaus ''The Foreign Policy of the Third Reich'', B.T. Batsford Ltd: London, United Kingdom, 1973 page 18&lt;/ref&gt; The "agrarian" fraction took the view that Wilhelmine imperialism had taken Germany in the wrong direction by colonizing lands that were unsuitable for mass colonization by German settlers and had unwisely antagonized Britain.&lt;ref name="Hildebrand, Klaus page 18"/&gt; The lesson that the Nazi "agrarians" drew from the Second Reich was that Germany must restrict its ambitions to the continent of Europe in order to win an alliance with Britain and land suitable for German colonization.&lt;ref name="Hildebrand, Klaus page 18"/&gt; On 1 January 1932, ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' Himmler appointed him chief of the newly established [[SS-Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt|SS Race and Settlement Main Office]] (''Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt'' or RuSHA), a racist and [[antisemitic]] organization. Darré was given the rank of SS-''[[Gruppenführer]]''. The RuSHA was a department which implemented racial policies and was concerned with the racial integrity of the members of the SS.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=23, 36}}

During the 1932 presidential election, Darré engaged in a campaign of anti-Semitic harassment against [[Theodor Duesterberg]], the candidate of the conservative [[German National People's Party]], who it emerged during the campaign was the grandson of a Jewish convert to Lutheranism.&lt;ref name="[[Wolfram Wette|Wette, Wolfram]] The Wehrmacht page 65"&gt;Wette, Wolfram The Wehrmacht, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2006 page 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Duesterberg was so wounded by Darré's attacks that he challenged him to a duel, a challenge that Darré declined under the grounds that it was  beneath him to fight a man with "Jewish blood".&lt;ref name="[[Wolfram Wette|Wette, Wolfram]] The Wehrmacht page 65" /&gt; Duesterberg then took up his dispute with Darré before the court of honor of the Former Officers of the 1st Hanoverian Field Artillery Regiment of Scharnhorst, number 10 to which Darré belonged to.&lt;ref name="[[Wolfram Wette|Wette, Wolfram]] The Wehrmacht page 65" /&gt; The court of honor ruled in Darré's favor.&lt;ref name="[[Wolfram Wette|Wette, Wolfram]] The Wehrmacht page 65" /&gt;

In his religious views, Dárre would belong to the Pagan faction within the Nazi movement (see: [[Religious aspects of Nazism]]); however, unlike [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Alfred Rosenberg]], he has not become a figure of interest in the speculation about [[Nazi occultism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hakl, H. T. ''Nationalsozialismus und Okkultismus''. {{de icon}} In: Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke: Die okkulten Wurzeln des Nationalsozialismus. Graz, Austria: Stocker (German edition of [[The Occult Roots of Nazism]], 1997, p. 197). An English translation of this essay is available.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H1215-503-009, Walther Darré bei einer Kundgebung.jpg|thumb|Darré speaking at a ''Reichsnährstand'' assembly under the slogan '[[Blut und Boden]]' (blood and soil) in [[Goslar]], 1937]]
Darré's works were primarily concerned with the ancient and present Nordic peasantry (the ideology of [[Blood and soil]]): within this context, he made an explicit attack against Christianity. In his two main works (''Das Bauerntum als Lebensquell der Nordischen Rasse'', Munich, 1927 and ''Neuadel aus Blut und Boden'', Munich, 1930), Darré accused Christianity, with its "teaching of the equality of men before God," of having "deprived the Teutonic nobility of its moral foundations", the "innate sense of superiority over the nomadic tribes".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Steigmann-Gall|Steigmann-Gall, Richard]], ''The Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity, 1919–1945'', 2003, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the Nazis [[Machtergreifung|came to power]] in 1933, Darré was initially excluded from the Cabinet. However, in June 1933, shortly after the Nazis seized full power, he became Reich Minister of Food and Agriculture, succeeding [[German National People's Party|DNVP]] leader [[Alfred Hugenberg]], who had resigned. He was also named ''Reichsbauernführer'' (usually translated as Reich Peasant Leader, though the word ''Bauer'' also denotes Farmer). Darré was one of the few Nazi ministers who knew his field well.&lt;ref name="RiseFall"&gt;William Shirer, ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'' Touchstone Edition, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  He was instrumental in founding the Nazi ''[[Reichsnährstand]]'' corporation&lt;ref name=Lovin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lovin|first=Clifford R.|title=Agricultural Reorganization in the Third Reich: The Reich Food Corporation (Reichsnahrstand), 1933–1936|journal=Agricultural History|date=October 1969|volume=43:4|pages=447–461}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' process. Darré campaigned for big landowners to part with some of their land to create new farms, and promoted the controversial [[Reichserbhofgesetz]].  He also converted most of the country's small farms into hereditary estates that were to be passed from father to son under the ancient laws of [[fee tail|entailment]].  While this protected small farmers from foreclosure and many other modern financial problems, it also tied them and their descendants to the soil to the end of time.

He developed a plan for ''"Rasse und Raum"'' ("race and space", or territory) which provided the ideological background for the Nazi expansive policy on behalf of the ''"[[Drang nach Osten]]''" ("Drive to the east") and of the "''[[Lebensraum]]''" ("Living space") theory expounded in ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. Darré strongly influenced Himmler in his goal to create a German racial aristocracy based on selective breeding. The [[Nazi eugenics|Nazi policies of eugenics]] would lead to the annihilation of millions of non-Germans. In the course of the preparations for the ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'', Himmler would later break with Darré, whom he saw as too theoretical. Darré was generally on bad terms with Economy Minister [[Hjalmar Schacht]], particularly as Germany suffered poor harvests in the mid 1930s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

By September 1938, Himmler was already demanding that Darré step down as leader of the RuSHA in favour of [[Günther Pancke]]. Darré finally had to resign as Reich Minister in 1942, ostensibly on health grounds, and was succeeded by his state secretary [[Herbert Backe]].

The transcript of a 1940 speech supposedly given by Darré was published in ''[[Life magazine]]'', 9 December 1940: "by blitzkrieg ... before autumn ... we shall be the absolute masters of two continents... a new aristocracy of German masters will be created [with] slaves assigned to it, these slaves to be their property and to consist of landless, non-German nationals.... we actually have in mind a modern form of medieval slavery which we must and will introduce because we urgently need it in order to fulfill our great tasks. These slaves will by no means be denied the blessings of illiteracy; higher education will, in future, be reserved only for the German population of Europe...."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QUoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Secret Nazi Speech: Reich Minister Darré discusses the world's future under German rule"], Richard-Walther Darré, ''Life'', 9 December 1940 ([[Ginger Rogers]] cover), pp. 43–44. 'Life' suggested a lack of confidence in the veracity of their report with the comment "Even if [this address] was not delivered exactly as recorded here, it might have been"&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the war==
In 1945, the American authorities arrested Darré at [[Flak-Kaserne Ludwigsburg]] and tried him at the subsequent [[Nuremberg Trials]] as one of 21 defendants in the [[Ministries Trial]], also known as the Wilhelmstrasse Trial (1947–1949).&lt;ref name="nuernberg"&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/captured-german-records/microfilm/m897.pdf "Records of the United States Nuernberg War Crimes Trials: United States of America v. Ernst Von Weizsaecker et al (Case XI). December 20, 1947 – April 14, 1949."]. US Government archives&lt;/ref&gt;

He was charged under the following counts:&lt;ref name="nuernberg"/&gt;

* Count I: participation in the planning, preparation, initiation, and waging of wars of aggression and invasion of other countries. Found not guilty.
* Count II: conspiracy to commit crimes against peace and crimes against humanity: The count was dismissed, the tribunal finding that no evidence was offered.
* Count IV: crimes against humanity, relating to offenses committed against German nationals from 1933 to 1939. The count was dismissed upon the arguments of defense counsel.
* Count V: atrocities and offenses committed against civilian populations between 1938 and 1945. Found guilty.
* Count VI: plunder and spoliation. Found guilty.
* Count VII: slave labor. Found not guilty.
* Count VIII: membership of criminal organizations. Found guilty.

Darré was sentenced to seven years at [[Landsberg Prison]]. He was released in 1950 and spent his final years in [[Bad Harzburg]]. He died in a [[Munich]] hospital, on 5 September 1953, of [[liver cancer]]. Darré is buried in [[Goslar]].

==Works==
His two main writings were ''Das Bauerntum als Lebensquell der nordischen Rasse'' (1928) and ''Neuadel aus Blut und Boden'' (1930), translated into English as "The Peasantry as Life Source of the Nordic Race" and "A New Nobility of Blood and Soil" respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7979">'''Robert Edward Edmondson''' (1872 in [[Dayton, Ohio]] &amp;ndash; 1959) was an [[anti-Jewish]] [[pamphleteer]] and a defendant in the [[Great Sedition Trial of 1944]]. He was an organizer of the Pan-Aryan Conference.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Berlin Observer (US military occupation paper), May 31, 1946&lt;/ref&gt; Edmondson had roots that went back to the colonial days of Virginia and Maryland and was primarily of Scottish descent. He saw himself as a nonpartisan patriot and referred to himself as a "Native American".

==Career==
Edmondson had a 40-year career as a reporter, editor, author and publisher on economics. He began his career as a journalist in Cincinnati, Ohio working as a reporter for [[The Cincinnati Post|the Cincinnati ''Post'']]. Later he moved to New York City and became a financial reporter for the New York Herald and the ''New York Mail and Express''. While in New York he became aware of what he came to believe was the Jewish manipulation of America’s economy and started an independent financial news outlet, the Edmondson Economic Service.&lt;ref&gt;Guide to the Hollis Godfrey papers&lt;/ref&gt; At this time he also became friendly with Nazi propagandist [[Ulrich Fleischhauer]] and was a participant in the latter's ''Welt-Dienst/World-Service'' anti-Jewish news service.

Edmondson believed President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to be [[Jewish]] and published the flier ''Roosevelt’s Jewish Ancestry'' to make his case. His attacks on Roosevelt during the [[United States presidential election, 1936|1936 election campaign]] suggested that the President was under the control of Jews such as [[Bernard Baruch]], [[Felix Frankfurter]] and [[Louis Brandeis]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry L. Feingold, ''A Time for Searching'', 1995, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of essays called ''American Vigilante Bulletins'' which eventually numbered over 400,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Roy Carlson]], ''Under Cover'', p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Edmondson in the 1930s and 1940s documented what he saw as the Jewish control of America in banking, the press and the media. His research&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; was the forerunner to ''Who Rules America?'' written and distributed decades later by Dr. [[William L. Pierce]]. In 1953 he republished some of his bulletins in a book, ''I Testify''.

Edmondson was also a strong [[anti-communist]] and much of his writing centered around the idea that [[fluoride]] in water was part of a [[communism|communist]] conspiracy, as well as other plots attributed to communists.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Toch, ''The Social Psychology of Social Movements'', p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trials==
On June 11, 1936 Edmondson was indicted by a Grand Jury in New York City and charged with "libeling all persons of the Jewish Religion." In preparing his defense Edmondson subpoenaed some of the most prominent Jews of the time, including: Bernard Buruch, Henry Morgenthau, Rabbi Wise, Samuel Untermeyer, Mayor LaGuardia, James P. Warburg, Walter Lippmann and Justice Samuel Rosenman. In response, the [[American Jewish Committee]] petitioned the court to drop the charges against Edmondson. On May 10, 1938 the judge dismissed all indictments, ruling that there is no group libel law.

In the early 1940s Edmondson was again indicted for his anti-Semitism along with 29 others on charges of sedition. The [[Great Sedition Trial of 1944]], as it became known, was eventually declared a mistrial and the charges were later dismissed. He was widely believed by U.S. intelligence to have been an agent for [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Nian-Sheng Huang, ''Benjamin Franklin in American thought and culture, 1790&amp;ndash;1990'', 1994, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

From New York City Edmondson moved to Stoddartsville, Pennsylvania and later to Grass Valley, California.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Under Cover'', p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edmondson on the Jews==
The following quote expresses his ideology:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am not against Jews because of their religion, as a race, a people or as individuals, but because Jewish leadership [i.e., the bankers] is actively anti-American, is attempting to jettison the American political philosophy and take over the Country, and that I would continue to be anti-Jewish until Jewry repudiated such subversion. Were the offender any other than the Jewish minority, my attitude would be precisely the same. This problem is the biggest and most acute thing in the world today...

Knowing that pitiless publicity is the only cure for public evils, in 1934 I started on a campaign to expose Jewish Anti-Americanism and Talmudic Communism which has been called the "Code of Hell": a "Rabbi Racket" that victimizes its own followers; an international "Satanic System" subverting France, Britain, Germany and Russia, causing the present depression and moving to take over the United States through the Jewish Radical administration [of FDR.]&lt;ref&gt;Robert Edmondson "Testified Against the Jews"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Post-death controversy==
Edmondson died aged 86 in 1959. Following his death his local paper, ''[[The Bulletin (Bend)|The Bend Bulletin]]'', was at the center of controversy amongst his followers who launched a concerted letter writing and pamphleteering campaign as far right leaders attacked the paper for an editorial that was highly critical of Edmondson.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Toch, ''The Social Psychology of Social Movements'', pp. 667&amp;ndash;68.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4427">The '''Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award''' was created by the [[Robert F. Kennedy]] Memorial in 1984, now known as the [[Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights]] to honour individuals around the world who show courage and have made a significant contribution to human rights in their country.

In addition to receiving a financial award, laureates can partner with the RFK Center on projects to advance their human rights work, benefiting from the resources and technologies at the [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation]]'s disposal. Some have achieved their goals, some are in exile from their home country. The majority continue to live in their home country and work with the support of the center to establish the human rights they are working for.

Since 1984, awards have been given to 37 individuals &amp; organizations, from 24 different countries.

{{nihongo|'''Sanzō Nosaka'''|野坂 参三|Nosaka Sanzō|March 30, 1892 &amp;ndash; November 14, 1993}} was a founder of the [[Japanese Communist Party]] (JCP) who worked for periods as a writer, editor, labor organizer, communist agent, politician, and university professor. He was the son of a wealthy Japanese merchant, and attended the prestigious [[Keio University]].  While in university, Nosaka became interested in social movements, and joined a moderate labor organization after graduation, working as a research staff member, and as a writer and editor of the organization's magazine.  He traveled to Britain in 1919 to study [[political economy]], where he deepened his studies of [[Marxism]] and became a confirmed [[communist]]. Nosaka was a founding member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], but his activity within British communist circles led to him being deported from Britain in 1921.&lt;ref name="Scal45" /&gt;

After leaving Britain, Nosaka traveled through the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR).  He returned to Japan in 1922, where he co-founded the [[Japanese Communist Party]] (JCP).&lt;ref name="Scal5" /&gt; Nosaka became a labor organizer, but was arrested twice by the Japanese government for his activities. After being released from prison a second time, Nosaka secretly returned to the USSR in 1931, where he became an agent of the [[Comintern]]. He traveled to the [[West Coast of the United States]], where he worked as a communist spy from 1934-1938.&lt;ref name="Spy" /&gt;

After leaving the United States, Nosaka worked in China from 1940–1945, supporting the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) by encouraging and recruiting captured Japanese soldiers to support and fight for the Chinese communists against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], and coordinating a spy network that operated throughout [[Second Sino-Japanese War#Course of the war|Japanese-occupied China]].  After the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945, Nosaka returned to Japan with hundreds of other Japanese communists, where he led the Japanese Communist Party during the [[American occupation of Japan|occupation of Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillin and Etter pp. 511-512&lt;/ref&gt;

Nosaka attempted to brand the JCP as a populist party supporting Japan's peaceful transition into [[socialism]], but his strategy was criticized within the party and within the Soviet Union. During the [[Korean War]] the JCP temporarily endorsed violence, and Nosaka disappeared from public life and went underground.&lt;ref name="Universalium"&gt;Universalium&lt;/ref&gt; He re-emerged to lead the JCP again in 1955, after which he attempted to disrupt the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|US-Japan Security Treaty]] by organizing public demonstrations, but he generally supported the JCP's role as a peaceful party.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor pp. iv, 13-14, 19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958 Nosaka became Chairman of the JCP, a position he held until retirement at the age of 90, after which he was declared Honorary Chairman. Nosaka joined the faculty of [[Keio University]], and he was widely idolized among left-wing intellectuals until shortly before his death, when the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] exposed controversial aspects of his relationship with [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s Communist regime.&lt;ref name="Kirkup"&gt;Kirkup&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Sanzō Nosaka was the son of a prosperous Japanese merchant and was raised in a [[bourgeois]] environment. As a young man Nosaka was known for his fashionable taste in clothing and for the large dog that often accompanied him in public. He was quiet, serious, studious, introverted, and more comfortable in libraries than at public demonstrations. After his secondary education, Nosaka attended [[Keio University]], which was then considered a "rich boys school".  At Keio, Nosaka became interested in the international labor movement, an interest that was largely supported by one of his professors, Kiichi Horie. Nosaka decided to write his senior thesis on the moderate labor organization founded by [[Bunji Suzuki]], "''Yuaikai''" ("The Friendly Society"). To research his thesis, Nosaka contacted ''Yuaikai'''s head office, and acquainted himself with its senior leaders: Suzuki initially mistook Nosaka for a salesman the first time they met, but eventually grew fond of Nosaka. When Nosaka graduated from Keio, in 1915, he joined ''Yuaikai'' and worked for the organization as a research staff member and as an editor of the organization's journal, ''Rodo Oyobi Sangyo'' (''Labour and Industry'').&lt;ref name="Scal4"&gt;Scalapino p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Nosaka became interested in communism after the 1917 [[Bolshevik Revolution]].&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt;  As a greater volume of leftist literature entered Japan from the West, Nosaka's political orientation moved farther from the center. The first Western texts on revolutionary social theory available in Japan were mostly on [[anarchism]], but Nosaka also enjoyed [[Edward Bellamy]]'s utopian novel, ''[[Looking Backward]]''. In 1918-1919 Nosaka read an English copy of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' brought to Japan by his friend, Shinzo Koizumi. After reading ''The Communist Manifesto'', Nosaka embraced the theories of [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name="Scal45"&gt;Scalapino pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Nosaka announced his intentions to go abroad to study social theory in the November 1918 issue of ''Rodo Oyobi Sangyo''. He sailed out of [[Kobe]] harbor in July 7, 1919, and arrived in London on August 27. After his arrival, Nosaka studied [[political economy]] at [[London University]]. Like many British intellectuals at the time, Nosaka deepened his studies of Marxism, and became a confirmed communist at the university.&lt;ref name="Kirkup" /&gt; While in London Nosaka became active in communist circles. He affiliated himself with notable trade union leaders active in London, and attended the September 8–13, 1919 Glasgow Trade Union Congress as a correspondent for ''Rodo Oyobi Sangyo''.&lt;ref name="Scal5"&gt;Scalapino p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Nosaka was a founding member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] in 1920,&lt;ref name="Pace"&gt;Pace&lt;/ref&gt; and attended the Party's first session as a representative from London. Nosaka's activities within the Communist Party brought him to the attention of [[Scotland Yard]],&lt;ref name="Scal5" /&gt; and Nosaka was deported from Britain in 1921. After he left Britain, Nosaka traveled through Europe to the newly formed [[Soviet Union]]. In Russia, with the help of friendly contacts in the communist hierarchy, Nosaka became influential within the Communist Party. Nosaka was suspected of being either a British or Japanese agent; but, because of his contacts among high-ranking Finnish and Russian leaders, Nosaka was never [[purged]].&lt;ref name="Kirkup" /&gt; Nosaka wrote A Brief Review of the Labour Movement in Japan. It was published by the International Council of Trade and Industrial Unions in 1921&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A Brief Review of the Labour Movement in Japan|author= Sanzo Nosaka|publisher= The International Council of Trade and Industrial Unions|year= 1921|pages= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After attending the Far Eastern People's Conference in the Soviet Union, Nosaka returned to Japan in 1922,&lt;ref name="Scal5" /&gt; and helped found the [[Japanese Communist Party]] (JCP) that same year.&lt;ref name="Pace" /&gt; Nosaka was more secretive about his relationship with the Communist Party than he had been in Britain, and kept his membership a secret from Bunji Suzuki and other moderate labour leaders.&lt;ref name="Scal5" /&gt; After his return, Nosaka worked as a trade unionist and editor of the JCP's official newspaper, ''Musansha Shimbun''.&lt;ref name="Universalium" /&gt;

Because of his activities within the Communist Party (which was illegal in Japan),&lt;ref&gt;Scalapino p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Nosaka, like many communists in Japan, was arrested (twice in his case),&lt;ref name="Universalium" /&gt; interrogated, and tortured by the Japanese [[kempeitai]], but he was released after short periods both times. Nosaka was first arrested in 1923, and released within a year. After his release, Nosaka became more active within the Japanese labor movement.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; In March 1928, the Japanese police began a campaign to harass and destroy the JCP,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with the [[May 15 Incident]].&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; After his second arrest in 1929, Nosaka spent two years in jail. He was released in 1931 on the grounds of illness.&lt;ref name="Spy"&gt;''The Japan Times Online''&lt;/ref&gt; The short lengths of Nosaka's arrests aroused suspicion among other Japanese communists that Nosaka had given important information to the Japanese secret police, but these suspicions were never acted upon.&lt;ref name="Kirkup" /&gt;

===Comintern agent===
Upon his release, Nosaka secretly returned to the Soviet Union, arriving in [[Moscow]] in March 1931.&lt;ref name="Scal42"&gt;Scalapino p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; While there, Nosaka served as a representative of the JCP,&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; and worked as an executive member of the [[Comintern]].&lt;ref name="Universalium" /&gt; While in Moscow Nosaka helped to draft the "1932 Thesis", which became the guiding document of the JCP until 1946. Most of his colleagues active in the JCP, who were not able to go abroad, were subsequently arrested by the kempeitai by the fall of 1932.&lt;ref name="Scal42" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ariyoshi, Beechert, and Beechert p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Nosaka's friends was [[Kenzo Yamamoto]], a legendary Japanese communist who had been in the Soviet Union with his common-law wife, Matsu, since 1928.&lt;ref name="Pace" /&gt; Yamamoto had a reputation as a great womanizer; and, when rumors circulated that Yamamoto was engaged in an affair with Nosaka's wife, Ryu, Nosaka wrote a confidential letter to the [[KGB]] (dated February 22, 1939) indicating that he believed Yamamoto and his wife were likely Japanese spies in the pay of the [[kempeitai]]. On Stalin's orders, both Yamamoto and Matsu were arrested as spies. A firing squad executed Yamamoto, and Matsu died in a [[gulag]].  Both Yamamoto and his wife were formally rehabilitated after their deaths by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] on May 23, 1956, recognizing the lack of any evidence that the two were actually spies.&lt;ref name="Kirkup" /&gt; In his autobiography, Nosaka later wrote that he had tried to save Yamamoto's life.&lt;ref name="Pace" /&gt;

In 1934, Nosaka secretly traveled to the [[West Coast of the United States]], where he became involved in [[Human intelligence (espionage)|intelligence]] work on behalf of the [[International Liaison Department (Comintern)|International Liaison Department]] of the [[Comintern]] against the [[Imperial Japan]]ese government.  Nosaka's activities included disseminating information to communists still active in Japan, infiltrating and making contact with the Japanese communities active in the United States, and establishing a number of communist front organizations in [[Seattle]], [[Los Angeles]], and other cities on the West Coast. Nosaka worked to gain funding from the Comintern for his activities, and attempted to have other Japanese Communists secretly relocated to America. He planned to recruit American and Japanese agents to send  to [[Yokohama]] to establish a cell that would  operate as a communist front organization.  Because the records from this period are incomplete, historians cannot be certain to what extent Nosaka's efforts in America were successful. Nosaka worked as a Comintern agent in America until 1938, when he returned to Moscow. In 1940, the Comintern ordered Nosaka to aid communist forces in China.&lt;ref name="Spy" /&gt;

In May 1943, Nosaka was the representative of the JCP in the case of the dissolution of the Comintern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern|publisher= Hoover Press|author= Milorad M. Drachkovitch |year= 1986|pages= 342–343| isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities in China==

[[File:Nosaka Sanzo at the Seventh Congress of the Communist Party of China.jpg|thumbnail|Nosaka (middle) and [[Mao Zedong]] (right) at the Seventh Congress of the Communist Party of China]]
From March 1940 to the end of 1945, during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Nosaka resided at the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese Red Army]] base in [[Yan'an]], in [[Shaanxi]] Province, where he headed the [[Japanese People's Emancipation League]] (JPEL). The JPEL engaged in the "[[Mind control|re-education]]" of numerous Japanese [[prisoners of war]] (POWs) and created [[propaganda]] on behalf of the Chinese Communists. Japanese troops captured by the Communists were then used by the Communists in various civilian and military roles, and were especially valued because their level of technical expertise was generally greater than that of most Chinese soldiers. "Re-educated" Japanese troops were instrumental in a number of Communist victories after World War II, including the 1949 [[Pingjin Campaign]], in which most of the artillery fielded by the Communists was manned by Japanese gunners. In general, the method of "re-education" devised and employed by Nosaka was highly effective.&lt;ref&gt;Gillin and Etter p. 511&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the Red Army was a purely [[guerrilla]] force without the facilities to imprison POWs.  The policy of the [[Eighth Route Army]], the main communist force active during World War II, was to interrogate prisoners and then release them.  After reports surfaced that the Japanese were punishing Japanese prisoners after they returned, the Red Army's policy gradually changed to one of retraining POWs, and the communists began to implement this policy after Nosaka arrived in Yan'an.&lt;ref name="Inoue"&gt;Inoue&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of its war with China, the Japanese army was educating its officers and common soldiers to die rather than surrender. Injured soldiers were easily captured, and made up the bulk of Japanese POWs.  Captured Japanese believed that they would be killed, but were instead fed and clothed, and began to develop a rapport with their captors.&lt;ref name="Inoue" /&gt;

Besides Nosaka's regimen of psychological indoctrination, there were several reasons that Japanese POWs chose to join the Chinese communists. Communist guerrillas took care to develop an early rapport with their prisoners by treating them well. Captured Japanese soldiers were generally moved when they learned of the terrible conditions the war inflicted on the Chinese people, a perspective that they had not been exposed to before their capture. Closer to the end of  the war, the growing possibility of defeat created anxiety among the Japanese army. Because of the Japanese military's policy to never surrender, Japanese soldiers never received any training about how to act as POWs: upon returning to Japanese ranks, many would face disgrace, punishment, and starvation. Many Japanese soldiers committed suicide after their capture, but those who chose to live generally came to sympathize with the Chinese. The Japanese army was aware of the existence of Nosaka's Communist Japanese soldiers, and feared the phenomena out of proportion to their actual threat.&lt;ref name="Inoue" /&gt; [[Koji Ariyoshi]], an American who met Nosaka in Yan'an wrote that Nosaka was "the Japanese national who undoubtedly contributed the most in the war against Japanese militarism". The Japanese army attempted to use numerous spies and assassins in order to eliminate Nosaka (who used the name "Okano Susumu" for the duration of the war), but were unsuccessful. Nosaka maintained a network of agents throughout Japanese-occupied China, which he used to gather information about events within the Japanese Empire and about the war.&lt;ref&gt;Ariyoshi, Beechert, and Beechert pp. 123–125&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1940 to 1943, Nosaka's presence in China was kept a secret. Under a Chinese name, Lin Zhe, he directed the work of the Research Office of the Japanese Problem. His work with the Research Office in Yan'an brought Yan'an's intelligence information about Japan up to date. Nosaka collected newspapers and other publications from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= A Partnership for Disorder: China, the United States, and Their Policies for the Postwar Disposition of the Japanese Empire, 1941-1945| publisher= | author= Page, Xiaoyuan Liu| year= | page= 170–173| isbn=}} &lt;/ref&gt; To research the enemy, Nosaka and his crew took care to analyze current events in Japan and China, which they did by stocking Japanese newspapers, magazines, journals, and diaries that were purchased or seized on the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= The Thought War: Japanese Imperial Propaganda | publisher=  | author= Kushner, Barak | year= | page= 137, 141–143 | isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nosaka's Japanese "prisoner converts" fought freely for the Chinese communists once their re-education was complete. In Yan'an, the Japanese lived normal lives without guards, owned a cooperative store, and printed their own news bulletins and propaganda.  Visiting American officers used Nosaka's Japanese soldiers to critique and improve their own methods of anti-Japanese psychological warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Ariyoshi, Beechert, and Beechert p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Japan's surrender in 1945, Nosaka began to march with approximately 200 other Japanese Communists across northern China.  They arrived at the coast after picking up hundreds of other Japanese along the way. Demanding immediate repatriation from the first Americans they found, they declared their intention to return and work "for the democratization of Japan and the establishment of peace in the Far East".  Although there are no records of the exact number of Japanese "re-educated" by Nosaka who elected to remain in Communist-occupied China after 1945, it is estimated that "the number must have been considerable".&lt;ref&gt;Gillin and Etter p. 512&lt;/ref&gt;

Nosaka's contributions to the eventual victory of the Red Army were not forgotten by the leaders he had worked with in China. In 1965, on the twentieth anniversary of Japan's defeat, Nosaka was publicly praised by name by the highest-ranking general in China at the time, [[Lin Biao]].&lt;ref&gt;Lin&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar==
===Japanese political career===
[[File:Communist Returns to Japan.png|thumbnail|Sanzō Nosaka speaking to large crowd in Tokyo (ca. 1946)]]
After the World War II, Nosaka's return to Japan was facilitated by [[E. Herbert Norman]], the Canadian representative to the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]], who may also have been a Soviet spy. Before returning to Japan, Nosaka gained Stalin's endorsement for the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party. Nosaka's re-entry to Japan was also aided by the American diplomat [[John S. Service]],&lt;ref&gt;Miwa and Ramseyer 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; who had a history of being friendly to Chinese Communists.&lt;ref&gt;Kifner&lt;/ref&gt; Before returning to Japan, Nosaka advised [[Joseph Stalin]] to retain the position of the [[Japanese Emperor]], but to replace Emperor [[Hirohito]] with Crown Prince [[Akihito]] if the Communists ever gained control of Japan.&lt;ref name="Kirkup" /&gt; 

Nosaka returned to Japan in January 1946, and received a hero's welcome by the JCP.&lt;ref name="Taylor3"&gt;Taylor p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to China as a recognized protege of [[Mao Zedong]], and enjoyed the informal recognition as a "roving ambassador" for Japanese communism. After his return to Japan, Nosaka worked to organize Japanese communists. In the general elections of 1946, he and four other members of the JCP were elected to the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]], and the party received 4% of the popular vote.&lt;ref name="Taylor3"&gt;Taylor p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The JCP made progress infiltrating Japanese labor associations and socialist parties; and, in the general elections of 1949, the JCP gained 10% of the popular vote. In May 1950, shortly after the United States entered the [[Korean War]] with the support of the [[United Nations]], the [[Cominform]] criticized the JCP's gradualist policies, and directed the party to actively disrupt the American occupation.&lt;ref name="Taylorii"&gt;Taylor p. ii&lt;/ref&gt; 

Throughout the 1950s, Nosaka's efforts were challenged by American occupying forces, as part of a broader effort to suppress leftists.&lt;ref name="Universalium" /&gt; In 1949, a Communist-led general railroad strike led to several attempted derailments, and [[Shimoyama incident|Sadanori Shimoyama]], the president of [[Japanese National Railways]], was found lying across a set of train tracks in Tokyo with his arms and legs cut off.&lt;ref name="Whitney105" /&gt; These and other incidents of "terrorism" were received poorly by the Japanese public, and cost the JCP most of its popular support.&lt;ref name="Taylorii" /&gt;  The American commander of occupied Japan, [[Douglas MacArthur]], declined to outlaw the JCP, but held the Party's leaders responsible, and, in June 1950, ejected Nosaka and the other Communist legislators who were elected in 1946.&lt;ref name="Whitney105"&gt;Whitney pp. 105-106&lt;/ref&gt; After losing his seat in the Diet, Nosaka disappeared from public life and was forced to work underground.&lt;ref name="Universalium" /&gt;

After Nosaka went underground, the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] reported that he had temporarily returned to China.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; His strategy of "peaceful revolution" was criticized by the Cominform, and the Party temporarily endorsed violent revolution until 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; After working covertly for several years, Nosaka re-emerged in 1955 as the First Secretary of the JCP. Nosaka was briefly arrested after he resurfaced, but quickly released.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, Nosaka became the chairman of the JCP's Central Committee. He played a part in organizing a series of riots that lasted from May–June 1960 in opposition to the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan|US-Japan Security Treaty]].&lt;ref name="Kirkup" /&gt; These demonstrations forced the American president, [[Dwight Eisenhower]], to cancel a visit to Japan, and forced the Japanese Premier, [[Nobusuke Kishi]], to resign, but failed to achieve their main goal of seriously disrupting US-Japan relations. In Japanese public opinion, the demonstrations were received as a national embarrassment, and the JCP received only 3% of the popular vote in the 1960 elections.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor p. iv&lt;/ref&gt; The US-Japan Security Treaty was opposed by both ultra-rightists as well as ultra-leftists. In an attempt to stop the bill from being passed, an ultra-rightist university student named [[Otoya Yamaguchi]], rushed the stage and fatally stabbed the leader of the [[Social Democratic Party (Japan)|Japanese Socialist Party]], [[Inejiro Asanuma]] twice in the stomach with a [[wakizashi]], as the latter was giving a speech in support of the bill. After his arrest, Yamaguchi told police that he had hoped to assassinate Nosaka as well.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas&lt;/ref&gt; In Nov 1963, Nosaka survived an assassination attempt while making a speech in Osaka. The perpetrator was 22-year-old Masahiro Nakao, a member of the rightist group Dai Nippon Gokuku Dan. Nakao, armed with a dagger, leaped on a platform where Nosaka was giving his speech. Nakao was subdued by Party members who turned him over to the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19631114&amp;id=pNxXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JOkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5769,4475414&amp;hl=en|title= PLOT TO KILL RED BALKED|publisher= The Spokesman-Review |date= Nov 14, 1963|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nosaka attempted to keep the JCP neutral during the [[Sino-Soviet Split]] of the 1960s, though the CIA interpreted that Nosaka's party remained somewhat more friendly with the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor pp. 54-61&lt;/ref&gt; On Nosaka's seventieth birthday party in 1962, Nosaka received extravagant praise from Beijing. [[Deng Xiaoping]] praised Nosaka as an "outstanding fighter of the Japanese people and comrade-in-arms of the Chinese people". The Soviets sent Nosaka a matter-of-fact confirmation of his status within the JCP, and within a month sent the JCP another letter scolding the Party for not adequately supporting Soviet positions.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor p. 75, 79&lt;/ref&gt;  The Soviets' measured praise of Nosaka was consistent with earlier [[Cominform]] criticism of Nosaka's political theories, which advocated a peaceful transition into communism.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;

After his re-entry into public life in 1955, Nosaka was elected to the [[House of Councillors]], a post that he held until 1977.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; Nosaka joined the faculty of [[Keio University]], and was one of many prominent communist intellectuals active in Japanese academic institutions in his time. Nosaka remained the JCP's chairman from 1958–1982, when he stepped down at the age of 90 and took the role of "Honorary Chairman".&lt;ref name="Kirkup" /&gt;

===Scandal===
On September 27, 1992, two Journalists working for the magazine ''[[Shukan Bunshun]]'', Akira Kato and Shun'ichi Kobayashi, publicly revealed evidence of Nosaka's involvement in the deaths of Kenzo Yamamoto and his wife. On a trip to Moscow, Kobayashi and Kato had managed to purchase a number of KGB documents, which had been kept secret since the [[Stalinism|Stalinist era]]. Among these documents was the letter that Nosaka had written in 1939 denouncing Yamamoto and his wife.&lt;ref name="Kirkup" /&gt;

The revelations of Nosaka's involvement in Yamamoto's death shocked the JCP, already reduced to six seats in the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] after the 1991 elections. [[Shimbun Akahata|''Akahata'']] ("Red Flag"), a prominent communist newspaper, sent a team of journalists to Moscow to investigate the allegations, and they confirmed the authenticity of the documents.&lt;ref name="Kirkup" /&gt;

After the allegations against Nosaka became widely known, he checked himself into [[Yoyogi Hospital]] in Tokyo (a common tactic of Japanese politicians facing scandal). When a team of investigators sent by the JCP visited him,&lt;ref name="Kirkup" /&gt; Nosaka confessed that the letter was his, but refused to discuss the matter further.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt;  The JCP ordered Nosaka to be present for a general Party meeting on December 27, 1992. After some deliberation, the party that Nosaka helped found expelled him by unanimous vote.&lt;ref name="Kirkup" /&gt; The Party newspaper&lt;ref name="Pace" /&gt; reported that Nosaka, when asked if he had any reply to the charges against him, would only state: "I have nothing to say".&lt;ref name="Kirkup" /&gt;

One year after being expelled from the Japanese Communist Party, Sanzō Nosaka died in his home of old age. Outside the JCP, Nosaka was remembered for his gentle demeanor, good manners, and conservative sense of style, "just like a British gentleman".&lt;ref name="Kirkup" /&gt; He was 101 years old.&lt;ref&gt;''The Baltimore Sun''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shir LaShalom''' ({{lang-he|שיר לשלום}} ''A Song for Peace'') is a popular [[Israel]]i song that has become an anthem for the Israeli peace movement.

==History==
Shir LaShalom was written by [[Yaakov Rotblit]] and set to music by [[Yair Rosenblum]].&lt;ref&gt;On the collaboration between Rotblit and Rosenblum on ''Shir LaShalom'', see {{harvtxt|Regev|Seroussi|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kAxLAn6sOb4C&amp;pg=PA106 106]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first performed in 1969 by the Infantry Ensemble (להקת הנחל) of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) as part of its Sinai Infantry Outpost program, during the [[War of Attrition]] between Israel and Egypt. It featured the soloist [[Miri Aloni]], who later became a celebrated folk singer and actor. Many of the other members of the ensemble who took part in the recording of the song went on to become well-known figures in the Israeli entertainment scene. Among them was [[Danny Sanderson]], whose electric guitar solo opened the recording.

Rosenblum originally intended the song for the Israeli Navy Ensemble. He sent it to them from his home in London, with the stipulation that he arrange it himself. When the musical director of the Navy Ensemble, Benny Nagari, rejected that condition, Rosenblum passed the song on to the [[Nahal]] Infantry Ensemble, with which he had worked some time previously.

==Form and Content==
Both in its lyrics and its music, Shir LaShalom was influenced by the Anglo-American anti-war folk-rock songs of the 1960s.{{sfnp|Edelman|2003|pp=235-6}}

The song expresses a yearning for peace. It mourns comrades who have fallen in battle, and claims to speak for the fallen. The lyrics take issue with the 'culture of bereavement', and with the glorification of war that allegedly exists in Israel. It calls on those who live on to strive for peace. In the line 'The purest of prayers will not bring us back' (הזכה שבתפילות אותנו לא תחזיר ''hazakah shebatfilot otanu lo takhzir''), the lyrics seem to question the value of reciting the [[Kaddish]] prayer at the graveside. In a similar vein, they seem to confront an ethos that memorializes fallen soldiers: 'Let the sun penetrate through the flowers [on the graves]' (תנו לשמש לחדור מבעד לפרחים ''tnu lashemesh lakhador miba'ad la prakhim''). In the lines 'Lift your eyes in hope, not through (gun) sights' (שאו עיניים בתקווה, לא דרך כוונות ''s'u 'enayim betikvah, lo derekh kavanot''), the song uses martial concepts in order to subvert those same concepts. The lyrics are critical of songs that appear to glorify the culture of war; for example, [[Natan Alterman]]'s War of Independence era ''Magash HaKesef'' ('Silver Platter'),&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew text of Alterman's poem, with an English translation, can be found at {{cite web |url= http://magashhakesef.blogspot.com.au/2009/09/i-am-silver-platter.html|title= I am a Silver Platter|last1= Silver|first1= Zachary|last2= |first2= |date= September 8, 2009|website= Magash HaKesef|publisher= |accessdate=June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the songs ''Giv'at haTaḥmoshet'' ('Ammunition Hill', for which Yair Rosenblum also wrote the music) and ''Balada laḤovesh'' ('Ballad for a Corpsman') from 1968.{{sfnp|Regev|Seroussi|2004|pp=98, 117}} Instead, the lyrics ask us to sing of love: 'Sing a song to love, and not to wars' (שירו שיר לאהבה, ולא למלחמות ''shiru shir la'ahavah velo lamilkhamot'').

That line originally read שירו שיר לאהבה, ולא לניצחונות 'Sing a song to love and not to victories'. The original wording extolled peace and love over any tally of victories and conquests. Since the song was intended for a military ensemble, the head of the IDF education department at that time demanded that the line be removed. He argued that the performance of such a song by soldiers before an audience of other soldiers would be damaging to morale. In the end the IDF agreed to the replacement of the last word of the line, ניצחונות ''nitsakhonot'' 'victories' by מלחמות ''milkhamot'' 'wars', and the song was recorded and published in that revised form.{{sfnp|Tessler|2007|p=98}}&lt;ref&gt;For an English translation based on the song's original wording, see {{cite web |url= http://www.myjewishlearning.com/blog/rabbis-without-borders/tag/shir-lashalom/|title= Yitzhak Rabin: Captain, O My Captain!|last= Small|first= Rabbi Amy|date= October 20, 2013|website=Rabbis Without Borders - My Jewish Learning|publisher= |accessdate=June 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Don't say the day will come,
Bring the day about!
For it is not a dream.
And in all the city squares,
Cheer for peace!
&lt;/poem&gt;
|}

Both in its tempo and its lyrics the song is evocative of an anthem. Frequent use is made of Hebrew imperative plural forms, like הביאו ''havi'u'' 'bring!' and הריעו ''hari'u'' 'cheer!' in the last verse. These forms exhort those who hear them to be proactive in the quest for peace. That message, apparently influenced by the hippie counter-culture of the era in which it was written, struck a chord with a large segment of the Israeli population.

From the outset ''Shir LaShalom'' was divisive. Many identified with its message of peace, and some saw in it echoes of the ''Mt. Scopus Speech'' given by Yitzhak Rabin on accepting an Honorary Doctorate from Hebrew University (June 28, 1967). In that speech Rabin, who had been Chief of Staff during the Six Day War, had stressed the personal sacrifice both of those Israeli soldiers who fell in the war, in the great Israeli victory, as well as the price paid by the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;A translation of Rabin's 'Mount Scopus Speech', {{cite web |url= http://www.rabincenter.org.il/Items/01098/RabinAddressforHonoraryPhD.pdf|title= The Man - Not The Metal|website=The Yitzhak Rabin Center|accessdate=June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A commentary on Rabin's 'Mount Scopus Speech', with translation, by the late Israeli peace activist Ami Isseroff, at {{cite web |url= http://zionism-israel.com/hdoc/Rabin_Doctorate_Acceptance.htm|title= Yitzhak Rabin: Acceptance of Honorary Doctorate |accessdate= June 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this was also the period–in the wake of victory in the Six Day War and before the trauma of the Yom Kippur War–when 'Israeli assertiveness' by a portion of the Israeli public was at its peak. Many saw the song as defeatist, and regarded as blasphemous the song's criticism of the supposed 'culture of bereavement'. When the head of the IDF's Central Command in 1969, [[Rehavam Ze'evi]], heard the song performed, he banned the ensemble from appearing in the zone under his command, as did the general in charge of the IDF's southern command, [[Ariel Sharon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/449930/ISRAELIS-SONG-OF-PEACE-HAS-DISHARMONIOUS-HISTORY.html?pg=all|title= Song of Peace Has Disharmonious History|accessdate= June 24, 2014|last=Kampeas|first=Ron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the song became a kind of unofficial political anthem for the Israeli peace movement, particularly for [[Peace Now]] (שלום עכשיו ''Shalom Achshav''). It is sung at their meetings and public demonstrations, occasionally in an Arabic version as well.  The left-wing [[Meretz]] party purchased exclusive rights to use Shir LaShalom in its 1996 election campaign from the composer and lyricist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first =Yudelman| last = Michal| title = Meretz gets 'The Peace Song' rights for campaign | url =  | newspaper = ''The Jerusalem Post''| date = April 9, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and changed the first line of the song from 'Let the sun rise' (תנו לשמש לעלות ''tnu lashemesh la'alot'') into the party slogan 'Let Meretz rise' (תנו למרץ לעלות ''tnu leMerets la'alot'').

At the close of a peace rally on November 4, 1995, those on the podium–Miri Aloni, the groups Gevatron and Irusim, and the statesmen Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin–led the crowd in singing Shir LaShalom. Just after the rally ended, Yitzhak Rabin was [[assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|assassinated]]. In his shirt pocket was found a page with the song's lyrics, stained with his blood.

Shir haShalom featured on the Rabin memorial album ''O Captain'' ({{lang-he-n|רַב־חוֹבֵל}} ''Rav Ḥovel'') released in 2000, and is regularly sung at ceremonies commemorating Rabin's death.{{sfnp|Vinitzky-Seroussi|2010|pp=61-2 et passim}} In a cross-media poll held in Israel's 50th anniversary year of 1998 to select Israel's Song of the Jubilee, ''Shir LaShalom'' placed third.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabranet.com/theisraelhour/vote.html Song of the Jubilee Top Ten], from ''The Israel Hour'' at Rutgers Radio.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Eliram|2006|p=175|ps=, ''Table 8: The Highest Ranking Songs of the 'Song of the Jubilee' Hit Parade 1998'' ({{lang-he|שירים שצעדו בראש מצעד 'בוחרים את שיר היובל' 1998}}).}}

It was established on 1 June 1992 by the Act of the [[Slovak National Council]] no. 138/1992 Coll (č. 138/1992 Zb.), about authorized architects and authorized building engineers. It is financed from own revenues without state subsidies. It is a member of the [[Architectural Council of Europe]] (ACE) and part of the network of competent authorities in architecture – the  [[European Network of Architects Competent Authorities]] (ENACA). The organization brings together the [[architect]]s and [[landscape architect]]s in [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.komarch.sk/|title=Slovenská komora architektov|website=www.komarch.sk|language=sk-SK|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Holocaust''', also referred to as '''the Shoah''',{{efn|[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: &lt;big&gt;{{lang|he|השואה}}&lt;/big&gt;, ''HaShoah'', "the catastrophe"}} was a [[genocide]] during [[World War II]] in which [[Nazi Germany]], aided by [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers|its collaborators]], systematically murdered some six million [[European Jew]]s,{{efn|name=definition}} around two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe,{{efn|[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]: "Six million Jews died in the Holocaust.&amp;nbsp;... According to the ''American Jewish Yearbook'', the Jewish population of Europe was about 9.5 million in 1933.&amp;nbsp;...

Retrieved 9 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;}} between 1941 and 1945.{{sfn|Landau|2016|p=3}} Jews were targeted for extermination as part of a larger event involving the persecution and murder of other groups, including in particular the [[Porajmos|Roma]] and [[Aktion T4|"incurably sick"]],&lt;ref&gt;For one example of historians who include the Roma and disabled in their definition of "the Holocaust", see {{harvnb|Niewyk|Nicosia|2000|p=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation|ethnic Poles]] and other [[Slavs]], Soviet citizens, [[German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|Soviet prisoners of war]], [[German resistance to Nazism|political opponents]], [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|gay men]] and [[Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany|Jehovah's Witnesses]], resulting in up to 17 million deaths overall.{{efn|name=Columbianumbers|Donald Niewyk and Francis Nicosia (''The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust'', 2000): "The Holocaust is commonly defined as the mass murder of more than 5,000,000 Jews by the Germans during World War II. Not everyone finds this a fully satisfactory definition. The Nazis also killed millions of people belonging to other groups: Gypsies, the physically and mentally handicapped, Soviet prisoners of war, Polish and Soviet citizens, political prisoners, religious dissenters, and homosexuals. Can it be said that any of these groups were treated in the same way as the Jews and for the same reasons and hence deserve to be included in the history of the Holocaust? A positive answer to this question would require a broader definition of the Holocaust and acknowledging as many as 17,000,000 victims. A more expansive view might also induce us to push the start of the Holocaust back from 1941 to 1939 (if we include the handicapped) or even to 1933 (if we assume that the whole thing was premeditated)."{{sfn|Niewyk|Nicosia|2000|p=43}}}}

Germany implemented the persecution in stages. Following [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|rise to power]] in 1933, the government passed laws to exclude Jews from civil society, most prominently the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935. Starting in 1933, the Nazis built a network of [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] in Germany for political opponents and people deemed "undesirable". After the [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, the regime set up [[Nazi ghettos|ghettos]] to segregate Jews. Over 42,000 camps, ghettos, and other detention sites were established.&lt;ref name=42000facilities&gt;[https://www.ushmm.org/research/publications/encyclopedia-camps-ghettos "Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933–1945"], United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

The deportation of Jews to the [[ghetto]]s culminated in the policy of extermination the Nazis called the "[[Final Solution|Final Solution to the Jewish Question]]", discussed by senior Nazi officials at the [[Wannsee Conference]] in Berlin in January 1942. As German forces [[Operation Barbarossa|captured territories in the East]], all anti-Jewish measures were radicalized. Under the coordination of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], with directions from the highest leadership of the [[Nazi Party]], killings were committed within Germany itself, throughout [[German-occupied Europe]], and across all territories controlled by the [[Axis powers]]. Paramilitary [[death squads]] called ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' in cooperation with [[Security Division (Wehrmacht)|Wehrmacht police battalions]] and [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers|local collaborators]] murdered around 1.3 million Jews in mass shootings between 1941 and 1945. By mid-1942, victims were being [[Operation Reinhard|deported from the ghettos]] in sealed [[Holocaust trains|freight trains]] to [[extermination camp]]s where, if they survived the journey, they were killed in [[Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|gas chambers]]. The killing continued until the [[end of World War II in Europe]] in May 1945.

==Terminology and scope==
&lt;!--rename this section Holocaust historiography and briefly discuss functionalism v intentionalism to frame what follows--&gt;

===Terminology===
{{Main|Names of the Holocaust}}
The term ''holocaust'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|ὁλόκαυστος}} ''{{lang|el-Latn|holókaustos}}'': ''hólos'', "whole" and ''kaustós'', "burnt offering".{{sfn|Dawidowicz|1986|p=xxxvii}}{{efn|''Oxford Dictionaries'' (2017): "from Old French holocauste, via late Latin from Greek holokauston, from holos 'whole' + kaustos 'burnt' (from kaiein 'burn')".&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite web | title=Holocaust |work=Oxford Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/holocaust |accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The ''[[Century Dictionary]]'' defined it in 1904 as "a sacrifice or offering entirely consumed by fire, in use among the Jews and some pagan nations".{{efn|The definition continued: "Figuratively, a great slaughter or sacrifice of life, as by fire or other accident, or in battle".&lt;ref name=Whitney&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Whitney |editor-first=William Dwight |editor-link=William Dwight Whitney |year=1904 |title=Holocaust |encyclopedia=[[Century Dictionary|The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia]] |volume=4 |p=2859 |url=https://archive.org/stream/centurydictio04whit#page/2858/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The biblical term ''[[Names of the Holocaust#Shoah|shoah]]'' (שואה), meaning "destruction", became the standard [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term for the murder of the European Jews, first used in a pamphlet in 1940, ''Sho'at Yehudei Polin'' ("Sho'ah of Polish Jews"), published by the United Aid Committee for the Jews  in Poland.&lt;ref name=HolocaustYadVashem&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%206419.pdf |title=Holocaust |publisher=Holocaust Resource Center, [[Yad Vashem]] |accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YVDefinition&gt;{{cite web |title=The Holocaust: Definition and Preliminary Discussion |url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/resource_center/the_holocaust.asp |publisher=Holocaust Resource Center, [[Yad Vashem]] |accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--On 14 May 1948, during the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]], [[David Ben-Gurion]] referred to "The Nazi Holocaust, which engulfed millions of Jews in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005459 "Postwar Refugee Crisis and the Establishment of the State of Israel"], United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; In October 1941 the magazine ''[[The American Hebrew]]'' used the phrase "before the Holocaust", apparently to refer to the situation in Europe,{{sfn|Fischel|2010|p=115}} and in May 1943 ''The New York Times'', discussing the [[Bermuda Conference]], referred to the "hundreds of thousands of European Jews still surviving the Nazi Holocaust".&lt;ref&gt;Meltzer, Julian (23 May 1943). [https://www.nytimes.com/1943/05/23/archives/palestine-zionists-find-outlook-dark-they-see-little-hope-now-for.html "Palestine Zionists Find Outlook Dark"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Library of Congress]] created a new category, "Holocaust, Jewish (1939–1945)" in 1968;{{sfn|Lustigman|Lustigman|1994|p=111}} the term was popularized in the United States by the [[NBC]] mini-series [[Holocaust (TV miniseries)|''Holocaust'']] (1978), about a fictional family of [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jews]].{{sfn|Black|2016|p=201}} As non-Jewish groups began to count themselves as victims of the Holocaust too, many Jews chose to use the terms ''Shoah'' or ''[[Churban Europa|Churban]]'' instead.{{sfn|Fischel|2010|p=115}}{{efn|The Hebrew word ''churban'' is used by many [[Orthodox Jews]] to refer to the Holocaust.{{sfn|Fischel|1998|p=46}}}} The Nazis used the phrase "[[Final Solution to the Jewish Question]]" (''die Endlösung der Judenfrage'').{{sfn|Berenbaum|2006|p=xix}}

===Definition===
Most Holocaust historians define the Holocaust as the German state policy, enacted between 1941 and 1945, to exterminate the European Jews.{{efn|name=definition|[[Jack Fischel|Jack R. Fischel]] (''Historical Dictionary of the Holocaust'', 2010): "The Holocaust refers to the Nazi objective of annihilating every Jewish man, woman, and child who fell under their control."{{sfn|Fischel|2010|p=115}}{{pb}}
[[Martin Gilbert]] (''The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy'', 1985): "the systematic attempt to destroy all European Jewry—an attempt now known as the Holocaust".{{sfn|Gilbert|1985|p=18}}{{pb}}
[[Peter Hayes (historian)|Peter Hayes]] (''How Was It Possible? A Holocaust Reader'', 2015): "The Holocaust, the Nazi attempt to eradicate the Jews of Europe, has come to be regarded as the emblematic event of Twentieth Century&amp;nbsp;... Hitler's ideology depicted the Jews as uniquely dangerous to Germany and therefore uniquely destined to disappear completely from the Reich and all territories subordinate to it. The threat posted by supposedly corrupting but generally powerless Sinti and Roma was far less, and therefore addressed inconsistently in the Nazi realm. Gay men were defined as a problem only if they were German or having sex with Germans or having sex with Germans and considered 'curable' in most cases.&amp;nbsp;... Germany's murderous intent toward the handicapped inhabitants of European mental institutions&amp;nbsp;... was more comprehensive&amp;nbsp;... but here, too, implementation was uneven and life-saving exceptions permitted, especially in Western Europe. Not only were some Slavs—Slovaks, Croats, Bulgarians, some Ukrainians—allotted a favored place in Hitler's New Order, but the fate of most of the other Slavs the Nazis derided as sub-humans&amp;nbsp;... consisted of enslavement and gradual attrition, not the prompt massacre meted out to the Jews after 1941."{{sfn|Hayes|2015|p=xiii–xiv}}{{pb}}
[[Raul Hilberg]] (''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'', 2003): "With the passage of time, the response of the entire Jewish community to its massive loss became a pervasive problem. At the beginning there was little memorialization. No special observances were held, no major monuments were erected, and not many efforts were made to record the meaning of Auschwitz and Treblinka. Little by little, some documents were gathered and books were written, and after about two decades the annihilation of the Jews was given a name: Holocaust."{{sfn|Hilberg|2003|p=1133}}
Ronnie S. Landau (''The Nazi Holocaust: Its History and Meaning'', 1992): "The Holocaust involved the deliberate, systematic murder of approximately 6 million Jews in Nazi-dominated Europe between 1941 and 1945."{{sfn|Landau|2016|p=3}}{{pb}}
[[Michael Marrus]] (''Perspectives on the Holocaust'', 2015): "The Holocaust, the murder of close to six million Jews by the Nazis during the Second World War&amp;nbsp;...".{{sfn|Marrus|2015|p=vii}}{{pb}}
[[Timothy D. Snyder]] (''Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin'', 2010): "In this book the term ''Holocaust'' signifies the final version of the Final Solution, the German policy to eliminate the Jews of Europe by murdering them. Although Hitler certainly wished to remove the Jews from Europe in a Final Solution earlier, the Holocaust on this definition begins in summer 1941, with the shooting of Jewish women and children in the occupied Soviet Union. The term ''Holocaust'' is sometimes used in two other ways: to mean all German killing policies during the war, or to mean all oppression of Jews by the Nazi regime. In this book, ''Holocaust'' means the murder of the Jews in Europe, as carried out by the Germans by guns and gas between 1941 and 1945."{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=412}}{{pb}}
[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] (2017): "The Holocaust was the systematic, bureaucratic, state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million Jews by the Nazi regime and its collaborators."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005143 |title=Introduction to the Holocaust |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher= United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate= 4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In ''Teaching the Holocaust'' (2015), Michael Gray offers three definitions:

*the persecution and murder of Jews by the Nazis and their collaborators between 1933 and 1945; this definition views the events of ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in Germany in 1938 as an early phase of the Holocaust;{{sfn|Gray|2015|p=8}}
*the systematic mass murder of Jews by the Nazis and their collaborators between 1941 and 1945; this acknowledges the shift in German policy in 1941 toward the extermination of the Jewish people;{{sfn|Gray|2015|p=8}}
*the persecution and murder of several groups by the Nazis and their collaborators between 1933 and 1945; this includes all the Nazis' victims.{{sfn|Gray|2015|p=8}}

The third definition fails, Gray writes, to acknowledge that only the Jewish people were singled out for annihilation.{{sfn|Gray|2015|p=8}} Donald Niewyk and Francis Nicosia, in ''The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust'' (2000), favour a definition that focuses on the Jews, [[Romani genocide|Roma]], and [[Aktion T4]] victims: "The Holocaust—that is, Nazi genocide—was the systematic, state-sponsored murder of entire groups determined by heredity. This applied to Jews, Gypsies, and the handicapped."{{sfn|Niewyk|Nicosia|2000|p=52}}

The logistics of the mass murder turned the country into what [[Michael Berenbaum]] called "a genocidal state". Bureaucrats identified who was a Jew, confiscated property, and scheduled trains that deported Jews. Companies fired Jews and later employed them as slave labour. Universities dismissed Jewish faculty and students. German pharmaceutical companies tested drugs on camp prisoners; other companies built the [[crematoria]].{{sfn|Berenbaum|2006|p=103}} As prisoners entered the death camps, they were ordered to surrender all personal property, which was catalogued and tagged before being sent to Germany for reuse or recycling.{{sfn|Arad|1987|pp=154–159}} Through a [[Max Heiliger|concealed account]], the German National Bank helped [[money laundering|launder valuables]] stolen from the victims.{{sfn|Fischel|1998|p=167}}

The industrialization and scale of the murder was unprecedented. The killings were systematically conducted in virtually all areas of [[occupied Europe]]—more than 20 occupied countries.{{sfn|United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|1996|p=7}} Close to three million Jews in [[German-occupied Poland|occupied Poland]] and between 700,000 and 2.5 million Jews in the [[Soviet Union]] were killed. Hundreds of thousands more died in the rest of Europe.{{sfn|Crowe|2008|p=447}} Victims were transported in sealed [[Holocaust train|freight trains]] from all over Europe to [[extermination camp]]s equipped with [[gas chamber]]s.{{sfn|Evans|2015|p=385}} The stationary facilities grew out of Nazi experiments with poison gas during the [[Aktion T4]] mass murder ("euthanasia") programme against the disabled and mentally ill, which began in 1939.&lt;ref name="Gassing"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005220 | title=Gassing Operations | publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] | accessdate=25 January 2015| work=Holocaust Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans set up six extermination camps in Poland: [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]] (established October 1941); [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]] (October 1941); [[Chełmno extermination camp|Chełmno]] (December 1941); and in 1942 the three [[Operation Reinhard]] camps at [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]], and [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]].&lt;ref name=deathcamps&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005145 | title=Killing Centers: An Overview | publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] | accessdate=30 September 2017 | work=Holocaust Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gellately|Stoltzfus|2001|p=216}}&lt;!--rewrite: [[Maly Trostenets extermination camp|Maly Trostenets]], a concentration camp, was established in the [[Reichskommissariat Ostland]].--&gt;

[[Eberhard Jäckel]] writes that it was the first time a state had thrown its power behind the idea that an entire people should be wiped out.{{efn|[[Eberhard Jäckel]] (1986): "The National Socialist killing of the Jews was unique in that never before had a state with the authority of its responsible leader decided and announced that a specific human group, including its aged, its women, its children and infants, would be killed as quickly as possible, and then carried through this resolution using every possible means of state power."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maier|1997|p=53}}, citing Jäckel, Eberhard (12 September 1986).

Some Christian churches declared, according to Friedländer, "that converted Jews should be regarded as part of the flock, but even then only up to a point".{{sfn|Friedländer|2007|p=xxi}} Discussions at the [[Wannsee Conference]] in January 1942 make it clear that the German "final solution of the Jewish question" was intended eventually to include Britain and all the neutral states in Europe, including Ireland, Switzerland, Turkey, Sweden, Portugal, and Spain.{{sfn|Gilbert|2001|p=289}}

===Medical experiments===
{{main| Nazi human experimentation|Doctors' trial}}
[[File:Doctors' trial, Nuremberg, 1946–1947.jpg|thumb|left|The 23 defendants during the [[Doctors' trial]], Nuremberg, 9 December 1946&amp;nbsp;– 20 August 1947]]

Medical experiments conducted on camp inmates by the SS were another distinctive feature.{{sfn|Niewyk|Nicosia|2000|pp=229–230}} At least 7,000 prisoners were subjected to experiments; most died as a result, during the experiments or later.{{sfn|Fisher|2001|pp=410–414}} Twenty-three senior physicians and other medical personnel were charged at [[Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg]], after the war, with crimes against humanity. They included the head of the German Red Cross, tenured professors, clinic directors, and biomedical researchers.{{sfn|Hanauske-Abel|1996|p=1453}} Experiments took place at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]], [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Natzweiler concentration camp|Natzweiler]], [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]], [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]], [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]], and elsewhere. Some dealt with sterilization of men and women, the treatment of war wounds, ways to counteract chemical weapons, research into new vaccines and drugs, and the survival of harsh conditions.{{sfn|Fisher|2001|pp=410–414}}

The most notorious physician was [[Josef Mengele]], an SS officer who became the Auschwitz camp doctor on 30 May 1943.{{sfn|Müller-Hill|1999|p=338}} Interested in genetics{{sfn|Müller-Hill|1999|p=338}} and keen to experiment on twins, he would pick out subjects from the new arrivals during "selection" on the ramp, shouting "''Zwillinge heraus!''" (twins step forward!).{{sfn|Friedländer |2007|p=505}} They would be measured, killed, and dissected. One of Mengele's assistants said in 1946 that he was told to send organs of interest to the directors of the "Anthropological Institute in Berlin-Dahlem". This is thought to refer to Mengele's academic supervisor, [[Otmar von Verschuer]], director from October 1942 of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics]] in [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Berlin-Dahlem]].{{sfn|Müller-Hill|1999|pp=340–342}}{{sfn|Friedländer |2007|p=505}}{{efn|The full extent of Mengele's work is unknown because records he sent to [[Otmar von Verschuer]] are assumed to have been destroyed.{{sfn|Müller-Hill|1999|p=348}}{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=358}}}} Mengele's experiments included placing subjects in pressure chambers, testing drugs on them, freezing them, attempting to change their eye color by injecting chemicals into children's eyes, and amputations and other surgeries.{{sfn|Harran|2000|p=384}}

==Origins==
===Antisemitism and the völkisch movement===
{{see also|History of the Jews in Germany|Christianity and antisemitism|Martin Luther and antisemitism|Religious antisemitism|Racial antisemitism}}
Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, Jews were subjected to [[antisemitism]] based on Christian theology, which blamed them for killing Jesus. Even after the [[Reformation]], [[Catholicism]] and [[Lutheranism]] continued to persecute Jews, accusing them of [[blood libel]]s and subjecting them to [[pogrom]]s and expulsions.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=148}}{{sfn|Bergen|2016|pp=14–17}} The second half of the 19th century saw the emergence in the [[German empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] of the [[völkisch movement|''völkisch'' movement]], which was developed by such thinkers as [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] and [[Paul de Lagarde]]. The movement embraced a [[Scientific racism|pseudo-scientific racism]] that viewed Jews as a [[Race (human categorization)|race]] whose members were locked in mortal combat with the [[Aryan race]] for world domination.{{sfn|Fischer|2002|pp=47–49}} These ideas became commonplace throughout Germany,{{sfn|Evans|1989|pp=69–70}} with the professional classes adopting an ideology that did not see humans as racial equals with equal hereditary value.{{sfn|Friedlander|1994|pp=495–496}} Although the ''völkisch'' parties had support in elections at first, by 1914 they were no longer influential. This did not mean that antisemitism had disappeared; instead it was incorporated into the platforms of several mainstream political parties.{{sfn|Evans|1989|pp=69–70}}

===Germany after World War I, Hitler's world view===
{{further|Treaty of Versailles|Political views of Adolf Hitler#Anti-Semitism and the Holocaust}}
The political situation in Germany and elsewhere in Europe after [[World War I]] (1914–1918) contributed to the rise of virulent antisemitism. Many Germans did not accept that their country had been defeated, which gave birth to the [[stab-in-the-back myth]]. This insinuated that it was disloyal politicians, chiefly Jews and communists, who had orchestrated Germany's surrender. Inflaming the anti-Jewish sentiment was the apparent over-representation of Jews in the leadership of communist revolutionary governments in Europe, such as [[Ernst Toller]], head of a short-lived revolutionary government in Bavaria. This perception contributed to the canard of [[Jewish Bolshevism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Antisemitism in History: World War I |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007166 |accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic strains of the [[Great Depression]] led some in the German medical establishment to advocate murder (euphemistically called "euthanasia") of the "incurable" mentally and physically disabled as a cost-saving measure to free up funds for the curable.{{sfn|Evans|2004|pp=377–378}} By the time the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]], or Nazi Party,{{efn|The party was originally formed after World War I as the ''Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'' or DAP ([[German Workers' Party]]) and changed its name in April 1920 to the ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'' or NDAP (National Socialist German Workers' Party, or Nazi Party).{{sfn|Snyder|1976|p=63}} }} came to power in 1933, there was already a tendency to seek to save the racially "valuable", while ridding society of the racially "undesirable".{{sfn|Peukert|1994|p=289}} The party had originated in 1920{{sfn|Snyder|1976|p=63}} as an offshoot of the ''völkisch'' movement, and it adopted that movement's antisemitism.{{sfn|Fischer|2002|p=47}} Early antisemites in the party included [[Dietrich Eckart]], publisher of the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'', the party's newspaper, and [[Alfred Rosenberg]], who wrote antisemitic articles for it in the 1920s. Rosenberg's vision of a secretive Jewish conspiracy ruling the world would influence Hitler's views of Jews by making them the driving force behind communism.{{sfn|Yahil|1990|pp=41–43}} The origin and first expression of Hitler's antisemitism remain a matter of debate.{{sfn|Kershaw|1998|p=60}} Central to his world view was the idea of expansion and ''[[lebensraum]]'' (living space) for Germany. Open about his hatred of Jews, he subscribed to the common antisemitic stereotypes.{{sfn|Bergen|2016|pp=52–54}} From the early 1920s onwards, he compared the Jews to germs and said they should be dealt with in the same way. He viewed [[Marxism]] as a Jewish doctrine, said he was fighting against "[[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Marxism]]", and believed that Jews had created communism as part of a conspiracy to destroy Germany.{{sfn|Bergen|2016|p=56}}

With the establishment of the Third Reich in 1933, German leaders proclaimed the rebirth of the ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' ("people's community").{{sfn|Fritzsche|2009|pp=38–39}} Nazi policies divided the population into two groups: the ''Volksgenossen'' ("national comrades") who belonged to the ''Volksgemeinschaft'', and the ''Gemeinschaftsfremde'' ("community aliens") who did not. Enemies were divided into three groups: the "racial" or "blood" enemies, such as the Jews and Roma; political opponents of Nazism, such as Marxists, liberals, Christians, and the "reactionaries" viewed as wayward "national comrades"; and moral opponents, such as gay men, the "work-shy", and habitual criminals. The latter two groups were to be sent to concentration camps for "re-education", with the aim of eventual absorption into the ''Volksgemeinschaft''. "Racial" enemies could never belong to the ''Volksgemeinschaft''; they were to be removed from society.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1983|p=499}}

Before and after the [[German federal election, March 1933|March 1933 ''Reichstag'' elections]], the Nazis intensified their campaign of violence against opponents.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=28–30}} They set up concentration camps for extrajudicial imprisonment.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=32–38}} One of the first, at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], opened on 9 March 1933.{{sfn|Gilbert|1985|p=32}} Initially the camp contained mostly Communists and Social Democrats.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=155}} Other early prisons were consolidated by mid-1934 into purpose-built camps outside the cities, run exclusively by the SS.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=84–86}} The initial purpose of the camps was to serve as a deterrent by terrorizing Germans who did not conform.{{sfn|Peukert|1987|p=214}}

Throughout the 1930s, the legal, economic, and social rights of Jews were steadily restricted.{{sfn|Friedländer|1997|p=33}} On 1 April 1933, there was a [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|boycott of Jewish businesses]].{{sfn|Evans|2004|pp=434–435}} On 7 April 1933, the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] was passed, which excluded Jews and other "non-Aryans" from the civil service.{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|p=78}} Jews were [[disbarment|disbarred]] from practising law, being editors or proprietors of newspapers, or joining the Journalists' Association. Jews were not allowed to own farms.{{sfn|Friedländer|1997|pp=32–33}} In [[Silesia]], in March 1933, a group of men entered the courthouse and beat up Jewish lawyers; Friedländer writes that, in Dresden, Jewish lawyers and judges were dragged out of courtrooms during trials.{{sfn|Friedländer|1997|p=29}} Jewish students were restricted by quotas from attending schools and universities.{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|p=78}} Jewish businesses were targeted for closure or "Aryanization", the forcible sale to Germans; of the approximately 50,000 Jewish-owned businesses in Germany in 1933, about 7,000 were still Jewish-owned in April 1939. Works by Jewish composers,{{sfn|Friedländer|1997|p=134}} authors, and artists were excluded from publications, performances, and exhibitions.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=158–159, 169}} Jewish doctors were dismissed or urged to resign. The ''[[Deutsches Ärzteblatt]]'' (a medical journal) reported on 6 April 1933: "Germans are to be treated by Germans only."{{sfn|Hanauske-Abel|1996|p=1459}}

The Nazis used the phrase ''Lebensunwertes Leben'' ([[life unworthy of life]]) in reference to the disabled and mentally ill.{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=21}} On 14 July 1933, the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] (''Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses''), the Sterilization Law, was passed, allowing for compulsory sterilization.{{sfn|Hanauske-Abel|1996|p=1457}}{{sfn|Proctor|1988|pp=101–103}} The ''New York Times'' reported on 21 December that year: "400,000 Germans to be sterilized".&lt;ref&gt;Tolischus, Otto D.

The courts reached a decision in 64,499 of those cases; 56,244 were in favor of sterilization.{{sfn|Hanauske-Abel|1996|p=1458}} Estimates for the number of involuntary sterilizations during the whole of the Third Reich range from 300,000 to 400,000.{{sfn|Proctor|1988|pp=106–108}}

In October 1939 Hitler signed a "euthanasia decree" backdated to 1 September 1939 that authorized ''[[Reichsleiter]]'' [[Philipp Bouhler]], the chief of [[Hitler's Chancellery]], and [[Karl Brandt]], Hitler's personal physician, to carry out a program of involuntary "euthanasia"; after the war this program was named ''Aktion T4''.{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|pp=142–149}} It was named after [[Tiergartenstraße]]&amp;nbsp;4, the address of a villa in the Berlin borough of [[Tiergarten, Berlin|Tiergarten]], where the various organizations involved were headquartered.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000|pp=252–261}} T4 was mainly directed at adults, but the "euthanasia" of children was also carried out.{{sfn|Bloxham|2009|p=171}} Between 1939 and 1941, 80,000 to 100,000 mentally ill adults in institutions were killed, as were 5,000 children and 1,000 Jews, also in institutions. In addition there were specialized killing centres, where the deaths were estimated at 20,000, according to Georg Renno, the deputy director of [[Schloss Hartheim]], one of the "euthanasia" centers, or 400,000, according to Frank Zeireis, the commandant of the Mauthausen concentration camp.{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=142}} Overall, the number of mentally and physically handicapped murdered was about 150,000.{{sfn|Niewyk|Nicosia|2000|p=48}}

Although not ordered to take part, psychiatrists and many psychiatric institutions were involved in the planning and carrying out of ''Aktion T4'' at every stage.{{sfn|Strous|2007}} After protests from the German Catholic and Protestant churches, Hitler ordered the cancellation of the T4 program in August 1941,{{sfn|Lifton|2000|pp=90–95}} although the disabled and mentally ill continued to be killed until the end of the war.{{sfn|Niewyk|Nicosia|2000|p=48}} The medical community regularly received bodies and body parts for research. [[Eberhard Karl University]] received 1,077 bodies from executions between 1933 and 1945. The neuroscientist [[Julius Hallervorden]] received 697 brains from one hospital between 1940 and 1944: "I accepted these brains of course. Where they came from and how they came to me was really none of my business."{{sfn|Hanauske-Abel|1996|pp=1458–1459}}

On 15 September 1935, the Reichstag passed the Reich Citizenship Law and the Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor, known as the [[Nuremberg Laws]]. The former said that only those of "German or kindred blood" could be citizens. Anyone with three or more Jewish grandparents was classified as a Jew.&lt;ref name=USHMMNuremberg/&gt; The second law said: "Marriages between Jews and subjects of the state of German or related blood are forbidden." Sexual relationships between them were also criminalized; Jews were not allowed to employ German women under the age of 45 in their homes.{{sfn|Arad|Gutman|Margaliot|2014|p=78}} The laws referred to Jews but applied equally to the Roma and black Germans.&lt;ref name=USHMMNuremberg&gt;[https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007902 Nuremberg Laws], ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'', United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.

Nazi racial policy aimed at forcing Jews to emigrate.{{sfn|Gilbert|2001|p=285}} Fifty thousand German Jews had left Germany by the end of 1934,{{sfn|Fischel|1998|p=20}} and by the end of 1938, approximately half the German Jewish population had left the country.{{sfn|Gilbert|2001|p=285}} Among the prominent Jews who left was the conductor [[Bruno Walter]], who fled after being told that the hall of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] would be burned down if he conducted a concert there.{{sfn|Friedländer|1997|p=1}} [[Albert Einstein]], who was abroad when Hitler came to power, never returned to Germany. He was expelled from the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]] and the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]], and his citizenship was revoked.{{sfn|Friedländer|1997|p=12}} Other Jewish scientists, including [[Gustav Hertz]], lost their teaching positions and left the country.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=16}} In March 1938 [[Anschluss|Germany annexed Austria]]. Austrian Nazis broke into Jewish shops, stole from Jewish homes and businesses, and forced Jews to perform humiliating acts such as scrubbing the streets or cleaning toilets.{{sfn|Cesarani|2016|pp=147–150}} Jewish businesses were "Aryanized", and all the legal restrictions on Jews in Germany were imposed.{{sfn|Cesarani|2016|pp=153–155}} In August, [[Adolf Eichmann]] was put in charge of the [[Central Agency for Jewish Emigration in Vienna|Central Agency for Jewish Emigration]]. About 100,000 Austrian Jews had left the country by May 1939, including [[Sigmund Freud]] and his family.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=659–661}}

The [[Évian Conference]] was held in July 1938 by 32 countries as an attempt to help the increased refugees from Germany, but aside from establishing the largely ineffectual [[Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees]], little was accomplished and most countries participating did not increase the number of refugees they would accept.{{sfn|Niewyk|Nicosia|2000|p=200}}

[[File:Burning Synagoge Kristallnacht 1938.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The synagogue in [[Siegen]] burning, 10 November 1938.]]
On 7 November 1938, [[Herschel Grynszpan]], a Polish Jew, shot the German diplomat [[Ernst vom Rath]] in the German Embassy in Paris, in retaliation for the expulsion of his parents and siblings from Germany.{{sfn|Cesarani|2016|pp=181}}{{efn|The French had planned to try Grynszpan for murder, but the German invasion in 1940 interrupted the proceedings.

The government claimed it was spontaneous, but in fact it had been ordered and planned by Hitler and [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]], although with no clear goals, according to [[David Cesarani]]; the result, he writes, was "murder, rape, looting, destruction of property, and terror on an unprecedented scale".{{sfn|Cesarani|2016|p=183}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=581–582}}

Known as ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (or "Night of Broken Glass"), the attacks were partly carried out by the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and [[Sturmabteilung|SA]],{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=583–584}} but ordinary Germans joined in; in some areas the violence began before the SS or SA arrived.{{sfn|Bloxham|2009|p=168}} Over 7,500 Jewish shops (out of 9,000) were looted and attacked, and over 1,000 [[synagogue]]s damaged or destroyed.

[[File:Germany1941.png|thumb|upright=1.1|Nazi Germany before [[Operation Barbarossa]] of 1941, including [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|occupied Poland]] and the [[General Government]] territory]]

When Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] in September 1939, it gained control of about 2 million Jews in the occupied territory. The rest of Poland was [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union#Soviet occupation of Poland, 1939–1941|occupied by the Soviet Union]], which had control of the rest of Poland's pre-war population of 3.3–3.5 million Jews.{{sfn|Crowe|2008|pp=158–159}} German plans for Poland included expelling gentile Poles from large areas, confining Jews, and settling Germans on the emptied lands. To help the process along, [[Reinhard Heydrich]], head of the [[Reich Security Main Office]], ordered that the "leadership class" in Poland be killed and the Jews expelled from the [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany]].{{sfn|Bergen|2016|pp=136–137}}

The Germans initiated a policy of sending Jews from all territories they had recently annexed (Austria, Czechoslovakia, and western Poland) to the central section of Poland, which they called the [[General Government]]. There the Jews were concentrated in [[Ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe|ghettos]] in major cities,{{sfn|Black|2016|p=29}} chosen for their railway lines to facilitate later deportation.{{sfn|Browning|2004|pp=111–113}} Food supplies were restricted, public hygiene was difficult, and the inhabitants were often subjected to [[forced labour]].{{sfn|Black|2016|pp=29–30}} In the labour camps and ghettos at least half a million Jews died of starvation, disease, and poor living conditions.{{sfn|Bergen|2016|p=146}} [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] writes that the ghettos were not intended, in 1939, as a step towards the extermination of the Jews. Instead, they were viewed as part of a policy of creating a territorial reservation to contain them.{{sfn|Black|2016|p=31}}{{efn|After the invasion of Poland, the Germans planned to set up a Jewish reservation in southeast Poland around the transit camp in [[Nisko]], but the "Nisko Plan" failed, in part because it was opposed by [[Hans Frank]], the new Governor-General of the General Government territory.{{sfn|Black|2016|p=31}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%205965.pdf |title=Nisko and Lublin Plan |publisher= [[Yad Vashem]] |work=Holocaust Resource Center |accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Cesarani|2016|p=264}} Adolf Eichmann was assigned to remove Jews from Germany, Austria, and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] to the reservation.{{sfn|Cesarani|2004|pp=77–79}} Although the idea was to remove 80,000 Jews, Eichmann had managed to send only 4,700 by March 1940, and the plan was abandoned in April.{{sfn|Cesarani|2004|pp=259–260, 280, 288}} By mid-October the idea of a Jewish reservation had been revived by Heinrich Himmler, because of the influx of [[Volksdeutsche|Germanic settlers]] into the [[Warthegau]].{{sfn|Cesarani|2016|pp=261–263}} Resettlement continued until January 1941 under [[Odilo Globocnik]],{{sfn|Cesarani|2004|p=266}} and included both Jews and Poles.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=156-159}} By that time 95,000 Jews were already concentrated in the area,{{sfn|Edelheit|1994|p=52}} but the plan to deport up to 600,000 additional Jews to the [[Lublin reservation]] failed for logistical and political reasons.{{sfn|Cesarani|2016|p=262}}}}

Germany [[Norwegian Campaign|invaded Norway]] in April 1940. The country was completely occupied by June.{{sfn|Bergen|2016|p=169}} There were about 1,800 Jews in Norway, persecuted by the Norwegian Nazis. In late 1940, the Jews were banned from some occupations, and in 1941 all Jews had to register their property with the government.{{sfn|McKale|2002|p=162}} Also in 1940, [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|Germany invaded Denmark]].{{sfn|Bergen|2016|p=169}} The country was overrun so quickly that there was no chance of organizing resistance. Consequently, the Danish government stayed in power and the Germans found it easier to work through it. Because of this, few measures were taken against the Danish Jews before 1942.{{sfn|McKale|2002|p=161}}

The Germans [[Battle of the Netherlands|invaded the Netherlands]], Luxembourg, Belgium, and [[Battle of France|France]] in May 1940. In the Netherlands, the Germans installed [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] as ''[[Reichskommissar]]'', who quickly began to persecute the approximately 140,000 Dutch Jews. Jews were forced out of their jobs and had to register with the government. Non-Jewish Dutch citizens protested these measures and in February 1941 staged a strike that was quickly crushed.{{sfn|McKale|2002|pp=162–163}} After Belgium's surrender at the end of May 1940, it was ruled by a German military governor, [[Alexander von Falkenhausen]], who enacted anti-Jewish measures against the approximately 90,000 Jews in Belgium, many of whom were refugees from Germany or Eastern Europe.{{sfn|McKale|2002|p=164}} France had approximately 300,000 Jews, divided between the German-occupied northern part of France, and the unoccupied collaborationist southern areas under the [[Vichy regime]]. The occupied regions were under the control of a military governor, and there, anti-Jewish measures were not enacted as quickly as they were in the Vichy-controlled areas.{{sfn|McKale|2002|pp=165–166}} In July 1940, the Jews in the parts of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] that had been annexed to Germany were expelled into Vichy France.{{sfn|Zuccotti|1993|p=52}}

[[Invasion of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Battle of Greece|Greece]] were invaded in April 1941, and both countries surrendered before the end of the month. Germany and Italy divided Greece into occupation zones but did not eliminate it as a country. Yugoslavia was dismembered, with regions in the north being annexed by Germany, and regions along the coast made part of Italy. The rest of the country was divided into a [[Independent State of Croatia|puppet state of Croatia]], which was nominally an ally of Germany, and [[Serbia]], which was governed by a combination of military and police administrators. There were approximately 80,000 Jews in Yugoslavia when it was invaded. The ruling party in Croatia, the [[Ustashe]], not only killed Jews but murdered and expelled Orthodox Christian Serbs and Muslims.{{sfn|McKale|2002|pp=192–193}} One difference between the Germans and the Croatians was the fact that the Ustashe allowed its Jewish and Serbian victims to convert to Catholicism so they could escape death. Serbia was declared free of Jews in August 1942.{{sfn|Black|2016|p=134}}

===Germany's allies===
Italy introduced some antisemitic measures, but there was less antisemitism there than in Germany, and Italian-occupied countries were generally safer for Jews than German-occupied territories. In some areas, the Italian authorities even tried to protect Jews, such as in the Croatian areas of the Balkans. But while Italian forces in Russia were not as vicious towards Jews as the Germans, they did not try to stop German atrocities either. There were no deportations of Italian Jews to Germany while Italy remained an ally.{{sfn|Black|2016|pp=137–139}} Several forced labor camps for Jews were established in [[Italian Libya|Italian-controlled Libya]]. Almost 2,600 [[History of the Jews in Libya|Libyan Jews]] were sent to camps, where 562 died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ochayon, Sheryl |title=The Jews of Libya |work=The International School for Holocaust Studies |url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/education/newsletter/25/jews_libya.asp |publisher=[[Yad Vashem]] |accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vichy France's government implemented anti-Jewish measures in [[French Algeria]] and the two French Protectorates of [[French Protectorate of Tunisia|Tunisia]] and [[French protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]].{{sfn|Bauer|2001|pp=256–257}} Tunisia had 85,000 Jews when the Germans and Italians arrived in November 1942.

[[File:פוגרום יאשי 5.jpg|thumb|Bodies being pulled out of a death train carrying Romanian Jews from the [[Iași pogrom]]]]

Romania implemented anti-Jewish measures in May and June 1940 as part of its efforts towards an alliance with Germany. Jews were forced from government service, pogroms were carried out, and by March 1941 all Jews had lost their jobs and had their property confiscated.{{sfn|Black|2016|pp=131–133}} After Romania joined the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, at least 13,266 Jews were killed in the [[Iași pogrom]],{{sfn|Friling|Ioanid|Ionesc|2004|pp=125–126}} and Romanian troops carried out massacres in Romanian-controlled territory, including the [[1941 Odessa massacre|Odessa massacre]] of 20,000 Jews in [[Odessa]] in late 1941. Romania also set up concentration camps under its control in [[Transnistria]], where 154,000–170,000 Jews were deported from 1941 to 1943.{{sfn|Black|2016|pp=131–133}}

Anti-Jewish measures were introduced in Slovakia, which would later deport its Jews to German concentration and extermination camps.{{sfn|Black|2016|pp=134–135}} Bulgaria introduced anti-Jewish measures in 1940 and 1941, including the requirement to wear a yellow star, the banning of mixed marriages, and the loss of property. Bulgaria annexed Thrace and Macedonia, and in February 1943 agreed to deport 20,000 Jews to [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]]. All 11,000 Jews from the annexed territories were sent to their deaths, and plans were made to deport additional 6,000–8,000 Bulgarian Jews from Sofia to meet the quota.&lt;!--what quota?--&gt;{{sfn|Rozett|Spector|2013|p=161}} When the plans became public, the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] and many Bulgarians protested, and King [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Boris III]] canceled the deportation of Jews native to Bulgaria.{{sfn|Black|2016|pp=136–137}} Instead, they were expelled to the interior, pending further decision.{{sfn|Rozett|Spector|2013|p=161}} Although Hungary expelled Jews who were not citizens from its newly annexed lands in 1941, it did not deport most of its Jews{{sfn|Black|2016|p=135}} until the German invasion of Hungary in March 1944. Between 15 May and 9 July 1944, 440,000 Hungarian Jews were deported to Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Braham|2011|p=45}}; {{harvnb|Berenbaum|2002|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Budapest, nearly 80,000 Jews were killed by the Hungarian [[Arrow Cross Party|Arrow Cross battalions]] in late 1944.{{sfn|Rozett|Spector|2013|p=274}}

&lt;!--section needs a rewrite--&gt;

The Third Reich first used concentration camps as places of unlawful incarceration of political opponents and other "enemies of the state". Large numbers of Jews were not sent there until after ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in November 1938.{{sfn|Baumel|2001|p=135}} Although death rates were high, the camps were not designed as killing centers.{{sfn|Fischel|2010|pp=50–52}} After war broke out in 1939, new camps were established, some outside Germany in occupied Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005144 |title=Nazi Camps |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1945, the SS reports had over 700,000 prisoners in their control, of which close to half had died by the end of May 1945 according to most historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007387 |title=Concentration Camp System: In Depth |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most wartime prisoners of the camps were not Germans but belonged to countries under German occupation.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=287–288}} It is estimated that the Germans established over 42,000 detention sites throughout Europe, including ghettos, concentration camps, prisoner-of-war camps, labour camps, and extermination camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/research/publications/encyclopedia-camps-ghettos |title= Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933–1945 |work=Publications |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1942, the economic functions of the camps, previously secondary to their penal and terror functions, came to the fore. Forced labour of camp prisoners became commonplace and companies utilized their cheap labour.{{sfn|Baumel|2001|p=135}} The guards became much more brutal, and the death rate increased as the guards not only beat and starved prisoners, but killed them more frequently.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=287–288}} [[Extermination through labour]] was a policy—camp inmates would literally be worked to death, or to physical exhaustion, at which point they would be gassed or shot.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=314–320}} The Germans estimated the average prisoner's lifespan in a concentration camp at three months, due to lack of food and clothing, constant epidemics, and frequent punishments for the most minor transgressions.{{sfn|Black|2016|p=76}} The shifts were long and often involved exposure to dangerous materials.{{sfn|Black|2016|p=104}}

Prisoner transportation between camps was often carried out in freight cars with the prisoners packed very tightly. Long delays would take place, with the prisoners confined in the cars on sidings for days.{{sfn|Rozett|1990|p=1222}} In mid-1942 labor camps began requiring newly arrived prisoners to be placed in quarantine for four weeks.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=347}} Some camps [[Identification in Nazi camps|tattooed prisoners]] with an identification number on arrival, but not all did.{{sfn|Harran|2000|p=461}} Prisoners wore [[Nazi concentration camp badge|colored triangles]] on their uniforms, with the color of the triangle denoting the reason for their incarceration. Red signified a political prisoner, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] had purple triangles, "asocials" and criminals wore black or green. Badges were pink for gay men and yellow for Jews.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=125–127, 623}} Jews had a second yellow triangle that was worn with their original triangle, with the two forming a six-pointed star.{{sfn|Yahil|1990|p=134}}{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=119}}

[[File:Stroop Report - Warsaw Ghetto Uprising 06b.jpg|thumb|[[Polish Jews]] captured by Germans during the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], May 1943]]
After invading Poland, the Germans established ghettos in the incorporated territories and General Government to confine Jews.{{sfn|Black|2016|p=29}} The ghettos were formed and closed off from the outside world at different times and for different reasons.{{sfn|Browning|1986|pp=345–348}}{{sfn|Hilberg|2003|pp=216–7}} For example, the Łódź ghetto was closed in April 1940,{{sfn|Black|2016|p=29}} to force the Jews inside to give up money and valuables;{{sfn|Yahil|1990|p=166}} the Warsaw ghetto was closed for health considerations (for the people outside, not inside, the ghetto),{{sfn|Yahil|1990|p=169}} but this did not happen until November 1940;{{sfn|Black|2016|p=29}} and the Kraków ghetto was not established until March 1941.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=161}} The Warsaw Ghetto contained 380,000 people{{sfn|Black|2016|p=29}} and was the largest ghetto in Poland; the Łódź Ghetto was the second largest,{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=167}} holding between 160,000{{sfn|Yahil|1990|p=165}} to 223,000.{{sfn|Bergen|2016|p=148}} Because of the long drawn-out process of establishing ghettos, it is unlikely that they were originally considered part of a systematic attempt to eliminate Jews completely.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=166}}

The Germans required each ghetto to be run by a ''[[Judenrat]]'', or Jewish council.{{sfn|Trunk|1996|pp=1–6}} Councils were responsible for a ghetto's day-to-day operations, including distributing food, water, heat, medical care, and shelter. The Germans also required councils to confiscate property, organize forced labor, and, finally, facilitate deportations to extermination camps.&lt;!--check this--&gt;{{sfn|Hilberg|1993|p=106}} The councils' basic strategy was one of trying to minimize losses, by cooperating with German authorities, bribing officials, and petitioning for better conditions or clemency.&lt;!--check this--&gt;{{sfn|Hilberg|1993|p=170}}

[[File:Zwłoki dzieci getto warszawskie 05.jpg|thumb|left|Bodies of children in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]]]]
Eventually, the Germans ordered the councils to compile lists of names of deportees to be sent for "resettlement".{{sfn|Bergen|2016|pp=150–152}} Although most ghetto councils complied with these orders,{{sfn|Hilberg|1980|p=104}} many councils tried to send the least useful workers or those unable to work.{{sfn|Bergen|2016|pp=150–151}} Leaders who refused these orders were shot. Some individuals or even complete councils committed suicide rather than cooperate with the deportations.{{sfn|Berenbaum|2006|pp=81–83}} Others, like [[Chaim Rumkowski]], who became the "dedicated autocrat" of Łódź,&lt;!--check this--&gt;{{sfn|Hilberg|1993|p=109}} argued that their responsibility was to save the Jews who could be saved and that therefore others had to be sacrificed.{{sfn|Berenbaum|2006|pp=79–81}} The councils' actions in facilitating Germany's persecution and murder of ghetto inhabitants was important to the Germans.{{sfn|Hilberg|2003|p=1111}} When cooperation crumbled, as happened in the Warsaw ghetto after the Jewish Combat Organisation displaced the council's authority, the Germans lost control.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=285}}

Ghettos were intended to be temporary until the Jews were deported to other locations, which never happened. Instead, the inhabitants were sent to extermination camps. The ghettos were, in effect, immensely crowded prisons serving as instruments of "slow, passive murder."{{sfn|Berenbaum|2006|p=114}} Though the Warsaw Ghetto contained 30% of Warsaw's population, it occupied only 2.5% of the city's area, averaging over 9 people per room.{{sfn|Dwork|van Pelt|2003|p=239}} Between 1940 and 1942, starvation and disease, especially [[typhoid fever|typhoid]], killed many in the ghettos.{{sfn|Dwork|van Pelt|2003|pp=242–243}} Over 43,000 Warsaw ghetto residents, or one in ten of the total population, died in 1941;&lt;ref name=USHMMDepoWar&gt;{{cite web |title= Deportations to and from the Warsaw Ghetto |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005413 |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=[[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] |accessdate= 27 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Theresienstadt]], more than half the residents died in 1942.{{sfn|Berenbaum|2006|p=114}}

Himmler ordered the closing of ghettos in Poland in mid-July 1942, with most inhabitants going to extermination camps. Those Jews needed for war production would be confined at concentration camps.{{sfn|Yahil|1990|p=378}} The deportations from the Warsaw Ghetto began on 22 July; over the almost two months of the ''Aktion'', until 12 September, the Warsaw ghetto went from approximately 350,000 inhabitants to about 65,000. Those deported were [[Holocaust trains|transported in freight trains]] to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].{{sfn|Yahil|1990|pp=378–380}} Similar deportations happened in other ghettos, with many ghettos totally emptied.{{sfn|Yahil|1990|pp=382–385}}

The first [[ghetto uprising]]s occurred in mid-1942 in small community ghettos.{{sfn|Yahil|1990|pp=474–478}} Although there were armed resistance attempts in both the larger and smaller ghettos in 1943, in every case they failed against the overwhelming German military force, and the remaining Jews were either killed or deported to the death camps.{{sfn|Berenbaum|2006|pp=175–177}}

A number of deadly pogroms occurred during the Holocaust.{{sfn|Yahil|1990|pp=163, 258}} The Germans encouraged some, and others were spontaneous.{{sfn|Bergen|2016|p=195}} Some, such as the [[Iaşi pogrom]], were in lands controlled by Germany's allies.{{sfn|Dwork|van Pelt|2003|pp=267–269}} In the series of [[Lviv pogroms]] committed in [[occupied Poland]],{{efn|Some scholars say they were orchestrated by the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]],{{sfn|Amar|2015|p=99}} other scholars are less sure.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=194}} }} some 6,000 [[Polish Jews]] were murdered in the streets in July 1941, on top of 3,000 arrests and mass shootings by ''Einsatzgruppe C''.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=194}} During the [[Jedwabne pogrom]] of July 1941, in the presence of the German officers, several hundred Jews were murdered by some local Poles, with some being burned alive in a barn.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=196}}{{efn|The exact details of who killed whom and when are murky and have led to much debate in Poland.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=196}} }}

Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.{{sfn|Evans|1989|p=59}} German propaganda portrayed the war against the Soviet Union as both an ideological war between German National Socialism and Jewish Bolshevism and a racial war between the Germans and the Jewish, Romani and Slavic ''[[Untermenschen]]'' ("sub-humans").{{sfn|Burleigh|2001|pp=512, 526–527}}

[[File:Einsatzgruppe shooting.jpg|thumb|left|German police shooting women and children from the [[Mizocz Ghetto]], 14 October 1942]]

Local populations in some occupied Soviet territories actively participated in the killings of Jews and others. Besides participating in killings and pogroms, they helped identify Jews for persecution and rounded up Jews for German actions.{{sfn|Matthäus|2004|p=268}} German involvement ranged from active instigation and involvement to more generalized guidance.{{sfn|Matthäus|2004|p=275}} In Lithuania, Latvia, and western Ukraine locals were deeply involved in the murder of Jews from the beginning of the German occupation. Some of these Latvian and Lithuanian units also participated in the murder of Jews in Belarus. In the south, Ukrainians killed about 24,000 Jews and some went to Poland to serve as concentration and death-camp guards.{{sfn|Matthäus|2004|p=268}} Military units from some countries allied to Germany also killed Jews. Romanian units were given orders to exterminate and wipe out Jews in areas they controlled.{{sfn|Matthäus|2004|pp=275–276}} [[Ustaše militia]] in [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] persecuted and murdered Jews, among others.{{sfn|Black|2016|p=134}} Many of the killings were carried out in public, a change from previous practice.{{sfn|Matthäus|2004|pp=270–271}}

The mass killings of Jews in the occupied Soviet territories were assigned to four SS formations called ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' ("task groups"), which were under Heydrich's overall command. Similar formations had been used to a limited extent in Poland in 1939, but the ones operating in the Soviet territories were much larger.{{sfn|Browning|2004|pp=224–225}} The ''Einsatzgruppen''{{'s}} commanders were ordinary citizens: the great majority were professionals and most were intellectuals.{{sfn|Hilberg|2003|p=291}} By the winter of 1941–1942, the four ''Einsatzgruppen'' and their helpers had killed almost 500,000 people.{{sfn|Fischel|2010|p=67}}

[[File:Liepaja December 1941 massacres 01.jpeg|thumb|The [[Liepāja massacres|mass murder of 2,749 Jews]] on the beach near Liepāja, [[Latvia]], 15–17 December 1941]]
The largest massacre of Jews by the mobile killing squads in the Soviet Union was at a ravine called [[Babi Yar]] outside [[Kiev]],{{sfn|Bergen|2016|pp=199–200}} where 33,771 Jews were killed in a single operation on 29–30 September 1941.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=226–227}}{{efn|The Germans continued to use the ravine for mass killings throughout the war, and the total killed there could have been as high as 100,000.{{sfn|Bergen|2016|p=199}} }} A mixture of SS and Security Police, assisted by Ukrainian police, carried out the killings.{{sfn|McKale|2002|p=203}} Although they did not actively participate in the killings, men of the German [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th Army]] helped round up the Jews of Kiev and transport them to be shot.{{sfn|Fritz|2011|pp=102–104}} By the end of the war, around two million are thought to have been victims of the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and their helpers in the local population and the German Army. Of those, about 1.3 million were Jews and up to a quarter of a million Roma.{{sfn|Bergen|2016|p=200}}

===Gas vans===
As the mass shootings continued in Russia, the Germans began to search for new methods of mass murder. This was driven by a need to have a more efficient method than simply shooting millions of victims. Himmler also feared that the mass shootings were causing psychological problems in the SS. His concerns were shared by his subordinates in the field.{{sfn|Fischel|1998|pp=42–43}} In December 1939 and January 1940, another method besides shooting was tried. Experimental [[gas van]]s equipped with gas cylinders and a sealed compartment were used to kill the disabled and mentally-ill in [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupied Poland]].{{sfn|Bergen|2016|p=160}} Similar vans, but using the exhaust fumes rather than bottled gas, were introduced to the [[Chełmno extermination camp]] in December 1941,{{sfn|Gerlach|2016|p=74}} and some were used in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|occupied Soviet Union]], for example in smaller clearing actions in the [[Minsk ghetto]].{{sfn|Cesarani|2016|p=513}} They also were used for murder in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Arad|2009|p=138}}

==Final Solution==
===Wannsee Conference===
{{further|Wannsee Conference|Final solution}}
[[File:Wannsee Conference - List of Jews in European countries.JPG|thumb|left|Copy of the [[Wannsee Conference]] minutes; this page lists the number of Jews in every European country.]]

SS-''[[Obergruppenführer]]'' [[Reinhard Heydrich]], head of the [[Reich Main Security Office]] (''Reichssicherheitshauptamt'' or RSHA), convened what became known as the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942 at a villa, am Grossen Wannsee No. 56/58, in Berlin's [[Wannsee]] suburb.{{sfn|Gerlach|1998|p=759}}&lt;ref name=protocol/&gt;&lt;ref name=USHMMWannsee&gt;[https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005477 "Wannsee Conference and the 'Final Solution'"], ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'', United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Retrieved 8 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting had been scheduled for 9 December 1941, and invitations had been sent on 29 November, but it had been postponed.{{sfn|Gerlach|1998|p=764}} [[Christian Gerlach]] argues that Hitler announced his decision to annihilate the Jews on or around 12 December 1941, probably on 12 December during a speech to Nazi Party leaders. This was one day after he [[German declaration of war against the United States (1941)|declared war on the United States]] and five days after the [[attack on Pearl Harbour]] by Japan. [[Joseph Goebbels]], the [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Reich Minister of Propaganda]], noted of Hitler's speech: "He warned the Jews that if they were to cause another world war, it would lead to their destruction.&amp;nbsp;... Now the world war has come. The destruction of the Jews must be its necessary consequence."{{sfn|Gerlach|2016|p=80}}{{efn|Goebbels noted: "Regarding the Jewish question, the Fuhrer is determined to clear the table. He warned the Jews that if they were to cause another world war, it would lead to their own destruction. Those were not empty words. Now the world war has come. The destruction of the Jews must be its necessary consequence. We cannot be sentimental about it. It is not for us to feel sympathy for the Jews. We should have sympathy rather with our own German people. If the German people have to sacrifice 160,000 victims in yet another campaign in the east, then those responsible for this bloody conflict will have to pay for it with their lives."{{sfn|Gerlach|1998|p=122}}}}

The 15 men present at Wannsee included [[Adolf Eichmann]] (head of Jewish affairs for the RSHA and the man who organized the deportation of Jews), [[Heinrich Müller (Gestapo)|Heinrich Müller]] (head of the Gestapo), and other party leaders and department heads.&lt;ref name=protocol&gt;{{cite web |title=Wannsee Protocol, January 20, 1942 |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/wannsee.asp |website=The Avalon Project |publisher=Yale Law School |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816163214/http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/wannsee.asp |archivedate=16 August 2018|dead-url=no}}{{pb}}

Copy no.&amp;nbsp;16 was found by American prosecutors in March 1947 in a German Foreign Office folder.{{sfn|Roseman|2003}}&lt;!--add page number--&gt; Written by Eichmann and stamped "Top Secret", the minutes were written in "euphemistic language" on Heydrich's instructions, according to Eichmann's later testimony.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=306}} The conference had several purposes. Discussing plans for a "[[Final solution|final solution to the Jewish question]]" ("''Endlösung der Judenfrage''"), and a "final solution to the Jewish question in Europe" ("''Endlösung der europäischen Judenfrage''"),&lt;ref name=protocol/&gt; it was intended to share information and responsibility, coordinate efforts and policies ("''Parallelisierung der Linienführung''"), and ensure that authority rested with Heydrich. There was also discussion about whether to include the German ''Mischlinge'' (half-Jews).{{sfn|Gerlach|2016|pp=84–85}} Heydrich told the meeting: "Another possible solution of the problem has now taken the place of emigration, i.e. the evacuation of the Jews to the East, provided that the Fuehrer gives the appropriate approval in advance."&lt;ref name=protocol/&gt; He continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Under proper guidance, in the course of the final solution the Jews are to be allocated for appropriate labor in the East. Able-bodied Jews, separated according to sex, will be taken in large work columns to these areas for work on roads, in the course of which action doubtless a large portion will be eliminated by natural causes.{{pb}} The possible final remnant will, since it will undoubtedly consist of the most resistant portion, have to be treated accordingly because it is the product of natural selection and would, if released, act as the seed of a new Jewish revival (see the experience of history.) In the course of the practical execution of the final solution, Europe will be combed through from west to east. Germany proper, including the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, will have to be handled first due to the housing problem and additional social and political necessities. The evacuated Jews will first be sent, group by group, to so-called transit ghettos, from which they will be transported to the East.&lt;ref name=protocol/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These evacuations were regarded as provisional or "temporary solutions" ("''Ausweichmöglichkeiten''").{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=307}}{{efn|[[Wannsee Conference|Wannsee-Protokoll]]: "Diese Aktionen sind jedoch lediglich als Ausweichmöglichkeiten anzusprechen, doch werden hier bereits jene praktischen Erfahrungen gesammelt, die im Hinblick auf die kommende Endlösung der Judenfrage von wichtiger Bedeutung sind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eudocs.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Wannsee-Protokoll |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622052218/http://eudocs.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Wannsee-Protokoll |dead-url=no |archive-date=22 June 2006 |title=Wannsee-Protokoll |work=EuroDocs |publisher=Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pb}}
Translation, [[Avalon Project]]: "These actions are, however, only to be considered provisional, but practical experience is already being collected which is of the greatest importance in relation to the future final solution of the Jewish question."&lt;ref name=protocol/&gt;}} The final solution would encompass the 11{{nbsp}}million Jews living not only in territories controlled by Germany, but elsewhere in Europe and adjacent territories, such as Britain, Ireland, Switzerland, Turkey, Sweden, Portugal, Spain, and Hungary, "dependent on military developments".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=307}} There was little doubt what the final solution was, writes [[Peter Longerich]]: "the Jews were to be annihilated by a combination of forced labour and mass murder".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=308}}

===Extermination camps, gas chambers===

[[File:Auschwitz-birkenau-main track.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Entrance to Auschwitz II-Birkenau, an extermination camp]]
Killing on a mass scale using gas chambers or gas vans was the main difference between the [[Extermination camp|extermination]] and [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]]s.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=153}} From the end of 1941, the Germans built six extermination camps in occupied Poland: [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz II-Birkenau]], [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]], [[Chełmno extermination camp|Chełmno]], and the three [[Operation Reinhard]] camps at [[Belzec extermination camp|Belzec]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]], and [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka II]].&lt;ref name=deathcamps/&gt;&lt;ref name=USHMMTreblinka&gt;{{cite web |title= Treblinka | work=Holocaust Encyclopedia | url= https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005193 |publisher= United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aktr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%205724.pdf |title=Aktion Reinhard |work=Holocaust Resource Center |publisher=Yad Vashem |accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maly Trostenets extermination camp|Maly Trostenets]], a concentration camp in the [[Reichskommissariat Ostland]], became a killing centre in 1942.&lt;ref name=deathcamps/&gt; Gerlach writes that over three million Jews were murdered in 1942, the year that "marked the peak" of the mass murder of Jews.{{sfn|Gerlach|2016|p=99}} At least 1.4 million of these were in the General Government area of Poland.{{sfn|Gerlach|2016|p=99, note 165}}

Using gas vans, Chełmno had its roots in the [[Aktion T4]] euthanasia program.{{sfn|Montague|2012|pp=14–16, 64–65}} Majdanek began as a POW camp, but in August 1942 it had gas chambers installed.{{sfn|Black|2016|pp=70–71}} A few other camps are occasionally named as extermination camps, but there is no scholarly agreement on the additional camps; commonly mentioned are [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]] in Austria{{sfn|Fischel|2010|pp=57–58}} and [[Stutthof]].{{sfn|Fischel|1998|p=81}} There may also have been plans for camps at Mogilev and Lvov.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=282}}

[[File:Auschwitz Resistance 282 cropped.JPG|thumb|left|One of the [[Sonderkommando photographs]] shows women being sent to the gas chamber, Auschwitz-Birkenau, August 1944.]]
Victims usually arrived at the camps by train.{{sfn|Fischel|1998|pp=81–85}} Almost all arrivals at the Operation Reinhard camps of Treblinka, Sobibór, and Bełżec were sent directly to the gas chambers,{{sfn|Black|2016|pp=69–70}} with individuals occasionally selected to replace dead workers.{{sfn|Crowe|2008|p=243}}{{sfn|Arad|1987|p=98}} At Auschwitz, the camp officials usually subjected individuals to selections.{{sfn|Fischel|1998|pp=81–82}} About 25%&lt;!--which Bauer is this?--&gt;{{sfn|Bauer|1994|p=156}} of the new arrivals deemed fit to work were sent to slave labour.{{sfn|Fischel|1998|pp=81–82}} Those selected for death at all camps were told to undress and hand their valuables to camp workers.{{sfn|Dwork|van Pelt|2003|pp=287–288}} They were then herded naked into the gas chambers. To prevent panic, they were told the gas chambers were showers or delousing chambers.{{sfn|Piper|1998b|p=173}} The procedure at Chełmno was slightly different. Victims there were placed in a mobile gas van and asphyxiated, while being driven to prepared burial pits in the nearby forests. There the corpses were unloaded and buried.{{sfn|Montague|2012|pp=76–85}}

At Auschwitz, after the chambers were filled, the doors were shut and pellets of [[Zyklon-B]] were dropped into the chambers through vents,{{sfn|Piper|1998b|p=162}} releasing toxic prussic acid, or [[hydrogen cyanide]].{{sfn|Piper|1998b|p=157}} Those inside died within 20 minutes; the speed of death depended on how close the inmate was standing to a gas vent, according to the commandant [[Rudolf Höss]], who estimated that about one-third of the victims died immediately.{{sfn|Piper|1998b|p=170}} Johann Kremer, an SS doctor who oversaw the gassings, testified that: "Shouting and screaming of the victims could be heard through the opening and it was clear that they fought for their lives."{{sfn|Piper|1998b|p=163}} The gas was then pumped out, the bodies were removed, gold fillings in their teeth were extracted, and women's hair was cut.{{sfn|Piper|1998b|pp=170–171}} The work was done by the ''[[Sonderkommando]],'' work groups of mostly Jewish prisoners.{{sfn|Piper|1998b|p=172}} At Auschwitz, the bodies were at first buried in deep pits and covered with lime, but between September and November 1942, on the orders of Himmler, they were dug up and burned. In early 1943, new gas chambers and crematoria were built to accommodate the numbers.{{sfn|Piper|1998b|pp=163–164}}

At the three Reinhard camps the victims were killed by the exhaust fumes of stationary diesel engines.{{sfn|Black|2016|pp=69–70}} Gold fillings were pulled from the corpses before burial, but the women's hair was cut before death. At Treblinka, to calm the victims, the arrival platform was made to look like a train station, complete with fake clock.{{sfn|Fischel|1998|pp=83–84}} Majdanek used Zyklon-B gas in its gas chambers.{{sfn|Fischel|1998|pp=84–85}} In contrast to Auschwitz, the three Reinhard camps were quite small.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=330}} Most of the victims at these camps were buried in pits at first. Sobibór and Bełżec began exhuming and burning bodies in late 1942, to hide the evidence, as did Treblinka in March 1943. The bodies were burned in open fireplaces and the remaining bones crushed into powder.{{sfn|Arad|1987|pp=170–171}}

===Jewish resistance===
{{Main|Jewish resistance in German-occupied Europe}}
[[Peter Longerich]] observes that in ghettos in Poland by the end of 1942, "there was practically no resistance".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=340–341}} [[Raul Hilberg]] accounts for this compliant attitude by evoking the [[Persecution of Jews|history of Jewish persecution]]: as had been the case before, appealing to their oppressors and complying with orders might avoid inflaming the situation until the onslaught abated.{{sfn|Hilberg|2003|pp=1112–1128}}{{efn|[[Henri Michel]] argues that resistance consisted not only of physical opposition but of any activity that gave the Jews dignity and humanity in humiliating and inhumane conditions. Bauer defines resistance as actions that in any way opposed the German directives, laws, or conduct.{{sfn|Bauer|1997|p=117}} Hilberg cautions against overstating the extent of Jewish resistance, arguing that by turning isolated incidents into resistance, it elevates the slaughter of innocent people into some kind of battle, and diminishes the heroism of those who took active measures to resist the Germans. He asserts that the blending of the passive majority with the active few is a way of deflecting questions about the survival strategies and leadership of the Jewish community.{{sfn|Hilberg|1996|pp= 126–137}}}} Timothy Snyder notes that it was only during the three months after the deportations of July–September 1942 that agreement on the need for armed resistance was reached.{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=283}}{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=341}}

[[File:Stroop Report - Warsaw Ghetto Uprising 13.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Captured members of the Jewish resistance, Warsaw Ghetto, 1943.]]
Several groups were formed, such as the Jewish Fighting Organization in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] and the [[United Partisan Organization]] in Vilna.{{sfn|Black|2016|pp=82–85}} Over 100 revolts and uprisings occurred in at least 19 ghettos and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. The best known is the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of 1943, when around 1,000 poorly armed Jewish fighters held the SS at bay for four weeks.{{sfn|Black|2016|pp=83–84}}{{efn|According to Polish and Jewish accounts, hundreds or thousands of Germans were killed,{{sfn|Gutman|1994|p=243}} while the Germans reported 16 dead.{{sfn|Bergen|2016|p=269}} The Germans reported around 14,000 Jews killed{{efn|About 7000 died during the fighting and around 7000 sent to Treblinka.{{sfn|Cesarani|2016|p=616}} }} and between 53,000{{sfn|Cesarani|2016|p=636}} and 56,000 deported.{{sfn|Bergen|2016|p=269}}}} During a revolt in Treblinka on 2 August 1943, inmates killed five or six guards and set fire to camp buildings; several managed to escape.{{sfn|Arad|1987|pp=286, 293–294}}{{sfn|Fischel|1998|p=99}}

In the [[Białystok Ghetto Uprising|Białystok Ghetto]] on 16 August 1943, Jewish insurgents revolted when the Germans announced mass deportations.

===Flow of information about the mass murder===
{{Further|The New York Times#World War II}}
{{see also|The Black Book of Polish Jewry|The Polish White Book|The Black Book of Poland|Raczyński's Note|Witold's Report}}
[[File:The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied.pdf|thumb|upright|''[[The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland]]'' by the [[Polish government-in-exile]], addressed to the [[Declaration by United Nations|United Nations]], 10 December 1942]]

The [[Polish government-in-exile]] in London learned about the extermination camps from the Polish leadership in Warsaw, who from 1940 "received a continual flow of information about Auschwitz", according to historian [[Michael Fleming (historian)|Michael Fleming]].{{sfn|Fleming|2014a|p=35}} On 6 January 1942, the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], sent out diplomatic notes about German atrocities. The notes were based on reports about bodies surfacing from poorly covered graves in pits and quarries, as well as mass graves found in areas the [[Red Army]] had liberated, and on witness reports from German-occupied areas.{{sfn|Spector|1990|p=158}}

Escapes from the camps were few, but not unknown.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=532–533}} In February 1942, [[Szlama Ber Winer]] escaped from the Chełmno concentration camp in Poland, and passed detailed information about it to the [[Oyneg Shabbos (group)|Oneg Shabbat]] group in the Warsaw Ghetto. His report, known by his pseudonym as the [[Grojanowski Report]], had reached London by June 1942.&lt;ref name=yvChelmno/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Grojanowski Report |work=Shoah Resource Center|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%206317.pdf |publisher=[[Yad Vashem]]|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1942, [[Jan Karski]] reported to the Allies on the plight of Jews after being smuggled into the Warsaw Ghetto twice.{{sfn|Crowe|2008|p=354}}{{sfn|Niewyk|Nicosia|2000|p=183}}{{efn|Some reports have Karski infiltrating Bełżec disguised as a guard,{{sfn|Lukas|2012|p=159}} but other sources state that he smuggled himself into a transit camp where Jews were sent on to Bełżec.{{sfn|Niewyk|Nicosia|2000|p=183}} }} On 27 April 1942, [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] sent out another note about atrocities.{{sfn|Spector|1990|p=158}} In late July or early August 1942, Polish leaders learned about the mass killings taking place inside Auschwitz. The Polish Interior Ministry prepared a report, ''Sprawozdanie 6/42'',{{sfn|Fleming|2014a|p=35}}{{sfn|Fleming|2014b|p=144}} which said at the end:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are different methods of execution. People are shot by firing squads, killed by an "air hammer", and poisoned by gas in special gas chambers. Prisoners condemned to death by the Gestapo are murdered by the first two methods. The third method, the gas chamber, is employed for those who are ill or incapable of work and those who have been brought in transports especially for the purpose/Soviet prisoners of war, and, recently Jews.{{sfn|Fleming|2014a|p=35}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:The Black Book of Poland (21–24).jpg|thumb|left|Photos from ''[[The Black Book of Poland]]'', published in London in 1942 by the [[Polish government-in-exile]]]]
The report was sent to Polish officials in London by courier and had reached them by 12 November 1942, when it was translated into English and added to another report, "Report on Conditions in Poland". Dated 27 November, this was forwarded to the Polish Embassy in the United States.{{sfn|Fleming|2014a|p=35–36}} On 10 December 1942, the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister, [[Edward Bernard Raczyński|Edward Raczyński]], addressed the [[Declaration by United Nations|fledgling United Nations]] on the killings; the address was distributed with the title ''The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland''. He told them about the use of poison gas; about Treblinka, Bełżec and Sobibor; that the Polish underground had referred to them as extermination camps; and that tens of thousands of Jews had been killed in Bełżec in March and April 1942.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2015|p=181}} One in three Jews in Poland were already dead, he estimated, from a population of 3,130,000.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2015|pp=181–182}} Raczyński's address was covered by the ''New York Times'' and ''The Times'' of London.&lt;!--lower case for NYT is intentional--&gt; [[Winston Churchill]] received it, and [[Anthony Eden]] presented it to the British cabinet. On 17 December 1942, 11 Allies issued the [[Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations]] condemning the "bestial policy of cold-blooded extermination".{{sfn|Zimmerman|2015|p=182}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper| url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00A1FFC3B5D167B93CAA81789D95F468485F9 |subscription=yes| title = 11 Allies Condemn Nazi War on Jews | date = 18 December 1942| newspaper = The New York Times}}{{pb}}

The report included details about the gas chambers, "selection", and the sterilization experiments. It said that there were three crematoria in Birkenau able to burn 10,000 people daily and that 30,000 people had been gassed in one day. According to [[Raul Hilberg]], the report was filed away with a note that there was no indication as to the source's reliability.{{sfn|Hilberg|2003|p=1212}}--&gt;

The British and American governments were reluctant to publicize the intelligence they had received. Although the information was felt to be correct, the stories were so extreme that they feared the public would discount them as exaggerations and that the credibility of both governments would be undermined.{{sfn|Novick|2000|p=23}} A BBC Hungarian Service memo, written by [[Carlile Aylmer Macartney|Carlile Macartney]], a BBC broadcaster and senior Foreign Office adviser on Hungary, stated in 1942: "We shouldn't mention the Jews at all." The British government's view was that the Hungarian people's antisemitism would make them distrust the Allies if Allied broadcasts focused on the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thomson |first1=Mike |title=Could the BBC have done more to help Hungarian Jews? |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20267659 |work=BBC News |date=13 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722192836/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20267659 |archivedate=22 July 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US government also hesitated to emphasize the atrocities for fear of turning the war into a war about the Jews. Antisemitism and isolationism were common in the US before its entry into the war, and the government wanted to avoid too great a focus on Jewish suffering to keep isolationism from gaining ground.{{sfn|Novick|2000|pp=27–28}}&lt;!--this needs to be updated--&gt;

Most historians define the Holocaust as the German genocide of the European Jews, carried out between 1941 and 1945.{{efn|name=definition}} Donald Niewyk and Francis Nicosia, writing in ''The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust'' (2000), favour a definition that focuses on the Jews, [[Romani genocide|Roma]] and handicapped ([[Aktion T4]] victims), because they were targets of Nazi efforts to destroy entire groups based on heredity.{{sfn|Niewyk|Nicosia|2000|p=52}}

The broadest definition of the Holocaust would include ethnic Poles, Soviet citizens, Soviet prisoners of war, gay men, and political opponents, and would raise the death toll to 17&amp;nbsp;million.{{sfn|Niewyk|Nicosia|2000|p=45}} A research project started in 2000, led by [[Geoffrey Megargee]] and [[Martin C.

The Jews killed represented around one third of the world population of Jews,{{sfn|Gilbert|2001|p=291}} and about two-thirds of European Jewry, based on an estimate of 9.7 million Jews in Europe at the start of the war.{{sfn|Fischel|1998|p=87}}{{sfn|Bauer|Rozett|1990|p=1799}} Much of the uncertainty stems from the lack of a reliable figure for the number of Jews in Europe in 1939, numerous border changes that make avoiding double-counting of victims difficult, lack of accurate records from the perpetrators, and uncertainty about whether deaths occurring months after liberation, but caused by the persecution, should be counted.{{sfn|Michman|2012|p=197}}

Almost all Jews within areas occupied by the Germans were killed. There were 3,020,000 Jews in the Soviet Union in 1939, and the losses were 1–1.1 million.{{sfn|Bauer|Rozett|1990|pp=1799–1802}} Around one million Jews were killed by the ''Einsatzgruppen'' in the occupied Soviet territories.{{sfn|Niewyk|Nicosia|2000|pp=221–222}}{{sfn|Rhodes|2002|p=274}} Of Poland's 3.3&amp;nbsp;million Jews, about 90 percent were killed.{{sfn|Polonsky|2001|p=488}} Many more died in the ghettos of Poland before they could be deported.{{sfn|Black|2016|pp=29–31}} The death camps accounted for half the number of Jews killed; 80–90 percent of death-camp victims are estimated to have been Jews.{{sfn|Dawidowicz|1986|p=403}}&lt;!-- need to double check these total figures --&gt; At [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]] the Jewish death toll was 1.1 million;&lt;ref name=yvAuschwitz/&gt;{{sfn|Piper|1998a|p=62}} [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] 870,000–925,000;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Treblinka |url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005193 |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bełżec extermination camp|Bełżec]] 434,000–600,000;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Belzec |url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005191| work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yvBelzec/&gt; [[Chełmno extermination camp|Chełmno]] 152,000–320,000;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chelmno |url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005194 |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yvChelmno/&gt; [[Sobibór extermination camp|Sobibór]] 170,000–250,000;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sobibor |url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005192 |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yvSob/&gt; and [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]] 79,000.&lt;ref name=yvMaj/&gt;

===Roma===
{{further|Porajmos|Antiziganism}}
Because the [[Romani people|Roma]] are traditionally a private people with a culture based on [[oral history]], less is known about their experience during the Holocaust than that of any other group.{{sfn|Niewyk|Nicosia|2000|p=47}} Bauer writes that this can be attributed to the Roma's distrust and suspicion, and to their humiliation because some of the taboos in Romani culture regarding hygiene and sex were violated at Auschwitz.{{sfn|Bauer|1998|p=453}}

The Roma were subject to discrimination under the Nuremberg racial laws.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=50}} The Germans saw them as hereditary criminals and "asocials", and this was reflected in their classification in the concentration camps, where they were usually counted among the asocials and given black triangles to wear.{{sfn|Evans|2015|pp=378–379}} According to Niewyk and Nicosia, at least 130,000 died, out of nearly one million in German-occupied Europe.{{sfn|Niewyk|Nicosia|2000|p=47}} The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum calculates at least 220,000.&lt;ref name=RomaUSHMM&gt;{{cite web |title=Genocide of European Roma (Gypsies) |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher= [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005219 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Hancock]], who specializes in Romani history and culture, argues for between 500,000 and 1,500,000.{{sfn|Hancock|2004|pp=383–96}} The Roma refer to the genocide as the ''[[Porajmos|Pořajmos]]''.{{sfn|Huttenbach|2016|p=31}}

The treatment of the Roma was not consistent across German-occupied territories, with those in France and the [[Low Countries]] subject to restrictions on movement and some confinement to collection camps. Those in Central and Eastern Europe were sent to concentration camps and murdered by soldiers and execution squads.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=418–421}} Before being sent to the camps, they were herded into ghettos, including several hundred into the [[Warsaw Ghetto]].&lt;ref name=USHMMDepoWar/&gt; Further east, teams of ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' tracked down Romani encampments and murdered the inhabitants on the spot, leaving no records of the victims. They were also targeted by allies of the Germans, such as the [[Ustaše]] regime in Croatia, where a large number were killed in the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]];{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=418–421}} the total killed in Croatia numbered around 28,000.{{sfn|Bloxham|2009|p=119}} After the Germans occupied Hungary, 1,000 Roma were deported to Auschwitz.{{sfn|Bloxham|2009|p=114}}

In May 1942 the Roma were placed under similar labour and social laws to the Jews. On 16 December 1942 Heinrich Himmler issued a decree that "Gypsy Mischlinge [mixed breeds], Roma Gypsies, and members of the clans of Balkan origins who are not of German blood" should be sent to Auschwitz, unless they had served in the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''. This was adjusted on 15 November 1943, when Himmler ordered that, in the occupied Soviet areas, "sedentary Gypsies and part-Gypsies are to be treated as citizens of the country. Nomadic Gypsies and part-Gypsies are to be placed on the same level as Jews and placed in concentration camps." Bauer argues that this adjustment reflected Nazi ideology that the Roma, originally an Aryan population, had been "spoiled" by non-Romani blood.{{sfn|Bauer|1998|pp=445–446}}

===Slavs===
{{Main|Generalplan Ost|Hunger Plan}}
[[File:Czeslawa Kwoka - Brasse.jpg|thumb|[[Czesława Kwoka]], one of many [[Poles|Polish]] children murdered in Auschwitz by the Nazis]]
The Nazis considered the [[Slav]]s as subhuman, or ''[[Untermenschen]]''.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=174–175}}{{sfn|Snyder|1976|p=359}} In a secret memorandum dated 25 May 1940, Heinrich Himmler stated that it was in German interests to foster divisions between the ethnic groups in the East. He also wanted to restrict non-Germans in the conquered territories to schools that would only teach them how to write their own name, count up to 500, and obey Germans.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=450–452}}{{sfn|Fritz|2011|p=23}} Himmler's ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'' (General Plan East), agreed to by Hitler in the summer of 1942,{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=204-205}} involved exterminating, expelling, or enslaving all or most Slavs from their lands over a period of 20–30 years to make [[Lebensraum|living space]] for Germans.{{sfn|Mazower|2008|pp=208–211}} In 1992 [[Rudolph Rummel]] estimated the number of Slavs murdered by the Germans to be 10,547,000.{{sfn|Rummel|1992|p=18}}

====Ethnic Poles====

[[File:Execution of Poles by German Einsatzkomanndo Oktober1939.jpg|thumb|left|Execution of Poles by ''[[Einsatzkommando]]'', [[Leszno]], October 1939]]
German planners in November 1939 called for "the complete destruction" of all [[Poles]].{{sfn|Gellately|2001|p=153}} Poland under German occupation was to be cleared of Poles and settled by German colonists.{{sfn|Berghahn|1999|pp=32–33}} The Polish political leadership and other leaders were the targets of an organized campaign of murder ([[Intelligenzaktion]] and [[German AB-Aktion in Poland|AB-Aktion]]).{{sfn|Bloxham|2009|p=112}} But German planners decided against a genocide of ethnic Poles on the same scale as against Jews, at least in the short term,{{sfn|Gellately|2001|p=154}} and planned to completely Germanize the Polish territories by removing or allowing to die of mistreatment 80-85% of the Polish population.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=173-174}}

Between 1.8 and 1.9&amp;nbsp;million non-Jewish Polish citizens perished at German hands during the course of the war, about four-fifths of whom were ethnic [[Poles]] with the rest ethnic Ukrainians and Belarusians.&lt;ref name=PolishVictims/&gt; At least 200,000 of these victims died in concentration camps with around 146,000 killed in Auschwitz. Many others died as a result of general massacres or uprisings such as the [[Warsaw Uprising]], where between 120,000 and 200,000 civilians were killed.{{sfn|Piotrowski|1998|p=295}}

During the occupation, the Germans adopted a policy of restricting food rations and medical services as well as the degradation of sanitation and public hygiene.{{sfn|Szafranski|1960|p=43}} The death rate rose from a rate of 13 in 1000 before the war to 18 in 1000 during the war.{{sfn|Szafranski|1960|p=49}} Around 6 million of the victims of World War II were Polish citizens, both Jewish and non-Jewish,{{efn|Half the death toll were Jews.{{sfn|Kochanski|2012|p=532}}}} and over the course of the war Poland lost 20 percent of its pre-war population.{{sfn|Kochanski|2012|p=532}} Over 90 percent of the death toll came through non-military losses, through various deliberate actions by Germany and the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Piotrowski|1998|p=295}} Polish children were also kidnapped by Germans in order to be "Germanized", with perhaps as many as 200,000 children being stolen from their families for this purpose.{{sfn|Lukas|2012|pp=25–27}}

====Soviet citizens and POWs====

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 192-208, KZ Mauthausen, Sowjetische Kriegsgefangene.jpg|thumb|Naked Soviet POWs in the [[Mauthausen concentration camp]], date unknown]]
Soviet civilian populations in the occupied areas were also heavily persecuted outside of events taking place in the frontline warfare of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].{{sfn|Bergen|2016|pp=186–192}} Villages throughout the Soviet Union were destroyed by German troops.{{sfn|Fritz|2011|pp=333–334}} Germans rounded up civilians for forced labour in Germany as well as causing famines by taking foodstuffs.{{sfn|Bergen|2016|pp=214–215}}

In [[Belarus]], Germany imposed a regime that deported some 380,000 people for slave labour and killed hundreds of thousands of civilians. More than 600 villages had their entire populations killed and at least 5,295 Belarusian settlements were destroyed by the Germans. According to Timothy Snyder, of "the nine million people who were on the territory of Soviet Belarus in 1941, some 1.6 million were killed by the Germans in actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians)".{{sfn|Snyder|2010|pp=250–251}} The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has estimated that 3.3 million of the 5.7 million Soviet POWs died in German custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nazi Persecution of Soviet Prisoners of War |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007178 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The death rates decreased as the POWs were needed to work as slaves to help the German war effort; by 1943, half a million of them had been deployed as [[slave labour]].{{sfn|Berenbaum|2006|p=125}}

===Political opponents===
{{Further|German resistance to Nazism}}
German communists, socialists and trade unionists were among the earliest opponents of the Nazis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Non-Jewish Resistance |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007332 |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum | accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were also among the first to be sent to concentration camps.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|p=125}} Before the invasion of the Soviet Union, Hitler issued the [[Commissar Order]], which ordered the execution of all political [[commissar]]s and Communist Party members captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Commissar Order |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007454 |work= Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum | accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Nacht und Nebel]]'' ("Night and Fog") was a directive of Hitler in December 1941, resulting in the kidnapping and [[Forced disappearance|disappearance]] of political activists throughout the German occupied territories.{{sfn|Fischel|2010|p=184}}

===Gay men===
{{further|Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|Institut für Sexualwissenschaft|Pink triangle}}
[[File:Gedenktafel Rosa Winkel Nollendorfplatz.jpg|thumb|upright|Pink-triangle memorial in [[Nollendorfplatz]], Berlin]]
Around 50,000 German gay men were jailed between 1933 and 1945, and 5,000–15,000 are estimated to have been sent to concentration camps. It is not known how many homosexuals died during the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=USHMMgays/&gt;{{sfn|Harran|2000|p=108}} James Steakley writes that what mattered in Germany was criminal intent or character, rather than acts, and the ''"gesundes Volksempfinden"'' ("healthy sensibility of the people") became the guiding legal principle.{{sfn|Steakley|1974}}

In 1936 Himmler created the [[Reich Central Office for the Combating of Homosexuality and Abortion]].{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=237}} The Gestapo raided [[gay bar]]s, tracked individuals using the address books of those they arrested, used the subscription lists of gay magazines to find others, and encouraged people to report suspected homosexual behavior and to scrutinize the behavior of their neighbors.{{sfn|Steakley|1974}} Lesbians were left relatively unaffected;&lt;ref name=USHMMgays&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005261 |title=Persecution of Homosexuals in the Third Reich |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher= United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate= 7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Nazis saw them as "asocials", rather than sexual deviants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005478 |title=Lesbians and the Third Reich |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate= 7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The men convicted between 1933 and 1944 were sent to camps for "rehabilitation", where they were identified by pink triangles.{{sfn|Steakley|1974}} Hundreds were [[castration|castrated]], sometimes "voluntarily" to avoid criminal sentences.{{sfn|Giles|1992|pp=45–7}} Steakley writes that the full extent of gay suffering was slow to emerge after the war. Many victims kept their stories to themselves because homosexuality remained criminalized in postwar Germany.{{sfn|Steakley|1974}}

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
{{further|Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany}}
Because they refused to pledge allegiance to the Nazi party or to serve in the military, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] were sent to concentration camps where they were given the option of renouncing their faith and submitting to the state's authority.{{sfn|Milton|2001|pp=346–349}} They were marked out by purple triangles.

===Persons of color===

The number of Afro-Germans in Germany when the Nazis came to power is variously estimated at 5,000–25,000.{{sfn|Lusane|2003|pp=97–8}} It is not clear whether these figures included Asians. Although blacks, including prisoners of war, in Germany and German-occupied Europe were subjected to incarceration, sterilization, murder, and other abuse, there was no programme to kill them all as there was for the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Blacks during the Holocaust |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005479 |work= Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher= [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] |accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
{{Main|Responsibility for the Holocaust |List of major perpetrators of the Holocaust}}

===Motivation of perpetrators===
[[File:Obersalzberg meeting - May 1939.png|thumb|Holocaust perpetrators [[Heinrich Himmler]], [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and [[Karl Wolff]] at the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]], from silent color film shot by [[Eva Braun]], May 1939]]

In his 1965 essay "Command and Compliance", which originated in his work as an expert witness for the prosecution at the [[Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials]], the German historian Hans Buchheim wrote there was no coercion to murder Jews and others, and all who committed such actions did so out of free will.&lt;ref name=Buchheim1968_3723&gt;{{Harvnb|Buchheim|1968|pp=372–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Buchheim wrote that chances to avoid executing criminal orders "were both more numerous and more real than those concerned are generally prepared to admit",{{r|Buchheim1968_3723}} and that he found no evidence that SS men who refused to carry out criminal orders were sent to concentration camps or executed.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=381}} Moreover, SS rules prohibited acts of gratuitous sadism, as Himmler wished for his men to remain "decent"; acts of sadism were carried out on the initiative of those who were either especially cruel or wished to prove themselves ardent National Socialists.{{r|Buchheim1968_3723}} Finally, he argued that those of a non-criminal bent who committed crimes did so because they wished to conform to the values of the group they had joined and were afraid of being branded "weak" by their colleagues if they refused.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|pp=386–7}}

Similarly, in ''Ordinary Men'' (1992), [[Christopher Browning]] examined the deeds of German [[Reserve Police Battalion 101]] of the ''[[Orpo battalions|Ordnungspolizei]]'' ("order police"), used to commit massacres and round-ups of Jews, as well as mass deportations to the death camps. The members of the battalion were middle-aged men of working-class background from Hamburg, who were too old for regular military duty. They were given no special training. During the murder of 1,500 Jews from [[Józefów, Biłgoraj County|Józefów]], their commander allowed them to opt out of direct participation. Fewer than 12 men out of a battalion of 500 did so. Influenced by the [[Milgram experiment]] on obedience, Browning argued that the men killed out of peer pressure, not bloodlust.{{sfn|Browning|1998|p=57}}

===German public===
In his 1983 book, ''Popular Opinion and Political Dissent in the Third Reich'', [[Ian Kershaw]] examined the ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' (history of everyday life) in Bavaria during the Nazi period. The most common viewpoint of Bavarians was indifference towards what was happening to the Jews, he wrote. Most Bavarians were vaguely aware of the genocide, but they were vastly more concerned about the war. Kershaw argued that "the road to Auschwitz was built by hate, but paved with indifference".{{sfn|Marrus|1987|pp=89–91}}{{sfn|Evans|1989|p=71}}&lt;!--why not cite Kershaw?--&gt;

Kershaw's assessment faced criticism from historians Otto Dov Kulka and Michael Kater. Kater maintained that Kershaw had downplayed the extent of popular antisemitism. Although most of the "spontaneous" antisemitic actions of Nazi Germany had been staged, Kater argued that these had involved substantial numbers of Germans, and therefore it was wrong to view the extreme antisemitism of the Nazis as coming solely from above.{{sfn|Marrus|1987|p=92}} Kulka argued that "passive complicity" would be a better term than "indifference".{{sfn|Marrus|1987|p=93}}&lt;!--why not cite Kulka and Kater?--&gt;

Focusing on the views of Germans opposed to the Nazi regime, the German historian Christof Dipper, in his essay "''Der Deutsche Widerstand und die Juden''" (1983), argued that the majority of the anti-Nazi national-conservatives were antisemitic. No one in the [[German resistance]] supported the Holocaust, but Dipper wrote that the national conservatives did not intend to restore civil rights to the Jews after the planned overthrow of Hitler.{{sfn|Marrus|1987|p=92}}&lt;!--why not cite Dipper?--&gt;

[[File:Defendants in the dock at the Nuremberg Trials.jpg|thumb|right|Defendants in the dock at the Nuremberg trials. The main target of the prosecution was [[Hermann Göring]] (at the left edge on the first row of benches), considered to be the most important surviving official in the ''[[Third Reich]]'' after Hitler's death. Göring later committed suicide.]]
The [[Nuremberg trials]] were a series of [[military tribunal]]s, held by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] after [[World War II]] in [[Nuremberg]], Germany, to prosecute prominent members of the political, military, and economic leadership of [[Nazi Germany]]. The first of these trials was the 1945–1946 trial of the major war criminals before the International Military Tribunal (IMT).{{sfn|Biddiss|2001|p=643}} This tribunal tried 22 political and military leaders of the Third Reich,{{sfn|Snyder|1976|p=255}} except for [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Heinrich Himmler]], and [[Joseph Goebbels]], all of whom had committed suicide several months before.{{sfn|Biddiss|2001|p=643}}

The prosecution entered indictments against 24 major war criminals{{efn|Two of the indictments were dropped before the end of the trial. [[Robert Ley]] committed suicide in prison, and [[Gustav Krupp]] was judged unfit for trial.{{sfn|Biddiss|2001|p=643}} }} and seven organizations—the leadership of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] party, the Reich Cabinet, the [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS), [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SD), the [[Gestapo]], the [[Sturmabteilung]] (SA) and the "General Staff and High Command". The indictments were for: participation in a [[Conspiracy (crime)|common plan or conspiracy]] for the accomplishment of a [[crime against peace]]; planning, initiating and waging [[war of aggression|wars of aggression]] and other crimes against peace; [[war crime]]s; and [[Crimes against humanity#Nuremberg trials|crimes against humanity]]. The tribunal passed judgements ranging from acquittal to death by hanging.{{sfn|Biddiss|2001|pp=643–644}} Eleven defendants were executed, including [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], [[Wilhelm Keitel]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]], and [[Alfred Jodl]]. Ribbentrop, the judgement declared, "played an important part in Hitler's 'final solution of the Jewish question'".{{sfn |Conot|1984|p=495}}

Further trials at Nuremberg took place between 1946 and 1949, which tried a further 185 defendants.{{sfn|Biddiss|2001|p=646}} West Germany initially tried few ex-Nazis, but after the 1958 ''Einsatzgruppen'' trial, the government set up a governmental agency to investigate crimes.{{sfn|Crowe|2008|p=412}} Other trials of Nazis and collaborators took place in Western and Eastern Europe414-428}} In 1960, Israeli [[Mossad]] agents kidnapped Adolf Eichmann in Argentina and brought him to Israel to stand trial for war crimes. The trial ended in his conviction in December 1961, and his execution in May 1962. Eichmann's trial and death revived interest in war criminals and the Holocaust in general.{{sfn|Crowe|2008|pp=430-433}}

===Reparations===
{{Main|Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany}}

In March 1951, the government of [[Israel]] requested $1.5&amp;nbsp; billion from the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] to finance the rehabilitation of 500,000 Jewish survivors, arguing that Germany had stolen $6 billion from the European Jews. Israelis were divided about the idea of taking money from Germany.

===Uniqueness question===
{{further|Historikerstreit|Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism}}
In ''[[Is the Holocaust Unique?]]'' (1995), Shimon Samuels described the acrimonious debate in Holocaust scholarship between "specifists" and "universalists". The former fear debasement of the Holocaust by invidious comparisons. The latter consider it immoral to hold the Holocaust as beyond comparison.{{sfn|Samuels|2009|p=259}} [[Peter Novick]] argued that it is "deeply offensive" to view the Holocaust as unique: What else can all of this possibly mean except 'your catastrophe, unlike ours, is ordinary'&amp;nbsp; ... "{{sfn|Novick|2000|p=9}}

Historian Dan Stone wrote in 2010 that the idea of the Holocaust as unique has been overtaken by attempts to place it in the context of early-20th-century [[Stalinism]], [[ethnic cleansing]], war, and the Nazis' plans for "demographic reordering" after the war.{{sfn|Stone|2010|pp=211–212}} Specifist arguments continue nevertheless to inform the views of many specialists. A 2015 view from a historian of the Third Reich, [[Richard J. Evans]]:

{{quote|Thus although the Nazi 'Final Solution' was one genocide among many, it had features that made it stand out from all the rest as well. Unlike all the others it was bounded neither by space nor by time. It was launched not against a local or regional obstacle, but at a world-enemy seen as operating on a global scale. It was bound to an even larger plan of racial reordering and reconstruction involving further genocidal killing on an almost unimaginable scale, aimed, however, at clearing the way in a particular region – Eastern Europe – for a further struggle against the Jews and those the Nazis regarded as their puppets. It was set in motion by ideologues who saw world history in racial terms. It was, in part, carried out by industrial methods. These things all make it unique. |author=Richard Evans |source=''The Third Reich in History and Memory''{{sfn|Evans|2015|p=385}} }}

'''The Zeitgeist Movement''' is an activist movement established in the United States in 2008 by [[Peter Joseph]]. It advocates a transformation of society and its [[economic system]] to a non-monetary system based on resource allocation and [[environmentalism]].&lt;ref name=huffpost&gt;{{cite news|work=[[HuffPost]]|title=The Zeitgeist Movement: Envisioning A Sustainable Future|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/travis-walter-donovan/the-zeitgeist-movement-en_b_501517.html|author=Travis Donovan|date=May 25, 2011|accessdate=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=contributor blog|certain=y|date=November 2018}}

==Overview==
The Zeitgeist Movement was formed in 2008 by Joseph shortly after the late 2008 release of ''[[Zeitgeist: Addendum]]'', the second film in the [[Zeitgeist (film series)|''Zeitgeist'' film series]].&lt;ref name=o3/&gt;&lt;ref name=v2&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohn|first1=Shane|title=New world re-order|url=http://www.vcreporter.com/cms/story/detail/new_world_re_order/8838/|publisher=VCReporter|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas were based on the [[Jacque Fresco#The Venus Project and later career|Venus Project]], a societal model created by [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineer]] [[Jacque Fresco]]. In the Venus Project, machines control government and industry and safeguard resources using an [[artificial intelligence]] "earthwide autonomic sensor system", a super-brain connected to all human knowledge.&lt;ref name=h6&gt;{{cite web|title=Zeitgeist Media Festival 2012: A celebration to be shared with the entire Earth|url=http://www.hollywoodtoday.net/2012/08/14/zeitgeist-media-festival-2012-a-celebration-to-be-shared-with-the-entire-earth/|accessdate=April 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2018}} 

In its first year, the movement described itself as "the [[activist]] arm of [[Jacque Fresco#The Venus Project and later career|the Venus Project]]."&lt;ref name=huffpost/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=contributor blog|certain=y|date=November 2018}} In April 2011, partnership between the two groups ended in an apparent power struggle, with Joseph commenting, "Without [the Zeitgeist Movement], [the Venus Project] doesn’t exist – it has nothing but ideas and has no viable method to bring it to light."&lt;ref name=o3&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gore, Jeff|url=https://www.orlandoweekly.com/orlando/the-view-from-venus/Content?oid=2248863|title=The view from Venus Jacque Fresco designed a society without politics, poverty and war.

As a result, Fresco withdrew participation in the Zeitgeist Movement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=retxWac-6Z8 Interview of Fresco Retrieved May 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2018}}

The group is critical of market [[capitalism]], describing it as structurally corrupt and wasteful of resources. According to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', the group dismisses historic religious concepts as misleading, and embraces sustainable [[ecology]] and scientific administration of society.&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Danien.

''The New York Times'' reported in 2009 that the organization's second annual event sold out [[Manhattan Community College]] in New York with 900 people who paid $10 apiece to attend.

==Response==
An article in the ''[[Journal of Contemporary Religion]]'' describes the movement as an example of a "conspirituality", a synthesis of [[New Age]] spirituality and [[conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ward, Charlotte|author2=Voas, David|year=2011|title=The Emergence of Conspirituality|journal=Journal of Contemporary Religion|volume=26|issue=1|pages=109-111|doi=10.1080/13537903.2011.539846 |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13537903.2011.539846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michelle Goldberg]] of ''[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet Magazine]]'' called the movement "the world's first Internet-based apocalyptic cult, with members who parrot the party line with cheerful, rote fidelity." In her opinion, the movement is "devoted to a kind of sci-fi planetary communism", and the [[Zeitgeist (film series)#Zeitgeist: The Movie|2007 documentary]] that "sparked" the movement was "steeped in far-right, isolationist, and covertly anti-Semitic conspiracy theories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/57732/brave-new-world|title=Brave New World|author=Goldberg, Michelle|work=[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]|date=February 2, 2011|accessdate=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Feuer of ''The New York Times'' said the movement was like "a utopian presentation of a money-free and computer-driven vision of the future, a wholesale reimagination of civilization, as if Karl Marx and Carl Sagan had hired John Lennon from his "Imagine" days to do no less than redesign the underlying structures of planetary life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=They’ve Seen the Future and Dislike the Present|author=Alan Feuer|date=March 17, 2009&lt;!--"A version of this article appeared in print on March 17, 2009, on page A24 of the New York edition." --&gt;|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/nyregion/17zeitgeist.html|accessdate=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''The woman question'''', which is translated from the French term ''querelle des femmes'' (literally, 'dispute of women') refers both to an intellectual debate from the 1400s to the 1700s on the nature of women and feminist campaigns for social change after the 1700s.

While the French phrase ''querelle des femmes'' deals specifically with the Renaissance period, 'the woman question' in English (or in corresponding languages) is a phrase usually used in connection with a social change in the later half of the 19th century, which questioned the fundamental roles of women in Western industrialized countries such as the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States of America]], [[Canada]], and [[Russia]]. Issues of [[women's suffrage]], [[reproductive rights]], [[Bodily integrity|bodily autonomy]], [[Private property|property rights]], [[Legal rights of women in history|legal rights]], and medical rights, and [[marriage]] dominated cultural discussions in newspapers and intellectual circles. While many women were supportive of these changing roles, they did not agree unanimously. Often issues of marriage and [[sexual freedom]] were most divisive.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Context==
The ''querelle des femmes'' or 'woman question' originally referred to a broad debate from the 1400s to the 1700s in Europe regarding the nature of women, their capabilities, and whether they should be permitted to study, write, or govern in the same manner as men. Both in the scholarly and popular sphere, authors criticized and praised women's natures, arguing for or against their capacity to be educated in the same manner as men. As classical [[Aristotelianism]] held that women are incapable of [[reason]], many argued that women's nature prevented them from higher learning.&lt;ref name=Voices2001&gt;DiCaprio, Lisa, and Wiesner E, Merry. ''Lives and Voices: Sources in European Women's History''. Wadsworth Cengage Learning, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; As the debate developed, some agreed that men were not naturally more intelligent than women - but argued that the female nature also prevented them from taking higher learning seriously.&lt;ref name=Voices2001 /&gt; In addition, there was great controversy over [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] notions of women as inherently defective, in which 'defenders of women' like [[Christine de Pizan]] and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] attempted to refute attacks against women as a whole.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/10723739|title=Women, history &amp; theory : the essays of Joan Kelly|last=1928-1982.|first=Kelly, Joan,|date=1984|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=0226430278|location=Chicago|pages=77|oclc=10723739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this debate was deeply important to some of those who wrote in support of or against women, participation in the ''querelle des femmes'' was also an intellectual exercise for many authors with less personal significance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A resurgence in the debate over the nature and role of women are illustrated by the [[Romantic movement]]'s exploration in fiction and drama (and opera) of the nature of 'man', of human beings as individuals and as members of society. Conflict between women's prescribed roles, their own values, and their perceptions of self are prominent in such works as ''[[Die Walküre]]'', ''[[Effi Briest]]'', ''[[Madame Bovary]]'', ''[[Middlemarch]]'', ''[[Anna Karenina]]'', ''[[A Doll's House]]'', and ''[[Hedda Gabler]]''. Each of these addresses women's emotional, social, economic, and religious lives, highlighting the ways in which 'the woman question' had disrupted notions of a static nature which all women share.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==History==
===First use and traditional debate===
The term was first used in France: the ''querelle des femmes'' (literally, 'dispute of women'). From 1450 into the years that witnessed the beginning of the Reformation, institutions controlled by the Catholic Church, had come into question. Secular states had begun to form in early modern Europe, and the feudal system was overtaken by centralized governments. This disruption extended to the relationships between men and women, and the Renaissance created a contraction of individual freedom for women, unlike men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These changes were justified through a number of arguments which referred to the inherent nature of women as subordinate to men.

On one side of the quarrel, many argued that women were inferior to men because man was created by God first, and were therefore stronger and more important. Also, much of Christianity, throughout the ages, has viewed women as the Daughters of Eve, the original temptress responsible for humanity being expelled from the Garden of Eden.&lt;ref&gt;Frize, Monique. ''Laura Bassi and Science in 18th Century Europe: The Extraordinary Life and Role of Italy's Pioneering Female Professor''. 1st ed. N.p.: Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, n.d. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine in particular understood women as having souls that were 'naturally more seductive', and emphasized their 'powerful inborn potential to corrupt'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/155679141|title=Women's rights and religious practice : claims in conflict|last=L.|first=Boden, Alison|date=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=|isbn=9780230551442|location=Basingstoke|pages=74|oclc=155679141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious justifications were not the only sources of information regarding woman's nature. As [[Renaissance humanism]] developed, there was great interest in returning to classical Greek and Roman philosophy. Classical philosophy held that women were inferior to men at a physical level, and this physical inferiority made them intellectually inferior as well.&lt;ref name=Voices2001 /&gt; While the extent of this inferiority was hotly debated by the likes of [[Christine de Pizan]] and [[Moderata Fonte]], women continued to be understood as inherently subordinate to men, and this was the basis for preventing from women from attending universities or participating in the public sphere.&lt;ref name=Voices2001 /&gt;

The 'defenders of women' on one side of the debate, according to Joan Kelly, "pointed out that the writings of the literate and the learned were distorted by what we now call sexism."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They pointed out that accounts of women's deeds and nature were almost entirely written by men, many of whom had reasons to speak poorly of women. These writers, who were referred to as 'ladies' advocates' by the 17th and 18th centuries, promoted an [[Empiricism|empirical]] approach, which would measure the deeds and capabilities of women without bias. These arguments did not always insist that women were individuals, as modern feminists would argue, but often simply attempted to defend the 'nature' of women from slander.

=== 1400s ===
One of the first women to answer 'the woman question' was [[Christine de Pizan]]. She published ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies]]'' in 1405, in which de Pizan narrated her learning of the value of women and their virtue. She wrote this book in response to a book called ''[[Romance of the Rose]],'' which attacked women and the value of marriage. While de Pizan wrote this book to justify her place in the world of literature and publishing at the time, ''[[The Book of the City of Ladies]]'' can be considered one important source in early [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== 1500s ===
[[Baldassare Castiglione]] contributed to the ''querelle'' in ''[[The Book of the Courtier|The Courtier]]'' in 1527, which voiced some support for the 'gentle' side of the debate, which favored women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1529, [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa|Heinrich Agrippa]] contended that men in society did not oppress women because of some natural law, but because they wanted to keep their social power and status.&lt;ref&gt;The Portable Rabelais, p. 370.  ed. Samuel Putnam, 1964; Gisela Bock and Margarete Zimmermann, "The European ''Querelle des femmes''." In: ''Medieval Forms of Argument: Disputation and Debate''. Hrsg. Georgiana Donavin, Carol Poster, und Richard Utz. Eugene, OR: Wipf &amp; Stock, 2002. S. 127-56.&lt;/ref&gt; Agrippa argued for the nobility of women and thought women were created better than men. He argued that in the first place, women being made better than man, received the better name. Man was called Adam, which means Earth; woman Eva, which is by interpretation Life.&lt;ref&gt;"The Philosophy of Natural Magic: End Matter by Morley:The Nobility of Woman." ''The Philosophy of Natural Magic: End Matter byMorley: The Nobility of Woman''. N.p., n.d. Web. 02 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Man was created from the dust of the earth, while woman was made from something far purer. Agrippa's metaphysical argument was that creation itself is a circle that began when God created light and ended when he created woman. Therefore, women and light occupy adjacent points on the circle of creation and must have similar properties of purity.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== 1600s to 1700s ===
[[Moderata Fonte]] wrote ''The Worth Of Women'' in 1600, which collected poetry and dialogues which proclaimed the value of women, arguing that their intelligence and capability to rule cannot be recognized if they are not educated.&lt;ref name="Voices2001" /&gt; The tradition of defending women from specific attacks continued into the 1600s and 1700s:&lt;blockquote&gt;Another poet, Sarah Fyge Field Egerton, appears to have written ''The Female Advocate'' (1686) - at age 14! - in reply to the "late satire on women" quoted for its obscenity; [[Judith Drake]] penned ''An Essay in Defence of the Female Sex'' (1696); and women of low and high station continued the polemic in the eighteenth century. - Joan Kelly, "Early Feminist Theory and the ''Querelle des Femmes.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Victorian Era===
The term ''querelle des femmes'' was used in [[England]] in the [[Victorian era]], stimulated, for example, by the [[Reform Act 1832]] and the [[Reform Act 1867]]. The [[Industrial Revolution]] brought hundreds of thousands of lower-class women into factory jobs, presenting a challenge to traditional ideas of a woman's place.&lt;ref name="wwnorton"&gt;Hudson, Dale; Adams, Maeve (2010). The Women Question. W.W. Norton and Company. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.wwnorton.com/nael/victorian/topic_2/welcome.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109120115/http://www.wwnorton.com/nael/victorian/topic_2/welcome.htm |archivedate=2006-11-09 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A prime issue of contention was whether what was referred to as women's "private virtue" could be transported into the public arena; opponents of [[women's suffrage]] claimed that bringing women into public would dethrone them, and sully their feminine virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Areas of discussion==
The woman question was raised in many different social areas. For example, in the second half of the 19th century, in the context of [[religion]], extensive discussion within the [[United States]] took place on the participation of women in church. In the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], the woman question was the most pressing issue in the 1896 conference.&lt;ref&gt;Through the ''North American Review'', writers Sarah Grand and Ouida argued over the role of women in western society. {{Cite news

The '''United States federal civil service''' is the [[civilian]] workforce (i.e., non-elected and non-military, [[public sector]] employees) of the [[United States federal government]]'s departments and agencies. The federal civil service was established in 1871 ({{UnitedStatesCode|5|2101}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov/hrm/pmanager/st6.html |title=The Federal Civil Service |publisher=DOI University, National Business Center, U.S. Department of the Interior (Revised 11/10/98) |accessdate=2009-08-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018051808/http://www.doi.gov/hrm/pmanager/st6.html |archivedate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. state and local government entities often have comparable civil service systems that are modeled on the national system, in varying degrees.

According to the [[Office of Personnel Management]], {{as of|December 2011|lc=y}}, there were approximately 2.79 million civil servants employed by the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://templatelab.com/total-government-employment-since-1962/ |title=Total Government Employment Since 1962 |publisher=Opm.gov |accessdate=2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Keefe |first=Ed |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/federal-eye/2010/09/how_many_federal_workers_are_t.html |title=Federal Eye – How many federal workers are there? |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |accessdate=2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/federal-employment-reports/employment-trends-data/2011/december/ |title=December 2011 |publisher=Opm.gov |date=2012-01-01 |accessdate=2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes employees in the departments and agencies run by any of the [[Branches of the United States government|three branches of government]] (the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive branch]], [[U.S. Congress|legislative branch]], and [[U.S. federal court|judicial branch]]), such as over 600,000 employees in the [[United States Postal Service#Employment in the USPS|U.S. Postal Service]].

==Career employees and political appointees==
The majority of civil service positions are classified as [[competitive service]], meaning employees are selected based on merit after a competitive hiring process for positions that are open to all applicants. The [[Senior Executive Service]] (SES) is the classification for non-competitive, senior leadership positions filled by career employees or [[Political appointments in the United States|political appointments]] (e.g., [[U.S. Cabinet|Cabinet members]], [[U.S. ambassador|ambassadors]], etc.). [[Excepted service]] positions (also known as unclassified service) are non-competitive jobs in certain federal agencies with security and intelligence functions (e.g., the {{abbrlink|CIA|Central Intelligence Agency}}, {{abbrlink|FBI|Federal Bureau of Investigations}}, [[U.S. State Department|State Department]], etc.) that are authorized to create their own hiring policies and are not subject to most appointment, pay, and classification laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Help Center: Entering Federal Service|url=https://www.usajobs.gov/Help/working-in-government/service/|website=USAJOBS|publisher=United States Office of Personnel Management|accessdate=January 25, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|U.S. Civil Service Reform}}
In the early 19th century, positions in the federal government were held at the pleasure of the president—a person could be fired at any time. The [[spoils system]] meant that jobs were used to support the American political parties, though this was gradually changed by the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] of 1883 and subsequent laws. By 1909, almost two-thirds of the U.S. federal workforce was appointed based on merit, that is, qualifications measured by tests. Certain senior civil service positions, including some heads of diplomatic missions and executive agencies, are filled by political appointees. Under the [[Hatch Act of 1939]], civil servants are not allowed to engage in political activities while performing their duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osc.gov/hatchact.htm |title=Political Activity (Hatch Act) |publisher=Osc.gov |accessdate=2011-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520001454/http://www.osc.gov/hatchact.htm |archivedate=2011-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, an outgoing administration will give its political appointees positions with civil service protection in order to prevent them from being fired by the new administration; this is called "burrowing" in civil service jargon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Administration Moves to Protect Key Appointees|date=November 18, 2008|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/17/AR2008111703537_pf.html|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|first=Juliet|last=Eilperin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal agencies==
{{main|List of United States federal agencies}}
Employees in the civil services work under one of the [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agencies]] or one of the 15 [[United States federal executive departments|executive departments]].

In addition to departments, there are a number of staff organizations grouped into the [[Executive Office of the President]]. These include the [[White House]] staff, the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], the [[Office of Management and Budget]], the [[Council of Economic Advisers]], the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative|Office of the U.S. Trade Representative]], the [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]] and the [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]].

There are also [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agencies]] such as the [[United States Postal Service]], the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), and the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID). In addition, there are [[government-owned corporation]]s such as the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) and the [[National Railroad Passenger Corporation]].&lt;ref name="Office of Management &amp; Budget Circular A=1, with section 300 details"&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Circular NO.

There were 456 federal agencies in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.centerforsmallgovernment.com/small-government-news/agencies-of-the-federal-government |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014192811/http://www.centerforsmallgovernment.com/small-government-news/agencies-of-the-federal-government/ |archive-date=2013-10-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pay systems==
{{main|General Schedule|Federal Wage System|Senior Executive Service}}

The pay system of the United States government civil service has evolved into a complex set of pay systems that include principally the General Schedule (GS) for white-collar employees, Federal Wage System (FWS) for blue-collar employees, Senior Executive System (SES) for Executive-level employees, Foreign Service Schedule (FS) for members of the Foreign Service and more than twelve alternate pay systems that are referred to as alternate or experimental pay systems such as the first experimental system China Lake Demonstration Project. The current system began as the Classification Act of 1923&lt;ref&gt;Pub. Law no. 516, Ch. 265, 42 Stat. 1488 (March 4, 1923).&lt;/ref&gt; and was refined into law with the Classification Act of 1949. These acts that provide the foundation of the current system have been amended through executive orders and through published amendments in the Federal Register that sets for approved changes in the regulatory structure of the federal pay system. The common goal among all pay systems is to achieve the goal of paying equitable salaries to all involved workers regardless of system, group or classification. This is referred to as pay equity or ("equal pay for equal work"). Select careers in high demand may be subject to a special rate table,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.opm.gov/SpecialRates/index.aspx|title=U.S. Office of Personnel Management|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can pay above the standard GS tables. These careers include certain engineering disciplines and patent examiners.&lt;ref&gt;http://nasajobs.nasa.gov/benefits/pay.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gogovernment.org/government_101/pay_and_the_general_schedule.php|title=Federal pay and the General Schedule (GS)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Schedule (GS) includes white collar workers at levels 1 through 15, most professional, technical, administrative, and clerical positions in the federal civil service. The Federal Wage System or Wage Grade (WG) schedule includes most federal [[blue-collar]] workers. {{As of|2004|9}}, 71% of federal civilian employees were paid under the GS; the remaining 29% were paid under other systems such as the [[Federal Wage System]] for federal blue-collar civilian employees, the [[Senior Executive Service]]/[[Senior Level]] and the [[Executive Schedule]] for high-ranking [[federal employee]]s, and the pay schedules for the [[United States Postal Service]] and the [[United States Foreign Service|Foreign Service]]. In addition, some federal agencies—such as the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]], the [[Federal Reserve System]], and the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]—have their own unique pay schedules.

All federal employees in the GS system receive a base pay that is adjusted for locality. Locality pay varies, but is at least 10% of base salary in all parts of the United States. The following salary ranges represent the lowest and highest possible amounts a person can earn in base salary, without earning over-time pay or receiving a merit-based bonus. Actual salary ranges differ adjusted for increased locality pay (for instance a GS-9, step 1 in rural [[Arkansas]] may start at $50,598&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/salary-tables/pdf/2018/RUS.pdf|title=OPM SALARY TABLE FOR THE REST OF U.S.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120124458/https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/salary-tables/pdf/2018/RUS.pdf|archive-date=2018-01-20|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; versus $61,084&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/salary-tables/pdf/2018/SF.pdf|title=OPM SALARY TABLE FOR THE LOCALITY PAY AREA OF SAN JOSE|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120124558/https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/salary-tables/pdf/2018/SF.pdf|archive-date=2018-01-20|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[San Jose, California]]), but all base salaries lie within the parameters of the following ranges (effective January, 2018):&lt;ref name="Office of Personnel Management, Salary Tables, 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/salary-tables/pdf/2018/GS.pdf|title=Office of Personnel Management, Salary Tables, 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120124341/https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/salary-tables/pdf/2018/GS.pdf|archive-date=2018-01-20|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteen percent of federal employees earned salaries of $100,000 or more in 2009.

==Employment by agency==
{{As of|2009|01}}, the Federal Government, excluding the Postal Service and soldiers, employed about 2 million civilian workers.{{outdated|date=January 2018}} The Federal Government is the nation's single largest employer.  Although most federal agencies are based in the [[Washington, D.C.]] region, only about 16% (or about 288,000) of the federal government workforce is employed in this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Federal Government, Excluding the Postal Service |publisher=US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics |date=2008-03-12 |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs041.htm |accessdate=2008-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114201419/http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs041.htm |archivedate=2009-01-14 |df= }}, Section: Employment.

The commission was created to administer the [[civil service]] of the [[United States federal government]]. The law required federal government employees to be selected through competitive exams and basis of merit;&lt;ref name=opj /&gt; it also prevented elected officials and political appointees from firing civil servants, removing civil servants from the influences of political patronage and partisan behavior.&lt;ref name=opj /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Creating America: A History of the United States'', Rand McNally, p. 238 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the law did not apply to state and municipal governments.

Effective January 1, 1978, the commission was renamed the [[Office of Personnel Management]] under the provisions of [[Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978]] ''(43 F.R. 36037, 92 Stat. 3783)'' and the [[Civil Service Reform Act of 1978]].

The United States Civil service exams have since been abolished for many positions, since statistics show that they do not accurately allow hiring of minorities according to the [[affirmative action]] guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;E.

This act abolished the United States Civil Service Commission and created the U.S. [[Office of Personnel Management]] (OPM), the [[Federal Labor Relations Authority]] (FLRA) and the [[U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board]] (MSPB). OPM primarily provides management guidance to the various agencies of the executive branch and issues regulations that control federal human resources. FLRA oversees the rights of federal employees to form collective bargaining units (unions) and to engage in collective bargaining with agencies. MSPB conducts studies of the federal civil service and mainly hears the appeals of federal employees who are disciplined or otherwise separated from their positions. This act was an effort to replace incompetent officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingraham|first=Patricia W.|author2=Donald P.

==Reforms under the Trump administration==
President [[Donald Trump]] signed three [[executive order]]s designed to enforce merit-system principles in the civil service and intended to improve efficiency, transparency, and accountability in the federal government. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Eaton |first1=Sabrina |title=President Trump signs three executive orders in attempted crackdown on federal unions |url=https://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2018/05/president_trump_attempts_crack.html |accessdate=3 December 2018 |work=The Plain Dealer |publisher=Cleveland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Korte |first1=Gregory |title=Trump signs executive orders aimed at loosening clout of federal labor unions |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/05/25/trump-executive-orders-would-attempt-limit-union-power/645951002/ |accessdate=3 December 2018 |work=USA TODAY |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ketanji Brown Jackson |U.S. District Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson ]] struck down the majority of Trump's executive orders, ruling they were a violation of federal law. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Korte |first1=Gregory |title=Judge rules against Trump's attempt to weaken federal unions |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/08/25/donald-trump-labor-unions-court-strikes-down-three-executive-orders/1098451002/ |website=USA TODAY |accessdate=3 December 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''We Demand a Referendum Now''' ('''WDARN''') was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[political party]] launched by independent [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) [[Nikki Sinclaire]] in June 2012 following her departure from the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP).&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;{{cite web | author = Richards, S. | url = http://richardsblog.dailymail.co.uk/2012/09/is-it-time-for-ukip-to-make-way-for-a-new-eurosceptic-party.html | title = Is it time for UKIP to make way for a new Eurosceptic party? | publisher = [[Daily Mail]] | date = September 20, 2012 | accessdate = September 24, 2012 | quote = You can tell when it's UKIP Conference time, because Nikki Sinclaire, the former UKIP MEP, can always be relied upon to pull a stunt to try to steal the limelight from her old party. This time, she's set up her own party, the "We Demand A Referendum Now Party".}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[single-issue party]] that sought to force a [[referendum]] on British membership of the [[European Union]] (EU).

We Demand a Referendum Now was registered with the Electoral Commission in June 2012 by [[Nikki Sinclaire]]. The party held its inaugural conference on 5 October 2012.&lt;ref name="Staffs"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Nikki-Sinclaire-s-Demand-Referendum-party-holds/story-17045711-detail/story.html| title = Nikki Sinclaire's We Demand a Referendum party holds first conference | publisher = This is Staffordshire | date = October 6, 2012 | accessdate = October 9, 2012}}{{dead link|date=March 2017|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party ran a slate of candidates in the [[West Midlands (European Parliament constituency)|West Midlands European Parliament constituency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/news/election2014/11172543.Revealed__all_the_West_Midlands_region_candidates_set_to_contest_seats_in_European_Parliament/?ref=arc|title=Revealed, all the West Midlands region candidates set to contest seats in European Parliament|author=|date=|website=Worcester News}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 European Parliament elections]].

We Demand a Referendum aimed to "go beyond party politics" and "do everything within [its] power to enable a referendum".&lt;ref name="PSE"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.publicserviceeurope.com/article/2470/new-anti-eu-political-party-launches-in-uk | title = New anti-EU political party launches in UK | author = Sinclaire, N. | publisher = Public Service Europe | date = September 18, 2012 | accessdate = September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its leadership accused the EU of being [[protectionism|protectionist]] and called for the creation of a [[Royal Commission]] to look into the costs and benefits of EU membership for the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Lin"&gt;''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnHutCiwT4Q Nikki Sinclaire discusses We Demand A Referendum on BBC Radio Lincolnshire]'' {{via|YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
