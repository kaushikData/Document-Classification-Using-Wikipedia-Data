'''100th Anniversary (Gümüşkum) Nature Park''' ({{lang-tr|100. Yıl (Gümüşkum) Tabiat Parkı}}) is a coastal [[nature park]] in [[Mersin]], Turkey.

The park at {{coords|36|43|15|N|34|29|43|E|}} is in [[Davultepe]] town, which merged to  Mersin urban fabric. It is located on the [[Mediterranean Sea]] coast covering an area of {{convert|22.98|ha}}.  It is on the Mersin-[[Silifke]] highway {{TUR-D|400}} {{convert|12|km|abbr=on}} southwest of Mersin. In 1977, the grove at the Mediterranean Sea side was declared a recreation area. On November 7, 2011, the area was declared a nature park by the [[Ministry of Environment and Forest (Turkey)|Ministry of Environment and Forest]].&lt;ref name="b7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="st"/&gt; However the ministry decided to end its status as a nature park and there is a heated discussion on its future status &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inovatifhaber.com/haber/davultepe-100yil-gumuskum-sahilinin-tabiat-parki-statusunden-cikartilmasina-tepkiler-suruyor-11977.html Inonativ Haber Online news {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has a {{convert|1.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} long sandy beach.&lt;ref name="st"/&gt; "Gümüşkum" means literally "Silver sand". The nature park offers outdoor recreational activities for visitors on daily basis such as [[hiking]], [[Human swimming|swimming]] and [[picnic]]ing. [[Camping]] and renting of [[cottage]]s or [[bungalow]]s are also available.&lt;ref name="b7"/&gt;

The trees in the park are Turkish pine (''[[Pinus brutia]]'') and [[eucalyptus]]. The [[endemic]] plant sea daffodil (''[[Pancratium maritimum]]'') is endangered.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt; A section of the sandy beach in the nature park is used by [[green sea turtle]]s (''Chelonia mydas'') and [[loggerhead sea turtle]]s (''Caretta caretta'') for [[ovulation]].&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="st"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ut"/&gt; A treatment and rehabilitation center for the sea turtles is situated inside the nature park.&lt;ref name="b7"/&gt;

The status of the protected area as "nature park" was revoked on July 14, 2015.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt; It was decided to decrease its status to "recreation area of grade A". Upon protests of the residents of Mezitli and Mersin to protect and conserve the sea turtles, the Ministry cancelled its decision within about one month, and the status of the protected area remained unchanged.&lt;ref name="c1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;

'''''A Girl Named Disaster''''' is a 1996 novel by [[Nancy Farmer]].  In 1997, Farmer won the [[Newbery Honor]] for the novel, which was also a finalist for the [[National Book Award for Young People's Literature]].  The book explores the qualities needed to survive in a hostile environment (particularly by a woman), coming-of-age and the availability of spiritual guidance.

==Plot==
Nhamo is an 11-year-old girl living in a traditional Shona village located in [[Mozambique]] around 1981. She was raised with the knowledge and customs of her tribe. Nhamo means "disaster" in the Shona language. Nhamo was given this name because of the scandal and wrongful things continued to follow her and her mother. After experiencing trouble with a cholera epidemic, a leopard, and a prescribed marriage proposed by a false witch doctor, she flees with her dying grandmother's blessings, some gold nuggets, and her meager survival skills. Nhamo steals a boat and supplies under her grandmother's instructions and uses the river as her road to Zimbabwe, where she faces the threat of hippos, crocodiles, and other animals trying to kill her, while dealing with the pressures of becoming a woman.

What should have been a two-day boat trip across the border to her father's family in [[Zimbabwe]] spans a year in which Nhamo faces starvation and the threat of hungry or aggressive animals. The girl finds her way to a lush, haunted island and lives alongside a troop of baboons.  Daily conversations with spirits combat Nhamo's loneliness and provide her with sage and practical advice. She makes mistakes, loses heart, and nearly dies of starvation. Even after she arrives in Zimbabwe where she lives with scientists before meeting her father's family, Nhamo must learn how to live in a modern society (clothing, behavior, literacy), and is urged to let go of the "evil" spirits that "possess" her as prescribed by a Muvuki or witch finder.

==Characters==
*'''Nhamo Jongwe''': The girl named "Disaster". She got her name due to the many disasters she faces during her life, even as a child. However, Nhamo is resourceful and clever, in spite of the bad luck she supposedly causes.
*'''Aunt Chipo''': Nhamo's bad tempered aunt, who has resented Runako, Nhamo's deceased mother and Chipo's older sister, since they were children. She has hated Nhamo and her mother ever since she was born and forces her to do most of the work in the village, allowing her daughter, Masvita, to do the less strenuous tasks.
*'''Masvita''': Nhamo's sweet tempered cousin, who behaves respectfully towards Nhamo, in spite of how mean-spirited her mother is.
*'''Aunt Shuvai''': Nhamo's younger aunt.  She is considerably more ambivalent to Nhamo.
*'''Uncle Kufa''': Nhamo's uncle and Aunt Chipo's husband.  He is a pragmatic man.
*'''Ruva''': Aunt Chipo′s second daughter.
*'''Ambuya''': Nhamo and Masvita's grandmother. She treats Nhamo with respect and loves her dearly, and is one of the few people to do so.  Chipo resents her mother, believing that Ambuya favoured Runako (Nhamo's mother) for doing well in school and Shuvai, who was the youngest of Ambuya's three daughters.
*'''Crocodile Guts''': A fisherman
*'''Sister Gladys''': A nurse who takes care of Nhamo in the later part of the book.
* '''Goré Mtoko ''': Killed by Nhamo's father
* '''Muvuki''' : the witch finder

}}'''''A Week in the Woods''''' is a [[children's book]] by [[Andrew Clements]].  Part of his School series, it was released by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 2002.

==Plot==
Mr. Maxwell, a fifth grade science teacher, is in charge of the school‟s "Week in the Woods" program. He is an Eagle Scout and an avid outdoorsman. He has organized and carried out this program for sixteen years. He is totally organized and prepared, months in advance, for the upcoming week in the woods, but there is something that he doesn't know, something that he cannot prepare for, which is trouble.

Mark Chelmsley IV, a rich child living in [[New York City|New York]], is unhappy about moving to a small town in New Hampshire. His parents work constantly and are extremely wealthy, but often spend very little with him.  Mark is closer to Anya and Leon, a Russian couple employed as his family's maid and butler.  Mark is assigned to Mr. Maxwell's class, where his know-it-all attitude, wealthy background, and lack of effort quickly turn Mr. Maxwell against him.

At school, Mark chooses not to make friends, not to complete his work, not to even become involved, deciding that his time at school will be temporary and that he has nothing to gain.  However, he gradually starts to become friends with other students in his class and develops a genuine interest in attending the "Week in the Woods", despite rudely rejecting Mr. Maxwell's initial offer.  Mr. Maxwell reluctantly allows him to attend and Mark enjoys spending time in the woods with his new friends.

As Mr. Maxwell and Mark's impressions of one another begin to improve, it is quickly derailed when a knife belonging to Mark's friend is found in their tent.  Mark decides to take the blame, believing that Mr. Maxwell is looking for an excuse to send him away.  When Mark's prediction proves to be true and he is told to go home early, Mark tries to prove that he can survive in the woods on his own.  Mr. Maxwell soon realizes that he has been treating Mark unfairly when he discovers Mark did not bring the knife and is distressed to learn that Mark has disappeared into the woods.  Though Mr. Maxwell finds Mark, he is injured and needs to rely on Mark for them to return safely to the campgrounds.  They come to an understanding with one another during their return and promise to be more open to one another in the future.

==Awards==
The book was critically acclaimed, and nominated for a number of awards, including [[California Young Reader Medal]], [[Golden Sower Masterlist]] (NE), [[Kentucky Bluegrass Award]], and the [[Land of Enchantment Children's Master List]] (NM).  The book won the [[Iowa Children's Choice Awards]] (2004–2005).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iasl-ia.org/icca.php Iowa Children's Choice Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206190038/http://www.iasl-ia.org/icca.php |date=February 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Keystone to Reading Book Award]] of [[Pennsylvania]] (2005).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ksra.org/Resources/previous_award_winners1.htm Keystone to Reading Book Award Award Winners]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17863">High-precision experiments could reveal
small previously unseen differences between the behavior
of matter and antimatter.
This prospect is appealing to physicists because it may
show that nature is not Lorentz symmetric.

== Introduction ==
Ordinary matter is made up of protons, electrons, and neutrons.
The quantum behavior of these particles can be predicted with excellent accuracy
using the [[Dirac equation]], named after [[P.A.M. Dirac]].
One of the triumphs of the Dirac equation is
its prediction of the existence of antimatter particles.
[[Antiprotons]], [[positrons]], and [[antineutron]]s
are now well understood,
and can be created and studied in experiments.

High-precision experiments have been unable to
detect any difference between the masses
of particles and
those of the corresponding [[antiparticles]].
They also have been unable to detect any difference between the magnitudes of
the charges,
or between the lifetimes,
of particles and antiparticles.
These mass, charge, and lifetime symmetries
are required in a Lorentz and CPT symmetric universe,
but are only a small number of the properties that need to match
if the universe is Lorentz and CPT symmetric.

The [[Standard-Model Extension]] ([[Standard-Model Extension|SME]]),
a comprehensive theoretical framework for Lorentz and CPT violation,
makes specific predictions
about how particles and antiparticles
would behave differently in a universe
that is very close to,
but not exactly,
Lorentz symmetric.&lt;ref name="1.SME1"&gt;

In loose terms,
the [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]] can be visualized
as being constructed from
fixed background fields
that interact weakly, but differently,
with particles and antiparticles.

The behavioral differences between
matter and antimatter
are specific to each individual experiment.
Factors that determine the behavior include
the particle species involved,
the electromagnetic, gravitational, and nuclear fields controlling the system.
Furthermore,
for any Earth-bound experiment,
the rotational and orbital motion of the Earth is important,
leading to sidereal and seasonal signals.
For experiments conducted in space, the orbital motion of the craft
is an important factor in determining the signals
of [[Standard-Model Extension|Lorentz violation]] that might arise.
To harness the predictive power of the [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]] in any specific system,
a calculation has to be performed
so that all these factors can be accounted for.
These calculations are facilitated by the reasonable assumption that Lorentz
violations, if they exist,
are small. This makes it possible to use perturbation theory to obtain results
that would otherwise be extremely difficult to find.

The [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]] generates a modified [[Dirac equation]]
that breaks Lorentz symmetry
for some types of particle motions, but not others.
It therefore holds important information
about how [[Standard-Model Extension|Lorentz violations]] might have been hidden
in past experiments,
or might be revealed in future ones.

== Lorentz violation tests with Penning Traps ==
A Penning trap
is a research apparatus
capable of trapping individual charged particles
and their antimatter counterparts.
The trapping mechanism is
a strong magnetic field that keeps the particles near a central axis,
and an electric field that turns the particles around
when they stray too far along the axis.
The motional frequencies of the trapped particle
can be monitored and measured with astonishing precision.
One of these frequencies is the anomaly frequency,
which has played an important role in the measurement
of the [[gyromagnetic ratio]] of the electron (see {{section link|gyromagnetic ratio|gyromagnetic ratio for an isolated electron}}).

The first calculations of [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]] effects
in [[Penning trap]]s
were published in 1997
and 1998.&lt;ref name="ptrap98"&gt;

They showed that,
in identical Penning traps,
if the
anomaly frequency of an [[electron]] was increased,
then the anomaly frequency of a [[positron]]
would be decreased.
The size of the increase or decrease
in the frequency
would be a measure of
the strength of one of the [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]] background fields.
More specifically,
it is a measure
of the component of the background field
along the direction of the axial magnetic field.

In tests of Lorentz symmetry,
the noninertial nature of the laboratory
due to the rotational and orbital motion of the Earth
has to be taken into account.
Each Penning-trap measurement
is the projection of the background [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]] fields
along the axis of the experimental magnetic field
at the time of the experiment.
This is further complicated if the experiment takes
hours, days, or longer to perform.

One approach is to seek instantaneous differences,
by comparing anomaly frequencies
for a particle and an antiparticle
measured at the same time on different days.
Another approach is to seek
sidereal variations,
by continuously monitoring
the anomaly frequency for just one species of particle
over an extended time.
Each offers different challenges.
For example,
instantaneous comparisons
require the electric field in the trap to be
precisely reversed,
while sidereal tests are limited
by the stability of the magnetic field.

An experiment conducted by the physicist Gerald Gabrielse of Harvard University involved two particles confined in a [[Penning trap]]. The idea was to compare a proton and an antiproton, but to overcome the technicalities of having opposite charges,
a negatively charged hydrogen ion was used in place of the proton. The ion, two electrons bound electrostatically with a [[proton]], and the antiproton have the same charge and can therefore be simultaneously trapped. This design allows for quick interchange of the proton and the antiproton and so an instantaneous-type Lorentz test can be performed. The cyclotron frequencies of the two trapped particles
were about 90&amp;nbsp;MHz, and the apparatus was capable of resolving differences
in these of about 1.0&amp;nbsp;Hz. The absence of Lorentz violating effects of this type
placed a limit on combinations of [[Standard-Model Extension#Building the SME|&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;-type SME coefficients]] that had not been accessed in other experiments. The results&lt;ref name="gabrielse99"&gt;
{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Gabrielse |first2=A. |last2=Khabbaz |first3=D.S. |last3=Hall |first4=C. |last4=Heimann |first5=H. |last5=Kalinowsky |first6=W. |last6=Jhe

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
appeared in Physical Review Letters in 1999.

The Penning-trap group at the [[University of Washington]], headed by the Nobel Laureate [[Hans Dehmelt]], conducted a search for sidereal variations in the anomaly frequency of a trapped electron. The results were extracted from an experiment that ran for several weeks, and the analysis required splitting the data into "bins" according to the orientation of the apparatus in the inertial reference frame of the Sun. At a resolution of 0.20&amp;nbsp;Hz, they were unable to discern any sidereal variations in the anomaly frequency, which runs around 185,000,000&amp;nbsp;Hz. Translating this into an upper bound on the relevant
[[Standard-Model Extension|SME]] background field, places a bound of about
10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt; [[GeV]] on a [[Standard-Model Extension#Building the SME|&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;-type electron coefficient]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
was published in Physical Review Letters in 1999.

Another experimental result from the Dehmelt group involved a comparison of the instantaneous type. Using data from a single trapped electron
and a single trapped positron, they again found no difference
between the two anomaly frequencies at a resolution of about 0.2&amp;nbsp;Hz.
This result placed a bound on a simpler combination of
[[Standard-Model Extension#Building the SME|&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;-type coefficients]] at a level of about 10&lt;sup&gt;−24&lt;/sup&gt; GeV.
In addition to being a limit on [[Standard-Model Extension|Lorentz violation]],
this also limits the CPT violation.

== Lorentz violation in antihydrogen ==
The antihydrogen atom is
the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom.
It has a negatively charged antiproton
at the nucleus
that attracts a positively charged positron
orbiting around it.

The spectral lines of hydrogen have frequencies
determined by the energy differences
between the quantum-mechanical orbital states
of the electron.
These lines
have been studied in thousands of spectroscopic experiments
and are understood in great detail.
The quantum mechanics of the positron orbiting an antiproton
in the antihydrogen atom is expected to be very similar
to that of the hydrogen atom.
In fact,
conventional physics predicts that the spectrum of antihydrogen
is identical to that of regular hydrogen.

In the presence of the background fields of the [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]],
the spectra of hydrogen and antihydrogen
are expected to show tiny differences
in some lines,
and no differences in others.
Calculations of these [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]] effects
in antihydrogen and hydrogen
were published&lt;ref name="hbar99"&gt;
{{cite journal
 |first=R. |last=Bluhm |first2=V.A. |last2=Kostelecky |first3=N. |last3=Russell

in Physical Review Letters
in 1999.
One of the main results found
is that hyperfine transitions
are sensitive to Lorentz breaking effects.

Several experimental groups at [[CERN]]
are working on producing antihydrogen.
They are:

* [[AEGIS (particle physics)#AEGIS|AEGIS]]
* [[Antiproton Decelerator#ALPHA|ALPHA]]
* [[ASACUSA]]
* [[ATRAP]]

Creating trapped antihydrogen
in sufficient quantities
to do spectroscopy
is an enormous experimental challenge.
Signatures of [[Standard-Model Extension|Lorentz violation]]
are similar to those expected in Penning traps.
There would be sidereal effects
causing variations in the spectral frequencies
as the experimental laboratory turns with the Earth.
There would also be the possibility of finding instantaneous
Lorentz breaking signals
when antihydrogen spectra are compared directly with conventional hydrogen spectra

In October 2017, the [[BASE experiment]] at [[CERN]] reported a measurement of the [[antiproton]] [[magnetic moment]] to a precision of 1.5 parts per billion.&lt;ref name="TT-20171025"&gt;{{cite web |last=Adamson |first=Allan |title=Universe Should Not Actually Exist: Big Bang Produced Equal Amounts Of Matter And Antimatter |url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/214821/20171025/universe-should-not-actually-exist-big-bang-produced-equal-amounts-of-matter-and-antimatter.htm |date=19 October 2017 |work=TechTimes.com |accessdate=26 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20171020"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Smorra C. et al. |title=A parts-per-billion measurement of the antiproton magnetic moment |url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v550/n7676/full/nature24048.html |date=20 October 2017 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=550 |pages=371–374 |doi=10.1038/nature24048 |accessdate=26 October 2017 |bibcode=2017Natur.550..371S }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is consistent with the most precise measurement of the [[proton]] magnetic moment (also made by BASE in 2014), which supports the hypothesis of [[CPT symmetry]]. It should be noted that this measurement represents the first time that a property of antimatter is known more precisely than the equivalent property in matter.

== Lorentz violation with muons ==
The [[muon]] and its positively charged antiparticle
have been used to perform tests of Lorentz symmetry.
Since the lifetime of the [[muon]] is only a few microseconds,
the experiments are quite different
from ones with electrons and positrons.
Calculations for [[muon]] experiments
aimed at probing [[Standard-Model Extension|Lorentz violation]]
in the [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]]
were first published in the year 2000.&lt;ref name="bkl00"&gt;
{{cite journal
 |first=R. |last=Bluhm |first2=V.A. |last2=Kostelecky |first3=C. |last3=Lane
 |title=CPT and Lorentz Tests with Muons
 |date=2000
 |arxiv=hep-ph/9912451|bibcode = 2000PhRvL..84.1098B |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.1098 |volume=84 |journal=Physical Review Letters |pages=1098–1101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 2001,
Hughes and collaborators published their results
from a search for sidereal signals in the spectrum
of muonium,
an ''atom'' consisting of an electron bound to a negatively charged muon.
Their data,
taken over a two-year period,
showed no evidence for [[Standard-Model Extension|Lorentz violation]].
This placed a stringent constraint on
a combination of [[Standard-Model Extension#Building the SME|&lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;-type coefficients]] in the [[Standard-Model Extension|SME]],
published in Physical Review Letters.&lt;ref name="hughes01"&gt;

 |title=Test of CPT and Lorentz Invariance from Muonium Spectroscopy, Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 111804 (2001)
 |date=2001

In 2008,
the Muon &lt;math&gt;g-2&lt;/math&gt; Collaboration at the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] published results after searching for signals of [[Standard-Model Extension|Lorentz violation]] with muons and antimuons.
In one type of analysis, they compared the anomaly frequencies
for the muon and its antiparticle. In another, they looked for sidereal variations by allocating their data into one-hour "bins" according to the orientation of the Earth relative to the Sun-centered inertial reference frame.
Their results, published in Physical Review Letters in 2008,&lt;ref name="bennett08"&gt;

show no signatures of [[Standard-Model Extension|Lorentz violation]] at the resolution of the Brookhaven experiment.

'''AquaMaps''' is a collaborative project with the aim of producing computer-generated (and ultimately, expert reviewed) predicted global distribution maps for [[Marine biology|marine species]] on a 0.5 x 0.5 degree [[Grid (spatial index)|grid]] of the [[ocean]]s based on data available through online species databases such as [[FishBase]] and [[SeaLifeBase]] and species occurrence records from [[OBIS]] or [[GBIF]] and using an environmental envelope model (see [[niche modelling]]) in conjunction with expert input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aquamaps.org/ |title=AquaMaps Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aquamaps.org/main/FB_Book_KReyes_AquaMaps_JG.pdf |author=Kesner-Reyes, K. |author2=K.

According to the AquaMaps website on August 2013, the project held standardized distribution maps for over 17,300 species of [[fish]]es, [[marine mammal]]s and [[invertebrate]]s.
The project is also expanding to incorporate [[Freshwater biology|freshwater]] species,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aquamaps.org/main/home_fw.php |title=Freshwater Biodiversity AquaMaps}}&lt;/ref&gt; with more than 600 biodiversity maps for freshwater fishes of the Americas available as at November 2009. AquaMaps predictions have been validated successfully for a number of species using independent data sets and the model was shown to perform equally well or better than other standard species distribution models, when faced with the currently existing suboptimal input data sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VBS-4XSCVHM-1&amp;_user=1634520&amp;_coverDate=02%2F10%2F2010&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1191986225&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000054038&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=1634520&amp;md5=01b6538e209644aaa13ac85d8b10f56f |author= Ready, J. |author2= K.

In addition to displaying individual maps per species, AquaMaps provides tools to generate species richness maps by higher taxon, plus a spatial search for all species overlapping a specified grid square. There is also the facility to create custom maps for any species via the web by modifying the input parameters and re-running the map generating algorithm in real time, and a variety of other tools including the investigation of effects of climate change on species distributions (see relevant section of the [http://www.aquamaps.org/ AquaMaps search page]).

[[File:JoekullsarlonBlueBlockOfIce.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Iceberg on [[Jökulsárlón]], Iceland]]
'''Blue ice''' occurs when snow falls on a [[glacier]], is compressed, and becomes part of the glacier.  Air bubbles are squeezed out and ice crystals enlarge, making the ice appear blue.

Small amounts of regular ice appear to be white because of air bubbles inside them and also because small quantities of water appear to be colourless. In glaciers, the pressure causes the air bubbles to be squeezed out, increasing the density of the created ice. Large quantities of [[color of water|water appear to be blue]], as it absorbs other colours more efficiently than blue. A large piece of compressed ice, or a glacier, similarly appears blue.

The blue color is sometimes wrongly attributed to [[Rayleigh scattering]], which is responsible for the color of the sky. Rather, water ice is blue for the same reason that [[Color of water|large quantities of liquid water are blue]]: it is a result of an [[Overtone band|overtone]] of an oxygen–hydrogen (O−H) [[Rotational-vibrational spectroscopy|bond stretch]] in water, which absorbs light at the red end of the visible spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.dartmouth.edu/~etrnsfer/water.htm |title= Why Is Water Blue?| first1= Charles L.|last1= Braun |first2=Sergei N.|last2= Smirnov |date=August 1993 | work= [[Journal of Chemical Education|J. Chem. Edu.]], 1993, 70(8), 612| publisher= [[Dartmouth College]]| accessdate=2013-12-22 |quote= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of oceans or lakes, some of the light hitting the surface of water is reflected back directly, but most of it penetrates the surface, interacting with its molecules. The water molecule can vibrate in different modes when light hits it. The red, orange, yellow, and green wavelengths of light are absorbed so that the remaining light is composed of the shorter wavelengths of blue and violet. This is the main reason why the [[ocean color|ocean]] is blue. So, water owes its intrinsic blueness to selective absorption in the red part of its visible spectrum. The absorbed photons promote transitions to high overtone and combination states of the nuclear motions of the molecule, i.e. to highly excited vibrations. 

An example of blue ice was observed in [[Tasman Glacier]], [[New Zealand]] in January 2011.&lt;ref name= "NZ_Herald_10699700"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/travel/news/article.cfm?c_id=7&amp;objectid=10699700 |title=NZ blue ice sighting an unexpected treat for tourists |last=Harvey |first= Eveline |date=14 January 2011 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antarctic runways==

Blue ice is exposed in areas of the [[Antarctic]] where there is no net addition or subtraction of [[snow]].  That is, any snow that falls in that area is counteracted by [[sublimation (physics)|sublimation]] or other losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_RXVBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT256&amp;dq=Blue+ice+is+exposed+in+areas+of+the+Antarctic+where+there+is+no+net+addition+or+subtraction+of+snow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwih44T0gI_XAhUU6mMKHcjwC0EQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Blue%20ice%20is%20exposed%20in%20areas%20of%20the%20Antarctic%20where%20there%20is%20no%20net%20addition%20or%20subtraction%20of%20snow&amp;f=false|title=Antarctic Lakes|last=Laybourn-Parry|first=Johanna|last2=Wadham|first2=Jemma|date=2014-08-14|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191649325|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These areas have been used as [[runway]]s (e.g. [[Wilkins Runway]], [[Novolazarevskaya]], [[Patriot Hills Base Camp]]) due to their hard surface, which is suitable for [[aircraft]] fitted with wheels rather than [[ski plane|skis]].

==Description==
He is generally described as short and ugly,&lt;ref name=FMLL&gt;[Fairies: The Myths, Legends, &amp; Lore], Skye Alexander, pg 202&lt;/ref&gt; with one leg shorter than the other and one foot either larger than the other,&lt;ref name=IT&gt;[http://www.iquitostimes.com/chullachaqui.htm "The Legend of Chullachaqui"], The Iquitos Times&lt;/ref&gt; pointed backward&lt;ref name=FMLL /&gt;&lt;ref name=IT/&gt; or in the form of a [[hoof]].&lt;ref name=PENG&gt;"The Penguin book of world folk tales", Milton Rugoff, page 604&lt;/ref&gt;

He is said to persuade his victims to follow him deep into the jungle where even experienced [[tracking (hunting)|trackers]] can not find their way back. He does this by [[shapeshifting|taking the form]] of a family member or a loved one long not seen, or disguising himself as a [[predation|prey]] animal.&lt;ref name=FMLL /&gt; His uncanny ability to replicate others makes him impossible to tell apart, except for his mismatched feet.

Others say that he appears in the shape of a very short man dressed in rags waving his closed fists in the air looking for a fight. In this case, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] believe a man must accept his challenge and beat him until he uncovers all the richness he has hidden in the jungle. He who declines this challenge is cursed with the inability to hunt and foul luck: family and friends turn into enemies, wife leaves with another man, etc.

Chullachaqui is said to have an ability to turn into any animal of the rainforest. Chullachaqui is a kind of a forest spirit who [[tutelary deity|guards]] the lands and the animals and punishes a man if he breaks a [[taboo]] or otherwise acts unwisely in the forest.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} According to a local legend, Chullachaqui is a member of an older species, a species that lived there long before humans.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Most of the time they remain quite uninterested in humans. They inhabit forest spots far from human inhabitance where they supposedly have their own gardens and fields to tend. If a human being dwells too close to those gardens, they might attack and put a spell on the unlucky human. Sometimes a Chullachaqui might also [[child abduction|steal a human child]] and raise it as its own, or lure humans into its trap for mating purposes. A human thus stolen by the Chullachaqui becomes one of them.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4292">[[Image:Korup.jpg|thumb|Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests.]]The '''Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests''' are a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[ecoregion]] of west-central [[Africa]]. This is lush forest rich in flora and birdlife.

==Location and description==
The region includes the lowland and coastal forests of southeastern [[Nigeria]], southwestern [[Cameroon]], and the lowlands of the island of [[Bioko]], covering an area of {{convert|52,200|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. The ecoregion extends from the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] in southeastern Nigeria to the [[Sanaga River]] in southeastern Cameroon, and up to 300&amp;nbsp;km inland from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast. In Nigeria the region more or less covers [[Cross River State]].

The highlands of [[Mount Cameroon]] and of Bioko island, above 900 meters elevation, are a distinct ecoregion, the [[Mount Cameroon and Bioko montane forests]], as are the [[Cameroonian Highlands forests]] further inland. To the west, across the Cross River, lies the [[Cross-Niger transition forests]] ecoregion. Towards the drier interior, the coastal forests transition to the [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]] to the north and the [[Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic]] to the east. South of the Sanaga River along the coast lies the [[Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests]] ecoregion.

The climate is wet with heavy rainfall all year round and many rivers cross the region as well as the Cross and the Sanaga.

==Flora==
The area is home to over 3,000 endemic species of plant, half of those found in West Africa, with nearly 2,000 found in Cameroon's [[Korup National Park]] alone.

==Fauna==
Wildlife in the area includes [[forest elephants]] and many primates such as [[Cross River gorilla]]s and [[chimpanzees]] (particularly in [[Cross River National Park]] in Nigeria), while [[Preuss's red colobus]] (''Procolobus pennanti preussi'') is found only in this ecoregion and a number of others are nearly endemic including [[red-eared guenon]] (''Cercopithecus erythrotis''), [[crowned guenon]] (''Cercopithecus pogonias''), [[drill (mammal)|drills]] (''Mandrillus leucophaeus''), [[northern needle-clawed bushbaby]] (''Euoticus pallidus''), and [[Pennant's colobus]], one population of which is found on Bioko. There is also a great variety of amphibians and reptlies including the [[Goliath frog]]. The forests are also extremely rich in butterflies including the ''[[Charaxes superbus]]'' and ''[[Charaxes acraeoides]]''.

==Threats==
In 2006, it was estimated that annually more than 1,3 million mammals, about 64,650 reptiles and at least 7,700 birds are hunted in the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests for the [[bushmeat]] trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Fa, J.E., Seymour, S., Dupain, J.E.F., Amin, R., Albrechtsen, L. and Macdonald, D. |year=2006 |title=Getting to grips with the magnitude of exploitation: bushmeat in the Cross–Sanaga rivers region, Nigeria and Cameroon |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=129 |issue=4 |pages=497–510 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_E_Fa/publication/223445717_Getting_to_grips_with_the_magnitude_of_exploitation_Bushmeat_in_the_Cross-Sanaga_Rivers_region_Nigeria_and_Cameroon/links/59e5ca83aca272390edffbf6/Getting-to-grips-with-the-magnitude-of-exploitation-Bushmeat-in-the-Cross-Sanaga-Rivers-region-Nigeria-and-Cameroon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation ==
One of the largest blocks of forest is in and around [[Korup National Park]], while 10% of area is in protected parkland.

==Visiting the region==
[[Korup National Park]] in Cameroon is one of the most accessible ways into the forest, while in Nigeria Cross River State can be accessed from the capital [[Calabar]], where there is a drill monkey sanctuary and from Calabar one can reach the [[Cross River National Park]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24070">'''Energy in Thailand''' refers to [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production, consumption, import and export in [[Thailand]]. According to the [[Ministry of Energy (Thailand)|Ministry of Energy]], the country's primary energy consumption was 75.2 [[Tonne of oil equivalent|Mtoe]] (million tonnes of oil equivalent) in 2013, an increase of 2.6 percent over the previous year.&lt;ref name="Facts 2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy in Thailand, Facts &amp; Figures 2013|url=http://weben.dede.go.th/webmax/sites/default/files/fact2013.pdf|publisher=Dept of Alternative Energy Development &amp; Efficiency, Ministry of Energy|accessdate=5 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to British Petroleum, energy consumption was 115.6 Mtoe in 2013.&lt;ref name=BP-2014 /&gt;

==Overview==
Thailand produces roughly one-third of the oil it consumes. It is the second largest importer of oil in SE Asia. Thailand is a large producer of natural gas, with reserves of at least 10 trillion [[Standard cubic foot|cubic feet]]. After Indonesia, it is the largest coal producer in Southeast Asia, but must import additional coal to meet domestic demand.

==Electricity==
Ninety percent of Thai electrical generating capacity is conventional thermal. Oil-fired plants have been replaced by natural gas, which as of 2016 powers 60 percent of electrical generation. Coal-fired plants produce an additional 20 percent, with the remainder from biomass, hydro, and biogas.&lt;ref name="Energy Security"/&gt; {{Asof|2018|5|31}} the 
[[Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand]] (EGAT) produces 37 percent of Thailand's electricity; independent power producers, 35 percent; small power producers, 19 percent; and electricity imports, 9 percent.&lt;ref name="Nation-20180625"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rujivanarom |first1=Pratch |title=Renewable energy should be focus of new power plan: expert |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30348517 |accessdate=25 June 2018 |work=The Nation |date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy experts working for the [[World Wildlife Fund]] have calculated that Thailand and four [[Greater Mekong Subregion|Mekong Region]] neighbours could achieve 100 percent renewable energy electricity generation by 2050. Their study showed that these countries can produce and use electricity from solar power, wind power, biogas, and small run-of-the-river hydroelectricity. The findings conflict with government plans that discount renewables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rujivanarom|first1=Pratch|title=Mekong region could rely on 100 percent clean energy by 2050: WWF|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Mekong-region-could-rely-on-100-clean-energy-by-20-30286636.html|accessdate=14 June 2016|work=The Nation|date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rising temperatures increase electricity demand. It is estimated that cities the size of Bangkok may require as much as 2 gigawatts of additional electricity for each increase of 1 degree Celsius in temperature due to increased demand for air conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shankleman|first1=Jessica|last2=Foroohar|first2=Kambiz|title=Soaring Temperatures Will Make It Too Hot to Work, UN Warns|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-19/soaring-temperatures-will-make-it-too-hot-to-work-un-warns|accessdate=21 July 2016|work=Bloomberg|date=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil==
[[File:Oil Balance Thailand.svg|thumb|Offshore production wasn't enough to bring the country close to self-reliance.]]

*Production: Thailand first began producing oil&lt;ref&gt;Includes crude oil, tight oil, oil sands, NGLs (natural gas liquids). Excludes liquid fuels from biomass and coal/NG derivatives.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1981, when it started producing 2,000 [[Barrel (unit)#Oil barrel|barrels]] (84,000 US gallons) per day. By 2013, daily production had increased to 459,000 barrels. Proved oil reserves are estimated at 0.4 thousand million barrels.&lt;ref name=BP-2014 /&gt;
*Consumption: Thailand's consumption in 2013 was 1.2 million barrels per day, a two percent increase over the previous year.&lt;ref name=BP-2014 /&gt;

==Gas==
[[File:Gas Balance Thailand.svg|thumb|Much of the country's gas is imported.]]

Natural gas fuels approximately 60 percent of Thailand's electrical power generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chevron Thailand to cut 800 jobs|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/business/news/975381/chevron-thailand-to-cut-800-jobs|accessdate=17 May 2016|work=Bangkok Post|agency=Reuters|date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Erawan gas field in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] supplies about 20 percent of Thailand's gas production. The field is estimated to have a capacity of 885 million [[Standard cubic foot|cf]] per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chevron to cut 800 workers|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/business/news/975765/chevron-to-cut-800-workers|accessdate=17 May 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coal==
In 2013 Thailand produced approximately 18 million [[tonne]]s of [[lignite]] and imported roughly 19 million tonnes of [[bituminous coal]]. All of the lignite and six million tonnes of the bituminous coal was used to produce electricity, the remainder being used by industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand: Coal for 2013|url=https://www.iea.org/statistics/statisticssearch/report/?year=2013&amp;country=Thailand&amp;product=Coal|website=International Energy Agency|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewable energy==
{{main|Renewable energy in Thailand}}
===Private solar power generation===
In March 2016, the Thai government gave approval for homes and commercial buildings to install solar panels. Each house will be permitted to generate 10 kW and each factory 40 kW. The private sector, despite Thailand's ample solar resources, previously had no right to install power-generation equipment. The government's plan is to devise regulations in March, hold public hearings in April, and roll out the program in the summer of 2016. Power generation is expected to start at the end of 2016 or early-2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Theparat|first1=Chatrudee|title=Solar rooftops, electric vehicles okayed|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/business/news/894780/solar-rooftops-electric-vehicles-okayed|accessdate=12 March 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Biofuel===
The government is promoting the production of [[biodiesel]] from palm oil to be blended with conventional diesel with the aim of reducing petroleum imports. The production goal is 5.97 million liters per day in 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ratchaniphont|first1=Adisorn|last2=Wongsai|first2=Sangdao|last3=Keson|first3=Jutaporn|title=Trend of carbon dioxide emission from oil palm plantation in Krabi, Thailand|url=http://nscj.co.uk/ecm3/sessions/174_AdisornRatchaniphont.pdf|website=North Sea Conference &amp; Journal|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear==
Thailand has no nuclear power plants. Earlier plans to produce five [[Watt#Gigawatt|gigawatts]] of electricity by 2025 using nuclear technology were scaled back to 2 GW in the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster.&lt;ref name="Energy Security"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Index of Energy Security Risk|url=http://www.energyxxi.org/sites/default/files/pdf/InternationalIndex-Final2013.pdf|website=Institute for 21st Century Energy|publisher=Institute for 21st Century Energy|accessdate=14 Sep 2014|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As memories of Fukushima recede, interest in nuclear power has revived. Seven ASEAN nations, including Thailand, have signed cooperation agreements with [[Rosatom]], Russia's state nuclear energy agency. EGAT is working with China, Japan, and South Korea on nuclear power generation technology and has sent 100 specialists to train for nuclear power plant projects. EGAT plans for up to five percent of the country's power generation to be generated from nuclear by 2036.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rujivanarom|first1=Pratch|title=With Russian help, region looks to a nuclear-powered future|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/With-Russian-help-region-looks-to-a-nuclear-powere-30288002.html|accessdate=14 June 2016|work=The Nation|date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thailand's Power Development Plan, 2015-2036==
According to Thailand's ''Power Development Plan for 2015-2036'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Energy Policy Committee approves Thailand’s power development plan (PDP 2015)|url=http://www.thaigov.go.th/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=91997:91997&amp;Itemid=398&amp;lang=en|website=Royal Thai Government|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pichalai |first1=Chavalit |title=Thailand’s Power Development Plan Thailand’s Power Development Plan 2015 (PDP 2015) |url=http://www.renewableenergy-asia.com/Portals/0/seminar/Presentation/02-Overview%20of%20Power%20Development%20Plan%20(PDP%202015).pdf |website=Ministry of Energy (Thailand) |accessdate=27 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124134209/http://www.renewableenergy-asia.com/Portals/0/seminar/Presentation/02-Overview%20of%20Power%20Development%20Plan%20%28PDP%202015%29.pdf |archivedate=24 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the country intends to build 20 additional gas-powered electrical generating stations (17,728 MWe), nine "clean coal" power stations (7,390 MWe), and 14,206 MW of renewable energy, including hydro, a large proportion of which will be imported from Laos or Myanmar. Up to two nuclear plants are also in the plans.&lt;ref name=Nation-20150827&gt;{{cite news|last1=Draper|first1=John|last2=Kamnuansilpa|first2=Peerasit|title=Thailand's power dilemma amid a climate of fear|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/opinion/Thailands-power-dilemma-amid-a-climate-of-fear-30267497.html|accessdate=27 August 2015|work=The Nation|date=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics charge that power needs are overstated. Thailand plans for a reserve margin—the amount of energy available over that used at peak demand—of 15 percent. However, the plan identifies reserve margins as high as 39 percent in some years. The root cause is that Thailand regularly overestimates its economic growth, assuming it to be over four percent when it is historically around three percent.&lt;ref name=Nation-20150827 /&gt;

The role of imported hydro is also at issue. In 2015, hydro accounted for approximately seven percent of Thailand's power output. Under the plan, it will rise to 15-20 percent by 2036, and additional hydro will be imported from the Xayaburi Dam on the Mekong River and from the Hat Gyi and Mong Ton dams in Myanmar. While these sources may look clean on Thailand's balance sheets, the devastating environmental impacts to locals are simply outsourced.&lt;ref name=Nation-20150827 /&gt;

Many have asked why Thailand pursues a few very large coal power plants when it could be adopting safer, possibly cheaper routes, such as biomass reactors, like the 40 MWe plant operated by Double A in Prachinburi using wood and offcuts. The answer may lie in the fact that large, centralised mega-projects benefit the centralised system of project approval. With a public sector corruption rate of 25 percent, according to the Thai Chamber of Commerce,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arunmas |first1=Pusadee  |title=Corruption 'still plagues Thailand'   |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/business/news/389964/corruption-till-plagues-thailand|accessdate=27 August 2015|work=Bangkok Post|date=17 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; they can be very beneficial for unscrupulous officials.&lt;ref name=Nation-20150827 /&gt;

== History of the electricity sector ==
=== Anand Panyarachun government ===
The government of [[Anand Panyarachun]] (1991-1992) began the process of energy industry liberalization. Its reforms included:
* Allowing private companies, independent power producers (IPPs), to build and operate power generation plants, selling all of their output to the [[Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand]] (EGAT)
* Allowing smaller private companies, SPPs or small power producers, to build and operate small power generation plants (mostly co-generation plants), selling a portion of their output to EGAT
* Delegating to the National Energy Policy Organization (NEPO) the task of developing a master plan for the privatization of EGAT. [[Piyasawat Amranand]], head of NEPO, designed a plan which would closely replicate the English [[power pool]], break EGAT up into several smaller companies, and privatize the smaller companies.

=== Chuan Leekpai government ===
The subsequent government of [[Chuan Leekpai]] (1992-1995, 1997-2001) continued Anand's policies, with Sawit Bhodivihok taking a leading role in industry reform. The reforms were fiercely attacked by members of the EGAT, Metropolitan Energy Authority (MEA), and Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) unions.  As a result, no significant changes in industry structure or ownership occurred during Chuan's term.

=== Thaksin Shinawatra government ===

==== Refining and pipelines ====
In September 2001, the National Energy Policy Office approved the partial listing of PTT, the state-owned oil and gas company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasandoil.com/goc/company/cns14513.htm Alexander's Gas &amp; Oil Connections - Thailand's energy office approves PTT's listing scheme]&lt;/ref&gt;

PTT swiftly became the largest company by market capitalization upon listing in the [[Stock Exchange of Thailand]] (SET).  PTT greatly profited from the global increase in worldwide oil prices following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and the rise in its stock price helped propel the SET to a boom.  However, anti-Thaksin critics have claimed that PTT's bull run was due to manipulation by Thaksin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pinkaew |first1=Tul |title=THAILAND: PM's cronies big winners, says study |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721230557/http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=36937 |accessdate=25 June 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |publisher=AsiaMedia |date=10 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Electricity generation and transmission ====
Like Chuan, Thaksin repeatedly attempted to privatize the [[Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand]] (EGAT). One of the goals of the privatization was to raise 42 billion baht from the IPO and use the funds to invest in three new natural-gas powered power plants.

In early-2004, massive employee protests forced the EGAT governor to resign, thus delaying the planned privatization of the state enterprise.  Governor Kraisri Karnasuta worked with employees to address their concerns about the privatization, and by December 2004, it was claimed that approximately 80 percent of employees supported privatization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gulfelectric.co.th/thai/popup_news.php?id=otVx7n8ved8KN28TCmQ3T0Ve5AybXaUmuvIN5vM4LVzfyAxMne |title=Egat employees say that union leader must go |accessdate=2014-04-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417215659/http://www.gulfelectric.co.th/thai/popup_news.php?id=otVx7n8ved8KN28TCmQ3T0Ve5AybXaUmuvIN5vM4LVzfyAxMne |archivedate=April 17, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Permanent protest stages and tents at the EGAT headquarters were taken down as the state enterprise returned to normal. After the Mahachon Party (the only party that was officially against privatization of state enterprises) won only two seats in the February 2005 parliamentary elections, the process of EGAT's privatization was restarted. The agency was corporatized in June 2005, transforming it from the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand to EGAT PLC.  However, EGAT's privatization was abruptly delayed when some NGOs and some union members filed a petition with the Supreme Court a few days before the scheduled listing on the [[Stock Exchange of Thailand]] (SET).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/12/business/data/business_19137516.html Delayed Egat listing would hit confidence]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 March 2006, the Supreme Administrative Court ruled against the privatization of EGAT PLC, citing conflicts of interest, public hearing irregularities, and the continued right of expropriation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.mybangkokpost.com/bkkarchives/frontstore/news_detail.html?aid=183621 Court quashes Egat listing]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/24/headlines/headlines_30000086.php Court ends privatisation of Egat]&lt;/ref&gt;  The court said that Olarn Chaipravat, a board member of PTT and Shin Corporation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pttplc.com/en/ptt_core.asp?page=ap_or_bo_detail&amp;id=40 |title=PTT Public Company Limited |accessdate=2006-06-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325074143/http://www.pttplc.com/en/ptt_core.asp?page=ap_or_bo_detail&amp;id=40 |archivedate=March 25, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (both business partners of EGAT), was on a committee involved in the legal preparation of Egat's privatisation. The court questioned the neutrality of Parinya Nutalai, chair of the public hearing panel on the EGAT listing, because he was Vice Minister of Natural Resources and the Environment.

It also ruled that insufficient opportunities were given to EGAT employees to make themselves heard. There was only one public hearing for employees, which only 1,057 attended. Lastly, EGAT PLC continued to have the right to expropriate public land to build power plants and transmission lines, a right reserved for the state. Two decrees were nullified: one ordering the dissolution of the status of EGAT as a state enterprise, and the other serving as a new charter for EGAT PLC.

Union leaders and anti-Thaksin protesters cheered the ruling, and called for the renationalization of other privatized state enterprises,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cartalucci|first=Tony|title=Thailand: Who are the Anti-Regime Protesters?|url=http://nsnbc.me/2013/12/04/thailand-anti-regime-protesters/|publisher=NSNBC International|accessdate=9 January 2014|date=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP) and Thai Airways International (both privatized in 1992),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thaiairways.com/About_Thai/Public_Information/Company_Profile/Developments.htm |title=About THAI |accessdate=2006-06-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525015315/http://thaiairways.com/About_Thai/Public_Information/Company_Profile/Developments.htm |archivedate=May 25, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ptt-ep.com/en/about_pttep/profile.asp |title=PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited |accessdate=2006-06-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512134345/http://www.ptt-ep.com/en/about_pttep/profile.asp |archivedate=May 12, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; PTT PCL, TOT PCL, MCOT PCL, Thailand Post Co Ltd, and CAT Telecom PCL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thailandpost.com/about_history_en.asp |title=Thailand Post ไปรษณีย์ไทย |accessdate=2006-06-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060327025215/http://www.thailandpost.com/about_history_en.asp |archivedate=March 27, 2006 |df= }} {{En icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like EGAT, PTT also retained land expropriation rights after it was privatized. However, this was one of the grounds for the nullification of the EGAT privatization. Caretaker Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya has noted that the delisting and renationalization of PTT could force the government to borrow massively from foreign institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/03/25/business/business_30000127.php PTT braces itself for legal action]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some criticized that the listing of PTT on the SET on the grounds that it represented a massive transfer of public assets for the benefit of few people. Though the government initially accepted over 100,000 first-time investors, there were reports that the majority of the shares for sale to retail investors had been reserved for politicians, the banks' preferred clients, and journalists, leaving many retail investors, who stood in long lines to wait, to return home empty-handed. A nephew of Suriya Juengrungruangkit, the minister of Industry overseeing PTT and TRT Party secretary general, for example, was reported to have acquired 22 times the maximum number of PTT shares distributed to retail investors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060525105700/http://palangthai.org/docs/PA77.3Thailand.pdf Thailand's Electricity Reforms: Privatization of Benefits and Socialization of Costs and Risks]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fears of this being repeated were often cited as the reason why EGAT's privatization was delayed indefinitely. Another key argument for delaying privatization was that privatization preceded the establishment of an independent energy regulatory authority. In international experience, there are no examples of successful monopoly utility privatization without regulatory oversight. Under pressure, Thaksin's government formed an interim electricity regulatory body, but some charged that it lacked authority to force compliance, levy fines, or punish defaulters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://netmeter.org/en/story/28 |title=NetMeter.org: The public interest, and the pursuit of profit |accessdate=2006-06-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202204706/http://netmeter.org/en/story/28 |archivedate=February 2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; EGAT employee concerns about employment security were also common. Some expressed concern that partial ownership of Thailand's largest electricity producer by foreign shareholders would impact national security and cause conflicts of interest.

Anti-privatization petitioners (including the Confederation of Consumer Organisations, People Living with HIV/Aids, Alternative Energy Project for Sustainability, [[Free Trade Area]] Watch, and the Four Region Slum Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://netmeter.org/en/story/39 |title=NetMeter.org: Egat investors forewarned |accessdate=2006-06-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202204942/http://netmeter.org/en/story/39 |archivedate=February 2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) were harshly criticized by both Thai and international investors, who accused them of using corrupt tactics in delaying the listing. They also pointed to the public mandate of the 2005 election, during which the only anti-privatization party suffered a near complete loss. International power sector governance experts from Harvard University, University of Delaware, and the World Resources Institute lauded the successful repeal of EGAT privatization as an important step towards increased accountability and transparency in the Thai energy industry.

[[File:Carolus Clusius by Martin Rota.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Carolus Clusius at 49 years of age]]
'''''Exoticorum libri decem''''' ("Ten books of exotic life forms") is an illustrated zoological and botanical compendium in [[Latin]], published at [[Leiden]] in 1605 by [[Charles de l'Écluse]].&lt;ref name="L'Écluse1605"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles de L'Écluse|title=Caroli Clusii Atrebatis,... Exoticorum libri decem: quibus animalium, plantarum, aromatum, aliorumque peregrinorum fructuum historiae describuntur : item...

On the title page the author's name appears in its well-known Latin form '''Carolus Clusius'''. The full title is: ''Exoticorum libri decem, quibus animalium, plantarum, aromatum, aliorumque peregrinorum fructuum historiae describuntur'' ("Ten books of exotica: the history and uses of animals, plants, aromatics and other natural products from distant lands").

Clusius was not only an original biologist but also a remarkable linguist. He became well known as a translator and editor of the works of others. ''Exoticorum libri decem'' consists partly of his own discoveries, partly of translated and edited versions of earlier publications, always properly acknowledged, and with many new illustrations. Separately identifiable within this compendium can be found Clusius's Latin translations, with his own notes, from:

*[[Garcia de Orta]], ''[[Colóquios dos Simples e Drogas da India|Colóquios dos simples e drogas he cousas medicinais da Índia]]'' (1563)
*[[Nicolás Monardes]], ''[[Historia medicinal de las cosas que se traen de nuestras Indias Occidentales]]'' (1565–1574)
*[[Cristóbal Acosta]], ''Tractado de las drogas y medicinas de las Indias orientales'' (1578)

There is also material by [[Prospero Alpini]] (Prosper Alpinus) with notes by Clusius. As a separately paginated appendix appears Clusius's Latin translation (first published in 1589) of:

*[[Pierre Belon]], ''[[Observations (Pierre Belon)|Observations]]'' (1553)

[[File:Passer russatus Fauna Japonica.jpg|thumb|An illustration of a [[russet sparrow]] pair from the ''Fauna Japonica'']]
'''''Fauna Japonica''''' is a [[monographic series|series of monographs]] on the [[zoology]] of [[Japan]].

The full title is ''Fauna Japonica sive Descriptio animalium, quae in itinere per Japoniam, jussu et auspiciis superiorum, qui summum in India Batava imperium tenent, suscepto, annis 1825 - 1830 collegit, notis, observationibus et adumbrationibus illustravit Ph. Fr. de Siebold. Conjunctis studiis C. J. Temminck et H. Schlegel pro vertebratis atque W. de Haan pro invertebratis elaborata''.

Based on the collections made by [[Philipp Franz von Siebold]] (who edited the text) and his successor [[Heinrich Bürger]] in Japan, Fauna Japonica’s vertebrate volumes were authored by the Leyden Museum naturalists [[Coenraad Jacob Temminck]] and [[Hermann Schlegel]]. [[Wilhem de Haan]], also at the Leyden museum wrote the invertebrate volumes assisted by the Japanese artist naturalists [[Keiga Kawahara]] [[Kurimoto Masayoshi]] and others.

It was published serially in five volumes between 1833 and 1850.

This was the first book written in a European language ([[French language|French]]) on the Japanese fauna.

'''Feldmark''', also spelt '''fjaeldmark''' ({{etymology|no||mountain field}}), is a [[plant community]] characteristic of sites where plant growth is severely restricted by extremes of cold and exposure to wind, typical of [[alpine tundra]] and [[subantarctic]] environments.

==Description==
Feldmark plant communities are characterised by scattered dwarf and prostrate plants, up to about {{convert|25|cm|0|abbr=on}} in height, often with a mat or [[cushion plant|cushion]] habit, among patches of bare ground and exposed rock.

==Distribution==
Feldmark occurs in the least favourable situations for plant growth, including late-lying snowdrift areas on leeward slopes and cold, highly wind-exposed ridges. Because feldmark species are adapted to cold bare ground, some are able to colonise areas of severe [[erosion]] where the [[topsoil]] has been removed, leaving only a surface of broken rock or stones.&lt;ref name="kaf"&gt;{{Harvnb|Costin et al.|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In areas with strong prevailing winds, expansion through [[layering]] on the sheltered sides of plants means that they may grow preferentially on the protected sides and gradually move downwind across the landscape.{{sfn|McDougall|Wright|2004}}

[[File:0-4-0-engine.JPG|thumb|Preserved [[H.K. Porter, Inc.]] No. 3290 of 1923 powered by compressed air]]
A '''fireless locomotive''' is a type of [[locomotive]] which uses [[reciprocating engine]]s powered from a reservoir of [[Pneumatics|compressed air]] or steam, which is filled at intervals from an external source. They offer advantages over conventional [[steam locomotive]]s of lower cost per unit, cleanliness, and decreased risk from fire or [[boiler explosion]]; these are counterbalanced by the need for a source to refill the locomotive, and by the limited range afforded by the reservoir.

Typical usage was in industrial switching where a conventional locomotive was too noxious or risky, such as in a mine or a food or chemical factory; they also saw use where the source of air or steam was readily available.

They were eventually displaced by [[diesel locomotive|diesel]] and [[Battery locomotive|battery electric]] locomotives fitted with protective appliances; these are described as '''flame-proof''' locomotives.&lt;ref name="IRS 15EL"&gt;{{cite book | author = Industrial Railway Society | title = Industrial Locomotives (15EL) | publisher = Industrial Railway Society | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-901556-53-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:FLEURY CCCC - Locomotive sans foyer, système Lamm Franck pour chemin de fer sur route, construite en 1888.JPG|thumb|Lamm &amp; Francq fireless tram engine, 1888]]
An early application of the fireless locomotive was to [[Tram|street tramways]] in the USA. [[Emile Lamm]] developed two types of fireless locomotive,&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|125577}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|105581}}&lt;/ref&gt; one using [[ammonia]] and the other using stored steam.&lt;ref name="The Streetcars of New Orleans"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Streetcars of New Orleans |author=Louis C. Hennick |author2=Elbridge Harper Charlton |date = 1965 |issue = |volume = |publisher =Pelican Publishing |isbn=9781455612598 |pages =14–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lamm founded two companies, ''Ammonia &amp; Thermo-Specific Propelling Company of America'' in 1872 and (with Sylvester L. Langdon) ''[[Lamm Fireless Engine Company]]'' in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oAgxzQPeAjwC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=Lamm+%26+Francq&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a78JAGsgvi&amp;sig=0FIZAp-g9zSQwYEjy2dHkfkj-EI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=H3yoVKj7D4nYarTmgdAM&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Lamm%20%26%20Francq&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lamm's fireless engine]]s were briefly popular, both in the USA and in France, but were soon displaced by [[electric tram]]s. The French locomotives were built in association with [[:fr:Léon Francq|Leon Francq]], under the name ''Lamm &amp; Francq''.

The fireless system then gained a new lease of life for industrial [[Switcher|shunting locomotives]]. Any factory which possessed a stationary boiler could use it to charge a fireless steam locomotive for internal shunting operations. Fireless shunting locomotives became especially popular in Germany and some remained in service into the 1960s. Fireless industrial shunters were usually of the [[0-4-0]] or [[0-6-0]] wheel arrangement but some [[0-8-0]]s were built, by companies including [[Heisler locomotive|Heisler]]. Pennsylvania Power and Light "D", in the gallery below, is an example of an 0-8-0 fireless Heisler locomotive.&lt;ref name="DK"&gt;{{cite book|title=Train: The Definitive Visual History|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781465436580|page=157|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LrWBBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=0-8-0+fireless+locomotive&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9lva62InTAhWc0YMKHbqDDSAQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=0-8-0%20fireless%20locomotive&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss company, DLM, was recently (2012) trying to promote the fireless steam locomotive as an environmentally-friendly alternative to the [[diesel locomotive]] for shunting. DLM claims that diesel shunters typically spend 75% of their working time with the engine idling.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dlm-ag.ch/en/news?start=10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motive power types==

=== Steam ===
A fireless steam locomotive is similar to a conventional [[steam locomotive]], but has a reservoir, known as a [[steam accumulator]], instead of a [[boiler]].  This reservoir is charged with [[superheated water]] under pressure from a stationary boiler. The engine works like a conventional [[steam engine]] using the high pressure steam above the water in the accumulator. As the steam is used and pressure drops, the superheated water boils, replacing the used steam. The locomotive can work like this until the pressure has dropped to a minimum useful level or the water runs out, after which it must be recharged.

European fireless steam locomotives usually have the cylinders at the back, while American ones often have the cylinders at the front, as in a conventional locomotive.  Major builders of fireless steam locomotives in the UK included [[Andrew Barclay &amp; Sons Co.|Andrew Barclay]] and [[W.G. Bagnall]].

===Compressed air===
The first locomotive to run on [[Compressed-air vehicle|compressed air]] was built in 1890, and by 1895, the basic principles of efficient compressed air engines had been developed. A particularly important engineering breakthrough was the development of the reducing and stop valve which maintains a uniform pressure of air to the engine, even as the pressure in the storage tank reduces with use.&lt;ref name=Sinclair&gt;{{cite book |title=Development of the locomotive engine |last=Sinclair |first=Angus |date=1907 |publisher=Angus Sinclair Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compressed air locomotives have been used for many years, mainly in [[Mining|mines]],&lt;ref&gt;See "Compressed Air Locomotives," Baldwin Locomotive Works Record of Recent Construction No. 46 (1904).&lt;/ref&gt; but have also been used on [[Tramway (industrial)|tramways]].  (See [[Mekarski system]])

=== Hybrid ===
Several [[hybrid locomotive]]s have been built that have either used a fire for part of the time, e.g., [[Fowler's Ghost]] of London's [[Metropolitan Railway|Metropolitan]] in 1861, or have used a fire to [[Superheater|superheat]] stored steam, such as the Receiver Locomotives built by [[Sentinel Waggon Works]].  None has been a success.

==Wheel arrangements==

Most fireless locomotives have been of [[0-4-0]] or [[0-6-0]] wheel arrangement but there have been some [[0-8-0]] and even a few [[0-10-0]].  Some {{RailGauge|600mm}} gauge 0-10-0 fireless locomotives from the German company [[Henschel &amp; Son|Henschel]] were used in the construction of the [[Baghdad Railway]], probably to avoid the risk of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] during the boring of tunnels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trainsofturkey.com/w/pmwiki.php/Network/CilicianGates Cilician Gates], accessed 2007-09-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Another German company, [[Hohenzollern Locomotive Works|Hohenzollern]], built some [[Articulated locomotive|articulated]] fireless steam locomotives with a cab at each end.  Only one of the [[bogie]]s was powered, making the wheel arrangement [[AAR wheel arrangement#B-2|B-2]].

==Current use==
Steam traction became obsolete in the 1940s and was largely replaced by diesel or electric traction.{{Citation needed|reason=1950s would be more acurate|date=April 2018}} However, fireless steam has its merits, especially where there is an abundant cheap source of steam, such as in industrial sites, at [[thermal power station]]s or refuse [[incineration|incineration plants]], where fireless steam locomotives are used for shunting at very low cost.

As they do not emit any exhaust except steam, they can shunt into buildings without endangering the workforce with noxious fumes.

Considering that shunting locomotives are typically working for only about 10% of the time, 90% waiting for work; a [[diesel locomotive]], idling most of the time, burns too much fuel producing nothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineering.zhaw.ch/de/engineering/ueber-uns/aktuelles/veranstaltungsreihen/energie-und-umweltapero/archiv.html presentation at [[Zurich University of Applied Sciences/ZHAW|ZHAW Winterthur]], in German, 2013-03-13]&lt;/ref&gt; A well insulated modern steam accumulator can preserve pressure over many hours. Thus the operating cost of a fireless steam shunter can be far less than that of a comparable diesel.

Fireless locomotives are also safer to operate than conventional steam locomotives, aside from the elimination of ignition hazards. The primary cause of a locomotive [[boiler explosion]] is the depletion of boiler water, through inattention or excessive use, exposing the [[crown sheet]] directly to the flames of the firebox without the cooling effect of the water covering, weakening it to the point of failure. A fireless locomotive eliminates this danger—if it runs out of sufficient water, it simply ceases to move—although precautions must be taken as with any other [[pressure vessel]]. Furthermore, they did not require careful monitoring of water levels and boiler pressure, nor careful distribution of coal in the firebox for efficient combustion, and thus could be operated by less-skilled staff, not requiring a fully qualified locomotive engineer and fireman.

===Germany===
Several locomotive builders produced fireless engines throughout the 20th century. [[Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works]] was still building them in the 1980s. Some fireless locomotives are in daily use even in 2016. One example is the large coal-fired power station in [[Mannheim]] where coal is delivered by rail in long trains of self-discharging hopper wagons. Three fireless engines are used to shunt the hoppers on the premises of the power station.

East Germany, preferring to use its abundant supply of lignite to imported fuel, used fireless engines extensively. A series of 200 fireless locomotives was built at [[Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works|Raw Meiningen]] as late as the 1980s.

===Indonesia===
There are two places in Indonesia where fireless locomotives can be found in working condition. 
The first one is Semboro sugar mill in [[Jember]] , East Java&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internationalsteam.co.uk/trains/fireless.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Their presence is needed due to risk of fire posed by flammable materials like sugarcane bagasse. Both locos were built by Orenstein &amp; Koppel in Germany in 1928 and 1929 respectively&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internationalsteam.co.uk/trains/javalist.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. As in 2017, both locos are still used for shunting inside the mill's complex&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pTam3qi2J4&lt;/ref&gt;. 
The second one is Pagottan sugar mill in [[Madiun]], also in East Java. These [[Luttermöller axle]] locomotives, numbered 6, 7 and 8, were originally conventional steam locomotives who feature fireboxes. Due to closure of field lines, as well as money saving measure by mill's management, they were converted to fireless configuration in 2011&lt;ref&gt;http://www.internationalsteam.co.uk/trains/java11.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Switzerland===
Switzerland had used older fireless engines in industry, such as breweries. In 2010, the steam company [[Dampflokomotiv- und Maschinenfabrik DLM]] refurbished two locomotives of the German ''Meiningen'' type and modernised them for use on sidings.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlm-ag.ch/en/news/175-vorfuehrungen-der-dlm-speicherlokomotiven-in-schaffhausen Shunting in [[Schaffhausen]] 2012-09-07]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
Numerous examples have been preserved across the world.

===Germany===
The German Wikipedia has a list of steam accumulator locomotives preserved in that country.
It includes over 100 preserved fireless engines, 8 of them operational.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Liste in Deutschland vorhandener Dampfspeicherlokomotiven]] List over fireless locomotives in Germany (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
The Mexico City railroad museum  has a fireless steam locomotive [[Davenport Locomotive Works|Davenport]] no. 013 "Sin Fuego". It was a donated by [[Pemex]] and operated from 1940s – 1990s at the 18 de marzo refinery&lt;ref name=notimex&gt;{{cite news|title=Llega locomotora “sin fuego” al Museo de los Ferrocarrileros|url=http://www.periodicoenfoque.com.mx/2014/08/llega-locomotora-sin-fuego-al-museo-de-los-ferrocarriles/|accessdate=10 January 2018|agency=NOTIMEX|publisher=Enfoque|date=4 August 2014}} (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;.

===South Africa===
The Electricity Supply Commission of South Africa (ESKOM) has preserved two fireless steam locomotives. They are [[W. G. Bagnall|Bagnall]] 0-6-0F no. 2571 of 1937 and [[Hawthorne Leslie]] 0-4-0F no. 3858 of 1935.

===United Kingdom===
One notable example is "Lord Ashfield" ([[Andrew Barclay &amp; Sons Co.|Andrew Barclay]] works no. 1989 of 1930) at the [[Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester]]. It ran in limited service in the 1990s sharing a steam supply with the stationary exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mywarrington.me.uk/peter_tracks_65_lord_ashfield_msi_3-11-91.jpg Photo of ''Lord Ashfield'' 'in steam'.]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (Accessed 14 Feb 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Industrial Railway Centre|Ayrshire Railway Preservation Group]] has rebuilt its [[Andrew Barclay &amp; Sons Co.|Andrew Barclay]] 0-4-0 fireless locomotive (Works Number 1952 of 1928).  The engine returned to service in 2015, and operates as part of a demonstration freight train. &lt;ref&gt;http://arpg.org.uk/wp/&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The North Carolina Transportation Museum in Spencer has a fireless steam locomotive, the North Carolina Power and Light #3 0-4-0.

Three [[National Cash Register]] 0-4-0 fireless switchers have been preserved: one at [[Carillon Historical Park]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]],&lt;ref&gt;"The Little Engines that Could",http://www.daytonhistorybooks.com/little.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Info for Lima Locomotive Works C/N 1087,"http://www.steamlocomotive.info/vlocomotive.cfm?Display=934"&lt;/ref&gt; one at the [[Southeastern Railway Museum]] in [[Duluth, Georgia]],&lt;ref&gt;Info for Lima Locomotive Works C/N 1310,"http://steamlocomotive.info/vlocomotive.cfm?Display=357"&lt;/ref&gt; and one at the National Museum of Transportation in Kirkwood, Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;Info for Lima Locomotive Works C/N 1139,"http://steamlocomotive.info/vlocomotive.cfm?Display=1744"&lt;/ref&gt;

Pennsylvania Power and Light "D", an 0-8-0 switcher, is preserved in the [[Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania]].

Union Electric Company 4, a 0-4-0 is preserved in the Illinois Railway Museum of Union Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irm.org/cgi-bin/rsearch.cgi?steam=Union+Electric+Company=4&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, an 0-6-0 built by the H.K. Porter Company, is preserved in the Mad River and NKP Railroad Museum in Bellevue, Ohio&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mad River &amp; NKP Railroad Museum|url = http://madrivermuseum.org|website = madrivermuseum.org|accessdate = 2015-08-23|first = Mad River &amp; NKP Railroad|last = Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North American Rayon Company, 1936 H.K. Porter Company, 0-6-0F Fireless Locomotive, Elizabethton, Tennessee, U.S.A 
The locomotive was called "The Pot".  This rare fireless locomotive was built in 1936 for the North American Rayon Company(N.A.R.C.) of Elizabethton, Tennessee. Its steam was supplied from a large reservoir located inside of the N.A.R.C. plant. Fireless locomotives were used in industrial situations where there was an increased risk of fire. N.A.R.C. made Rayon, which is a highly flammable material. The locomotive retired from service in 1992 and it is possibly the last fireless locomotive to be retired from service in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.steamcentral.com/archive/arch00q1.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; N.A.R.C. shutdown in 2000 and donated "The Pot" to the Carter County Chamber of Commerce and is on public display in Elizabethton,TN.

{{Redirect|glacier retreat}}

[[Image:Glacial lakes, Bhutan.jpg|thumb|right|300px|This image shows the termini of the glaciers in the [[Bhutan]]-[[Himalaya]]. Glacial lakes have been rapidly forming on the surface of the debris-covered glaciers in this region during the last few decades. USGS researchers have found a strong correlation between increasing temperatures and glacial retreat in this region.]]

'''Glacial motion''' is the motion of [[glacier]]s, which can be likened to rivers of ice. It has played an important role in sculpting many landscapes. Most lakes in the world occupy basins scoured out by glaciers. Glacial motion can be fast (up to 30 m/day, observed on [[Jakobshavn Isbræ]] in [[Greenland]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarcticglaciers.org/question/fastest-slowest-moving-glaciers-earth/ |title=Table of fastest glacier speeds at |publisher=Antarcticglaciers.org |date= |accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; or slow (0.5 m/year on small glaciers or in the center of ice sheets), but is typically around 1 metre/day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/tbw/ncc/Notes/chap3.landforms/erosion.deposition/glaciers.htm |title=Glacier properties Hunter College CUNY lectures |access-date=2014-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222172708/http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/tbw/ncc/Notes/chap3.landforms/erosion.deposition/glaciers.htm |archive-date=2014-02-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processes of motion==
Glacier motion occurs from four processes, all driven by gravity: [[basal sliding]], [[glacial quake]]s generating fractional movements of large sections of ice, bed [[deformation (science)|deformation]], and internal deformation.
* In the case of '''[[basal sliding]]''', the entire glacier slides over its bed. This type of motion is enhanced if the bed is soft sediment, if the glacier bed is thawed and if [[meltwater]] is prevalent.
* '''Bed [[deformation (science)|deformation]]''' is thus usually limited to areas of sliding. Seasonal melt ponding and penetrating under glaciers shows seasonal acceleration and deceleration of ice flows affecting whole icesheets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/297/5579/218 Surface Melt-Induced Acceleration of Greenland Ice-Sheet Flow] Originally published in Science Express on 6 June 2002, Science 12 July 2002: Vol. 297. no. 5579, pp. 218 - 222.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some glaciers experience '''[[glacial quake]]s'''—glaciers "as large as Manhattan and as tall as the Empire State Building, can move 10 meters in less than a minute, a jolt that is sufficient to generate moderate seismic waves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Harvard News Office |url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/04.06/05-ekstrom.html |title=Global warming yields 'glacial earthquakes' in polar areas |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date=2006-04-06 |accessdate=2013-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927235031/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/04.06/05-ekstrom.html |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been an increasing pattern of these ice quakes - "Quakes ranged from six to 15 per year from 1993 to 2002, then jumped to 20 in 2003, 23 in 2004, and 32 in the first 10 months of 2005."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8889.html Glacial earthquakes rock Greenland ice sheet] 12:36 24 March 2006, NewScientist.com news service&lt;/ref&gt; A glacier that is frozen up to its bed does not experience basal sliding.
* '''Internal deformation''' occurs when the weight of the ice causes the deformation of ice crystals. This takes place most readily near the glacier bed, where pressures are highest.  There are glaciers that primarily move via sliding, glacial quakes, and others that move almost entirely through deformation.

== Terminus movement and mass balance {{anchor|glacial advance|glacial retreat|terminus|mass balance}} == 
If a glacier's [[Glacier terminus|terminus]] moves forward faster than it melts, the net result is advance. '''[[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|Glacier retreat]]''' occurs when more material ablates from the terminus than is replenished by flow into that region.

Glaciologists consider that trends in [[Glacier mass balance|mass balance]] for glaciers are more fundamental than the advance or retreat of the termini of individual glaciers. In the years since 1960, there has been a striking decline in the overall volume of glaciers worldwide. This decline is correlated with [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/064.htm |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |date= |accessdate=2013-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901175741/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/064.htm |archivedate=2014-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a glacier thins, due to the loss of mass it will slow down and crevassing will decrease.

==Landscape and geology==
Studying glacial motion and the landforms that result requires tools from many different disciplines: [[physical geography]], [[climatology]], and [[geology]] are among the areas sometime grouped together and called [[earth science]].

During the [[Pleistocene]] (the last [[ice age]]), huge sheets of ice called continental glaciers advanced over much of the earth. The movement of these continental glaciers created many now-familiar [[glacial landforms]]. As the glaciers were expanded, due to their accumulating weight of snow and ice, they crushed and redistributed surface rocks, creating [[glacial landforms|erosional landforms]] such as [[Wiktionary:striation|striation]]s, [[cirque (landform)|cirques]], and [[hanging valley]]s. Later, when the glaciers retreated leaving behind their freight of crushed rock and sand, [[glacial landforms|depositional landforms]] were created, such as [[moraine]]s, [[esker]]s, [[drumlin]]s, and [[kame]]s. The stone walls found in [[New England]] (northeastern [[United States]]) contain many [[glacial erratic]]s, rocks that were dragged by a glacier many miles from their bedrock origin.

At some point, if an [[Alpine glacier]] becomes too thin it will stop moving.  This will result in the end of any basal erosion. The stream issuing from the glacier will then become clearer as [[Rock flour|glacial flour]] diminishes. Lakes and ponds can also be caused by glacial movement. [[Kettle lake]]s form when a retreating glacier leaves behind an underground chunk of ice. Moraine-dammed lakes occur when a stream (or snow runoff) is dammed by [[glacial till]].

[[File:Che Guevara.jpg|thumb|[[Che Guevara|Ernesto "Che" Guevara]] smoking a cigar in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], 1963]]
'''Guevarism''' is a theory of [[communist revolution]] and a [[military strategy]] of [[guerilla warfare]] associated with [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara|Ernesto "Che" Guevara]], a leading figure of the [[Cuban Revolution]] who believed in the idea of [[Marxism–Leninism]] and embraced its principles.&lt;ref name="Hansing4142"&gt;[[#refHansing2002|Hansing 2002]], pp 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
After the 1959 triumph of the Cuban [[insurrection]] led by a militant [[foco]] under [[Fidel Castro]], his Argentine-born, cosmopolitan and Marxist colleague, Guevara parlayed his ideology and experiences into a model for emulation (and at times, direct military intervention) around the globe. While exporting one such "[[Foco|focalist]]" revolution to [[Bolivia]], leading an armed [[Vanguardism|vanguard party]] there in October 1967, Guevara was captured and executed, becoming a martyr to both the [[History of communism|world communist movement]] and [[History of socialism|socialism]] in general.

His ideology promotes exporting revolution to any country whose leader is supported by the empire (United States) and has fallen out of favor with its citizens. Guevara talks about how constant [[guerrilla warfare]] taking place in non-urban areas can overcome leaders. He introduces three points that are representative of his ideology as a whole, namely that the people can win with proper organization against a nation's army; that the conditions that make a revolution possible can be put in place by the popular forces; and that the popular forces always have an advantage in a non urban setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guevara|first=Ernesto|authorlink=Che Guevara|title=Guerrilla Warfare|publisher=New York: Monthly Review Press, 1961|date=1998|isbn=978-0-8032-7075-6|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guevara had a particularly keen interest in guerrilla warfare, with a dedication to foco techniques, also known as focalism (or ''foquismo'' in Spanish), which is vanguardism by small armed units, frequently in place of established [[Communist party|Communist Parties]], initially launching attacks from rural areas to mobilize unrest into a [[popular front]] against a sitting regime. Despite differences in approach—emphasizing guerrilla leadership and audacious raids that engender general uprising, rather than consolidating political power in military strongholds before expanding to new ones—Guevara took great inspiration from the [[Maoism|Maoist]] notion of "[[protracted people's war]]" and sympathized with [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's Republic of China]] in the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. This controversy may partly explain his departure from Castro's pro-Soviet [[Cuba]] in the mid-1960s. Guevara also drew direct parallels with his contemporary Communist comrades in the [[Viet Cong]], exhorting a multi-front guerrilla strategy to create "two, three, many [[Vietnam]]s".

In Guevara's final years, after leaving Cuba he advised Communist [[paramilitary]] movements in [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]], including a young [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], future ruler of [[Zaire]]/[[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Finally, while leading a small focalist band of guerrilla [[Cadre (politics)|cadres]] in Bolivia, Guevara was captured and killed. His death and the short-term failure of his Guevarist tactics may have interrupted the component guerrilla wars within the larger [[Cold War]] for a time and even temporarily discouraged Soviet and Cuban sponsorship for focalism.

The emerging Communist movements and other [[fellow traveler]] radicalism of the time either switched to [[urban guerrilla warfare]] before the end of the 1960s and/or soon revived the rural-based strategies of both Maoism and Guevarism, tendencies that escalated worldwide throughout the 1970s, by and large with the support from the [[List of socialist states|Communist states]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in general as well as Castro's Cuba in particular.

Another proponent of Guevarism was the French intellectual [[Régis Debray]], who could be seen as attempting to establish a coherent, unitary theoretical framework on these grounds. Debray has since broken with this.

== Criticism ==
Guevarism has been criticized from a revolutionary anarchist perspective by [[Abraham Guillén]], one of the leading tacticians of urban guerrilla warfare in [[Uruguay]] and [[Brazil]]. Guillen claimed that cities are a better ground for the guerrilla than the countryside (Guillen was a veteran of the [[Spanish Civil War]]). He criticized Guevarist [[Wars of national liberation|movements of national liberation]] (like the Uruguayan [[Tupamaros]], one of the many groups that he helped as a military advisor) for trying to impose a [[dictatorship]] instead of self-management.

'''Humboldtian science''' refers to a movement in [[science]] in the 19th century closely connected to the work and writings of German scientist, naturalist and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. It maintained a certain ethics of precision and observation, which combined scientific field work with the sensitivity and aesthetic ideals of the age of [[Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Böhme, Hartmut: Ästhetische Wissenschaft, in: Matices, Nr. 23, 1999, S. 37-41&lt;/ref&gt;  Like [[Romanticism in science]], it was rather popular in the 19th century. The term was coined by [[Susan Faye Cannon]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, Susan Faye: ''Science in Culture: The Early Victorian Period'', New York 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dettelbach, Michael: "Humboldtian Science", in: Jardine, N./Secord, J./Sparry, E. C.(eds): ''Cultures of Natural History'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1996&lt;/ref&gt;
The example of Humboldt's life and his writings allowed him to reach out beyond the academic community with his natural history and address a wider audience with popular science aspects. It has supplanted the older [[Baconian method]], related as well to a single person, [[Francis Bacon]].

==Brief biography==
{{main|Alexander von Humboldt}}
[[File:Stieler, Joseph Karl - Alexander von Humboldt - 1843.jpg|thumb|Alexander von Humboldt]]
Humboldt was born in [[Berlin]] in 1769 and worked as a Prussian mining official in the 1790s until 1797 when he quit and began collecting scientific knowledge and equipment.&lt;ref name="Jardine p. 288"&gt;Jardine et al., ''Cultures of Natural History'', p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; His extensive wealth aided his infatuation with the spirit of [[Romanticism]]; he amassed an extensive collection of scientific instruments and tools as well as a sizeable library. In 1799 Humboldt, under the protection of King [[Charles IV of Spain]], left for South America and [[New Spain]], toting all of his tools and books.&lt;ref name="Jardine p. 288"/&gt; The purpose of the voyage was steeped in Romanticism; Humboldt intended to investigate how the forces of nature interact with one another and find out about the unity of nature. Humboldt returned to Europe in 1804 and was acclaimed as a public hero. The details and findings of Humboldt's journey were published in his ''Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equatorial Regions of the New Continent'' (30 volumes). This ''Personal Narrative'' was taken by [[Charles Darwin]] on his famous voyage on [[H.M.S Beagle]].&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, ''Science in Culture'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt spent the rest of his life mainly in Europe, although he did embark on a short expedition to Siberia and the Russian steppes in 1829. Humboldt's last works were contained in his book, ''[[Kosmos: Entwurf einer physischen Weltbeschreibung]]'' ("Cosmos. Sketch for a Physical Description of the Universe"). The book mainly described the development of a life-force from the cosmos, but also included the formation of [[star]]s from [[nebular clouds]] as well as the geography of planets. Alexander von Humboldt died in 1859, while working on the fifth volume of ''Kosmos''.&lt;ref name="Jardine p. 288"/&gt;
Through his travels to South America and his observational records in ''An Essay on the Geography of Plants'' as well as [[Kosmos (Humboldt)|''Kosmos'']], an important trend emerged through his techniques of observation, scientific instruments used and unique perspective on nature. Humboldt's novel style has been defined as Humboldtian Science. Humboldt had the ability to combine the study of empirical data with a holistic view of nature and its aesthetically pleasing characteristics, which is now held to be the true definition of the study of vegetation and plant geography.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson, Malcolm. 1987. "Alexander von Humboldt, Humboldtian science, and the origins of the study of vegetation." History of Science. 25: 167-194.&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldtian science is one of the first techniques for studying both organic and inorganic branches of science.&lt;ref&gt;Home, Roderick Weir. 1995. "Humboldtian Science revisited: an Australian case study." History of Science. 33: 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Examining the interconnectedness of vegetation and its respective environment is one of the new and important aspects of Humboldt's work, an idea labeled as "terrestrial physics," something that scientists who preceded him, such as Linnaeus, failed to do. Humboldtian science is founded on a principle of "general equilibrium of forces." General equilibrium was the idea that there are infinite [[force]]s in nature that are in constant conflict, yet all forces balance each other out.
Humboldt laid the groundwork for future scientific endeavors by establishing the importance of studying organisms and their environment in conjunction .&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, Susan Faye. 1978. Science in culture: the early Victorian period. Kent, Eng:Dawon.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humboldtian science defined==

Humboldtian science includes both the extensive work of Alexander von Humboldt, as well as many of the works of 19th century scientists. [[Susan Cannon]] is attributed with coining the term ''Humboldtian science''.&lt;ref name="Nicolson p. 167"&gt;Nicolson, "Alexander von Humboldt, Humboldtian science, and the origins of the study of vegetation," p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cannon, Humboldtian science is, "the accurate, measured study of widespread but interconnected real phenomena in order to find a definite law and a dynamical cause."&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, ''Science in Culture'', p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldtian science is used now in place of the traditional, "Baconianism," as a more appropriate and less vague term for the themes of 19th century science.&lt;ref&gt;Jardine et al., ''Cultures of Natural History'', p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural history in the eighteenth century was the "nomination of the visible".&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson, Malcolm. 1987. "Alexander von Humboldt, Humboldtian science, and the origins of the study of vegetation." History of Science. 25: 169.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Linnaeus]] was preoccupied with fitting all nature into taxonomy, fixated on only what was visible. Towards the turn of the nineteenth century, Immanuel Kant became interested in understanding where species derived from, and was less concerned with an organism's physical attributes. Next, [[Johann Reinhold Forster]], one of Humboldt's future partners, became interested in the study of vegetation as an essential way of understanding nature and its relationship with human society. Proceeding Forster, Karl Willdenow examined floristic plant geography, the distribution of plants and regionality as a whole. All of these pieces in the history before Humboldt help to shape what is defined as Humboldtian science. Humboldt took into account both the outward appearance and inward meaning of plant species. His attention to natural aesthetics and empirical data and evidence is what set his scientific work apart from ecologists before him. Malcolm so aptly puts it as; "Humboldt effortlessly combined a commitment to empiricism and the experimental elucidation of the laws of nature with an equally strong commitment to holism and to a view of nature which was intended to be aesthetically and spiritually satisfactory".&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson, Malcolm. 1987. "Alexander von Humboldt, Humboldtian science, and the origins of the study of vegetation." History of Science. 25: 180.&lt;/ref&gt; It was through this holistic approach to science and the study of nature that Humboldt was able to find a web of interconnectedness despite a multitude of extensive differences between different species of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Home, Roderick Weir. 1995. "Humboldtian Science revisited: an Australian case study." History of Science. 33: 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Malcolm Nicholson, "Susan Cannon characterized Humboldtian science as synthetic, empirical, quantitative and impossible to fit into any one of our twentieth century disciplinary boundaries."&lt;ref name="Nicolson p. 167"/&gt; A central element of Humboldtian science was its use of the latest advances in scientific instrumentation to observe and measure physical variables, while attending to all possible sources of error. Humboldtian science revolved around understanding the relationship between accurate measurement, sources of error and mathematical laws.&lt;ref name="Jardine p. 288"/&gt; Cannon identifies four distinctive features that marked Humboldtian science out from previous versions of science:&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, ''Science in Culture'', p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;
* insistence on accuracy for all scientific instruments and observations;
* a mental sophistication in which theoretical mechanisms and entities of past science were taken lightly;
* a new set of conceptual tools, including isomaps, [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]], and a [[theory of errors]];
* the application of accuracy, mental sophistication, and tools not to isolated science in laboratories, but to greatly variable real phenomena.

==Humboldt's "terrestrial physicist"==
[[File:Borjomi_Kharaguli_National_Park_-_Georgia_%285%29.jpg|thumb|Scientific travelers depicted on Humboldt's (and Caspar David Friedrich's) role model]]

Humboldt was committed to what he called 'terrestrial physics.' Essentially Humboldt's new scientific approach required a new type of scientist: Humboldtian science demanded a transition from the naturalist to the physicist. Humboldt described how his idea of terrestrial physics differs from traditional "descriptive" natural history when he stated, "[traveling naturalists] have neglected to track the great and constant laws of nature manifested in the rapid flux of phenomena…and to trace the reciprocal interaction of the divided physical forces."&lt;ref name="Jardine p. 289"&gt;Jardine et al., ''Cultures of Natural History'', p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt did not consider himself an explorer, but rather a scientific traveler, who accurately measured what explorers had reported inaccurately.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, ''Science in Culture'', p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; According to Humboldt, the goal of the terrestrial physicist was to investigate the confluence and interweaving of all physical forces. An incredibly extensive array of precise instrumentation had to be readily available for Humboldt's terrestrial physicist. The expansive amount of scientific resources that characterized the Humboldtian scientist is best described in the book ''Science in Culture'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus the complete Humboldtian traveller, in order to make satisfactory observations, should be able to cope with everything from the revolution of the satellites of Jupiter to the carelessness of clumsy donkeys.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, ''Science in Culture'', p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Just some of such instruments included chronometers, telescopes, sextants, microscopes, magnetic compasses, thermometers, hygrometers, barometers, electrometers, and eudiometers. Furthermore, it was necessary to have multiple makes and models of each specific instrument to compare errors and constancy among each type.&lt;ref name="Jardine p. 289"/&gt;

==Humboldt's equilibrium==

One concept that is central to Humboldtian science is that of a general equilibrium of forces. Humboldt explains: "The general equilibrium which reigns amongst disturbances and apparent turmoil, is the result of infinite number of mechanical forces and chemical attractions balancing each other out."&lt;ref name="Jardine p. 290"&gt;Jardine et al., ''Cultures of Natural History'', p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Equilibrium is derived from an infinite number of forces acting simultaneously and varying globally. In other words, the lawfulness of nature, according to Humboldt, is a result of infinity and complexity. Humboldtian science promotes the idea that the more forces that are accurately measured over more of the earth's surface results in a greater understanding of the order of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Jardine et al., ''Cultures of Natural History'', p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

The voyage to the Americas produced many discoveries and developments that help to illustrate Humboldt's ideas about this equilibrium of forces. Humboldt produced the ''Tableau physique des Andes'' ("Physical Profile of the Andes), which aimed at capturing his voyage to the America's in a single graphic table. Humboldt meant to capture all of the physical forces, from organisms to electricity, in this single table. Among many other complex empirical recordings of elevation-specific data, the table included a detailed biodistribution.&lt;ref name="Jardine p. 290"/&gt; This biodistribution mapped the specific distributions of flora and fauna at every elevation level on the mountain.

Humboldt's study of plants provides an example of the movement of Humboldtian science away from traditional science. Humboldt's botany also further illustrates the concept of equilibrium and the Humboldtian ideas of the interrelationship of nature's elements. Although he was concerned with physical features of plants, he was largely focused on the investigation of underlying connections and relations among plant organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson, "Alexander von Humboldt, Humboldtian science, and the origins of the study of vegetation," p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt worked for years on developing an understanding of plant distributions and geography. The link between the balancing equilibrium of natural forces and organism distribution is evident when Humboldt states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As in all other phenomena of the physical universe, so in the distribution of organic beings: amidst the apparent disorder which seems to result from the influence of a multitude of local causes, the unchanging law of nature become evident as soon as one surveys an extensive territory, or uses a mass of facts in which the partial disturbances compensate one another.&lt;ref name="Jardine p. 298"&gt;Jardine et al., ''Cultures of Natural History'', p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The study of vegetation and plant geography arose out of new concerns that emerged with Humboldtian science. These new areas of concern in science included integrative processes, invisible connections, historical development, and natural wholes.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson, "Alexander von Humboldt, Humboldtian science, and the origins of the study of vegetation," p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Humboldtian science applied the idea of general equilibrium of forces to the continuities in the history of the generation of the planet. Humboldt saw the history of the earth as a continuous global distribution of such things as heat, vegetation, and rock formations. In order to graphically represent this continuity Humboldt developed isothermal lines.&lt;ref name="Jardine p. 295"&gt;Jardine et al., ''Cultures of Natural History'', p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; These isothermal lines functioned in the general balancing of forces in that isothermal lines preserved local peculiarities within a general regularity.&lt;ref name="Jardine p. 295"/&gt; According to Humboldtian science, nature's order and equilibrium emerged "gradually and progressively from laborious observing, averaging, and mapping over increasingly extended areas."&lt;ref name="Jardine p. 298"/&gt;

==Transformation of Humboldtian science==
[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] once dubbed Humboldt to be "one of those wonders of the world… who appear from time to time, as if to show us the possibilities of the human mind." &lt;ref&gt;Sachs, Aaron. The Humboldt Current. New York: Viking, 2008, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

When Humboldt first began his studies of organisms and the environment he claimed that he wanted to "reorganize the general connections that link organic beings and to study the great harmonies of Nature".&lt;ref name="Sachs, Aaron 2008, p.2"&gt;Sachs, Aaron. The Humboldt Current. New York: Viking, 2008, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; He is often considered one of the world's first genuine ecologists.&lt;ref name="Sachs, Aaron 2008, p.2"/&gt; Humboldt succeeded in developing a comprehensive science that joined the separate branches of natural philosophy under a model of natural order founded on the concept of dynamic equilibrium. Humboldt's work reached far beyond his personal expeditions and discoveries. Figures from all across the globe participated on his work. Some such participants included French naval officers, [[East India Company]] physicians, Russian provincial administrators, Spanish military commanders, and German diplomats. Furthermore, as was aforementioned, [[Charles Darwin]] carried a copy of Humboldt's ''Personal Narrative'' aboard H.M.S. Beagle.&lt;ref&gt;Jardine et al., ''Cultures of Natural History'', p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; Humboldt's projects, particularly those related to natural philosophy, played a significant role in the influx of European money and travelers to Spanish America in increasing numbers in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Jardine et al., ''Cultures of Natural History'', p. 301&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Sabine|Sir Edward Sabine]], a British scientist, worked on terrestrial magnetism in a manner that was certainly Humboldtian. Also, British scientist [[George Gabriel Stokes]] depended heavily on abstract mathematical measurement to deal with error in a precision instrument; certainly Humboldtian science. Maybe the most prominent figure whose work can be considered representative of Humboldtian science, is geologist [[Charles Lyell]]. Despite a lack of emphasis on precise measurement in geology at the time, Lyell insisted on precision in a Humboldtian manner.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, ''Science in Culture'', p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

The promotion and development of terrestrial physics under Humboldtian science produced not only useful maps and statistics, but offered both European and Creole societies tools for essentially 're-imaging' America.&lt;ref&gt;Jardine et al., ''Cultures of Natural History'', p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; The lasting impact of Humboldtian science is described in ''Cultures of Natural History'', "Humboldtian science illuminates the reorganization of knowledge and disciplines in the early nineteenth century that defined the emergence of natural history out of natural philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Jardine et al., ''Cultures of Natural History'', p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2059">'''Jumble ice''' is a phenomenon that occurs when ice atop a river or other flowing body of water fractures due to the different flow rates beneath the ice. On a lake, pond, or other stationary body of water, ice forms undisturbed and generally does not move as long as the entire surface of the body of water is frozen. When a river freezes, water flow typically continues beneath the ice, exerting pressure on it. If the ice fractures, pieces of ice torn free by the river's current will collide with stationary or slower-moving pieces. After becoming stuck in place, the loosened pieces of ice refreeze irregularly, causing a rough, or ''jumbled'', surface.

In general, the faster a body of water flows beneath ice, the more likely it is to develop jumble ice. Temperatures near the freezing point also tend to cause jumble ice, as the higher temperatures weaken the ice structure, allowing for more pieces to be torn free before refreezing. The [[Yukon River]] in [[Alaska]] often exhibits jumble ice during the winter.

Jumble ice is a hazard for winter travelers, as the broken "ground" formed by the jumble ice can cause [[snowmobile|snowmachine]] accidents or injuries to [[sled dog]]s.

'''Lacus Lenitatis''' ([[Latin]] for "Lake of Tenderness") is a small [[lunar mare]] in the [[Terra Nivium]] region on the [[Moon]]. It is located at 14.0° N, 12.0° E and is 80&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.  East is bordered with [[Lacus Hiemalis]], further north is [[Lacus Gaudii]], almost to the south is [[Mare Vaporum]].

No prominent craters are located in the lake but satellite craters such as Manilius U, W and X.

The '''Late Pleistocene''' is a [[Age (geology)|geochronological age]] of the [[Pleistocene]] [[epoch (geology)|Epoch]] and is associated with '''Upper Pleistocene''' (or '''Tarantian''') [[Stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] rocks. The beginning of the stage is defined by the base of the [[Eemian interglacial]] phase before the final glacial episode of the Pleistocene 126,000 ± 5,000 years ago. Its end is defined at the end of the [[Younger Dryas]], some  11,700 years ago.{{sfn|Walker|Johnsen|Rasmussen|Popp|2009|p=3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/majordivisions/|title=Major Divisions|date=4 January 2016|website=Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy|publisher=International Commission on Stratigraphy|access-date=25 January 2017}}.
For the top of the series, see: {{aut|Lourens, L., Hilgen, F., Shackleton, N.J., Laskar, J., Wilson, D.}}, (2004) "The Neogene Period". In: Gradstein, F., Ogg, J., Smith, A.G. (Eds.), ''A Geologic Time Scale 2004''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The age represents the end of the Pleistocene epoch and is followed by the [[Holocene]] epoch.

Much of the Late Pleistocene age was dominated by glaciations, such as the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] in [[North America]] and the [[Weichselian glaciation]] and [[Würm glaciation]] in [[Eurasia]]). Many [[megafauna]] became extinct during this age, a trend that continued into the Holocene. The Late Pleistocene contains the [[Upper Paleolithic]] stage of human development, including the [[Southern Dispersal|out-of-Africa]] migration and [[early human migrations|dispersal]] of [[anatomically modern humans]] and the extinction of the last remaining [[archaic human]] species.

==North America==

According to [[George Carr Frison]], ''[[Bison occidentalis]]'' and ''[[Bison antiquus]]'', an extinct subspecies of the smaller present-day bison, survived the Late Pleistocene period, between about 12 and 11 [[kiloannum|ka]] ago. Plains and Rocky Mountain First Nations depended on these bison as their major food source.{{sfn|Frison|2000}}&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;Frison noted that the "oldest, well-documented bison kills by pedestrian human hunters in North America date to about 11,000 years ago".&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier kills of camels, horses, and muskoxen found at [[Wally's beach]] were dated to 13.1–13.3 ka B.P.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Michael R.

Below is a '''listing of all known tornado emergencies issued in the [[United States]]''' to date.

'''Anti-nuclear power groups''' have emerged in every country that has had a [[nuclear power]] programme. [[Protest movement]]s against nuclear power first emerged in the USA, at the local level, and spread quickly to Europe and the rest of the world. National nuclear campaigns emerged in the late 1970s. Fuelled by the [[Three Mile Island accident]] and the [[Chernobyl disaster]], the anti-nuclear power movement mobilised political and economic forces which for some years "made nuclear energy untenable in many countries".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Rudig (1990). ''Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy'', Longman, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of these anti-nuclear power organisations are reported to have developed considerable expertise on nuclear power and [[energy dependence|energy issues]].&lt;ref name=schneider&gt;Lutz Mez, Mycle Schneider and Steve Thomas (Eds.) (2009). ''International Perspectives of Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power'', Multi-Science Publishing Co. Ltd, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the chairman of the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] said that "his agency had been pushed in the right direction on safety issues because of the pleas and protests of nuclear watchdog groups".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew L. Wald. [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/23/us/nuclear-agency-s-chief-praises-watchdog-groups.html?pagewanted=1 Nuclear Agency's Chief Praises Watchdog Groups], ''The New York Times'', June 23, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23016">The following is a '''list of [[tautonym]]s''': [[zoological]] names of species consisting of two identical words (the [[genus|generic name]] and the [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] have the same spelling). Such names are allowed in [[zoology]], but not in [[botany]], where the two parts of the name of a species must differ (though differences as small as one letter are permitted, as in the [[jujube]] (''Ziziphus zizyphus'')).

The '''Maar Museum''' ({{lang-de|Maarmuseum}}) in [[Manderscheid, Bitburg-Prüm|Manderscheid]] in the German state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] is a museum whose focus is natural variety and international significance for science and the region of the volcanic [[maar]]s that characterise parts of the [[Eifel]] mountains.

== Exhibition ==
The central theme of the exhibition is "the formation, history and development of the Eifel maars past and present". As a result, the maars are not just presented in isolation, but in the wider, international context. The reason for that is the specialist knowledge of many international scientists who take part in the development of the museum.

== Building ==
The building of the present museum was built in 1930 in the [[Expressionism (architecture)|Expressionist]]-influenced style of the [[Neues Bauen]] as a gymnastics and festival hall. It is a [[listed building]].

The Christianization of the [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] region began relatively early. While the episcopal seats from [[Byzantine]] times only remaining ruins, inhabited and used monasteries and churches are still present at this time at Olympus. Some of the monasteries are a stauropegion, ie they are directly subordinate to the Patriarch of [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]), others belong to a [[diocese]]. The number of churches and chapels around Mount Olympus is hard to overlook. That is why only the monasteries and most important churches are mentioned.

== History ==
On his journey from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Corinth]], in the first half of the 1st century, the [[apostle Paul]] also visited the northern Greek city of [[Thessaloniki]]. His 1st Letter to the Thessalonians is one of the oldest writings of [[Christendom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dibb.de/paulus-apostel.php|title=Paulus of Tharsus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul founded Christian communities, among others in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] and [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geschichtsverein-koengen.de/Christentum.htm|title=Christendom in the first century (in German)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century Dion became the first bishopric of the region.

== Byzantine ecclesiastical buildings ==
[[File:Teil eines Mosaiks, Louloudies.jpg|thumb|Part of a mosaic, Louloudies]][[File:Terrakottafliese Panagia, Kontaritissa Dion.jpg|thumb|Terracottatile of the church Panagia, Kontariotissa, with the inscription "Dion"]]
=== [[Archaeological Park of Dion|Dion]] ===
The basilica of the bishop was built in two phases. It was started in the 4th century. After being destroyed by an earthquake, it was completed in the 5th century. It was a three-nave church with [[narthex]]. A smaller building, west of the church, served as a [[baptistery]].

=== [[Louloudies]] ===
This fortress-like [[episcopal seat]] was built in the last quarter of the 5th century. It is probably the same place that was called Anamon in Roman records. In the middle of the 6th century, the buildings were destroyed by an earthquake. The bishop left the place and it was used in the subsequent period as a cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pieria-tourism.gr/louloudiesde.html|title=Louloudies, pieria-tourism.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Ancient Pydna|Pydna]] ===
Remains of two 4th-century and 6th-century basilicas were discovered at Pydna. The younger of the two basilicas was burned down by Bulgars after the conquest of Pydna. At the end of the 10th century, a 23 by 17 meters large basilica was built on their instead. In 1204, Frankish knights, probably after a siege, conquered the place and destroyed it. The remains of the basilica were turned into a fortress.

=== [[Kanalon Monastery|Monastery Kanalon]] ===
In 1055 the monks Joakim and Daniamos founded a monastery on the south side of Mount Olympus, located above the river Ziliana. The French archaeologist [[Leon Heuzey|Heuzey]] dated the founding of the monastery to the year 955.&lt;ref&gt;Léon Heuzey: ''Le mont Olympe et l'Acarnanie: exploration de ces deux régions, avec l étude de leurs antiquités, de leurs populations anciennes et modernes, de leur géographie et de leur histoire''. Ministère de l'Instruction publique au ministère de d'État, Paris 1860 [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k65306091 Online]&lt;/ref&gt; After the monks abandoned the monastery at the beginning of the 20th century, it is now inhabited by nuns.

=== Monastery Petra ===
In the 11th century, the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin (Isodion tis Theotoko) was built in Petra. Today there is a sanatorium in this place.

=== [[Agia Triada Sparmou Monastery|Monastery Agia Triada, Sparmos]] ===
At least since the year 1386 the existence of the monastery is documented. After being abandoned at the beginning of the 20th century, it has been inhabited by monks for several years now.

=== Church Panagia, Kontariotissa ===
The exact date of the construction of this church is unknown. The kind of the construction and the decoration inside the church point to the 7th century. It is interesting that obviously building material from the nearby Dion was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pieria-tourism.gr/byzantinede.html|title=Church of the holy Virgin, pieria-tourism.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-Byzantine ecclesiastical buildings ==
[[File:Panagia, Kontariotissa.jpg|thumb|Church of the holy virgin, Kontariotissa]]

=== [[Monastery Agios Dionysios]], Litochoro ===
In 1542 the monastery was founded by Saint Dionysius and dedicated to the Holy Trinity. During its history, the monastery was destroyed and rebuilt several times. In April 1943 it was blown up by the German Wehrmacht. The monks left the monastery and retreated to the [[Metochion|Metochi]] founded in 1650, which gradually became the new monastery of Agios Dionysios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imado.gr/monastery/index.php?lang=en|title=ST. DIONYSIOS OF OLYMPUS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Chapel of the Prophet Elias, Mount Olympus|Chapel of the Prophet Elias]] ===
The chapel was founded in the 16th century by Saint Dionysius, who probably lived there for a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imado.gr/monastery/index.php?lang=en|title=ST. DIONYSIOS OF OLYMPUS}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stands on the top of Mount Profitis Elias, one of the peaks of Olympus, at an altitude of 2803 meters. It is thus the highest chapel of the Orthodox Church at all. The chapel was built over ancient ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5862/|title=UNESCO, The broader region of Mount Olympus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monastery Klimadon ===
About 7 kilometers north of the town of Karya in 1640 the monastery of Agia Triada (Holy Trinity) was built. It was located at an altitude of 1320 meters and was also known by the name monastery Klymendou or simply as an old monastery (Palaiomonastirio). In 1823 it was partially burned down by the Ottomans, in 1833 one of the monks caused a fire that completely destroyed the monastery. Since 1913, a chapel stands at that place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympusfd.gr/us/Monastiria.asp|title=Olympus Nationalpark Management, Religious Tourism : MONASTERIES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monastery Agios Georgios, Ritini ===
Northeast of the town of Ritini lies the monastery of St. George. The oldest paintings of the monastery were dated to the year 1494. One of these frescoes shows St. George riding a dragon, another shows Jesus Christ on the cross. The other frescoes of the Katholikon date back to 1619. During World War II the monastery was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elatohori.com/index.php/ti-na-deite/agios-georgios|title=Monastery Agios Georgios (Μονή Αγίου Γεωργίου)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/11587582/The_katholicon_of_the_monastery_of_Agios_Georgios_Ritinis_in_Pieria._A_study_of_topography_architecture_and_monumental_painting|title=The katholicon of the monastery of Agios Georgios Ritinis in Pieria.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Church Agios Athanasios, Ano Skotina ===
At the northern end of the village of Ano Skotina is the church of Agios Athanasios. The main part of the church and the narthex dates back to 1656, the other parts of the building were added later. The church is known for its frescoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dion-olympos.com/index.php/styles/palia-skotina|title=Palia Skotina, Municipality Dion-Olympus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kaliampos-ioannis-skotina.blogspot.gr/2015/10/blog-post_8.html|title=Prof. Joannnis Kaliambos, Skotina Pierias}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern ecclesiastical buildings ==

=== [[Monastery Ephraim]], Kontariotissa ===
The monastery is located on a hill, 1.5 kilometers north of Kontariotissa. The foundation was in 1983, the nuns inhabited monastery is under the diocese of Kitros-Katerini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imociosefraimsyr.gr|title=Homepage of the monastery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monastery to the Holy Virgin, Rapsani ===
The convent to the Blessed Virgin located east of Rapsani was founded in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monastiria.gr/thessalia/nomos-larisas/iera-moni-panagias-glykofilousas-rapsanis/|title=The Greek monasteries (Μοναστήρια της Ελλάδας)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2006">'''Morgens''', '''morgans''', or '''mari-morgans''' are [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]] and [[Breton mythology|Breton]] [[water deity|water spirits]] that drown men. They may lure men to their death by their own sylphic beauty, or with glimpses of underwater gardens with buildings of gold or crystal. They are also blamed for heavy flooding that destroys crops or villages. In the story of the drowning of [[Ys]], a city in [[Brittany]], the king's daughter [[Dahut]] is the cause, and she becomes a sea morgen.

The morgens are eternally young, and like [[Siren (mythology)|siren]]s they sit in the water and comb their hair [[seductively]].&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Anna  (2002) ''The Illustrated Encyclopaedia Of Fairies'' Vega, London, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Matter of Britain|Arthurian legend]], particularly [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Vita Merlini]]'', the ruler of [[Avalon]] is referred to as "Morgen".&lt;ref&gt;Rhys, John (1891) ''Studies in the Arthurian Legend'' Clarendon Press, Oxford, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the origin of [[Morgan le Fay]] may be connected to these [[Breton mythology|Breton myths]].&lt;ref&gt;Sykes, Egerton and Kendall, Alan (2002 ed.)

The '''Mount Cayley massif''' is a group of [[mountain]]s in the [[Pacific Ranges]] of southwestern [[British Columbia]], Canada. Located {{nowrap|{{Convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}}}} north of [[Squamish, British Columbia|Squamish]] and {{nowrap|{{Convert|24|km|mi|abbr=on}}}} west of [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]], the [[massif]] resides on the edge of the [[Powder Mountain Icefield]]. It consists of an eroded but potentially active [[stratovolcano]] that towers over the [[Cheakamus River|Cheakamus]] and [[Squamish River|Squamish]] [[river valley]]s. All major summits have elevations greater than {{nowrap|{{Convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}}}, [[Mount Cayley]] being the highest at {{nowrap|{{Convert|2385|m|ft|abbr=on}}}}. The surrounding area has been inhabited by [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] for more than 7,000&amp;nbsp;years while [[geothermal exploration]] has taken place there for the last four decades.

Part of the [[Garibaldi Volcanic Belt]], the Mount Cayley massif was formed by [[subduction zone]] [[volcanism]] along the western margin of North America. Eruptive activity began about 4,000,000&amp;nbsp;years ago and has since undergone three stages of growth, the first two of which built most of the massif. The latest eruptive period occurred sometime in the last 400,000&amp;nbsp;years with lesser activity continuing into the present day.

Future eruptions are likely to threaten neighbouring communities with [[pyroclastic flow]]s, [[lahar]]s (volcanically induced [[mudslide]]s, [[landslide]]s and [[debris flow]]s) and floods. To monitor this threat, the volcano and its surroundings are monitored by the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] (GSC). Eruption impact would be largely a result of the concentration of vulnerable infrastructure in nearby valleys.

==Geography and geology==
The massif resides in the middle of a north–south trending zone of volcanism called the [[Mount Cayley volcanic field]].&lt;ref name="GVP"&gt;{{cite gvp|vn=320811|title=Cayley Volcanic Field|accessdate=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists predominantly of volcanoes that formed [[subglacial volcano|subglacially]] during the [[Late Pleistocene]] [[age (geology)|age]], such as [[Pali Dome]], [[Slag Hill]], [[Ring Mountain (British Columbia)|Ring Mountain]] and [[Ember Ridge]], but activity continued at Pali Dome and Slag Hill into the [[Holocene]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]]. The Mount Cayley volcanic field is part of the [[Garibaldi Volcanic Belt]], which in turn represents a northern extension of the [[Cascade Volcanic Arc]].&lt;ref name="GVP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KW"&gt;Kelman, M. C., Russell, J. K., Hickson, C. J. (2001). "Preliminary petrography and chemistry of the Mount Cayley volcanic field, British Columbia", ''Current Research Part A'', [[Geological Survey of Canada]] Paper 2001-A11, pp. 1, 2, 4, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Volcanism of the Cascade Arc is largely a result of the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] sliding under the [[North American Plate]] at the [[Cascadia subduction zone]].&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Charles A.|last2=Kienle|first2=Jürgen|pages=112, 113, 142, 148|title=Volcanoes of North America: United States and Canada|year=2001|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=[[Cambridge]], England|isbn=0-521-43811-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three main summits comprise the Mount Cayley massif.&lt;ref name="GDK"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hildreth|first=Wes|title=Quaternary Magmatism in the Cascades—Geologic Perspectives|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|pages=7, 8, 10, 11, 67|year=2007|isbn=1-4113-1945-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest and northernmost is Mount Cayley with an elevation of {{nowrap|{{Convert|2385|m|ft|abbr=on}}}}.&lt;ref name="BX"&gt;{{cite thesis|type=PhD|last=Kelman|first=Melanie Catherine|title=Glaciovolcanism at the Mount Cayley volcanic field, Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, southwestern British Columbia|date=2005|publisher=[[University of British Columbia]]|pages=4, 21, 24, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its northeastern flank abuts the southern end of the Powder Mountain Icefield.&lt;ref name="GDK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BX"/&gt; This is a {{nowrap|{{Convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}}}} long and {{nowrap|{{Convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}}}} wide irregularly-shaped glacier that trends slightly to the northwest.&lt;ref name="BX"/&gt; Just southwest of Mount Cayley lies [[Pyroclastic Peak]], {{nowrap|{{Convert|2341|m|ft|abbr=on}}}} in elevation. It contains a jagged summit ridge of many slender [[rock pinnacle]]s, the largest of which is known as the [[Vulcan's Thumb]].&lt;ref name="KW"/&gt; Wizard Peak with an elevation of {{nowrap|{{Convert|2240|m|ft|abbr=on}}}} is east of Pyroclastic Peak and is the lowest of the three main summits.&lt;ref name="BX"/&gt;

As a stratovolcano, the Mount Cayley massif is built up of solidified lava and ash from successive volcanic eruptions. It is predominantly [[dacitic]] in composition, although [[rhyodacite]] is also common. Its original and current volumes remain uncertain.&lt;ref name="GDK"/&gt; It may have had a volume as large as {{nowrap|{{Convert|13|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}}}, but erosion has since reduced it to glacially eroded crags. The modern volcano has an estimated volume of {{nowrap|{{Convert|8|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}}} and is only a modest fraction of its total output of silicic eruptive products. It has a proximal relief of {{nowrap|{{Convert|550|m|ft|abbr=on}}}} and a draping relief of {{nowrap|{{Convert|2070|m|ft|abbr=on}}}}, with a nearly vertical cliff more than {{nowrap|{{Convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}}}} high immediately above the Turbid Creek valley.&lt;ref name="GDK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BX"/&gt;{{Ref|art1|[a]}} Turbid Creek, Dusty Creek, Avalanche Creek and Shovelnose Creek flow from the slopes of the Mount Cayley massif.&lt;ref name="BX"/&gt;&lt;ref name="QJ"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cruden|first=D. M.|last2=Lu|first2=Z. Y.|title=The rockslide and debris flow from Mount Cayley, B.C., in June 1984|journal=[[Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences]]|volume=29|page=614|publisher=[[NRC Research Press]]|year=1992|issn=1480-3313|doi=10.1139/t92-069}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GD"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clague|first=J.

Deep seismic profiling {{nowrap|{{Convert|12.5|to|13|km|mi|abbr=on}}}} below the massif has identified a large [[bright spot]], a [[reflection seismology|reflector]] interpreted to be a mid-[[crust (geology)|crustal]] [[magma chamber]] or body of very hot rock.&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;{{cite thesis|type=MAS|last=Kimball|first=Sarah|title=Favourability Map of British Columbia Geothermal Resources|publisher=[[University of British Columbia]]|pages=21, 22, 24, 131|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WY"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hammer|first=Philip|last2=Clowes|first2=Ron|title=Seismic reflection investigations of the Mount Cayley bright spot: A midcrustal reflector beneath the Coast Mountains, British Columbia|journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|publisher=[[American Geophysical Union]]|page=20119|volume=101|issue=B9|year=1996|issn=0148-0227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar mid-crustal reflectors have been identified under subduction zone volcanoes in Japan.&lt;ref name="WY"/&gt;

==Volcanic history==
The Mount Cayley massif has experienced volcanic eruptions sporadically for the last 4,000,000&amp;nbsp;years, making it one of the most persistent eruptive centres in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt.&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt; Three primary eruptive stages in the history of the massif have been identified.&lt;ref name="BX"/&gt; The Mount Cayley and Vulcan's Thumb stages occurred between 4,000,000&amp;nbsp;and 600,000&amp;nbsp;years ago with the construction of the stratovolcano and [[plug dome]]s. A 300,000-year-long period of quiescence followed, during which prolonged erosion destroyed much of the original volcanic structure. This was followed by the third and final Shovelnose stage about 300,000&amp;nbsp;to 200,000&amp;nbsp;years ago with the emplacement of parasitic lava domes and flows.&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt; Although one of the Shovelnose domes has been [[K–Ar dating|potassium-argon dated]] at 310,000&amp;nbsp;years old, this date may be in error from excess [[argon]].&lt;ref name="GDK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BX"/&gt; The Shovelnose stage rocks could be much younger, perhaps less than 15,000&amp;nbsp;years old.&lt;ref name="GDK"/&gt;

Eruptions during the three stages produced [[volcanic rock]]s of [[felsic]] and [[intermediate composition|intermediate]] compositions, including [[andesite]], dacite and rhyodacite.&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt; The lack of evidence for [[glaciovolcanism|volcano-ice interactions]] at the Mount Cayley massif implies that all eruptive stages most likely took place prior to [[glacial period]]s. This contrasts with many neighbouring volcanoes, which contain abundant [[volcanic glass]] and fine-scale [[columnar jointing]] from contact with ice during eruptions.&lt;ref name="KW"/&gt;

Initial volcanic activity of the Mount Cayley massif 4,000,000&amp;nbsp;years ago corresponded with changes to the regional [[plate tectonics]].&lt;ref name="NG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FI"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cenozoic to Recent plate configurations in the Pacific Basin: Ridge subduction and slab window magmatism in western North America|last=Madsen|first=J. K.|last2=Thorkelson|first2=D. J.|last3=Friedman|first3=R. M.|last4=Marshall|first4=D. D.|publisher=[[Geological Society of America]]|pages=30, 31|volume=2|issue=1|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This involved the separation of the [[Explorer Plate|Explorer]] and [[Juan de Fuca Plate|Juan de Fuca]] plates off the [[British Columbia Coast]], which had some significant ramifications for regional geologic evolution. After this reorganization ceased, volcanism shifted westward from the [[Pemberton Volcanic Belt]] to establish the younger and currently active Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. The westward shift in volcanism may have been related to steepening of the Juan de Fuca [[slab (geology)|slab]] after the formation of the Explorer Plate.&lt;ref name="FI"/&gt;

===Mount Cayley stage===
[[File:Mount Cayley.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Mount Cayley viewed from southeast showing light coloured breccia cut by a central spine of dacite which forms the summit ridge.]]
The early Mount Cayley stage was characterized by the eruption of felsic lava flows and [[pyroclastic rock]]s onto a [[Basement (geology)|crystalline basement]].&lt;ref name="BX"/&gt;&lt;ref name="QB"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=S. G.|last2=Brooks|first2=G. R.|title=Prehistoric debris avalanches from Mount Cayley volcano, British Columbia|journal=[[Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences]]|volume=28|pages=1365, 1368, 1370, 1371|publisher=[[NRC Research Press]]|year=1991|issn=1480-3313|doi=10.1139/e91-120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial volcanism formed a southwesterly-[[strike and dip|dipping]] prism of dacite flows and [[tephra]] cut by several [[dike (geology)|dikes]] and [[sill (geology)|sills]]. These rocks have been [[Metasomatism|hydrothermally altered]] to varying degrees and are light yellow or red in colour. They are well exposed in the prominent southwestern cliffs of the massif.&lt;ref name="BX"/&gt;

Subsequent activity deposited a series of massive dacite flows up to {{nowrap|{{Convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}}}} thick, which form the summit and northern slope of Wizard Peak. The Mount Cayley stage culminated with the emplacement of a central plug dome that forms the narrow jagged summit ridge of Mount Cayley. This edifice consists of similar [[Intrusive rock|intrusive]] dacite.&lt;ref name="BX"/&gt;

===Vulcan's Thumb stage===
The next eruptive period, the Vulcan's Thumb stage, built an edifice that grew upon the southwestern slope of the ancestral Mount Cayley stratovolcano. This began with the eruption of massive dacite flows and blocky agglutinated [[breccia]]s onto basement and older volcanic rocks of the Mount Cayley stage. These rocks partially form a ridge south of Wizard Peak and comprise the prominent summit ridge pinnacles of Pyroclastic Peak, including the Vulcan's Thumb.&lt;ref name="BX"/&gt;

Later activity produced an overlying {{nowrap|{{Convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}}}} wide and {{nowrap|{{Convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}}}} long southwest-trending lobe of unconsolidated or poorly consolidated tephra. The tephra consists of ash and [[lapilli]]-sized fragments that have been heavily eroded to form vertical cliffs and ridges. Volcanism also deposited a {{nowrap|{{Convert|130|m|ft|abbr=on}}}} thick sequence of blocky dacitic [[tuff]] breccia between Wizard Peak and Mount Cayley.&lt;ref name="BX"/&gt;

===Shovelnose stage===
Volcanic activity of the final Shovelnose stage involved the eruption of two lava domes at the east and southeast margins of the Mount Cayley massif in the upper Shovelnose Creek valley.&lt;ref name="BX"/&gt; The southeast dacite dome forms {{nowrap|{{Convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}}}} high cliffs of small diameter columnar joints.&lt;ref name="BX"/&gt; It was the source of a {{nowrap|{{Convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}}}} long dacite flow that extends down the Shovelnose and Turbid creek valleys to near the Squamish River.&lt;ref name="GDK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BX"/&gt; The east lava dome was built upon blocky bedded tephra overlying basement rocks and consists of a steep-sided columnar jointed mass of dacite.&lt;ref name="BX"/&gt;

===Recent activity===
Although the Mount Cayley massif is not known to have had historical volcanic eruptions, low-level activity has continued into [[recorded history]]. Shallow [[earthquake]]s have occurred in the vicinity since 1985 and the Shovelnose and Turbid creek valleys contain two and three [[hot spring]]s, respectively. The GSC therefore considers the massif a potentially active volcano.&lt;ref name="QKL"&gt;{{cite |last=Southam|first=Dave|title=Preliminary Debris Flow Assessment – June 29, 2014 Mud Creek Event Squamish River (9160), Approximate Station 21.1 km|publisher=Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations|pages=1, 4, 8|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures ranging from {{nowrap|{{Convert|18|to|40|C|F|abbr=on}}}} have been measured from the hot springs.&lt;ref name="BX"/&gt; 

The existence of hot springs indicate that [[magma]]tic heat is still present. Extensive [[tufa]] and [[sinter (geology)|sinter]] deposits inhabit the main hot springs while bright red ferruginous [[ochre]] precipitates from several cold seeps in the vicinity. The springs are confined around dacite [[cupola (geology)|cupolas]] and dikes that were emplaced during the Vulcan's Thumb stage.&lt;ref name="BX"/&gt;

[[File:Mount Cayley massif pano.jpg|thumb|center|500px|Panoramic view of the Mount Cayley massif with Pyroclastic Peak on the left and Mount Cayley in the middle. View is westward {{nowrap|{{Convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}}}} from [[Whistler Mountain]].]]

==Landslide history==
Because the Mount Cayley massif is rich in coarse proximal pyroclastic deposits, some of them hydrothermally altered, it is especially prone to slope failure and [[debris avalanche]]s.&lt;ref name="GDK"/&gt; At least three major debris avalanches have occurred from the western slope in the last 10,000&amp;nbsp;years, all of which blocked the Squamish River and formed temporary lakes upstream. The first and largest event about 4,800&amp;nbsp;years ago produced a {{nowrap|{{Convert|200000000|to|300000000|m3|ft3|abbr=on}}}} debris fan exposed along the Squamish River. A {{nowrap|{{Convert|0.5|to|40|cm|in|abbr=on}}}} thick sequence of [[silt]]s, sands and pebbles interbedded in the debris fan suggests that it may be the product of two major, closely spaced, debris avalanches rather than a single event. Another large debris avalanche about 1,100&amp;nbsp;years ago deposited material immediately upstream of the mouth of Turbid Creek. The third event followed about 500&amp;nbsp;years ago with the deposition of two [[diamicton]] units along Turbid Creek and was the smallest of the three major prehistoric debris avalanches. A lack of organic and [[paleosol]] [[horizon (geology)|horizons]] between the two units implies that they most likely represent separate surges within the same debris avalanche event.&lt;ref name="QB"/&gt;

At least three smaller scale debris avalanches have occurred in historic time. A {{nowrap|{{Convert|5000000|m3|ft3|abbr=on}}}} landslide occurred in 1963 with the failure of a large [[volcanic block]] consisting of poorly consolidated tuff breccia and columnar-jointed dacite. The mass slid into Dusty Creek where it quickly fragmented into an [[aggregate (geology)|aggregate]] then travelled roughly {{nowrap|{{Convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}}}} downstream where it entered the broader flatter valley of Turbid Creek for an additional {{nowrap|{{Convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}}}}. Both creeks were blocked by the event, resulting in the creation of lakes that eventually overtopped and breached the [[landslide dam]] to produce floods and possibly debris flows which in turn swept down Turbid Creek far beyond the landslide terminus.&lt;ref name="GD"/&gt; In June 1984, a major rockslide and debris flow resulted from a {{nowrap|{{Convert|3200000|m3|ft3|abbr=on}}}} collapse at the head of Avalanche Creek. The debris flow reached the mouth of Turbid Creek where it destroyed a logging road bridge and blocked the Squamish River, introducing massive quantities of sediment.&lt;ref name="QJ"/&gt; The third event took place along Turbid Creek in June 2014 and involved a debris flow that removed part of the Squamish River Forest Service Road.&lt;ref name="QKL"/&gt;

==Human history==
The area has been inhabited by [[First Nations]] for thousands of years. Both the Mount Cayley massif and [[The Black Tusk]] on the opposite side of the Cheakamus River valley are called ''ta&lt;u&gt;k&lt;/u&gt;'ta&lt;u&gt;k&lt;/u&gt;mu'yin tl'a in7in'axa7en'' by the [[Squamish people]]. In their [[Squamish language|language]] it means "Landing Place of the Thunderbird".&lt;ref name="SQU"&gt;{{cite paper|last=Reimer|first=Rudy|title=Squamish Traditional Use of Nch’kay Or the Mount Garibaldi and Brohm Ridge Area|publisher=First Heritage Archaeological Consulting|pages=8, 17|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]] is a [[legendary creature]] in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|North American indigenous peoples']] history and culture.&lt;ref name="GHJ"&gt;{{cite paper|first=Rudy |last=Reimer/Yum&lt;u&gt;k&lt;/u&gt;s|title=Squamish Nation Cognitive Landscapes|pages=8, 9|publisher=[[McMaster University]]|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the bird flaps its wings, thunder is created, and lightning originates from its eyes. The Mount Cayley massif and The Black Tusk are considered sacred to the Squamish people as they have played an important part of their [[History of the Squamish people|history]]. [[Vaccinium membranaceum|Mountain bilberries]], [[Vaccinium myrtilloides|Canadian blueberries]] and [[Vaccinium ovalifolium|oval-leaved blueberries]], being a favored food of the Squamish people, were gathered in large berry fields on and near the massif.&lt;ref name="SQU"/&gt; Glassy rhyodacite collected from small [[outcrop]]s on the slopes have been found in goat hunting sites and the Elaho rockshelter which have been collectively dated around 8,000&amp;nbsp;to 100&amp;nbsp;years old. Cayley rhyodacite has only been found in the northern parts of the [[Squamish Nation]] territory.&lt;ref name="GHJ"/&gt;

[[File:Mount Cayley southwest.jpg|thumb|left|The Mount Cayley massif as seen from the southwest]]
There had been no [[first ascent]] of the massif until July 1928 when an [[Alpine Club of Canada]] party, consisting of [[mountaineers]] R. E. Knight, W. G. Wheatley, E. C. Brooks, T. Fyles and B. Clegg, climbed Mount Cayley. Fyles submitted the mountain name to the [[Government of British Columbia]] in September 1928 for Beverley Cochrane Cayley, a mountaineer and friend of those in the climbing expedition who had died in June that year. The name became official on April 2, 1929, and photographs of the peak were published with Fyles' description of first ascent in the 1931 [[Canadian Alpine Journal]] Vol XX.&lt;ref&gt;{{BCGNIS|id=3467|name=Mount Cayley|accessdate=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mount Cayley massif has been investigated as a potential [[geothermal energy]] resource since at least the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="KJ"&gt;{{cite report|last=Jessop|first=A.|title=Review of National Geothermal Energy Program Phase 2 – Geothermal Potential of the Cordillera|work=Mount Cayley|publisher=[[Geological Survey of Canada]]|page=45|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geothermal exploration by [[Energy, Mines and Resources Canada]] commenced in 1977 with the drilling of two shallow boreholes on the west side of the massif for temperature observation.&lt;ref name="KJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ZG"&gt;{{cite report|last=Reader|first=John F.|last2=Croft|first2=Stuart A. S.|title=Report on 1982 Temperature Gradient Drilling on Shovelnose Creek at Mount Cayley, Southwestern British Columbia|publisher=Nevin Sadier-Brown Goodbrand Limited|page=3|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; High [[geothermal gradient]]s of&amp;nbsp;51 and 65&amp;nbsp;[[millikelvin]] per metre were obtained from this work.&lt;ref name="KJ"/&gt; Further drilling on the east and west sides of the massif in 1980–1982 by Nevin Sadlier-Brown Goodbrand Limited on behalf of the GSC showed geothermal gradients ranging from 45 to 95 millikelvin per metre.&lt;ref name="KJ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ZG"/&gt; In 2002, [[BC Hydro]] published a report identifying&amp;nbsp;16 prospective geothermal sites throughout British Columbia. They named the Mount Cayley massif as one of the six sites with the highest potential for commercial development. There is "promising" potential for a 100&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt]] geothermal power station at the volcano but the severe terrain makes development difficult and expensive.

Though the Mount Cayley massif is currently quiet, it still poses potential hazards to nearby towns as well as logging and recreational areas.&lt;ref name="BX"/&gt; GSC seismic data suggest that the volcano still contains magma, indicating possible future eruptive activity and associated [[volcanic hazards]] such as landslides.&lt;ref name="QKL"/&gt; An eruption scenario for the volcano was organized by GSC scientists in 2000 to show how [[Western Canada]] is vulnerable to such an event. They based the scenario on past activity in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and involved both [[explosive eruption|explosive]] and [[effusive eruption|effusive]] activity. The scenario was published in 2003 as an article for ''Natural Hazards'', a [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] journal devoting on all aspects of [[natural hazard]]s including risk management and the forecasting of catastrophic events.&lt;ref name="GSC"&gt;{{cite |last=V. Stasiuk|first=Mark|last2=J. Hickson|first2=Catherine|last3=Mulder|first3=Taimi|journal=Natural Hazards|title=The Vulnerability of Canada to Volcanic Hazards|publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]]|volume=28|pages=563, 579, 580, 581, 582|year=2003|issn=0921-030X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If eruptive activity were to resume, scientists would likely be able to detect increased [[seismicity]] as magma makes its way through the crust. The abundance of seismic activity and the sensitivity of the existing [[Canadian National Seismograph Network]] in this area would alert the GSC and possibly trigger an expanded [[Prediction of volcanic activity|monitoring]] effort. As the magma nears the surface, the volcano would likely swell and the surface fracture, causing greatly increased vigour in the hot springs and the creation of new springs or [[fumarole]]s. Minor and possibly large landslides could occur and might temporarily block the Squamish River, as has happened in the past without earthquake shaking and intrusion-related deformation. Eventually the near-surface magma may cause [[phreatic eruption|phreatic explosions]] and debris flows. By this time [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] would be closed, Squamish would be evacuated and Whistler would be at least considered for evacuation.&lt;ref name="GSC"/&gt;

The Mount Cayley massif is on the upper left slope of the mountain ridge between the two valleys. Squamish is in the bottom right corner of image.]]
In the event of an explosive eruption, an [[ash plume]] could reach {{nowrap|{{Convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}}} in height and may be maintained for 12&amp;nbsp;hours. Air traffic would be diverted from the area and all airports covered by the plume would be closed, notably those in [[Vancouver]], [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Kamloops]], [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]] and [[Seattle]]. Above the vent area, material from the eruption plume would collapse to form pyroclastic flows and would flow east and west into the Squamish and Cheakamus valleys. These would rapidly melt snow and ice in the summit area, generating debris flows that could reach Squamish and [[Daisy Lake (British Columbia)|Daisy Lake]], damaging much infrastructure. Heavy [[pyroclastic fall|ash fall]]s would occur in the Vancouver area, the [[Fraser Valley]], [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], Kamloops, Whistler and [[Pemberton, British Columbia|Pemberton]]. The ash would damage power and communication lines and satellite dishes, as well as computer and other electrical equipment. Telephone, radio, cell phone and satellite communications would be cut off. Weak structures could collapse under the weight of the ash. The eruption plume would then spread to envelop most of the west coast from Seattle to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], causing all enclosed airports to be closed and all relevant flights to be diverted or cancelled. Eastward migration of the plume would disrupt air traffic across Canada from [[Alberta]] to [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. Ash from further, minor explosive activity could continue to fall lightly but persistently in the Whistler–Pemberton area, followed by weeks of viscous lava dome growth punctuated by small explosions. The explosions would generate short-lived {{nowrap|{{Convert|10|to|15|km|mi|abbr=on}}}} high plumes, small pyroclastic flows to the Squamish and Cheakamus valleys and ash plumes to the north and east.&lt;ref name="GSC"/&gt;

Explosions might cease and be replaced by slow, continuous growth of a lava dome in the new [[volcanic crater|crater]]. Rain and seasonal snow melt would regularly remobilize the tephra into lahars and these would continue to threaten the Squamish and Cheakamus valleys. The solidifying, spreading lava could then generate rockfalls and form a voluminous [[scree|talus]] apron into the Squamish valley. As the lava dome spreads, it would periodically undergo gravitational collapse to generate dense pyroclastic flows into the Squamish and Cheakamus valleys. Ash elutriated from the pyroclastic flows would form plumes up to {{nowrap|{{Convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}}}} high, again dropping ash onto Pemberton and Whistler and causing disruptions to local air traffic. Infrequently, the lava dome might produce small explosions, ash plumes and pyroclastic flows. Squamish would remain evacuated, Highway 99 would remain closed and unrepairable and travel between Whistler/Pemberton and Vancouver would be forced to go via a much longer route to the east.&lt;ref name="GSC"/&gt;

Eruptive activity itself could go on for years, followed by years of declining secondary activity. The cooling lava would intermittently spall sections to produce pyroclastic flows. The fragmental material on the slopes and in valleys would be periodically remobilized into debris flows. Significant structural mitigation would have to be built to reclaim use of the [[Sea-to-Sky Corridor|Highway 99 corridor]] and Squamish area.&lt;ref name="GSC"/&gt;

{{Other uses}}
{{lowercase title}}
The abbreviation '''myr''', "million years", is a [[unit of measurement|unit]] of a quantity of {{val|fmt=commas|1000000}} (i.e. {{val|1|e=6}}) years, or 31.6 [[Terasecond and longer#Teraseconds|teraseconds]].

==Usage==
Myr is in common use where the term is often written, such as in [[Earth science]] and [[cosmology]]. Myr is seen with ''mya'', "million years ago".  Together they make a reference system, one to a quantity, the other to a particular place in a [[calendar era|year numbering system]] that is ''time before the present''.

Myr is deprecated in [[geology]], but in [[astronomy]] ''myr'' is standard.
Where "myr" ''is'' seen in geology it is usually "Myr" (a unit of mega-years).  In astronomy it is usually "MYR" (million years).

== Debate ==
In geology the debate of the millennia concerns the use of ''myr'' remains open concerning "the use of ''Myr'' plus ''Mya''" versus "using ''Mya'' only".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mozley|first=Peter|title=Discussion of GSA Time Unit Conventions|url=http://www.geosociety.org/TimeUnits/|work=web page|publisher=[[Geological Society of America]]|accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In either case the term ''[[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]'' is used in geology literature conforming to [[ISO 31-1]] (now [[ISO 80000-3]]) and NIST 811 recommended practices. Traditional style geology literature is written {{Quote|The Cretaceous started 145 Ma and ended 66 Ma, lasting for 79 Myr.}}
The "ago" is implied, so that any such year number "X Ma" between 66 and 145 is "Cretaceous", for good reason. But the counter argument is that having ''myr'' for a duration and ''Mya'' for an age mixes unit systems, and tempts capitalization errors: "million" need not be capitalized, but "mega" must be; "ma" would technically imply a ''milliyear'' (a thousandth of a year, or 8 hours). On this side of the debate, one avoids ''myr'' and simply adds ''ago'' explicitly (or adds ''[[Before Present|BP]]''), as in {{Quote|The Cretaceous started 145 Ma ago and ended 66 Ma ago, lasting for 79 Ma.}}
In this case, "79 Ma" means only a quantity of 79 million years, without the meaning of "79 million years ago".

'''Nagbahal''' is located {{coord|27.676013|N|85.324185|E}} at the heart of the city of [[Patan, Lalitpur|Lalitpur]] in [[Kathmandu Valley]], in [[Nepal]]. Around 5000 people live in the Nagbahal community, mainly from [[Newar]] ethnic groups. The history of the Nagbahal and the neighbouring Hiranya Varna Mahavihar (also popularly known as the Golden Temple) goes back to the 11th century. 
Almost all of the residents of this beautiful courtyard are Buddhists and are affiliated to the "Sangha" of the Hiranya Varna Mahavihar. The main shrine of the courtyard is located at the center inside a lone-standing two-storey building with tile roof.[[File:Hiranaya varna Mahavihar, Patan, Lalitpur.jpg|thumb|Hiranya Varna Mahavihar,also known as Golden Temple]]
Another important feature of Nagbahal is a water spout dating back to the ancient history of Nepal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacesnepal.com/archives/nov_dec08/nagbahal_hiti.htm|title=Preserving the Nagbahal Hiti|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326110807/http://www.spacesnepal.com/archives/nov_dec08/nagbahal_hiti.htm|archivedate=2012-03-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which clearly suggests that the area was already inhabited well before the 1st century AD.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
[[File:Stone Spout (hiti) at Nag Bahal 05.jpg|thumb]]
The [[Dhakhwa]] family is one of the most renowned noble families who have been dwelling in Nagbahal since ancient times. Along with the Dhakhwas there are other families: Shakya, Joshi, Bajracharya, Maharjan, and Napit.

'''Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking''' ('''NEAT''') was a program run by [[NASA]] and the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], [[Astronomical survey|surveying the sky]] for [[near-Earth object]]s. NEAT was conducted from December 1995 until April 2007, at [[Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance|GEODSS]] on Hawaii (Haleakala-NEAT; [[IAU code#566|566]]), as well as at [[Palomar Observatory]] in California (Palomar-NEAT; [[IAU code#644|644]]). With the [[List of minor planet discoverers#Discovering dedicated institutions|discovery]] of more than 40 thousand [[minor planet]]s, NEAT has been one of the most successful programs in this field, comparable to the [[Catalina Sky Survey]], [[LONEOS]] and [[Mount Lemmon Survey]].&lt;ref name="NEAT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bauer-2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-Discoverers" /&gt;

NEAT was the successor to the [[Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey]] (PCAS).

The original principal investigator was [[Eleanor F. Helin]], with co-investigators Steven H. Pravdo and [[David L. Rabinowitz]].&lt;ref name="NEAT" /&gt;

NEAT has a cooperative agreement with the [[U.S. Air Force]] to use a [[GEODSS]] telescope located on [[Haleakala]], [[Maui]], [[Hawaii]]. GEODSS stands for [[Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance]] and these wide field Air Force telescopes were designed to optically observe Earth orbital spacecraft. The NEAT team designed a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] camera and computer system for the GEODSS telescope. The CCD camera format is 4096&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;4096 [[pixel]]s and the field of view is 1.2°&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;1.6°.

Beginning in April 2001, the [[Samuel Oschin telescope]] ({{convert|1.2|m}} aperture Schmidt telescope at [[Palomar Observatory]]) was also put into service to discover and track near-Earth objects. This telescope is equipped with a camera containing 112 CCDs each 2400&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;600. This is the telescope that produced the images leading to the discovery of [[50000 Quaoar]] in 2002, and [[90377 Sedna]] in 2003 (published 2004) and the [[dwarf planet]] [[136199 Eris|Eris]].

In addition to discovering thousands of [[asteroid]]s, NEAT is also credited with the co-discovery (recovery) of periodic [[comet]] [[54P/de Vico-Swift-NEAT]] and of the high proper motion [[Teegarden's star]]. The [[C/2001 Q4 (NEAT)]] comet was discovered on August 24, 2001 by NEAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C/2001 Q4 (NEAT)|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=C/2001+Q4|website=JPL Small-Body Database Browser|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An asteroid was named in its honour, [[64070 NEAT]], in early 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=64070 NEAT (2001 SS272)|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=64070+NEAT|website=JPL Small-Body Database Browser|publisher=NASA|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2239">'''Peg Powler''' is a [[hag]] and [[water spirit]] in [[English folklore]] who inhabits the [[River Tees]]. Similar to the [[Grindylow]], [[Jenny Greenteeth]] and [[Nelly Longarms]], she drags children into the water if they get too close to the edge. She is regarded as a [[bogeyman]] figure who is invoked by parents to frighten children into proper behaviour.&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Briggs, Katharine (1976). ''An Encyclopedia of Fairies''. Pantheon Books. pp. 323–324. {{ISBN|0394409183}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denham, Michael and Hardy, James (1895). ''[[Denham Tracts]]'' (Vol. 2). David Nutt for [[The Folklore Society]]. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th century folklorist William Henderson describes Peg Powler as having green hair and "an insatiable desire for human life", and she is said to lure people into the river to drown or be devoured. The foam or froth which is often seen floating on certain parts of the Tees is called "Peg Powler's suds" or "Peg Powler's cream".&lt;ref name=Briggs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, William (1879). ''Folklore of the Northern Counties of England and the Borders'' (2nd ed.) W. Satchell, Peyton &amp; Co. p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar creature named '''Nanny Powler''' is said to haunt the [[River Skerne]], a tributary of the [[River Tees|Tees]]. [[Michael Denham]] regards her as either the sister or daughter of Peg Powler.&lt;ref&gt;Denham and Hardy (1895). p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elliott O'Donnell]] paints a somewhat different picture of Peg Powler in his 1924 book ''Ghosts, Helpful and Harmful''. He describes her as a spirit who lures men and boys to their doom in the River Tees by appearing as a beautiful young woman with green hair and pretending to drown so that her victim will enter the water in an attempt to save her. She may even appear on land on foggy nights and lead men astray until they stumble into the river.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, Elliott (1924). ''Ghosts, Helpful and Harmful''. Richard Clay &amp; Sons. pp. 199–202.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phonolite''' is an uncommon [[volcanic rock]], of [[intermediate composition|intermediate chemical composition]] between [[felsic]] and [[mafic]], with texture ranging from [[aphanitic]] (fine-grain) to [[porphyritic]] (mixed fine- and coarse-grain).

The name phonolite comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] meaning "sounding stone" because of the metallic sound it produces if an unfractured plate is hit; hence the English name ''clinkstone''.

== Formation ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}

Unusually, phonolite forms from [[magma]] with a relatively low [[silica]] content, generated by low degrees of [[partial melting]] (less than 10%) of highly aluminous rocks of the lower [[crust (geology)|crust]] such as [[tonalite]], [[monzonite]] and [[metamorphic rock]]s. Melting of such rocks to a very low degree promotes the liberation of aluminium, potassium, sodium and calcium by melting of [[feldspar]], with some involvement of mafic minerals. Because the rock is silica-[[Saturation (chemistry)|undersaturated]], it has no [[quartz]] or [[Quartz#Related silica minerals|other silica crystals]], and is dominated by low-silica [[feldspathoid]] minerals more than feldspar minerals.

A few geological processes and tectonic events can melt the necessary precursor rocks to form phonolite. These include intracontinental [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] volcanism, such as may form above [[mantle plume]]s covered by thick [[continental crust]]. A-type [[granite]]s and alkaline igneous provinces usually occur alongside phonolites. Low-degree partial melting of underplates of granitic material in collisional [[Orogeny|orogenic belts]] may also produce phonolites.

== Mineralogy and petrology ==
[[File:Petrology Igneous.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Total alkali vs. silica classification scheme (TAS), as proposed in Le Maitre's 2002 Igneous Rocks – A classification and glossary of terms&lt;ref name=Ridley&gt;Ridley, W. I., 2012, Petrology of Igneous Rocks, Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide Occurrence Model, USGS Scientific Report 2010-5070-C, Chapter 15.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|237}}]]
Phonolite is a fine-grained equivalent of [[nepheline syenite]]. They are products of partial melting, are silica-undersaturated, and have feldspathoids in their [[normative mineralogy]].

Mineral assemblages in phonolite occurrences are usually abundant [[feldspathoid]]s ([[nepheline]], [[sodalite]], [[hauyne]], [[leucite]] and [[analcite]]) and alkali [[feldspar]] ([[sanidine]], [[anorthoclase]] or [[orthoclase]]), and rare sodic [[plagioclase]]. [[Biotite]], sodium-rich [[amphibole]]s and [[pyroxene]]s along with iron-rich [[olivine]] are common minor minerals. Accessory phases include [[titanite]], [[apatite]], [[corundum]], [[zircon]], [[magnetite]] and [[ilmenite]].&lt;ref&gt;Blatt, Harvey and Robert J. Tracy, ''Petrology'', Freeman, 2nd ed. 1996, p. 52, {{ISBN|0-7167-2438-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence ==
[[Image:Phonolite Beemerville Complex NJ.jpg|thumb|right|Outcrop of phonolite at Beemerville Complex, New Jersey]]

== Economic importance ==
Phonolites can be of interest as [[dimension stone]] or as aggregate for gravels.

Rarely, economically mineralised phonolite-nepheline syenite alkaline complexes can be associated with [[rare-earth]] mineralisation, [[uranium]] mineralisation and [[phosphate]]s, such as at [[Phalaborwa, South Africa]].

Phonolite [[tuff]] was used as a source of [[flint]] for [[adze]] heads and such by prehistoric people from [[Hohentwiel]] and [[Hegau]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Affolter, J., 2002, '' Provenance des silex préhistoriques du Jura et des régions limitrophes'', Archéologie neuchâteloise, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phonolites can be separated into slabs of appropriate dimensions to be used as roofing tiles in place of roofing slate. One such occurrence is in the French [[Massif Central]] region such as the [[Haute Loire]] département.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

The '''magnetic effect''' is a theoretical [[quantum mechanical]] effect discovered by the researchers Samuel L. Oliveira and Stephen C. Rand at [[University of Michigan]] 2007–2011.

Solar power without solar cells: A hidden magnetic effect of light could make it possible. ScienceDaily] Quote: "..."You could stare at the equations of motion all day and you will not see this possibility. We've all been taught that this doesn't happen," said Rand, an author of a paper on the work published in the Journal of Applied Physics. "It's a very odd interaction. That's why it's been overlooked for more than 100 years."..."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/45787 Apr 21, 2011, physicsworld.com: Solar power without solar cells]&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers have discovered a powerful magnetic interaction between the [[photon]]s dynamic [[magnetic field]]&amp;nbsp;– and certain [[Optical isolator|isolator]] materials [[atom]]s magnetic moment, that is 100 million times stronger than formerly anticipated. Under the proper circumstances, the photons magnetic fields effect is as strong as their [[electric field]]&amp;nbsp;– as e.g. in [[solar cell]]s.

The discovery is a surprise, because it is not straightforward to derive the strong magnetic effect from the physical equations, and thereby indicate that this quantum mechanical effect would be interesting enough. That is why the photomagnetic effect has been neglected for more than 100 years.

The researchers have theoretically calculated that [[Coherence (physics)|incoherent]] light as e.g. [[sunlight]], is almost as efficient as [[laser]]light, to be converted by the photomagnetic effect.

The power density should be 10 million watt per square centimeter, but the researchers will look for new photomagnetic materials, that can work with lower light [[Intensity (physics)|intensities]].

'''Pi Orionis''' (π Ori, π Orionis) is a group of fairly widely scattered [[star]]s in the [[constellation]] [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] that constitute the [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] '''Orion's Shield''' or '''Orion's Bow'''.&lt;ref name=RBR-Orion&gt;astrofoto.org, [http://www.astrofoto.org/book/export/html/92 "Orion: The Hunter"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610090338/http://www.astrofoto.org/book/export/html/92 |date=2013-06-10 }}, Roland B. Roberts&lt;/ref&gt;

They form an exception to the general rule that stars that share the same [[Bayer designation]] are close together: π&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is nearly 9° north of π&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; ([[Tau Eridani]] is an even more noteworthy example of this).

At the center is [[Tahiti]] (5), with [[Samoa]] (4) to the west.]]

The '''Polynesian Triangle''' is a region of the [[Pacific Ocean]] with three island groups at its corners: [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] (formerly "the Sandwich Islands"), [[Easter Island]] (''Rapa Nui'') and [[New Zealand]] (''[[Aotearoa]]''). It is often used as a simple way to define [[Polynesia]].

Outside the triangle, there are traces of Polynesian settlement as far north as [[Necker Island (Hawaii)|Necker Island (''Mokumanamana'')]], as far east as [[Isla Salas y Gómez|Salas y Gómez Island (''Motu Motiro Hiva'')]], and as far south as [[Enderby Island|Enderby Island (''Motu Maha'')]]. There was also once Polynesian settlement on [[Norfolk Island]] and [[Kermadec Islands|Kermadec Island (''Rangitahua'')]]. However, by the time the Europeans first arrived, these islands were all uninhabited.

Today, the most numerous [[Polynesian peoples]] are the [[Māori people|Māori]], [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiians]], [[Tongans]], [[Samoans]], and [[Tahitians]]. The native languages of this vast triangle are [[Polynesian languages]], which are classified by linguists as part of the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic subgroup]] of [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]].  They ultimately derive from the [[proto-Austronesian language]] spoken in [[Southeast Asia]] 5,000 years ago. There are also numerous [[Polynesian outliers|Polynesian outlier islands]] outside the triangle in neighboring [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]].

==History==

Anthropologists believe that all modern [[Polynesian culture]]s descend from a single [[protoculture]] established in the South Pacific by migrant Malayo-Polynesian people (''see also'' [[Lapita]]). There is also some evidence that Polynesians ventured as far east as the [[Isla Salas y Gómez]] and as far south as the [[New Zealand Subantarctic Islands|subantarctic islands to the south of New Zealand]], however none of these islands are reckoned with Polynesia proper, as no viable settlements have survived. A shard of pottery has been found in the [[Antipodes Islands]], and is now in the [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|Te Papa]] museum in [[Wellington]], and there are also remains of a Polynesian settlement dating back to the 13th century on [[Enderby Island]] in the [[Auckland Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Tom ''Polynesians in the Southern Ocean: Occupation of the Auckland Islands in Prehistory'' in New Zealand Geographic 69 (September–October 2004): 6-8)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Atholl J., &amp; Gerard R. O'Regan ''To the Final Shore: Prehistoric Colonisation of the Subantarctic Islands in South Polynesia'' in ''Australian Archaeologist: Collected Papers in Honour of Jim Allen'' Canberra: Australian National University, 2000. 440-454.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Atholl J., &amp; Gerard R. O'Regan ''The Polynesian Archaeology of the Subantarctic Islands: An Initial Report on Enderby Island'' Southern Margins Project Report.

In contrast to the shape of a triangle, another theory states that the geography of Polynesian society and navigation pathways more accurately resemble the geometric qualities of an octopus with head centred on [[Ra'iātea]] (French Polynesia) and tentacles spread out across the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;E. Tetahiotupa, ''Au gré des vents et des courants'' ([[Éditions des Mers Australes]]) 2009, https://www.tahiti-infos.com/Pourquoi-le-Triangle-polynesien-est-une-pieuvre_a135121.html&lt;/ref&gt; In Polynesian oral tradition the octopus is known by various names such as [[Taumata-Fe'e-Fa'atupu-Hau]] (Grand Octopus of Prosperity), [[Tumu-Ra'i-Fenua]] (Beginning-of-Heaven-and-Earth) and [[Te Wheke-a-Muturangi]] (The Octopus of [[Muturangi]]).

The '''Puerto Rican dry forests''' are a [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|subtropical dry forest]] ecoregion located in southwestern and eastern [[Puerto Rico]] and on the offshore islands.&lt;ref name="Ewel"&gt;Ewel, J.J. and Whitmore, J.L. (1973) The ecological life zones of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  USDA Forest Service, Institute of Tropical Forestry, Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico.&lt;/ref&gt; They cover an area of {{convert|1300|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion |id=nt0226 |name=Puerto Rican dry forests|accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These forests grow in areas receiving less than {{convert|1000|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain annually.  Many of the trees are [[deciduous]], losing their leaves during the [[dry season]] which normally lasts from December to July.&lt;ref name="Murphy et al."&gt;Murphy, P.G., Lugo, A.E., Murphy, A.J., Nepstad, D.C. (1995) The dry forests of Puerto Rico's south coast.  Pp. 178-209 ''in'' A.E. Lugo and C. Lowe (editors) ''Tropical Forests: Management and Ecology''.  Springer-Verlag, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
Dry forests exist in two areas on the island of Puerto Rico - along the south coast of the island (in the dry [[rain shadow|orographic rain shadow]] of the [[Cordillera Central (Puerto Rico)|Cordillera Central]]) and in the northeastern corner of the island near [[Fajardo, Puerto Rico|Fajardo]], where the combination of low elevation and strong winds off the ocean ([[Trade wind|Northeast Trade Winds]]) result in a dry environment.  Dry forests also exist on the adjacent off-shore islands of [[Vieques]], [[Culebra, Puerto Rico|Culebra]], [[Mona, Puerto Rico|Mona]], [[Monito Island|Monito]], [[Desecheo Island|Desecheo]], [[Caja de Muertos]] and [[Cayo Santiago]].

The vast majority of studies have focused on the south coast - almost nothing has been published about the northeastern dry forest.  Studies of the offshore islands have been limited to species lists and qualitative descriptions of the vegetation.

==Ecology==
Puerto Rican dry forests (like [[Caribbean]] dry forests in general) consist of short-stature (usually &lt;{{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} tall), multi-stemmed trees.  The canopy is largely evergreen (dominated by ''[[Gymnanthes lucida]]'' ([[Euphorbiaceae]]) in areas of limestone soil), while the emergent layer is considerably more dry-season deciduous.&lt;ref name="Lugo et al."&gt;Lugo, A. E., J. A. Gonzalez-Liboy, B. Cintrón, and K. Dugger. (1978) Structure, productivity and transpiration of a subtropical dry forest in Puerto Rico. ''Biotropica'' 10:278-291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murphy &amp; Lugo1"&gt;Murphy, P. G., and A. E. Lugo. (1986) Structure and biomass of a subtropical dry forest in Puerto Rico. ''Biotropica'' 18:89-96.&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Guaiacum officinale]]'', ''[[Coccoloba venosa]]'', ''[[Ceiba pentandra]]'', and ''[[Capparis cynophallophora]]'' are common trees in coastal dry forests. Dry limestone forest species include ''[[Pisonia albida]]'', ''[[Guaiacum sanctum]]'', and ''[[Plumeria alba]]''.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

Although most of the forest was destroyed for [[agriculture]] prior to the 1940s, some patches of forest which pre-date that period still exist.  Areas that were used for [[charcoal]] production or for fence-posts have recovered rapidly - after 50 years forests that had been used for charcoal production recovered to the point where they were indistinguishable from much older forests.&lt;ref name = "Molina"&gt;Molina Colón, S. (1998) Long-term recovery of a Caribbean dry forest after abandonment of different land uses in Guánica, Puerto Rico. Ph. D. University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, large areas of [[secondary forest]] have grown back on abandoned agricultural land.  Unlike areas which were only lightly used, these forests on abandoned farmland have far fewer species than do natural forests.  Their path to recovery remains uncertain.  

[[Image:Psychilis krugii.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''[[Psychilis krugii]]'', an endemic [[orchid]] of dry limestone forests of Puerto Rico at the Guánica State Forest.]]
Puerto Rican dry forests are dominated by plants in the families [[Rubiaceae]], Euphorbiaceae, and [[Myrtaceae]].  In this regard they are similar to [[Jamaican dry forests]], but differ sharply from dry forests on the mainland of [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]], which are dominated by  [[Fabaceae]] and [[Bignoniaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;Gentry, A.H. (1995) Diversity and floristic composition of neotropical dry forests.  Pp. 146-194 ''in'' S.H. Bullock, H.A. Mooney and E. Medina (editors) ''Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests''.  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best example of dry forests in Puerto Rico (and probably, in the Caribbean as a whole) are in the [[Guánica State Forest]] (''Bosque Estatal de Guánica'') outside the town of [[Guánica, Puerto Rico|Guánica]].  This site has also been the focus of the vast majority of studies of dry forests.

'''Pulsed energy projectile''' or '''PEP''' is a technology of [[non-lethal weapon]]ry currently under development by the [[U.S. military]]. It involves the emission of an invisible [[laser]] pulse which, upon contact with the target, ablates the surface and creates a small amount of exploding [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. This produces a pressure wave that stuns the target and knocks him off his feet, and [[electromagnetic radiation]] that affects [[nerve cells]] causing a painful sensation. The technology can also be used as a lethal weapon, and indeed an early name was ''[[pulsed impulsive kill laser]]''.

The pulsed energy projectile is intended for [[riot control]] and is said to work over distances of up to 2&amp;nbsp;km. It weighs about 230&amp;nbsp;kg and will probably be mounted on vehicles. The weight could become lighter as laser production technology improves.

The system was developed by [[Mission Research Corporation]] (now owned by [[Orbital ATK]]). It uses a chemical [[deuterium fluoride laser]] device producing [[infrared]] laser pulses.  The plasma (produced by the early part of the pulse) explodes because its [[electron]]s absorb the energy of the later part of the pulse.

In 2003, a US military review reported{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} that the electromagnetic radiation produced by PEPs had been shown to cause pain and temporary paralysis in animal experiments.

United States Special Operations Command FY 2010 plans included starting developmental work on a Counter UAV Pulsed Energy Projectile.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/pep.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The PEP started a lot of controversy when it appeared that a team under the leadership of Brian Cooper was assigned to work on the pain factor of the weapon. It was discovered that the PEP could, additionally to the high pain it could already induce, with some tweaking, induce cold burn feelings and other forms of painful sensations. The controversy and the fear of the public opinion to see it turned into a torture tool that wouldn't leave any physical evidence on the victim ended the official program, Though Brian Cooper kept on studying effects of laser-generated plasma pulse on pain receptors and published a paper in 2008 called "Frequency Dependent Interaction of Ultrashort E-Fields with Nociceptor Membranes and Proteins.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21225892 | doi=10.1002/bem.20620 | volume=32 | title=Frequency-dependent interaction of ultrashort E-fields with nociceptor membranes and proteins | journal=Bioelectromagnetics | pages=148–63 | last1 = Jiang | first1 = N | last2 = Cooper | first2 = BY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sea of Galilee''' ({{lang-he-n|יָם כִּנֶּרֶת}}, [[Judeo-Aramaic language|Judeo-Aramaic]]: יַמּא דטבריא, גִּנֵּיסַר, {{lang-ar|بحيرة طبريا}}), '''Kinneret''' or '''Kinnereth''',&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew letter "''[[ת]]''" (Tav) is often transliterated as "''Th''".&lt;/ref&gt; '''Lake of Gennesaret''', or '''Lake Tiberias''', is a [[freshwater]] [[lake]] in [[Israel]]. It is approximately {{convert|53|km|mi|abbr=on}} in circumference, about {{convert|21|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide. Its area is {{convert|166.7|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} at its fullest, and its maximum depth is approximately 43 m (141&amp;nbsp;feet).&lt;ref name=ilec&gt;[http://wldb.ilec.or.jp/Lake.asp?LakeID=ASI-09 Data Summary: Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203051354/http://wldb.ilec.or.jp/Lake.asp?LakeID=ASI-09 |date=2014-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At levels between {{convert|215|m|ft}} and {{convert|209|m|ft}} below sea level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kinneret.ocean.org.il/dc_lake_general.aspx|title=Kinneret – General|language=hebrew|publisher=Israel Oceanographic &amp; Limnological Research Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the lowest freshwater lake on Earth and the second-lowest lake in the world (after the [[Dead Sea]], a [[Salt lake|saltwater lake]]).&lt;ref&gt;The 1996-discovered [[subglacial lake|subglacial]] [[Lake Vostok]] challenges both records; it is estimated to be {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}} below sea level.&lt;/ref&gt; The lake is fed partly by underground springs although its main source is the [[Jordan River]] which flows through it from north to south.

==Geography==
[[File:JordanRiver en.svg|thumb|250px|Sea of Galilee in relation to the Dead Sea]]

The Sea of Galilee is situated in northeast [[Israel]], between the [[Golan Heights]] and the [[Galilee]] region, in the [[Jordan Rift Valley]], the valley caused by the separation of the [[African Plate|African]] and [[Arabian Plate]]s. Consequently, the area is subject to [[earthquake]]s, and in the past, [[volcano|volcanic]] activity. This is evident by the abundant [[basalt]] and other [[igneous]] rocks that define the geology of Galilee.

==Names==
The lake has been called by different names throughout its history, usually depending on the dominant settlement on its shores. With the changing fate of the towns, the lake's name also changed.
:'''Lake or Sea of Kinneret'''
The modern Hebrew name, ''Kinneret'', comes from the [[Hebrew Bible]], the main source of the Christian [[Old Testament]], where it appears as the "sea of Kinneret" in {{bibleref|Numbers|34:11|HE}} and {{bibleref|Joshua|13:27|HE}}, spelled כנרות "Kinnerot" in [[Hebrew]] in {{bibleref|Joshua|11:2|HE}}. This name was also found in the scripts of [[Ugarit]], in the [[Danel|Aqhat Epic]]. ''Kinneret'' was listed among the "fenced cities" in {{bibleref2|Joshua|19:35|9}}. A persistent, though likely erroneous, popular etymology of the name presumes that the name ''Kinneret'' may originate from the Hebrew word ''[[kinnor]]'' ("harp" or "lyre") in view of the shape of the lake.&lt;ref&gt;Easton's Revised Bible Dictionary, Chinnereth. Another speculation is that the name comes from a fruit called in Biblical Hebrew ''kinar'', which is thought to be the fruit of [[Ziziphus spina-christi]].&lt;/ref&gt; The scholarly consensus, however, is that the origin of the name lies with the important [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]] city of [[Gennesaret|Kinneret]], excavated at Tell el-'Oreimeh.&lt;ref name=Negev&gt;{{cite book |editor=Avraham Negev, Shimon Gibson |year=2001 |title=Archaeological Encyclopedia of the Holy Land |location=New York, London |publisher=Continuum |page=285 |isbn=0-8264-1316-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence that the city of Kinneret itself was not named after the body of water rather than vice versa, or for the origin of the town's name.

:'''Lake of Gennesaret'''
All Old and [[New Testament]] writers use the term "sea" (Hebrew יָם ''yam'', Greek θάλασσα), with the exception of [[gospel of Luke|Luke]] who calls it "the Lake of Gennesaret" ({{bibleref2|Luke|5:1|9;TR1550}}), from the Greek λίμνη Γεννησαρέτ (''limnē Gennēsaret''), the "Grecized form of Chinnereth" according to Easton (1897).&lt;ref&gt;Easton, ''Gennesaret''.&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Sea of Ginosar'''
The [[Babylonian Talmud]], as well as [[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]] mention the sea by the name "Sea of Ginosar" after the small fertile plain of [[Ginosar]] that lies on its western side.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Ginosar is yet another name derived from "Kinneret".&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt;

:'''Sea of Galilee''', '''Sea of Tiberias''', '''Lake Tiberias'''
In the New Testament the term "sea of Galilee" ({{Lang-el|θάλασσαν τῆς Γαλιλαίας}}, ''thalassan tēs Galilaias'') is used in the [[gospel of Matthew]] {{bibleref2|Matthew|4:18;15:29|9|4:18; 15:29}}, the [[gospel of Mark]] {{bibleref2|Mark|1:16;7:31|9|1:16; 7:31}}, and in the [[gospel of John]] {{bibleref2-nb|John|6:1|9}} as "the sea of Galilee, which is ''the sea'' of Tiberias" (θαλάσσης τῆς Γαλιλαίας τῆς Τιβεριάδος, ''thalassēs tēs Galilaias tēs Tiberiados''), the late 1st century CE name.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, ''Tiberias''&lt;/ref&gt; Sea of [[Tiberias]] is also the name mentioned in Roman texts and in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], and was adopted into Arabic as {{Audio|ArTiberias.ogg|''Buhairet Tabariyya''}} (بحيرة طبريا), "Lake Tiberias".

:'''Sea of Minya'''
From the [[Umayyad]] through the [[Mamluk]] period the lake was known in Arabic as "Bahr al-Minya", the "Sea of Minya", after the Umayyad ''[[Ksar|qasr]]'' complex whose ruins are still visible at [[Khirbat al-Minya]]. This is the name employed by the medieval [[Persian people|Persian]] and [[Arabs|Arab]] scholars [[Al-Baladhuri]], [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Al-Tabari]] and [[Ibn Kathir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jalili48.com/pub/xENShowGallery.aspx?sub=What_Remained_of_the_destroyed&amp;sub2=Khirbet_Al-Minya&amp;Cid=1294 |title=Khirbet Al-Minya |work=Jalili48 |publisher=Professor Dr. Moslih Kanaaneh |date=12 May 2006 |accessdate=3 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Prehistory===
In 1989, remains of a [[hunter-gatherer]] site were found under the water at the southern end. Remains of mud huts were found in [[Ohalo]]. Nahal Ein Gev, located about 3&amp;nbsp;km east of the lake, contains a village from the late [[Natufian]] period. The site is considered one of the first permanent human settlements in the world from a time predating the [[Neolithic revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Antiquity===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Christ Appears on the Shore of Lake Tiberias (Apparition du Christ sur les bords du lac de Tibériade) - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|''Jesus appears on the shore of Lake Tiberias''  by James Tissot]]
[[File:Petri Fischzug Raffael.jpg|thumb|Jesus and the [[miraculous catch of fish]], in the Sea of Galilee, by [[Raphael]]]]

The Sea of Galilee lies on the ancient [[Via Maris]], which linked [[Egypt]] with the northern empires. The [[Greeks]], [[Hasmonean]]s, and [[Roman Empire|Romans]] founded flourishing towns and settlements on the land-locked lake including [[Hippos]] and [[Tiberias]]. The first-century historian [[Flavius Josephus]] was so impressed by the area that he wrote, "One may call this place the ambition of Nature"; he also reported a thriving fishing industry at this time, with 230 boats regularly working in the lake. Archaeologists discovered one such boat, nicknamed the [[Jesus Boat]], in 1986.

In the New Testament, much of the [[ministry of Jesus]] occurs on the shores of Lake Galilee. In those days, there was a continuous ribbon development of settlements and villages around the lake and plenty of trade and ferrying by boat. The [[Synoptic Gospels]] of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] (1:14–20), [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] (4:18–22), and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] (5:1–11) describe how Jesus recruited four of his [[Twelve apostles|apostles]] from the shores of Lake Galilee: the fishermen [[Saint Peter|Simon]] and his brother [[Saint Andrew|Andrew]] and the brothers [[John the Apostle|John]] and [[Saint James the Great|James]]. One of Jesus' famous teaching episodes, the [[Sermon on the Mount]], is supposed to have been given on a hill overlooking the lake. Many of his miracles are also said to have occurred here including [[Jesus walks on water|his walking on water]], [[calming the storm]], the disciples and the [[miraculous catch of fish]], and his [[feeding the multitude|feeding five thousand people]] (in [[Tabgha]]). In [[John's Gospel]] the sea provides the setting for Jesus' third [[Post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus|post-resurrection appearance]] to his disciples (John 21).
[[File:Lake Tiberias (Sea of Galilee), Northern Israel.jpg|thumb|upright|View of the Sea of Galilee from space]]
In 135 CE, [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] was put down. The Romans responded by banning all Jews from [[Jerusalem]]. The center of Jewish culture and learning shifted to the region of Galilee and the Kinneret, particularly the city of [[Tiberias]]. It was in this region that the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] was compiled.&lt;ref&gt;In the time of the [[Byzantine Empire]], the lake's significance in Jesus' life made it a major destination for [[Christian pilgrimage|Christian pilgrims]]. This led to the growth of a full-fledged [[tourist]] industry, complete with package tours and plenty of comfortable inns.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
The lake's importance declined when the Byzantines lost control and the area was conquered by  the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] and subsequent Islamic empires. Apart from Tiberias, the major towns and cities in the area were gradually abandoned.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The palace [[Khirbat al-Minya]] was built by the lake during the reign of the Umayyad caliph [[al-Walid I]] (705–715 CE).  In 1187, [[Saladin]] defeated the armies of the [[Crusades]] at the [[Battle of Hattin]], largely because he was able to cut the Crusaders off from the valuable fresh water of the Sea of Galilee.

===Modern era===

[[File:Nofkinneret.jpg|thumb|Southern tip of the lake, seen from Mount Poriya]]
The lake had little importance within the early Ottoman Empire. Tiberias did see a significant revival of its Jewish community in the 16th century, but had gradually declined, until in 1660 the city was completely [[1660 destruction of Tiberias|destroyed]]. In the early 18th century, Tiberias was rebuilt by [[Zahir al-Umar]], becoming the center of his rule over Galilee, and seeing also a revival of its Jewish community.

In 1909, Jewish pioneers established the first cooperative farming village ([[kibbutz]]), [[Kvutzat Kinneret]] in the immediate vicinity of the lake. The settlement trained Jewish immigrants in farming and agriculture. Later, Kvutzat Kinneret pioneers established Kibbutz [[Degania Alef]]. The Kvutzat Kinneret is considered the cradle of the kibbutz culture of early [[Zionism]] and is the birthplace of [[Naomi Shemer]] and the burial site of [[Rachel (poet)|Rachel]]—two of the most prominent Israeli poets.

In 1917, the British defeated Ottoman Turkish forces and took control of Palestine, while France took control of Syria. In the carve-up of the Ottoman territories between Britain and France, it was agreed that Britain would retain control of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], while France would control Syria. However, the allies had to fix the border between the [[Mandatory Palestine]] and the [[French Mandate of Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/palmanda.htm The Preamble of the League of Nations Mandate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421094709/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/palmanda.htm |date=2016-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary was defined in broad terms by the [[Franco-British Boundary Agreement (1920)|Franco-British Boundary Agreement]] of December 1920, which drew it across the middle of the lake.&lt;ref name="treaty1920"&gt;Franco-British Convention on Certain Points Connected with the Mandates for Syria and the Lebanon, Palestine and Mesopotamia, signed Dec. 23, 1920. Text available in ''American Journal of International Law'', Vol. 16, No. 3, 1922, 122–126.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the commission established by the 1920 treaty redrew the boundary. The Zionist movement pressured the French and British to assign as many water sources as possible to [[Mandatory Palestine]] during the demarcating negotiations. The High Commissioner of Palestine, [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], had sought full control of the Sea of Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jC9MbKNh8GUC ''The boundaries of modern Palestine, 1840–1947''] (2004), by Gideon Biger. Publisher Rutledge Curzon. {{ISBN|978-0-7146-5654-0}}, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; The negotiations led to the inclusion into the Palestine territory of the whole Sea of Galilee, both sides of the [[River Jordan]], [[Lake Hula]], Dan spring, and part of the [[Yarmouk River|Yarmouk]].&lt;ref&gt;''The boundaries of modern Palestine, 1840–1947'', p. 150. and 130.&lt;/ref&gt; The final border approved in 1923 followed a 10-meter wide strip along the lake's northeastern shore,&lt;ref&gt;''The boundaries of modern Palestine, 1840–1947'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; cutting the [[Mandatory Syria]] ([[State of Damascus]]) off from the lake.

The British and French Agreement provided that existing rights over the use of the waters of the Jordan by the inhabitants of Syria would be maintained; the Government of Syria would have the right to erect a new pier at [[Semakh]] on Lake Tiberias or jointly use the existing pier; persons or goods passing between the landing-stage on the Lake of Tiberias and Semakh would not be subject to customs regulations, and the Syrian government would have access to the said landing-stage; the inhabitants of Syria and Lebanon would have the same fishing and navigation rights on Lakes Huleh, Tiberias and River Jordan, while the Government of Palestine would be responsible for policing of lakes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://untreaty.un.org/unts/60001_120000/20/29/00039450.pdf Agreement between His Majesty's Government and the French Government respecting the Boundary Line between Syria and Palestine from the Mediterranean to El Hámmé] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909201308/http://untreaty.un.org/unts/60001_120000/20/29/00039450.pdf |date=2008-09-09 }}, Treaty Series No. 13 (1923), Cmd. 1910. Page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 15, 1948, Syria invaded the newborn State of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/flash/0,,720353,00.html|title=Israel and the Palestinians - a history - guardian.co.uk - guardian.co.uk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; capturing territory along the Sea of Galilee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alnakba.org/chronology/sixth.htm|title= The Year of 1948|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the 1949 [[Israel–Syria Mixed Armistice Commission|armistice agreement]] between Israel and Syria, Syria occupied the northeast shoreline of the Sea of Galilee. The agreement, though, stated that the armistice line was "not to be interpreted as having any relation whatsoever to ultimate territorial arrangements." Syria remained in possession of the lake's northeast shoreline until the 1967 [[Six-Day War|Arab-Israeli war]].

In the 1950s, Israel formulated a plan to link the Kinneret with the rest of the country's water infrastructure via the [[National Water Carrier of Israel|National Water Carrier]], in order to supply the water demand of the growing country. The carrier was completed in 1964. The Israeli plan, to which the [[Arab League]] opposed its own [[Headwater Diversion Plan (Jordan River)|plan to divert the headwaters of the Jordan River]], sparked political and sometimes even armed [[War over Water (Jordan river)|confrontations]] over the Jordan River basin.

After 5 years of drought {{as of|2018|lc=yes}}, Sea of Galilee is expected to get to the [[black line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelhayom.co.il/article/528479|title=שר האנרגיה הכריז: מצב חירום במשק המים - ישראל היום|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The black elevation line is the lowest depth from which irreversible damage begin and no water can be pumped out anymore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.makorrishon.co.il/nrg/online/1/ART1/753/814.html|title=חדשות - בארץ nrg - מומחים: מצב המים – הקשה מקום המדינה|website=www.makorrishon.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel Oceanographic and Limnological Research describe it as "The black line marks -214.87 m, the lowest-ever level reached since 1926 when the water level record began. According to the water authority, the Kinneret water level must not decline below this level."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kinneret.ocean.org.il/level_grp.aspx|title=כנרת - מפלס האגם|website=kinneret.ocean.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, The city of [[Tiberias]] requested a [[desalination plant]] to treat the water coming from the Sea of Galilee and demanded a new water source for the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-5115265,00.html|title=בטבריה חוששים להישאר בלי מים - ומבקשים מתקן התפלה|first=אילנה|last=קוריאל|date=16 February 2018|publisher=|via=Ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; March 2018 was the lowest point in water income{{definition needed|date=July 2018}} to the lake since 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.20il.co.il/%D7%9B%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%A1%D7%94-%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%A8%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%99%D7%90-%D7%94%D7%A0%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%94-%D7%91%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA/|title=כמות המים שנכנסה לכנרת היא הנמוכה ביותר שנרשמה מאז 1927 - חדשות 20|first=הרבה יותר נוח לגלוש באפליקציית חדשות 20, לחץ עכשיו|last=להורדה|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018 the [[Ministry of National Infrastructures, Energy and Water Resources|Israeli energy  and water office]] announced a project to purr [[Desalination|desalinated]] water from the Mediterranean sea into the sea of Galilee using an underground tunnel, the tunnel is expected to be largest of its kind done in Israel and will transfer half of the Mediterranean desalted water and will push 300 to 500 Million cubic litters of water per year.&lt;ref&gt;https://m.calcalist.co.il/Article.aspx?guid=3745482&amp;ref=ynet&lt;/ref&gt; The plan said to cost five billion shekels. [[Giora Eiland]] lead the meetings with the German counterparts to find a suitable contractor to build the project.

==Archaeology==
In 1986 the [[Sea of Galilee Boat|Ancient Galilee Boat]], also known as the Jesus Boat, was discovered on the north-west shore of the Sea of Galilee during a drought when water levels receded. It is an ancient fishing boat from the 1st century AD, and although there is no evidence directly linking the boat to Jesus and his disciples it nevertheless is an example of the kind of boat Jesus and his disciples, some of whom were fishermen, would have used.
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 41392 Settlements in Israel.JPG|thumb|left|Ancient Galilee boat at [[Kibbutz]] [[Ginossar]]]]
During a routine sonar scan in 2003 (finding published in 2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paz|first=Yitzhak|author2=Moshe, Reshef |author3=Ben-Avraham, Zvie |author-link3=Zvi Ben-Avraham |author4=Shmuel, Marco |author5=Tibor, Gideon |author6= Nadel, Dani |title=A Submerged Monumental Structure in the Sea of Galilee, Israel|journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology|date=2013|volume=42|issue=1|pages=189–193|doi=10.1111/1095-9270.12005}}&lt;/ref&gt; archaeologists discovered an enormous conical stone structure. The structure, which has a diameter of around {{convert|230|ft}}, is made of boulders and stones. The ruins are estimated to be between 2,000 and 12,000 years old, and are about {{convert|10|m}} underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/19/world/meast/israel-ancient-structure-mystery/index.html?iref=allsearch| title=Mysterious structure found at bottom of ancient lake| publisher=CNN.com| accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated weight of the monument is over 60,000 tons. Researchers explain that the site resembles early burial sites in Europe and was likely built in the early Bronze Age.

In February 2018, archaeologists discovered seven intact mosaic with [[Greek language|Greek]] inscriptions. One inscription, one of the longest found to date in western Galilee, gives the names of donors and the names and positions of church officials, including [[Irenaeus]]. Another mosaic mentions a woman as a donor to the church’s construction. This inscription is the first in the region to mention a female donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archaeology.org/issues/291-1803/trenches/6359-trenches-galilee-byzantine-mosaics|title=Gods of the Galilee - Archaeology Magazine|first=JARRETT A.|last=LOBELL|website=www.archaeology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water use==
[[File:KinneretLevels-Apr21.jpg|thumb|Sea of Galilee water levels January 2004 – February 2012]]
Israel's [[National Water Carrier of Israel|National Water Carrier]], completed in 1964, transports water from the lake to the population centers of Israel, and in the past supplied most of the country's drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Black gold under the Golan|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21677597-geologists-israel-think-they-have-found-oilin-very-tricky-territory-black-gold|accessdate=8 November 2015|work=[[The Economist]]|date=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays the lake supplies approximately 10% of Israel's drinking water needs.&lt;ref name="themaker1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amit|first1=Hagai|title=הקו האדום של הכנרת נהפך לבעיה של הירדנים|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/tmr/1.2971984|accessdate=12 June 2016|publisher=[[TheMarker]]|trans-title=The Kinneret's Red Line has Turned into Jordan's Problem|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, [[Syria]] attempted construction of a [[Headwater Diversion Plan]] that would have blocked the flow of water into the Sea of Galilee, sharply reducing the water flow into the lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fischhendler, Itay|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/global_environmental_politics/v008/8.1fischhendler.html|title=When Ambiguity in Treaty Design Becomes Destructive: A Study of Transboundary Water|work=[[Global Environmental Politics]]|year=2008|accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project and Israel's attempt to block these efforts in 1965 were factors which played into regional tensions culminating in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. During the war, Israel captured the [[Golan Heights]], which contain some of the sources of water for the Sea of Galilee.

The Israeli government monitors water levels and publishes the results daily at [[#WaterLevel|this web page]]. The level over the past eight years can be retrieved from that site.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|WaterLevel}}[http://www.water.gov.il/Hebrew/WaterResources/Kinneret-Basin/Pages/default.aspx Kinneret Basin Water Level]&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing water demand in Israel, Lebanon and Jordan, as well as dry winters, have resulted in stress on the lake and a decreasing water line to dangerously low levels at times. The Sea of Galilee is at risk of becoming irreversibly salinized by the salt water springs under the lake, which are held in check by the weight of the freshwater on top of them.&lt;ref&gt;Skynews report, 5 May 2009: [http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Sea-Of-Galilee-In-Israel-Is-Facing-Disaster-Says-Friends-Of-The-Earth-Prompting-Government-Campaign/Article/200905115274946 Race To Save Sea Of Galilee From Disaster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508060657/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Sea-Of-Galilee-In-Israel-Is-Facing-Disaster-Says-Friends-Of-The-Earth-Prompting-Government-Campaign/Article/200905115274946 |date=2009-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until the mid-2010s, about {{convert|400000000|m3}} of water was pumped through the National Water Carrier each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Shmuel Kantor | title = The National Water Carrier | url = http://research.haifa.ac.il/~eshkol/kantorb.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the terms of the [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]], Israel also supplies {{convert|50000000|m3}} of water annually from the lake to [[Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/1759b55472ee398b852562d7006b014a?OpenDocument | title=Developments related to the Middle East Peace Process | publisher=UN | accessdate=2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years the Israeli government has made extensive investments in water conservation, [[reclaimed water|reclamation]] and [[Desalination#Israel|desalination]] infrastructure in the country. This has allowed it to significantly reduce the amount of water pumped from the lake annually in an effort to restore and improve its ecological environment, as well as respond to some of the most extreme drought conditions in hundreds of years affecting the lake's [[drainage basin|intake basin]] since 1998. Therefore, it is expected that in 2016 only about {{convert|25000000|m3}} of water will be drawn from the lake for Israeli domestic consumption, a small fraction of the amount typically drawn from the lake over the previous decades.&lt;ref name="themaker1"/&gt;

With extreme drought conditions continuing to intensify, the government of Israel approved a plan in 2018 to pump desalinated water into the lake in an effort to stop the water level from plunging below a point where irreversible ecological damage to the lake might take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lidman|first1=Melanie|title=Government approves plan to pump desalinated water into Sea of Galilee|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/government-approves-plan-to-pump-desalinated-water-into-sea-of-galilee|publisher=[[Times of Israel]]|date=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==

[[Tourism in Israel|Tourism]] around the Sea of Galilee is an important economic branch. Historical and religious sites in the region draw both local and foreign tourists.  The Sea of Galilee is an attraction for [[Christian pilgrimage|Christian pilgrims]] who visit Israel to see the places where Jesus performed miracles according to the [[New Testament]], such as  [[Jesus walks on water|his walking on water]], [[calming the storm]] and [[feeding the multitude]]. Alonzo Ketcham Parker, a nineteenth-century American traveler, called visiting the Sea of Galilee "a 'fifth gospel' which one read devoutly, his heart overflowing with quiet joy".&lt;ref&gt;Parker, A. K., "The Sea of Galilee" in ''The Biblical World'', Vol. 7, No. 4 (April 1896), pages 264–272&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Israel unveiled a {{convert|40|mi|km|adj=on}} [[hiking trail]] in [[Galilee]] for Christian pilgrims, called the "[[Jesus Trail]]".  It includes a network of footpaths, roads and bicycle paths linking sites central to the lives of [[Jesus]] and his disciples. It ends at [[Capernaum]] on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, where Jesus espoused his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/israel-unveils-hiking-trail-galilee-christian-pilgrims-20110415-093756-814.html |accessdate=2011-05-16 |date=April 15, 2011 |title=Israel unveils hiking trail in Galilee for Christian pilgrims |author=Daniel Estrin, Canadian Press |publisher=[[Yahoo!

Another key attraction is the site where the Sea of Galilee's water flows into the [[Jordan River]], to which thousands of pilgrims from all over the world come to be baptized every year.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Israel's most well-known open water swim race, the Kinneret Crossing, is held every year in September, drawing thousands of open water swimmers to participate in competitive and noncompetitive events.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Tourists also partake in the building of rafts on ''Lavnun Beach'', called Rafsodia. Here many different age groups work together to build a raft with their bare hands and then sail that raft across the sea.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Other economic activities include fishing in the lake and [[Agriculture in Israel|agriculture]], particularly [[banana]]s, dates, mangoes, grapes and olives in the fertile belt of land surrounding it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Flora and fauna==
The warm waters of the Sea of Galilee support various flora and fauna, which have supported a significant commercial fishery for more than two millennia. Local flora include various reeds along most of the shoreline as well as [[phytoplankton]]. Fauna include [[zooplankton]], [[benthos]] and a number of fish species such as ''[[Acanthobrama terraesanctae]]''. Fish caught commercially include ''[[Tristramella simonis]]'' and ''[[Sarotherodon galilaeus]]'', locally called "St. Peter’s Fish".&lt;ref name=ilec/&gt; In 2005, {{convert|300|ST}} of tilapia were caught by local fishermen. This dropped to {{convert|8|ST}} in 2009 due to overfishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first= |last= |authorlink= |date=June 2010 |title=Still Fishers of Men |journal=Vermont Catholic |volume=1 |issue=12 |pages=3 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, low water levels in drought years have stressed the lake's ecology. This may have been aggravated by over-extraction of water for either the National Water Carrier to supply other parts of Israel or, since 1994, for the supply of water to Jordan (see ''"Water use"'' section above). Droughts of the early and mid-1990s dried out the marshy northern margin of the lake.&lt;ref name=IUCN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/61372/0 |title=Tristramella sacra |last=Goren |first=M. |year=2006 |work=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species |publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] |accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fish species that is unique to the lake, ''[[Tristramella sacra]]'', used to [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] in the marsh and has not been seen since the 1990s droughts.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; Conservationists fear this species may have become [[Extinction|extinct]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; It is hoped that drastic reductions in the amount of water pumped through the National Water Carrier will help restore the lake's ecology over the span of several years. As such, the amount planned to be drawn in 2016 for Israeli domestic water use is expected to be less than 10% of the amount commonly drawn on an annual basis in the decades before the mid-2010s.&lt;ref name="themaker1"/&gt;

A '''shrub''' or '''bush''' is a small- to medium-sized woody [[plant]]. Unlike [[Herbaceous plant|herbs]], shrubs have persistent [[wood]]y stems above the ground. They are distinguished from [[tree]]s by their multiple stems and shorter [[height]], and are usually under 6&amp;nbsp;m (20&amp;nbsp;ft) tall.&lt;ref name="LawrenceHawthorne2006"&gt;{{cite book

Shrubs in common garden practice are generally considered [[flowering plant|broad-leaved plants]], though some smaller [[Pinophyta|conifers]] such as [[mountain pine]] and [[common juniper]] are also shrubby in structure.

In [[botany]] and [[ecology]], a shrub is more specifically used to describe the particular [[Canopy (biology)|physical structural]] or [[plant life-form]] of woody plants which are less than {{convert|8|m|ft}} high and usually have many stems arising at or near the base.

For example, a descriptive system widely adopted in [[Australia]] is based on structural characteristics based on life-form, plus the height and amount of foliage cover of the tallest layer or [[Dominance (ecology)|dominant]] [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;Costermans, L. F. (1993) ''Native trees and shrubs of South-Eastern Australia''. rev. ed. {{ISBN|0-947116-76-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For shrubs {{convert|2|-|8|m|ft}} high the following structural forms are categorized:
* dense foliage cover (70–100%) — '''closed-shrub'''
* mid-dense foliage cover (30–70%) — '''open-shrub'''
* sparse foliage cover (10–30%) — '''tall shrubland'''
* very sparse foliage cover (&lt;10%) — '''tall open shrubland'''

For shrubs less than {{convert|2|m|ft}} high the following structural forms are categorized:
* dense foliage cover (70–100%) — '''closed-[[heath (habitat)|heath]]''' or '''closed low shrubland'''—(''North America'')
* mid-dense foliage cover (30–70%) — '''open-heath''' or '''mid-dense low shrubland'''—(''North America'')
* sparse foliage cover (10–30%) — '''low shrubland'''
* very sparse foliage cover (&lt;10%) — '''low open shrubland'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6876">The '''Skagerrak-Centered Large Igneous Province''' ('''SCLIP'''), also known as the '''European-Northwest African Large Igneous Province''' ('''EUNWA'''),&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{Harvnb|Doblas|Oyarzun|Lopez-Ruiz|Cebriá|1998|loc=Abstract}}; {{Harvnb|Bryan|Ferrari|2013|loc=Fig. 1, p. 1054}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Jutland LIP''', is a {{Mya|300|million year old}} (Ma) [[large igneous province]] (LIP) centered on what is today the [[Skagerrak]] strait in north-western Europe ({{Coord|57|50|N|9|04|E|display=inline,title}}, paleocoordinates&lt;ref name="Torsvik-etal-p447"&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Smethurst|Burke|Steinberger|2008|loc=Relationship of the Skagerrak LIP eruption site to the deep mantle, pp. 447–448}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Coord|11|N|16|E}} (south of [[Lake Chad]])).  It was named by {{Harvnb|Torsvik|Smethurst|Burke|Steinberger|2008}}.

The SCLIP covered an area of at least {{Convert|0.5|e6km2|abbr=on}} and includes the Oslo and Skagerrak [[graben]]s, areas in south-western Sweden, Scotland, northern England, and the central North Sea.  The SCLIP erupted at 297±4&amp;nbsp;Ma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Smethurst|Burke|Steinberger|2008|loc=The Skagerrak-Centered Large Igneous Province, pp. 444–445}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It produced 228,000&amp;nbsp;km² of currently exposed volcanic material that can be found in Skagerrak, the Oslo Fjord, central North Sea, North-east Germany; 14,000&amp;nbsp;km² of [[Sill (geology)|sills]] in Scotland, England, Germany, The Netherlands, and Sweden; and 3,353&amp;nbsp;km total length of [[Dike (geology)|dykes]] in Scotland, Norway, and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Smethurst|Burke|Steinberger|2008|loc=Fig. 1, p. 445}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The eruption had a relatively short time span, perhaps less than 4&amp;nbsp;Ma, but magma propagated more than {{Convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} from the plume centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Smethurst|Burke|Steinberger|2008|loc=Conclusions, p. 451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plumes derived from a [[superplume]] (or Large Low Shear Velocity Province (LLSVP)) overlay the boundary of the superplume at the [[core-mantle boundary]] (CMB).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Smethurst|Burke|Steinberger|2008|loc=Was the SCLIP generated by a mantle plume?, pp. 445-446}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To test whether the SCLIP met these criteria, Torsvik et al. used a shear-wave [[Tomography|tomographic model]] of the mantle, in which the SCLIP indeed do project down to the margin of the African superplume at the CMB at a depth of 2800&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="Torsvik-etal-p447" /&gt;
A series of LIPs are associated with the African superplume, of which the SCLIP is the oldest: SCLIP (300&amp;nbsp;Ma), [[Bachu Large Igneous Province|Bachu]] (275&amp;nbsp;Ma), [[Emeishan Traps|Emeishan]] (260&amp;nbsp;Ma), [[Siberian Traps|Siberian]] (250&amp;nbsp;Ma), and [[Central Atlantic Magmatic Province|Central Atlantic]] (200&amp;nbsp;Ma).  Its possible that these plumes together caused the break-up of [[Pangaea]] and therefore play an important role in the [[supercontinent cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Li|Zhong|2009|loc=Superplume record during the Pangean cycle, pp. 146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SCLIP is associated with the [[Moscovian (Carboniferous)|Moscovian]] and [[Kasimovian]] stages of the [[Carboniferous rainforest collapse]] around 296-310&amp;nbsp;Ma together with the Siberian [[Barguzin-Vitim Large Igneous Province|Barguzin-Vitim LIP]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19774">'''Stratospheric sulfur aerosols''' are [[sulfur]]-rich [[particulate|particles]] which exist in the [[stratosphere]] region of the [[Earth's atmosphere]].  The layer of the atmosphere in which they exist is known as the Junge layer, or simply the stratospheric aerosol layer.  These particles consist of a mixture of [[sulfuric acid]] and water.  They are created naturally, such as by [[photochemical]] decomposition of sulfur-containing gases, e.g. [[carbonyl sulfide]].  When present in high levels, e.g. after a strong volcanic eruption such as [[Mount Pinatubo]], they produce a cooling effect, by reflecting sunlight, and by modifying clouds as they fall out of the stratosphere.&lt;ref name=bala2008&gt;{{Cite journal | first1 = G. | last1 = Bala| last2 = Duffy| first2 = B.| last3 = Taylor | first3 = E.| title = Impact of geoengineering schemes on the global hydrological cycle| format = Free full text| journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]| url = http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18505844| volume = 105| issue = 22| pages = 7664–7669| date=June 2008 | issn = 0027-8424| pmid = 18505844| pmc = 2409412| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0711648105|bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.7664B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This cooling may persist for a few years before the particles fall out.

An [[aerosol]] is a [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] of fine [[solid]] [[particulate|particles]] or [[liquid]] droplets in a [[gas]].  
The [[sulfate]] particles or [[sulfuric acid]] droplets in the atmosphere are about 0.1 to 1.0 micrometer (a millionth of a meter) in diameter.

Sulfur aerosols are common in the [[troposphere]] as a result of [[pollution]] with [[sulfur dioxide]] from burning [[coal]], and from natural processes.  [[Volcano]]s are a major source of particles in the stratosphere as the force of the [[volcanic eruption]] propels sulfur-containing gases into the stratosphere.  The relative influence of volcanoes on the Junge layer varies considerably according to the number and size of eruptions in any given time period, and also of quantities of sulfur compounds released.  Only [[stratovolcanoes]] containing primarily [[granitic]] rocks are responsible for these fluxes, as [[basaltic]] rock erupted in [[shield volcanoes]] doesn't result in plumes which reach the stratosphere.

Creating stratospheric sulfur aerosols deliberately is a proposed [[climate engineering|geoengineering]] technique which offers a possible solution to some of the problems caused by [[global warming]].  However, this will not be without side effects &lt;ref name=wigley2006&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1131728 | year = 2006 | author = Wigley, T.M. | title = A combined mitigation/geoengineering approach to climate stabilization | volume = 314 | issue = 5798 | pages = 452–4 | pmid = 16973840 | journal = Science | bibcode=2006Sci...314..452W}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has been suggested that the cure may be worse than the disease.&lt;ref name=Robock08/&gt;

Natural sulfur aerosols are formed in vast quantities from the [[Sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] ejected by [[volcanoes]],&lt;ref name="nasa-aerosols"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/hazards/gas/s02aerosols.php |title=Volcanic Sulfur Aerosols Affect Climate and the Earth's Ozone Layer |accessdate=17 February 2009 |publisher=United States Geological Survey }}&lt;/ref&gt; which may be injected directly into the stratosphere during very large ([[Volcanic Explosivity Index]], VEI, of 4 or greater) eruptions. A comprehensive analysis, dealing largely with tropospheric sulfur compounds in the [[atmosphere]], is provided by Bates et al.&lt;ref name="bates"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pubs/outstand/bate1229/estimate.shtml |title=Sulfur emissions to the atmosphere from natural sources | journal=Journal of Atmospheric Chemistry |volume=14 |issue=1–4 |year=1992 |doi=10.1007/BF00115242 |pages=315–337 |author=Bates, T.S., B.K. Lamb, A. Guenther, J. Dignon and R.E. Stoiber |bibcode=1992JAtC...14..315B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPCC AR4 says ''explosive volcanic events are episodic, but the stratospheric aerosols resulting from them yield substantial transitory perturbations to the radiative energy balance of the planet, with both shortwave and longwave effects sensitive to the microphysical characteristics of the aerosols''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During periods lacking volcanic activity (and thus direct injection of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the stratosphere), oxidation of COS ([[carbonyl sulfide]]) dominates the production of stratospheric sulfur aerosol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newmediastudio.org/DataDiscovery/Aero_Ed_Center/Category/A_sulfate.html |title=Sulfate Aerosols }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
{{main|Sulfur cycle}}

The chemistry of stratospheric sulfur aerosols varies significantly according to their source.  Volcanic emissions vary significantly in composition, and have complex chemistry due to the presence of ash particulates and a wide variety of other elements in the plume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VH3-4D2FG64-7&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=1c4665fbf2e86907a5353ec113b2f610 |doi=10.1016/j.atmosenv.2004.06.017 |journal=Atmospheric Environment |volume=38 |issue=33 |year=2004 |pages=5637–5649 |title=Aerosol chemistry of emissions from three contrasting volcanoes in Italy |author=Mathera, T.A., C. Oppenheimer, A.G. Allen and A.J.S. McGonigle |bibcode=2004AtmEn..38.5637M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical reactions affecting both the formation and elimination of sulfur aerosols are not fully understood.  It is difficult to estimate accurately, for example, whether the presence of ash and water vapour is important for aerosol formation from volcanic products, and whether high or low atmospheric concentrations of precursor chemicals (such as SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) are optimal for aerosol formation.  This uncertainty makes it difficult to determine a viable approach for geoengineering uses of sulfur aerosol formation.

==Scientific study==
[[File:Climate Change Attribution.png|thumb|right|Stratospheric sulfates from volcanic emissions cause transient cooling; the purple line showing sustained cooling is from tropospheric sulfate]]

Understanding of these aerosols comes in large part from the study of [[volcanic eruption]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/315/5808/84 |journal=Science |title=Mass-Independent Sulfur Isotopic Compositions in Stratospheric Volcanic Eruptions |author=Baroni, M., M.H.

King |isbn=978-0-295-97585-6 |publisher=University of Washington Press |year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which erupted in 1991 when scientific techniques were sufficiently far advanced to study the effects carefully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Volcano/ |title=Volcanoes and Climate Change |publisher=NASA |work=Earth Observatory |author=Jason Wolfe |date=5 September 2000 |accessdate=19 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the aerosols and their effects on the atmosphere can also be studied in the lab.  Samples of actual particles can be recovered from the [[stratosphere]] using balloons or aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsa.uniparthenope.it/dsa/LinkClick.aspx?link=DUSTER_Summary.pdf&amp;tabid=926&amp;mid=4373&amp;language=it-IT |title=The DUSTER experiment: collection and analysis of aerosol in the high stratosphere |author=Palumbo, P., A.

Zona |accessdate=19 February 2009 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer models can be used to understand the behaviour of aerosol particles, and are particularly useful in modelling their effect on global climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/09/060914182715.htm |title=Stratospheric Injections Could Help Cool Earth, Computer Model Shows | accessdate=19 February 2009 |publisher=ScienceDaily |date=15 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biological experiments in the lab, and field/ocean measurements can establish the formation mechanisms of biologically derived volatile sulfurous gases.&lt;ref name="bates" /&gt;

== Effects ==

It has been established that emission of precursor gases for sulfur aerosols is the principal mechanism by which volcanoes cause episodic [[global cooling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Rampino MR, Self S |title=Sulphur-rich volcanic eruptions and stratospheric aerosols |journal=Nature |volume=310 |pages=677–9 |date=23 August 1984 |doi=10.1038/310677a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v310/n5979/abs/310677a0.html |issue=5979|bibcode = 1984Natur.310..677R }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] AR4 regards stratospheric sulfate aerosols as having a low level of scientific understanding.

This creates a [[global dimming]] effect, where less of the sun's radiation is able to reach the surface of the Earth. This leads to a [[global cooling]] effect. In essence, they act as the reverse of a [[greenhouse gas]], which tends to allow visible light from the sun through, whilst blocking [[infrared light]] emitted from the Earth's surface and its atmosphere. The particles also radiate infrared energy directly, as they lose heat into space.

[[file:Mauna Loa atmospheric transmission.png|thumb|Solar radiation reduction due to volcanic eruptions]]

All aerosols both [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorb]] and [[scattering|scatter]] [[sunlight|solar]] and terrestrial [[radiation]]. This is quantified in the ''Single Scattering Albedo'' (SSA), the ratio of scattering alone to scattering plus absorption (''extinction'') of radiation by a particle. The SSA tends to unity if scattering dominates, with relatively little absorption, and decreases as absorption increases, becoming zero for infinite absorption. For example, sea-salt aerosol has an SSA of 1, as a sea-salt particle only scatters, whereas soot has an SSA of 0.23, showing that it is a major atmospheric aerosol absorber.

Aerosols, natural and [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]], can affect the climate by changing the way [[Electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] is transmitted through the atmosphere. Direct observations of the effects of aerosols are quite limited so any attempt to estimate their global effect necessarily involves the use of computer models. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], IPCC, says: ''While the radiative forcing due to [[greenhouse gas]]es may be determined to a reasonably high degree of accuracy... the uncertainties relating to aerosol radiative forcings remain large, and rely to a large extent on the estimates from global modelling studies that are difficult to verify at the present time''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | contribution=Chapter 6 Radiative Forcing of Climate Change | url=http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/237.htm#678 | title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis.

The aerosols have a role in the destruction of [[ozone]]&lt;ref name="nasa-aerosols" /&gt; due to [[surface chemistry]] effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2003/2001JD001508.shtml |title=Effect of sulfate aerosol on tropospheric NOx and ozone budgets: Model simulations and TOPSE evidence |author=Tie, X.|year=2003 |journal=J.

These holes in the ozone layer have the potential to expand to cover inhabited and vegetative regions of the planet, leading to catastrophic environmental damage.

Ozone destruction occurs principally in [[polar region]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.theozonehole.com/ozonedestruction.htm |title=The Ozone Hole-Ozone Destruction |accessdate=19 February 2009 |publisher=Theozonehole.com |author=Charles Welch }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the formation of ozone occurs principally in the [[tropics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.solcomhouse.com/ozone.htm |publisher=Solcomhouse.com |author=Charles Welch |accessdate=19 February 2009 |title=Ozone }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone is distributed around the planet by the [[Brewer-Dobson circulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/MAM/jones_Brewer_Dobson.pdf |format=PDF |title=Brewer-Dobson Circulation |author=Dylan Jones |work=GCC Summer School }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the source and dispersal pattern of aerosols is critical in understanding their effect on the ozone layer.

[[File:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpg|thumb|Turner was inspired by dramatic sunsets caused by volcanic aerosols]]

Aerosols scatter light, which affects the appearance of the sky and of [[sunset]]s. Changing the concentration of aerosols in the [[atmosphere]] can dramatically affect the appearance of [[sunset]]s. A change in sky appearance during 1816, [["The Year Without A Summer"]] (attributed to the eruption of [[Mount Tambora]]), was the inspiration for the paintings of [[J. M. W. Turner]]. Further volcanic eruptions and [[climate engineering|geoengineering]] projects involving sulfur aerosols are likely to affect the appearance of sunsets significantly,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |author=Olson, D.

Olson |date=February 2004 |title=When the sky ran red: The story behind The Scream |publisher=Sky &amp; Telescope |volume=107 |issue=2 |pages=29–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to create a haze in the sky.

Aerosol particles are eventually deposited from the stratosphere onto land and ocean. Depending on the volume of particles descending, the effects may be significant to ecosystems, or may not be. Modelling of the quantities of aerosols used in likely geoengineering scenarios suggest that effects on terrestrial ecosystems from deposition is not likely to be significantly harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite conference |bibcode=2008AGUFM.U43A0041K |title=Acid Deposition From Stratospheric Geoengineering With Sulfate Aerosols |author=Kravitz, B., A.

The ability of stratospheric sulfur aerosols to create this [[global dimming]] effect has made them a possible candidate for use in [[climate engineering]] projects to limit the effect and impact of [[climate change]] due to rising levels of [[greenhouse gases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.royalsociety.org/content/84j11614488142u8/ |journal=Phil.

The '''Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act of 2014''' ({{USBill|113|hr|4092}}) is a bill that would require the [[United States Department of Energy]] to establish a centralized clearinghouse to disseminate information on federal programs, incentives, and mechanisms for financing energy-efficient retrofits and upgrades at schools.&lt;ref name="cbo4092"/&gt; The bill would require the DOE to collect the data from all federal agencies and store it in one place online.&lt;ref name=LawmakersTackle&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marcos|first1=Cristina|title=Lawmakers to tackle energy bill, IRS emails|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/210125-lawmakers-to-tackle-energy-bills-and-irs-email-controversy|accessdate=23 June 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="4092sum"/&gt;

The bill was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=4092sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4092 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4092|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act of 2014 would amend the [[Energy Policy and Conservation Act]] to direct the [[United States Secretary of Energy]] ([[United States Department of Energy|DOE]]), acting through the [[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]], to act as the lead [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agency]] for coordinating and disseminating information on existing federal programs and assistance that may be used to help initiate, develop, and finance [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[renewable energy]], and energy retrofitting projects for schools.&lt;ref name="4092sum"/&gt;

The bill would require the Secretary to: (1) carry out a review of existing programs and financing mechanisms available in or from appropriate federal agencies with jurisdiction over energy financing and facilitation that are currently used or may be used for such purposes; (2) establish a federal cross-departmental collaborative coordination, education, and outreach effort to streamline communication and promote available federal opportunities and assistance for such projects that enables states, local educational agencies, and schools to use existing federal opportunities more effectively and to form partnerships with [[List of current United States governors|governors]], state energy programs, local educational, financial, and energy officials, state and local officials, nonprofit organizations, and other appropriate entities to support project initiation; (3) provide technical assistance for states, local educational agencies, and schools to help develop and finance projects that meet specified requirements; (4) develop and maintain a single online resource website with contact information for relevant technical assistance and support staff in the Office for states, local educational agencies, and schools to effectively access and use federal opportunities and assistance to develop such projects; and (5) establish a process for recognition of schools that have successfully implemented such projects and are willing to serve as resources for other local educational agencies and schools to assist initiation of similar efforts.&lt;ref name="4092sum"/&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on April 30, 2014. This is a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=cbo4092&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4092|url=http://cbo.gov/publication/45388|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

H.R. 4092 would require the Secretary of Energy to establish a centralized clearinghouse to disseminate information on federal programs, incentives, and mechanisms for financing energy-efficient retrofits and upgrades at schools. The bill would direct the Secretary to work with other federal agencies to develop a comprehensive list of such federal programs and to streamline efforts to publicize them through education and outreach.&lt;ref name="cbo4092"/&gt;

Based on information from the Department of Energy (DOE) about current levels of spending for similar efforts, the [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimates that enacting H.R. 4092 would not significantly affect the federal budget. We estimate that any additional costs incurred by DOE to expand existing efforts to promote opportunities to boost energy efficiency of schools under H.R. 4092 would total less than $500,000 annually, assuming the availability of appropriated funds. H.R. 4092 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, [[PAYGO|pay-as-you-go]] procedures do not apply.&lt;ref name="cbo4092"/&gt;

H.R. 4092 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]] and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.&lt;ref name="cbo4092"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act of 2014 was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on February 26, 2014 by [[Matt Cartwright|Rep. Matthew A. Cartwright (D, PA-17)]].&lt;ref name=4092allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4092 - All Actions|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4092/all-actions|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] and the [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power]]. The bill was scheduled to be voted on under a [[suspension of the rules]] on June 23, 2014.&lt;ref name="LawmakersTackle"/&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
Rep. Cartwright, who introduced the bill, argued that "the bill is a strategic and cost-saving investment to relieve the fiscal pressure felt by schools across the country while bringing us closer to energy security."&lt;ref name=SBCmagCommVote&gt;{{cite web|title=House Committee Unanimously Approves Energy Efficiency for Schools Act|url=http://www.sbcmag.info/news/2014/may/house-committee-unanimously-approves-energy-efficiency-schools-act|publisher=SBC Magazine|accessdate=23 June 2014|date=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright cited statistics from [[Energy Star]] indicating that schools in the United States spend $6 billion a year on energy bills, the second largest category of spending after personnel.&lt;ref name="SBCmagCommVote"/&gt;

[[ASHRAE]], formerly the "American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers", supported the bill.&lt;ref name="SBCmagCommVote"/&gt; The [[U.S. Green Building Council]] also supported the bill, saying that it "aims to make important improvements to existing federal policies."&lt;ref name=USGBCsupport&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howard|first1=Bryan|title=Efficiency bills march out of House committee|url=http://www.usgbc.org/articles/efficiency-bills-march-out-house-committee|publisher=U.S. Green Building Council|accessdate=23 June 2014|date=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sudden stratospheric warming''' (SSW) is an event in which the observed [[Stratosphere|stratospheric]] temperature rises by several tens of [[kelvin]]s (up to about 50 °C (90 °F)), over the course of a few days.&lt;ref name="Met Office"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sudden Stratospheric Warming|url=https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/learn-about-the-weather/how-weather-works/sudden-stratospheric-warming|accessdate=23 February 2018|work=Met Office|date=21 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change is preceded by a situation in which the [[Jet stream|Polar jet stream]] of westerly winds in the winter hemisphere is disturbed by natural weather patterns or disturbances in the lower atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What is sudden stratospheric warming (SSW)?|work=Met Éireann|url=http://www.met.ie/news/display.asp?ID=498|accessdate=23 February 2018|date=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first continuous measurements of the stratosphere were taken by Richard Scherhag in 1951. He used [[radiosondes]] to take reliable temperature readings in the upper [[stratosphere]] (~40&amp;nbsp;km). It was his persistence which led him to witness the first ever observed stratospheric warming on 27 January 1952. After his discovery, Scherhag assembled a team of [[meteorologists]] specifically to study the stratosphere at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. This group continued to map the northern-hemisphere stratospheric temperature and [[geopotential height]] for many years using [[radiosonde]]s and [[rocketsonde]]s. In 1979 when the [[satellite]] era began, meteorological measurements became far more frequent. Although [[satellite]]s were primarily used for the [[troposphere]] they also recorded data for the stratosphere. Today both [[satellite]]s and stratospheric [[radiosonde]]s are used to take measurements of the [[stratosphere]].

== Classification and description ==
Typically stratospheric [[meteorologists]] classify the vortex breakdown into three categories: major, minor, and final. No unambiguous
standard definition for major, minor, and final warmings has so far been adopted.&lt;ref name="Compendium"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=Amy H.|last2=Sjoberg|first2=Jeremiah P.|last3=Seidel|first3=Dian J.|last4=Rosenlof|first4=Karen H.|title=A sudden stratospheric warming compendium|journal=Earth System Science Data|date=9 February 2017|volume=9|issue=1|pages=63–76|doi=10.5194/essd-9-63-2017|bibcode=2017ESSD....9...63B}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Major SSWs occur when the winter polar stratospheric westerlies reverse to easterlies. In minor warmings, the polar temperature
gradient reverses but the circulation does not, and in final warmings, the vortex breaks down and remains easterly until the following boreal autumn".(Butler et al 2017)&lt;ref name="Compendium"/&gt;

Sometimes a fourth category, the Canadian warming, is included because of its unique and distinguishing structure and evolution.

"There are two main types of SSW: displacement events in which the stratospheric polar vortex is displaced from the pole and split events in which the vortex splits into two or more vortices. Some SSWs are a combination of both types". (Butler et al 2017).&lt;ref name="Compendium"/&gt;

=== Major ===
These occur when the westerly winds at 60N and 10hPa ([[geopotential height]]) reverse, i.e. become easterly. A complete disruption of the [[polar vortex]] is observed and the vortex will either be split into daughter vortices, or displaced from its normal location over the pole.

According to the [[World Meteorological Organization]]'s Commission for Atmospheric Sciences (Mclnturff, 1978): ''a stratospheric warming can be said to be major if at 10 mb or below the latitudinal mean temperature increases poleward from 60 degree latitude and an associated circulation reversal is observed (that is, the prevailing mean westerly winds poleward of 60 latitude are succeeded by mean easterlies in the same area).''

=== Minor ===
Minor warmings are similar to major warmings however they are less dramatic, the westerly winds are slowed, however do not reverse. Therefore a breakdown of the vortex is never observed.

Mclnturff  states: ''a stratospheric warming is called minor if a significant temperature increase is observed (that is, at least 25 degrees in a period of week or less) at any stratospheric level in any area of winter time hemisphere. The polar vortex is not broken down and the wind reversal from westerly to easterly is less extensive.''

=== Final ===
The radiative cycle in the [[stratosphere]] means that during winter the mean flow is westerly and during summer it is easterly (westward). A final warming occurs on this transition, so that the [[polar vortex]] winds change direction for the warming, however do not change back until the following winter. This is because the [[stratosphere]] has entered the summer easterly phase. It is final because another warming cannot occur over the summer, so it is the final warming of the current winter.

=== Canadian ===
Canadian warmings occur in early winter in the stratosphere of the Northern Hemisphere, typically from mid November to early December. They have no counterpart in the southern hemisphere.

== Dynamics ==
In a usual northern-hemisphere winter, several minor warming events occur, with a major event occurring roughly every two years.  One reason for major stratospheric warmings to occur in the Northern hemisphere is because [[orography]] and land-sea temperature contrasts are responsible for the generation of long ([[wavenumber]] 1 or 2) [[Rossby waves]] in the [[troposphere]]. These waves travel upward to the [[stratosphere]] and are dissipated there, decelerating the winds and warming the Arctic. This is the reason that major warmings are only observed in the northern-hemisphere, with one exception. In 2002 a southern-hemisphere major warming was observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02987584 |title=The southern hemisphere ozone hole split in 2002 |year=2002 |last1=Varotsos |first1=C. |journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=375-376 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1175/JAS-3313.1 |title=Simulations of Dynamics and Transport during the September 2002 Antarctic Major Warming |year=2005 |last1=Manney |first1=Gloria L. |last2=Sabutis |first2=Joseph L. |last3=Allen |first3=Douglas R. |last4=Lahoz |first4=William A. |last5=Scaife |first5=Adam A. |last6=Randall |first6=Cora E. |last7=Pawson |first7=Steven |last8=Naujokat |first8=Barbara |last9=Swinbank |first9=Richard |journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=690 |bibcode = 2005JAtS...62..690M }}&lt;/ref&gt; This event to date is not fully understood.

At an initial time a [[Block (meteorology)|blocking-type circulation pattern]] establishes in the troposphere. This blocking pattern causes{{clarify|date=September 2010}} Rossby waves with zonal wavenumber 1 and/or 2{{clarify|date=September 2010}} to grow to unusually large amplitudes. The growing wave propagates into the stratosphere and decelerates the mean zonal winds.{{clarify|date=September 2010}} Thus the [[polar night jet]] weakens and simultaneously becomes distorted by the growing planetary waves. Because the wave amplitude increases with decreasing density this easterly acceleration process is not effective at fairly high levels.{{why?|date=September 2010}} If the waves are sufficiently strong the mean zonal flow may decelerate sufficiently so that the winter westerlies turn easterly. At this point planetary waves may no longer penetrate into the stratosphere &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/JZ066i001p00083 |title=Propagation of planetary-scale disturbances from the lower into the upper atmosphere |year=1961 |last1=Charney |first1=J. G. |last2=Drazin |first2=P. G. |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=66 |pages=83|bibcode = 1961JGR....66...83C }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=September 2010}}). Hence further upward transfer of energy is completely blocked and a very rapid easterly deceleration and the polar warming occur at this critical level, which must then move downward until eventually the warming and zonal wind reversal affect the entire polar stratosphere.

There exists a link between sudden stratospheric warmings and the [[quasi-biennial oscillation]]:  If the QBO is in its easterly phase, the [[atmospheric waveguide]] is modified in such a way that upward-propagating [[Rossby waves]] are focused on the [[polar vortex]], intensifying their interaction with the mean flow.  Thus, there exists a statistically significant imbalance between the frequency of sudden stratospheric warmings if these events are grouped according to the QBO phase (easterly or westerly).

== Weather effects ==
Although sudden stratospheric warmings are mainly forced by planetary scale waves which propagate up from the lower atmosphere, there is also a subsequent return effect of sudden stratospheric warmings on surface weather.  Following a sudden stratospheric warming, the high altitude winds reverse to flow eastward instead of their usual westward.  The eastward winds progress down through the atmosphere and weaken the jet stream, often giving easterly winds near the surface and resulting in dramatic reductions in temperature in Europe. This process can take a few days to a few weeks to occur.&lt;ref name="Met Office"/&gt;

==Around the world==

On 27 September 2010, ''Tûranor PlanetSolar'' set off from [[Monaco]] to circumnavigate the globe solely with the aid of solar power. One aim of the project was to focus public awareness on the importance of renewable energies for environmental protection.

The boat had a crew of four. The expedition leader and founder of the PlanetSolar project Raphaël Domjan. The captain of the boat was Patrick Marchesseau, but at the midpoint of the circumnavigation (in New Caledonia in mid-May 2011) the French Canadian Erwann Le Rouzic took over as captain.

A significant stopover was [[Cancún]], [[Mexico]], during the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] held there from 29 November to 10 December 2010. During the expedition, ''Tûranor PlanetSolar'' broke two records: the fastest crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by solar boat and the longest distance ever covered by a solar electric vehicle. ''Tûranor PlanetSolar'' returned to Monaco on 4 May 2012 after 584 days sailing around the globe.

== 2013 voyage and transatlantic record ==

After an engine refit, ''Tûranor PlanetSolar'' broke its own record, crossing the Atlantic Ocean from  [[Las Palmas]] to [[Saint Martin]] in the Caribbean in only 22 days, four days faster than on the circumnavigation trip. The boat left Las Palmas on 25 April and arrived in [[Marigot, Saint Martin|Marigot]] on Saint Martin on 18 May The trip led to [[Miami]], Florida, and then continued as a scientific expedition along the [[Gulf Stream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PlanetSolar - four days faster across the Atlantic|url=http://www.sail-world.com/Australia/PlanetSolar---four-days-faster-across-the-Atlantic/109618|accessdate=19 May 2013|newspaper=Sail World|date=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the return trip the boat reached St John's, Newfoundland, on 1 August 2013 before heading back across the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thetelegram.com/News/Local/2013-08-02/article-3336478/Solar-ship-visits-St.-Johns/1 |title=Solar ship visits St. John's |first=Rhonda |last=Hayward |date=2 August 2013 |work=[[The Telegram]] |accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
