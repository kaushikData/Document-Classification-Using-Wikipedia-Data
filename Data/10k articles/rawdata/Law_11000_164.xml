The '''All Circuit Review Extension Act''' ({{USBill|113|hr|4197}}; {{uspl|113|170}}) is a bill that would extend for three years the authority for federal employees who appeal a judgment of the [[Merit Systems Protection Board]] (MSPB) to file their appeal at any federal court, instead of only the [[United States courts of appeals|U.S. Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref name="cbo4197"/&gt; This was a pilot program established in the [[Whistleblower Protection Act#Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act and Presidential Policy Directive 19|Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012]] to last only two years.

The bill was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]]. The bill was signed into law.

==Background==
The pilot program was established in the [[Whistleblower Protection Act#Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act and Presidential Policy Directive 19|Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012]] (WPEA) to last only two years. The [[Government Accountability Project]] (GAP) calls the program "landmark" and says that it was "the WPEA's most significant structural reform."&lt;ref name=GAPpendLeg&gt;{{cite web|title=Pending Legislation|url=http://www.whistleblower.org/pending-legislation|publisher=Government Accountability Project|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=4197sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4197 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4197|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The All Circuit Review Extension Act would extend from two to five years after the effective date of the [[Whistleblower Protection Act#Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act and Presidential Policy Directive 19|Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012]] (i.e., December 27, 2012), the period allowed for: (1) filing a petition for judicial review of [[Merit Systems Protection Board]] decisions in [[whistleblower]] cases, and (2) any review of such a decision by the Director of the [[Office of Personnel Management]] (OPM).&lt;ref name="4197sum"/&gt;

==Congressional Budget Office report==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], as ordered reported by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on March 12, 2014. This is a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=cbo4197&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4197|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45233|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimates that enacting H.R. 4197 would have no significant effect on the federal budget. The legislation could affect direct spending by agencies not funded through the annual appropriations (such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]); therefore, [[PAYGO|pay-as-you-go]] procedures apply. CBO estimates, however, that any net increase in spending by those agencies would not be significant. Enacting the bill would not affect revenues.&lt;ref name="cbo4197"/&gt;

H.R. 4197 would extend for three years the authority for federal employees who appeal a judgment of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) to file their appeal at any federal court, instead of only the [[United States courts of appeals|U.S. Court of Appeals]]. Based on information from MSPB and the [[United States Office of Special Counsel|Office of Special Counsel]], CBO expects that allowing appeals to be filed in any federal circuit would lead to a small increase in the administrative burden of the MSPB and federal agencies. We estimate, however, that the costs associated with that increase would not be significant.&lt;ref name="cbo4197"/&gt;

H.R. 4197 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the [[Unfunded Mandates Reform Act]] and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments.&lt;ref name="cbo4197"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The Al Circuit Review Extension Act was introduced on March 11, 2014 by [[Elijah Cummings|Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D, MD-7)]].&lt;ref name=4197allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4197 - All Actions|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4197/all-actions|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]], the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]], and the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law]]. On July 14, 2014, it was reported alongside House Report 113-519 part 1.&lt;ref name="4197allactions"/&gt; The House voted on July 14, 2014 to pass the bill in a [[voice vote]].&lt;ref name="4197allactions"/&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
The organization [[Government Accountability Project]] (GAP) supported the legislation, arguing that an extension of the pilot program was needed in order to ensure that the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) and Congress had enough time to see the results of the program before deciding whether to make it permanent.&lt;ref name="GAPpendLeg"/&gt;

[[Federal Employed Women]] (FEW) and the [[Make It Safe Coalition]] supported the passage of the bill. They argued that "all circuit review is a sorely needed provision to ensure that the WPEA is enforced as Congress intended" because "during its 1982-2012 monopoly the Federal Circuit rewrote and gutted congressionally-passed whistleblower rights repeatedly."&lt;ref name=FEWsupport&gt;{{cite web|title=Coalition Applauds Committee Vote to Extend Whistleblower Rights|url=https://www.few.org/coalition-applauds-committee-vote-extend-whistleblower-rights/|publisher=Federally Employed Women|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coalition reported that "the Federal Circuit had a 3-226 record against whistleblowers for decisions on the merits since October 1994, making it all but impossible for a whistleblower to prevail in court."&lt;ref name="FEWsupport"/&gt;

Rep. Elijah Cummings, who introduced the bill, said that this program is important to extend because it "allows whistleblowers to file appeals where they live rather than being limited to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals."&lt;ref name=CommitPR1&gt;{{cite web|title=Oversight Committee Passes Bipartisan Bills to Improve Federal Worker Savings, Whistleblower Protections|url=http://oversight.house.gov/release/oversight-committee-passes-bipartisan-bills-improve-federal-worker-savings-whistleblower-protections/|publisher=House Committee on Oversight &amp; Government Reform|accessdate=15 July 2014|date=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has "an abysmal track record in whistleblower cases."&lt;ref name="CommitPR1"/&gt;

Rep. [[Darrell Issa]] also supported the bill, arguing that "whistleblowers are a critical asset for congressional oversight" and that extending the pilot program would give Congress "more time to gauge the impact of an 'all circuit' review."&lt;ref name="CommitPR1"/&gt;

The '''Asia Cup Moot''', or '''Asia Cup''' in short, is an annual international [[moot court]] competition that is open to law schools in Asia. The competition inaugurated in 1999 and is held in Tokyo, Japan. It is jointly organised by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan]] and the International Law Students Exchange Council, and the moot problem typically contains issues pertaining to [[public international law]], [[international humanitarian law]], and [[international human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mofa.go.jp/announce/event/2005/8/0801.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smu.edu.sg/sites/default/files/smu/news_room/smu_in_the_news/2011/sources/ST_20110902_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smu.edu.sg/sites/default/files/smu/news_room/smu_in_the_news/2014/sources/aug25/ST_20140823_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.np.emb-japan.go.jp/ann/070213.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hukumonline.com/berita/baca/lt522de429c303b/fh-unpad-sabet-dua-gelar-di-asia-cup&lt;/ref&gt; The top 10–12 scoring teams for the memorials qualify for the international rounds in Tokyo, but generally each country except Japan is only permitted to send one team.&lt;ref&gt;http://kokusaiho.aquasky.jp/en/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Each team may feature up to four oralists. As of 2017, 45 different law schools have competed in Tokyo since the moot's inception.

For some schools, the moot (as is the Red Cross International Humanitarian Law Moot in Hong Kong) is seen as a rite of passage for Asian mooters before they go on to participate in the larger international moots, such as the [[Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition|Jessup Moot]] and [[Willem C. Vis Moot|Vis Moot]]. 

[[National University of Singapore Faculty of Law|National University of Singapore]] is the most successful schools winning six championships. The Philippines and Singapore, with nine wins each, are the winningest countries. Since 2010, Singapore has dominated the moot, with NUS taking the last three championships, and [[SMU School of Law|Singapore Management University]] reaching the international finals six years in a row between 2010 and 2015—winning three—and having 12 of its oralists ranked in the top 5 for Best Oralist.

'''Association of Judicial Unity (YBD)'''
[jbd̪] is the largest association of judges and [[public prosecutor]]s in [[Turkey]]. YBD’s origins date back to the Platform of the Judicial Unity created in 2014 by judges and prosecutors from all political horizons, philosophical convictions and religious beliefs. Ensuring the same spirit of heterogeneity, YBD has obtained the legal status of association on March 27, 2015.&lt;ref name="ybd.org.tr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ybd.org.tr/en/ybd-hakkinda/tarihce|title=Yargıda Birlik Derneği is under construction|website=www.ybd.org.tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haber7.com/hukuk/haber/1331389-yargida-birlik-platformu-dernek-oldu|title=Yargıda Birlik Platformu dernek oldu|first=|last=Haber7|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ulusalkanal.com.tr/gundem/yargida-birlik-dernegi-kuruldu-h54664.html|title=Yargıda Birlik Derneği kuruldu haberi - Son Dakika Haberleri|first=Ulusal|last=Kanal|website=www.ulusalkanal.com.tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Founded in 2014 by members of the judiciary concerned about the future of the judicial system in Turkey, the Platform of the Judicial Unity has evolved to become the Association of Judicial Unity on March 27, 2015. The conception bringing the platform into existence has been maintained during the creation of YBD. The members of YBD undertake to make efforts in order to protect the independence and impartiality of the judiciary and thus preserving the public trust in the judiciary by taking a stance equidistant to all kinds of political opinions, philosophical or religious beliefs and convictions.

YBD’s first General Assembly meeting was held on September 12, 2015.&lt;ref name="ybd.org.tr"/&gt;

== Aims and vision ==
According to the Charter, YBD’s objectives and principles can be summarized as follows;
  
The [[Rule of Law]], which is one of the fundamental values of modern [[democracy]], will only be possible with a strong judicial power. Such a strong judicial power requires ensuring the independence, impartiality and accountability of the judiciary. In this connection, independence of the judiciary, which is a prerequisite for the rule of law, serves as a guarantee for the right to a fair trial and also as a fundamental guarantee of a democratic society. The notion of independence, which finds its meaning in the Constitution and which is also mentioned in the international instruments, makes it essential that one acts in accordance with the Constitution and the laws and only and solely on his/her personal conviction and that no adherence to any other person, institution or formation is allowed. Independence from the public opinion and non-judicial government institutions must be ensured and maintained. Independence must be secured within the judiciary as well.

The notion of impartiality refers to the necessity that members of the judiciary must, in compliance with the law without any influence during the decision-making processes, adopt an equitable approach to parties. Accordingly, it is incumbent on the State to enable the execution of judicial activities without any inherent fear or distress, and judges and prosecutors have also their share of responsibility in this regard. 
Another issue of importance as for a democratic rule of law is the accountability and transparency. Independence and impartiality could develop into an identity, which is in conformity with democracy, only through the mechanisms of accountability.

The Association of Judicial Unity ("YBD") has emerged as a civil initiative of the members of the judiciary with a view to exerting efforts in this regard. The understanding bringing YBD into existence is to protect the [[Judicial independence|independence]] and impartiality of the judiciary and thus to maintain the public trust in the judiciary, without adopting any political stance and by avoiding from political disputes. 
YBD has aimed to provide all kinds of efforts for a judicial administration which would afford a working environment free from threats and oppression within the judiciary; eliminate and satisfy all of the concerns and expectations as regards the issues of assignment, transfer, authorization, promotion and inspection; and adopt an approach responsive to individual or family-related requests of members of the judiciary.  
YBD will carry out works with a view to developing an effective and well-functioning judiciary system which has internalized the human rights and which takes as basis only the public trust and public satisfaction. It will also observe the satisfaction of members of the judiciary and judicial staff. In this context, activities will be carried out for the purposes of ensuring that the judiciary system adopts new practices, that the working conditions are improved, that the judiciary comes to a point which enables it to cope with the case-load and that the communication between judicial institutions and other judicial actors is improved; and proposals will be developed in order to achieve judicial excellence.

The main character of this formation consists of a participatory approach and an understanding of taking a stance equidistant to all kinds of political opinions, philosophical or religious beliefs and convictions. The pre-eminence of the rights and the rule of law are the indispensable aims pursued by YBD. The members of YBD undertake to make efforts in order to maintain this structure, and to observe the independence and impartiality of the judiciary as well as the tenure of judges.

YBD will conduct its works by taking the following instruments as basis: the [[Constitution of Turkey|Constitution of the Republic of Turkey]], the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the United Nations Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, the United Nations Principles on the Role of Prosecutors, the Council of Europe Recommendation on Independence, Efficiency and Role of Judges; the European Charter on the Statute for Judges, the United Nations Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct; Recommendations of the Committee of Minister of the Council of Europe and the Consultative Council of European Judges (CCJE), the Universal Charter of the Judge, the [[Budapest Principles]] adopted for prosecutors, the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] (UNCAC), the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption, and other relevant international instruments and standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ybd.org.tr/en/ybd-hakkinda/misyon-ve-vizyon|title=Yargıda Birlik Derneği is under construction|website=www.ybd.org.tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Augusto Antonio Barbera''' (born 25 June 1938) is an Italian judge and former [[constitutional law]] professor at the [[University of Bologna]]. In his political career he was member of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] between 1976 and 1994 for the [[Italian Communist Party]] and later the [[Democratic Party of the Left]]. In 1993 he served shortly as Minister without portfolio for relations with Parliament in the government of Prime Minister [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]]. Barbera has been Judge of the [[Constitutional Court of Italy]] since 21 December 2015.

==Career==
Barbera was born in [[Aidone]] on 25 June 1938.&lt;ref name=court&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/ActionPagina_321.do |title=The Constitutional Court: Composition of the Court |publisher=Constitutional Court of Italy |date= |accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained a degree in Jurisprudence with a specialization in constitutional law. Between 1967 and 1969 he worked abroad as a researcher at the universities of [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology|Karlsruhe]] and [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]].&lt;ref name=criscuolo&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cortecostituzionale.it/documenti/interventi_presidente/Criscuolo_laudatio3_bis.pdf |title=Discurso di benvenuto del Presidente dott. Allesandro Criscuolo ai Giudici constituzionali Franco Modugno, Augusto Barbera, Giulio Prosperetti |language=Italian |publisher=Constitutional Court of Italy |date= |accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbera was a lecturer of constitutional law at the [[University of Catania]] from 1969 to 1970. He then took up similar position at the [[University of Ferrara]], where he would remain until 1977. In that latter year he started working at the Institute of Public Law of the faculty of political science of the [[University of Bologna]]. He stopped working there in 1994.&lt;ref name=criscuolo/&gt; He was a professor of constitutional law at the University of Bologna.&lt;ref name=criscuolo/&gt; He took up [[emeritus]] status in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.magazine.unibo.it/archivio/2015/12/18/il-professor-augusto-barbera-alla-consulta-eletto-giudice-costituzionale |title=Il professor Augusto Barbera alla Consulta: eletto giudice costituzionale |language=Italian |publisher=Unibo Magazine |date=18 December 2015 |accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Barbera was named as one of 35 academics in a commission on constitutional reform under Prime Minister [[Enrico Letta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bolognatoday.it/cronaca/augusto-barbera-corte-costituzionale-prof-universita-bologna.html |title=Augusto Barbera, professore emerito di Alma Mater, eletto membro della Corte Costituzionale |language=Italian |publisher=Bologna Today |date=17 December 2015 |accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.federalismi.it/document/04062013235208.pdf |title=Elenco dei componenti della Commissione per le Riforme Constituzionali nominata dal President del Consiglio Enrico Letta |language=Italian |publisher=Federalismi |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbera is a corresponding academic of the [[Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna]] in the section of law, economics, and finance.&lt;ref name=criscuolo/&gt;

==Political career==
Barbera took up political office in 1976, when he was elected to the [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] for the [[Italian Communist Party]]. He would stay member of the Chamber until 1994. When the Communist Party dissolved in 1991, he stayed member of its successor party, the [[Democratic Party of the Left]]. From 1987 to 1992 Barbera served as president of the parliamentary committee on regional questions.&lt;ref name=rai&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.rainews.it/dl/rainews/articoli/Consulta-chi-sono-i-3-nuovi-giudici-che-hanno-rottamato-il-patto-del-Nazareno-4c27cd0d-4bc9-47ae-94a0-1393bc5d96ff.html?refresh_ce |title=Consulta, chi sono i 3 nuovi giudici che hanno 'rottamato' il patto del Nazareno |language=Italian |publisher=RAI News |date=17 December 2015 |accessdate=4 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 April 1993 Barbera was one of three former Communist Party politicians named in the new [[Ciampi Cabinet]]; the other two were [[Vincenzo Visco]] and [[Luigi Berlinguer]].&lt;ref name=indep/&gt; Barbera was made Minister without portfolio for relations with Parliament. It was the first time in 46 years that former Communist Party politicians were made part of the cabinet.&lt;ref name=indep&gt;{{cite web|author=Patricia Clough |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ex-communists-join-italys-reform-government-the-non-political-prime-minister-puts-together-a-mould-1458094.html |title=Ex-Communists join Italy's reform government: The non-political Prime Minister puts together a mould-breaking cabinet |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |date=29 April 1993 |accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several hours after being officially named in the government, a rupture broke in the coalition over the handling of charges in Parliament against former Prime Minister [[Bettino Craxi]]. The Ministers of the Democratic Party of the Left, to which Barbera belonged, resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William D.

On 16 December 2015, the [[Italian Parliament]] elected three candidates to the [[Constitutional Court of Italy]]: [[Franco Modugno]], [[Giulio Prosperetti]] and Barbera.

The '''Black Women's Defense League''' (BWDL) is a [[self-defense]] organization based in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ypqy9w/this-group-of-black-women-is-taking-up-arms-to-fight-racism-and-misogyny|title=This Group of Black Women Is Taking Up Arms to Fight Racism and Misogyny|date=February 9, 2017|accessdate=September 3, 2017|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|first=Wilbert L.|last=Cooper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The BWDL was founded in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/27/black-women-guns-classes-racism-trump|title=More black women are learning to use guns: 'this is a movement, and it starts now'|date=April 27, 2017|accessdate=September 3, 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Timothy|last=Pratt}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Niecee X.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt; She was influenced by groups including the [[Huey P. Newton Gun Club]] but later split from them.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt; 

The BWDL describes itself as a [[Womanist]] organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blavity.com/the-black-womens-defense-league-stands-its-ground-at-the-intersection-of-race-and-feminism|title=How The Black Women's Defense League Is Confronting Racism and Misogny Head-On|date=February 2017|accessdate=September 3, 2017|work=[[Blavity]]|first=Ebony|last=F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the group's [[Facebook]] page, it "works for the immediate pursuit of an [[intersectional]], safe, and free society" and "organizes to provide immediate protection and services to Black Women and those most marginalized by [[White Supremacy]]."&lt;ref name=sanoff&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hellogiggles.com/news/politics/niecee-x-farmer-mai-america-dreaming/|title=These women are fighting to make the American Dream a reality for everyone|date=July 17, 2018|accessdate=August 6, 2018|work=[[HelloGiggles]]|first=Rachel|last=Sanoff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group provides [[self-defense]] and arms training to "abused, underserved black women and marginalized genders",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/fascinating-history-of-leftist-self-defense|title=The long, fascinating history of leftist self-defense|date=July 28, 2017|accessdate=September 3, 2017|work=[[Pacific Standard]]|first=Elizabeth|last=King}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also engages in political education, charity work and youth outreach work.&lt;ref name=sanoff/&gt;

==Activities==

In January 2017 BWDL members attended the [[2017 Women's March|Women's March]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;

In September 2017 the group was involved in relief efforts in [[Houston]], [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]] and [[Beaumont, Texas]], following [[Hurricane Harvey]].&lt;ref name=sanoff/&gt;&lt;ref name=gosztola&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shadowproof.com/2017/09/10/unauthorized-disclosure-episode-31-black-women-hurricane-harvey-relief/|title=After hurricane, Black Women's Defense League focuses on relief for communities of color in Houston|date=September 10, 2017|accessdate=September 13, 2017|work=[[ShadowProof]]|first=Kevin|last=Gosztola}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inthesetimes.com/article/20522/hurricane-harvey-houstin-leftist-mutual-aid-redneck-revolt|title=Leftists to the Rescue: Where the State and Big NGOs Fail, Mutual Aid Networks Step In|date=September 14, 2017|accessdate=September 16, 2017|work=[[In These Times]]|first=Jared|last=Ware}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Its activities focused on groups otherwise overlooked by relief organizations and those excluded by shelters.&lt;ref name=gosztola/&gt;

In December 2017 the BWDL organised a protest against a concert by [[R. Kelly]] in Dallas due to accusations of sexual misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox4news.com/news/womens-group-wants-r-kelly-concert-in-dallas-canceled|title=Women's group wants R-Kelly concert in Dallas canceled|date=November 27, 2017|accessdate=August 5, 2018|publisher=[[KDFW|Fox 4]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cw39.com/2017/12/05/r-kelly-greeted-by-protesters-at-dallas-concert/|title=R.

In May 2018 the BWDL was featured in a documentary produced by [[Pabst Blue Ribbon]], which sought to celebrate "the voices of today's ever-evolving [[American dream]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mic.com/articles/189464/pabst-blue-ribbon-is-the-latest-brand-to-wade-into-the-world-of-vague-political-messaging|title=Pabst Blue Ribbon is the latest brand to wade into the world of vague political messaging|date=May 23, 2018|accessdate=August 6, 2018|work=[[Mic (media company)|Mic]]|first=Kate|last=Bratskeir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bodleian Law Library''' ('''BLL''') is an [[academic library]] in [[Oxford]], England.&lt;ref name="hibbert"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[The Encyclopaedia of Oxford]] | publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] | chapter=Law Library | year=1988 | page=216 | isbn=0-333-39917-X | editor-last=Hibbert |editor-first=Christopher |editor-link=Christopher Hibbert }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of [[Oxford University]], the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian Libraries]] and is also the library of the Faculty of Law. It is situated in part of the [[listed building|Grade II*-listed]] St Cross Building&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buildingcentre.co.uk/case_study/st-cross-building-oxford|title=St Cross Building, Oxford|website=''buildingcentre.co.uk''|access-date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[St Cross Road]] in the parish of [[Holywell, Oxford|Holywell]], on the corner of [[Manor Road, Oxford|Manor Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/about-us/about-faculty/st-cross-building|title=St Cross Building|website=Oxford Law Faculty|access-date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The library is one of the largest open-access law libraries in Europe.{{fact|date=October 2014}} Opened in 1964, it now{{when|date=October 2014}} contains over 450,000 volumes on 16,000 linear metres of shelving, and is housed in purpose-built library accommodation designed by the distinguished architects [[Sir Leslie Martin]] and [[Colin St John Wilson]].

The BLL benefits from the Bodleian's status as a library of [[legal deposit]], by which the BLL has the right to claim a copy of any printed legal material published in the United Kingdom or Ireland. Together with its position as an official Documentation Centre for the [[European Union]] and its significant expenditure on foreign legal materials, this means that the BLL adds more than 10,000 new items to its stock each year.

The BLL serves a wide and expanding range of university and external readers.{{fact|date=October 2014}} Its primary 'client' base is the [[University of Oxford]]'s Faculty of Law which, with over 1,100 undergraduate and postgraduate students and 80 academic staff, is the largest law faculty in the United Kingdom. At the same time, and because of its legal deposit status, the BLL is also used extensively by legal firms, lawyers, and individual researchers from both home and abroad. 

The BLL collection supports the teaching and research of Law at the University of Oxford, and shares Criminology and Socio-Legal Studies with the [[Social Science Library, Oxford|Social Science Library]]. The St Cross Building is adjacent to the Social Science Building in Manor Road, which houses the Social Sciences departments, including the Economics Department, as well as the Social Science Library.

==Collection==
The BLL collection has been built up over a period of four centuries, both from the legal deposit intake, and from specific purchases based on recommendations from academics and researchers alike.{{fact|date=October 2014}} The core primary legal materials for the UK, the Commonwealth countries, the US, the EU, individual European countries, and international law are collected on an ongoing basis, together with key legal texts for all jurisdictions. The BLL holds full sets of previous editions of major UK legal monographs on the open shelves.

It receives over 2,000 [[periodical publication|serial]] titles per annum, including law reports, legislation, journals and looseleaf services from all the jurisdictions held in the collection.{{fact|date=October 2014}} The BLL holds several special collections, including rare books, the Viner collection, the Bandar Collection of [[Islamic Law]], and the Kahn-Freund collection of [[labour law]] material.

Readers have access to all leading UK legal databases, together with a large number of foreign legal databases, supporting the research undertaken by members of the faculty.{{fact|date=October 2014}} Network printing, scanning and photocopying are provided.

==Facilities==
[[File:Main Reading Room, Bodleian Law Library, University of Oxford - 20081018.jpg|thumb|Main Reading Room.]]
The BLL was designed to hold the law collection of the Bodleian Library on open access shelves, ensuring ready access at all times to scholars.{{fact|date=October 2014}} Seating is provided for 430 readers, with over one third of seats reserved for postgraduate student use. 

There is a Graduate Reading Room.{{fact|date=October 2014}} This area occupies a separate wing, and provides students with [[ethernet]] access, several PCs, and wireless access for laptops.

The BLL has a total of 40 [[Personal computer|PCs]] for reader use.{{fact|date=October 2014}}{{when|date=October 2014}} The PCs in the Freshfields IT room on the lower floor and in the Gallery computer room require readers to log in, but there are a few PCs for searching the catalogue on each floor. Wireless access for laptop computers is provided throughout most areas of the library and is accessed using the same login as the library PCs.

The Baker McKenzie room is available for student use for group discussion, as well as {{linktext|carrel}} facilities which are offered on a shared basis.{{fact|date=October 2014}}

==Legal research==
The Law Library staff provide an extensive teaching programme to all postgraduate and undergraduate students. The Legal Research Skills Programme is a compulsory first year subject for undergraduates;{{fact|date=October 2014}} all postgraduates are provided with detailed library induction, as well as a wide range of research classes offered each term. Legal information guides to specific countries and to legal subjects is available in leaflet form.{{fact|date=July 2009}}

'''''Bunning v Cross''''' [1978] [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1978/22.html HCA 22], 141 CLR 54 (HCA), is an [[Australia]]n [[evidence (law)|evidence law]] case, in which the admissibility of improperly gained evidence is examined. Like the similar ''R v Ireland'' (1970) 126 CLR 321, ''Bunning v Cross'', the ruling of the [[High Court of Australia]] has been formulated as an [[exclusionary rule]], namely the onus is on the accused to prove the misconduct and justify exclusion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/pdo/ll_pdo.nsf/vwPrint1/PDO_confessionalevidence|title=Confessional Evidence|first=Peter|last=Zahra|publisher=Public Defender's Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is known as the Bunning discretion (cf. Ireland discretion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/16.%20Discretionary%20and%20Mandatory%20Exclusions/exclusion-improperly-or-illegally-obtained-e|title=Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence|publisher=Australian Law Reform Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Bates. (1994.) "Improperly Obtained Evidence and Public Policy: An Australian Perspective", ''The International and Comparative Law Quarterly'', 43(2):379-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
Mr. Bunning was charged under s. 63 (1) of the ''Road Traffic Act, 1974'' with having driven a car "whilst under the influence of alcohol to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of it". Burton [[wiktionary:stipendiary|S]][[wiktionary:magistrate|M]] dismissed the charge, holding that the evidence of the result of a breathalyzer test was inadmissible because the police officer's requirement that the applicant undergo the test was unlawful.

The respondent (i.e., Cross, the prosecutor) sought and obtained an order to review from the [[Supreme Court of Western Australia]] under the ''Justices Act 1902'' (WA), as amended. The relevant provisions (ss. 197, 198, 205, 206, 206A and 206F) are set out in the judgment of the Chief Justice. Jones J heard the return to the order and decided that the evidence was admissible but that, in the circumstances, the magistrate was entitled in his discretion to admit or to reject it. Jones J declined to direct that the evidence should be admitted, but expressed the view that, if he were to decide the question for himself, he would admit it. He then made an order directing the magistrate to rehear the case and to determine it "in accordance with this judgment and according to law". This can only mean (and s. 206F makes this clear) that the magistrate was bound to follow Jones J's directions.

Burton SM reheard the case, treated the evidence of the breathalyzer test as admissible, and, in his discretion, rejected the evidence. He then dismissed the charge for the second time.

The respondent sought and obtained another order to review on the ground that the magistrate had not properly exercised his discretion. The Full Court (Lavan and Brinsden JJ, Burt CJ dissenting) held that the discretion was not properly exercised. Burt CJ held that the magistrate took into account all relevant matters. Lavan J took the view that Mr. Burton had not taken into account all relevant considerations and directed that he should reconsider the exercise of discretion. Brinsden J considered that the magistrate was bound to admit the evidence and thought the result should be a conviction. None of the justices of the Full Court was willing to exercise the discretion to admit or exclude the evidence, and none was willing that the Full Court should convict (although urged to do so by the respondent). They also refrained from directing the magistrate to convict.

==Judgment==

===Majority opinion===
Barwick CJ authored a [[concurring opinion]], and Stephen and Aickin JJ co-authored a concurring opinion. The majority ruled for the applicant, the prosecutor, and ordered the case to be remitted to the magistrate, who was directed to convict the respondent and impose upon the respondent an appropriate penalty.

===Dissenting opinion===
Jacobs and Murphy JJ both authored individual [[dissenting opinion]]s.

The '''Cartagena Declaration on Refugees''', or just '''Cartagena Declaration''', is a non-binding regional, i.e. Latin-American, instrument for the protection of refugees and was adopted in 1984 by delegates from 10 Latin-American countries: Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama and Venezuela. The Declaration was since incorporated in national laws and state practice of 14 countries.

The declaration is the result of the "Colloquium on International Protection for Refugees and Displaced Persons in Central America, Mexico and Panama", which was held in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Colombia]] from 19 to 22 November 1984. The Declaration was influenced by the "[[Contadora group|Contadora Act on Peace and Cooperation]]", which itself was based on the [[1951 Refugee Convention]] and the [[1967 Protocol]].

The Declaration reaffirms the importance of the right to [[Right of asylum|asylum]], the principle of [[non-refoulement]] and the importance of finding [[Refugee#Durable solutions|durable solutions]].&lt;ref name="refugeelegalaidinformation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refugeelegalaidinformation.org/cartagena-declaration-refugees|publisher=refugeelegalaidinformation.org|title=Cartagena Declaration on Refugees &amp;#124; Rights in Exile Programme|accessdate=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unhcr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/protection/expert/53bd4d0c9/summary-conclusions-interpretation-extended-refugee-definition-1984-cartagena.html|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|publisher=unhcr.org|title=UNHCR&amp;nbsp;- Summary Conclusions on the interpretation of the extended refugee definition in the 1984 Cartagena Declaration|accessdate=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

=== Extended refugee definition===
Compared to the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol the Cartagena Declaration allows a broader category of persons in need of international protection to be considered as refugees. The Declaration, in Conclusion III, adds five situational events to the definition of the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol. Similar additions were made in the [[1969 Refugee Convention]], but the Cartagena Declaration has further extended them. Refugees are those:

: "persons who have fled their country because their lives, security or freedom have been threatened by generalized violence, foreign aggression, internal conflicts, massive violation of human rights or other circumstances which have seriously disturbed public order".

This definition allows a broader temporal and geographical scope for the risks refugees find themselves in and additionally covers some of the indirect effects such as poverty, economic decline, inflation, violence, disease, food insecurity, malnourishment and displacement.&lt;ref name="unhcr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/protection/expert/53bd4d0c9/summary-conclusions-interpretation-extended-refugee-definition-1984-cartagena.html|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|publisher=unhcr.org|title=UNHCR&amp;nbsp;- Summary Conclusions on the interpretation of the extended refugee definition in the 1984 Cartagena Declaration|accessdate=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Improved cooperation between countries ===

The Cartagena Declaration was the beginning of an ongoing forum between Latin American countries. Since 1984 the signatories of the declaration meet again every 10 years and they have even extended its reach to include Caribbean countries. Three successor declarations were made: the 1994 San José Declaration, the 2004 Mexico Declaration and the 2014 Brazil Declaration (with 28 countries and three territories of Latin America and the Caribbean). No other continent or region has such a forum.&lt;ref name="fmreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmreview.org/climatechange-disasters/maldonadocastillo.html|publisher=fmreview.org|title=The Cartagena process: 30 years of innovation and solidarity &amp;#124; Forced Migration Review|accessdate=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minors==
{{see also|Corporal punishment in the home|School corporal punishment}}
English [[common law]] allowed parents and others who have "lawful control or charge" of a child to use "moderate and reasonable" chastisement or correction. In the 1860 [[Eastbourne manslaughter]] case, [[Sir Alexander Cockburn, 12th Baronet|Alexander Cockburn]] as [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Chief Justice]] ruled: "By the law of England, a parent ... may for the purpose of correcting what is evil in the child, inflict moderate and reasonable corporal punishment, always, however, with this condition, that it is moderate and reasonable." It was left to the courts to decide what is meant by "moderate and reasonable" in any particular case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/progress/reports/uk.html# |title=Lawfulness of corporal punishment |access-date=2010-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406023038/http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/progress/reports/uk.html# |archive-date=2010-04-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rights of parents, guardians and teachers, in regard to the chastisement of children, were expressly recognized in English law by the [[Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act]] 1904 (§ 28). A master had a right to inflict moderate chastisement upon his [[apprentice]] for neglect or other misbehaviour, provided that he did so himself, and that the apprentice was under age (Archbold, Cr. Pl., 23rd ed., 795).&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 189"&gt;{{ EB1911 |inline=1 |wstitle=Corporal Punishment |volume=7 |page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England and Wales]], section 58 of the [[Children Act 2004]] enables parents to justify [[common assault]] or [[battery (crime)]] of their children as "reasonable punishment", but prevents the defence being used in relation to [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] (i.e. when causing anything beyond "transient and trifling" such as bruising) and any more serious harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/progress/reports/uk.html# |title=Lawfulness of corporal punishment |access-date=2010-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406023038/http://www.endcorporalpunishment.org/pages/progress/reports/uk.html# |archive-date=2010-04-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[law in the Republic of Ireland]], the [[rule of law]] allowing "physical chastisement" by teachers was abolished in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1997/act/26/section/24/enacted/en/html#sec24|title=Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, Section 24|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the common-law defence of "reasonable chastisement" by parents and guardians was abolished in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;

[[William Blackstone]] wrote in the 18th century in the [[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-115.htm William Blackstone. Commentaries on the Laws of England]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The husband also (by the old law) might give his wife moderate correction. For, as he is to answer for her misbehaviour, the law thought it reasonable to entrust him with the power of restraining her, by domestic chastisement.... But, with us, in the politer reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles the Second]], this power of correction began to be doubted: and a wife may now have security of the peace against her husband; or, in return, a husband against his wife....Yet the lower rank of people, who were always fond of the old common law, still claim and exert their ancient privilege: and the courts of law will still permit a husband to restrain a wife of her liberty, in case of any gross misbehavior.}}

In the UK the traditional right of a husband to inflict moderate corporal punishment on his wife in order to keep her "within the bounds of duty" was similarly removed in 1891.&lt;ref name="Chisholm 1911, p. 189"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lawteacher.net/family-law-resources/domestic-violence.php |title=R. v Jackson [1891] 1 QB 671, (abstract) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907012332/http://www.lawteacher.net/family-law-resources/domestic-violence.php |archive-date=7 September 2014 |website=LawTeacher.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1870s, courts in the United States overruled the common-law principle that a husband had the right to "physically chastise an errant wife".&lt;ref&gt;Calvert, R.

The '''Constitution of the Year VIII''' ({{lang-fr|Constitution de l'an VIII}} or {{lang-fr|Constitution du 22 frimaire an VIII}}) was a national [[constitution]] of [[France]], adopted on December 24, 1799 (during the Year VIII of the [[French Revolutionary Calendar]]), which established the form of government known as the [[French Consulate|Consulate]]. The [[coup d'etat|coup]] of [[18 Brumaire]] (November 9, 1799) had effectively given all power to [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], and in the eyes of some, ended the [[French Revolution]].

After the coup, Napoleon and his allies legitimized his position by crafting the "short and obscure Constitution of the Year VIII" (as [[Malcolm Crook]] has called it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
|last= Crook 
|first= Malcolm 
|url= http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~mstaum/hist329/NapForumCrook.html
|title= The Myth Of The 18 Brumaire 
|publisher= H-France Napoleon Forum 
|year= 1999
|accessdate= 2007-12-12}}
&lt;/ref&gt;). 
The constitution tailor-made the position of First Consul to give Napoleon most of the powers of a [[dictator]]. It was the first constitution since the 1789 Revolution without a Declaration of Rights.

The document vested executive power in three [[Consul]]s, but all actual power was held by the First Consul, Bonaparte. This differed from  [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre's]] [[National Convention| republic]] of {{circa}}1792 to 1795 (which was more [[political radicalism|radical]]), and from the [[oligarchic]] [[liberalism|liberal]] republic of the [[French Directory|Directory]] (1795-1799), but resembled the [[autocratic]] [[Principate|Roman Republic]] of [[Caesar Augustus]], a [[Conservatism| conservative]] [[Republicanism| republic-in-name]], which reminded the French of stability, order, and peace.{{cn|date=May 2015}} To emphasize this, the authors of the constitutional document used [[Ancient Rome|classical Roman]] terms, such as "[[Consul]]", [[Senate (France) | "Senator"]] and "[[Tribune]]".

The Constitution of Year VIII established a legislature of three houses, which was composed of a [[Sénat conservateur|Conservative Senate]] of 80 men over the age of 40, a [[Tribunat]]e of 100 men and a Legislative Body ([[Corps législatif]]) of 300 men.

The Constitution also used the term "[[notables]]". The word "notables" had been in common usage under the monarchy; every Frenchman understood it, and it was comforting.{{cn|date=May 2015}} It referred to prominent, "distinguished" men — landholders, merchants, scholars, professionals, clergymen and officials. The people in each district chose a slate of "notables"  by popular vote. The First Consul, the Tribunate, and the ''Corps Législatif'' each nominated one Senatorial candidate to the rest of the Senate, which chose one candidate from among the three. Once all of its members were picked, it would then appoint the Tribunate, the ''Corps Législatif'', the judges of [[cassation]], and the commissioners of accounts from the slate of notables.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

Napoleon held [[French constitutional referendum, 1800|a plebiscite on the Constitution]] on 7 February 1800. The vote was not binding, but it allowed Napoleon to maintain a veneer of democracy. [[Lucien Bonaparte]] announced results of 3,011,007 in favor and 1,562 against the new dispensation. The true result was probably around 1.55 million for it, with several thousand against it.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

This Constitution was amended, firstly, by the [[Constitution of the Year X]], which made Napoleon First Consul for Life. A more extensive alteration, the [[Constitution of the Year XII]], established the [[House of Bonaparte|Bonaparte]] dynasty with Napoleon as a hereditary Emperor. The first, brief [[Bourbon Restoration]] of 1814 abolished the Napoleonic constitutional system, but the Emperor revived it and at once virtually replaced it with the so-called [[Charter of 1815|"Additional Act"]] of April 1815, promulgated on [[Hundred Days | his return to power]]. The return of [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] in July 1815 (following the [[Hundred Days]]) saw the definitive abolition of Napoleon's constitutional arrangements. The Napoleonic constitutions were completely replaced by the Bourbon [[Charter of 1814]].

A '''deferred sentence''' is a sentence that is suspended until after a defendant has completed a period of [[probation]]. If the defendant fulfills the stipulations surrounding probation, a judge may then throw out the sentence and guilty plea, clearing the incident from their record. If the defendant violates probation, he or she must serve the full sentence immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deferred Sentence|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/d/deferred-sentence|website=USLegal|publisher=US Legal, Inc.|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, a defendant must plead guilty to at least one of the crimes he or she is accused of in order to receive a deferred sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Sentencing in Criminal Cases - Fines, Probation and Jail|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal/sentences.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=22 July 2017|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promise of a deferred sentence is often traded in exchange for a guilty plea in [[plea bargain]]s.

Deferred sentences are often given to first time offenders, or to those who have committed relatively minor crimes, although ultimately, the choice to defer a sentence is left to a judge's discretion.

===New York===
{{main|Adjournment in contemplation of dismissal}}
In the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], a similar process is known as [[adjournment in contemplation of dismissal]] (ACOD).  What typically happens in such a case is that the potential sentence is deferred for six months, and if the defendant stays out of trouble, the charge is dropped entirely with no public record of the offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal Information Sheet|url=http://nassau18b.org/forms/adjournment_in_contemplation_of_dismissal.pdf|website=Nassau County New York  Assigned Counsel Defender Plan|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A deferred sentence is not exactly the same as an ACOD. One of the primary differences is that receiving an ACOD doesn't require an admission of guilt or plea of guilty unlike a deferred sentence which requires such. Upon completion of the ACOD, the charges are automatically sealed, fingerprints &amp; mugshots are destroyed, and the arrest is annulled. There is no conviction and all rights you had prior to arrest are restored. In order to enter the deferred sentence program, a plea of guilt must be made. Even though successful completion of a deferred sentence results in a dismissal of charges and guilty plea withdrawal, most states still consider it to be a conviction since a plea of guilt was entered and you were considered "convicted" for the duration of the program. Furthermore, completion of a deferred sentence program usually requires a request to the court to have the underlying charges and arrest sealed.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

The '''Election Commission of Sri Lanka''' is the constitutional authority responsible for administering and overseeing all [[Elections in Sri Lanka|elections]] in [[Sri Lanka]], including the [[President of Sri Lanka|Presidential]], [[Parliament of Sri Lanka|Parliamentary]], [[Provinces of Sri Lanka|Provincial]] and [[Local government in Sri Lanka|Local Authority]] elections. Sri Lanka has had [[Universal suffrage|universal adult suffrage]] since 1931, becoming the first [[Crown colony]] to enfranchise all adult citizens, 3 years after the [[United Kingdom]] itself; the country is the oldest democracy in [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rajakarunanayake|first1=Lucien|title=Seven decades of Asia’s oldest democracy|url=http://dailynews.lk/2017/10/04/features/130214/seven-decades-asia%E2%80%99s-oldest-democracy|accessdate=4 February 2018|agency=Daily News|publisher=dailynews.lk|date=4 Oct 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="limelight"&gt;{{cite news|title=Elections Department in the limelight|url=http://www.ft.lk/article/478461/Elections-Department-in-the-limelight|accessdate=4 February 2018|agency=Daily Financial Times|publisher=ft.lk|date=3 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recommendations of the [[Soulbury Commission]] of 1944 led to the country's 1948 'Soulbury Constitution', granting it independence with [[Dominion]] status within the [[British Empire]] through the Ceylon Independence Act of 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceylon Independence Act 1947|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/11-12/7/enacted|website=legislation.gov.uk|publisher=The National Archives of the United Kingdom|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of the Commission began in 1944, with several pieces of key legislation being enacted in the interim as a result of its work- of these, the Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council of 1946 would lead to the 1948 constitution, while the Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections) Order in Council and the Local Authorities Ordinance enacted in the same year created two government departments that would eventually go on to form the Elections Commission.&lt;ref name="ourhistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.slelections.gov.lk/web/index.php/en/about-us/our-history|website=Official Website of the Election Commission of Sri Lanka|publisher=Election Commission of Sri Lanka|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aceproject"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Reprint of the Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections) Order in Council, 1946 (CHAPTER 381)|url=https://aceproject.org/regions-en/countries-and-territories/LK/case-studies/the-ceylon-parliamentary-elecions-order-in-council.pdf|website=aceproject.org|publisher=Government of Sri Lanka|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="performance"&gt;{{cite web|title=Performance Appraisal Report of the Department of Elections/Election Commission for the Year 2015|url=https://www.parliament.lk/uploads/documents/paperspresented/performance-report-department-of-elections-election-commission-2015.pdf|website=Parliament of Sri Lanka|publisher=Sri Lanka Department of Elections/Elections Commission of Sri Lanka|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 88A of the Ceylon (Parliamentary Elections) Order in Council of 1946 established the Department of Parliamentary elections headed by a Commissioner and assisted by Assistant and Deputy Commissioners, with the responsibility of registering electors and the conduct of Parliamentary Elections.&lt;ref name="limelight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aceproject"/&gt; At the same time, the Local Authorities Ordinance, No. 53 of 1946 established the Department of Local Authorities Elections under a separate Commissioner and staff to oversee and administer all non-Parliamentary elections on the island.&lt;ref name="limelight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="performance"/&gt; During its existence, the former oversaw two Parliamentary elections, in [[Ceylonese parliamentary election, 1947|1947]] and [[Ceylonese parliamentary election, 1952|1952]].&lt;ref name="limelight"/&gt; These two departments functioned independently of each other until 1 October 1955, when they were merged to form the Department of Elections; as was the case with its predecessors, the department functioned as an independent, non-ministerial institution answerable only to [[Parliament of Sri Lanka|Parliament]] and the [[Judiciary of Sri Lanka|Judiciary]].&lt;ref name="limelight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ourhistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="performance"/&gt;

'''The Employment Act 1980''' (c 42) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], passed under the first term of [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]'s premiership and mainly relating to [[trade union]]s.

==Overview==
It restricted the definition of lawful [[picketing (protest)|picketing]] 'strictly to those who were themselves party to the dispute and who were picketing at the premises of their own employer'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Downing Street Years|last=Thatcher|first=Margaret|publisher=Harper Collins|year=1993|isbn=0 00 638321 1|location=London|pages=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also introduced ballots on the existence of [[closed shops]], and at least 80% of the workers in a particular industry need to support them for their maintenance.

Since 2010, the [[European Union]] has launched three separate [[antitrust]] investigations into [[Google]] for violating the [[European Union competition law|EU's competition laws]] due to its dominant position in the market. These cases have resulted in formal charges against Google related to [[Google Shopping]], [[Google AdSense]] and the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]]. To date, Google has been found guilty of antitrust behavior in the cases related to Google Shopping and Android, and have been fined over {{€|6 billion}}.

== Google Shopping charges ==
On 10 November 2010, the European Commission opened a formal investigation into Google's search algorithm, following a number of complaints issued by smaller web companies that Google was downgrading their placement in results returned in Google's search results, and that Google was preferentially favoring their own products over competitors. The EC's investigation also considered if there were issues with Google's terms of use for [[Google AdSense]] that prevented those using AdSense to not use advertising from Google's competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/technology/01google.html | title = Europe Opens Antitrust Inquiry Into Google | first1 = James | last1 = Kanter | first2 = Eric | last2 = Pfanner | date = 30 November 2010 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 April 2015, five years into the investigation, the EC issued its first Statement of Objections towards Google related towards its preferential treatment of its [[Google Shopping]] product (including Google Product Search) in search results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-32315649 | title = EU accuses Google Shopping of search 'abuse' | date =15 April 2015 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work = [[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific complaints issued by the EC included:&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-4781_en.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Google's search results predominate display Google Shopping results regardless of the merits of how well the Google Shopping results met the results of the search query.
* Google does not apply its system of penalties, a predefined set of parameters to lower the placement of shopping results, to its own Google Shopping results as it did to other competitors.
* Google had already attempted a shopping product, Froogle, but which it did not give any preferential treatment, and as a result, performed poorly. In contrast, Google Shopping was given favorable placement in Google's search result, allowing the service to achieve higher rates of growth.
* Google's favoring of Google Shopping thus had a negative impact on consumers and innovation.

=== Decision and impact ===
On 7 June 2017, Google was found guilty and was charged {{€|2.4 billion}} (about {{USD|2.7 billion}}), the largest such antitrust fine issued by the EC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-buys-android/|title=Google buys Android|last=Olsen|first=Stefanie|date=8 October 2007|work=CNET|access-date=10 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;Google has denied the European Union's accusations against them and made a statement claiming “its services had helped the region's digital economy grow”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/technology/eu-google-fine.html|title=Google Fined Record $2.7 Billion in E.U. Antitrust Ruling|last=Scott|first=Mark|date=27 June 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=10 November 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fine represented just over 2.5% of Google's 2016 revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/27/technology/business/google-eu-antitrust-fine/index.html|title=EU slaps Google with record $2.7 billion fine|first=Ivana|last=Kottasová|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who are in competition with Google are pushing for their company to be individually monitored, for fear of losing more business to the dominant search engine. This would include investigating and overviewing Google's most prized search page algorithm, [[PageRank]]. The EU's Competition Commission decided to monitor their decision and Google's compliance with it, due to its obligation to report to the EUCC on a regular basis (every four months). Although the issue seems like it is at a close, the European Commission believes it will continue for some time.

In order to comply, Google is effectively separating its comparison shopping service into its own company after the fine. The Google Shopping service still will be a part of Google, but will run completely separately with its own revenues and profits. This move will allow Google to avoid further fines, according to [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], as it complies with the European Union's order of allowing even treatment to businesses, no matter if they compete with Google or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2017/09/26/google-create-shopping-unit-appease-european-union-antitrust-regulators/706277001/|title=Google rolls out shopping ad changes to appease European Union antitrust regulators|last=Guynn|first=Jessica|date=26 September 2017|work=USA TODAY|access-date=10 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even though Google is complying in part, the company is still appealing the decision. Google responded in its appeal papers to the EU Antitrust Fine by stating that the EU chair misstated facts and didn’t show enough evidence to prove that their site hurt rivals. Google wants the fine either overturned or reduced. The appeal was based on six arguments, with two of them being that the court didn’t prove that Google favored its own shopping service by placing paid ads on top the search results. Two of them stated that the courts misstated facts and evidence, and the other two argued that a fine wasn’t warranted as a possible penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/alphabets-google-responds-to-eu-antitrust-fine-1509388512|title=Alphabet’s Google Responds to EU Antitrust Fine|last=Drozdiak|first=Natalia|date=30 October 2017|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=10 November 2017|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Google AdSense charges ==
While investigating the case related to Google Shopping, the EC found additional evidence related to potential antitrust issues related to [[Google AdSense]], and issued a Statement of Complaints on 14 July 2016. These complaints were centered on how Google licensed AdSense to their direct partners:&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2532_en.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Google required direct partners to exclusively to Google's AdSense and could not engage with Google's competitors;
* Google required that partners take a minimum number of Google ads and predominately place them above any other advertising, nor could place ads from other services above or alongside Google's ads;
* Google required partners get confirmation from Google before making any changes for how they displayed Google's competitors' ads.

This case, as of October 2018, still remains under investigation by the EC.

== Android and mobile apps charges ==
=== Prior complaints ===
The EC's actions to investigate Google's approach to the Android operating system was predicated on two complaints it had received. The first complain came from [[FairSearch]]. FairSearch was established in 2010 as a coalition of travel-related web companies including [[Expedia]] and [[TripAdvisor]] to try to fight against Google's proposed acquisition of [[ITA Software|ITA]], which had developed airfare search software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wasserman|first1=Elizabeth|title=DOJ threatens to nix Google merger|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/50147.html|accessdate=30 December 2014|date=24 February 2011 | work = [[Politico]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group shifted towards becoming more of a Google watchdog group, looking at all instances of Google's activities which they considered were potentially anti-competition. Companies like [[Microsoft]], [[Nokia]], and [[Oracle]] joined the group to support this broader effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/12/4216026/who-is-fairsearch | title=  What is FairSearch and why does it hate Google so much? | first =Vlad | last = Savov | date = 12 April 2013 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to their attention to the Android system, FairSearch issued complaints to the EC over how Google's search engines would preferentially weight results from Google's own services or its partners over others, as part of antitrust investigations conducted by the EU since 2010.&lt;ref name="fairsearch complaint"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/8/4203684/microsoft-others-file-eu-antitrust-complaint-over-android-bundling | title = Microsoft and others file EU antitrust complaint over Android app bundling | first =  Jeff | last = Blagdon | date = 8 April 2013 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, the European branch of FairSearch filed a formal complaint to the EU, who were still investigating Google from previous complaints, citing that Google's practices with Android violated various [[European Union competition law|EU's antitrust laws]]. The complaint identified that Google required any original equipment manufacturer (OEM) wanting to install Google's suite of Android apps, including access to the [[Google Play Store]], had to license the entire suite and feature them predominately on the mobile device.&lt;ref name="fairsearch complaint"/&gt; 

A second anti-trust complaint against Google was filed by [[Aptoide]] in June 2014, an alternative marketplace for Android apps. Aptoide asserted that Google's approach to Google made it difficult for alternatives to the Google Play store to be installed, and that some of the components that were once part of Google's Android Open Source Project were moved into the Google Mobile Services suite, including Gmail, Google Maps, and the Play Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/google-abusing-its-android-power-says-third-party-app-store-ceo/ | title = Google is abusing its Play power, says third-party Android app store CEO | first = Luke | last =Westaway | date = 17 June 2014 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work = [[CNet]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== EU's investigation ===
On 15 April 2015, the European Commission started an official investigation against Google following on the complaints filed by FairSearch and Apotoide and its own internal evaluation of these complaints over about a year. The EC stated that the company may have taken unlawful actions to maintain Google's [[Dominance (economics)|dominant position]] in the mobile market by how it licensed its suite of Android applications. The new investigation was announced alongside the EC's findings in its antitrust investigation into Google's search engine practices, but otherwise treated as a separate action against Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/business/international/european-union-google-antitrust-case.html | title = Europe Challenges Google, Seeing Violations of Its Antitrust Law | first1 = James | last1 = Kanter | first2 = Mark | last2 = Scott | date = 16 April 2015 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work =[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission identified three points of concern in the first Statement of Objections:&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-15-4782_en.htm Antitrust: Commission opens formal investigation against Google in relation to Android mobile operating system], ''europa.eu'' (15 April 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

# Whether Google actions impede development of the market of mobile devices and access of competitors thereto by demanding or encouraging smart phone manufacturers to [[Pre-installed software|pre-install]] Google apps and services on their devices.
# Whether Google suppressed attempts of smart phone and tablet PC manufacturers willing to install Google apps on their devices to run on modified and potentially competitive versions of Android.
# Whether Google unlawfully impeded the market development by way of tacking the installation of certain Google apps with the use of other apps of this company or its software interface.

Google countered to this investigation that their practices with Android were no different with how [[Apple, Inc.]] or [[Microsoft]] bundles their own proprietary apps on their respective [[iOS]] and [[Windows Phone]], and that OEMs were still able to distribute Android-based phones without the Google suite of apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.fastcompany.com/3045132/read-googles-defensive-response-to-european-antitrust-charges | title = Read Google’s Defensive Response To European Antitrust Charges | first= David | last = Lumb | date = 16 April 2015 | accessdate = 18 October 2018 | work = [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the investigation, Google formed [[Alphabet Inc.]], a [[holding company]] for Google's various subsidiaries, with Google becoming one of Alphabet's subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-creates-new-company-alphabet-1439240645 |title=Google Creates Parent Company Called Alphabet in Restructuring |last=Chen |first=Angela |date=10 August 2015 |publisher=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A year after, on 20 April 2016, the European Commission announced the issue of the second Statement of Objections, now addressing both Google and Alphabet within its charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/technology/google-europe-antitrust.html | title=  E.U. Charges Dispute Google’s Claims That Android Is Open to All | first = Mark | last =Scott | date = 20 April 2016 | accessdate=  18 October 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new set of complaints, amending those of the first Statement of Objections, asserted Google violated EU's antitrust laws by:&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-1492_en.htm Antitrust: Commission sends Statement of Objections to Google on Android operating system and applications], ''europa.eu'' (20 April 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;
* by requiring mobile manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and Google Chrome browser and requiring them to set Google Search as default search service on their devices, as a condition to license certain Google proprietary apps;
* by preventing manufacturers from selling smart mobile devices running on competing operating systems based on the Android [[Open-source software|open source code]];
* by giving financial incentives to manufacturers and mobile network operators on condition that they exclusively pre-install Google Search on their devices.

The potential fines for the case, if Google were to be found violating antitrust laws, has a maximum amount of 10% of the company's annual revenue, about {{USD|7.4 billion}} at the time of the issuing of the Second Statement of Objection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/20/eu-commission-google-android-skew-market-competition-antitrust-vestager/ | title = AEU accuses Google of using Android to skew market against rivals | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 20 April 2016 | accessdate = 20 April 2016 | first = Jennifer | last= Rankin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decision and impact ===
On 19 July 2018, EU has fined Google {{€|4.3&amp;nbsp;billion}} (about {{USD|5 billion}}). Google responded it would appeal, according to company spokesperson Al Verney "Android has created more choice for everyone, not less". To date, this fine is the biggest ever imposed by European Union on a company for anti-competitive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google fined €4.3 billion by EU regulator |url=https://www.dw.com/en/google-fined-43-billion-by-eu-regulator/a-44719609 |website=[[Deutsche Welle]] |accessdate=28 July 2018 |language=en |date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who was part of the decision against Google, stated that only after the EU found against Google in the search anti-trust case in 2017 did Google attempt to settle on the issues of the Android anti-trust issues, which was far too late after the EU filed the initial charges against Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-22/the-story-behind-google-s-secret-offer-to-settle-android-probe | title = The Story Behind Google's Secret Offer to Settle EU’s Android Probe | first1 =  Aoife  | last1 = White | first2=  Stephanie | last2  = Bodoni | date = 22 July 2018 | accessdate = 22 July 2018 | work = [[Bloomberg LP]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[filmmaking]], a '''guarantee''', or informally a '''"pay-or-play" contract''', is a term in a contract of an actor, director, or other participant that guarantees remuneration if the participant is released from the contract without being responsible.

Studios are reluctant to agree to guarantees but accept them as part of the deal for signing major talent. They also have the advantage of enabling a studio to remove a participant under such a contract, with few legal complications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmslaw.com/articles/art60.htm Navigating The "Pay Or Play" Minefield], ''The Business Of Film'' October 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History of citizenship''' describes the changing relation between an individual and the state, commonly known as [[citizenship]]. Citizenship is generally identified not as an aspect of Eastern civilization but of [[history of Western civilization|Western civilization]].{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=4}} There is a general view that citizenship in ancient times was a simpler relation than modern forms of citizenship, although this view has been challenged.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt;

While there is disagreement about when the relation of citizenship began, many thinkers point to the early [[city-states]] of [[ancient Greece]], possibly as a reaction to the fear of [[slavery]], although others see it as primarily a modern phenomenon dating back only a few hundred years. In [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]], citizenship began to take on more of the character of a relationship based on law, with less political participation than in ancient Greece but a widening sphere of who was considered to be a citizen. In the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, citizenship was primarily identified with commercial and secular life in the growing cities, and it came to be seen as membership in emerging [[nationalism|nation-states]]. In modern democracies, citizenship has contrasting senses, including a ''liberal-individualist'' view emphasizing needs and entitlements and legal protections for essentially passive political beings, and a ''civic-republican'' view emphasizing political participation and seeing citizenship as an active relation with specific privileges and obligations.

While citizenship has varied considerably throughout history, there are some common elements of citizenship over time. Citizenship bonds extend beyond basic [[kinship]] ties to unite people of different genetic backgrounds, that is, citizenship is more than a [[clan]] or extended kinship network. It generally describes the relation between a person and an overall political entity such as a city-state or nation and signifies membership in that body. It is often based on, or a function of, some form of military service or expectation of future military service. It is generally characterized by some form of [[Participation (decision making)|political participation]], although the extent of such participation can vary considerably from minimal duties such as voting to active service in government. And citizenship, throughout history, has often been seen as an ideal state, closely allied with [[Political freedom|freedom]], an important status with legal aspects including [[rights]], and it has sometimes been seen as a ''bundle of rights'' or a ''right to have rights''.&lt;ref name=twsJun16&gt;{{cite book|author=Virginia Leary|editors=Alan C.

The rise of citizenship has been studied as an aspect of the development of [[law]].

[[File:Simon de Vos - The Israelites after Crossing the Red Sea - WGA25334.jpg|thumb|right|The Israelites preserved their identity as a people despite being enslaved by neighboring civilizations, and this sense of ethnic identity has been linked to the development of citizenship.]]
One view is that the beginning of citizenship dates back to the ancient Israelites.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; These people developed an understanding of themselves as a distinct and unique people—different from the Egyptians or Babylonians. They had a written history, common language and one-deity-only religion sometimes described as [[ethical monotheism]].&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; While most peoples developed a loose identity tied to a specific geographic location, the Jewish people kept their common identity despite being physically moved to different lands, such as when they were held captive as slaves in [[ancient Egypt]] or Babylon. The Jewish [[Covenant (biblical)|Covenant]] has been described as a binding agreement not just with a few people or tribal leaders, but between the whole nation of Israel, including men, women and children, with the Jewish deity [[Yahweh]].&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; Jews, similar to other tribal groups, did not see themselves as citizens per se but they formed a strong attachment to their own group, such that people of different ethnicities were considered as part of an "outgroup".&lt;ref name=tws2Y15xiii&gt;{{Cite book

====Polis citizenship====
{{Main|Polis}} 
There is more widespread agreement that the first real instances of citizenship began in [[ancient Greece]]. And while there were precursors of the relation in societies before then, it emerged in readily discernible form in the Greek city-states which began to dot the shores of the [[Aegean Sea]], the [[Black Sea]], the [[Adriatic Sea]], and elsewhere around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] perhaps around the 8th century BCE. The modern day distinction sometimes termed ''consent versus descent'' distinction—that is, [[naturalization|citizenship by choice]] versus [[Jus soli|birthright citizenship]], has been traced back to ancient Greece.&lt;ref name=tws2Y16/&gt; And thinkers such as [[J.G.A. Pocock]] have suggested that the modern-day ideal of citizenship was first articulated by the ancient Athenians and Romans, although he suggested that the "transmission" of the sense of citizenship over two millennia was essentially a [[myth]] enshrouding western civilization.&lt;ref name=tws2Y21&gt;{{Cite book

To the ancients, citizenship was a bond between a person and the city-state. Before Greek times, a person was generally connected to a tribe or kin-group such as an [[extended family]], but citizenship added a layer to these ties—a non-kinship bond between the person and the state.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|p.152}} Historian [[Geoffrey Hosking]] in his 2005 ''Modern Scholar'' lecture course suggested that citizenship in [[ancient Greece]] arose from an appreciation for the importance of [[Political freedom|freedom]].&lt;ref name=twsfjiui&gt;{{Cite book

{{Quote|It can be argued that this growth of slavery was what made Greeks particularly conscious of the value of freedom. After all, any Greek farmer might fall into debt and therefore might become a slave, at almost any time ... When the Greeks fought together, they fought in order to avoid being enslaved by warfare, to avoid being defeated by those who might take them into slavery. And they also arranged their political institutions so as to remain free men.|Geoffrey Hosking, 2005&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt;}}

[[File:Mines 1.jpg|thumb|right|Slaves working in a mine. The sustenance provided by slaves meant that citizens had free time to participate in politics.]]
[[File:Arte greca, pietra tombale di donna con la sua assistente, 100 ac. circa.JPG|thumb|right|Geoffrey Hosking suggests that fear of being enslaved was a central motivating force for the development of the Greek sense of citizenship. Sculpture: a Greek woman being served by a slave-child.]]

The Greek sense of the polis, in which citizenship and the rule of law prevailed, was an important strategic advantage for the Greeks during their [[Greco-Persian Wars|wars with Persia]].&lt;ref name = Dise&gt;Robert L. Dise, Jr., The Great Courses, ''Ancient Empires before Alexander'', The Teaching Company, 2009, Part 3 of 3, see p. 33 in the guide book, Accessed Nov. 6, 2013, {{ISBN|1-59803-558-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The polis was grounded in nomos, the rule of law, which meant that no man—no matter who he might be—was master, and all men were subject to the same rules. Any leader who set himself above the law was reckoned to be a tyrannos—a tyrant. It was also grounded in the notion of citizenship—the idea that every man born from the blood of the community has a share in power and responsibility. This notion that ... the proper way for us to live is as citizens in communities under the rule of law ... is an idea originated by the Greeks and bequeathed by them as their greatest contribution to the rest of mankind and history. It meant that Greeks were willing to live, fight, and die for their poleis...|Robert L. Dise, Jr., 2009&lt;ref name = Dise/&gt;}}

Greeks could see the benefits of having slaves, since their labor permitted slaveowners to have substantial free time, enabling participation in public life.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; While Greeks were spread out in many separate city-states, they had many things in common in addition to shared ideas about citizenship: the Mediterranean trading world, [[kinship]] ties, the common Greek language, a shared hostility to the so-called non-Greek-speaking or barbarian peoples, belief in the prescience of the [[Pythia|oracle at Delphi]], and later on the early [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] which involved generally peaceful athletic competitions between city-states.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; City-states often feuded with each other; one view was that regular wars were necessary to perpetuate citizenship, since the seized goods and slaves helped make the city-state rich, and that a long peaceful period meant ruin for citizenship.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=48}}

An important aspect of [[polis]] citizenship was exclusivity. ''Polis'' meant both the political assembly as well as the entire society.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=32}} Inequality of status was widely accepted. Citizens had a higher status than non-citizens, such as women, slaves or [[barbarians]].&lt;ref name=tws2Y16/&gt;{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=33}} For example, women were believed to be irrational and incapable of political participation, although a few writers, most notably [[Plato]], disagreed. Methods used to determine whether someone could be a citizen or not could be based on wealth, identified by the amount of taxes one paid, or political participation, or heritage if both parents were citizens of the polis. The first form of citizenship was based on the way people lived in the [[ancient Greek]] times, in small-scale organic communities of the polis. Citizenship was not seen as a separate activity from the private life of the individual person, in the sense that there was not a distinction between [[public sphere|public]] and [[Private sphere|private]] life. The obligations of citizenship were deeply connected into one's everyday life in the polis.

[[File:Greek Phalanx.jpg|thumb|right|The Greek-style [[phalanx]] required close cohesion, since each soldier's shield protected the soldier to his left. Many thinkers link the phalanx to the development of citizenship.]]
The Greek sense of citizenship may have arisen from military necessity, since a key military formation demanded cohesion and commitment by each particular soldier. The [[phalanx]] formation had [[hoplite]] soldiers ranked shoulder-to-shoulder in a "compact mass" with each soldier's shield guarding the soldier to his left.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; If a single fighter failed to keep his position, then the entire formation could fall apart. Individual soldiers were generally protected provided that the entire mass stayed together.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; This technique called for large numbers of soldiers, sometimes involving most of the adult male population of a city-state, who supplied weapons at their own expense.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; The idea of citizenship, then, was that if each man had a say in whether the entire city-state should fight an adversary, and if each man was bound to the will of the group, then battlefield loyalty was much more likely.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; Political participation was thus linked with military effectiveness. In addition, the Greek city-states were the first instances in which [[judicial]] functions were separated from [[legislature|legislative]] functions in the law courts.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; Selected citizens served as jurors, and they were often paid a modest sum for their service.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; Greeks often despised tyrannical governments. In a tyrannical arrangement, there was no possibility of citizenship since political life was totally engineered to benefit the ruler.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;

====Spartan citizenship====
[[File:Young Spartans National Gallery NG3860.jpg|thumb|right|The culture of [[ancient Sparta]] valued physical exercise, often in the nude, with training for young men described as "ferociously fierce".]]
Several thinkers suggest that ancient [[Ancient Sparta|Sparta]], not [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], was the originator of the concept of citizenship.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Spartan citizenship was based on the principle of [[Equality of outcome|equality]] among a ruling military elite called [[Spartiate]]s.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; They were "full Spartan citizens"—men who graduated from a rigorous regimen of military training and at age 30 received a land allotment called a kleros, although they had to keep paying dues to pay for food and drink as was required to maintain citizenship.&lt;ref name=Worthington2&gt;''The Long Shadow of the Ancient Greek World'', professor Ian Worthington, U. Missouri-Columbia, Part 2 of 4, The Teaching Company, {{ISBN|1-59803-544-4}}, 2009, see page 18 of the guidebook&lt;/ref&gt; In the Spartan approach to phalanx warfare, virtues such as [[courage]] and [[loyalty]] were particularly emphasized relative to other Greek city-states.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|p.10}} Each Spartan citizen owned at least a minimum portion of the public land which was sufficient to provide food for a family, although the size of these plots varied.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; The Spartan citizens relied on the labor of captured slaves called [[helots]] to do the everyday drudgework of farming and maintenance, while the Spartan men underwent a rigorous military regimen, and in a sense it was the labor of the helots which permitted Spartans to engage in extensive military training and citizenship.&lt;ref name=Worthington2/&gt; Citizenship was viewed as incompatible with manual labor.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Citizens ate meals together in a "communal mess".&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt;&lt;ref name=Worthington2/&gt; They were "frugally fed, ferociously disciplined, and kept in constant training through martial games and communal exercises," according to Hosking.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; As young men, they served in the military. It was seen as virtuous to participate in government when men grew older.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Participation was required; failure to appear could entail a loss of citizenship.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|p.11}} But the [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] viewed the Spartan model of citizenship as "artificial and strained", according to one account.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|12}} While Spartans were expected to learn [[music]] and [[poetry]], serious study was discouraged.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; Historian Ian Worthington described a "Spartan mirage" in the sense that the mystique about military invincibility tended to obscure weaknesses within the Spartan system, particularly their dependence on helots.&lt;ref name=Worthington2/&gt; In contrast with Athenian women, Spartan women could own property, and owned at one point up to 40% of the land according to Aristotle, and they had greater independence and rights, although their main task was not to rule the homes or participate in governance but rather to produce strong and healthy babies.&lt;ref name=Worthington3&gt;''The Long Shadow of the Ancient Greek World'', professor Ian Worthington, U. Missouri-Columbia, Part 2 of 4, The Teaching Company, {{ISBN|1-59803-544-4}}, 2009, see p. 29 of the guidebook&lt;/ref&gt;

====Athenian citizenship====
In a book entitled ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'', written in 350 BCE, the ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] suggested that ancient Greeks thought that being a citizen was a natural state, according to [[J. G. A. Pocock]].&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; It was an [[elitism|elitist]] notion, according to Peter Riesenberg, in which small scale communities had generally similar ideas of how people should behave in society and what constituted appropriate conduct.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Geoffrey Hosking described a possible Athenian logic leading to [[participatory democracy]]:

{{Quote|If you've got a lot of soldiers of rather modest means, and you want them to enthusiastically participate in war, then you've got to have a political and economic system which doesn't allow too many of them to fall into debt, because debt ultimately means slavery, and slaves cannot fight in the army. And it needs a political system which gives them a say on matters that concern their lives.|Geoffrey Hosking, 2005&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt;}}

As a consequence, the original Athenian aristocratic constitution gradually became more inappropriate, and gave way to a more inclusive arrangement.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; In the early 6th century BCE, the reformer [[Solon]] replaced the [[Draconian constitution]] with the [[Solonian Constitution]]. Solon canceled all existing land debts, and enabled free Athenian males to participate in the assembly or [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ecclesia]].&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; In addition, he encouraged foreign craftsmen, particularly skilled in pottery, to move to Athens and offered citizenship by naturalization as an incentive.&lt;ref name=Worthington1/&gt;

Solon expected that aristocratic Athenians would continue running affairs but nevertheless citizens had a "political voice in the Assembly."&lt;ref name=Worthington1&gt;''The Long Shadow of the Ancient Greek World'', professor Ian Worthington, U.

Subsequent reformers moved Athens even more towards [[direct democracy]]. The Greek reformer [[Cleisthenes]] in 508 BCE re-engineered Athenian society from organizations based on family-style groupings, or [[phratry|phratries]], to larger mixed structures which combined people from different types of geographic areas—coastal areas and cities, hinterlands, and plains—into the same group.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.V. Fine, The Ancient Greeks: A Critical History&lt;/ref&gt; Cleisthenes abolished the tribes by "redistributing their identity so radically" so they ceased to exist.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; The result was that farmers, sailors and sheepherders came together in the same political unit, in effect lessening kinship ties as a basis for citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, John V.A. The Ancient Greeks: A critical history (Harvard University Press, 1983). {{ISBN|0-674-03314-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, Athenian citizenship extended beyond basic bonds such as ties of family, descent, religion, race, or tribal membership, and reached towards the idea of a civic multiethnic state built on democratic principles.

{{Quote|Cleisthenes took democracy to the masses in a way that Solon didn't. ... Cleisthenes gave these same people the opportunity to participate in a political system in which all citizens—noble and non-noble—were in theory equal, and regardless of where they lived in Attica, could take part in some form of state administration.|Ian Worthington, 2009&lt;ref name=Worthington1/&gt;}}

Athenian citizenship was based on [[Duty|obligations]] of citizens towards the community rather than [[rights]] given to its members. This was not a problem because people had a strong affinity with the polis; their personal destiny and the destiny of the entire community were strongly linked. Also, citizens of the polis saw obligations to the community as an opportunity to be virtuous. It was a source of honour and respect.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; According to one view, the citizenry was "its own master".&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; The people were [[sovereignty|sovereign]]; there was no sovereignty outside of the people themselves.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; In Athens, citizens were both ruler and ruled. Further, important political and judicial offices were rotated to widen participation and prevent corruption, and all citizens had the right to speak and vote in the political assembly. Pocock explained:

{{Quote|... what makes the citizen the highest order of being is his capacity to rule, and it follows that rule over one's equal is possible only where one's equal rules over one. Therefore the citizen rules and is ruled; citizens join each other in making decisions where each decider respects the authority of the others, and all join in obeying the decisions (now known as "laws") they have made.|J.G.A. Pocock{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=33}}}}

The Athenian conception was that "laws that should govern everybody," in the sense of [[equality under the law]] or the Greek term ''[[isonomia]]''.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; Citizens had certain [[rights]] and [[duties]]: the rights included the chance to speak and vote in the common assembly,&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; to stand for public office, to serve as jurors, to be protected by the law, to own land, and to participate in public worship; duties included an obligation to obey the law, and to serve in the armed forces which could be "costly" in terms of buying or making expensive war equipment or in risking one's own life, according to Hosking.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt;

{{Quote|This balance of participation, obligations and rights constituted the essence of citizenship, together with the feeling that there was a common interest which imposed its obligations on everyone.|Geoffrey Hosking, 2005&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt;}}

Hosking noticed that citizenship was "relatively narrowly distributed" and excluded all women, all minors, all slaves, all immigrants, and most colonials, that is, citizens who left their city to start another usually lost their rights from their city-state of origin.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; Many historians felt this exclusiveness was a weakness in Athenian society, according to Hosking, but he noted that there were perhaps 50,000 Athenian citizens overall, and that at most, a tenth of these ever took part in an actual assembly at any one time.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; Hosking argued that if citizenship had been spread more widely, it would have hurt solidarity.&lt;ref name=twsfjiui/&gt; Pocock expresses a similar sentiment and noted that citizenship requires a certain distance from the day-to-day drudgery of daily living.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=34}} Greek males solved this problem to some extent with the subjugation of women as well as the institution of slavery which freed their schedules so they could participate in the assembly. Pocock asked: for citizenship to happen, was it necessary to prevent free people from becoming "too much involved in the world of things"?{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=34}} Or, could citizenship be extended to working class persons, and if so, what does this mean for the nature of citizenship itself?{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=34}}

====Plato on citizenship====
The philosopher [[Plato]] envisioned a warrior class similar to the Spartan conception in that these persons did not engage in farming, business, or handicrafts, but their main duty was to prepare for war: to train, to exercise, to train, to exercise, constantly.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|pp.14–15}}&lt;ref&gt;Note: see Plato, 1941, VIII. 546&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Spartan practice, Plato's idealized community was one of citizens who kept common meals to build common bonds.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|14–15}} Citizenship status, in Plato's ideal view, was inherited. There were four separate classes.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|pp.14–15}} There were penalties for failing to vote.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|p.15}} A key part of citizenship was obeying the law and being "deferent to the social and political system" and having internal self-control.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|15}}

====Aristotle on citizenship====
Writing a generation after Plato, and in contrast with his teacher, [[Aristotle]] did not like Sparta's commune-oriented approach.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|p.16}} He felt Sparta's land allocation system as well as the communal meals led to a world in which rich and poor were polarized.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|16}} He recognized differences in citizenship patterns based on age: the young were "underdeveloped" citizens, while the elderly were "superannuated" citizens.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|p.17}} And he noted that it was hard to classify the citizenship status of some persons, such as resident aliens who still had access to courts, or citizens who had lost their citizenship franchise.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|17}}

Still, Aristotle's conception of citizenship was that it was a legally guaranteed role in creating and running government.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|p.151}} It reflected the [[division of labor]] which he believed was a good thing; citizenship, in his view, was a commanding role in society with citizens ruling over non-citizens. At the same time, there could not be a permanent barrier between the rulers and the ruled, according to Aristotle's conception, and if there was such a barrier, citizenship could not exist.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|151}} Aristotle's sense of citizenship depended on a "rigorous separation of public from private, of [[polis]] from [[oikos]], of persons and actions from [[materialism|things]]" which allowed people to interact politically with equals.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=33}} To be truly human, one had to be an active citizen to the community:

{{Quote|To take no part in the running of the community's affairs is to be either a beast or a god!|Aristotle&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|p.17}}&lt;ref name="Aristotle, 1948, 1253a"&gt;Aristotle, 1948, 1253a&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Aristotle's view, "man is a political animal".&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|p.17}} Isolated men were not truly free, in his view.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|17}}&lt;ref name="Aristotle, 1948, 1253a"/&gt; A beast was animal-like without self-control over passions and unable to coordinate with other beasts, and therefore could not be a citizen.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|17}}&lt;ref name="Aristotle, 1948, 1253a"/&gt; And a [[Greek god|god]] was so powerful and immortal that he or she did not need help from others.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|p.17}}&lt;ref name="Aristotle, 1948, 1253a"/&gt; In Aristotle's conception, citizenship was possible generally in a small city-state since it required direct participation in public affairs&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|p.18}} with people knowing "one another's characters".&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|p.18}}&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, 1948, 1326b&lt;/ref&gt; What mattered, according to Pocock's interpretation of Aristotle, was that citizens had the freedom to take part in political discussions if they chose to do so.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=34}} And citizenship was not merely a means to being free, but was freedom itself, a valued escape from the home-world of the [[oikos]] to the political world of the [[polis]].{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=34}}&lt;ref name=tws2Y22/&gt;{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=9}} It meant active sharing in civic life, meaning that all men rule, and are ruled, alternatively.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|p.18}}&lt;ref name=tws2Y16/&gt;&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|151}}&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, 1948, 1283b&lt;/ref&gt; And citizens were those who shared in deliberative and judicial office, and in that sense, attained the status of citizenship.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|18}}&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, 1948, 1275b&lt;/ref&gt; What citizens do should benefit not just a segment of society, but be in the interest of everybody.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|18}} Unlike Plato, Aristotle believed that women were incapable of citizenship since it did not suit their natures.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{rp|128}} In Aristotle's conception, humans are destined "by nature" to live in a political association and take short turns at ruling, inclusively, participating in making legislative, judicial and executive decisions. But Aristotle's sense of "inclusiveness" was limited to adult Greek males born in the polity: women, children, slaves, and foreigners (that is, resident aliens), were generally excluded from political participation.

===Roman conceptions===

====Differences from Greece====
[[File:Comitia Centuriata.jpg|thumb|right|During the [[Roman Republic]], soldiers of the army met in a democratic assembly called the [[Centuriate Assembly]] which gathered for legislative, electoral, and military purposes. But the participation of most Roman citizens in politics waned as Rome grew.]]
Roman citizenship was similar to the Greek model but differed in substantive ways. Geoffrey Hosking argued that Greek ideas of citizenship in the city-state, such as the principles of [[equality under the law]], civic participation in government, and notions that "no one citizen should have too much power for too long", were carried forth into the Roman world.&lt;ref name=twsffujfk&gt;{{Cite book

One view was that the Greek sense of citizenship was an "emancipation from the world of things" in which citizens essentially acted upon other citizens; material things were left back in the private domestic world of the [[oikos]].{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=35}} But the Roman sensibility took into account to a greater extent that citizens could act upon material things as well as other citizens, in the sense of buying or selling property, possessions, titles, goods. Accordingly, citizens often encountered other citizens on the basis of commerce which often required regulation. It introduced a new level of complexity regarding the concept of citizenship. Pocock explained:

{{Quote|The person was defined and represented through his actions upon things; in the course of time, the term property came to mean, first, the defining characteristic of a human or other being; second, the relation which a person had with a thing; and third, the thing defined as the possession of some person.|[[J. G. A. Pocock]], 1988{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=36}}}}

====Class concerns====
A further departure from the Greek model was that the Roman government pitted the upper-class [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] interests against the lower-order working groups known as the [[plebs|plebeian]] class in a dynamic arrangement,&lt;ref name=twsffujfk/&gt; sometimes described as a "tense tug-of-war" between the dignity of the great man and the liberty of the small man.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; Through worker discontent, the plebs threatened to set up a rival city to Rome, and through negotiation around 494 BCE, won the right to have their interests represented in government by officers known as [[tribune]]s.&lt;ref name=twsffujfk/&gt; The [[Roman Republic]], according to Hosking, tried to find a balance between the upper and lower classes.&lt;ref name=twsffujfk/&gt; And writers such as Burchell have argued that citizenship meant different things depending on what [[social class]] one belonged to: for upper-class men, citizenship was an active chance to influence public life; for lower-class men, it was about a respect for "private rights" or [[ius privatum]].&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, David (1995) 'The Attributes of Citizens: Virtue, Manners and the Activity of Citizenship', ''Economy and Society'', 24 (4):540–558.&lt;/ref&gt;

====A legal relation====
[[File:Almeida Júnior - Apóstolo São Paulo, 1869.jpg|thumb|right|[[Saint Paul]] declared that he was a Roman citizen and therefore deserved to be treated with fairness before the law.]]
Pocock explained that a citizen came to be understood as a person "free to act by law, free to ask and expect the law's protection, a citizen of such and such a legal community, of such and such a legal standing in that community."{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=37}} An example was [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]] demanding fair treatment after his arrest by claiming to be a Roman citizen.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=37}}&lt;ref&gt;Note: Paul's claim of being a Roman citizen did not ultimately prevent his execution.&lt;/ref&gt; Many thinkers including Pocock suggested that the Roman conception of citizenship had a greater emphasis than the Greek one of it being a legal relationship with the state,&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; described as the "legal and political shield of a free person".&lt;ref name=tws2Y15/&gt; And citizenship was believed to have had a "cosmopolitan character".&lt;ref name=tws2Y22/&gt;&lt;ref name=tws2Y16/&gt;{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=10}} Citizenship meant having rights to have possessions, immunities, expectations, which were "available in many kinds and degrees, available or unavailable to many kinds of person for many kinds of reason."{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=37}} Citizens could "sue and be sued in certain courts".{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=37}} And the law, itself, was a kind of bond uniting people, in the sense of it being the results of past decisions by the assembly, such that citizenship came to mean "membership in a community of shared or common law".{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=38}} According to Pocock, the Roman emphasis on law changed the nature of citizenship: it was more impersonal, universal, multiform, having different degrees and applications.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=38}} It included many different types of citizenship: sometimes municipal citizenship, sometimes empire-wide citizenship.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=38}}

[[File:Leipzig Reichsgericht außen Detail 004.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Twelve Tables]] inscribed law in stone, and protected citizenship since the law was plainly visible for everybody to see.]]
Law continued to advance as a subject under the Romans. The Romans developed law into a kind of science known as [[jurisprudence]]. Law helped protect citizens:

{{Quote|The college of priests agreed to have basic laws inscribed upon twelve stone tablets displayed in the forum for everyone to see ... Inscribing these things on stone tablets was very important because it meant, first of all, that law was stable and permanent; the same for everyone, and it could not be altered at the whim of powerful people. And secondly, it was publicly known; it was not secret; it could be consulted by anybody at any time.|Geoffrey Hosking, 2005&lt;ref name=twsffujfk/&gt;}}

Specialists in law found ways to adapt the fixed laws, and to have the [[common law]] or [[jus gentium]], work in harmony with [[natural law]] or [[ius naturale]], which are rules common to all things.&lt;ref name=twsffujfk/&gt; [[Property]] was protected by law, and served as a protection of individuals against the power of the state. In addition, unlike the Greek model where laws were mostly made in the assembly, Roman law was often determined in other places than official government bodies. Rules could originate through court rulings, by looking to past court rulings, by sovereign decrees, and the effect was that the assembly's power became increasingly marginalized.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=40}}

====Expansion of citizenship====
In the [[Roman Empire]], polis citizenship expanded from small scale communities to the entire empire. In the early years of the [[Roman Republic]], citizenship was a prized relationship which was not widely extended. Romans realised that granting citizenship to people from all over the empire legitimized Roman rule over conquered areas. As the centuries went by, citizenship was no longer a status of political agency, but it had been reduced to a judicial safeguard and the expression of rule and law.&lt;ref&gt;For further information, see [[Civis romanus sum]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman conception of citizenship was relatively more complex and nuanced than the earlier Athenian conception, and it usually did not involve political participation.{{sfn|Pocock|1998|p=37}} There was a "multiplicity of roles" for citizens to play, and this sometimes led to "contradictory obligations".&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|p.165}} Roman citizenship was not a single black-and-white category of ''citizen'' versus ''non-citizen'', but rather there were more gradations and relationships possible. Women were respected to a greater extent with a secure status as what Hosking terms "subsidiary citizens".&lt;ref name=twsffujfk/&gt;

But the citizenship rules generally had the effect of building loyalty throughout the empire among highly diverse populations.&lt;ref name=tws2Y16/&gt; The Roman statesman [[Cicero]], while encouraging political participation, saw that too much civic activism could have consequences that were possibly dangerous and disruptive.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; David Burchell argued that in Cicero's time, there were too many citizens pushing to "enhance their dignitas", and the result of a "political stage" with too many actors all wanting to play a leading role, was discord.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burchell, David (1998) 'Civic Personae: MacIntyre, Cicero and Moral Personality', ''History of Political Thought'', 19 (1): 101–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of extreme [[Equality of outcome|inequality]] of landed wealth led to a decline in the citizen-soldier arrangement, and was one of many causes leading to the dissolution of the Republic and rule by [[dictator]]s.&lt;ref name=twsffujfk/&gt; The Roman Empire gradually expanded the inclusiveness of persons considered as "citizens", while the economic power of persons declined, and fewer men wanted to serve in the military.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; The granting of citizenship to wide swaths of non-Roman groups diluted its meaning, according to one account.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt;

====Decline of Rome====
When the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|Western Roman empire fell]] in 476 AD,&lt;ref&gt;Note: this date has been questioned by some historians—Arnaldo Momigliano, 1973, "La caduta senza rumore di un impero nel 476 d.C." ("The noiseless fall of an empire in 476 AD").&lt;/ref&gt; the western part run by Rome was sacked, while the eastern empire headquartered at [[Constantinople]] endured. Some thinkers suggest that as a result of historical circumstances, western Europe evolved with two competing sources of authority—religious and secular—and that the ensuing [[separation of church and state]] was a "major step" in bringing forth the modern sense of citizenship.&lt;ref name=tws2Y15/&gt; In the eastern half which survived, religious and secular authority were merged in the one emperor. The eastern Roman emperor [[Justinian]], who ruled the eastern empire from 527 to 565, thought that citizenship meant people living with honor, not causing harm, and to "give each their due" in relation with fellow citizens.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justinian. Institutiones: I.i&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early modern ideas of citizenship==

===Feudalism===
[[File:Hochosterwitz 01052004 04.jpg|thumb|right|During the [[Middle Ages]], the lord-vassal relation dominated; vassals provided service and loyalty, while lords provided protection.]]
In the [[feudal system]], there were relationships characterized as reciprocal, with bonds between lords and vassals going both ways: vassals promised loyalty and subsistence, while lords promised protection.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; The basis of feudal arrangement was control over land.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; The loyalty of a person was not to a law, or to a constitution, or to an abstract concept such as a nation, but to a person, namely, the next higher-level up, such as a knight, lord, or king.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=3}} One view is that feudalism's reciprocal obligation system gave rise to the idea of the individual and the citizen.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|p.161}} According to a related view, the [[Magna Carta]], while a sort of "feudal document", marked a transition away from feudalism since the document was not a personal unspoken bond between nobles and the king, but rather was more like a [[contract]]&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|161}} between two parties, written in formal language, describing how different parties were supposed to behave towards each other. The Magna Carta posited that the liberty, security and freedom of individuals were "inviolable".&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|161}} Gradually the personal ties linking vassals with lords were replaced with contractual and more impersonal relationships.{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=3}}

The early days of [[medieval commune]]s were marked by intensive citizenship, according to one view.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Sometimes there was terrific religious activism, spurred by fanatics and religious zealotry, and as a result of the discord and religious violence, Europeans learned to value the "dutiful passive citizen" as much preferred to the "self-directed religious zealot", according to another.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt;

===Renaissance Italy===
According to historian Andrew C. Fix, unlike the rest of Europe, 14th century Italy was urbanized to a much greater extent, with more people living in towns such as [[Milan, Italy|Milan]], [[Rome, Italy|Rome]], [[Genoa, Italy|Genoa]], [[Pisa, Italy|Pisa]], [[History of Florence|Florence]], [[History of the Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Naples, Italy|Naples]].&lt;ref name="twsTeachCompanyFix1"/&gt; Trade in spices with the Middle East, and new industries such as wool and clothing, led to greater prosperity, which in turn permitted greater education and study of the [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]], particularly among urbanized youth.&lt;ref name="twsTeachCompanyFix1"/&gt; A philosophy of ''Studia Huminitatis'', later called [[humanism]], emerged with an emphasis away from the church and towards secularism; thinkers reflected on the study of [[ancient Rome]] and [[ancient Greece]] including its ideas of citizenship and politics. Competition among the cities helped spur thinking.&lt;ref name="twsTeachCompanyFix1"/&gt;

Fix suggested that of the northern Italian cities, it was [[History of Florence|Florence]] which most closely resembled a [[Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;Note: the term 'commune' denoted a 'republic' back then&lt;/ref&gt; although most Italian cities were "complex oligarchies ruled by groups of rich citizens called ''patricians'', the commercial elite."&lt;ref name="twsTeachCompanyFix1"/&gt; While the city had thrown off control by the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the twelfth century, it came close to being conquered by Milan in 1450, but was spared when the capable leader of Milan died unexpectedly during a siege. Florence's city leaders wondered how to protect their city in the future, and figured that [[Civics|civic education]] was crucial so that citizens and leaders could cope with future unexpected crises.&lt;ref name="twsTeachCompanyFix1"/&gt; Politics, previously "shunned as unspiritual", came to be viewed as a "worthy and honorable vocation", and it was expected that most sectors of the public, from the richer commercial classes and patricians, to workers and the lower classes, should participate in public life.&lt;ref name="twsTeachCompanyFix1"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new sense of citizenship began to emerge based on an "often turbulent internal political life in the towns", according to Fix, with competition among guilds and "much political debate and confrontation".&lt;ref name="twsTeachCompanyFix1"/&gt;

===Early European towns===
[[File:View of Ancient Florence by Fabio Borbottoni 1820-1902 (7).jpg|thumb|right|Emerging cities such as [[Florence, Italy|Florence]] gave people new opportunities to be a citizen of their city, or participate in a guild, or serve on a town council.]]
[[File:Idrija town square.jpg|thumb|right|An emerging phenomenon dubbed the [[public sphere]] emerged in Europe, a space between government authority and private life, in which citizens could have rational-critical discussions in town squares like this one about government decisions, and form [[public opinion]] as a counterweight to authority.]]
During the [[Renaissance]] and growth of Europe, medieval political scholar Walter Ullmann suggested that the essence of the transition was from people being subjects of a monarch or lord to being citizens of a city and later to a nation.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|p.161}} A distinguishing characteristic of a city was having its own law, courts, and independent administration.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=44}} And being a citizen often meant being subject to the city's law in addition to helping to choose officials.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=44}} Cities were defensive entities, and its citizens were persons who were "economically competent to bear arms, to equip and train themselves."{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=44}} According to one theorist, the requirement that individual citizen-soldiers provide their own equipment for fighting helped to explain why Western cities evolved the concept of citizenship, while Eastern ones generally did not.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=44}} And city dwellers who had fought alongside nobles in battles were no longer content with having a subordinate social status, but demanded a greater role in the form of citizenship.{{sfn|Weber|1998|p=46}} In addition to city administration as a way of participating in political decision-making, membership in [[guild]]s was an indirect form of citizenship in that it helped their members succeed financially; guilds exerted considerable political influence in the growing towns.{{sfn|Weber|1998|pp=46-47}}

During European Middle Ages, citizenship was usually associated with cities.&lt;ref&gt;Note: see [[bourgeoisie|burgher]], [[Grand Burgher]] (German ''Großbürger'') and [[Bourgeoisie]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nobility]] in the [[aristocracy]] used to have [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s of a higher nature than [[commoner]]s. The rise of citizenship was linked to the rise of republicanism, according to one account, since if a republic belongs to its citizens, then kings have less power.{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=3}} In the emerging nation-states, the territory of the nation was its land, and citizenship was an idealized concept.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Increasingly, citizenship related not to a person such as a lord or count, but rather citizenship related a person to the state on the basis of more abstract terms such as rights and duties.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;

Citizenship was increasingly seen as a result of birth, that is, a birthright. But nations often welcomed foreigners with vital skills and capabilities, and came to accept these new people under a process of [[naturalization]]. Increasing frequency of cases of naturalization helped people see citizenship as a relationship which was freely chosen by people. Citizens were people who voluntarily chose allegiance to the state, who accepted the legal status of citizenship with its rights and responsibilities, who obeyed its laws, who were loyal to the state.&lt;ref name=tws2Y16/&gt;

The idea of a political party took form with groups debating rights to political representation during the [[Putney Debates]] of 1647. After the [[English Civil War]]s (1642–1651) and the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] was enacted in 1689, which codified certain rights and liberties.

The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects.... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth.

===The American Revolution===
British colonists across the Atlantic had grown up in a system in which local government was democratic, marked by participation by affluent men, but after the [[French and Indian War]], colonists came to resent an increase in taxes imposed by Britain to offset expenses. What was particularly irksome to colonists was their lack of representation in the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]], and the phrase [[no taxation without representation]] became a common grievance. The struggle between rebelling colonists and British troops was a time when citizenship "worked", according to one view.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; American and subsequent French declarations of rights were instrumental in linking the notion of fundamental rights to [[popular sovereignty]]&lt;ref name=tws2Y22/&gt;{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=10}} in the sense that governments drew their legitimacy and authority from the [[consent of the governed]]. The Framers designed the [[United States Constitution]] to accommodate a rapidly growing republic by opting for [[representative democracy]] as opposed to [[direct democracy]], but this arrangement challenged the idea of citizenship in the sense that citizens were, in effect, choosing other persons to represent them and take their place in government.{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=10}} The revolutionary spirit created a sense of "broadening inclusion".&lt;ref name=tws2Y22/&gt;{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=10}} The Constitution specified a three-part structure of government with a federal government and state governments, but it did not specify the relation of citizenship. The [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] protected the rights of individuals from intrusion by the federal government, although it had little impact on judgements by the courts for the first 130 years after ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bill Of Rights: A Brief History|url=https://www.aclu.org/bill-rights-brief-history|publisher=ACLU|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''citizen'' was not defined by the Constitution until the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] was added in 1868, which defined United States citizenship to include "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof." The American Revolution demonstrated that it was plausible for [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas about how a government should be organized to actually be put into practice.

===The French Revolution===
[[File:Nicolas-Antoine Taunay - Le bivouac des sans-coulottes.jpg|thumb|right|Painting recreating a scene from the [[French Revolution]]. It linked citizenship with popular sovereignty.]]
The [[French Revolution]] marked major changes and has been widely seen as a watershed event in modern politics. Up until then, the main ties between people under the [[Ancien Regime]] were hierarchical, such that each person owed loyalty to the next person further up the chain of command; for example, serfs were loyal to local vassals, who in turn were loyal to nobles, who in turn were loyal to the king, who in turn was presumed to be loyal to [[God]].&lt;ref name = Bucholz&gt;Foundations of Western Civilization II: A History of the Modern World, The Teaching Company, 2006, course guide, Accessed Oct 29, 2013, pp. 120–124&lt;/ref&gt; Clergy and aristocracy had special privileges, including preferential treatment in law courts, and were exempt from taxes; this last privilege had the effect of placing the burden of paying for national expenses on the peasantry.&lt;ref name = Bucholz/&gt; One scholar who examined pre-Revolutionary France described powerful groups which stifled citizenship and included provincial estates, guilds, military governors, courts with judges who owned their offices, independent church officials, proud nobles, financiers and tax farmers.&lt;ref name=tws2Y13rtr/&gt; They blocked citizenship indirectly since they kept a small elite governing group in power, and kept regular people away from participating in political decision-making.&lt;ref name=tws2Y13rtr&gt;{{Cite book

These arrangements changed substantially during and after the French Revolution. [[King Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] mismanaged funds, vacillated, was blamed for inaction during a famine, causing the French people to see the interest of the king and the national interest as opposed.&lt;ref name = Bucholz/&gt; During the early stages of the uprising, the abolition of aristocratic privilege happened during a pivotal meeting on August 4, 1789, in which an aristocrat named [[Vicomte de Noailles]] proclaimed before the National Assembly that he would renounce all special privileges and would henceforward be known only as the "Citizen of Noailles."&lt;ref name = Bucholz/&gt; Other aristocrats joined him which helped to dismantle the Ancien Regime's seignorial rights during "one night of heated oratory", according to one historian.&lt;ref name = Bucholz/&gt; Later that month, the Assembly's [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen]] linked the concept of [[rights]] with [[citizenship]] and asserted that rights of man were "natural, inalienable, and sacred", that all men were "born free and equal, and that the aim of all political association is maintenance of their rights", according to historian Robert Bucholz.&lt;ref name = Bucholz/&gt; However, the document said nothing about the rights of women, although activist [[Olympe de Gouge]] issued a proclamation two years later which argued that women were born with equal rights to men.&lt;ref name = Bucholz/&gt; People began to identify a new loyalty to the nation as a whole, as citizens, and the idea of [[popular sovereignty]] earlier espoused by the thinker [[Jean Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] took hold, along with strong feelings of [[nationalism]]. Louis XVI and his wife were guillotined.

Citizenship became more inclusive and democratic, aligned with [[rights]] and national membership.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; The king's government was replaced with an [[bureaucracy|administrative hierarchy]] at all levels, from a national legislature to even power at the local commune, such that power ran both up and down the chain of command.&lt;ref name=tws2Y13rtr/&gt; Loyalty became a cornerstone in the concept of citizenship, according to Peter Riesenberg.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; One analyst suggested that in the French Revolution, two often polar-opposite versions of citizenship merged: (1) the abstract idea of citizenship as [[equality before the law]] caused by the centralizing and rationalizing policies of absolute monarchs and (2) the idea of citizenship as a privileged status reserved for rule-makers, brought forth defensively by an aristocratic elite guarding its exclusiveness.&lt;ref name=tws2Y13qwq/&gt;{{rp|271}} According to one view by the German philosopher [[Max Stirner]], the Revolution emancipated the citizen but not the individual, since the individuals were not the agents of change, but only the collective force of all individuals; in Stirner's sense, the "agent of change" was effectively the nation.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|168}} The British thinker [[Thomas Humphrey Marshall|T. H. Marshall]] saw in the 18th century "serious growth" of civil rights, with major growth in the legal aspects of citizenship, often defended through courts of law.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14uuiu/&gt; These civil rights extended citizenship's legal dimensions: they included the right to [[free speech]], the [[right to a fair trial]], and generally equal access to the legal system.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14uuiu/&gt; Marshall saw the 18th century as signifying [[civil rights]] which was a precursor to [[Civil and political rights|political right]]s such as [[suffrage]], and later, in the 20th century, [[social rights]] such as [[welfare]].&lt;ref name=tws2Y22/&gt;{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=7}}

After 1750, states such as [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[France]] invested in massive armies and navies which were so expensive to maintain that the option of hiring mercenary soldiers became less attractive.&lt;ref name=tws2Y13rtr/&gt; Rulers found troops within the public, and taxed the public to pay for these troops, but one account suggested that the military buildup had a side-effect of undermining the military's autonomous political power.&lt;ref name=tws2Y13rtr/&gt; Another view corroborates the idea that [[conscription|military conscription]] spurred development of a broader role for citizens.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|153}}

A phenomenon known as the [[public sphere]] arose, according to philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]], as a space between authority and [[private sphere|private life]] in which citizens could meet informally, exchange views on public matters, criticize government choices and suggest reforms. It happened in physical spaces such as [[public square]]s as well as in coffeehouses, museums, restaurants, as well as in [[Medium (communication)|media]] such as newspapers, journals, and dramatic performances. It served as a counterweight to government, a check on its power, since a bad ruling could be criticized by the public in places such as [[editorial]]s. According to Schudson, the public sphere was a "playing field for citizenship".&lt;ref name=tws2Y19/&gt;{{rp|12}}

===Eastern conceptions===
In the late-19th century, thinking about citizenship began to influence [[China]]. Discussion started of ideas (such as legal limits, definitions of monarchy and the state, parliaments and elections, an active press, public opinion) and of concepts (such as [[civic virtue]], national unity, and social progress).{{sfn|Zarrow|1997|p=3}}{{qn|date=May 2016}}

Nationalism emerged. Many thinkers suggest that notions of citizenship rights emerged from this spirit of each person identifying strongly with the nation of their birth.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|137}} A modern type of citizenship is one which lets people participate in a number of different ways.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; Citizenship is not a "be-all end-all" relation, but only one of many types of relationships which a person might have.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt; It has been seen as an "equalizing principle" in the sense that most other people have the same status.&lt;ref name=tws2Y13qwq/&gt; One theory sees different types of citizenship emanating out from concentric circles—from the town, to the state, to the world—and that citizenship can be studied by looking at which types of relations people value at any one time.&lt;ref name=tws2Y12/&gt;

The idea that participating in lawmaking is an essential aspect of citizenship continues to be expressed by different thinkers. For example, British journalist and [[pamphleteer]] [[William Cobbett]] said that the "greatest right", which he called the "right of rights", was having a share in the "making of the laws", and then submitting the laws to the "good of the whole."&lt;ref name=tws2Y13/&gt;

===Citizenship today===
The concept of citizenship is hard to isolate, since it relates to many other contextual aspects of society such as the [[family]], [[military service]], the individual, freedom, [[religion]], ideas of [[ethics|right and wrong]], [[ethnicity]], and patterns for how a person should behave in society.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt; According to British politician [[Douglas Hurd]], citizenship is essentially doing [[good and evil|good]] to others.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14qwea/&gt; When there are many different ethnic and religious groups within a nation, citizenship may be the only real bond which unites everybody as equals without discrimination—it is a "broad bond" as one writer described it.&lt;ref name=tws2Y15/&gt; Citizenship links "a person with the state" and gives people a universal identity—as a legal member of a nation—besides their identity based on ties of ethnicity or an ethnic self.&lt;ref name=tws2Y15/&gt;

But clearly there are wide differences between ancient conceptions of citizenship and modern ones. While the modern one still respects the idea of participation in the political process, it is usually done through "elaborate systems of political representation at a distance" such as [[representative democracy]], and carried out under the "shadow of a permanent professional administrative apparatus."&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; Unlike the ancient patterns, modern citizenship is much more passive; action is delegated to others; citizenship is often a constraint on acting, not an impetus to act.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; Nevertheless, citizens are aware of their obligations to authorities, and they are aware that these bonds "limits their personal political autonomy in a quite profound manner".&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; But there are disagreements that the contrast between ancient and modern versions of citizenship was that sharp; one theorist suggested that the supposedly "modern" aspects of so-called passive citizenship, such as tolerance, respect for others, and simply "minding one's own business", were present in ancient times too.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt;

Citizenship can be seen as both a status and an ideal.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt; Sometimes mentioning the idea of citizenship implies a host of theories as well as the possibility of [[social reform]], according to one view.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt; It invokes a model of what a person should do in relation to the state, and suggests education or punishment for those who stray from the model.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|p.150}}

Several thinkers see the modern notion of [[individualism]] as being sometimes consistent with citizenship, and other times opposed to it.&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt; Accordingly, the ''modern individual'' and the ''modern citizen'' seem to be the same, but too much individualism can have the effect of leading to a "crisis of citizenship".&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|p.160}} Another agreed that individualism can corrupt citizenship.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|p.165}} Another sees citizenship as a substantial dilemma between the individual and society, and between the individual and the state, and asked questions such as whether the focus of a person's efforts should be on the collective good or on the individual good?&lt;ref name=tws2Y17/&gt;&lt;ref name=tws2Y15/&gt; In a [[Marxist]] view, the individual and the citizen were both "essentially necessary" to each other in that neither could exist without the other, but both aspects within a person were essentially antagonistic to each other.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|168}} [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]] suggested in his book ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'' that while citizenship widened to include more people, the [[public sphere]] shrunk and became commercialized, devoid of serious debate, with media coverage of political campaigns having less focus on issues and more focus on [[sound bite]]s and [[political scandal]]s, and in the process, citizenship became more common but meant less. Political participation declined for most people.

[[File:OathofCitizenship5.jpg|thumb|right|Oath of citizenship ceremony in [[Canada]].]]
Other thinkers echo that citizenship is a vortex for competing ideas and currents, sometimes working against each other, sometimes working in harmony. For example, [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Thomas Humphrey Marshall|T. H. Marshall]] suggested that citizenship was a contradiction between the "formal political equality of the franchise" and the "persistence of extensive social and economic inequality."&lt;ref name=tws2Y14uuiu&gt;{{Cite book

Marshall, UCL Press: London. p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blyton, P. (1982). T.H. Marshall 1893-1981. International Social Science Journal. Vol. 91(1), pp. 157–158.&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall saw citizenship as the basis for awarding social rights, and he made a case that extending such rights would not jeopardize the structure of social classes or end [[equality of outcome|inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, T.H. (1960). "Sociology - The Road Ahead." In T.H. Marshall (editor) (1965). Class, Citizenship, and Social Development. 2nd ed. Garden City, New York: Anchor Books. pp. 28–33.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw [[capitalism]] as a dynamic system with constant clashes between citizenship and social class, and how these clashes played out determined how a society's political and social life would manifest themselves.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14uuiu/&gt;

Citizenship was not always about including everybody, but was also a powerful force to exclude persons at the margins of society, such as the outcasts, illegal immigrants and others.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|136–137}} In this sense, citizenship was not only about getting rights and entitlements but it was a struggle to "reject claims of entitlement by those initially residing outside the core, and subsequently, of migrant and immigrant labour."&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|136–137}} But one thinker described democratic citizenship as inclusive, generally, and wrote that democratic citizenship:

{{Quote|... (democratic citizenship) extends human, political and civil rights to all inhabitants, regardless of race, religion, ethnicity, or culture. In a civic state, which is based on the concept of such citizenship, even foreigners are protected by the rule of law."|Feliks Gross, 1999&lt;ref name=tws2Y15/&gt;}}

The ''liberal-individualist'' conception of citizenship, or sometimes merely the ''liberal'' conception, has a concern that the individual's status may be undermined by government.

The conception suggests a focus on the manufacture of material things as well as man's economic vitality, with society seen as a "market-based association of competitive individuals."&lt;ref name=tws2Y18/&gt; From this view, citizens are sovereign, morally autonomous beings with duties to pay taxes, obey the law, engage in business transactions, and defend the nation if it comes under attack,&lt;ref name=tws2Y14qwea/&gt; but are essentially passive politically.&lt;ref name=tws2Y18/&gt; This conception of citizenship has sometimes been termed ''conservative'' in the sense that passive citizens want to conserve their private interests, and that private people have a right to be left alone.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14uuiu/&gt; This formulation of citizenship was expressed somewhat in the philosophy of [[John Rawls]], who believed that every person in a society has an "equal right to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties" and that society has an obligation to try to benefit the "least advantaged members of society".&lt;ref name=tws2Y21yy&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this sense of citizenship has been criticized; according to one view, it can lead to a "culture of subjects" with a "degeneration of public spirit" since ''economic man'', or [[homo economicus]], is too focused on material pursuits to engage in civic activity to be true citizens.&lt;ref name=tws2Y22/&gt;&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|p.167}}

====Civic-republican view====
A competing vision is that democratic citizenship may be founded on a "culture of participation". This orientation has sometimes been termed the ''civic-republican'' or ''classical'' conception of citizenship since it focuses on the importance of people practicing citizenship actively and finding places to do this.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14qwea/&gt; Unlike the liberal-individualist conception, the civic-republican conception emphasizes man's political nature, and sees citizenship as an active, not passive, activity.&lt;ref name=tws2Y18/&gt; A general problem with this conception, according to critics, is that if this model is implemented, it may bring about other issues such as the [[free rider problem]] in which some people neglect basic citizenship duties and consequently get a free ride supported by the citizenship efforts of others.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|p.167}} This view emphasizes the democratic participation inherent in citizenship, and can "channel legitimate frustrations and grievances" and bring people together to focus on matters of common concern and lead to a politics of empowerment, according to theorist Dora Kostakopoulou.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14ytr/&gt; Like the liberal-individualist conception, it is concerned about government running roughshod over individuals, but unlike the liberal-individualist conception, it is relatively more concerned that government will interfere with popular places to practice citizenship in the [[public sphere]], rather than take away or lessen particular citizenship rights.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14qwea/&gt; This sense of citizenship has been described as "active and public citizenship", and has sometimes been called a "revolutionary idea".&lt;ref name=tws2Y14uuiu/&gt; According to one view, most people today live as citizens according to the liberal-individualist conception but wished they lived more according to the civic-republican ideal.&lt;ref name=tws2Y18/&gt;

The subject of citizenship, including political discussions about what exactly the term describes, can be a battleground for [[ideology|ideological]] debates.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14ytr/&gt; In [[Canada]], ''citizenship'' and related issues such as [[civic education]] are "hotly contested."&lt;ref name=tws2Y16/&gt; There continues to be sentiment within the academic community that trying to define one "unitary theory of citizenship" which would describe citizenship in every society, or even in any one society, would be a meaningless exercise.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14ytr/&gt; Citizenship has been described as "multi-layered belongings"—different attachments, different bonds and allegiances.&lt;ref name=tws2Y16/&gt; This is the view of Hebert &amp; Wilkinson who suggest there is not one single perspective on citizenship but "multiple citizenship" relations since each person belongs to many different groups which define him or her.&lt;ref name=tws2Y16/&gt;

:#The colonial era was marked by property-owning white males who delegated authority to "gentlemen", and almost all people did not participate as ''citizens'' according to his research.&lt;ref name=tws2Y19/&gt;{{rp|p.5}} Early elections didn't generate much interest, were characterized by low voter turnout,&lt;ref name=tws2Y19/&gt;{{rp|p.17}}&lt;ref&gt;Jane Mansbridge, Beyond Adversary Democracy (New York: Basic Books, 1980), pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt; and rather reflected an existing social hierarchy.&lt;ref name=tws2Y19/&gt;{{rp|p.12}} Representative assemblies "barely existed" in the 18th century, according to Schudson.&lt;ref name=tws2Y19/&gt;{{rp|13}}
:#[[Political parties in the United States|Political parties]] became prominent in the 19th century to win lucrative patronage jobs, and ''citizenship'' meant party loyalty.&lt;ref name=tws2Y19/&gt;{{rp|5–6}}
:#The 20th century citizenship ideal was having an "informed voter", choosing rationally (ie voting) based on information from sources such as newspapers and books.&lt;ref name=tws2Y19/&gt;{{rp|6–7, 183}}
:#Citizenship came to be seen as a basis for [[rights]] and entitlements from government. Schudson predicted the emergence of what he called the ''monitorial citizen'': persons engaged in watching for issues such as corruption and government violations of rights.&lt;ref name=tws2Y19/&gt;{{rp|311}}

Schudson chronicled changing patterns in which citizenship expanded to include formerly disenfranchised groups such as [[women]] and [[minorities]] while parties declined.&lt;ref name=tws2Y19/&gt;{{rp|p.275}} Interest groups influenced legislators directly via [[Lobbying in the United States|lobbying]].&lt;ref name=tws2Y19/&gt;{{rp|278}} Politics retreated to being a peripheral concern for citizens&lt;ref name=tws2Y19/&gt;{{rp|p.240}} who were often described as "self-absorbed".&lt;ref name=tws2Y19/&gt;{{rp|241}}

In the 21st-century [[United States|America]], citizenship is generally considered to be a legal marker recognizing that a person is an American. ''Duty'' is generally not part of citizenship. Citizens generally do not see themselves as having a ''duty'' to provide assistance to one another, although officeholders are seen as having a duty to the public.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14/&gt;{{rp|171}} Rather, citizenship is a bundle of rights which includes being able to get assistance from the federal government. A similar pattern marks the idea of citizenship in many western-style nations. Most Americans do not think much about citizenship except perhaps when applying for a [[passport]] and traveling internationally. Feliks Gross sees 20th century America as an "efficient, pluralistic and civic system that extended equal rights to all citizens, irrespective of race, ethnicity and religion."&lt;ref name=tws2Y15/&gt; According to Gross, the US can be considered as a "model of a modern civic and democratic state" although [[discrimination]] and [[prejudice]] still survive.&lt;ref name=tws2Y15/&gt; The exception, of course, is that persons living within the borders of America illegally see citizenship as a major issue.

Nevertheless, one of the constants is that scholars and thinkers continue to agree that the concept of ''citizenship'' is hard to define, and lacks a precise meaning.&lt;ref name=tws2Y14&gt;{{Cite book

Pichler studied law at the Universities of Vienna and Salzburg, where he earned his doctorate degree in 1971. Afterwards, he worked as assistant professor for legal history at the [[University of Salzburg]], before he became Full Professor for European Legal Development at the University of Graz in 1994, where he holds the chair for ''Development of European law'' at the University of Graz. Since 1986, he leads the independent research institute ''Austrian Institute for European Law and Policy'' in Salzburg, which focuses on European legal policy since 2008. In these capacities, his research focused on acceptance of law, certainty of justice on the internet, family and marriage law, healthcare law, industrial law, youth law and patients' rights.&lt;ref&gt;http://legalpolicy.org/2013/04/24/prior-projects-fruhere-projekte/&lt;/ref&gt;

Pichler is chairman of the association ''Europe needs initiative'' and member of the advisory council of the ''Initiative and Referendum Institute Europe'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iri-europe.org/about/members/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014040503/http://www.iri-europe.org/about/members/ |archivedate=2013-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both associations were instrumental for the introduction of the [[European Citizens' Initiative]] in 2012. Johannes Pichler is also a member of the advisory council for the law symposium of the [[European Forum Alpbach]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alpbach.org/en/person/johannes-pichler/&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1999, he was a member of the Austrian Peoples' Party ([[ÖVP]]), but left the party out of protest against the coalition with the Freedom Party of Austria([[FPÖ]]).

He is married, has three children, and lives in Graz and Salzburg.

In '''''Kidwell v The Master''''', an important case in the South African law of succession, the [[testator]] had signed right at the bottom of the [[Will and testament|will]]; there was about {{Convert|17|cm|in}} between the end of the will (which included the witnesses’ [[Signature|signatures]]) and the testator’s signature. The question before the court was where the end of the will was. The court held that the will was invalid as it did not comply with section 2(1)(a)(i) of the [[Wills Act]]. The decision has been criticised as overly formalistic by some commentators, who believe the overriding criteria for the courts should be to give effect to the wishes of the testator, and this case did not do this over something seemingly insignificant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparative Succession Law: Volume 1: Testamentary Formalities|last=|first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780191029714|location=|pages=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand French|Loi du 20 mai 1802|date=January 2009}}
The French '''Law of 20 May 1802''' was passed that day (30 floréal year X), revoking the [[Law of 4 February 1794]] (16 pluviôse) which had abolished [[slavery]] in all the [[French colonial empire|French colonies]]. That law had not taken effect in many of the colonies, with [[La Réunion]] hindering its implementation. [[Martinique]] refused to ratify it due to a royalist insurrection there, similar to that in the [[War in the Vendée|Vendée]], which had been in revolt since 16 September 1793 and had, represented by planter Louis-François Dubuc, signed the [[Whitehall Accord (1794)|Whitehall accord]] of submission to England. On 6 February 1794 the English began their [[History of Martinique#French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars|military conquest of Martinique]], completed on 21 March 1794, and thus the island avoided the abolition of slavery.

The Law of 20 May 1802 explicitly concerned the territories that had not been applied the 1794 law and was linked to the 1802 [[Treaty of Amiens]] which restored Martinique to France. The 1802 law thus did not apply to [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Guyane]]. [[Napoleon]]'s position was more characterised by pragmatism than by any 'ideological' inclination.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Adélaïde, La Caraïbe et la Guyane au temps de la Révolution et de l'Empire (1992), Ed. Karthala, {{ISBN|2-86537-342-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law had little effect in [[Saint-Domingue]] except to re-inflame rebellion and accelerate its march towards independence in 1804 – on 24 July 1802 general [[Charles Leclerc|Leclerc]] (commander of the [[Saint-Domingue expedition]]) wrote to admiral [[Denis Decrès]] inviting him to renounce all attempts to restore slavery to Saint Domingue.

[[Joséphine de Beauharnais]]'s intervention in favour of re-establishing slavery is probably a myth, since there is no evidence for it, she had little political influence over Napoleon and her pro-slavery bias has not been clearly demonstrated. The maintenance and re-imposition of slavery was far more influenced by Britain and her allies.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''Maine Question 1''' was a [[people's veto]] referendum that appeared on the June 12, 2018 statewide ballot. It sought to repeal a law passed by the [[Maine Legislature]] that suspended the implementation of [[ranked choice voting]], authorized by Maine voters in a [[Maine Question 5, 2016|previous referendum]], for use in Maine elections until and if an amendment to the Maine Constitution is passed to expressly permit it; failing that, the law would be automatically repealed in 2021. It qualified because supporters of the original referendum collected the necessary number of signatures from registered Maine voters. This vote coincided with [[primary election]]s in which party nominees for [[Maine gubernatorial election, 2018|governor]], [[United States Senate election in Maine, 2018|U.S. Senate]], [[United States House of Representatives elections in Maine, 2018|U.S. House]], and the Maine Legislature were chosen to run in general elections on November 6. 

The people's veto was passed, with 53.88% of Maine voters voting Yes.  This restored ranked choice voting for primary and federal elections.

== Background ==
On November 8, 2016, Maine voters passed [[Maine Question 5, 2016|Question 5]], a citizen referendum to implement [[ranked choice voting]] (RCV). Supporters expected RCV to be in place for 2018's elections, but on May 23, 2017, the [[Maine Supreme Judicial Court]] issued an [[advisory opinion]] at the request of the [[Maine Senate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mainepublic.org/post/maine-senate-asks-high-court-opinion-voter-approved-ranked-choice-initiative#stream/0|title=Maine Senate Asks High Court for Opinion on Voter-Approved Ranked-Choice Initiative |publisher=[[MPBN]]|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that RCV in general elections for state offices would be held unconstitutional if it came before the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3728801-Maine-Supreme-Judicial-Court-ruling-on-Ranked.html |title=Opinion of the Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court |date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The opinion did not affect elections for federal offices or primary elections for state offices. RCV opponents subsequently called for the law establishing RCV to be repealed, while supporters called for a vote on a constitutional amendment to permit the law. On October 23, 2017, the Legislature voted to delay implementation of the RCV law for all races until 2021. If a constitutional amendment was not passed by that point, the law would be repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcsh6.com/news/politics/loose-ends-bring-legislature-back-for-special-session/485282422 |title=Ranked choice voting delayed until 2021 |publisher=WCSH6.com |date=2017-10-23 |accessdate=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unhappy with the delay, RCV supporters launched a [[people's veto]] signature-gathering effort to prevent it, pointing to RCV's successful use in mixed-race ballots in Portland. On November 6, 2017, the petition forms were approved after Governor [[Paul LePage]] waited the full 10 days he is permitted by law to allow the delay to take effect without his signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcsh6.com/news/local/backers-of-ranked-choice-voting-say-theyll-fight-lawmakers-delay/485777607|title=Backers of ranked choice voting say they'll fight the lawmakers' delay |date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2017/11/06/ranked-choice-voting-supporters-to-begin-peoples-veto-campaign-tuesday/|title=Ranked-choice voting supporters to begin ‘people’s veto’ campaign today |date=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 12 the effort's leaders said they had collected half the signatures needed and set a goal of finishing by December 15, though by law they had 90 days from when they started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2017/11/12/campaign-to-restore-maine-ranked-choice-voting-collects-over-half-the-signatures-needed-for-a-peoples-veto/|title=Campaign to restore Maine ranked-choice voting collects over half the signatures needed for a people’s veto |date=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2018, RCV Maine turned in over 80,000 signatures to [[Maine Secretary of State]] [[Matthew Dunlap]] for verification. The signatures were gathered despite the coldest weather in years occurring during the gathering period. This suspended the Legislature's delay of RCV pending the outcome of the vote, meaning it would be used in the June primary elections. Dunlap said his office was exploring strategies for implementation of RCV but that it was challenging since the Legislature had not given him additional resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressherald.com/2018/02/02/ranked-choice-voters-submit-signatures-for-peoples-veto-ballot-initiative/|title=Ranked-choice voters submit signatures for ‘people’s veto’ ballot initiative |date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5 Dunlap announced that approximately 66,000 signatures had been verified, more than the 61,000 needed to place a question on the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mainepublic.org/post/mainers-test-ranked-choice-voting-while-deciding-whether-keep-it|title=Mainers To Test Ranked-Choice Voting While Deciding Whether To Keep It |date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The question that appeared on the ballot was "Do you want to reject the parts of a new law that would delay the use of ranked-choice voting in the election of candidates for any state or federal office until 2022, and then retain the method only if the constitution is amended by December 1, 2021, to allow ranked-choice voting for candidates in state elections?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/upcoming/index.html Department of the Secretary of State, Bureau of Corporations, Elections, and Commissions]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RCV status ===
A people's veto effort suspends the law under dispute until the result of the vote is determined. Supporters have asserted this means that the [[Maine Question 5, 2016|law voters passed in 2016]] establishing RCV should be implemented in a manner consistent with the Maine Supreme Judicial Court ruling. On March 29, 2018, Dunlap told a [[Maine Legislature]] committee hearing that in this case that means the original law is in effect, requiring the original [[first-past-the-post]] system for the upcoming primaries, unless the Legislature passes an emergency change to the law or a court tells him otherwise. Dunlap said he needed clarity on the issue by April 2 so overseas ballots could be printed and sent as federal law requires. Passage of a new law seemed unlikely, as it would need a 2/3 vote to pass the Legislature as an emergency measure. [[Maine Attorney General]] [[Janet T. Mills]] urged the Legislature to pass a new law, saying that the signers of the people's veto petition should not be thwarted by a technicality. RCV supporters said they would seek a court injunction to order the use of RCV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mainepublic.org/post/dunlap-ranked-choice-voting-cant-be-used-june-primaries-unless-lawmakers-or-courts-act|title=Dunlap: Ranked-Choice Voting Can't Be Used In June Primaries Unless Lawmakers Or Courts Act|date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 4 Judge Michaela Murphy ruled that Dunlap should proceed with efforts to implement RCV for the June primaries while the issues with the law are heard by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.centralmaine.com/2018/04/04/judge-orders-maine-to-use-ranked-choice-voting-for-june-primaries/|title=Judge orders state to use ranked-choice voting for June primaries, but disputes continue|date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate case, the [[Maine Senate]] voted 21-13 to direct Senate President [[Michael Thibodeau]] to seek intervenor status with the court in the RCV case. Majority Senate Republicans claim that Thibodeau would have [[standing (law)|standing]] to intervene as the Senate has a duty to defend the Maine Constitution. They additionally argued that the Legislature has not approved funding specifically for RCV, and that chaos could result if losing candidates in elections began to file lawsuits over the use of RCV. Democrats rejected those arguments, stating that Republicans were cherry-picking parts of the Constitution and ignoring the parts that permit citizens to pass laws at the ballot box, and pointed out that Dunlap has the authority and funding to hold elections in general. They added that the Senate is only part of the legislative branch and that more would be needed for standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pressherald.com/2018/04/02/maine-senate-takes-unusual-step-of-seeking-to-intervene-in-ranked-choice-voting-case/?rel=related|title=Maine Senate takes unusual step of asking court to hear its concerns about ranked-choice voting|date=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18 the [[Maine Supreme Judicial Court]] removed the last legal roadblocks to using RCV in primary elections, upholding the lower court ruling. It also declined to hear Thibodeau's appeal, saying it would not hear a political dispute from one half of one body of the Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mainepublic.org/post/ranked-choice-voting-be-implemented-june-primaries-political-struggles-continue|title=Ranked-Choice Voting To Be Implemented For June Primaries, But Political Struggles Continue|date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4 the [[Maine Republican Party]] filed a federal lawsuit in U.S. District Court in [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]] seeking to bar the use of RCV in its own primary, on the grounds that the party has a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to choose its nominee as it sees fit.&lt;ref name=lawsuit&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://mainepublic.org/post/gop-files-suit-block-ranked-choice-voting |title=GOP Files Suit To Block Ranked-Choice Voting |last=Leary |first=Mal |date=May 4, 2018 |work=[[MPBN]] |access-date=May 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. District Court Judge Jon Levy rejected the suit on May 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://mainepublic.org/post/judge-maine-gop-must-use-ranked-choice-voting-primary|title=Judge: Maine GOP Must Use Ranked-Choice Voting In Primary |last=Leary |first=Mal |date=May 29, 2018 |work=[[MPBN]] |access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nano House''' was named to be the world's smallest sustainable house. 

The Nano Living System is a Swiss made "[[green building|green]]" pre-engineered concept for residential use that presents an innovative and sustainable architectural proposition. The design was based on a combination of pre-engineered [[structural insulated panel|SIP]]s (made from cement fiberboard, recycled light gauge steel and [[polyurethane]] foam), creation of flexible spaces (through Nano Living Systems' "Suspending Technology") and use of [[renewable energy]] systems. This suggests an optimistic and environmental solution for the global housing issue of very small living spaces at extremely high prices.

The "Nano House" can be used by a family of three in an area consisting of {{convert|25|m2|sqft}}. This is made possible by the incorporation of the "suspending technology", which nearly doubles the size of the living area within this space by transforming what is common living space by day into two separate bedrooms by night. The "suspending technology" can be used in new construction and can also be adapted to be used in existing structures, such as hotels, studios, dormitories and very small housing.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the detainees who were determined not to have been enemy combatants were released right away.  Ten of the detainees who had been determined not to have been enemy combatants were allowed to move to the more comfortable [[Camp Iguana]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Others, such as [[Sami Al Laithi]], remained in solitary confinement.

Thirty-eight detainees were finally classified as NLECs.&lt;ref name=WapoNlec&gt;

The fifth [[Denbeaux study|Denbeaux report]], "[[No-hearing hearings]]", reported that an additional three Combatant Status Review Tribunals determined that captives should not have been determined to have been enemy combatants, only to have their recommendation overturned.&lt;ref name=Denbeaux061117&gt;
[[Mark Denbeaux]] et al.,
[http://law.shu.edu/news/final_no_hearing_hearings_report.pdf No-hearing hearings]", November 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Washington Post'' has published a list of the names of 30 of the 38 individuals who were determined not to have been enemy combatants.&lt;ref name="WapoNlec"/&gt;

The delay in the release of some of the detainees was due to considerations of their safety.  Some could not be returned to their home countries, out of fears of retaliation from their fellow citizens, or from the governments of their countries.  Some, like Al Laithi, were returned to their home countries after the US secured a promise that they would not be punished by their home countries.  Others, like five of the [[Uyghur detainees in Guantanamo]], were released when the US found a third country which would accept them.&lt;ref name=Bbc060506&gt;

[[H. Candace Gorman]], the pro bono lawyer for [[Abdel Hamid Ibn Abdussalem Ibn Mifta Al Ghazzawi]], expressed surprise when she learned that her client had initially been determined not to have been an enemy combatant, after all.&lt;ref name=HuffingtonPost061120&gt;

She was told that the justification for convening her client's second tribunal had been that the DoD had new evidence. However, when she reviewed the transcript of his second tribunal she found that there had been no new evidence.

[[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Stephen Abraham]] came forward and swore an affidavit, describing his experience sitting on Al Ghazzawi's tribunal.&lt;ref name=Cbs20070623&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3193">An '''opposition proceeding''' is an administrative process available under the [[patent]] and [[trademark]] law of many jurisdictions which allows third parties to formally challenge the validity of a pending patent application ("pre-grant opposition"), of a granted patent ("post-grant opposition"), or of a trademark.

==Patents==
{{Patent law}}
===European Patent Organisation===
{{main|Opposition procedure before the European Patent Office}}
In the context of the proceedings at the [[European Patent Office]] (EPO), third parties may dispute the validity of a granted European patent by filing a [[Opposition procedure before the European Patent Office|post-grant opposition]] under the [[European Patent Convention]] (EPC).&lt;ref name=a99epc&gt;{{EPC Article|99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term for filing an opposition with the EPO is nine months from the publication of the mention of the grant of the European patent in the [[European Patent Bulletin]].&lt;ref name=a99epc/&gt;

===United States===
Under [[United States patent law]], an opposition proceeding is called a [[reexamination]]. Post-grant review provisions of the new patent law may affect a potential [[patent infringement]] defendant’s strategies in filing a [[declaratory judgment]] action. Subsequent to the [[Leahy-Smith America Invents Act]] (2011), any third party can challenge the validity of an issued patent using either post-grant review under 35 U.S.C. § 321 or [[inter partes review]] under 35 U.S.C. § 311.  Both proceedings became effective September 16, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Post-Grant Review Aspect of New Patent Law | url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/post-grant-review-aspect-new-patent-law | work= The National Law Review | first= [[Andrews Kurth]] LLP| date= January 23, 2012 | accessdate=September 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trademarks==

In the case of trademarks, third parties may use opposition proceedings to "oppose" the acceptance of a trademark application after it has been accepted and published for opposition purposes. If an opposition is defeated the trademark will proceed to registration. Some jurisdictions operate a "post-grant" opposition system, whereby opposition is not possible until after registration (e.g. Japan).{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

A '''partnership''' is an arrangement where parties, known as [[business partners|partners]], agree to cooperate to advance their mutual interests. The partners in a partnership may be individuals, [[business entity|businesses]], [[interest]]-based [[organization]]s, [[school]]s, [[government]]s or combinations. [[Organization]]s may partner to increase the likelihood of each achieving their mission and to amplify their reach. A partnership may result in issuing and holding equity or may be only governed by a contract.

==History==

Partnerships have a long history; they were already in use in Medieval times in Europe and in the Middle East. 
In Europe, the partnerships contributed to the [[Commercial Revolution]] which started in the 13th century. In the 15th century the cities of the [[Hanseatic League]], would mutually strengthen each other; a ship from Hamburg to Danzig would not only carry its own cargo but was also commissioned to transport freight for other members of the league. This practice not only saved time and money, but also constituted a first step toward partnership. This capacity to join forces in reciprocal services became a distinctive feature, and a long lasting success factor, of the Hanseatic team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beerbühl|first1=Margrit Schulte|title=Networks of the Hanseatic League|url=http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/european-networks/economic-networks/margrit-schulte-beerbuehl-networks-of-the-hanseatic-league|website=EGO European History Online|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A close examination of Medieval trade in Europe shows that numerous significant credit based trades were not bearing interest. Hence, pragmatism and common sense called for a fair compensation for the risk of lending money, and a compensation for the opportunity cost of lending money without using it for other fruitful purposes. In order to circumvent the usury laws edicted by the Church, other forms of reward were created, in particular through the widespread form of partnership called ''commenda'', very popular with Italian merchant bankers.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Favier, Gold &amp; Spices: the rise of commerce in the middle ages, Holmes &amp; Meier Pub; 1st US edition, July 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Florentine [[merchant banks]] were almost sure to make a positive return on their loans, but this would be before taking into account solvency risks.

In the Middle East, the ''[[Qirad]]'' and ''Mudarabas'' institutions developed when trade with the Levant, namely the Ottoman Empire and the Muslim Near East, flourished and when early [[Trading company|trading companies]], [[contract]]s, [[bills of exchange]] and long-distance [[international trade]] were established.&lt;ref name=Banaji&gt;Jairus Banaji (2007), "Islam, the Mediterranean and the rise of capitalism", ''[[Historical Materialism (journal)|Historical Materialism]]'' '''15''' (1): 47–74, [[Brill Publishers]].&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Levant trade revived in the tenth to eleventh centuries in Byzantine Italy. The eastern and western Mediterranean formed part of a single commercial civilization in the Middle Ages, and the two regions were economically interdependent through trade (in varying degrees).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laiou|first1=Angeliki E.|title=The Economic History of Byzantium: From the Seventh through the Fifteenth Century|date=2008|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks|isbn=088402332X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Igp8hxsHV_AC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnership agreements==
Although not required by law, partners may benefit from a partnership agreement that defines the important terms of the relationship between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What Is a Partnership|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/partnership.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partnership agreements can be formed in the following areas: 
* Business: two or more companies join forces in a joint venture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bamford|first1=James|last2=Ernst|first2=David|last3=Fubini|first3=David G.|title=Launching a World-Class Joint Venture|url=https://hbr.org/2004/02/launching-a-world-class-joint-venture|publisher=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=3 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a consortium to i) work on a project (e.g. industrial or research project) which would be too heavy or too risky for a single entity, ii) join forces to have a stronger position on the market, iii) comply with specific regulation (e.g. in some emerging countries, foreigners can only invest in the form of partnerships with local entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coispeau|first1=Olivier|title=Mergers &amp; Acquisitions and Partnerships in China|date=18 May 2015|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co|isbn=9814641022|page=311|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/9789814641036_fmatter|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the alliance may be structured in a process comparable to a [[Mergers &amp; Acquisitions]] transaction.
* Politics (or geopolitics): In what is usually called an [[Political alliance|alliance]], governments may partner to achieve their national interests, sometimes against allied governments holding contrary interests, as occurred during [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]]. 
* Knowledge: In [[education]], [[Educational accreditation|accrediting agencies]] increasingly evaluate schools, or universities, by the level and quality of their partnerships with local or international peers and a variety of other entities across societal sectors. 
* Individual: Some partnerships occur at [[domestic partnership|personal levels]], such as when two or more individuals agree to domicile together, while other partnerships are not only personal, but private, known only to the involved parties.

Partnerships present the involved parties with complex negotiation and special challenges that must be navigated unto agreement. Overarching goals, levels of give-and-take, areas of responsibility, lines of authority and [[Succession planning|succession]], how success is evaluated and distributed, and often a variety of other factors must all be negotiated. Once agreement is reached, the partnership is typically enforceable by [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]], especially if well documented. Partners who wish to make their agreement affirmatively explicit and enforceable typically draw up [[Articles of Partnership]]. Trust and pragmatism are also essential as it cannot be expected that everything can be written in the initial partnership agreement, therefore quality governance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zadek|first1=Simon|last2=Radovich|first2=Sacha|title=Governing collaborative governance|journal=John F. Kennedy School of Government|date=April 2006|url=https://sites.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/CSRI/publications/workingpaper_23_zadek_radovich.pdf|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and clear communication are critical success factors in the long run. It is common for information about formally partnered entities to be made public, such as through a press release, a newspaper ad, or public records laws.

While industrial partnerships stand to amplify mutual interests and accelerate success, some forms of collaboration may be considered ethically problematic. When a politician, for example, partners with a corporation to advance the latter's interest in exchange for some benefit, a [[conflict of interest]] results; consequentially, the [[public good]] may suffer. While technically lawful in some jurisdictions, such practice is broadly viewed negatively or as [[corruption]].

==Partner compensation==
Partner compensation will often be defined by the terms of a partnership agreement. Partners who work for the partnership may receive compensation for their labor before any division of profits between partners.

===Equity vs. salaried partners===
In certain partnerships of individuals, particularly [[law firm]]s and [[accountancy]] firms, '''equity partners''' are distinguished from '''salaried partners''' (or '''contract or income partners'''). The degree of control which each type of partner exerts over the partnership depends on the relevant [[partnership agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Serrill-Robins|first1=Mira|title=Equity vs. Non-Equity Partnerships|url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/lexis-hub/b/careerguidance/archive/2010/03/15/equity-vs-non-equity-partner-what-the-difference-means-to-you.aspx|website=LexisNexis Legal Newsroom|publisher=Relx Group|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An equity partner is a part-owner of the [[business]], and is entitled to a proportion of the distributable [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] of the partnership.
* A salaried partner who is paid a [[salary]] but does not have any underlying ownership interest in the business and will not share in the [[dividend|distributions]] of the partnership (although it is quite common for salaried partners to receive a bonus based on the firm's profitability).

Although individuals in both categories are described as partners, equity partners and salaried partners have little in common other than [[joint and several liability]]. In many legal systems, salaried partners are not technically "partners" at all in the eyes of the law. However, if their firm holds them out as partners, they are nonetheless subject to joint and several liability.

In their most basic form, equity partners enjoy a fixed share of the partnership (usually, but not always an equal share with the other partners) and, upon distribution of profits, receive a portion of the partnership's profits proportionate to that share. In more sophisticated partnerships, different models exist for determining either ownership interest, profit distribution, or both. Two common alternate approaches to distribution of profit are "[[lockstep compensation|lockstep]]" and "[[Merit pay|source of origination]]" [[remuneration|compensation]] (sometimes referred to, more graphically, as "eat what you kill").&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Norman|title=Better carrots for partner compensation strategies|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=b1849e63-a519-4da7-979c-0753525fef6b|website=Lexology|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lockstep involves new partners joining the partnership with a certain number of "points". As time passes, they accrue additional points, until they reach a set maximum sometimes referred to as a plateau. The length of time it takes to reach the maximum is often used to describe the firm (so, for example, one could say that one firm has a "seven-year lockstep" and another has a "ten-year lockstep" depending on the length of time it takes to reach maximum equity).
*Source of origination involves the compensation of profits according to a formula that takes into consideration the amount of revenue and profit generated by each partner, such that partners who generate more revenue receive a greater share of the partnership's distributed profit.

===Law firms===
Source of origination compensation is rarely seen outside of law firms. The principle is simply that each partner receives a share of the partnership profits up to a certain amount, with any additional profits being distributed to the partner who was responsible for the "origination" of the work that generated the profits.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt;

British law firms tend to use the lockstep principle, whereas American firms are more accustomed to source of origination. When British firm [[Clifford Chance]] merged with American firm [[Rogers &amp; Wells]], many of the difficulties associated with that [[merger]] were blamed on the difficulties of merging a lockstep culture with a source of origination culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Becker|first1=Amanda|title=Law firm merger activity picks up|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/02/AR2010070204907.html|accessdate=22 September 2017|publisher=Washington Post|date=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxation==
Partnerships recognized by a government body may enjoy special benefits from [[Tax policy|taxation policy]]. Among developed countries, for example, business partnerships are often favored over [[corporation]]s in taxation policy, since [[dividend tax]]es only occur on profit before they are distributed to the partners. However, depending on the partnership structure and the [[jurisdiction]] in which it operates, owners of a partnership may be exposed to greater [[personal liability]] than they would as [[shareholder]]s of a corporation. In such countries, partnerships are often regulated via [[anti-trust]] laws, so as to inhibit [[monopoly|monopolistic practices]] and foster [[Market economy|free market competition]]. Enforcement of the laws, however, varies considerably. Domestic partnerships recognized by governments typically enjoy tax benefits, as well.

==Common law==
At [[common law]], members of a business partnership are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. Forms of partnership have evolved that may limit a partner's liability.

===Forms of partnership===
As [[common law]] there are two basic forms of partnership:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partnership|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/small/Op-Qu/Partnership.html|website=Reference for Business|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[general partnership]]: a partnership in which all partners manage the business and are personally liable for its debts. General partners have an obligation of [[strict liability]] to third parties injured by the Partnership. General partners may have [[joint liability]] or [[joint and several liability]] depending upon circumstances.
#[[limited partnership]] (LP): a partnership in which general partners manage the partnership's operations, and limited partners forego the right to manage the business in exchange for [[limited liability]] for the partnership debts. The liability of limited partners is limited to their investment in the partnership.

More recently, additional forms of partnership have been recognized:
*[[limited liability partnership]] (LLP): a form of partnership in which all partners may have some degree of limited liability.
* [[limited liability limited partnership]] (LLLP): a form of limited partnership in which general partners have limited liability for the debts and obligations of the limited partnership.

===Silent partners===
A '''''silent partner''''' is one who still shares in the profits and losses of the business, but who is not involved in its management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silent partner|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/silent_partner|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the silent partner's interest in the business will not be publicly known. A silent partner is often an investor in the partnership, who is entitled to a share of the partnership's profits. Silent partners may prefer to invest in limited partnerships in order to insulate their personal assets from the debts or liabilities of the partnership.

Summarising s. 5 of the ''[[Partnership Act 1958]]'' (Vic) (hereinafter the "Act"), for a partnership in Australia to exist, four main criteria must be satisfied. They are:
* Valid Agreement between the parties;
* To carry on a business – this is defined in s. 3 as "any trade, occupation or profession";
* In Common – meaning there must be some mutuality of rights, interests and obligations;
* View to Profit – thus charitable organizations cannot be partnerships (charities are typically incorporated associations under ''Associations Incorporations Act 1981'' (Vic))
Partners share profits and losses. A partnership is basically a settlement between two or more groups or firms in which profit and loss are equally divided

===Bangladesh===
In Bangladesh, the relevant law for regulating partnership is the Partnership Act 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Partnership Act, 1932|url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/pdf_part.php?id=157|website=Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division|publisher=Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partnership is defined as the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Section 4 of the Partnership Act 1932|url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/pdf_part.php?id=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law does not require written partnership agreement between the partners to form a partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goni|first1=Osman|title=Should you register your partnership?|url=https://osmangoni.com/register-partnership/|website=Osman Goni|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partnership does not also required to be registered, however an unregistered partnership has a number of limitation regarding enforcing its rights in any court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Should you register your partnership?|url=https://osmangoni.com/register-partnership/|website=Osman Goni|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partnership is considered as a separate legal identity (i.e. separate from its owners) in Bangladesh only if the partnership is registered. There must be a minimum of 2 partners and maximum of 20 partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to start a partnership business in Bangladesh - OGR Legal|url=https://resource.ogrlegal.com/partnership-in-bangladesh/|website=Resource Portal of OGR Legal|publisher=OGR Legal|accessdate=29 April 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Statutory regulation of partnerships in Canada fall under [[Constitution Act, 1867|provincial jurisdiction]]. A partnership is not a separate legal entity and partnership income is taxed at the rate of the partner receiving the income. It can be deemed to exist regardless of the intention of the partners. Common elements considered by courts in determining the existence of a partnership are that two or more legal persons:
*Are carrying on a business
*In common
*With a view to profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 1: Partnerships – Am I in One and Why Does it Matter?|url=http://www.uvicblc.ca/2012/03/part-1-partnerships-am-i-in-one-and-why-does-it-matter/|website=Business Law Clinic|publisher=University of Victoria, Faculty of Law|accessdate=22 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224161517/http://www.uvicblc.ca/2012/03/part-1-partnerships-am-i-in-one-and-why-does-it-matter/|archivedate=24 February 2015|date=6 March 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
{{Main|Partnership (Hong Kong)}}
A partnership in Hong Kong is a business entity formed by the Hong Kong Partnerships Ordinance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/38/ |title=Hong Kong Ordinances, CAP 38 Partnership Ordinance |publisher=Hklii.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; which defines a partnership as "the relation between persons carrying on a business in common with a view of profit" and is not a joint stock company or an incorporated company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/38/s3.html |title=Hong Kong Partnerships Ordinance, Chapter 38, section 3 |publisher=Hklii.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the business entity registers with the Registrar of Companies it takes the form of a limited partnership defined in the Limited Partnerships Ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/37/ |title=CAP 37 Limited Partnerships Ordinance |publisher=Hklii.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hklii.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/37/s4.html |title=Hong Kong Limited Partnerships Ordinance, Chapter 37, section 4 |publisher=Hklii.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, if this business entity fails to register with the Registrar of Companies, then it becomes a general partnership as a default.&lt;ref name="hklii.org"/&gt;

===India===
According to section 4 of the Partnership Act of 1932,"Partnership is defined as the relation between two or more persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business run by all or any one of them acting for all". This definition superseded the previous definition given in section 239 of Indian Contract Act 1872 as – “Partnership is the relation which subsists between persons who have agreed to combine their property, labor, skill in some business, and to share the profits thereof between them”. The 1932 definition added the concept of mutual agency. The Indian Partnerships have the following common characteristics:

1) '''A partnership firm is not a legal entity''' apart from the partners constituting it. It has limited identity for the purpose of tax law as per section 4 of the Partnership Act of 1932.&lt;ref name="indiapartact"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Partnership Act, 1932|url=http://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/actsbills/pdf/Partnership_Act_1932.pdf|website=Ministry of Corporate Affairs|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2) '''Partnership is a concurrent subject'''. Contracts of partnerships are included in the Entry no.7 of List III of The Constitution of India (the list constitutes the subjects on which both the State government and Central (National) Government can legislate i.e. pass laws on).&lt;ref name="indiapartact"/&gt;

3) '''Unlimited Liability'''. The major disadvantage of partnership is the unlimited liability of partners for the debts and liabilities of the firm. Any partner can bind the firm and the firm is liable for all liabilities incurred by any firm on behalf of the firm. If property of partnership firm is insufficient to meet liabilities, personal property of any partner can be attached to pay the debts of the firm.&lt;ref name="indiapartact"/&gt;

4) '''Partners are Mutual Agents'''.The business of firm can be carried on by all or any of them for all. Any partner has authority to bind the firm. Act of any one partner is binding on all the partners. Thus, each partner is ‘agent’ of all the remaining partners. Hence, partners are ‘mutual agents’. Section 18 of the Partnership Act, 1932 says "Subject to the provisions of this Act, a partner is the agent of the firm for the purpose of the business of the firm"&lt;ref name="indiapartact"/&gt;

5) '''Oral or Written Agreements'''. The Partnership Act, 1932 nowhere mentions that the Partnership Agreement is to be in written or oral format. Thus the general rule of the [[Indian Contract Act 1872|Contract Act]] applies that the contract can be 'oral' or 'written' as long as it satisfies the basic conditions of being a contract i.e. the agreement between partners is legally enforceable. A written agreement is advisable to establish existence of partnership and to prove rights and liabilities of each partner, as it is difficult to prove an oral agreement.&lt;ref name="indiapartact"/&gt;

6) '''Number of Partners is minimum 2 and maximum 50 in any kind of business activities'''.Since partnership is ‘agreement’ there must be minimum two partners. The Partnership Act does not put any restrictions on maximum number of partners. However, section 464 of Companies Act 2013, and Rule 10 of Companies (Miscellaneous) Rules, 2014 prohibits partnership consisting of more than 50 for any businesses, unless it is '''registered as a company''' under [[Companies Act 2013|Companies Act, 2013]] or formed in pursuance of some other law. Some other law means companies and corporations formed via some other law passed by [[Parliament of India]].

7) '''Mutual agency is the real test'''. The real test of ‘partnership firm’ is ‘mutual agency’ set by the Courts of India, i.e. whether a partner can bind the firm by his act, i.e. whether he can act as agent of all other partners.&lt;ref name="indiapartact"/&gt;

8) '''Global Safety Summit'''. The real test of ‘partnership firm’ is ‘mutual agency’ set by the public limited companies of India, i.e. whether a partner can bind the firm by his act, i.e. whether he can act as agent of all other partners.

===United Kingdom limited partnership===
{{Main|UK partnership law}}

A limited partnership in the United Kingdom consists of:

* One or more people called general partners, who are liable for all debts and obligations of the firm; and
* One or of the firm beyond the amount contributed.

Limited partners may not:

* Draw out or receive back any part of their contributions to the partnership during its lifetime; or
* Take part in the management of the business or have power to bind the firm.

If they do, they become liable for all the debts and obligations of the firm up to the amount drawn out or received back or incurred while taking part in the management, as the case may be.

===United States===
{{Main|Partnership taxation in the United States}}
Under U.S. law a partnership is a business association of two or more individuals, through which partners share the profits and responsibility for the liabilities of their venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partnership|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/partnership|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. states recognize forms of limited partnership that may allow a partner who does not participate in the business venture to avoid liability for the partnership's debts and obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What Is a Partnership|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/partnership.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partnerships typically pay less taxes than corporations in fields like fund management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/84075784-11a2-11e8-8cb6-b9ccc4c4dbbb|title=Private equity chiefs face conversion dilemma|last=Espinoza|first=Javier|last2=Indap|first2=Sujeet|date=2018-02-19|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-15/ares-switches-to-corporation-from-partnership-after-tax-overhaul|title=Ares Becomes Litmus Test for Buyout Firms Mulling Tax Change|date=2018-02-15|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government of the United States does not have specific statutory law governing the establishment of partnerships. Instead, every U.S. state and the District of Columbia has its own statutes and common law that govern partnerships. The [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws]] has issued non-binding model laws (called uniform act) in which to encourage the adoption of uniformity of partnership law into the states by their respective legislatures. Model laws include the [[Uniform Partnership Act]] and the [[Uniform Limited Partnership Act]]. Most U.S. states have adopted a form of the [[Uniform Partnership Act]], which includes provisions reguating  [[general partnership]]s, [[limited partnership]]s and [[limited liability partnership]]s.

Although the federal government does not have specific statutory law for establishing partnerships, it has an extensive statutory and regulatory scheme for the [[Partnership taxation (USA)|taxation of partnerships]], set forth in the [[Internal Revenue Code]] (IRC) and [[Code of Federal Regulations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partnerships|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/partnerships|website=IRS|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The IRC defines federal tax obligations for partnership operations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=26 U.S. Code, Subtite A, Chapter 1, Subchapter K - Partners and Partnerships|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-A/chapter-1/subchapter-K|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that effectively serve as federal regulation of some aspects of partnerships.

A '''reasonable accommodation''' is an adjustment made in a system to accommodate or make fair the same system for an individual based on a proven need. That need can vary.   Accommodations can be religious, physical, mental or emotional, academic, or employment related and are often mandated by law. Each country has its own system of reasonable accommodations. The [[United Nations]] use this term in the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], saying refusal to make accommodation results in [[discrimination]]. It defines a "reasonable accommodation" as:

{{quote|... necessary and appropriate modification and adjustments not imposing a disproportionate or undue burden, where needed in a particular case, to ensure to persons with disabilities the enjoyment or exercise on an equal basis with others of all human rights and fundamental freedoms;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?navid=13&amp;pid=150 |title=Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities |date= |author= |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Canada==

In [[Canada]] [[equality rights]], as set out in provincial and [[Canadian Human Rights Act|federal anti-discrimination laws]] and in [[section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 15]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], require that accommodation be made to various minorities. (The origin of the term ''reasonable accommodation'' in Canadian law is found in its labour law jurisprudence, specifically ''[[Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v Simpsons-Sears Ltd]]'', [1985] 2 SCR 536, and is argued to be the obligation of employers to change some general rules for certain employees, under the condition that this does not cause "[[undue hardship]]".)

===Quebec===
In Quebec, under the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] and the provincial charter of human rights, politicians engaged in "values" clarifications on accommodation from at least 2007. In that time, various ideologies attempted to impose onto Quebecers definitions of values, without consensus or even legislative success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montrealgazette.com/opinion/columnists/dan-delmar-why-quebec-values-remain-undefined-after-a-decade-of-debate|title=Dan Delmar: Why Quebec Values Remain Undefined After a Decade of Debate|date=22 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question on what was and will be the national identity has been contested, such as the court decision on the wearing of the Sikh [[kirpan]] in ''[[Multani v. Commission scolaire Marguerite‑Bourgeoys]].''

The municipal council of the town of [[Hérouxville, Quebec|Hérouxville]] passed a "[[Hérouxville Standards|code of conduct]]" for residents. It provided details of expectations of behaviour, and defined practices of other countries that were not acceptable in the town, such as stoning women or [[death by burning|burning them alive]], and [[female genital mutilation]]. The code of conduct also explained common practices in Canadian culture. It said that carrying a weapon to school (a reference to the [[Sikh]] ceremonial [[kirpan]]), covering one's face (some particular forms of the Muslim [[veil]]), and making accommodation for prayer in public schools would not be permitted. It attests that "Our people eat to nourish the body, not the soul," in reference to [[Kashrut|Jewish]] and [[Halal|Muslim dietary laws]], and that health-care professionals "do not have to ask permission to perform blood transfusions."

This code of conduct was developed as the town and province absorbed more immigrants from other cultures. Other cultural questions arose. In 2007 a [[YMCA]] set up [[clouded windows]] to shield ultra-Orthodox Jews who had complained that youngsters could see girls and women in gym attire. There have been questions about whether voters are allowed to fill out and submit ballots while clothed in a [[niqab]] or [[burqa|burka]], which can hide identity. A Muslim spokesman said that women are always required to show identity for public purposes, so it was a question raised unnecessarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=CTV.ca|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070911/{{Not a typo|accom|odation}}_quebec_070911/20070911?hub=Canada|title=Immigrants Source of Enrichment to Quebec: Group|date=11 September 2007|accessdate=4 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most residents in Quebec have identified as Catholic on surveys, the province has become increasingly secular, with declining rates of church attendance. The provincial government has worked to reach an accommodation with the Roman Catholic Church on guidelines for conversion or disposal of underused churches.  The church has allowed local parishes to work with municipalities to develop the buildings as community centres, for example, rather than for private condominium construction.

====Judaism====
In 2007, Benjamin Rubin, a forward with the [[Gatineau Olympiques]] [[ice hockey]] team, refused to play several key matches because they fell on a [[Jewish holiday]].  Some claimed the [[Jews]] would end up forcing the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] to reschedule all their matches on Fridays and Saturdays. Rubin and the Olympiques came to an agreement, and "he will only miss a handful of games." He has since left the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2007/09/12/ot-rubin-070912.html |title=Quebec Jewish hockey Player Agrees to Play on Sabbath |date=12 September 2007 |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20070924_109270_109270&amp;source=srch |title=Not Particularly Accommodating |date=24 September 2007 |author=Patriquin, Martin |work=Maclean's |accessdate=14 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207163139/http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20070924_109270_109270&amp;source=srch |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
In 2007 [[Elections Canada]] ruled that Muslim women wearing the [[niqab]] (veil) or [[Burqa|burka]] would be allowed to vote in all upcoming national elections, by-elections and referendums without showing their faces to an Elections Canada official.&lt;ref name="veil"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=a3170edf-a111-443d-b2fe-2b2361274eb2&amp;k=52399|title=Canadians with Faces Veiled Can Vote|date=8 September 2007|work=[[National Post]]|last=Offman|first=Craig|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910124149/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=a3170edf-a111-443d-b2fe-2b2361274eb2&amp;k=52399|archivedate=10 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same policy applies to all Canadians under federal Bill C-31, in that photo identification is not strictly required if two other pieces of acceptable official identification are provided, or another voter vouches for them. The proclamation created social animosity towards Muslims in Quebec.&lt;ref name="veil"/&gt; Premier [[Jean Charest]] of Quebec described this as a bad decision. He noted that Quebec's [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] had voted to forbid Muslim women from voting if they would not reveal their faces as a confirmation of identity.&lt;ref name="veil"/&gt;

The national [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government challenged Elections Canada to review this decision. The federal [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] and the [[Bloc Québécois]] also requested such a reversal, to demand that all voters be required to show their faces in order to vote, even those whose faces are normally covered for religious reasons. They joined other federal and provincial politicians from Quebec who attacked the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/politics/story.html?id=4a1a8fe7-60f0-4dff-9f05-9686c31cbb2e |title=No Veils at the Polls, Feds Urge |date=8 September 2007 |location=Montreal |work=The Gazette |accessdate=14 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102181239/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/politics/story.html?id=4a1a8fe7-60f0-4dff-9f05-9686c31cbb2e |archivedate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Elgazzar, an advocate for the [[Canadian Council on American–Islamic Relations]] in Montreal, declared that it is improbable that very many Muslim women will have hidden faces when voting. Elgazzar insisted that women using niqabs usually take them off to distinguish themselves and do not sport them for photo identification. This fact was echoed by Salam Elmenyawi of the Muslim Council of Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/columnists/story.html?id=e3bb831c-31fd-4988-a486-190b5d472ba1 |title=Hey, Here's an Idea: Let's Ask Muslims What They Think |date=8 September 2007 |location=Montreal |work=The Gazette |accessdate=14 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102174601/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/columnists/story.html?id=e3bb831c-31fd-4988-a486-190b5d472ba1 |archivedate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Media exposure====

There was extensive coverage of related issues in Quebec's news media in 2006 and 2007. Some analysts attributed this more to competition among media than a measure of citizen concern. The [[premier of Quebec]] declared several non-negotiable values, such as "the equality of women and men; the primacy of French; the separation between the state and religion".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The conservative political party [[Action démocratique du Québec]] (ADQ) appeared to gain support from these debates. It formed the official opposition in the provincial legislature for one term from 2007 to 2008, until the increasing prominence of the global economic crisis relegated reasonable accommodation to an issue of less importance.&lt;ref name=debatebegin&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=ec4ec029-c021-4571-a25e-fa73850b3857&amp;k=99148|publisher=The Gazette (Montreal)|title=Let the Debate Begin|last=Carroll|first=Ann|date=15 August 2007|accessdate=14 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026051327/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=ec4ec029-c021-4571-a25e-fa73850b3857&amp;k=99148|archivedate=26 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Employment integration====

A 2006 examination from [[Statistics Canada]] demonstrated that Quebec had the highest newcomer unemployment rate in Canada.&lt;ref name="Bryan2007"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bryan|first1=Jay|title=Wanted: Reasonable Accommodation in the Job Market|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/montreal-gazette/20070911/281590941183811|accessdate=4 May 2017|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=11 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The newest immigrants endured an unemployment ratio of 17.8 per cent in 2006, or almost three times the 6.3 per cent ratio of native-born help.  In contrast, joblessness among current newcomers in Ontario was 11 per cent contrasted with 4.4 per cent among the Canadian born. In British Columbia, the numbers were 9.5 per cent and 3.7 per cent, respectively.&lt;ref name="Bryan2007"/&gt;

The study's coauthor, Danielle Zietsma, was reported to have cautioned that she and her colleagues would need some time to conduct the analyses necessary to explain the basis of these findings. The ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' columnist Jay Bryan suggested that Quebec was exceptional in the degree to which it imposed hurdles on new immigrants seeking employment in the province, including "the devaluation of allegedly inadequate foreign credentials, language tests that have little to do with professional performance, and 'Canadian experience' requirements that serve as an all-purpose excuse to lock out job applicants who don't already have a job."&lt;ref name="Bryan2007"/&gt; However, the column reported that the study had found similar numbers of surveyed immigrants had indicated that the demand for Canadian experience (26 per cent) or foreign credentialing and work experience recognition problems (21 per cent) as principal barriers to employment.&lt;ref name="Bryan2007"/&gt;

====Political reaction====

Former leader of the [[Parti Québécois]] [[André Boisclair]] noted, "We're not talking about reasonable accommodation [if] it has nothing to do with public services", Boisclair said. At the same time, Boisclair blamed Premier [[Jean Charest]] for pandering to Quebecers who balk at adjustments made for immigrants in civil society. Charest declined to defend them when girls wearing [[hijab]] were prohibited from soccer and tae kwon do, and when prejudiced remarks were offered about Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/columnists/article/256056 |title=One Law for One and All, Consistently Applied |date=13 September 2007 |author=Haroon Siddiqui |work=The Star |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mario Dumont]], leader of the [[Action démocratique du Québec]] (ADQ) said in an interview in ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' that Quebec needs more immigration for economic and demographic reasons, but that he believes that Quebec had met its limits of immigrant acculturation, and that any further increase in rates of immigration would create [[ghettos]]. (At present, the province accepts a smaller percentage of newcomers than elsewhere in Canada.)
He criticized Charest for a plan to raise such levels when the Liberal government has cut funds for integration of newcomers into French culture. "We're a linguistic minority...and immigrants need francization", Dumont said. "It's quite a challenge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/quebec-to-reconsider-integration-of-immigrants-1.252497 |title=Quebec to Reconsider Integration of Immigrants |date=14 August 2007 |author= |publisher=Canadian Press |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then Parti Québécois leader [[Pauline Marois]] said that Quebec should assume all control over its immigration, not the 60 per cent that it has now under a bilateral agreement with the government of Canada. She also said the province should make the message clear to immigrants that Quebec is a francophone "state", not officially bilingual as are the federal government and Quebec's neighbouring province [[New Brunswick]].

Marois said that Quebec is in need of more immigrants, to offset a low birth rate for future labour needs. She further believes that Quebec is a francophone state in which the rights of the [[English-speaking Quebecker|anglophone minority]] are respected, and where all the inhabitants live in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=2c1f14fb-f55f-45a9-abee-4167c3b702c6&amp;k=58090 |title=Let Quebec Control Its Immigration, Marois Says |date=15 August 2007 |author= |work=National Post |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charest criticized his political adversaries in the provincial legislature, and blamed them for encouraging "intolerance" in the continuing controversy. He published an open letter in regional dailies, saying he is worried the province's image of openness will diminish outside Quebec.

Dumont's statements about immigration, he said, led to the passing of a code of conduct by the town of [[Hérouxville]] that notified Muslims that face veils or stoning women would not be accepted there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20071030/charest_lashesout_071030/20071030?hub=Canada |title=Charest Lashes Out on Reasonable Accommodation |date=30 October 2007 |author= |publisher=The Canadian Press |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bouchard–Taylor Commission====
Premier [[Jean Charest]], citing several instances of "unreasonable" accommodation, [[advice (constitutional)|advised]] the [[Lieutenant Governor of Quebec]] to appoint a two-man commission in February 2007, to investigate the issue of reasonable accommodation, and report back by 31 March 2008. The formal title for the commission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/article/266436 |title=Canadian Reality Is Multicultural |date=15 October 2007 |author= |work=The Star |accessdate=14 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the ''Consultation Commission on Accommodation Practices Related to Cultural Differences'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=dd9de1f7-279d-4ca1-9c8d-e3f176f8501d |title=Quebecers Could Use a Primer on the History of Immigration |date=22 August 2007 |author= |location=Montreal |work=The Gazette |accessdate=14 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026055500/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=dd9de1f7-279d-4ca1-9c8d-e3f176f8501d |archivedate=26 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is sometimes called the ''Bouchard–Taylor Commission''.  Its commissioners are professors [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], a well-known federalist and philosopher, and [[Gérard Bouchard]], a historian and sociologist. Bouchard said in an interview that ''sovereignty'' was the solution to calm Franco-Quebecers' cultural insecurity. Co-chair Taylor stated, however, that Quebecers need to demonstrate the "openness and generosity of spirit" that majorities should have towards minorities.&lt;ref name=debatebegin /&gt;

The commission conducted hearings in various Quebec regions. The committee listened to individuals, organizations, and so-called experts on Quebec identity, religion, and integration of cultural communities ([[minority groups]]). Before formal proceedings began, Bouchard and Taylor said they heard in focus groups across the province that there was insecurity among Quebec's traditional ethnic French population. They believed that hearings would help with educating the public; for instance, they thought the perception of Muslim influence was higher among some groups than is justified by data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=4e87dde2-987c-4872-9cb9-d0f430ec8ccd |title=Bouchard and Taylor Will Have to Speak, Too |date=22 August 2007 |location=Montreal |work=The Gazette |accessdate=14 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026062803/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/editorial/story.html?id=4e87dde2-987c-4872-9cb9-d0f430ec8ccd |archivedate=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor underlined that Quebecers need to show an "openness and generosity of spirit" for 'cultural communities. As well, the report recommended that accommodation be made in public schools to allow students who want to wear religious attire in class, such as the hijab, kippah or turban, to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/stephen-harper-dumb-to-say-niqab-is-anti-women-charles-taylor-says-1.3013427|title=Former Quebec Commission Chair Calls Harper's Niqab Line 'Dumb'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bouchard–Taylor report recommended that judges, Crown prosecutors, prison guards and police officers refrain from wearing any religious attire or symbols. "We believe that a majority of Quebecers accept that a uniform prohibition applying to all government employees regardless of the nature of their position is excessive, but want those employees who occupy positions that embody at the highest level the necessary neutrality of the state&amp;nbsp;... to impose on themselves a form of circumspection concerning the expression of their religious convictions", Bouchard and Taylor wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/chris-selley-charles-taylor-niqab-defender|title=Chris Selley: Charles Taylor ... Niqab Defender?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission also recommended that the crucifix in the National Assembly, placed above the Speaker's chair by Premier [[Maurice Duplessis]], be removed to another part of the building. This is a recommendation that successive governments have rejected.&lt;ref&gt;https://montrealgazette.com/news/quebec/dangerous-appalling-divisive-destructive-charles-taylor-on-the-caqs-religious-symbols-plan&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, In the aftermath of the [[Charter of Quebecois Values]] debate, Taylor stated that he no longer supports that opinion, and said it was misinterpreted by many politicians. The Bouchard–Taylor report deliberately did not include teachers, civil servants and health-care professionals from those that should be forbidden to wear religious symbols.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-legault-gets-ahead-of-himself-on-the-notwithstanding-clause/&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

In the United States, federal law requires that reasonable accommodations be made for employment, education, housing, courts, and public venues.

===Employment===
The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans With Disabilities Act]], known as ADA, was signed into law on 26 July 1990. It carried forward material from Section 504 of the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]]. 'A reasonable accommodation' is defined by the US Department of Justice as "any modification or adjustment to a job or the work environment that will enable a qualified applicant or employee with a disability to participate in the application process or to perform essential job functions. Reasonable accommodation also includes adjustments to assure that a qualified individual with a disability has [[employment equity|rights and privileges in employment]] equal to those of employees without disabilities."{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In September 2012, [[Home Depot]] company agreed to pay $100,000 and furnish other relief to settle a [[disability]] discrimination lawsuit filed by the US [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], for the alleged failure to provide a reasonable accommodation for a cashier with cancer at its [[Towson, Maryland]], store, and then for purportedly firing her because of her condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home Depot to Pay $100,000 to Settle EEOC Disability Discrimination Suit
|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/home-depot-to-pay-100000-to-settle-eeoc-disability-discrimination-suit |publisher=US [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] |work=The National Law Review|date=10 September 2012|accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State and local government services, programs, and activities===
Title II of the ADA provides that "no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subject to discrimination by any such entity".&lt;ref&gt;Civil Rights. (2012). US Department of Health &amp; Human Services. Retrieved 28 January 2014 from https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; State and local governments must provide reasonable accommodations to ensure such access, unless a fundamental alteration would result.

===Public accommodations===
Title III of the ADA requires private businesses open to the public and commercial facilities to provide reasonable accommodations to people with disabilities to ensure that they have equal access to goods and services.

===Housing===
Under Title VIII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, codified in the United States Code at 42 USC §§ 3601–3619, and commonly known as the Fair Housing Act, virtually all housing providers must make reasonable accommodations in their rules, policies, practices, or services under certain circumstances.  A reasonable accommodation must be granted when such an accommodation is necessary to afford a prospective or existing tenant with a disability an [[right to housing|opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling]] (including but not limited to apartments, single family homes, and other types of private and public housing) to the same extent as a person who does not have that disability.  The Fair Housing Act covers "dwellings", and in many situations that term encompasses such non-traditional housing as homeless shelters and college dormitories. It bears noting that in regard to larger dwellings such as apartment buildings, the right to a reasonable accommodation under the Fair Housing Act requires that housing providers grant a requested reasonable accommodation that is necessary to enable a disabled tenant to enjoy an indoor or outdoor common area to the same extent as a non-disabled tenant enjoys such areas.

In regard to reasonable accommodations, there is no requirement that a housing provider initiate the reasonable accommodation process; the Fair Housing Act contemplates that a tenant will approach his or her landlord with a request for a change in the landlord's policies that will reasonably accommodate the tenant's disability.  For example, a prospective or actual tenant whose disability requires him to use crutches may request a reasonable accommodation in the form of an assigned parking space close to the entrance of his or her apartment building.  If the disability is of a kind covered by the Fair Housing Act, and there is a genuine relationship between the requested accommodation and the disability, and granting the reasonable accommodation would not fundamentally alter the nature of the landlord's operations or impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the landlord, then the landlord must grant the requested reasonable accommodation or else find himself in violation of the Fair Housing Act and liable for substantial civil money penalties as well as payment to the disabled person for the injury suffered by him or her.

The Fair Housing Act is enforced by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), whose regulations governing reasonable accommodations are found at 24 CFR § 100.204.  Sometimes it is easy to tell when (for example) a tenant has a disability and the tenant's reasonable accommodation request must be granted; other times it is not quite so apparent that a tenant suffers from a recognized disability.  But a housing provider has an obligation to engage in an interactive process in order to honestly try to figure out whether the requested accommodation is reasonable and must be granted.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development and the US Department of Justice have issued a joint statement to provide guidance on the concept of reasonable accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hud.gov/offices/fheo/library/huddojstatement.pdf | title=Joint Statement of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Justice&amp;nbsp;– Reasonable Accommodations Under the Fair Housing Act | date=17 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (including the amendments made by the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008), overlaps with the Fair Housing Act in its coverage of [[public housing]].  As noted on HUD's website: "Public housing was established to provide decent and safe rental housing for eligible low-income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/ph|title=Public Housing |publisher=HUD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a million US households live in public housing.

==United Kingdom==

The laws of England, Wales, and Scotland require employers to make reasonable accommodations for disabled employees, initially under the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]], and now under the [[Equality Act 2010]]. Failure to do so can give rise to a complaint by an employee to an [[employment tribunal]].

{{Liberalism sidebar|Variants}}
{{Social democracy sidebar |expanded=variants}}
The '''Reformist Left''' is a political term coined by [[Richard Rorty]] in his 1998 book ''[[Achieving Our Country]]'', in reference to the mainstream Left in the United States (though the term may be applied elsewhere) in the first two thirds of the 20th century:
{{quote|I propose to use the term "reformist Left" to cover all those Americans who, between 1900 and 1964, struggled within the framework of constitutional democracy to protect the weak from the strong.&amp;nbsp;... I think that the Left should get back into the business of piecemeal reform within the framework of a market economy. This was the business the American Left was in during the first two-thirds of the century.&amp;nbsp;... Emphasizing the continuity between [[Herbert Croly]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]], between [[John Dewey]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]], between [[Eugene V. Debs|Eugene Debs]] and [[Walter Reuther]], would help us to recall a reformist Left which deserves not only respect but imitation—the best model available for the American Left in the coming century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;}}

== Definition ==
[[Richard Rorty]]'s purpose in defining the Reformist Left is breaking away from the prevailing notion of the Left being divided between [[New Left|New]] and [[Old Left]], which left no room for anyone but [[Marxism|Marxists]] and [[Neo-Marxism|Neo-Marxists]]:
{{quote|For us Americans, it is important not to let Marxism influence the story we tell about our own Left. We should repudiate the Marxists, insinuation that only those who are convinced capitalism must be overthrown can count as leftists, and that everybody else is a wimpy liberal, a self-deceiving bourgeois reformer. Many recent histories of the Sixties have, unfortunately, been influenced by Marxism. These histories distinguish the emergent student Left and the so-called Old Left from the "liberals"—a term used to cover both the people who administered the New Deal and those whom Kennedy brought from Harvard to the White House in 1961. In such histories, you are counted as a member of the Old Left only if you had proclaimed yourself a socialist early on, and if you continued to express grave doubts about the viability of capitalism. So, in the historiography which has unfortunately become standard, [[Irving Howe]] and [[Michael Harrington]] count as leftists, but [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] and [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.|Arthur Schlesinger]] do not, even though these four men promoted mostly the same causes and thought about our country's problems in pretty much the same terms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;}}

Rorty thus includes in the Reformist Left all that have, at one time or another, advanced reforms—not revolutions—toward social justice:...
{{quote|In my sense of the term, [[Woodrow Wilson]]—the president who kept [[Eugene V. Debs|Eugene Debs]] jail but appointed [[Louis Brandeis|Louis Bradeis]] to the Supreme Court—counts as a part-time leftist. So does &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;—the president who created the rudiments of a welfare state and urged workers to join labor unions, while obdurately turning his back on African-Americans. So does [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]], who permitted the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese children, but also did more for poor children in the United States than any previous president.&amp;nbsp;... A hundred years from now, [[Irving Howe|Howe]] and [[John Kenneth Galbraith|Galbraith]], [[Michael Harrington|Harrington]] and [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.|Schlesinger]], [[Edmund Wilson|Wilson]] and Debs, [[Jane Addams]] and [[Angela Davis]], [[Felix Frankfurter]] and [[John L. Lewis]], [[W.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;B. Du Bois]] and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Robert Reich]] and [[Jesse Jackson]], will all be remembered for having advanced the cause of social justice. They will all be seen as having been "on the Left." The difference between these people and men like [[Calvin Coolidge]], [[Irving Babbitt]], [[T.&amp;nbsp;S. Eliot]], [[Robert Taft Jr.|Robert Taft]], and [[William F.

{{quote|When one of today's academic leftists says that some topic has been "inadequately theorized," you can be pretty certain that he or she is going to drag in either philosophy of language, or [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] psychoanalysis, or some [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxist]] version of economic determinism. Theorists of the Left think that dissolving political agents into plays of differential subjectivity, or political initiatives into pursuits of [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]'s impossible object of desire, helps to subvert the established order. Such subversion, they say, is accomplished by "problematizing familiar concepts."&amp;nbsp;... With this partial substitution of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] for [[Karl Marx|Marx]] as a source of social theory, sadism rather than selfishness has become the principal target of the Left. The heirs of the New Left of the Sixties have created, within the academy, a [[cultural Left]]. Many members of this Left specialize in what they call the "politics of difference" or "of identity" or "of recognition."&amp;nbsp;... The new cultural Left which has resulted from these changes has few ties to what remains of the pre-Sixties reformist Left.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;}}

== History ==
[[File:Williams James.jpg|alt=William James (1842–1910)|thumb|upright|[[William James]] (1842–1910) is the grandfather of [[pragmatism]] and of the Reformist Left.]]

=== United States ===
[[File:John Dewey cph.3a51565.jpg|alt=John Dewey (1859–1952)|thumb|upright|[[John Dewey]] (1859–1952) was an heir to James' [[pragmatism]] and to his Reformist Leftist tradition.]]

==== Birth ====
Rorty traces the origins of the Reformist Left in the United States back to [[William James]] and [[Herbert Croly]], in their [[pragmatism]], [[egalitarianism]] and faith in democracy:
{{quote|"Democracy," James wrote, "is a kind of religion, and we are bound not to admit its failure. Faiths and utopias are the noblest exercise of human reason, and no one with a spark of reason in him will sit down fatalistically before the croaker's picture."&amp;nbsp;... Croly wrote that "a more highly socialized democracy is the only practicable substitute on the part of convinced democrats for an excessively individualized democracy." It is time, he believed, to set about developing what he called "a dominant and constructive national purpose." In becoming "responsible for the subordination of the individual to that purpose," he said, "the American state will in effect be making itself responsible for a morally and socially desirable distribution of wealth." From 1909 until the present, the thesis that the state must make itself responsible for such redistribution has marked the dividing line between the American Left and the American Right.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;}}

Inspired by James and Croly, [[Walt Whitman]] and [[John Dewey]], further fleshed out their call into a vision:
{{quote|This new, quasi-communitarian rhetoric was at the heart of the [[Progressivism|Progressive Movement]] and the [[New Deal]]. It set the tone for the American Left during the first six decades of the twentieth century. [[Walt Whitman]] and [[John Dewey]], as we shall see, did a great deal to shape this rhetoric.&amp;nbsp;... They offered a new account of what America was, in the hope of mobilizing Americans as political agents. The most striking feature of their redescription of our country is its thoroughgoing secularism.&amp;nbsp;... "Democracy," Dewey said, "is neither a form of government nor a social expediency, but a metaphysic of the relation of man and his experience in nature." For both Whitman and Dewey, the terms "America" and "democracy" are shorthand for a new conception of what it is to be human—a conception which has no room for obedience to a nonhuman authority, and in which nothing save freely achieved consensus among human beings has any authority at all.}}

And that [[secularism]] in Whitman and Dewey, Rorty attributes to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s [[humanism]]:
{{quote|Forgetting about eternity, and replacing knowledge of the antecedently real with hope for the contingent future, is not easy. But both tasks have been a good deal easier since Hegel. Hegel was the first philosopher to take time and finitude as seriously as any [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]] materialist, while at the same time taking the religious impulse as seriously as any Hebrew prophet or Christian saint.&amp;nbsp;... He suggested that the meaning of human life is a function of how human history turns out, rather than of the relation of that history to something ahistorical. This suggestion made it easier for two of Hegel's readers, Dewey and Whitman, to claim that the way to think about the significance of the human adventure is to look forward rather than upward: to contrast a possible human future with the human past and present.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;}}

==== Rise ====
[[File:Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1933.jpg|alt=Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882-1945)|thumb|upright|Many of [[John Dewey|Dewey]]'s ideas came into their own in the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR's]]'s [[New Deal]], and its administration employed many that subscribed to them.]]
Dewey, in turn, inspired many of the reformers that followed him:
{{quote|Dewey disliked and distrusted [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], but many of his ideas came into their own in the [[New Deal]].&amp;nbsp;... Because a lot of my relatives helped write and administer [[New Deal]] legislation, I associated leftism with a constant need for new laws and new bureaucratic initiatives which would redistribute the wealth produced by the capitalist system. I spent occasional vacations in Madison with [[Paul Raushenbush]], who ran Wisconsin's unemployment compensation system, and his wife, Elizabeth Brandeis (a professor of labor history, and the author of the first exposé of the misery of migrant workers on Wisconsin farms). Both were students of [[John R. Commons]], who had passed on the heritage of his own teacher, [[Richard Ely Bird|Richard Ely]]. Their friends included Max Otto, a disciple of Dewey. Otto was the in-house philosopher for a group of Madison bureaucrats and academics clustered around the [[La Follette family]]. In that circle, American patriotism, redistributionist economics, anti-communism, and Deweyan pragmatism went together easily and naturally. I think of that circle as typical of the reformist American Left of the first half of the century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;}}

==== Eclipse ====
[[File:Todd Gitlin by David Shankbone crop.jpg|alt=Todd Gitlin (born 1943)|thumb|upright|[[Todd Gitlin]] (born 1943), an American sociologist, diagnosed the eclipse of the Reformist Left starting in 1964.]]
Rorty concurs with [[Todd Gitlin]] that the hegemony of reformism within the Left in the Unites States came to halt in 1964: 
{{quote|The conviction that the vast inequalities within American society could be corrected by using the institutions of a constitutional democracy—that a cooperative commonwealth could be created by electing the right politicians and passing the right laws—held the non-Marxist American Left together from Croly's time until the early 1960s. But the [[Vietnam War]] splintered that Left. Todd Gitlin believes August 1964 marks the break in the leftist students' sense of what their country was like. That was the month in which the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] was denied seats at the [[Democratic National Convention|Democratic Convention]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], and in which Congress passed the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution|Tonkin Gulf Resolution]].}}
{{quote|Gitlin argues plausibly that these two events "fatefully turned the movement" and "drew a sharp line through the [[New Left]]'s Sixties." Before them, most of the New Left's rhetoric was consensual and reformist. After them, it began to build up to the full-throated calls for revolution with which the decade ended. Whether or not one agrees with Gitlin about the exact date, it is certainly the case that the mid-Sixties saw the beginning of the end of a tradition of leftist reformism which dated back to the [[Progressive Era]].&amp;nbsp;...}}
{{quote|The New Leftists gradually became convinced that the [[Vietnam War]] and the endless humiliation inflicted on African-Americans were clues to something deeply wrong with their country, and not just mistakes correctable by reforms. They wanted to hear that America was a very different sort of place, a much worse place, than their parents and teachers had told them it was. So they responded enthusiastically to [[Christopher Lasch|Lasch]]'s claim that "the structure of American society makes it almost impossible for criticism of existing policies to become part of political discourse. The language of American politics increasingly resembles an [[Orwellian]] monologue."}}
{{quote|When they read in Lasch's book that "the United States of the mid-twentieth century might better be described as an empire than as a community," the students felt justified in giving up their parents' hope that reformist politics could cope with the injustice they saw around them. Lasch's book made it easy to stop thinking of oneself as a member of a community, as a citizen with civic responsibilities. For if you turn out to be living in an evil empire (rather than, as you had been told, a democracy fighting an evil empire), then you have no responsibility to your country; you are accountable only to humanity. If what your government and your teachers are saying is all part of the same [[Orwellian]] monologue, if the differences between the Harvard faculty and the military-industrial complex, or between [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] and [[Barry Goldwater]], are negligible, then you have a responsibility to make a revolution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;}}

==== Trump's election ====

{{quote|At that point, something will crack. The nonsuburban electorate will decide that the system has failed and start looking around for a strongman to vote for—someone willing to assure them that once he is elected, the smug bureaucrats, tricky lawyers, overpaid bond salesmen, and postmodernist professors will no longer be calling the shots. A scenario like that of [[Sinclair Lewis]]' novel ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'' may then be played out. For once such a strongman takes of office, nobody can predict what will happen. In 1932, most of the predictions made about what would happen if Hindenburg named Hitler chancellor were wildly overoptimistic.}}
{{quote|One thing that is very likely to happen is that the gains made in the past forty years by black and brown Americans and by homosexuals will be wiped out. Jocular contempt for women will come back into fashion. The words "nigger" and "kike" will once again be heard in the workplace. All the sadism which the academic Left has tried to make unacceptable to its students will come flooding back. All the resentment which badly educated Americans feel about having their manners dictated to them by college graduates will find an outlet.}}
{{quote|But such a renewal of sadism will not alter the effects of selfishness. For after my imagined strongman takes charge, he will quickly make his peace with the international super rich, just as Hitler made his with the German industrialists. He will invoke the glorious memory of the Gulf War to provoke military adventures which will generate short-term prosperity. He will be a disaster for the country and the world. People will wonder why there was so little resistance to his inevitable rise. Where, they will ask, was the American Left? Why was it only rightists like [[Pat Buchanan|[Pat] Buchanan]] who spoke to the workers about the consequences of [[globalization]]? Why could not the Left channel the mounting rage of the newly dispossessed?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;}}

==== Revival ====
Rorty's book, more than simply a historical and philosophical account of the Reformist Left, is itself a manifesto toward its revival:
{{quote|I think that the Left should get back into the business of piecemeal reform within the framework of a market economy. This was the business the American Left was in during the first two-thirds of the century.&amp;nbsp;... I can sum up by saying that it would be a good thing if the next generation of American leftists found as little resonance in the names of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]] as in those of [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Benito Mussolini]]. It would be an even better thing if the names of Ely and Croly, [[Theodore Dreiser|Dreiser]] and Debs, [[A. Philip Randolph]] and [[John L. Lewis]] were more familiar to these leftists than they were to the students of the Sixties.&amp;nbsp;... Emphasizing the continuity between Herbert Croly and Lyndon Johnson, between [[John Dewey]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]], between Eugene Debs and [[Walter Reuther]], would help us to recall a reformist Left which deserves not only respect but imitation—the best model available for the American Left in the coming century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;}}

== Outside the United States ==
While Rorty focuses his definition of the Reformist Left in the realm of the American Left, his characterization sits in a much larger narrative, extending far beyond the confines of the United States:

'''START III''' ('''Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty''') was a proposed bi-lateral [[nuclear disarmament]] treaty between the [[United States]] and the [[Russian Federation]].  It meant to drastically reduce the deployed [[nuclear weapon]]s arsenals of both countries and to continue the weapons reduction efforts that had taken place in the [[START I]] and [[START II]] negotiations. The framework for negotiations of the treaty began with talks in [[Helsinki]] between President [[Bill Clinton]] and President [[Boris Yeltsin]] in 1997.  However, negotiations broke down and the treaty was never signed.

Proposed basic elements of the treaty included:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Arms Control Association, [http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/start3 The START III Framework at a Glance], 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
* By December 31, 2007, coterminous with START II, the United States and the Russian Federation would each deploy no more than 2,000 to 2,500 strategic nuclear warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers. Russian officials stated that they were willing to consider negotiated levels as low as 1,500 strategic nuclear warheads within the context of a START III agreement&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.
* The United States and Russia would negotiate measures relating to the transparency of strategic nuclear warhead inventories and the destruction of strategic nuclear warheads, as well as other jointly agreed technical and organizational measures to promote the irreversibility of deep reductions. 

The talks faced a number of obstacles.  The refusal of the Russian Duma to ratify the START II treaty delayed the start of formal negotiations by more than two years after Yeltsin and Clinton completed the initial framework discussions in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1999/06/22/clinton-yeltsin-plan-new-talks-on-nuclear-arms/0afa6381-cac8-430e-97ae-59757c6bb248/|title=Clinton, Yeltsin Plan New Talks On Nuclear Arms|last=Hoffman|first=David|date=1999-06-22|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Very little progress was made towards completing negotiations on START III. Attempts at negotiating START III were eventually abandoned and the US and Russia instead agreed to the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (SORT) or Moscow Treaty&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

==In popular culture==
START III plays a large role in the 1998 video game, ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]''. In the game a nuclear terrorist attack is scheduled on the date of the signing of START III which is supposed to take place at the end of February 2005.

'''Safety Provisions (Building) Convention, 1937''' is  an [[International Labour Organization]] [[International Labour Organization#International Labour Conference|Convention]].

It was established in 1937:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Considering that building work gives rise to serious accident risks which it is necessary to reduce both on humanitarian and on economic grounds, and&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Having decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to safety provisions for workers in the building industry with reference to scaffolding and hoisting machinery,...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Ratifications and denunciations==
*As of 2013, the convention had been ratified by 30 states. However, nine of the ratifying states have automatically denounced the treaty because of subsequent ratification of conventions that automatically trigger denunciation of the 1937 treaty.

'''Scot and lot''' is a phrase common in the records of [[England|English]] medieval [[borough]]s, referring to local rights and obligations.

The term ''scot'' comes from the [[Old English]] word ''sceat'', meaning a [[sceat]], an ordinary coin in [[Anglo-Saxon]] times, equivalent to the later [[penny]]. In Anglo-Saxon times, a payment was levied locally to cover the cost of establishing drainage, and embankments, of low-lying land, and observing them to ensure they remain secure. This payment was typically a sceat, so the levy itself gradually became to be called ''sceat''. In [[burgh]]s, ''sceat'' was levied to cover maintenance of the town walls and defences.

In Norman times, under the influence of the word ''escot'', in [[Old French]], the vowel changed, and the term became ''scot''. In 19th century [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]], low-lying farmland was still being called scot-land. ''Scot'', though, gradually became a general term for local levies; a person who was not liable for the levy, but received its benefits, ''got off '[[wiktionary:scot-free|scot-free]]'.''

''Lot'' means ''portion''/''share'', hence ''[[lottery]]'', and ''[[allotment (finance)|allotment]]''. The phrase ''scot and lot'' thus meant the local levies someone paid, and the share they received of local provisions; more generally, it meant ''rights and obligations'', in respect of local government.

[[Parliament]] had evolved from the king's [[court baron|baronial court]], with the [[House of Commons|commons]] being populated by representatives of the landholders who were too minor to call in person. Burghs were somewhat outside the [[feudalism|feudal system]], making their [[Suffrage|franchise]] ambiguous. Before the mid 19th century, burghs varied in their choice of franchise. In some burghs, the franchise was set at ''scot and lot''; that is, people were only permitted to vote if they were liable for the local levies. 

In mediaeval times, this could mean dozens of people, and by the 19th century tens of thousands of people could qualify in a single ''scot and lot'' burgh. In [[Gatton (UK Parliament constituency)|Gatten]], however, only two people qualified under ''scot and lot''; since burghs received 2 MPs, this meant that each MP for Gatten represented exactly 1 voter. [[Rotten Borough|The quirks]] of the existing system, such as Gatton, was one of the reasons for the [[Reform Act 1832|1832 Great Reform Act]].

A [[cognate]] term, ''skat'', exists in the [[udal law]] of [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5187">'''Section 839(a) of title 10 United States Code § 925 - Article 125.''' is a punitive article of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]].

==History==

On June 4, 1920, the [[United States Congress]] approved a modified [[Articles of War]]. Article 93 was changed to make the act of sodomy a crime in itself, separate from the offense of assault with intent to commit sodomy. The law went into effect on February 4, 1921. From February 4, 1921 to December 26, 2013, [[sodomy]] was prohibited in the [[United States military]]. Those found guilty of violating it were punished as a court-martial may direct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usni.org/news-and-features/dont-ask-dont-tell/timeline Key Dates in US Policy on Gay Men and Women in the United States Military]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/AW/index.html The Articles of War]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 5, 1950, the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice|UCMJ]] was passed  by Congress and was signed into law by President [[Harry S. Truman]], and became effective on May 31, 1951. Article 125 forbids sodomy among all military personnel, defining it as "any person subject to this chapter who engages in unnatural carnal copulation with another person of the same or opposite sex or with an animal is guilty of sodomy. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the offence."&lt;ref name="usni"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.usni.org/news-and-features/dont-ask-dont-tell/timeline |title=Key Dates in US Policy on Gay Men and Women in the United States Military |publisher=usni.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the 2003 United States Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces|Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces]] ruled that the decision applied to Article 125, severely narrowing the previous ban on sodomy. In both ''United States v. Stirewalt'' and ''[[United States v. Marcum]]'', the court ruled that the "conduct [consensual sodomy] falls within the liberty interest identified by the Supreme Court,"&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces: [http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2004Term/03-0433.htm U.S. v. Stirewalt, September 29, 2004], accessed August 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but went on to say that despite the application of ''Lawrence'' to the military, Article 125 can still be upheld in cases where there are "factors unique to the military environment" that would place the conduct "outside any protected liberty interest recognized in ''Lawrence''."&lt;ref name=marcum&gt;U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces: [http://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/opinions/2004Term/02-0944.htm U.S. v. Marcum, August 23, 2004], accessed August 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such factors include [[rape]], [[fraternization]], public sexual behavior, or any other factors that would adversely affect good order and discipline. Convictions for consensual sodomy have been overturned in military courts under ''Lawrence'' in both ''United States v. Meno''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/legal/cca/court_of_criminal_appeals_opinions/Year2008/20080409%20United%20States%20v.%20Smith%2066%20MJ%20556.pdf |title=United States v. Webster M. Smith |publisher=Uscg.mil |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''United States v. Bullock''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=United States v.

On December 26, 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] signed the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014]] into law, replacing the sodomy prohibition provision with forcible sodomy and [[bestiality]] prohibition provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Chris|title=Defense bill contains gay-related provisions |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/12/20/defense-bill-contains-gay-related-provisions/|accessdate=December 21, 2019|newspaper=Washington Blade|date=December 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics''' ('''SCCE''') is a [[nonprofit]], individual membership association which provides resources for ethics and compliance professionals from various industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blickenwolf.com/Industry/IndustryResources.asp Compliance Industry]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves over 5,500 members through publications, education programs, conferences and professional networking, including an online social network called SCCEnet, which has over 14,000 registered users.[http://community.corporatecompliance.org]&lt;ref&gt;SCCE and HCCA Social Networks Now Open to All Compliance and Ethics Professionals [http://www.csrwire.com/press/press_release/19783-SCCE-and-HCCA-Social-Networks-Now-Open-to-All-Compliance-and-Ethics-Professionals]&lt;/ref&gt; SCCE also helps individuals become Certified [[Compliance (regulation)|Compliance]] and [[Ethics]] Professionals.

== History ==

The first National Symposium on Corporate Responsibility: Compliance &amp; Ethics Programs was held on November 21-22, 2002, sponsored by the [[Health Care Compliance Association]] (HCCA) in association with [[Microsoft]] Corporation in [[Redmond, Washington]]. The conference drew 100 attendees from some of the top corporations in the nation including [[DuPont]], [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], [[Amazon.com]], [[Boeing]], [[Starbucks]], the [[University of Texas]] and many more. The keynote speaker was [[William C. Powers]] Jr. who served as Chairman of the Special Investigative Committee of the Board of Directors of [[Enron]] Corporation.

Requests for a second Symposium were answered in 2003. More than 250 attendees filled the room to hear speakers such as James Sheehan, Associate United States Attorney for Civil Programs; Ron James, CEO, Center for Ethical Business Cultures; Honorable Michael E. Horowitz, Commissioner, United States Sentencing Commission; and Colleen Rowley, Special Agent, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. Their mission was clear, there needed to be a forum for business professionals working in the compliance and ethics field.&lt;ref&gt;[[Regulatory compliance|Regulatory Compliance]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Compliance and Ethics Institute [http://www.complianceethicsinstitute.org] now attracts approximately 1500 attendees annually and the SCCE has grown to over 5,500 members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corporatecompliance.org/AboutSCCE/History.aspx SCCE History]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education, publications and events ==

The SCCE offers publications and live training&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/society-of-corporate-compliance-and-ethics-announces-upper-midwest-regional-compliance-and-ethics-conference-october-9-2009-embassy-suites-minneapolis-airport-bloomington-mn-62363637.html "Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics Announces Upper Midwest Regional Compliance and Ethics Conference, October 9, 2009, Embassy Suites Minneapolis Airport, Bloomington, MN"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corporatecompliance.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Events1&amp;Template=/TaggedPage/TaggedPageDisplay.cfm&amp;TPLID=8&amp;ContentID=1429 SCCE Events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027223804/http://www.corporatecompliance.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Events1&amp;Template=%2FTaggedPage%2FTaggedPageDisplay.cfm&amp;TPLID=8&amp;ContentID=1429 |date=2009-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to its members. These resources cover the range of challenges faced by compliance professionals in managing compliance and ethics programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metrocorpcounsel.com/current.php?artType=view&amp;EntryNo=1762 Announcing The Society Of Corporate Compliance And Ethics]
&lt;/ref&gt; The SCCE addresses regulatory topics such as [[sexual harassment]], [[antitrust]]/anti-competition, [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]]/anti-bribery, export control and more, as well as the broad challenge of managing a program designed to meet the [[United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines]] definition of an effective compliance program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussc.gov/orgguide.htm Organizational Sentencing Guidelines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123033209/http://www.ussc.gov/orgguide.htm |date=2010-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SCCE’s members enjoy access to a repository of over 4,000 electronic documents including white papers and government memorandum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.corporatecompliance.org/CORPORATECOMPLIANCE/CORPORATECOMPLIANCE/Resources/Default.aspx SCCE Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225143841/http://community.corporatecompliance.org/CORPORATECOMPLIANCE/CORPORATECOMPLIANCE/Resources/Default.aspx |date=2010-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Certification ==

The SCCE worked with the Compliance Certification Board (CCB) to develop an examination certification in compliance and ethics. To date over 1200 people have obtained the Certified Compliance and Ethics Professional Certification (CCEP).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compliancecertification.org/CCEP/CertifiedComplianceEthicsProfessional.aspx SCCE CCEP Certification]&lt;/ref&gt; The CCEP Fellow and CCEP International certifications has also been added.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compliancecertification.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Code of Professional Ethics ==

On August 29, 2007, The Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics (SCCE) adopted a Code of Professional Ethics for Compliance and Ethics Professionals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corporatecompliance.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Resources/ProfessionalCode/SCCECodeOfEthics_English.pdf SCCE Code of Professional Ethics for Compliance and Ethics Professionals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807061118/http://www.corporatecompliance.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Resources/ProfessionalCode/SCCECodeOfEthics_English.pdf |date=2009-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Code’s purpose is to provide guidance and rules to all Compliance and Ethics Professionals (CEP) in the performance of their professional responsibilities.
In creating the Code of Professional Ethics, the SCCE establishes both overarching principles to guide compliance officials and rules of conduct, which represent specific standards that prescribe the minimum level of professional conduct expected of CEPs.

{{Refimprove|date=April 2010}}

A '''testamentary trust''' (sometimes referred to as a '''will trust''' or '''trust under will''') is a [[trust law|trust]] which arises upon the death of the [[testator]], and which is specified in his or her [[Will (law)|will]]. A will may contain more than one testamentary trust, and may address all or any portion of the [[Estate (law)|estate]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.freeadvice.com/estate_planning/wills/testamentary-trust-will.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Testamentary trusts are distinguished from [[inter vivos trust|''inter vivos'' trusts]], which are created during the settlor's lifetime.

There are four parties involved in a testamentary trust:
*the person who specifies that the trust be created, usually as a part of his or her will, but it may be set up in abeyance during the person's lifetime. This person may be called the ''grantor'' or ''trustor'', but is usually referred to as the ''[[settlor]]'';
*the ''[[trustee]]'', whose duty is to carry out the terms of the will. He or she may be named in the will, or may be appointed by the [[probate court]] that handles the will;
*the ''beneficiary(s)'', who will receive the benefits of the trust;
*Although not a party to the trust itself, the ''probate court'' is a necessary component of the trust's activity.  It oversees the trustee's handling of the trust.

A testamentary trust is a legal arrangement created as specified in a person's will, and is occasioned by the death of that person. It is created to address any estate accumulated during that person's lifetime or generated as a result of a postmortem lawsuit, such as a settlement in a survival claim, or the proceeds from a [[life insurance]] policy held on the settlor. A trust can be created to oversee such assets. A trustee is appointed to direct the trust until a set time when the trust expires, such as when minor beneficiaries reach a specified age or accomplish a deed such as completing a set educational goal or achieving a specified matrimonial status.

For a testamentary trust, as the settlor is deceased, he or she will generally not have any influence over the trustee's exercise of discretion, although in some jurisdictions it is common for the testator to leave a [[letter of wishes]] for the trustee. In practical terms testamentary trusts tend to be driven more by the needs of the beneficiaries (particularly infant beneficiaries) than by [[tax]] considerations, which are the usual considerations in ''inter vivos'' trusts.

If a testamentary trust fails, the property usually will be held on [[resulting trust]]s for the testator's [[residuary estate]]. Some famous English trust law cases were on behalf of the residuary legatees under a will seeking to have testamentary trusts declared [[void (law)|void]] so as to inherit the trust property. An infamous example is ''[[Re Diplock]]'' [1951] Ch 253, which resulted in the suicide of one of the trustees who was personally liable to account for trust funds that had been disbursed for what he thought were perfectly valid [[charitable trust]]s).

==Advantages of a testamentary trust==
*A testamentary trust provides a way for assets devolving to minor children to be protected until the children are capable of fending for themselves;&lt;ref name="testatewill.com"&gt;http://testatewill.com/trusts/pot-trust-unequal-shares-children/&lt;/ref&gt;
*A testamentary trust has low upfront costs, usually only the cost of preparing the will in such a way as to address the trust, and the fees involved in dealing with the judicial system during probate.&lt;ref name="wisegeek.com"&gt;http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-testamentary-trust.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages of a testamentary trust==
*The trustee is required to meet with the probate court regularly (at least annually in many jurisdictions) and prove that the trust is being handled in a responsible manner and in strict accordance with provisions of the will which created the trust. This may involve considerable legal fees, especially if the trust endures for several years or involves a sophisticated financial or investment structure, and always involves the fees imposed by the judicial system. Such fees and expenses are deducted from the principal of the estate;
*The trustee must be prepared to oversee the trust for its duration, which involves a considerable commitment in time, possible emotional attachment, and legal liability;
*A candidate for trustee may be named in the will, but that person has no legal obligation to accept the appointment. If no trustee is named in the will (or is unavailable, even if named), the probate court will appoint a trustee; 
*It can be difficult for beneficiaries to bring a dishonest trustee to account. They may sue at law, or the malfeasance may be pointed out at the annual probate court review, but such remedies are slow, time-consuming and expensive, and are not guaranteed to succeed.

==Summary==
Due to the potential problems, lawyers often advise that a ''revocable living trust'' or ''inter vivos trust'' be created instead of a testamentary trust. However, a testamentary trust may be a better solution if the expected estate is small compared to potential life-insurance settlement amounts.

'''''Texas Monthly v. Bullock''''', 489 U.S. 1 (1989),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock|489|1|1989}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a case brought before the [[US Supreme Court]] in November 1988. The case (initiated by the publishers of ''[[Texas Monthly]]'', a well-known general-interest magazine in [[Texas]]) was to test the legality of a Texas statute that exempted religious publications from paying [[U.S. state|state]] [[sales tax]].

The Court, in a 6-3 decision lacking a majority, overturned an appellate court's decision that the exemption was constitutional and remanded the case.

==History==
Prior to October 2, 1984, Texas exempted from sales tax "magazine subscriptions running half a year or longer and entered as second class mail." The exemption applied to any subscription regardless of its content.

Beginning on that date, it repealed the exemption (it would later reinstate it in its entirety from October 1, 1987). However, from 1984 to 1987, it maintained an exemption for "periodicals published or distributed by a religious faith consisting entirely of writings promulgating the teaching of the faith, along with books consisting solely of writings sacred to a religious faith."

The publishers of ''[[Texas Monthly]]'', a popular and well-known general-interest magazine that did not qualify for the exemption, challenged the exemption by paying over $400,000 in sales taxes for 1985 under protest and filing suit in [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] District Court to recover the taxes paid. It agreed by striking down the statute as a violation of both the [[Establishment Clause]] and the [[Free Press Clause]] and ordering the State of Texas to refund the taxes paid and interest.

However, the Third [[Texas Court of Appeals]] reversed in a 2-1 decision. It determined that the tax exemption met the tests required under ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'' (1971),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Lemon v. Kurtzman|volume=403|page=602|pin=|year=1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and so did not violate the Establishment Clause. In addition, the Court of Appeals determined that the tax exemption did not violate the Free Press Clause, as only a few publications were qualified.

==Decision==
===Brennan's majority opinion===
[[William J. Brennan, Jr.|Justice Brennan]], [[Thurgood Marshall|Justice Marshall]], and [[John Paul Stevens|Justice Stevens]] based their plurality opinion in the Establishment Clause: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." As had been decided in earlier cases, Congress cannot establish a religion or even pass a law with the purpose of advancing religion in respect to non-religion.

The lack of a sales tax on religious literature was in effect a subsidy to the religious writers. If the religious writers did not pay a tax, then a secular writer would have to. That would in essence force tax payers, religious or not, to pay for a subsidy to religions. They held that had the statute been broader, including charities, for example, it would have been constitutional. Justice Brennan recognized the argument of Texas that taxing the publications may inhibit their ability to function to some extent thereby going against the Free Exercise Clause which states continuing from the above clause "or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." However, Justice Brennan argued that if all [[People of the United States|American]] people were required to pay the tax it did not unduly burden religion to pay the tax nor "prohibit" them from exercising as they wished.

===White's concurring opinion===
[[Byron White|Justice White]] concurred in the judgment but argued that under the Court's prior precedent in ''[[Arkansas Writers' Project v. Ragland]]'' (1987),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland|volume=481|page=221|pin=|year=1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Texas Law violated the [[Press Clause]] by taxing ''Texas Monthly'' but exempting other publishers solely on the basis of the religious content of their publications.

===Blackmun's concurring opinion===
[[Harry Blackmun|Justice Blackmun]] concurred in the judgment and wrote an opinion, joined by [[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O'Connor]], disagreeing with both the plurality and the dissenting opinions. He argued that the opinion does not recognize enough the [[Free Exercise Clause]], and the dissent does not recognize the [[Establishment Clause]]. He argued that to understand the case, both clauses must be seen along with the Press Clause, which states "Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech."

When religious writings are given certain perks like a pass on sales tax, the freedom of speech of the other writers is inhibited because they have to pay sales tax. Free speech is not inhibited enough to be an issue and so one must decide where the line is between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause. He argued that had the law been written to include other philosophical literature encouraging morality, it may have stood, but when it expressly focused on religion the Establishment Clause had been violated: "In this case, by confining the tax exemption exclusively to the sale of religious publications, Texas engaged in preferential support for the communication of religious messages."

===Scalia's dissenting opinion===
[[Antonin Scalia|Justice Scalia]] wrote a [[dissenting opinion]], joined by [[William Rehnquist|Chief Justice Rehnquist]] and [[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]], refuting the arguments of Justices Brennan and Blackmun. He extensively cited ''[[Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York]]'' (1970),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York|volume=397|page=664|pin=|year=1970}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where the Court found a New York law allowing religions and other non-profit organizations to not pay property tax. He argued that even though it included non-profit organizations, the Court had ruled specifically in favor of the exemptions for religions stating in Walz: "We find it unnecessary to justify the tax exemption of the social welfare services or 'good works' that some churches perform." He stated that though a tax exemption is similar economically to a subsidy, when discussing the Establishment Clause, they are different as found in ''Walz''.

Also, a line must be drawn between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause but sees more room between them. He argued that just because a law is not necessary for the Free Exercise Clause does not mean that it is unconstitutional on Establishment Clause grounds. He also notes that it passes all three prongs of the [[Lemon v. Kurtzman|''Lemon'' test]] by not overly entangling the church and state.

The '''Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977''' ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/50/contents c 50]) is an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom]] which regulates [[contract]]s by restricting the operation and legality of some [[Contractual term|contract terms]]. It extends to nearly all forms of contract and one of its most important functions is limiting the applicability of [[disclaimer]]s of [[legal liability|liability]]. The terms extend to both actual contract terms and notices that are seen to constitute a contractual obligation.

The Act renders terms excluding or limiting liability ineffective or subject to reasonableness, depending on the nature of the obligation purported to be excluded and whether the party purporting to exclude or limit business liability, acting against a ''consumer''.

It is normally used in conjunction with the [[Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999]] ([[Statutory Instrument]] 1999 No. 2083),&lt;ref&gt;as amended by the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts (Amendment) Regulations 2001 ([[Statutory Instrument]] 2001 No. 1186) which merely further defined a 'Financial Service Authority'&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] and the [[Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982]].

The [[Law Commission]] and the [[Scottish Law Commission]] have recommended that the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 and the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 should be replaced by a more unified and coherent regime.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/project/unfair-terms-in-contracts/ The Law Commission, 'Unfair Terms in Contracts' (LC292, 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms rendered ineffective==
{{Contract law}}
'''[[Negligence]]'''. s2(1), [[legal liability|liability]] for negligence occasioning death or personal injury cannot be excluded.

'''Manufacturers' guarantee'''. s5(1), loss arising from (a) defective goods or (b) negligence of distributor; cannot be excluded where goods are "of a type ordinarily supplied for private use or consumption."

'''[[Sale of Goods Act 1979|Sale of Goods]]'''
*s6(1), implied terms as to title ([[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] s12) cannot be excluded.
*s6(2), implied terms as to description, quality or [[Sample (material)|sample]] ([[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] ss13-15) cannot be excluded ''against a consumer''.

'''Terms governed by the [[Consumer Protection Act 1987]]'''.

They are also governed (since 2007) by the [[Occupiers Liability Act 1984]].

==Terms subject to reasonableness==
'''[[Negligence]].''' s2(2), exclusion of liability for all types of negligence (other than for death or personal injury which is banned) must satisfy the requirement of ''reasonableness''.

'''Contractual Liability.''' s3, This applies against a party that deals on standard written terms or where the other party deals as a ''consumer''. Any exclusion by that party for liability arising from a [[Breach of contract|breach]] committed by that party under the same contract (s3(2)(a)) or performance under a contract which is substantially or totally different of that which is reasonably expected of him (s(3)(b)) shall be void except insofar as it satisfies the requirement of reasonableness.

'''[[Indemnity]] clauses.''' s4, A party dealing as a ''consumer'' cannot contract to indemnify a third party on behalf of the other party, except insofar as it satisfies the requirement of ''reasonableness''.

'''Sale of Goods.''' s6(3), [[Implied terms]] as to description, quality and [[Sample (material)|sample]] ([[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] ss 13-15) may only be reasonably excluded where neither party is dealing as a ''consumer''.

'''[[Misrepresentation]].''' s8, substitutes the [[Misrepresentation Act 1967]] s3. Under that post-1979 section, an exclusion of liability for misrepresentation must satisfy the requirement of reasonableness.

==Definition of ''consumer'' and ''business''==

'''Business.''' s 1(3), The Act only applies to "liability for breach of obligations or duties arising (a) from things done or to be done by a person in the course of a business (whether his own business or another's); or (b) from the occupation of premises used for business purposes of the occupier". s14, Includes any government department.

'''Consumer.''' s 12,&lt;ref name="s12amm"&gt;As amended by the [[Sale and Supply of Goods to Consumers Regulations 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt; A party deals as a consumer if
*s12(1)(a), He is not in the course of a business and does not hold himself to do so.&lt;ref name="s121note"&gt;Holding himself is important as an otherwise consumer may attempt to act in the guise of a business for tax benefits or to shop at wholesale stores&lt;/ref&gt;
*s12(1)(b), the other party is in the course of a business.
*s12(1)(c), In Sale of Goods contract, the goods are of a type "ordinarily supplied for private use or consumption" (s12(1A), this subsection does not apply to individuals)
*s12(2), A party is not a consumer if dealing at an [[auction]] where he has the opportunity to attend in person or is not a [[natural person]] buying auction.
*s12(3), Burden is upon the party purported to be acting in the course of a business to show that either he is not in the course of a business or that the other party is otherwise not a consumer.

==Definition of ''reasonableness''==

'''Section 11''' provides some guidance but most development has been in [[common law]].

'''Schedule 2''' gives guidelines specifically to ss 6(3), 7(3), 7(4).

'''Common Law'''
*''[[Stewart Gill Ltd v Horatio Myer &amp; Co Ltd]]''&lt;ref name="stewcase"&gt;[1992] 2 All ER 257&lt;/ref&gt; provides that reasonableness is assessed at the time of contract; and that the burden of proof is upon the party purporting to have excluded liability.
*''[[Levison v Patent Steam Carpet Cleaning Co Ltd]]''&lt;ref name="levicase"&gt;[1977] 3 WLR 90&lt;/ref&gt; provides that clarity and preciseness will raise the reasonableness of a term; and vice versa. See also ''[[Stag Line Ltd v Tyne Ship Repair Group Ltd]]''&lt;ref name="stagcase"&gt;[1984] 2 Lloyd's Rep 211&lt;/ref&gt; as to small print (literally – relating to the size of the lettering).
*''[[Smith v Eric S Bush]]''.&lt;ref name="yiancase"&gt;[1990] 1 AC 831&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Griffith provides 4 points that may be considered... (see application in ''[[St Albans City and District Council v International Computers Ltd]]''.&lt;ref name="albacase"&gt;(1996) ''The Times'' 14 August&lt;/ref&gt;).
**Equality of bargaining powers.
**How practical was it to obtain independent legal advice regarding the term?
**How difficult is the task being undertaken for which liability is being excluded?
**What are the practical consequences of ruling that a term is unreasonable?

The '''United Front Against Fascism''' (UFAF) was an [[anti-fascist]] conference organized by the [[Black Panther Party]] and held in [[Oakland]], [[California]], from July 18 to 21, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Joshua|last1=Bloom|first2=Waldo E., Jr.|last2=Martin|authorlink2=Waldo Martin|title=Black against Empire: The History and Politics of the Black Panther Party|year=2013|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=Berkeley|ref=harv|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The May 31, 1969 issue of ''[[The Black Panther (newspaper)|The Black Panther]]'' called for a "Revolutionary Conference for a United Front Against Fascism," to be held in Oakland in July of that year.{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=299}} The announcement drew links between the killing of [[James Rector (student)|James Rector]] and the imprisonment of [[Huey Newton]], and outlined the purpose of the conference: it would develop a political programme representing the "poor, black, oppressed workers and people of America", involving strategies for community control of policing, the release of [[political prisoners]], the expulsion of the military from college and university campuses, and community self-defense.{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=299}}

==Event==
Around 5,000 people responded to the call, including members of the [[Communist Party USA]],&lt;ref name=spencer/&gt; the [[Peace and Freedom Party]],{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=300}} the [[Progressive Labor Party (United States)|Progressive Labor Party]],&lt;ref name=spencer/&gt;{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=300}} the [[Red Guard Party]],{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=300}} the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]],&lt;ref name=spencer/&gt; [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS),&lt;ref name=spencer/&gt;{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=300}}&lt;ref name=kpix/&gt; the [[Third World Liberation Front]],&lt;ref name=spencer/&gt;{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=300}} the [[Young Lords]],&lt;ref name=spencer/&gt;{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=300}} the [[Young Patriots Organization]],&lt;ref name=spencer&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dukeupress.wordpress.com/2017/01/26/the-black-panther-party-and-black-anti-fascism-in-the-united-states/|title=The Black Panther Party and Black Anti-fascism in the United States|date=January 26, 2017|accessdate=July 28, 2018|first=Robyn C.|last=Spencer|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=300}} the [[Young Socialist Alliance]]{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=300}} and various groups associated with the [[women's liberation movement in North America|women's liberation movement]].{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=300}} Events took place in the [[Oakland Auditorium]] and DeFremery Park.{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=300}} Delegates included [[Asian Americans]], [[Latino]]s and other [[people of color]], but the majority in attendance were white.{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=300}} Members of SDS were ejected from the auditorium for "disruptive behavior," and the following day distributed pamphlets which accused organizers of excluding them.&lt;ref name=kpix&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/207569|title=Conference for a United Front Against Fascism|date=July 19, 1969|publisher=[[KPIX-TV]]|via=[[Bay Area Television Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speeches were given on the first day of the congress. The second day was devoted to workshops on issues around [[fascism]], gender, workers and students, political prisoners, health, religion, state repression of political dissent and policing.&lt;ref name=spencer/&gt; Speakers included [[Bob Avakian]]&lt;ref name=kpix/&gt; and [[Jeff Jones (activist)|Jeff Jones]]{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=301}} of SDS; [[Elaine Brown]], who presented a letter from [[Ericka Huggins]] who was at that time incarcerated;{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=301}} the politician [[Ron Dellums]];{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=301}} and the lawyers [[Charles Garry]]{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=302}} and [[William Kunstler]],{{sfn|Bloom|Martin|2013|p=301}} the latter of whom discussed the [[1967 Plainfield, New Jersey riots]] and argued for the legality and necessity of defensive violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Curtis J.|last=Austin|title=Up Against the Wall: Violence in the Making and Unmaking of the Black Panther Party|publisher=[[University of Arkansas Press]]|year=2006|location=Fayetteville|ref=harv|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=iRACjD1JdMkC|pages=97–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the congress the [[National Committees to Combat Fascism]], a national network that sought community control of police forces, was established.&lt;ref name=spencer/&gt;{{sfn|Austin|2006|p=249}}

==Significance==

In 2017 the historian Robyn C. Spencer connected the UFAF to contemporary [[antifascism in the United States]], and argued that &lt;blockquote&gt;The history of the UFAF demonstrates that discussions about fascism in the US are nothing new. It shifts the discussion of fascism away from an [[American exceptionalist]] terrain where the US is compared with Europe and government structures or despotic leaders are analyzed and instead demonstrates the value of unearthing manifestations of fascism in the lived experiences of Black people in the US.&lt;ref name=spencer/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:ItaLemettiDivisioonanLippu.jpg|thumb|Flag, trophy of the [[Winter War]]]]

In ancient Greece and Rome, military victories were commemorated with a display of captured arms and [[Heraldic standard|standards]]. A [[trophy]] (from the Greek [[tropaion]]) was originally a [[war memorial]] assembled from such items on a battlefield. The [[Roman triumph]] also displayed these items as well as cultural objects, which later came to be called war trophies. Body parts of slain enemies have sometimes served as trophies since antiquity, in a practice called [[human trophy collecting]]. The recovery of [[Aquila (Roman)|Roman eagles]] taken as trophies by enemy forces sometimes inspired years of added warfare. 
[[Image:1st Battalion, 71st Regiment of Foot Colours.svg|thumb|right|1st Battalion, [[71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot|71st Regiment of Foot]] colours captured by the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]] troops during the [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata|first British invasion]] in 1806 and exhibited as a war trophy at the [[Santo Domingo convent]], in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name="War Trophy"&gt;{{cite book |title=Trofeos de la Reconquista de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires en el Año 1806 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIMyAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Trofeos+De+La+Reconquista+De+La+Ciudad+De+Buenos+Aires&amp;dq=Trofeos+De+La+Reconquista+De+La+Ciudad+De+Buenos+Aires&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X_GJU4nsJ-PQsQSP8YCgDw&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwAg |location=Buenos Aires |publisher=Litografía, Imprenta y Encuadernación de Guillermo Kraft  |language=Spanish |year=1882 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In more recent times, it has been common for soldiers to return home with souvenirs, such as enemy weapons and flags, while larger military items captured in battle, particularly weaponry such as machine guns and artillery pieces, became the property of the state to which the soldiers responsible for the capture belonged.&lt;ref name="victor" /&gt;

In the 20th century, the victorious alliance states removed large quantities of property, including cultural objects.&lt;ref name="looted art" /&gt; After the [[First World War]], the [[Treaty of Versailles]] authorized the removal of large amounts of property from Germany, which it termed "[[World War I reparations|reparations]]".

After the [[Second World War]], the [[Potsdam Conference]] authorized the removal of certain property from Germany, such as the merchant marine fleet. Germany, during the war, had removed large quantities of [[Nazi plunder|property]] from the countries that it had occupied. In some cases, for example the Soviet "trophy brigades", official looting was [[euphemism|euphemised]] as the taking of "trophies".

== Cultural objects ==
{{see also|Looted art}}

Article 56 of the [[Hague Convention of 1907]],&lt;ref name="avalon" /&gt; stated:

{{quote |
The property of municipalities, that of institutions dedicated to religion, charity and education, the arts and sciences, even when State property, shall be treated as private property.

All seizure of, destruction or wilful damage done to institutions of this character, historic monuments, works of art and science, is forbidden, and should be made the subject of legal proceedings.
}}

However, the article was not much respected during the remainder of the century.

In 1954, a further convention was signed at the Hague: ''[[Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]]'', and two protocols have strengthened its force.&lt;ref name="unesco 1954 Convention" /&gt;

Many works of art moved from their pre-war locations during the turmoils of the 20th century. [[UNESCO]], the [[United Nations]] agency responsible for culture has been seeking to resolve issues relating to cultural objects displaced in connection with the Second World War.&lt;ref name="unesco return" /&gt; However, the conference in Spring 2007 failed to reach a consensus on a draft non-binding declaration.&lt;ref name="unesco wwii objects" /&gt;

The '''Watergate Seven''' has come to refer to two different groups of people, but both fall in the context of the [[Watergate scandal]]. First, it can refer to the five men caught June 17, 1972, burglarizing the Democratic National Committee's headquarters in the Watergate Hotel, along with their two handlers, [[E.&amp;nbsp;Howard Hunt]] and [[G.&amp;nbsp;Gordon Liddy]], who were Nixon campaign aides. All seven were tried before [[Judge John Sirica]] in January 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2002/06/11/AR2005112200811_3.html |title=The Watergate Watershed A Turning Point for a Nation and a Newspaper | work=The Washington Post | first=Katharine |last=Graham |date=January 28, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The second use of '''Watergate Seven''' refers to seven advisors and aides of [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Richard M. Nixon]] who were indicted by a grand jury on March 1, 1974, for their role in the [[Watergate scandal]]. The grand jury also named Nixon as an [[unindicted co-conspirator|unindicted conspirator]]. The indictments marked the first time in [[U.S. history]] that a president was so named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Watergate Exposed: How the President of the United States and the Watergate Burglars Were Set Up As Told to Douglas Caddy, Original Attorney for the Watergate Seven |last=Merritt |first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Merritt |author2=Doug Caddy  |year=2011 |publisher=Trine Day |isbn=193629611X |page= |pages=288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weicker Jr.]]'s indicating that one of the men in Watergate bugging case had been ordered in the spring of 1972 to keep certain Senators and Representatives under [[surveillance]], posted a sign on the door of his [[United States Congress]] office saying, "These premises were surveilled by the Watergate Seven.

The '''Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989''', 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8)-(9), Pub.L. 101-12 as amended, is a United States federal law that protects federal [[whistleblowers]] who work for the government and report the possible existence of an activity constituting a violation of law, rules, or regulations, or mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority or a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety. A federal agency violates the Whistleblower Protection Act if agency authorities take (or threaten to take) retaliatory personnel action against any employee or applicant because of disclosure of information by that employee or applicant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-103/pdf/STATUTE-103-Pg16.pdf Public Law 101-12 (1989)] at gpo.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorized Federal Agencies==
* The [[Office of Special Counsel]] investigates federal whistleblower complaints. In October 2008, then-special counsel [[Scott Bloch]] resigned amid an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation into whether he obstructed justice by illegally deleting computer files following complaints that he had retaliated against employees who disagreed with his policies. Then-Senator [[Barack Obama]] made a campaign vow to appoint a special counsel committed to whistleblower rights.  It was not until April 2011 that President Obama's appointee [[Carolyn Lerner]] was confirmed by the Senate. Today, the primary mission of OSC is to safeguard the merit system by protecting federal employees and applicants from prohibited personnel practices, especially reprisal for whistleblowing.
* The [[Merit Systems Protection Board]], a quasi-judicial agency that adjudicates whistleblower complaints, uses appointed administrative law judges who often back the government. Since 2000, the board has ruled for whistleblowers just three times in 56 cases decided on their merits, according to a [[Government Accountability Project]] analysis. Obama appointed a new chairperson and vice chairperson with backgrounds as federal worker advocates, but [[Thomas M. Devine|Tom Devine]] of GAP says, "It's likely to take years for them to turn things around." Currently, this office works to protect the Merit System Principles and promote an effective Federal workforce free of Prohibited Personnel Practices.
* The [[Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] was established under Article III of the Constitution on October 1, 1982. It is the only court empowered to hear appeals of whistleblower cases decided by the merit board, has been criticized by [[Chuck Grassley|Senator Grassley]] (R-Iowa) and others in Congress for misinterpreting whistleblower laws and setting a precedent that is hostile to claimants. Between 1994 and 2010, the court had ruled for whistleblowers in only three of 203 cases decided on their merits, GAP's analysis found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2010-03-14-whistleblowers_N.htm | title=Whistleblowers | author=Peter Eisler | newspaper=USA TODAY | date=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal Cases==
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], in the case of [[Garcetti v. Ceballos]], 04-473, ruled in 2006 that [[Civil service|government employees]] do not have protection from retaliation by their employers under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the Constitution when they speak pursuant to their official job duties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/05/30/national/w132119D75.DTL&amp;type=politics High Court Trims Whistleblower Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;
The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) uses agency lawyers in the place of [[administrative law judges]] to decide federal employees' whistleblower appeals.  These lawyers, dubbed "attorney examiners," deny 98% of whistleblower appeals; the Board and the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals give great deference to their initial decisions, resulting in affirmance rates of 97% and 98%, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Robert J.[http://www.wm.edu/as/publicpolicy/wm_policy_review/Archives/Volume%203/McCarthy.pdf "Blowing in the Wind: Answers for Federal Whistleblowers"]. ''William &amp; Mary Policy Review'' 3:184 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The most common characteristics for a court claim that are encompassed within the protection of the Act include: that the plaintiff is an employee or person covered under the specific statutory or common law relied upon for action, that the defendant is an employer or person covered under the specific statutory or common law relied upon for the action, that the plaintiff engaged in protected whistleblower activity, that the defendant knew or had knowledge that the plaintiff engaged in such activity, that there was retaliatory action taken against the one doing the whistleblowing and that the unfair treatment would not have occurred if the plaintiff hadn't brought to attention the activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whistleblowers.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=63|title=Know Your Rights FAQ|publisher=[[National Whistleblowers Center]]|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert MacLean]] blew the whistle on the fact that the [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] had cut its funding for more [[sky marshal|air marshal]]s. In 2009 MacLean, represented by the Government Accountability Project, challenged his dismissal at the Merit Systems Protection Board, on the grounds that "his disclosure of the text message was protected under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, because he 'reasonably believe[d]' that the leaked information disclosed 'a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety'." MacLean won the case in a ruling of 7–2 in the Supreme Court in January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://couragefound.org/2014/11/whistleblower-protection-case-reaches-us-supreme-court/|title=Whistleblower protection case reaches US Supreme Court|publisher=[[Courage Foundation]]|date=November 7, 2014|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act and Presidential Policy Directive 19==

President [[Barack Obama]] issued Presidential Policy Directive 19 (PPD-19), entitled "Protecting Whistleblowers with Access to Classified Information". According to the law signed by Obama on October 10, 2012, it is written that "this Presidential Policy Directive ensures that employees (1) serving in the Intelligence Community or (2) who are eligible for access to classified information can effectively report waste, fraud, and abuse while protecting classified
national security information. It prohibits retaliation against employees for reporting waste, fraud, and abuse.&lt;ref&gt;https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/image/ppd-19.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to a report that  the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs submitted to accompany S. 743, "the federal whistleblowers have seen their protections diminish in recent years, largely as a result of a series of decisions by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which has exclusive jurisdiction over many cases brought under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA). Specifically, the Federal Circuit has wrongly accorded a narrow definition to the type of disclosure that qualifies for whistleblower protection. Additionally, the lack of remedies under current law for most whistleblowers in the intelligence community and for whistleblowers who face retaliation in the form of withdrawal of the employee's security clearance leaves unprotected those who are in a position to disclose wrongdoing that directly affects our national security."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-112srpt155/pdf/CRPT-112srpt155.pdf WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2012 REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS, UNITED STATES SENATE TO ACCOMPANY S. 743]. April 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
S. 743 would address these problems by restoring the original congressional intent of the WPA to adequately protect whistleblowers, by strengthening the WPA, and by creating new whistleblower protections for intelligence employees and new protections for employees whose security clearance is withdrawn in retaliation for having made legitimate whistleblower disclosures.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-112srpt155/pdf/CRPT-112srpt155.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  S. 743 ultimately became Pub.L. 112-199 (S.Rep. 112-155).

{{update|section|date=January 2017}}
On July 14, 2014, the [[United States House of Representatives]] voted to pass the [[All Circuit Review Extension Act (H.R. 4197; 113th Congress)]], a bill that gives authority to federal employees who want to appeal their judgment to any federal court, and which allows whistleblowers to appeal to any U.S. Court of Appeals that has jurisdiction. The bill would extend from three years after the effective date of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (i.e., December 27, 2012), the period allowed for: (1) filing a petition for judicial review of [[Merit Systems Protection Board]] decisions in whistleblower cases, and (2) any review of such a decision by the Director of the [[Office of Personnel Management]] (OPM).&lt;ref name=4197sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4197 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4197|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=4197allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 4197 - All Actions|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4197/all-actions|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a bill in its early stages called the FBI Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act.{{when|date=January 2017}} This bill was introduced by Senators Grassley and Leahy in 2015. It would protect whistleblowers in the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] more completely from reprisals by supervisors, by assigning administrative law judges to adjudicate the cases, and enabling FBI employees to appeal their decisions to the courts.

'''Åke Green''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈoːkɛ ˈɡreːn|lang}}; born 3 June 1941) is a Swedish [[Pentecostal]] [[Christian]] pastor who was prosecuted, but [[acquitted]], under Sweden's law against [[hate speech]] because of critical opinions on [[homosexuality]] in his [[sermon]]s. The [[Judicial system of Sweden#Courts|district court]] found him guilty and sentenced him to one month in prison. The sentence was appealed to the court of appeals ([[hovrätt]]). On 11 February 2005, the [[Göta Court of Appeal]] overturned the decision and acquitted Åke Green. On 9 March, the [[Prosecutor-General of Sweden|Prosecutor-General]] (''Riksåklagaren'') appealed this decision to the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Supreme Court]], which on 29 November also acquitted.

The Supreme Court stated that Åke Green had violated Swedish law as it currently stands regarding agitation against groups, and that the constitutionally guaranteed [[freedom of expression]] as well as [[freedom of religion]] does not protect him. However, the  Supreme Court also stated that the  [[freedom of expression]] as well as [[freedom of religion]] provided by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which is superior to normal Swedish law according to the lex superior principle regarding the [[ECHR]] found in the Instrument of Government (Regeringsformen) 2:19, gives him protection, since  jurisprudence  shows that a conviction would probably not be upheld by the [[European Court of Justice|European Court]].&lt;ref name="TheLocal29"&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/2590/20051129/ The Local, 29 Nov 2005: Åke Green cleared over gay sermon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SupCourt"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120218220008/http://www.domstol.se/Domstolar/hogstadomstolen/Avgoranden/2005/Dom_pa_engelska_B_1050-05.pdf Judgment of the Supreme court of Sweden]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/pressmeddelanden.htm |title=Supreme court press release 2005-11-29 (In Swedish) |accessdate=2006-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217161725/http://www.hogstadomstolen.se/pressmeddelanden.htm |archivedate=17 February 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In 2002, the [[Riksdag]] included references to sexual orientation in a list of groups protected against persecution in the form of threats and expressions of disdain. The list appears in a section of Swedish [[criminal law]] (''Brottsbalken'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sweden.gov.se/content/1/c4/15/36/d74ceabc.pdf The Swedish Penal Code (English), chapter 16, section 8]&lt;/ref&gt; known as The Act on Agitation Against a National or Ethnic Group (''Lagen om hets mot folkgrupp'').

== The sermon ==
At his church in [[Borgholm]], Green delivered a sermon&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eaec.org/bibleanswers/ake_green_sermon.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in which he described "sexual perversions" (referencing homosexuality) as "abnormal, a horrible [[cancer]]ous [[tumor]] in the body of society."  He also said that a person cannot be a Christian and a homosexual at the same time.

Green had invited members of the media to attend the sermon, but none were present when he preached it in the presence of about fifty listeners. He wrote a summary of the sermon, including the above-mentioned quotes, which was printed in the local newspaper Ölandsbladet. A representative of nearby [[Kalmar]]'s [[RFSL]], an [[LGBT]] equal rights organization, reported the sermon to the police and the controversy began.&lt;ref&gt;Den svenska politiken - Struktur, processer och resultat. Henry Bäck, Torbjörn Larsson, 2006. p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The [[Judicial system of Sweden#Courts|district court]] found Åke Green guilty and sentenced him to one month in prison. The sentence was appealed to the court of appeals ([[hovrätt]]) and Green's lawyer maintained his client's religious freedom had been violated. On 11 February 2005 Göta hovrätt overturned the decision and acquitted Åke Green. On 9 March, the [[Prosecutor-General of Sweden|Prosecutor-General]] (''Riksåklagaren'') appealed this decision to the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Supreme Court]], which on 29 November also acquitted him.

The Supreme Court stated that Åke Green had violated Swedish hate speech law (''Lagen om hets mot folkgrupp'').  A conviction would probably not be upheld by the [[European Court of Human Rights|European Court]]&lt;ref name="TheLocal29"/&gt; considering Article 9 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which covers freedom of religion. After a discussion of the [[case law]] regarding Article 9 and 10 the court stated: "Under these circumstances, it is likely that the European Court, in a determination of the restriction of Åke Green’s right to preach his Biblically based opinion that a judgment of conviction would constitute, would find that this restriction is not proportionate, and would therefore be a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights."&lt;ref name="SupCourt"/&gt;

The sentence has raised a controversy all around the world, with disputes between those who see it as a victory for [[human rights]] and freedom from intolerance, and those who see it as an attack on [[freedom of religion|religious freedom]] and the right to [[freedom of speech|free speech]], which in themselves are both regarded as [[human right]]s.

Green became a cause celebre for [[Homophobia|anti-gay]] preacher [[Fred Phelps]], who has labelled anyone who held the belief that [[God]] could love non-elect [[sin]]ners as being eternally [[damnation|damned]]. Nonetheless, Phelps installed a monument praising Green on his website. (All of the other "monuments" to people on Phelps' sites actually express joy at the death of that person.) Phelps also launched a new website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godhatessweden.com God Hates Sweden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050105032032/http://www.godhatessweden.com/ |date=5 January 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (GodHatesSweden.com) partially in tribute to Green. Green subsequently denounced Phelps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=818&amp;date=20050107&lt;/ref&gt; "I think it is appalling that people say things like that," Green said, "it is extremely unpleasant." In response, Phelps and his organization, the [[Westboro Baptist Church]], denounced Green as a traitor and an ingrate, and he later removed the Green tribute from his website.

Åke Green was also supported by [[Ulf Ekman]] of [[Livets Ord]] and [[Robert Vesterlund]]'s ''[[Info-14]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Responding to the sentence, Sören Andersson, the president of [[Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Rights]] (RFSL), said that religious freedom could never be used as a reason to persecute people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelocal.se/2590/20051129/ Åke Green cleared over gay sermon&lt;/ref&gt;

== Temperance organisations==
In the beginning of 2008 the organisation [[IOGT-NTO]], a Swedish [[temperance movement|temperance]] movement, decided to withdraw Åke Green's membership, stating that his statements about homosexuality conflict with IOGT-NTO's bylaws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iogt.se/templates/NewsPageSmall____15743.aspx (Swedish) IOGT-NTO's decision to exclude Åke Green]&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, Green became an adherent of the Christian temperance movement, the [[Blue ribbon#Other symbols|Blue Ribbon]]. He was involved in another controversy following the announcement that he was to hold a speech at a common manifestation together with the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] on 1 May 2008, in [[Vänersborg]]. The Social Democrats excluded members of the Blue Ribbon, including Green, after several protests,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttela.se/?article=38461 (Swedish) "Åke Green no longer welcome", story published in local paper TTELA]&lt;/ref&gt; some of which were published in Vänersborgs local newspaper, ''TTELA''.
