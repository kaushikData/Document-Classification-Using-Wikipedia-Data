[[Image:African Cup of Nations 1962.png|thumb|Participating nations]]
The '''1962 African Cup of Nations''' was the third edition of the [[Africa Cup of Nations]], the [[soccer]] championship of Africa ([[Confederation of African Football|CAF]]). It was hosted by [[Ethiopia]]. Nine countries entered the competition, including the reigning champions [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]], meaning for the first time a qualification tournament was required. The finals only included four teams. Egypt, as holders, and [[Ethiopia national football team|Ethiopia]] as hosts, qualified automatically meaning each needed to play only one game to reach the final. Ethiopia won the tournament for the first time after [[extra time]] in the final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Thomas | first = Durosimi | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20016125 | title = New dawn for Ethiopia after Nations Cup qualification | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 2012-10-20 | accessdate = 2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tournament has the highest goals-per-game average in Africa Cup of Nations tournaments.

==Qualified teams==
{{Qualification for championships (CAF)}}
This page details the process of '''qualifying''' for the '''1962 African Cup of Nations'''. 9 African nations initially entered the competition.  Ethiopia and Egypt both automatically qualified as the host country and title holders respectively.  Morocco would withdraw before play began, thus leaving only 6 teams vying for the remaining two spots in the finals.

'''Aztec Bowl''' was a [[American football|football]] stadium (a [[Works Progress Administration]] project) on the [[San Diego State University]] campus in [[San Diego]], [[California]].

==History==
Aztec Bowl hosted the [[San Diego State University]] [[San Diego State Aztecs football|Aztecs]] [[College football|football]] team until they moved to [[Qualcomm Stadium]] in 1967. The stadium held 12,592 people at its peak and cost $500,000 to build. It was dedicated on October 3, 1936 before 7,500 people, after being completed earlier that year.

The stadium was initially supposed to be expanded to 45,000 seats but was expanded only once, to 5,000 seats in 1948.

==Current use==
Currently [[Viejas Arena]] (formerly Cox Arena), the school's basketball arena, sits on the site of the stadium.

==National Register of Historic Places==
Aztec Bowl is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]:&lt;ref name="histbldgs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dometest.sdsu.edu/projects/buildings/bldgs.html|title=Historic Buildings of San Diego State University|work=Infodome - SDSU Historic Buildings|publisher=San Diego State University|accessdate=2009-07-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906094946/http://dometest.sdsu.edu/projects/buildings/bldgs.html|archive-date=2006-09-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old concrete bleachers of the football stadium were not demolished when the new arena was built.

In commemoration, the arena was built on top of the steps from which people listened to President Kennedy. The bleachers can be clearly seen from the arena's parking lot on the outside and in the storage areas under the arena seats on the inside of the arena.

There has been a request to remove the stadium from the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref name = weekly&gt;{{Cite web | title = Pending (Not Yet Acted Upon) List  | work = | publisher = [[National Park Service]] | date    =April 21, 2012  | url = http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/pending/P20120421.htm  | accessdate = 27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Battle of the Sexes''''' is a 2017 [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[sports film]] directed by [[Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris]] and written by [[Simon Beaufoy]]. The plot is loosely based on the [[Battle of the Sexes (tennis)#1973: Riggs v King|1973 tennis match]] between [[Billie Jean King]] and [[Bobby Riggs]]. The film stars [[Emma Stone]] and [[Steve Carell]] as King and Riggs, with [[Andrea Riseborough]], [[Elisabeth Shue]], [[Austin Stowell]], [[Bill Pullman]], [[Natalie Morales (actress)|Natalie Morales]], and [[Sarah Silverman]] in supporting roles.

The film had its premiere at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on September 2, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] on September 22, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/08/london-film-festival-battle-of-the-sexes-gala-european-premiere-emma-stone-billie-jean-king-1202149086/|title=London Film Festival To Serve ‘Battle Of The Sexes’ In Gala European Premiere|last=Tartaglione|first=Nancy|date=2017-08-15|work=Deadline|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received positive reviews from critics, who praised the performances of Stone and Carell and the direction, with some calling it the best performance of Stone's career. Despite the positive reviews, the film was a box office disappointment, grossing $18.4 million against a $25 million budget. 

At the [[75th Golden Globe Awards]], Stone and Carell received nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/golden-globe-nominations-2018-nominees-full-list-1202634435/|title=Golden Globe Nominations: Complete List|work=Variety|date=December 11, 2017|accessdate=December 11, 2017|first=Rebecca|last=Rubin}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[24th Screen Actors Guild Awards]], both received [[Critics Choice Awards]] nominations in the categories [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in a Comedy|Best Actress in a Comedy]] and [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actor in a Comedy|Best Actor in a Comedy]]. Carell also received a nomination for [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role|Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role]].

==Plot==
The film dramatizes the events leading up to the September 1973 match between [[Billie Jean King]] and [[Bobby Riggs]], and their personal lives.

In 1970, King and [[Gladys Heldman]] confront [[Jack Kramer]], who has organized a tennis tournament where the top prize for women is one-eighth of the men's prize, despite equal ticket sales. King and Heldman threaten to start their own tour but Kramer won't alter the terms, citing the inferiority of women's tennis. When Billie Jean, [[Julie Heldman]], [[Valerie Ziegenfuss]], [[Judy Dalton]], [[Kristy Pigeon]], [[Peaches Bartkowicz]], [[Kerry Melville Reid]], [[Nancy Richey]], and [[Rosie Casals]] sign on as the “Original 9” players of what becomes the [[Virginia Slims Circuit]], Kramer bans them from tournaments organized by the [[United States Tennis Association|US Lawn Tennis Association]].

While the women's tour struggles during its early days, Billie Jean begins an affair with Marilyn Barnett, her hairdresser, threatening her marriage to [[Larry King (tennis)|Larry King]]. Meanwhile, Riggs' marriage to the [[United Cigar Stores|wealthy Priscilla (Whelan) Riggs]] is in trouble because of his addiction to gambling. Thrown out of his house when he can't conceal a Rolls Royce he won in a tennis bet, he hits upon the idea of a challenge match against the top woman player, boasting that even at age 55 he can beat any woman.

The women's tour has slowly gained a stronger foothold, with the [[Women's Tennis Association]] formed in 1973. Riggs continues to pressure King to play him. Eventually, Riggs persuades [[Margaret Court]], who recently overtook King to gain the [[World number 1 ranked female tennis players|World No. 1 ranking]], to play a match in May 1973. Riggs [[Battle of the Sexes (tennis)#1973: Riggs vs. Court|easily defeats Court]] and King decides she has to accept his challenge, but demands a final say as to the arrangements. King trains intensely, while Riggs relaxes. King objects to Kramer as a game announcer, threatening to not play unless he withdraws, which he does. After a slow start, King wins the match and Riggs reunites with his wife.

Originally built for [[High school football in North America|high school football]] and [[baseball]], in 1969 it became the home of the [[Eugene Emeralds]] [[Minor league baseball|minor league]] baseball team, which previously played at the privately owned Bethel Park (north of Roosevelt Boulevard  ({{coordinates|44.0644|-123.1454}}); its outfield is present-day Lark Park).&lt;ref name=bbnnfc/&gt;&lt;ref name=stbbbbpk&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FqtVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IuEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5691%2C5849882|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |location=Oregon |title=State buys Bethel baseball park |date=October 24, 1969 |page=15A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dpplyble&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Y05WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6esDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4476%2C6918581 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |location=Oregon |last=Clark |first=Bob |title=Deep and playable: Bethel Park |date=June 29, 2004 |page=1D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cvcstad99&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yd1WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pusDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3961%2C141537 |newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard |location=Oregon |title=Civic Stadium |date=August 1, 1999 |page=1D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emeralds moved up to the [[Pacific Coast League]] ([[Triple-A (baseball)|AAA]]) in 1969 and needed a larger venue. After five seasons in the PCL, they returned to the Class A [[Northwest League]] in 1974 and played in the stadium through 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/team4/page.jsp?ymd=20100510&amp;content_id=9949000&amp;vkey=team4_t461&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;sid=t461 |title= Eugene Emeralds: History |accessdate= June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (High school football moved to the [[Oregon Ducks football|University of Oregon's]] [[Autzen Stadium]] in 1969, following the installation of [[artificial turf]].) Before the departure of the Emeralds in 2009, Civic Stadium was one of the ten oldest active minor league baseball facilities in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Edward |last= Russo |title= Civic Engineering: The Future of Eugene's Historic Stadium is at Issue — Again |date= August 19, 2013 |newspaper= [[The Register-Guard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lighted playing field at Civic Stadium had an unorthodox alignment, oriented southeast (home plate to center field);&lt;!--, resulting in difficult visual conditions for the fielders on the left side of the diamond for games played near sunset.{{citation needed|date= June 2015}}--&gt; the recommended alignment of a baseball diamond is east-northeast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf |publisher=Major League Baseball |title=Playing Field Orientation – Rule 1.04 |accessdate=June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emeralds relocate==
In August 2009, the Emeralds announced their relocation to the [[University of Oregon]]'s [[PK Park]] for the 2010 season. The Emeralds cited Civic Stadium's need of substantial renovations, major problems with irrigation and electrical systems, as well as broken seats, and estimated that modernization could cost as much as $15 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Benjamin |last= Hill |title= Emeralds Pick PK for New Home |date= August 25, 2009 |publisher=Eugene Emeralds |url= http://eugene.emeralds.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090825&amp;content_id=6610654&amp;vkey=news_milb&amp;fext=.jsp |accessdate= June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emeralds played their last game at Civic Stadium on Thursday, September 4, 2009, a 5-3 loss to the [[Salem-Keizer Volcanoes]]. Following the game, fans collected pieces of the outfield turf as souvenirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Dan |last= Morrison |title= Ems Play Final Game at Civic Stadium |date= September 4, 2009 |publisher= [[KVAL-TV|KVAL]] |url= http://www.kval.com/news/local/57318612.html |accessdate= June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disuse and destruction==

By 2009, the school district designated the stadium a surplus property, although the district had not made a decision on whether to sell it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Arrianee |last= LeBeau |title= What Does the Future Hold for Civic Stadium? |date= September 2, 2009 |publisher= [[KVAL-TV|KVAL]] |url= http://www.kval.com/news/local/56839787.html |accessdate= June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As recently as 2007, the school district examined options to redevelop all or part of the property, most likely as medium-density residential units.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |publisher= School District 4J |title= Board of Directors Meeting Minutes |accessdate= June 29, 2015 |date= December 12, 2007 |url= http://www.4j.lane.edu/files/board/reports/4J_BOD_report_2007-12-12.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local group, Friends of Civic Stadium, started a [[grassroots]] campaign in support of restoring the historic venue while also attempting to find alternative tenants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.savecivicstadium.org |title=Save Civic Stadium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the future of the stadium in flux, it was one of ten entries on [[Restore Oregon]]'s [[Oregon's Most Endangered Places|Most Endangered Places in Oregon]] 2011 list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicpreservationleague.org/mep_CivicStadium.php |title=Most Endangered Places 2011: Civic Stadium |publisher=[[Restore Oregon]] |accessdate=June 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110165432/http://www.historicpreservationleague.org/mep_CivicStadium.php |archivedate=November 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, the Eugene Civic Alliance raised $4.1 million to buy the stadium and 10 acres of surrounding property from the school district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://registerguard.com/rg/news/local/32930735-75/kidsports-key-in-saving-eugenes-civic-stadium.html.csp |last= Russo |first= Edward |title= Civic Lesson in Eugene |newspaper = The Register-Guard |date= April 5, 2015 |accessdate= June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eugene Civic Alliance is a non-profit made up of community leaders, including [[Lane United FC]] managing director Dave Galas, and the executive director of the Eugene youth sports organization Kidsports, former Ducks basketball player [[Bev Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.laneunitedfc.com/blog/2015/3/civic-stadium |title= Civic Stadium: A Community Triumph of the Past, Present and future |publisher= Lane United FC |date= March 3, 2015 |accessdate= June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2015, Civic Stadium was destroyed by fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/historic-eugene-oregon-stadium-engulfed-flames-n384156 |title= Historic Civic Stadium in Eugene, Oregon Engulfed in Flames |publisher= NBC News |accessdate= June 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two days later, officials charged four pre-teen boys in connection with the fire, although the cause had not yet been determined conclusively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.katu.com/news/local/4-children-to-faces-charges-in-Civic-Stadium-fire-311341641.html |title= 4 Children to Face Charges in Civic Stadium Fire |publisher= [[KATU]] |accessdate= July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was delisted from the National Register of Historic Places on March 8, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = National Park Service  | title = Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 3/07/16 through 3/11/16 | date = March 18, 2016 | url = http://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20160318.htm | deadurl = no | accessdate = March 22, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160322030827/http://www.nps.gov/nr/listings/20160318.htm | archivedate = March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year long, moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program increased DHT and SHBG in sedentary men age 40–75, but had no effect on other androgens. Both DHT and SHBG increased 14% in exercisers at 3 months, and at 12 months they remained 9% above baseline. SHBG is protective against DHT as it binds free androgen.&lt;ref name="Hawkins"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hawkins VN, Foster-Schubert K, Chubak J, Sorensen B, Ulrich CM, Stancyzk FZ, Plymate S, Stanford J, White E, Potter JD, McTiernan A | title = Effect of Exercise on Serum Sex Hormones in Men | journal = Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 223–233 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18202581 | pmc = 3040039 | doi = 10.1249/mss.0b013e31815bbba9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In acute assessment of hormone levels in soccer players before, during and after a game, DHT and testosterone increased during the match, but returned to baseline after 45 minutes rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lupo C, Baldi L, Bonifazi M, Lodi L, Martelli G, Viti A, Carli G | title = Androgen levels following a football match | journal = European journal of applied physiology and occupational physiology | volume = 54 | issue = 5 | pages = 494–496 | year = 1985 | pmid = 4085477 | doi = 10.1007/bf00422958 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerobic exercise in Japanese rats done on a rodent treadmill doubled local concentrations of DHT in calf muscles as assessed by protein assay.&lt;ref name="fatrats"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sato K, Iemitsu M, Aizawa K, Mesaki N, Ajisaka R, Fujita S | title = DHEA administration and exercise training improves insulin resistance in obese rats | journal = Nutrition &amp; Metabolism | volume = 9 | pages = 47 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22647230 | pmc = 3433349 | doi = 10.1186/1743-7075-9-47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After intense aerobic effort, high endurance athletes were also found to have lower free testosterone the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Daly W, Seegers CA, Rubin DA, Dobridge JD, Hackney AC | title = Relationship between stress hormones and testosterone with prolonged endurance exercise | journal = European Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 375–380 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15618989 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s00421-004-1223-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In prolonged endurance exercise, such as a marathon, levels ultimately decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dressendorfer RH, Wade CE | title = Effects of a 15-d race on plasma steroid levels and leg muscle fitness in runners | journal = Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise | volume = 23 | issue = 8 | pages = 954–958 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1956271 | doi=10.1249/00005768-199108000-00012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, DHT drops, while adrenal androgen and cortisol will increase with the stress response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Morville R, Pesquies PC, Guezennec CY, Serrurier BD, Guignard M | title = Plasma variations in testicular and adrenal androgens during prolonged physical exercise in man | journal = Annales d'endocrinologie | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 501–510 | year = 1979 | pmid = 518032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anaerobic==
[[File:TwoDumbbells.JPG|thumb|right|Effects of anaerobic exercise also vary with length of time.]]
It is unknown if anaerobic training changes individual hormone profiles, or if conditioned athletes in studies self-selected because of physiologic predisposition to athletic conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bunt JC | title = Hormonal alterations due to exercise | journal = Sports Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 331–345 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3529282 | doi = 10.2165/00007256-198603050-00003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is variation of response to anaerobic stress depending on exercise intensity, age, gender, length of time studied, and time at which serum indices were drawn. Most studies report that testosterone increases or is unchanged acutely, though some even report it to decrease. Anaerobic exercisers have testosterone levels below sedentary controls in cross sectional analysis. Over months to years, levels are stable to slightly increased.

The [[Testosterone-cortisol ratio|ratio of testosterone to cortisol]] can both increase&lt;ref name="Scand2"/&gt; and decrease&lt;ref name="Scand1"/&gt; during resistance training, depending on intensity of exercise. A study comparing young and old subjects showed acute ''increases'' in GH and testosterone for both, although the latter increased less in older men.&lt;ref name="Hakk98"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Häkkinen K, Pakarinen A, Newton RU, Kraemer WJ | title = Acute hormone responses to heavy resistance lower and upper extremity exercise in young versus old men | journal = European journal of applied physiology and occupational physiology | volume = 77 | issue = 4 | pages = 312–319 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9562359 | doi = 10.1007/s004210050339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Testosterone rises in late hours of sleep after anaerobic exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McMurray RG, Eubank TK, Hackney AC | title = Nocturnal hormonal responses to resistance exercise | journal = European journal of applied physiology and occupational physiology | volume = 72 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 121–126 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8789582 | doi = 10.1007/bf00964126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Androgen receptor expression increases with acute exercise in correlation to free testosterone.&lt;ref name="Willow"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Willoughby DS, Taylor L | title = Effects of sequential bouts of resistance exercise on androgen receptor expression | journal = Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise | volume = 36 | issue = 9 | pages = 1499–1506 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15354030 | doi = 10.1249/01.mss.0000139795.83030.d1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When comparing men and women in the 30, 50 and 70 year age groups, young and middle aged men showed increased testosterone after exercise, with the latter also having increased cortisol.

Interval and quality of exercise also affect hormonal response. Sessions of moderate to high intensity with multiple sets and short time intervals, during which energy is derived from glycolytic lactate metabolism, appear to be the greatest stimulus for steroid hormone response. Hormonal response in young men varies with the number of sets in the exercise session. However, when the number increased from 4 to 6, anabolic levels stabilized and cortisol continued to rise, suggesting that alterations in anaerobic volume could alter anabolic and catabolic hormonal balance.&lt;ref name="Smil2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smilios I, Pilianidis T, Karamouzis M, Tokmakidis SP | title = Hormonal Responses after Various Resistance Exercise Protocols | journal = Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 644–654 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12673149 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1249/01.MSS.0000058366.04460.5F }}&lt;/ref&gt; When sets are performed at maximum repetitions, interval has no influence at a certain intensity range, with no acute hormone response difference between protocols at 10 maximum reps with 2- and 5-minute intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ahtiainen JP, Pakarinen A, Alen M, Kraemer WJ, Häkkinen K | title = Short vs. Long Rest Period Between the Sets in Hypertrophic Resistance Training: Influence on Muscle Strength, Size, and Hormonal Adaptations in Trained Men | journal = The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 572–582 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16095405 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1519/15604.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a higher total testosterone response in hypertrophy protocols compared to those for strength and power, despite equalization of total work load (defined as load x sets x repetitions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McCaulley GO, McBride JM, Cormie P, Hudson MB, Nuzzo JL, Quindry JC, Travis Triplett N | title = Acute hormonal and neuromuscular responses to hypertrophy, strength and power type resistance exercise | journal = European Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 105 | issue = 5 | pages = 695–704 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19066934 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s00421-008-0951-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a 27% greater testosterone response using protocols with simultaneous use of all four limbs.

A number of studies have looked at effects of anaerobic exercise over months to years, showing it to be constant or slightly increased. A small case-control of anaerobic training in young untrained males over six weeks found decline in free testosterone of 17 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ara I, Perez-Gomez J, Vicente-Rodriguez G, Chavarren J, Dorado C, Calbet JA | title = Serum free testosterone, leptin and soluble leptin receptor changes in a 6-week strength-training programme | journal = The British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 96 | issue = 6 | pages = 1053–1059 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17181880 | doi = 10.1017/bjn20061956 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With men in their 60s, resistive training over 16 weeks did not affect baseline anabolic hormone levels, although GH increased acutely with exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nicklas BJ, Ryan AJ, Treuth MM, Harman SM, Blackman MR, Hurley BF, Rogers MA | title = Testosterone, Growth Hormone and IGF-I Responses to Acute and Chronic Resistive Exercise in Men Aged 55-70 Years | journal = International Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 7 | pages = 445–450 | year = 2007 | pmid = 8550252 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1055/s-2007-973035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study over 21 weeks in male strength athletes showed basal hormone levels to be constant, despite strength increase.&lt;ref name="Aht"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ahtiainen JP, Pakarinen A, Alen M, Kraemer WJ, Häkkinen K | title = Muscle hypertrophy, hormonal adaptations and strength development during strength training in strength-trained and untrained men | journal = European Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 89 | issue = 6 | pages = 555–563 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12734759 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s00421-003-0833-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow up study looked at a larger group of weight trainers over 24 weeks, with 12-week decompensation. Training caused no change in total testosterone, but there were decreases in free testosterone, [[progesterone]], [[androstendione]], [[DHEA]], cortisol, [[transcortin]], and in the [[Cortisol binding globulin|cortisol:CBG]] ratio, suggesting androgen turnover increased with training intensity, without change in total testosterone.&lt;ref name="Scand2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alén M, Pakarinen A, Häkkinen K, Komi PV | title = Responses of serum androgenic-anabolic and catabolic hormones to prolonged strength training | journal = International journal of sports medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 229–233 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3410630 | doi=10.1055/s-2007-1025011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study looking at young men and resistance training over 48 weeks found increases in baseline serum testosterone from 20 ± 5 to 25 ± 5 nmol/l, and an increase in testosterone:SHBG ratio, LH and FSH.&lt;ref name="2 year"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Häkkinen K, Pakarinen A, Alen M, Kauhanen H, Komi PV | title = Neuromuscular and hormonal adaptations in athletes to strength training in two years | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 65 | issue = 6 | pages = 2406–2412 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3215840 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combined training==
One study showed [[Growth hormone|GH]] increase with anaerobic effort to be blunted in those who performed aerobic training for 60 minutes prior to strength training.

The '''Father David Bauer Olympic Arena''' is an [[ice hockey]] arena in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Canada. It seats about 1,750 for hockey with a standing room capacity of over 2,000. It is named after [[David Bauer (ice hockey)|Father David Bauer]], a [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]r and hockey pioneer.

Canada's defunct national touring team, the brainchild of Bauer, also staged tryouts there. The arena was built in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calgary.ca/CSPS/Recreation/Pages/Arenas/Father-David-Bauer-and-Norma-Bush.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena uses the {{convert|200|by|100|ft|m}} (or [[Olympics|Olympic]]) sized ice surface. A second arena, the ''Norma Bush Arena'' is attached to the facility, and has a {{convert|185|by|85|ft|m}} artificial ice surface.&lt;ref name=city&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.calgary.ca/CSPS/Recreation/Pages/Arenas/Father-David-Bauer-and-Norma-Bush.aspx | title=  Father David Bauer / Norma Bush Arenas | author= City of Calgary |date=February 2007 | accessdate = 2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena is the home of the [[Calgary Mustangs]] of the [[Alberta Junior Hockey League]] and the [[Calgary Dinos]] university hockey team.  It is also the home of the [[Western Hockey League]] major junior circuit, the ''AAA Midget Flames'' of the [[Alberta Midget Hockey League]] and is often used as the training facility for the Canadian Olympic and junior national teams.&lt;ref name=city/&gt;

FDB also hosts games for the annual [[Mac's AAA midget hockey tournament]].

The arena was used for a few [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|ice hockey]] games at the [[ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988 Winter Olympics]] as well as the compulsory figures section of the men's and women's figure skating competitions .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1988/orw1988pt1.pdf 1988 Winter Olympics.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114080921/http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1988/orw1988pt1.pdf |date=January 14, 2011 }} Part 1. pp. 186-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena is located in the same complex as [[McMahon Stadium]] and [[Foothills Stadium]], adjacent to the [[University of Calgary]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1635">'''Footballer's Ankle''' is a pinching or impingement of the ligaments or tendons of the ankle between the bones, particularly the [[talus bone|talus]] and [[tibia]]. This results in pain, inflammation and swelling.

== Causes ==
A common cause of anterior impingement is a bone spur on anklebone ([[talus bone|talus]]) or the shinbone ([[tibia]]). Repeated kicking actions can cause the anklebone to hit the bottom of the shinbone, which can lead to a lump of bone (or [[bone spur]]) developing. This bone spur may then begin to impact on the soft tissue at the front of the ankle, causing [[inflammation]] and swelling. The condition is most common in athletes who repeatedly bend the ankle upward ([[dorsiflexion]]), such as footballers, hence the name.

== Symptoms ==
- pain and tenderness over anterior ankle joint&lt;br /&gt;
- pain on dorsiflexion and plantar flexion&lt;br /&gt;
- band of pain across anterior ankle when kicking a ball&lt;br /&gt;
- palpable bony lump on distal tibia or superior talus

== Treatment ==
- [[soft tissue technique]]s to stretch muscles crossing the ankle to relieve tension&lt;br /&gt;
- mobilisation of ankle joint&lt;br /&gt;
- steroid injection to reduce inflammation&lt;br /&gt;
- surgery to remove bony spurs

'''Hastings Racecourse''' is a [[horse racing]] facility at [[Hastings Park]] four miles from downtown [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. Originally called East Park, it opened for business in 1889, making it Vancouver’s longest continuously used professional sports facility. The racing operation is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Great Canadian Gaming]] Corporation who acquired the lease of the city-owned track in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/20/sports/canadian-racetrack-home-to-derby-winning-jockey-struggling-for-survival.html |title=Winning Jockey Came From a Struggling Track |date=May 19, 2012 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |author=Bob Mackin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The track was originally known as Exhibition Park Race Track &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://searcharchives.vancouver.ca/horse-racing-at-exhibition-park-race-track |title=Horse Racing at Exhibition Park Race Track |publisher=City of Vancouver Archives Item : CVA 180-3864 |date=1972-00-00 |accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has always been referred to by the public and the media as Exhibition Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/m/bower+collection+support+jockeys+hastings+racecourse/10077179/story.html |title=Bower collection to support jockeys at Hastings Racecourse |publisher=Vancouver Sun |date=2014-07-30 |accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; July 1, 1939, marked the first time [[Thoroughbred racing]] used an electric [[starting gate]], the invention of [[Texas|Texan]] [[Clay Puett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://drf.uky.edu/catalog/1930s/drf1939071401/drf1939071401_21_10 |title=Clay Puett Gate Makes Hit: New Starting Device, Closed Fore and Aft, Works to Perfection at Canadian |publisher=Daily Racing Form at University of Kentucky Archives |date=1939-07-14|accessdate=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first Monday in August, a public holiday, the track hosts BC Cup Day that features a series of six races for top [[Thoroughbred]]s in various classes. In September, the two most important races for three-year-olds in British Columbia, the [[British Columbia Oaks]] and the [[British Columbia Derby]], are run at Hastings Racecourse. Major races include:

'''[[Graded stakes race|Grade 3]]:'''
* [[Lieutenant Governors Stakes]]
* [[British Columbia Derby]]
* [[British Columbia Premier's Handicap]] 
* Ballerina Stakes

'''Ungraded stakes:'''
* [[British Columbia Oaks]]
* [[Fantasy Stakes (Canada)|Fantasy Stakes]]
* [[Ascot Graduation Stakes]]

On May 18, 2011 it was reported that the course could close at the end of its 2012 lease due to low profits from wagering revenue and slots as well as difficulty reaching an agreeable new lease with the city. A decision by Great Canadian had to be made by October 31 of that year.&lt;ref name=am&gt;[http://www.news1130.com/news/local/article/199670--hastings-racecourse-could-close Hastings Racecourse could close - News1130]&lt;/ref&gt; The result of those negotiations was that the track remain open and running.

In 2012, Hastings Racecourse made international headlines when little-known Mexican-born jockey [[Mario Gutierrez (jockey)|Mario Gutierrez]] (who had emigrated to Canada in 2006 and begun riding at Hastings, winning the track's riding titles in 2007 and 2008), won the [[Santa Anita Derby]], the [[Kentucky Derby]] and the [[Preakness Stakes]] aboard [[I'll Have Another]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vancouversun.com/sports/Hastings+star+jockey+ready+roses+Kentucky+Derby/6555655/story.html |title=Mario Gutierrez takes unlikely path from poverty to Kentucky Derby win via east Vancouver racecourse |date=May 5, 2012 |publisher=[[Vancouver Sun]] |author=Yvonne Zacharias}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vancouversun.com/sports/Mario+Gutierrez+Have+Another+wins+137th+Preakness+Stakes/6650633/story.htmll |title=Mario Gutierrez, I’ll Have Another wins 137th Preakness Stakes |date=May 19, 2012 |publisher=[[Vancouver Sun]] |author=Cam Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hong Kong Derby''' is a [[Hong Kong]] [[Thoroughbred horse race]] held annually since 1873. Restricted to horses four-years-old only since 1981, the race is run in mid-March and is the premier event on the domestic racing programme with a purse of HK$18 million (app. US$2.3 million).

The first Hong Kong Derby was raced at [[Happy Valley Racecourse]] but in 1979 was transferred permanently to its present location at [[Sha Tin Racecourse]].

Since 1981, the Derby has been won by several horses who went on to earn [[Hong Kong Horse of the Year]] honors including Football, Co-Tack, Yuno When and River Verdon. In 2003, Elegant Fashion became the first filly to win the Derby since 1976.

From 2004 to 2012, the race was sponsored by [[Mercedes-Benz]].  It is sponsored by BMW since 2013.

==Race distance==
The racing distance of the Hong Kong Derby has varied over the years.  From 2000 to present, the distance has been 2000 metres, with the starting point in front of the Sha Tin grandstand. From 1977 to 1999, the race was held over 1800m.  From 1973 to 1976, the distance was 2230m.  From 1967 to 1972, the distance was "From The Two Mile Post Once Round &amp; In" (1 mile 171 yards.) From 1963 to 1966, the distance was 1 1/4 mile.  In 1961 &amp; 1962, the distance was "From the Half Mile Post Once Round &amp; In" (1 mile 3 furlongs 65 yards.) From 1947 to 1960, the distance was 1 1/2 mile.

''' Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium''' (colloquially known as simply '''Husky Stadium''') is an outdoor [[American football|football]] [[stadium]] in the [[Pacific Northwest|northwest]] [[United States]], located on the campus of the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

It has been the home of the [[Washington Huskies]] of the [[Pac-12 Conference]] since 1920, hosting its [[Washington Huskies football|football]] games. The university also holds its annual commencement at the stadium in June. It is located at the southeastern corner of campus, between Montlake Boulevard N.E. and [[Union Bay (Seattle)|Union Bay]], just north of the [[Montlake Cut]]. The stadium is served by the [[University of Washington station|University of Washington]] [[Link light rail]] station, as well as several bus routes.

The stadium underwent a $280 million renovation that was completed in [[2013 Washington Huskies football team|2013]].&lt;ref name="Jude" /&gt; Its U-shaped design was specifically oriented (18.167° south of due east) to minimize glare from the early afternoon sun in the athletes' eyes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://gohuskies.cstv.com/facilities/husky-stadium.html University of Washington – Official Athletic Site: Facilities]&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium's open end overlooks scenic [[Lake Washington]] and the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]], including [[Mount Rainier]]. Prior to the 2013 renovation, its total capacity of 72,500 made it the largest stadium in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[List of NCAA Division I FBS football stadiums|one of the largest]] stadiums in college football.

==History==
The original stadium was built {{Time ago|1920}} in 1920&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Condotta|first=Bob|title=Will tickets to new Husky Stadium cost a lot more?|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/huskies/2015876084_uwfb11.html|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Puget Sound Bridge and Dredging Company]] with a [[seating capacity]] of 30,000. It replaced [[Denny Field (Washington)|Denny Field]], located at the north end of campus, south of NE 45th St. and 20th Ave NE.  Husky Stadium's first game was the concluding game of the [[1920 Washington Sun Dodgers football team|1920]] season, a 28–7 loss to [[1920 Dartmouth Indians football team|Dartmouth]] on November 27.

In the summer of 1923, the stadium was the site of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Warren Harding]]'s final public address on July 27,&lt;ref name=erg23&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFxXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_u8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6860%2C4930474 |work=Eugene Daily Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=United Press |title=President is set against exploitation |last=Martin |first=Lawrence |date=July 28, 1923 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; less than a week before his unexpected death in [[San Francisco]].

The capacity of the lower bowl was expanded with the addition of 10,000 seats around the rim in 1936, and a few thousand more in 1968. The first of the stadium's iconic covered grandstands was constructed in [[1950 Washington Huskies football team|1950]], adding 15,000 seats to the south side.&lt;ref name="hs50add"&gt;{{cite news |title=Seattle History: The first time Husky Stadium came down |url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/thebigblog/2011/12/22/seattle-history-the-first-time-husky-stadium-came-down/#2238-1|newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=December 22, 2011 |accessdate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aerial Husky Stadium November 2011 - 1.jpg|thumb|left|An aerial view of Husky Stadium as seen the day before the start of the 2011 renovation project.&lt;br&gt;"Go Huskies" and the "W" logo were painted on the&lt;br&gt;north and south decks in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gohuskies.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/090608aal.html Washington-BYU Postgame Notes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222040534/http://www.gohuskies.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/090608aal.html |date=2012-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[1987 Washington Huskies football team|1987]], 13,000 seats were added with the construction of the north grandstand.&lt;ref name=hs8504&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kGpfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3S4MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4061%2C1449046|newspaper=[[Lewiston Morning Tribune]]|agency=Associated Press|title=UW Regents Approve Plans for Husky Stadium Addition|date=April 20, 1985|page=2C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the south stand, this structure included a cantilevered steel roof covering a portion of the lower seats. The project made headlines on February 25, 1987, when the grandstand collapsed during construction as a result of miscommunication between the workers and the contractor, which lead to the premature removal during the intended replacement of several support cables.&lt;ref name="Manno"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manno|first1=Dominic|title=University of Washington Football Stadium Addition Collapse (1987)|url=https://failures.wikispaces.com/University+of+Washington+Football+Stadium+(Manno)|website=failures.wikispaces.com|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there were no casualties, property damage ranged from $500,000 to $1,000,000 and resulted in setbacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=2947 HistoryLink Essay: Husky Stadium collapses on February 25, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hs8702&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Y1xWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CPADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3711%2C4515435|newspaper=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|location=Spokane|title=Section of Husky Stadium Collapses|date=February 26, 1987|page=A-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Husky Stadium was a primary venue for the [[1990 Goodwill Games]], where the crowd saw an address by former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]], as well as an address by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and a performance by the [[Moody Blues]] &amp; [[Gorky Park (band)|Gorky Park]]. The stadium hosted the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as the track &amp; field competition.

Husky Stadium was the temporary home of the [[Seattle Seahawks]] for five games (two preseason and three regular season) in [[1994 NFL season|1994]] while the [[Kingdome]] was temporarily closed for repairs to its damaged roof. After the demolition of the Kingdome in March 2000, the Seahawks played at Husky Stadium for the [[2000 Seattle Seahawks season|2000]] and [[2001 Seattle Seahawks season|2001]] seasons before moving into Seahawks Stadium (now [[CenturyLink Field]]) in [[2002 Seattle Seahawks season|2002]].

The playing field at Husky Stadium was originally dirt, which was then replaced with natural grass in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/huskies/333325_stadium27.html|title=Husky Stadium Aging Not So Gracefully|newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]}} {{Dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1968 Washington Huskies football team|1968]], Washington became one of the first major college teams to play on [[AstroTurf]] at home; at the time, the [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] [[Astrodome]] and [[Neyland Stadium]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] were the only major facilities to use the surface. The AstroTurf field was replaced in [[1972 in sports|1972]], [[1977 Washington Huskies football team|1977]], [[1987 Washington Huskies football team|1987]], and [[1995 Washington Huskies football team|1995]].&lt;ref name="Linde"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Linde|first1=Richard|title=From rocks to turf: "'Did you ever see a field grow rocks?'"|url=http://www.4malamute.com/stadium2.html|website=4malamute.com|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[FieldTurf]], a new variation of synthetic turf, was installed in [[2000 Washington Huskies football team|2000]] at a cost of $1,074,958. The new turf features enhanced drainage and reduced abrasion through the use of synthetic fibers that are tufted into an infill of sand and rubber. The project was funded by [[Seattle Seahawks]] owner [[Paul Allen]], who used Husky Stadium as a temporary home venue during the construction of [[CenturyLink Field]]. The first of its kind in the NFL, the surface was so popular with the players that the Seahawks, who had planned to use natural grass at their new stadium, instead installed their own FieldTurf surface.&lt;ref name="fieldturf.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=PAUL ALLEN PAYS FOR NEW TURF AT HUSKY STADIUM|url=http://www.fieldturf.com/fr/artificial-turf/artificial-turf-news/paul-allen-pays-for-new-turf-at-husky-stadium|website=fieldturf.com|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FieldTurf at Husky Stadium was replaced with a newer one after nine seasons in 2009 at a cost of $350,000.&lt;ref name="Pac-12 Conference"&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington To Replace Husky Stadium Playing Surface|url=http://pac-12.com/article/2009/04/17/washington-replace-husky-stadium-playing-surface|website=pac-12.com|accessdate=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seattle - Husky Stadium under construction - 1920.jpg|frame|center|Husky Stadium under construction in 1920 in front of [[Union Bay (Seattle, Washington)|Union Bay]]]]

In addition to the new playing surface, the Seahawks made other improvements to Husky stadium in preparation for its tenure as an NFL venue for two seasons. A larger scoreboard debuted in 1998, with a {{convert|23|x|42|ft|adj=on}} "HuskyTron" video screen.  Improved lighting for television, including corner lights, was added in 1999, and official [[National Football League|NFL]] goalposts (optic yellow, {{convert|40|ft|1|abbr=on}} in height) were installed in 2000.

The Husky Stadium end zones were painted gold during the 1980s and early 1990s; the new AstroTurf in [[1995 Washington Huskies football team|1995]] changed them to purple. They became natural green with the installation of FieldTurf in [[2000 Washington Huskies football team|2000]], which lasted until 2009 when they reverted to gold for one season. Purple end zones returned prior the [[2010 Washington Huskies football team|2010]] season, and were temporarily painted black for the Huskies' first "blackout" game against [[2010 UCLA Bruins football team|UCLA]] on November 18.

On September 3, 2015, [[Alaska Airlines]] purchased naming rights to the field, which changed the official name to "Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium." The agreement, in which the university will receive $41 million over 10 years, became the largest of its kind in college athletics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/uw-husky-football/uw-alaska-airlines-agree-to-naming-rights-deal-for-husky-stadium/|work=Seattle Times|title=UW, Alaska Airlines agree to naming-rights deal for Husky Stadium’s field|date=September 3, 2015|accessdate=October 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Wave===
{{See also|Wave (audience)}}
[[File:2009-0919-HuskyStadium.jpg|thumb|240px|Pre-renovation in 2009, looking south;&lt;br&gt;Downtown and [[Space Needle]] at top right]]
Many claim that the first [[audience wave]] originated in Husky Stadium on [[Halloween]] 1981, at the prompting of Husky band trumpeter Dave Hunter.&lt;ref name="espn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/playbook/fandom/post/_/id/18888/its-settled-where-the-wave-first-started |title=It's settled: Where The Wave first started |publisher=Espn.com |date=2013-03-01 |accessdate=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daven Hiskey |url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2014/07/wave-started/ |title=Who Invented the Sporting Wave? |publisher=Todayifoundout.com |date=2014-07-15 |accessdate=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to Hunter's account, former Washington yell leader [[Robb Weller]] has also claimed credit for the first wave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washington.edu/news/archive/uweek/awards2008/42265 |title=Best and Brightest 2008 &amp;#124; University of Washington Recognition Award Recipients |publisher=Washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2002/aug/29/who-started-wave/ |title=Who started the wave? |publisher=San Diego Reader |date=2002-08-29 |accessdate=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weller was the guest yell-king during the Huskies' homecoming football game against [[1981 Stanford Cardinal football team|Stanford]]. His initial concept for the wave was for it to travel vertically, from the bottom of the stands to the top, within the Husky student section.&lt;ref name="espn" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=caple/wave/061027 |title=ESPN.com: Page 2 : Please, don't blame me for this |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=1981-10-15 |accessdate=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the stunt was met with limited interest, he then decided to reverse the movement of the wave to travel from top to bottom. This failed miserably, as it was necessary to turn backward to see the wave progressing downward. Weller then gave up and returned his attention to the game. However, a fan named Omar Parker sitting on the open (east) end of the stadium at the student side started yelling "sideways". Weller did not hear him, but then many students tried to initiate a "sideways" wave on their own. After a few attempts, and more yelling of "sideways" by students, Weller took notice. He instructed the crowd to stand as he ran past. He moved along the track toward the open end of the stadium, explaining to the student crowd what he would do, then ran along the track toward the closed end of the stadium, in front of the student section. The stunt caught on after a couple of tries and continued around the entire stadium, and was then repeated throughout the rest of the game and the season. Longtime UW band director Bill Bissell also claimed co-creator credit with Weller, suggesting that the wave was devised by both of them prior to the game. The following week Bill Scott (known as "Bill the Beer Man") started the wave in Husky Stadium and also at the [[Seattle Seahawks]] game in the Kingdome.

===Loudest Stadium in College Football===
[[File:Apple Cup Crowd 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Capacity crowd in the south stands&lt;br&gt;at the 100th [[Apple Cup]] in 2007]]

Husky Stadium has long been recognized as one of the loudest stadiums in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Ted|title=Getting to know the new Husky Stadium |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/pac10/post/_/id/24135/getting-to-know-the-new-husky-stadium|newspaper=ESPN|date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is in part due to the stadium's design; almost 70% of the seats are located between the end zones, covered by cantilevered metal roofs that trap the sound.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gohuskies.cstv.com/facilities/wash-husky-stadium.html Husky Stadium listing] at official Huskies athletic site&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, the high decibel levels typical of Husky games, in addition to fans stomping their feet in the bleachers, causes television cameras to shake. During the [[1992 Washington Huskies football team|1992 night game]] against the [[1992 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska Cornhuskers]], [[ESPN]] measured the noise level at over 130 [[decibels]], well above the [[threshold of pain]]. The maximum recorded level of 133.6 decibels, according to ESPN, is the highest ever recorded for a college football stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwE2LyzOvqc|title=Loudest College Football Stadium?|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tailgating===
Husky Stadium is unusual in that fans can travel to football games by boat, known locally as "sailgating" (other stadiums with this feature include [[Neyland Stadium]] at [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]], [[Heinz Field]] at [[Pittsburgh]], and [[McLane Stadium]] at [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor]]). There can be upwards of 12,000 people out on Lake Washington next to Husky Stadium during game days.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://stats.washingtonpost.com/cfb/story.asp?i=20071010155457251988104 Tim Booth AP Sports Writer]&lt;/ref&gt; Before kickoff, the Washington crew team offers shuttles to anyone that wants to go to and from the boats and docks for the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idahostatesman.com/boisestatefootball/story/151085.html IdahoStatesman.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The north and south parking lots are packed with cars for [[tailgate party|tailgating]]. There is currently controversy surrounding the south parking lot because the Pacific Interchange Option for expansion to the [[Evergreen Point Floating Bridge (2016)|SR 520 Floating Bridge]] would effectively eliminate the south parking lot for tailgating.

Fans also gather at the Dempsey Indoor Facility just north of the stadium for Husky Huddles. After the game, the Tyee Sports Council and the University of Washington Athletic Department put on events where fans can gather and hear analysis of the game from Washington coaches and Husky Legends, and listen to the Husky Marching Band.

===2011–2013 renovation===
[[File:Aerial Husky Stadium April 6 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Renovation in April 2012]]

Husky Stadium had developed numerous structural problems over the years as a result of standing for nine decades in Seattle's moist weather, particularly in the lower bowl. In November 2011, Husky Stadium began a $261 million renovation,&lt;ref name=CondottaNewHusky /&gt; the largest single capital project in the history of the University of Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thiel |first=Art |title=Thiel: UW Stadium Funding Near Goal Line|url=http://sportspressnw.com/2110589/2011/thiel-uw-stadium-funding-nearing-goal-line|newspaper=Sports Press Northwest|date=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Home games were played at [[CenturyLink Field]] during the [[2012 Washington Huskies football team|2012]] season while construction took place.&lt;ref name=CondottaNewHusky&gt;{{cite news|last=Condotta|first=Bob|title=New Husky Stadium: on time, on budget |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/huskyfootball/2018987898_huskystadium25.html |newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=August 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Apple Cup]] in [[2011 Washington Huskies football team|2011]] was moved to  CenturyLink to advance the start of the project by several weeks.

The new Husky Stadium was developed by Wright Runstad &amp; Company, designed by [[360 Architecture]], and constructed by [[Turner Construction]] company. The steel decking was supplied by Profile Steel. The new stadium is the first and primary income source of a completely remodeled athletic district which includes a new $19 million [[Husky Ballpark]], a new track and field stadium, renovated soccer stadium, $50 million basketball operations and practice facility and recently completed projects such as the Husky Legends Center, the [[Conibear Shellhouse]] and Alaska Airlines Arena renovations, and the construction of the Dempsey Indoor facility. This major remodel of the athletic village coincided with construction for an underground station for a northern extension of the [[Link Light Rail]] system and a [[Evergreen Point Floating Bridge (2016)|replacement]] of the [[Evergreen Point Floating Bridge]].

The renovation project incorporated a new grand concourse, press box, video and audio system, and football offices, as well as new and improved amenities, concession stands, and bathrooms. The track that had enclosed the playing field was removed, and the field itself lowered by four feet to make room for additional seating closer to the sidelines. The student section was relocated from the north sideline to the west end zone, and the temporary bleachers in the east end zone were replaced with a permanent structure featuring field-level suites. The addition of box suites reduced the seating capacity from 72,500 to 70,138.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/pac12/2013/08/29/husky-stadium-university-of-washington-renovations-debut-boise-state/2725873/ "Husky Stadium to debut after $280M renovation".

[[Athlon Sports]], 2013-06-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, new parking garages were constructed and facilities throughout the athletic village were renovated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=uwfacilities01&amp;date=20061201|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |first=Bob |last=Condotta|title=UW Athletic Director Unveils New Husky Stadium Drawings|date=December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seattle Seahawks==
The [[National Football League|NFL's]] [[Seattle Seahawks]] first played home games at Husky Stadium in [[1994 Seattle Seahawks season|1994]], while unplanned repairs were made to the interior ceiling of the [[Kingdome]]. A total of five Seahawk games were at Husky Stadium; two pre-season and three regular season. The Kingdome reopened for the final five home games, starting on November 6.

The Seahawks later played the [[2000 Seattle Seahawks season|2000]] and [[2001 Seattle Seahawks season|2001]] seasons at Husky Stadium while their new home, Seahawks Stadium (now [[CenturyLink Field]]), was constructed on the footprint of the demolished Kingdome.

==NFL exhibition games==
Between 1955 and 1975, Husky Stadium hosted 12 NFL preseason games.  The [[San Francisco 49ers]] played six times at the stadium, the most of any team. Other teams to make multiple appearances include the [[New York Giants]], [[Los Angeles Rams]], [[Cleveland Browns]], and [[Arizona Cardinals|Chicago/St. Louis Cardinals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=McKillop |url=http://www.footballgeography.com/nfl-exhibition-games-played-at-neutral-sites/|title=NFL Exhibition Games Played at Neutral Sites » FootballGeography.com: Includes Non-League Away Games and/or Games Played at Non-League Stadiums|publisher=FootballGeography.com|accessdate=August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point after the [[1970 NFL season]], [[Ralph Wilson]] came close to moving the [[Buffalo Bills]] from dilapidated [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|War Memorial Stadium]] to Husky Stadium.&lt;ref name=mtexp&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19710115&amp;id=ezMsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xMsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4930,2267693|newspaper=Spartanburg (SC) Herald |title=Memphis, Tampa express interest in Buffalo Bills |agency=Associated Press |date=January 15, 1971 |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The threat of relocation prompted the developers in the Buffalo suburbs to construct Rich Stadium (later Ralph Wilson Stadium and now [[New Era Field]]), which opened in 1973. The Bills have resided there ever since.

'''Maroon Friends 1946''' ({{lang-bs|'Bordo prijatelji 1946'}}) is an [[FK Sarajevo]] fan association and [[advocacy group]] organized by influential individuals from the financial, political and cultural sectors of Bosnian society with the aim of lobbying both locally and internationally for the club and influencing club policies.&lt;ref name="training1143"&gt;{{cite news | date=26 July 2011 | url=http://www.bordoprijatelji.ba/index.php/o-nama | title=O nama | work=Official website | accessdate=28 July 2016 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803184711/http://www.bordoprijatelji.ba/index.php/o-nama | archivedate=3 August 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The association has strong informal ties to FK Sarajevo [[Ultras]], [[Horde Zla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sport.ba/clanak/181674/jedna-od-najuspjesnijih-godina-u-historiji-bordo-kluba |title=Jedna od najuspješnijih godina u historiji kluba |work=Sport.ba |date=29 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2009 a handful of eminent supporters of FK Sarajevo, including fashion designer [[Haad (Adnan Hajrulahović)|Adnan Hajrulahović]], poet and musician [[Benjamin Isović]], entrepreneur Avdo Salihbegović and others started having informal meetings about the possibility of organizing a new supporter's association with the goal of helping the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.klix.ba/sport/kako-su-nastali-bordo-prijatelji-vizionari-koji-su-cetiri-godine-vodili-bitku-za-bolje-sarajevo/150613044 |title=Kako su nastali Bordo prijatelji: Vizionari koji su četiri godine vodili bitku za bolje Sarajevo |work=Klix.ba |date=29 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These meetings led to the formal registration of an Association of Citizens in 2010, which quickly struck a strong partnership with the club's Ultras group, [[Horde zla]]. After a thorough analysis of club finances and the announced shift in [[UEFA]] licensing, the association came to the conclusion that the club would be in a dire situation by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.klix.ba/sport/kako-su-nastali-bordo-prijatelji-vizionari-koji-su-cetiri-godine-vodili-bitku-za-bolje-sarajevo/150613044 |title=Kako su nastali Bordo prijatelji: Vizionari koji su četiri godine vodili bitku za bolje Sarajevo |work=Klix.ba |date=29 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.klix.ba/sport/nogomet/bordo-prijatelji-1946-fk-sarajevo-je-brand/100419108 |title=Bordo prijatelji 1946: "FK Sarajevo je brand" |work=Klix.ba |date=29 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the founding Assembly a platform and organizational plan were forged under the working title ''Projekt 2010-2014''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fksinfo.com/novosti/predstavljamo-bordo-prijatelji-1946/985 |title=Predstavljamo: Bordo prijatelji 1946 |work=Fksinfo.com |date=29 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The association wrote a new template for the club's statute and found bureaucratic loopholes in Bosnia's law in order to potentially attract foreign investment seeing the country has no [[Sport policies of the European Union|Sports Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsport.ba/bh_fudbal/prijedlog-novog-statuta-fk-sarajevo/79848 |title=Prijedlog novog statuta FK Sarajevo |work=Sportsport.ba |date=29 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FK Sarajevo's management at the time, witnessing the association's polyvalence, quickly invited members to join the club's assembly and board, which they did. On 14 July 2012 the new club statute was voted into power, enabling [[Malaysia]]n businessman, investor and Chairman of [[Berjaya Group]], [[Vincent Tan]], who had earlier been lobbied by [[Scotiabank]] director and association member [[Edis Kusturica|Feđa Kusturica]], to buy majority stocks and become ''de facto'' owner of the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/25/cardiff-city-vincent-tan-bosnia |title=Cardiff City owner Vincent Tan takes control of club in Bosnia |newspaper=The Guardian |date=25 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.fksarajevo.ba/bs/vijesti/novi-statut-fudbalskog-kluba-sarajevo/714 |title=Novi STATUT Fudbalskog Kluba Sarajevo |work=FK Sarajevo Official website |date=29 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
Maroon Friends 1946 has been publishing a monthly magazine named ''Maroon Fan'' ({{lang-bs|Bordo Fan}}) since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.klix.ba/sport/nogomet/izasao-drugi-broj-magazina-bordo-fan/110610122 |title=

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3857">[[File:Pitching machine.jpg|thumb|250px|A hand-fed pitching machine]]
A '''pitching machine''' is a machine that automatically [[pitch (baseball)|pitches]] a [[baseball (object)|baseball]] to a [[batting (baseball)|batter]] at different speeds and styles. Most machines are hand-fed, but there are some that automatically feed. There are multiple types of pitching machines; softball, baseball, youth, adult, and a combination of both softball and baseball.

==History==
In 1897, mathematics instructor [[Charles Hinton]] designed a gunpowder-powered baseball pitching machine for the [[Princeton University]] baseball team's batting practice.&lt;ref&gt;Hinton, Charles, "A Mechanical Pitcher", [[Harper's Weekly]], March 20, 1897, p. 301&amp;ndash;302&lt;/ref&gt; According to one source it caused several injuries, and may have been in part responsible for Hinton's dismissal from Princeton that year.&lt;ref&gt;Physics in Higher-Dimensional Manifolds [http://www.uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/bitstream/10012/1276/1/ssseahra2003.pdf bottom page 5]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the machine was versatile: it was capable of throwing variable speeds with an adjustable breech size and firing curve balls by the use of two rubber-coated steel fingers at the muzzle of the pitcher.&lt;ref&gt;Hinton, Charles, "The Motion of a Baseball", ''The Yearbook of the Minneapolis Society of Engineers'', May 1908, p. 18&amp;ndash;28&lt;/ref&gt; Hinton successfully introduced the machine to the [[University of Minnesota]] where he worked as an assistant professor until 1900.

The arm-type pitching machine was designed by Paul Giovagnoli in 1952, for use on his driving range. Using a metal arm mounted to a large gear, this type of machine simulates the motion of an actual pitcher, throwing balls with consistent speed and direction. One- and two-wheel style machines were originally patented by Bartley N. Marty in 1916. &lt;ref&gt;US Patent 1211738[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/1211738.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;US Patent 1204468[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/1204468.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Pitching machines come in a variety of styles. However, the two most popular machines are an arm action machine and a circular wheel machine. The arm action machine simulates the delivery of a pitcher and carries a ball at the end of a bracket, much like a hand would. The arm action machine then delivers the ball in an overhand motion. The circular wheel machine contains one, two or three wheels that spin much like a bike tire. The wheels on these machines are usually set in either a horizontal or vertical fashion. With a circular machine, a ball shoots out towards the hitter after it is fed into the wheel or wheels. Three-wheel machines are more easily adjusted to be able to throw a variety of pitches and they can be used for a wide range of other practice scenarios, such as ground work or flyballs.

The use of pitching machines allows baseball and softball players the opportunity to get batting practice on their own. Most batting machines are set up in a [[batting cage]], a netted area that will contain the balls after they are hit. By using a pitching machine and a batting cage, hitters can get a huge number of batting reps without having to drag other players out to a baseball field or wear out the arms of team pitchers or coaches. The cost of pitching machines varies greatly.

==Use in Little League==
In the youngest divisions of Little League, and other youth baseball organizations, pitching machines are used instead of live pitching. This is done to give the kids more experience hitting the ball, as pitchers at that age would tend to throw few strikes. Simple spring-loaded manual models are common (such as from Louisville Slugger) as are battery-powered compressed-air machines (such as from Zooka).

[[File:Rottnest-Channel-Swim-start-2004.jpg|thumb|350px|The start of one wave of the Rottnest Channel Swim, 2004]]
The '''Rottnest Channel Swim''' is an annual [[open water swimming]] event from [[Cottesloe, Western Australia|Cottesloe Beach]] through [[Gage Roads]] to [[Rottnest Island]], off the coast of [[Western Australia]], near [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. The distance is approximately 20 kilometres and it is one of the largest open-water swimming events in the world, with 2400 swimmers participating in the 2015 event.&lt;ref name= new&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-12/port-to-pub-new-rottnest-swim-planned-for-2016/6935266 2016 Port to Pub: New Rottnest swim planned to meet demand for gruelling ocean crossing event]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is held in February each year and is open to solo swimmers and teams of two or four. A second event, Champions of the Channel for elite swimmers, was introduced in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/siblings-ben-and-jenna-freeman-making-wakes-ahead-of-rottnest-channel-swims-inaugural-champions-of-the-channel-race/news-story/9f6a9b5e1b01bdf9bc50955097b75d86 Siblings Ben and Jenna Freeman making waves ahead of Rottnest Channel Swim’s inaugural Champions of the Channel race]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
When Rottnest Island was used as a prison it was rumoured that some of the prisoners swam back to the mainland, although there is no proof that any did. However some may have crossed by resting on [[Carnac Island|Carnac]] and [[Garden Island (Western Australia)|Garden Islands]]. The first documented crossing by a swimmer was Gerd Von Dincklage-Schulinburg, on 24 January 1956. This led the Weekend Mail newspaper to hold the first organised race to the island in March later that year, which was completed by four participants.&lt;ref name= history&gt;[http://rottnestchannelswimassociation.com.au/history/history-ofrcs/ History of the Rottnest Channel Swim]&lt;/ref&gt; The first woman to swim to the island was Lesley Cherriman on 13 April 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.users.bigpond.net.au/timtucak/voigt19.htm Regarding Schulinburg, Voigt, and Cherriman]&lt;/ref&gt; The youngest swimmer to compete was [[Kutraleeswaran]] from [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]], who completed the swim at the age of 13 in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/sports/2005/oct/06spec.htm Why Kutraleeswaran stopped swimming]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the modest success of the 1956 event, another organised race to the island would not be held until February 23, 1991, with sixteen solo swimmers and seven teams competing. The success of the swim lead it to it becoming an annual event.&lt;ref name= history/&gt; Due to the overwhelming popularity of the race, a ballot has been held since 2006 to limit the number of participants in the competition.&lt;ref name= new/&gt;

A '''selector''' in [[cricket]] is a person given the administrative duty to choose the players that will represent a particular team in a match.&lt;ref&gt; Arya Sekhar Chakraborty.

There is typically heavy scrutiny on national team selectors, including those of the major [[Test cricket|Test]] cricketing nations like [[Australian national cricket team|Australia]], [[England national cricket team|England]], and [[India national cricket team|India]]. This is largely because in cricket, the highest level of the sport uniquely revolves around international competition,&lt;ref&gt; Devendra Pandey.

Should the teams they select fail, the selectors are often vilified for the national side's poor performances.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Pierik.

'''The Merry Monarch''' (1842 &amp;ndash; after 1859) was a British [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse and [[Horse breeding#Terminology|sire]]. In a career that lasted from July 1844 to May 1846 he ran four times and won only one race. That race, however, was the 1845 [[Epsom Derby]], in which he recorded an unexpected victory. After one race in 1846 he was retired to [[stud (animal)|stud]] where he made no impression as a sire.

==Background==
The Merry Monarch was a bay horse bred by his owner, William Gratwicke of Ham Manor, near [[Angmering]] in [[Sussex]]. Gratwicke also bred his dam, The Margravine, who was a sister to the 1829 Derby winner [[Frederick (horse)|Frederick]]. His sire, Slane, was runner-up in the [[Ascot Gold Cup]] and, thanks largely to The Merry Monarch's Derby win, was [[Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland|Champion sire]] in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbheritage.com/HistoricSires/LeadingSires/GBLeadSires.html |title=Leading Sires of Great Britain and Ireland |publisher=Tbheritage.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Merry Monarch was sent into training with [[John Forth|John "Daddy" Forth]] who, at the age of sixty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epsomderby.org/facts-and-figures.php |title=Facts and Figures |publisher=Epsomderby.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223033550/http://www.epsomderby.org/facts-and-figures.php |archivedate=2011-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; had trained and ridden Frederick in the Derby. Gratwicke's horses were based at [[Goodwood, West Sussex|Goodwood]] at a stable owned by the [[Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond|Duke of Richmond]]. Following a disagreement with the Duke,&lt;ref name="Mortimer"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mortimer | first1 = Roger |last2=Onslow|first2=Richard|last3=Willett|first3=Peter| title = Biographical Encyclopedia of British Flat Racing| publisher=Macdonald and Jane’s | year = 1978| isbn = 0-354-08536-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gratwicke moved his horses to [[Newmarket, Suffolk]].

==Racing career==

===1844: two-year-old season===
On his first racecourse appearance, The Merry Monarch ran in the Ham Stakes at [[Goodwood Racecourse|Goodwood]] in July. He finished unplaced behind Refraction, a filly who went on to win [[Epsom Oaks|The Oaks]] in 1845.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59763996?|title=04 Oct 1845 - THE DERBY STAKES AT EPSOM, 1845 |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1845: three-year-old season===
The Merry Monarch's first race of 1846 was the Derby at [[Epsom Downs Racecourse|Epsom]]. The build-up to the race was marred by reports of a plot to either lame or poison Old England, one of the favourites for the race,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; while another one of the leading contenders, The Libel, was allegedly drugged ("doctored").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3AXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA476&amp;dq=%22the+merry+monarch%22+derby&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_csRT7OSBIaX8gPl58jxAw&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20merry%20monarch%22%20&amp;f=false |title=The Sportsman's magazine of life in London and the country - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poor weather on the morning of the race did not deter the crowd, which was reported to be as large and unruly as ever.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59764672?|title=11 Oct 1845 - THE DERBY DAY, MAY 28, 1845 |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ridden by the little-known Foster Bell, The Merry Monarch started at odds of [[Fixed odds betting#Fractional odds|15/1]] in a record field of thirty one runners. These official odds however, were offered jointly for The Merry Monarch and his stable companion Doleful:&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PSkGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA445&amp;dq=%22the+merry+monarch%22+derby&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_csRT7OSBIaX8gPl58jxAw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20merry%20monarch%22%20derby&amp;f=false |title=The Sportsman - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to ''The Sporting Magazine'', odds of 35/1 would have been more accurate reflection of the actual betting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jBQGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA435&amp;dq=%22the+merry+monarch%22+derby&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pNMRT_u0DYj_8QOB0NDKAw&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20merry%20monarch%22%20derby&amp;f=false |title=The Sporting magazine; or Monthly calendar of the transactions of the turf ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The start of the race was delayed by almost an hour by a series of false starts and an incident in which one of the leading contenders, Alarm was kicked by The Libel. Alarm threw off his jockey, Nat Flatman, ran into a chain fence and then galloped loose down the course for several minutes before being caught. Both Alarm and Flatman were injured, but took part in the race when it eventually got under way. The Merry Monarch was among the leading group from the start, and was in fourth place at the turn into the straight, where one horse fell and several others were badly hampered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59764701?|title=11 Oct 1845 - THE RACE |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approaching the final [[furlong]], Bell sent The Merry Monarch to the front and he established a clear lead before staying on well to win "in clever style" by a length from Annandale, with Old England a neck away in third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article8757389?|title=26 Sep 1845 - THE DERBY AND OAKS. Odds before the start |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a major surprise to most observers, including, it was reported, the winner's own connections,&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uIMEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA383&amp;dq=%22the+merry+monarch%22+derby&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=r9ERT_7CDsir8QPV5tnfAw&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20merry%20monarch%22%20derby&amp;f=false |title=The New sporting magazine - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had believed that their other runner, Doleful, had the better chance of winning.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

In July, The Merry Monarch was sent to Goodwood for the Gratwicke Stakes. He finished second, beaten a head by Hersey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kjsGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA499&amp;dq=%22the+merry+monarch%22+goodwood+%22gratwicke+stakes%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c9wRT7yNIYXU8gPB4dj1Aw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20merry%20monarch%22%20goodwood%20%22gratwicke%20stakes%22&amp;f=false |title=The Sportsman's magazine of life in London and the country, ed., by Miles's Boy - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; a mare whose only previous win had come in a "fifty pound plate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YoEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=%22the+merry+monarch%22+derby&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_csRT7OSBIaX8gPl58jxAw&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20merry%20monarch%22&amp;f=false |title=The Sporting review, ed. by 'Craven'. - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his defeat, The Merry Monarch remained among the leading fancies for the [[St. Leger Stakes|St Leger]],&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; but he did not appear again that year.

The Merry Monarch's prize of £3,975 for the Derby was enough to make him the third highest money winner of the British season behind Refraction and Sweetmeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27453378?|title=29 Jul 1846 - SPORTING |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1846: four-year-old season===
On his only race as a four-year-old, The Merry Monarch returned to Epsom for the Grand Stand Plate, a mile and a quarter handicap on the day after the Derby. Carrying top weight of 118 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]], he finished unplaced behind an unnamed colt owned by [[James Merry (Scottish politician)|James Merry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FuQNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=%22the+merry+monarch%22+derby&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3tQRT8SzLo7y8QOo9IWCBA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20merry%20monarch%22%20derby&amp;f=false |title=the racing calendar for the year 1846 - charles and james weatherby - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the end of the year, The Merry Monarch changed hands three times. Following his run at Epsom he was bought by [[Lord George Bentinck]], but a month later, Bentinck decided to give up his racing interests to concentrate on politics and sold all his horses for £10,000 to [[Edward Lloyd-Mostyn, 2nd Baron Mostyn|Edward Lloyd-Mostyn]]. The Merry Monarch was put up for auction and bought back by his original owner, William Gratwicke for 78 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]].&lt;ref name="tbheritage1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Patricia Erigero Thoroughbred Heritage |url=http://www.tbheritage.com/Portraits/Slane.html#MerryMonarch |title=Slane |publisher=Tbheritage.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
''The Sportsman'' magazine described The Merry Monarch as "a very bad horse" and his Derby win as the biggest "fluke" in the history of the race.&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt; ''The Farmer's Magazine'' concurred, calling the result "one of the greatest flukes that we have on record".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=er-9XUjaNn4C&amp;pg=PA474-IA2&amp;dq=%22the+merry+monarch%22+derby&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_csRT7OSBIaX8gPl58jxAw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20merry%20monarch%22%20derby&amp;f=false |title=The Farmer's Magazine - Rogerson &amp; Tuxford - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stud career==
The Merry Monarch stood as a stallion at his owner's stud at Ham, where his fee was initially 10 guineas. He attracted few mares however, and in only his second year at stud, he was covering mares at no fee apart from "a [[sovereign (British coin)|sovereign]] for the groom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5OsNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA405&amp;dq=%22the+merry+monarch%22+derby&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EtcRT6ndDsWD8gPLg5iHBA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwADgy#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20merry%20monarch%22%20derby&amp;f=false |title=the racing calendar for the year 1848 - charles and james weatherby - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the damsire of a filly named Bertha, who finished second in the [[1000 Guineas]] and won the [[Nassau Stakes]] in 1862, but otherwise made no impact.&lt;ref name="tbheritage1"/&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Sara Long, with the faith based and family oriented [[Dove Foundation]] gave the film a positive review, writing, "''The Red Sneakers'' is an enjoyable movie based around inner desires, and what one knows is right as far as actions go ... Then the movie turns around to focus on the inner battle over how to behave against what one wants, and what one should do. Though this movie does have several instances of profanity, it is nothing too severe. Because the overall content is well displayed, the film is approved for ages 12 and up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dove.org/MovieReview.asp?Unique_ID=3629 Long, Sara]. [[Dove Foundation]], February 10, 2002.  Accessed: May 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The torpedoes are marked T, halfbacks are marked H, the defenseman, or libero is marked D, and the goaltender is marked G.]]

The '''torpedo system''' is an [[ice hockey]] on-ice system first used by the Swedish team [[Djurgårdens IF Hockey|Djurgårdens IF]]. The coach of Djurgårdens IF, [[Hardy Nilsson]], took the system with him and it was used extensively by the [[Sweden national men's ice hockey team|Swedish national hockey team]] in [[IIHF|international competition]].&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;{{cite web|title=THE YEAR IN IDEAS: A TO Z.; The Torpedo|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4DD143CF93AA35751C1A9679C8B63|accessdate=2008-01-04|author=Jeff Z. Klein|date= December 9, 2001|work= |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system converts the traditional hockey layout of three forwards and two defensemen, into two ''torpedoes'' up front, two ''halfbacks'', and one lone defenceman (or ''libero'').  The torpedoes are responsible for [[forecheck|forechecking]] in the corners when the puck is in the offensive zone, and stay around the neutral zone to be sprung into a scoring position (by a ''stretch pass'' or ''torpedo pass'').  The halfbacks are all-purpose players that run the offense from the faceoff circles in the offensive zone, and defend against the other team's torpedoes.  The libero protects the rear of the ice.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite web|title=Damn the Torpedo|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2060571/|accessdate=2008-01-04|author=Ben McGrath|date=January 10, 2002|work=|publisher=Slate magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system is used in international hockey by the Swedish team, due to the large ice surface, and the lack of a [[two-line pass]] offside (which would stop play with a two-line pass).  It contrasted the [[neutral zone trap]], which was popular in the 1990s, and which stifled fast skating and playmaking by crowding the neutral zone with players.  The system was originated by the [[Boston Bruins]] of the late 1950s; it was later adopted by the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] during the 1960s. The torpedo mode could not be completely implemented in the [[National Hockey League]] until 2005 when the [[red line (hockey)|red line]] was eliminated, allowing for [[two-line pass|two-line passes]] to spring the torpedoes.

The system was used to describe the Swedish national men's hockey team's approach during the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Games]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/olympics/2002/ice_hockey/news/2002/02/15/sweden_canada_ap/|title=Torpedo blast|accessdate=2007-12-31|author= Associated Press|date=February 15, 2002|work=|publisher=CNN/Sports Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804EEDF103FF935A25751C0A9649C8B63|title=Swedish Offense Easily Dismantles Talented Canadian Team |accessdate=2007-12-31|author=Joe Lapointe|date=February 16, 2002|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was punctuated by a preliminary 5-2 win over the eventual gold-medal winning Canadian team.

An '''uncontested shot''' is a term used in [[basketball]]. It encompasses shots from a [[layup]], a [[slam dunk]], and [[Jump shot (basketball)|jump shots]]. It is any kind of shot in which the shooter has no one contesting or interfering with the shot. In competitive leagues, an uncontested shot is one in which a defender is not within five feet of the shooter or one in which a defender is not near enough to alter the [[Offense (sports)|offensive]] player's shot in any way. The primary [[strategy]] of most offensive plays is to gain an uncontested shot and defensively to prevent one.

In the [[NBA]] an uncontested shot is called a bunny or a snowbird.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/analysis/00422966.html NBA analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Undisputed''''' is a 2002 American [[drama film|drama]] [[List of sports films|sports film]] written, produced and directed by [[Walter Hill (director)|Walter Hill]] and starring [[Wesley Snipes]] and [[Ving Rhames]]. It was released in the United States on August 23, 2002.

The film performed poorly at the box-office and received mixed reviews from critics; nevertheless it later found success in the [[home video market]] and began a film saga with a [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]] without any of the original cast members.

==Plot==
Undisputed [[heavyweight]] [[boxing]] champion George "Iceman" Chambers (Rhames) is convicted of rape and sentenced to a new prison in the desert, called Sweetwater. The high-security facility is populated by hardened criminals. Unaware of the prison's ways and its unique hierarchy, the pompous and bratty Chambers tries to impress upon the inmates his status as a champion boxer.

The prison camp, within its own walls, has a riveting competition on which a betting syndicate thrives. Criminals fight in boxing matches with very lax rules, thus making it a very addictive and lucrative venture for the syndicate. The most popular boxer behind bars is Sweetwater's undefeated Monroe Hutchens (Snipes), who ends up in solitary confinement after Chambers picks a fight with him in the mess hall.

Sensing the brewing hatred for the heavyweight champion, an incarcerated mob boss named Ripstein (Falk) senses potential in a match  between the modest Hutchens and the egomaniacal Chambers. Ripstein, a lifelong boxing fan, proposes a match and the warden (Arndt) is persuaded to look the other way.

As all the arrangements are finally organized, an eagerly awaited fight night arrives. All hell breaks loose with the haughty professional champ going all out against the unputdownable prison warrior. Chambers knocks down Hutchens twice (and with the 'London Prize' format, each knockdown counts as the end of a round, as the boxer is given only 60 seconds to get up.) In the third round, Hutchens charges back and knocks Chambers down for the first time in his career, sending the crowd of prisoners into a frenzy. Finally, in the fourth round Hutchens officially KO's Chambers to become the undisputed champion.

Ripstein's Mexican assistant reveals in a voice over that Ripstein died three weeks after the fight, but in his will, he left him $2,000,000. Chambers was released on parole, and Hutchens received the money for his sister, who was experiencing hardship on the outside.

It is also revealed that Chambers and his manager denied that the fight with Hutchens ever occurred, and that it was all a rumor. Months later, Chambers wins back the Heavyweight Championship of the World. The whole cell block watches the televised fight, and laugh and cheer Monroe's name after hearing Chambers being crowned the 'undisputed' heavyweight champion of the world.

==Production==
===Development===
The film was based on an original script by Walter Hill and David Giler. Hill had just come off the science fiction film ''Supernova'' on which he had been recut by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] among others. "One, it was embarrassing and, two, it made me think about quitting," said Hill. "While Coppola's intentions were honorable, I think he made a bad situation worse. I didn't do anything for a year. I was fortunate enough that I could buy my children a hot lunch. Then, I decided I wanted to work again."&lt;ref name="lovell"&gt;{{cite news|title='Undisputed' director Walter Hill still is king of the ring|last=Lovell|first= Glenn|newspaper= Knight Ridder Tribune News Service|date=26 Aug 2002|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill had always wanted to make a boxing film, being a fan of the sport since he was young.  "Boxing is easy to indict," says Hill. "There are a lot of terrible things about boxing. However, that's only one side of the coin. The other side is that boxing has a power and a beauty and a drama and fascination that makes it a very compelling sport."&lt;ref name="lovell"/&gt;

Hill and Giler were having lunch one day and discussed Mike Tyson, who was sentenced to prison for rape in 1992. Giler said they thought "it's amazing how no studio has made a film out of this basic situation of the heavyweight champion of the world going to prison, the toughest environment in the world," said Giler.&lt;ref name="lovell"/&gt; Hill went and wrote some paragraphs about the idea then he and Giler wrote a full script.&lt;ref name="can"/&gt;

However Hill says while the Tyson case was the departure point, "There are a number of prize fighters who have been in trouble with the law. Our story looks at how a tough guy and celebrity would handle life in prison. The more we wrote, the more we wrote away from the Tyson story."&lt;ref name="ving"&gt;{{cite news|title=AN ACTOR BOXES BEHIND BARS IN `UNDISPUTED'|first=Angela|last= Dawson|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=18 Aug 2002|page= L.12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill says he was really interested in what happened when "a heavyweight champion goes to the toughest environment possible in American culture, the American prison system."&lt;ref name="box"&gt;{{cite news|title=Cornerman; Emanual Steward, trainer of 29 world champions, prepares Wesley Snipes to fight in 'Undisputed.'|last=Holmes|first= Emory|newspaper= Los Angeles Times |date=21 Aug 2002|page= F.1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"What we tried to show is how, under odd circumstances, a convicted murderer and a convicted rapist are capable of a moment of grace," said Hill. "They're both heroic."&lt;ref name="lovell"/&gt;

The film refuses to say if the champion boxer was actually guilty. "It is absolutely ambiguous in this movie, ambiguous in the sense that it is very clear that he believes himself to be innocent. It is also absolutely clear that the woman involved believes herself to have been abused and raped... If you want to know what I suspect, I suspect they're both right. It has to do with different terms, different values and different understanding of the basic compact when men and women go to bed together."&lt;ref name="lovell"/&gt;

===Casting===
Hill said the film needed to be cast with black actors to have "serious credibility,"&lt;ref name="walter"/&gt; and that he "was determined not to have a movie where it looked like the actors couldn't box."&lt;ref name="box"/&gt; He took the treatment to [[Wesley Snipes]] who was interested in the story even before the script had been written. "I told him it was conceivable that he could play either [lead] role, but what will not change is the fight and who wins in the end," Hill said.&lt;ref name="walter"/&gt;

Hill then sent the script to [[Ving Rhames]], who called back the next day, saying he wanted to play the Ice Man; Snipes was happy to play the other role.&lt;ref name="walter"/&gt; Rhames was in peak physical condition having been preparing for two years to star in a film about [[Sonny Liston]], ''Night Train'', that ultimately was never made.&lt;ref name="high"/&gt; He said that ''Undisputed'' was "not ''[[Rocky]]''... It's not clear-cut who you're supposed to root for."&lt;ref name="ving"/&gt; He had worked together with Snipes on Broadway earlier, the last time in 1986 in ''The Boys of Winter''.

It was a battle to get the film financed with two black stars, particularly as the film need to appeal to international audiences. "There was a lot of pressure to change one of the characters to be white," Giler said, "but we thought it would be unrealistic... We haven't seen a white fighter of merit since [[Rocky Marciano]]."&lt;ref name="can"&gt;{{cite news|title=It was a battle to get Undisputed... |last=Portman|first= Jamie|newspaper= CanWest News |date=28 Aug 2002|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill said that "heavyweight boxing within the past 50 years has been the purview of black men with a couple of tiny exceptions. This is a movie about boxing so we wanted to get it right. I think that the idea of the heavyweight champion of the world not being a black man would seem extraordinary. But if you did cast a black man as the heavyweight champion and then out him into a prison where the prison champion is white guy - well, what are we talking about?"&lt;ref name="can"/&gt; There was also pressure to make the film less "tough".&lt;ref name="can"/&gt;

Snipes recalled, "The film was on. It was off. The money came. The money fell out. Every day, it was a wonder we were making this movie. Then, after we made the film, nobody knew whether it was ever going to come out."&lt;ref name="can"/&gt; He prepared for the role by training with Emanuel Steward, who had trained 29 world champions, including [[Tommy Hearns]] and [[Lennox Lewis]]. "[My character] was supposed to be the best," Snipes said, "so if I've got to look like the best, and live up to this character, I've got to get the best and work with the best."&lt;ref name="box"/&gt; Rhames was already in peak condition due to preparing for the aborted Liston film; the film's fight choreographer Cole McKay took over training of Rhames once filming began.

===Shooting===
The movie was going to be filmed in a closed-down prison in Jean, Nevada. However, according to Jeanne Corcoran, the Nevada Film Office's production manager, the prison "didn't have the right look. It has a great fence, a good tower, but the interiors tend to be more dormitory-like."&lt;ref name="high"/&gt; Instead it was decided to shoot the film in an unopened wing of the medium-security High Desert State Prison in Indian Springs, Nevada.&lt;ref name="high"&gt;{{cite news|title="Undisputed" to battle with Snipes, Rhames|last=Cling|first= Carol|newspaper= Las Vegas Review - Journal |date=22 Jan 2001|page= 5E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shooting took place in January and February 2001. The film was shot over 39 days with finance raised from a number of American and European companies.&lt;ref name="hill"/&gt;

During the final fight, Snipes weighed only 178 pounds while Rhames was around 220 pounds. To mask the disparity, fight choreographer Cole McKay had Snipes fight upright and Rhames hunch forward in a crouching stance. For the final fight, Snipes said he and McKay would "choreograph six or seven movements and then we'd improvise. We improvised the tail-end of each round, and that gave a certain amount of spontaneity and reality to it."&lt;ref name="box"/&gt;

Neither actor used a body double, and all of the body shots are real. "Everybody on the set was wanting to see, 'Man who's going to win the fight?' " Steward recalls. "There were no 'John Wayne punches' in this movie at all. It was the closest that I have ever saw to real fightin'. I was mad because we didn't have [someone] to knock out for real."&lt;ref name="box"/&gt;

Hill later said, "Some say Hollywood movies that are made about boxing are just metaphors for other things, I think I've made one that's actually about boxing and not a metaphor."&lt;ref name="walter"&gt;[http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/walterhill_int.htm Clint Morris, "Undisputed: Interview with Walter Hill", ''Webwombat''] accessed 25 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-production===
Distribution rights were purchased by Miramax Pictures for a reported $4.5 million.&lt;ref name="hollywood"&gt;{{cite news |title='Signs' crops up as leader of field|last=
Fuson|first= Brian|newspaper= Hollywood Reporter|date=26 August 2002|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were press reports that Miramax head [[Harvey Weinstein]] wanted additional scenes reshot which made Wesley Snipes more sympathetic, but that Snipes refused to do them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SNIPES MAY SUFFER RESHOOTING PAINS|newspaper= New York Daily News|date=19 Feb 2002|page= 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 48% based on reviews from 104 critics. The site's consensus is: While not the deepest boxing movie out there, Undisputed is successful at hitting its aspiration of being nothing more than a genre picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/undisputed/ | title = Undisputed (2002) | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher = [[Flixster]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hill said he was "very happy about" the film. "I mean no film is beyond criticism, but I think we've made a very modest movie. Heck, we did it in 39 days, it cost $20 million, which is very cheap for Hollywood standards, and tells a good story. I guess it's the literary equivalent of a short story... With all the action in it and the tough guy aspects, it's going to appeal mainly to a young male audience. But, also the nostalgia of the sport might appeal to older males. Based on some of the reviews I've read already, the women don't seem to be enjoying it as much. But you hope for the best."

The film debuted at number 8 at the box office making $4.7 million in its first week.&lt;ref name="hollywood"/&gt;

==Soundtrack==
{{main|Undisputed (soundtrack)}}
A soundtrack containing [[hip hop music]] was released on March 5, 2002 by [[Universal Records]]. It peaked at #101 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and #41 on the [[Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums]].

==Sequels==
The film received three [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]]s. The first was ''[[Undisputed II: Last Man Standing]]'', which was released in 2006. A second sequel, ''[[Undisputed III: Redemption]]'', was released in 2010, and follows ''Undisputed II''{{'}}s Yuri Boyka as the main character. A third sequel, again focusing on the latter character, ''[[Boyka: Undisputed]]'', was released in 2016.
