'''Abetalipoproteinemia''' is a disorder that interferes with the normal absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins from food. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/abetalipoproteinemia|title=Abetalipoproteinemia|last=Reference|first=Genetics Home|website=Genetics Home Reference|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is caused by a mutation in [[microsomal triglyceride transfer protein]] resulting in deficiencies in the apolipoproteins B-48 and B-100, which are used in the synthesis and exportation of [[chylomicrons]] and [[VLDL]] respectively. It is not to be confused with [[familial dysbetalipoproteinemia]].

It is a rare [[autosomal recessive]] disorder.&lt;ref name="pmid17275380"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benayoun|first1=Liat|last2=Granot|first2=Esther|last3=Rizel|first3=Leah|last4=Allon-Shalev|first4=Stavit|last5=Behar|first5=Doron M.|last6=Ben-Yosef|first6=Tamar|title=Abetalipoproteinemia in Israel: Evidence for a founder mutation in the Ashkenazi Jewish population and a contiguous gene deletion in an Arab patient|journal=Molecular Genetics and Metabolism|date=April 2007|volume=90|issue=4|pages=453–7|doi=10.1016/j.ymgme.2006.12.010|pmid=17275380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presentation ==

===Symptoms===
Often symptoms will arise that indicate the body is not absorbing or making the lipoproteins that it needs. These symptoms usually appear ''en masse''.

These symptoms come as follows:
*[[Failure to thrive]]/Failure to grow in infancy&lt;ref name="pmid20953537"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|last1=Hasosah|first1=MY|last2=Shesha|first2=SJ|last3=Sukkar|first3=GA|last4=Bassuni|first4=WY|title=Rickets and dysmorphic findings in a child with abetalipoproteinemia|volume=31|issue=10|pages=1169–71|journal=Saudi medical journal|pmid=20953537}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Steatorrhea]]/Fatty, pale stools&lt;ref name="pmid20953537" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20626336"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moutzouri|first=E|author2=Elisaf, M|author3= Liberopoulos, EN|title=Hypocholesterolemia.|journal=Current Vascular Pharmacology|date=March 2011|volume=9|issue=2|pages=200–12|pmid=20626336|doi=10.2174/157016111794519354}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Frothy stools&lt;ref name="pmid20953537" /&gt;
*Foul smelling stools&lt;ref name="pmid20953537" /&gt;
*Protruding abdomen
*[[Intellectual disability]]/[[developmental delay]]
*[[Developmental coordination disorder]], evident by age ten
*Muscle weakness
*Slurred speech
*[[Scoliosis]] (curvature of the spine)
*Progressive decreased vision
*Balance and coordination problems

===Signs===
*[[Acanthocyte|Acanthocytosis]]&lt;ref name="pmid20953537" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid874076"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cooper RA|author2=Durocher JR|author3=Leslie MH |title=Decreased fluidity of red cell membrane lipids in abetalipoproteinemia |journal=J. Clin. Invest. |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=115–21 |date=July 1977 |pmid=874076 |pmc=372349 |doi=10.1172/JCI108747}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Retinitis pigmentosa]]
*[[Hypocholesterolemia]]/low blood cholesterol&lt;ref name="pmid20626336" /&gt;
===Features===
Abetalipoproteinemia affects the absorption of dietary fats, [[cholesterol]], and certain [[vitamin]]s. People affected by this disorder are not able to make certain [[lipoprotein]]s, which are [[molecule]]s that consist of [[protein]]s combined with cholesterol and particular fats called [[triglyceride]]s. This leads to a multiple vitamin deficiency, affecting the fat-soluble [[Retinol|vitamin A]], [[vitamin D]], [[Tocopherol|vitamin E]], and [[vitamin K]].&lt;ref name="titleAbetalipoproteinemia - Genetics Home Reference" /&gt; However, many of the observed effects are due to vitamin E deficiency in particular.&lt;ref name="titleAbetalipoproteinemia - Genetics Home Reference" /&gt;

[[Image:Acanthocytosis.jpg|thumb|[[Acanthocytosis]] in a patient with abetalipoproteinemia.]]
The signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia appear in the first few months of life (because pancreatic lipase is not active in this period). They can include failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate ([[failure to thrive]]); diarrhea; abnormal spiny red blood cells ([[acanthocyte|acanthocytosis]]); and fatty, foul-smelling stools ([[steatorrhea]]).&lt;ref name="titleAbetalipoproteinemia - Genetics Home Reference" /&gt; The stool may contain large chunks of fat and/or blood.  Other features of this disorder may develop later in childhood and often impair the function of the nervous system. They can include poor muscle coordination, difficulty with balance and movement ([[ataxia]]),&lt;ref name="titleAbetalipoproteinemia - Genetics Home Reference" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hentati&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hentati|first=F|author2=El-Euch, G|author3= Bouhlal, Y|author4= Amouri, R|title=Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency and abetalipoproteinemia|journal=Handbook of clinical neurology|year=2012|volume=103|pages=295–305|pmid=21827896|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-51892-7.00018-8|series=Handbook of Clinical Neurology|isbn=9780444518927}}&lt;/ref&gt; and progressive degeneration of the [[retina]] (the light-sensitive layer in the posterior eye) that can progress to near-blindness (due to deficiency of vitamin A, retinol).&lt;ref name="titleAbetalipoproteinemia - Genetics Home Reference" /&gt; Adults in their thirties or forties may have increasing difficulty with balance and walking. Many of the signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia result from a severe vitamin deficiency, especially vitamin E deficiency, which typically results in eye problems with degeneration of the spinocerebellar and dorsal column tracts.

==Genetics==

[[Image:autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Abetalipoproteinemia has an autosomal recessive pattern of [[inheritance]].]]

Mutations in the [[microsomal triglyceride transfer protein]] (MTTP) gene has been associated with this condition.&lt;ref name="titleAbetalipoproteinemia - Genetics Home Reference"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=abetalipoproteinemia |title=Abetalipoproteinemia - Genetics Home Reference |accessdate=2008-02-24 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Apolipoprotein B deficiency]], a related condition, is associated with deficiencies of [[apolipoprotein B]].)&lt;ref name="pmid22353470"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multiple functions of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein|year=2012|last1=Hussain|first1=M Mahmood|last2=Rava|first2=Paul|last3=Walsh|first3=Meghan|last4=Rana|first4=Muhammad|last5=Iqbal|first5=Jahangir|journal=Nutrition &amp; Metabolism|volume=9|pages=14|doi=10.1186/1743-7075-9-14|pmid=22353470|pmc=3337244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''MTTP'' gene provides instructions for making a protein called microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which is essential for creating beta-lipoproteins.&lt;ref name=pmid23556456&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohamed|first=N|author2=Mohamed Youssef, S|author3=Mohamed Yahia, H|author4=Afef, S|author5=Awatef, J|author6=Saber, H|author7=Mohamed Fadhel, N|author8=Sassolas, A|author9= Mohamed Naceur, S|title=Molecular characterization of Tunisian families with abetalipoproteinemia and identification of a novel mutation in MTTP gene|journal=Diagnostic pathology|date=Apr 4, 2013|volume=8|issue=1|pages=54|pmid=23556456|pmc=3632489|doi=10.1186/1746-1596-8-54}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lipoproteins are both necessary for the absorption of fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins from the diet and necessary for the efficient transport of these substances in the bloodstream.&lt;ref name=pmid23043934&gt;{{cite journal|title=Novel mutations in SAR1B and MTTP genes in Tunisian children with chylomicron retention disease and abetalipoproteinemia|year=2013|last1=Magnolo|first1=Lucia|last2=Najah|first2=Mohamed|last3=Fancello|first3=Tatiana|last4=Di Leo|first4=Enza|last5=Pinotti|first5=Elisa|last6=Brini|first6=Ines|last7=Gueddiche|first7=Neji M.|last8=Calandra|first8=Sebastiano|last9=Slimene|first9=Naceur M.|last10=Tarugi|first10=Patrizia|journal=Gene|volume=512|pages=28–34|issue=1|doi=10.1016/j.gene.2012.09.117|pmid=23043934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the mutations in this gene lead to the production of an abnormally short microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which prevents the normal creation of beta-lipoproteins in the body.&lt;ref name=pmid21394827&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pons|first1=Véronique|last2=Rolland|first2=Corinne|last3=Nauze|first3=Michel|last4=Danjoux|first4=Marie|last5=Gaibelet|first5=Gérald|last6=Durandy|first6=Anne|last7=Sassolas|first7=Agnès|last8=Lévy|first8=Emile|last9=Tercé|first9=François|last10=Collet|first10=Xavier|last11=Mas|first11=Emmanuel|title=A severe form of abetalipoproteinemia caused by new splicing mutations of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP)|journal=Human Mutation|date=July 2011|volume=32|issue=7|pages=751–9|doi=10.1002/humu.21494|pmid=21394827|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00651635/document}}&lt;/ref&gt; MTTP-associated mutations are inherited in an [[autosomal]] [[recessive]] pattern, which means both copies of the gene must be faulty to produce the disease.&lt;ref name=pmid21394827 /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The initial workup of abetalipoproteinemia typically consists of stool sampling, a blood smear, and a fasting lipid panel though these tests are not confirmatory.&lt;ref name="pmid15765527"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Demircioğlu|first=F|author2=Oren, H|author3= Yilmaz, S|author4= Arslan, N|author5= Gürcü, O|author6= Irken, G|title=Abetalipoproteinemia: importance of the peripheral blood smear.|journal=Pediatric blood &amp; cancer|date=August 2005|volume=45|issue=2|pages=237|pmid=15765527|doi=10.1002/pbc.20360}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the disease is rare, though a genetics test is necessary for diagnosis, it is generally not done initially.

[[Acanthocytes]] are seen on blood smear.&lt;ref name="pmid21534356"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ozsoylu|first=S|title=Red cells in abetalipoproteinemia.|journal=The Turkish journal of pediatrics|date=Jan–Feb 2011|volume=53|issue=1|pages=119|pmid=21534356}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since there is no or little assimilation of [[chylomicron]]s, their levels in [[Blood plasma|plasma]] remains low.

The inability to absorb fat in the ileum will result in [[steatorrhea]], or fat in the stool.  As a result, this can be clinically diagnosed when foul-smelling stool is encountered.  Low levels of plasma [[chylomicron]] are also characteristic.

There is an absence of [[apolipoprotein B]]. On intestinal [[biopsy]], [[vacuole]]s containing lipids are seen in enterocytes.  This disorder may also result in fat accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis). Because the epithelial cells of the bowel lack the ability to place fats into chylomicrons, lipids accumulate at the surface of the cell, crowding the functions that are necessary for proper absorption.

== Treatment ==

Treatment normally consists of rigorous dieting, involving massive amounts of [[vitamin E]].&lt;ref name=Hentati /&gt; Vitamin E helps the body restore and produce lipoproteins, which people with abetalipoprotenimia usually lack. Vitamin E also helps keep skin and eyes healthy; studies show that many affected males will have vision problems later on in life. Developmental coordination disorder and muscle weakness are usually treated with physiotherapy or [[occupational therapy]]. Dietary restriction of [[triglyceride]]s has also been useful.

== Prognosis ==
If treatment is initiated early in disease the neurologic sequelae may be reversed and further deterioration can be prevented.&lt;ref name="pmid8340987"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rader|first=DJ|author2=Brewer HB, Jr|title=Abetalipoproteinemia.

The arcuate nucleus includes several important and diverse populations of neurons that help mediate different neuroendocrine and physiological functions, including: neuroendocrine neurons, centrally projecting neurons, and [[astrocyte]]s. The populations of neurons found in the arcuate nucleus are based on the [[hormone]]s they secrete or interact with and are responsible for hypothalamic function, such as regulating hormones released from the [[pituitary gland]] or secreting their own hormones. Neurons in this region are also responsible for integrating information and providing inputs to other nuclei in the hypothalamus or inputs to areas outside this region of the brain. These neurons, generated from the ventral part of the periventricular epithelium during embryonic development, locate dorsally in the hypothalamus, becoming part of the ventromedial hypothalamic region.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sapru|first=Hreday N.|title=Role of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus in cardiovascular regulation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.autneu.2012.10.016|journal=Autonomic Neuroscience|volume=175|issue=1–2|pages=38–50|doi=10.1016/j.autneu.2012.10.016|pmc=3625681}}&lt;/ref&gt; The function of the arcuate nucleus relies on its diversity of neurons, but its central role is involved in [[homeostasis]]. The arcuate nucleus provides many physiological roles involved in feeding, metabolism, fertility, and cardiovascular regulation.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coppari|first=Roberto|last2=Ichinose|first2=Masumi|last3=Lee|first3=Charlotte E.|last4=Pullen|first4=Abigail E.|last5=Kenny|first5=Christopher D.|last6=McGovern|first6=Robert A.|last7=Tang|first7=Vinsee|last8=Liu|first8=Shun M.|last9=Ludwig|first9=Thomas|title=The hypothalamic arcuate nucleus: A key site for mediating leptin’s effects on glucose homeostasis and locomotor activity|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1550413104000105|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=1|issue=1|pages=63–72|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2004.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cell populations==

===Neuroendocrine neurons===
Different groups of arcuate nucleus neuroendocrine neurons secrete various types or combinations of [[neurotransmitter]]s and [[neuropeptide]]s, such as [[neuropeptide Y]] (NPY), [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH), [[agouti-related peptide]] (AgRP), [[cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript]] (CART), [[kisspeptin]], [[dopamine]], [[substance P]], [[growth hormone–releasing hormone]] (GHRH), [[neurokinin B]] (NKB), [[β-endorphin]], [[melanocyte-stimulating hormone]] (MSH), and [[somatostatin]]. [[Proopiomelanocortin]] (POMC) is a precursor [[polypeptide]] that is cleaved into MSH, ACTH, and β-endorphin and expressed in the arcuate nucleus.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;

Groups of [[Neuroendocrinology|neuroendocrine]] neurons include:
* '''TIDA neurons''', or [[Tuberoinfundibular pathway|tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurons]], are neurons that regulate the secretion of [[prolactin]] from the pituitary gland and release the neurotransmitter [[dopamine]]. TIDA neurons have nerve endings in the [[median eminence]] that release [[dopamine]] into the [[Hypophyseal portal system|hypophysial portal blood]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Voogt|first=J. L.|last2=Lee|first2=Y.|last3=Yang|first3=S.|last4=Arbogast|first4=L.|date=2001-01-01|title=Regulation of prolactin secretion during pregnancy and lactation|journal=Progress in Brain Research|volume=133|pages=173–185|issn=0079-6123|pmid=11589129|doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(01)33013-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In lactating females, TIDA neurons are inhibited by the stimulus of suckling. Dopamine released from their nerve endings at the median eminence is transported to the [[anterior pituitary gland]], where it regulates the secretion of [[prolactin]].  Dopamine inhibits prolactin secretion, so when the TIDA neurons are inhibited, there is increased secretion of prolactin, which stimulates [[lactogenesis]] (milk production). Prolactin acts in a short-loop negative feedback manner to decrease its levels by stimulating the release of dopamine. Dopaminergic neurons of the arcuate also inhibit the release of [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]], explaining in part why lactating (or otherwise [[hyperprolactinemia|hyperprolactinemic]]) women experience oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea (infrequency or absence of menses).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''[[KNDy neuron|Kisspeptin/NKB neurons]]''' within the arcuate nucleus form synaptic inputs with TIDA neurons. These neurons express [[estrogen receptor]]s and also coexpress neurokinin B in female rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sawai|first=Nobuhiko|last2=Iijima|first2=Norio|last3=Takumi|first3=Ken|last4=Matsumoto|first4=Keisuke|last5=Ozawa|first5=Hitoshi|date=2012-09-01|title=Immunofluorescent histochemical and ultrastructural studies on the innervation of kisspeptin/neurokinin B neurons to tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons in the arcuate nucleus of rats|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168010212001150|journal=Neuroscience Research|volume=74|issue=1|pages=10–16|doi=10.1016/j.neures.2012.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''GHRH neurons''' help to control [[growth hormone]] (GH) secretion in conjunction with somatostatin and NPY.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mano-Otagiri|first=Asuka|last2=Nemoto|first2=Takahiro|last3=Sekino|first3=Azusa|last4=Yamauchi|first4=Naoko|last5=Shuto|first5=Yujin|last6=Sugihara|first6=Hitoshi|last7=Oikawa|first7=Shinichi|last8=Shibasaki|first8=Tamotsu|date=2006-09-01|title=Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone (GHRH) Neurons in the Arcuate Nucleus (Arc) of the Hypothalamus Are Decreased in Transgenic Rats Whose Expression of Ghrelin Receptor Is Attenuated: Evidence that Ghrelin Receptor Is Involved in the Up-Regulation of GHRH Expression in the Arc|url=http://press.endocrine.org/doi/10.1210/en.2005-1619|journal=Endocrinology|volume=147|issue=9|pages=4093–4103|doi=10.1210/en.2005-1619|issn=0013-7227}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''NPY/AgRP neurons''' and '''POMC/CART neurons''' make up two groups of neurons in the arcuate nucleus that are centrally involved in the neuroendocrine function of feeding. Medial neurons utilize NPY peptides as neurotransmitters to stimulate appetite, and lateral neurons utilize POMC/CART to inhibit appetite.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt; NPY and POMC/CART neurons are sensitive to peripheral hormones such as leptin and insulin.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;  POMC/CART neurons also secrete [[melanocyte-stimulating hormone]], which suppresses appetite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baltatzi|first1=M|last2=Hatzitolios|first2=A|last3=Tziomalos|first3=K|last4=Iliadis|first4=F|last5=Zamboulis|first5=Ch|title=Neuropeptide Y and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone: interaction in obesity and possible role in the development of hypertension.|journal=International Journal of Clinical Practice|date=September 2008|volume=62|issue=9|pages=1432–40|doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2008.01823.x|pmid=18793378}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carlons2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlson|first1=Neil R.|title=Physiology of Behavior Books a La Carte Edition.|date=2012|publisher=Pearson College Div|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-205-23981-8|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|419}}
* '''GnRH neurons''' have also been found.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt; These neurons secrete GnRH and [[histamine]].&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;
* There are also groups of neurons expressing NKB and [[dynorphin]] that help to control reproduction.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;

===Centrally-projecting neurons===
Other types of neurons have projection pathways from the arcuate nucleus to mediate different regions of the hypothalamus or to other regions outside of the hypothalamus.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;  Projections of these neurons extend a long distance from the arcuate nucleus to the median eminence to influence the release of hormones from the pituitary gland.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;  Neurons of the arcuate nucleus have intrahypothalamic projections for neuroendrocrine circuitry.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  such as neural projections that influence feeding behavior project to the [[Paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus|paraventricular nucleus]] of the hypothalamus (PVH), the [[dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus]] (DMH, and the [[lateral hypothalamic area]] (LHA).&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Populations of neurons connect to the intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland, from the lateral division of the ARH to the neural and intermediate parts of the pituitary gland, and the caudal division of ARH to the median eminence.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;

Groups of neurons that project elsewhere within the [[central nervous system]] include:
* Centrally projecting neurons that contain [[neuropeptide Y]] (NPY), [[agouti-related protein]] (AGRP), and the inhibitory neurotransmitter [[GABA]]. These neurons, in the most ventromedial part of the nucleus, project strongly to the [[lateral hypothalamus]] and to the [[paraventricular nucleus]] of the hypothalamus, and are important in the regulation of [[appetite]]. When activated, these neurons can produce ravenous eating. These neurons are inhibited by [[leptin]], [[insulin]], and [[peptide YY]] and activated by [[ghrelin]].
* Centrally projecting neurons that contain [[peptide]] products of [[pro-opiomelanocortin]] (POMC), and [[cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript]] (CART). These neurons have widespread projections to many brain areas, including to all nuclei in the hypothalamus. These cells are important in the regulation of [[appetite]], and, when activated, they inhibit feeding. These neurons are activated by circulating concentrations of [[leptin]] and [[insulin]], and they are directly innervated and inhibited by the NPY neurons.&lt;ref&gt;Arora and Anubhuti. Role of neuropeptides in appetite regulation and obesity--a review. Neuropeptides (2006) vol. 40 (6) pp. 375-401&lt;/ref&gt; POMC neurons that project to the medial preoptic nucleus are also involved in the regulation of [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] in both males and females.  The expression of POMC is regulated by gonadal steroids.  The release of a POMC product, beta-endorphin is regulated by NPY.
* Centrally projecting neurons that make somatostatin; the neurosecretory somatostatin neurons that regulate growth hormone secretion are a different population, located in the periventricular nucleus.
* Feeding regulatory neurons also activate oxytocin-containing neurons of the [[periventricular nucleus]] (PVN), which projects to nucleus of [[Tractus solitarius]] in the [[medulla oblongata]].&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;
* Others receive direct synaptic inputs from extra hypothalamic sites projecting into the [[amygdala]], the [[hippocampus]], and the [[entorhinal cortex]].&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;

===Other neurons ===
Other cell populations include:
* A small population of neurons that sensitive to [[ghrelin]]. The role of this population is not known; many neurons in the arcuate nucleus express receptors for ghrelin, but these are thought to respond mainly to blood-borne ghrelin.
* The arcuate nucleus also contains a population of specialized [[ependymal cells]], called [[tanycytes]].
* Astrocytes in the arcuate nucleus hold high capacity glucose transporters that function as nutrient sensors for appetite controlling neurons&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt; 
* The diverse and specialized collections of neurons reside within a special compartment with [[glial cells]] and have their own network of [[Capillary|capillaries]] and a membrane of [[tanycyte]]s that help create a blood brain barrier.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt; Circulating or molecules such as hormones travel in the blood and can directly affect these neurons and their plasticity as evidence by adult neurogenesis.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;

They measured how susceptible patients were to [[Hypnosis|hypnotic induction]].  One result of their research was showing that the hypnotic induction was not superior to motivational instructions in producing a heightened state of suggestibility.&lt;ref name="Pearce2005-09-23" /&gt; The Barber Suggestibility Scale, a product of their research, measures [[hypnotic susceptibility]] with or without the use of a hypnotic induction.&lt;ref name="Pearce2005-09-23" /&gt;

SunSentinel.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued in this work that [[hypnosis]] and related constructs are "unnecessary and misleading and that the phenomena that have been traditionally subsumed under these terms can be better understood by utilizing a different set of concepts that are an integral part of present-day psychology."&lt;ref&gt;Hilgard, Ernest R. (1970). ''Barber, Theodore X. Hypnosis: A Scientific Approach''.

''Anesthesia Progress'' 18: 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Theodore R. Sarbin]] noted that the work "demystifies and demythologizes" the subject, "the construction of hypnosis as a special mental state ha[s] no ontological footing."&lt;ref&gt;Sarbin, Theodore R. (1997). Barber, Theodore X. (1995/1969). ''Hypnosis: A Scientific Approach''. ''[[American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis]]'' 39: 225-227.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barber was a fellow of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/in-memoriam_segment_from_csicon_2016 "In-Memoriam Segment from CSICON 2016"].

States are given flexibility in designing their CHIP eligibility requirements and policies within broad federal guidelines. Some states have received authority through waivers of statutory provisions to use CHIP funds to cover the parents of children receiving benefits from both CHIP and Medicaid, [[pregnant]] women, and other adults. CHIP covered 7.6 million children during federal fiscal year 2010, and every state has an approved plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Childrens-Health-Insurance-Program-CHIP/Downloads/2010_enrollment_datapdf.pdf |title=FY 2010 Number of Children Ever Enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP |accessdate=2013-04-03 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite CHIP, the number of uninsured children continued to rise, particularly among families that cannot qualify for CHIP. An October 2007 study by the Vimo Research Group found that 68.7 percent of newly uninsured children were in families whose incomes were 200 percent of the [[Poverty in the United States|federal poverty level]] or higher as more employers dropped dependents or dropped coverage altogether due to annual premiums nearly doubling between 2000 and 2006. Vimo cites the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured when it says 48 percent of the newly uninsured were not eligible for any kind of public coverage, and that only those in the lowest income bracket might offset the loss of employer-sponsored coverage with increases in Medicaid and SCHIP.&lt;ref name="Uninsured In America"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vimo.com/reports/uninsured.pdf |title=The Uninsured In America |accessdate=2008-01-06 |last=Espe |first=Erik |date=October 2007 |format=PDF |publisher=Vimo Research Group |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627024709/http://www.vimo.com/reports/uninsured.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-27 |df= }} Obtain a .&lt;/ref&gt; In FY 2008, the program faced funding shortfalls in several states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/medicaid/upload/7635.pdf |title=President's FY 2008 Budget and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) |accessdate=2007-07-03 |format=PDF |work=Henry J.

Two attempts to expand funding for the program were vetoed by President [[George W. Bush]], who argued that such efforts were steps toward federalization of health care, and would "steer the program away from its core purpose of providing insurance for poor children and toward covering children from middle-class families."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/03/washington/03cnd-veto.html|author1=David Stout |title=Bush Vetoes Children's Health Bill |work=The New York Times| accessdate=2009-01-08 | date=2007-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 4, 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] signed the Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act of 2009, expanding the healthcare program to an additional 4 million children and pregnant women, including  “lawfully residing” immigrants without a waiting period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nilc.org/ICHIA-facts-2010-08-06.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618171105/http://www.nilc.org/ICHIA-facts-2010-08-06.html |archivedate=2012-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 survey of the existing research noted that the availability of "CHIP coverage for children has led to improvements in access to health care and to improvements in health over both the short-run and the long-run."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://econofact.org/filling-in-the-gap-of-childrens-health-insurance-coverage-medicaid-and-chip|title=CHIP and Medicaid: Filling in the Gap in Children's Health Insurance Coverage. {{!}} Econofact|date=2018-01-22|work=Econofact|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{hus}}
The Children's Health Insurance Program grew out of years of work in the [[U.S. Congress]] to improve Americans' health coverage. Almost a decade prior, the [[U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care]] was formed in 1989 and charged with recommending “legislative action to ensure coverage for all Americans.” The Commission, renamed the Pepper Commission in honor of its creator and first chair Representative Claude Pepper (D-Fla.), laid out a blueprint to achieve universal coverage. Given the challenges of comprehensive health reform, Governor [[Jay Rockefeller]], who was elected chair following Rep. Pepper's death, emphasized his commitment to pursue legislative action not only on the commission's full set of recommendations but also on a "down payment" — to expand public health coverage immediately for children and pregnant women, consistent with the principles the commission put forward. The legislation would guarantee public insurance coverage through Medicaid for every American child living in poverty and offset the cost of the improvements by doubling the federal excise tax on cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rockefeller|first1=John|title=The Pepper Commission Report on Comprehensive Health Care|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=October 4, 1990|doi=10.1056/NEJM199010043231429|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199010043231429#t=article|accessdate=6 September 2017}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quickly after his election in 1992, President [[Bill Clinton]] assembled a task force to write a comprehensive health reform bill, and he worked with Congress to introduce the Health Security Act (HSA) in November 1993. It included provisions such as universal coverage and a basic benefit package, health insurance reform, and consumer choice of health plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Plaut|first1=TF|last2=Arons|first2=BS|title=President Clinton's proposal for health care reform: key provisions and issues|journal=Hosp Community Psychiatry|date=September 1994|volume=45|issue=9|pages=871–876|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the HSA failed in the fall of 1994, congressional leaders and the administration recognized the need for an incremental, bipartisan approach to health care reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: IN THEIR OWN WORDS; Why Health Care Fizzled: Too Little Time and Too Much Politics|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/27/us/health-care-debate-their-own-words-why-health-care-fizzled-too-little-time-too.html|accessdate=6 September 2017|agency=The New York Times|date=September 27, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Jay Rockefeller]] continued to argue for expanded coverage for children. He referenced an amendment for accelerated coverage children and pregnant women offered during the Senate Finance Committee’s health care reform markup that was adopted by a bipartisan majority of 12 to 8 as evidence that there was bipartisan support to provide assistance to children. He also went on to say expanding coverage for children was essential to reforming the welfare system to “prevent families from having to go and off welfare to qualify for Medicaid.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rockefeller|first1=John D.|title=Moving Ahead With Health Care System Reform|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=18 January 1995|volume=273|issue=3|pages=250|doi=10.1001/jama.1995.03520270086044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1996 Bipartisan Budget Agreement made net reductions in federal Medicaid spending over a five-year period but anticipated an additional $16 billion in spending on children's health care over the same period. However, it did not provide details on how that money would be spent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medicaid and Child Health Provisions  of the Bipartisan Budget Agreement|url=https://www.cbpp.org/archives/mcaidbud.htm|website=Center on Budget and Policy Priorities|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, several members of Congress introduced bills to cover uninsured children using that $16 billion, and the two most popular proposals were the Chafee-Rockefeller proposal and the Kennedy-Hatch proposal.

Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) was intrigued by a children's health insurance plan in Massachusetts that had passed in 1996, and met with a [[Boston Medical Center]] pediatrics director and a [[Massachusetts state legislator]] to discuss the feasibility of a national initiative.&lt;ref name="bg031408"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/03/14/clinton_role_in_health_program_disputed/?page=full | title=Clinton role in health program disputed | author=Susan Milligan | work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=2008-03-14 | accessdate=2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy also saw using an increase in [[sin tax|tobacco taxes]] as a way to pay for the expanded coverage.&lt;ref name="bg031408"/&gt;  Thus, in October 1996, Kennedy introduced a bill to provide health care coverage for children of the working poor, to be financed via a 75 cents a pack cigarette tax increase.&lt;ref name="time031308"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1721966,00.html | title=Assessing Clinton's "Experience": Children's Health Care |author1=Karen Tumulty |author2=Michael Duffy |author3=Massimo Calabresi |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=2008-03-13 | accessdate=2008-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy brought Republican Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] onto the legislation as a co-sponsor. Kennedy and Hatch had worked together as an "odd couple" in the Senate before, and here Hatch said that "Children are being terribly hurt and perhaps scarred for the rest of their lives" and that "as a nation, as a society, we have a moral responsibility" to provide coverage. Hatch's role would infuriate some Republican colleagues and conservative commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pear|first1=Robert|title=Hatch Joins Kennedy to Back a Health Program|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/14/us/hatch-joins-kennedy-to-back-a-health-program.html?mcubz=0|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 8, 1997, Senators Kennedy and Hatch introduced S. 525, the “Child Health Insurance and Lower Deficit Act (CHILD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S.525 - Child Health Insurance and Lower Deficit Act|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/senate-bill/525?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22S.+525%5C%22Child+Health+Insurance+and+Lower+Deficit+Act%5C%22%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1|website=Congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legislation amended the Public Health Service Act to create a new grant program for states to purchase private health insurance for children. It proposed to raise $30 billion over 5 years by raising the tobacco tax with $20 billion going to expanded coverage for children under a block grant approach and $10 billion for deficit reduction. S. 525 was referred to the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee. Hearings were held on the bill in the HELP Committee but legislation to expand coverage for children was never acted on in the HELP Committee.

On April 30, 1997, Senators [[John Chafee]] (R-RI) and [[Jay Rockefeller]] (D-WVa.) introduced S. 674, a bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act “to expand health coverage of low income children and pregnant women and to provide funds to promote outreach efforts to enroll eligible children.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children's Health Insurance Provides Security (CHIPS) Act|url=https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/5/1/senate-section/article/s3926-2?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22children%27s+health+rockefeller%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1|website=The Congressional Record}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, Representative [[John Dingell]] (D-MI) introduced an identical bipartisan companion bill in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] with Republican cosponsor, Representative Margaret Scafati Roukema (R-NJ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Children’s Health Insurance Provides Security (CHIPS) Act (H.R 1491)|journal=The Congressional Record|date=April 30, 1997|volume=143|issue=54|page=H2089|url=https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/30/house-section/article/H2089-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in December 1996 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton examined several possible initiatives and decided expanding health care insurance to children who had none was the one to advance,&lt;ref name="ap100507"/&gt; especially as its focus on children would be politically popular.&lt;ref name="time031308"/&gt; This had precedents from earlier in the Clinton administration: a different variant of this approach, dubbed "Kids First", had been envisioned as a backup plan during the original 1993 Task Force on National Health Care Reform meetings.&lt;ref name="fc031808"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/giving_hillary_credit_for_schip.html | title=Giving Hillary Credit for SCHIP | author=Brooks Jackson | publisher=[[FactCheck.org]] | date=2008-03-18 | accessdate=2008-03-19 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322032750/http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/giving_hillary_credit_for_schip.html | archivedate=2008-03-22 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.aapsonline.org/newsletters/jan96.htm | title=Clinton Care Through the Kitchen Door | publisher=[[Association of American Physicians and Surgeons]] | date=January 1996 | accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Hillary Clinton had discussed an SCHIP-like program with a White House health policy coordinator during the time her full-blown health care plan had suffered political failure.&lt;ref name="wapo032408"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/23/AR2008032301706.html?sid=ST2008032401106 | title=Both Obama And Clinton Embellish Their Roles | author=Shailagh Murray | author2= Jonathan Weisman | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=2008-03-24 | accessdate=2008-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An  initial objection of Republicans in the Senate was that proposing to pay for the services by raising the federal tax on cigarettes, from 24 cents a pack to 67 cents a pack, ignored the likely consequence that sale of tobacco products would decrease and tax revenues would increasingly fall short of those needed to pay for the expansion of benefits.&lt;ref name="nyt052197"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/21/us/child-insurance-bill-opposed-as-threat-to-cigarette-revenue.html | title= Child Insurance Bill Opposed As Threat to Cigarette Revenue | author=[[Adam Clymer]] | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=1997-05-21 | accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy and Hatch scoffed at the objection, with the former saying, "If we can keep people healthy and stop them from dying, I think most Americans would say 'Amen; isn't that a great result?' If fewer people smoke, states will save far more in lower health costs than they will lose in revenues from the cigarette tax."&lt;ref name="nyt052197"/&gt;  Republicans also criticized the bill as an open-ended [[entitlement program]], although it was structured as a [[block grant]] rather than an entitlement;&lt;ref name="nyt052197"/&gt; Senate Majority Leader [[Trent Lott]] was an early opponent of the measure, calling it a "big-government program" that would not pass.&lt;ref name="time042197"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986210,00.html | title=Hatching Mischief | author=James Carney | publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=1997-04-21 | accessdate=2008-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then the bill had to comply with the existing balanced budget agreement between Congress and the White House, something that Lott said it did not.&lt;ref name="ap100507"/&gt;  Pressure was on to reduce the amount of grants involved, with $16 billion a possible compromise; Hillary Clinton instead argued for $24 billion.&lt;ref name="ap100507"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fc031808"/&gt;  The Clinton administration had a deal with the Republican leadership in Congress that forbade the administration from backing any amendments to the budget resolution.&lt;ref name="bg031408"/&gt;  Thus, Bill Clinton phoned members of Congress and asked that they kill the children's health insurance provision when it came to the floor.&lt;ref name="ap100507"/&gt;  On May 22, it was so done, with the necessary cigarette tax amendment defeated by a 55–45 margin.&lt;ref name="nyt052297"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/22/us/clinton-helps-kill-proposal-to-raise-tax-on-cigarettes.html | title=Clinton Helps Kill Proposal to Raise Tax on Cigarettes | author=[[Adam Clymer]] | date=1997-05-22 | accessdate=2008-03-17 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hillary Clinton defended her husband's action at the time, saying "He had to safeguard the overall budget proposal,"&lt;ref name="ap100507"/&gt; but Kennedy was surprised and angered by it,&lt;ref name="bg031408"/&gt; considering it a betrayal,&lt;ref name="time031308"/&gt; and saying that his calls to Bill Clinton and Vice President [[Al Gore]] had not been returned.&lt;ref name="nyt052297"/&gt;  Hatch was also upset, saying that Lott may have been bluffing and that, "I think the President and the people in the White House caved here."&lt;ref name="nyt052297"/&gt;

Kennedy did not give up on the measure, saying: "We shall offer it again and again until we prevail. It's more important to protect children than to protect the tobacco industry."&lt;ref name="nyt052297"/&gt;  Both Bill and Hillary Clinton argued for including the children's health insurance in subsequent legislation.&lt;ref name="bg031408"/&gt;  The bill was indeed revived by Kennedy and Hatch a month after its initial defeat.&lt;ref name="time031308"/&gt;  Organizations from the [[Children's Defense Fund]] to the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] lobbied for its passage, putting public pressure on Congress;&lt;ref name="time031308"/&gt;  Hillary Clinton was pushing for it as well,&lt;ref name="ap100507"/&gt; with Kennedy urging her to use her influence within the White House.&lt;ref name="time031308"/&gt;  SCHIP was then passed and signed into law by Bill Clinton on August 5, 1997&lt;ref name="ap100507"/&gt; as part of the [[Balanced Budget Act of 1997]], to take effect the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/21/us/states-to-give-more-children-health-coverage.html | title= States to Give More Children Health Coverage | author=Peter T.

SCHIP is located at Title IV, subtitle J of  H.R. 2015 [105th]  [[Balanced Budget Act of 1997]].

On the same day, the bill passed in the Senate, with a substitute amendment, by unanimous consent.  After a conference between the House and Senate, passage in both House (Roll #345: 346-85) and Senate (Roll #209: 85-15) on the conference substitute became more bipartisan.

Like Medicaid, SCHIP is a partnership between federal and state governments. The programs are run by the individual states according to requirements set by the federal [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]]. States may design their SCHIP programs as an independent program separate from Medicaid (separate child health programs), use SCHIP funds to expand their Medicaid program (SCHIP Medicaid expansion programs), or combine these approaches (SCHIP combination programs). States receive enhanced federal funds for their SCHIP programs at a rate above the regular Medicaid match.

By February 1999, 47 states had set up SCHIP programs, but it took effort to get children enrolled.&lt;ref name="fc031808"/&gt;  That month, the Clinton administration launched the "Insure Kids Now" campaign, designed to get more children enrolled;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.clintonfoundation.org/legacy/022399-fact-sheet-on-insure-kids-now-campaign.htm | title=President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton Launch the [Insure Kids Now Campaign]http://www.insurekidsnow.gov Promoting Children's Health Insurance Outreach | date=1999-02-23 | accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the campaign would fall under the aegis of the [[Health Resources and Services Administration]].  By April 1999, some 1 million children had been enrolled, and the Clinton administration set a goal of raising the figure to 2.5 million by 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.clintonpresidentialcenter.org/legacy/042099-hrc-announces-child-health-insurance-enrollment.htm | title=First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton Announces That Almost One Million Children Are Enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program | date=1999-04-20 | accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

States with separate child health programs follow the regulations described in Section 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Section 457. Separate child health programs have much more flexibility than Medicaid programs. Separate programs can impose cost sharing, tailor their benefit packages, and employ a great deal of flexibility in eligibility and enrollment matters. The limits to this flexibility are described in the regulations, and states must describe their program characteristics in their SCHIP state plans. Out of 50 state governors, 43 support SCHIP renewal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/10/schip_numbers.html Overriding the SCHIP Veto by the Numbers]  Center for American Progress.&lt;/ref&gt; Some states have incorporated the use of private companies to administer portions of their SCHIP benefits. These programs, typically referred to as [[Medicaid managed care]], allow private insurance companies or health maintenance organizations to contract directly with a state Medicaid department at a fixed price per enrollee. The health plans then enroll eligible individuals into their programs and become responsible for assuring SCHIP benefits are delivered to eligible beneficiaries.

In [[Ohio]], SCHIP funds are used to expand eligibility for the state's Medicaid program. Thus all Medicaid rules and regulations (including cost sharing and benefits) apply. Children from birth through age 18 who live in families with incomes above the Medicaid thresholds in 1996 and up to 200% of the federal poverty level are eligible for the SCHIP Medicaid expansion program. In 2008, the maximum annual income needed for a family of four to fall within 100% of the federal poverty guidelines was $21,200, while 200% of the poverty guidelines was $42,400.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Register, Vol. 73, No. 15, January 23, 2008, pp. 3971-3972. Also see [http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/index.shtml "US Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states have similar SCHIP guidelines, with some states being more generous or restrictive in the number of children they allow into the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccf.georgetown.edu/index/medicaid-and-schip-programs "Medicaid and SCHIP Program Eligibility Rules by State"]&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of Alaska, Idaho, North Dakota and Oklahoma, all states have a minimum threshold for coverage at 200% of the federal poverty guidelines. North Dakota currently has the lowest at 175%. New York currently has the highest at 405% of the federal poverty guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://singlemotherguide.com/medicaid-chip-eligibility/ State Medicaid and CHIP Eligibility Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt; SCHIP Medicaid expansion programs typically use the same names for the expansion and Medicaid programs. Separate child health programs typically have different names for their programs. A few states also call the SCHIP program by the term "Children's Health Insurance Program" (CHIP).

States are allowed to use Medicaid and SCHIP funds for premium assistance programs that help eligible individuals purchase private health insurance.  As of 2008 relatively few states had premium assistance programs, and enrollment was relatively low.  Interest in this approach remained high, however.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Alker, [http://www.kff.org/medicaid/upload/7782.pdf "Choosing Premium Assistance: What Does State Experience Tell Us?"], The [[Kaiser Family Foundation]], May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, the Bush Administration announced a rule requiring states (as of August 2008) to sign up 95% of families with children earning 200% of the federal poverty level, before using the funds to serve families earning more than 250% of the federal poverty level.  The federal government said that 9 out the 17 states that offer benefits to higher-earning families were already compliant.  Opponents of this rule argued that signing up higher-income families makes lower-income families more likely to sign up, and that the rule was incompassionate toward children who would otherwise go without medical insurance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89521878 Proposal Favoring SCHIP's Poorest Kids Criticized]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, researchers from [[Brigham Young University]] and [[Arizona State University|Arizona State]] found that children who drop out of SCHIP cost states more money because they shift away from routine care to more frequent [[emergency room|emergency care]] situations.&lt;ref name="Impacts Medicaid disenrollment"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rimsza ME, Butler RJ, Johnson WG | title = Impact of Medicaid disenrollment on health care use and cost | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 119 | issue = 5 | pages = e1026–32 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17473075 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2006-2747 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17473075 | issn = | accessdate = 2008-01-05}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion of the study is that an attempt to cut the costs of a state healthcare program could create a false savings because other government organizations pick up the tab for the children who lose insurance coverage and later need care.

In a 2007 analysis by the [[Congressional Budget Office]], researchers determined that "for every 100 children who gain coverage as a result of SCHIP, there is a corresponding reduction in private coverage of between 25 and 50 children." The CBO speculates this is because the state programs offer better benefits at lower cost to enrollees than the private alternatives.&lt;ref name="CBO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/80xx/doc8092/05-10-SCHIP.pdf|title=The State Children's Health Insurance Program|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|date=2007-05-10|accessdate=2007-10-16|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A briefing paper by libertarian think-tank [[Cato Institute]] estimated the "crowding out" of private insurers by the public program could be as much as 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/bp/html/bp99/bp9900006.html|title=Sinking SCHIP: A first step toward stopping the growth of government health programs|author=Michael F. Cannon|accessdate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reauthorization ==
SCHIP was created in 1997 as a ten-year program; to continue past federal fiscal year 2007, passage of a reauthorization bill was required.  The first two reauthorization bills to pass through Congress would also expand the program's scope; President [[George W. Bush]] vetoed them as improper expansions.  A two-year reauthorization bill was signed into law by the President in December 2007 that would merely extend current SCHIP services without expanding any portion of the program.  With the 2008 Presidential and Congressional elections giving Democrats control of the Oval Office as well as expanded majorities in both houses of Congress, SCHIP was reauthorized and expanded in the same bill through fiscal year 2013.

===2007 reauthorization===

====HR 976====
In 2007, both houses of Congress passed a bipartisan measure to expand the SCHIP program, {{USBill|110|H.R.|976}}. The measure would have expanded coverage to over 4 million more participants by 2012, while phasing out most state expansions in the program that include any adults other than pregnant women. The bill called for a budget increase for five years totaling $35 billion, increasing total SCHIP spending to $60 billion for the five-year period. Opposition to HR 976 focused on the $35 billion increase in government health insurance as well as $6.5 billion in Medicaid benefits to illegal immigrants. Originally intended to provide health care coverage to low-income children, HR 976 was criticized as a giveaway that would have benefited adults as well as non-U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aderholt.house.gov/?sectionid=20&amp;sectiontree=6,20&amp;itemid=649 Congressman Robert B.

On October 3, 2007, President Bush vetoed the bill,&lt;ref name="Bush Veto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21111931/ |title=''Bush vetoes child health insurance plan'' |accessdate=2007-10-03 |format=webpage |publisher=''MSNBC''}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that he believed it would "federalize health care", expanding the scope of SCHIP much farther than its original intent.&lt;ref name="Washington Post Veto page"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/03/AR2007100300116.html?hpid=topnews |title=''Bush Vetoes Children's Health Insurance Plan'' |last=Abramowitz |first=Michael |date=2007-10-03 |publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/09/20070928-9.html |title=Excerpt of President's Radio Address on SCHIP Legislation |date=September 28, 2007 |publisher=White House}}&lt;/ref&gt; The veto was the fourth of his administration.&lt;ref name="Washington Post Veto page" /&gt; After his veto, Bush said he was open to a compromise that would entail more than the $5 billion originally budgeted, but would not agree to any proposal drastically expanding the number of children eligible for coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Stolberg | first =Sheryl Gay |author2=Carl Hulse  | title =Bush Vetoes Child Health Bill Privately | work=The New York Times | date =2007-10-04 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/04/washington/04bush.html?_r=1&amp;th=&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;emc=th&amp;adxnnlx=1191499205-V0SMbWtwnr6woUuLB3vhZA   | accessdate =2007-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2007, the House of Representatives fell 13 votes short (273–156) of the two-thirds majority required to override the president's veto, although 44 Republicans joined 229 Democrats in supporting the measure.&lt;ref name="House override attempt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll982.xml |title=Final Vote Results for Roll Call 982 |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives |accessdate=2007-10-18 |format=webpage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====HR 3963====
Within a week of the failed veto override vote, the House passed a second bill attempting a similar expansion of SCHIP. According to Democrats, the second bill, {{USBill|110|H.R.|3963}}, created firmer caps on income eligibility, prevented adults from joining, and banned children of illegal immigrants from receiving benefits. According to its opponents, however, this second proposed expansion was for families with annual incomes up to $62,000 (300 percent of the federal poverty level).&lt;ref name="Citizen Feb 2009 Game Plan" /&gt; The Senate passed the measure on November 1, 2007, but on December 12, 2007, Bush vetoed this bill as well, saying it was "essentially identical" to the earlier legislation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=President Bush vetoes child health bill again|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/12/12/bush.schip/?iref=mpstoryview|work= |publisher=CNN |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2007-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a House vote in January 2008 failed to override the veto.

=== 2009 reauthorization ===
[[File:Dingell joins Obama in signing of the re-issuing of CHIP.jpg|thumb|right|Signing ceremony for the reauthorization]]
In the wake of President [[Barack Obama]]'s inauguration and the Democrats' increased majorities in both houses of Congress, legislative leaders moved quickly to break the political stalemate over SCHIP expansion. On January 14, 2009, the House passed {{USBill|111|H.R.|2}} on a vote of 290-138. The bill authorized spending and added $32.8 billion to expand the health coverage program to include about 4 million more children, including coverage of legal immigrants&lt;ref name="NYTimes.com"/&gt; with no waiting period for the first time. A cigarette tax increase of 62 cents—bringing the total tax on a pack of cigarettes to $1.01—an increase of tax on chewing tobacco from $0.195/lb. to $0.50/lb.—as well as tax increases on other tobacco products&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/021009/page2 |title=Health Groups Hail Increase in Federal Tobacco Taxes |accessdate=2009-02-10 |work=NCI Cancer Bulletin |publisher=National Cancer Institute |date=February 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217235457/http://www.cancer.gov/ncicancerbulletin/021009/page2 |archivedate=February 17, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed as a funding source for the program's expansion.

{{Orphan|date=October 2015}}

'''Corvalol''' ('''Корвалол''', '''Corvalolum''', '''Korvalol''') is a mild tranquilizer based on [[valerian (herb)]] root and [[phenobarbital]], popular in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union as a heart medication. It is available as a transparent liquid with a characteristic strong aroma, and as white bi-concave scored tablets. While not available for sale in the Western countries, Corvalol is sometimes brought over from Eastern Europe for self-administration to other countries of residence. Corvalol contains documented amounts of psychoactive chemicals, and may interact with other prescription medications that a person is taking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ru.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Корвалол&amp;stable=1 Wikipedia.ru. "Корвалол".]{{Better source|date=January 2017|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical uses ==
Corvalol is labeled by the manufacturer for use in
* Neuroses with heightened irritability
* [[Insomnia]]
* As a part of complex treatment of [[hypertension]]
* Non-acute spasm of coronary vessels
* [[Tachycardia]]
* Gastrointestinal cramping (as a spasmolytic agent)

=== Valerian Extract ===
[[Valerian (herb)]] extract (a component of corvalol) has been historically used for insomnia and conditions associated with anxiety. It has also been used for mood disorders such as depression, infantile convulsions, mild tremors, epilepsy, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] (CFS). Additional historical uses include to help alleviate muscle and joint pain, nervous asthma, hysterical states, excitability, hypochondria, headaches, migraine, menstrual cramps and symptoms associated with menopause, including hot flashes and anxiety. However, few of these indications are supported by clinical trials in humans.&lt;ref&gt;Natural Standard. The Authority on Integrative Medicine. "Valerian". https://naturalmedicines.therapeuticresearch.com/databases/food,-herbs-supplements/professional.aspx?productid=870&lt;/ref&gt;
Taking a combination product containing valerian extract plus hops extract has been shown to modestly improve subjective sleep measures including subjective sleep latency compared to placebo after 28 days of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morin | first1 = CM | display-authors = etal   | year = | title = Valerian-hops combination and diphenhydramine for treating insomnia: a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial | url = | journal = Sleep | volume = 2005 | issue = 11| pages = 1465–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is evidence in limited animal trials that valerian root may reduce coronary vessel spasm, such as one that may occur in an attack of [[vasospastic angina]] or [[angina pectoris]]. The same study demonstrated that valerian may reduce bronchospasm in animals after administration of bronchospastic agents. These studies justify the traditional use of this plant in the treatment of some respiratory and cardiovascular disorders.

=== Phenobarbital ===
[[Phenobarbital]] is a barbiturate anticonvulsant used in epilepsy and to induce sedation. Currently there is no evidence to support the use of phenobarbital in cardiovascular or bronchospastic disease states.

== Safety ==
Due to lack of scientific evidence supported by randomized clinical trials in humans, Corvalol and its components should be used with caution in patients with serious cardiovascular conditions, such as [[hypertension]], [[angina]], or respiratory conditions such as [[asthma]]. Prescription medications that have been scientifically proved to be effective in these disease states should be preferred due to evidence supporting their clinical use.

According to the American Geriatrics Society, [[phenobarbital]] should not be used in the elderly population due to high rate of physical dependence, tolerance to sleep benefits, and the risk of overdose at low dosages.&lt;ref&gt;American Geriatrics Society updated Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older Adults. The American Geriatrics Society 2012 Beers Criteria Update Expert Panel.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the manufacturer, overdose is possible due to accumulation of the ingredients when Corvalol is used frequently and in large doses. Symptoms of overdose include [[central nervous system]] depression, confusion, dizziness, [[ataxia]], and [[somnolence]]. In serious cases overdose may result in breathing depression, [[tachycardia]], [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]], [[hypotension]] (low blood pressure), cardiovascular collapse, and coma.

== Drug interactions ==
Phenobarbital is a strong [[inducer]] (activator) of several hepatic [[cytochrome P450]] enzymes, including [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP3A4]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11996099 | volume=47 | title=Phenobarbital-induced expression of cytochrome P450 genes | year=2000 | journal=Acta Biochim. Pol. | pages=1093–105 | last1 = Czekaj | first1 = P}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the functions of these enzymes is to change the molecular structure of medications and other substances taken in by the human body. Taking phenobarbital-containing products, such as Corvalol, while taking other medications may reduce their effectiveness. Some of the medications that may have decreased effectiveness when used with Corvalol are [[apixaban]], [[rivaroxaban]], [[clozapine]], [[itraconazole]], [[nifedipine]], biologics, and many others.
Corvalol may increase CNS depressant effect of other sedatives and hypnotics.

== Pharmaceutical category ==
Corvalol belongs to the sedative-hypnotic category.&lt;ref&gt;Фармак. "Корвалол (таблетки)". http://farmak.ua/ru/drugs/182&lt;/ref&gt;
Valerianate component of the preparation is purported to offer mild spasmolytic effects on the [[vasculature]]. Phenobarbital is a [[central nervous system]] depressant.

== Composition ==

According to the Farmak product label, the composition of 1 tablet is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corvalol (tablets) Prescribing Information|url=http://farmak.ua/assets_images/drugs/instruction/ru/182/Корвалол_табл_рус.pdf|publisher=PAO "Farmak"|accessdate=14 December 2015|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inactive ingredients: [[lactose]] monohydrate, [[magnesium stearate]], β-[[cyclodextrin]], [[acesulfame potassium]].

== Legal status ==
Phenobarbital, one of the principal ingredients in Corvalol, is a DEA Schedule IV substance in the United States. Schedule IV substances have a low potential for abuse relative to substances in Schedules I–III. Examples of Schedule IV substances are alprazolam (Xanax), carisoprodol (Soma), clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium) and others.&lt;ref&gt;U/S/ Department of Justice. Drug Enforcement Administration. Office of Diversion Control. "Controlled Substances Schedules"  http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/&lt;/ref&gt; It is illegal to import Corvalol into United States (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20060522212854/http://depts.washington.edu/druginfo/Alerts/Details/corvalolum.html Health Hazard with Unapproved Imported Drug from Russia] )

In some countries of Eastern Europe, Corvalol is believed to be safe enough to use in recommended doses without prescription. It is widely used to treat [[elevated blood pressure]] and as a general-purpose tranquilizer/sedative. Despite the -lol suffix, the drug is not a [[beta-blocker]]. Corvalol is so common in Eastern Europe that, in 1996, the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation included it in the list of mandatory items in all Russian passenger vehicle first aid kits, alongside such drugs as [[aspirin]], [[Metamizole|metamizole sodium (branded Analgin)]], [[nitroglycerin]], and [[activated charcoal]].

== Manufacturer ==
Corvalol was produced by Kiev Chemical and Pharmaceutical Plant in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]] in 1960-1991, and by its successor, the Joint Stock Company "Farmak", from 1991 onward. Farmak currently owns the exclusive trade mark to the drug name in Ukraine and a number of countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, but not in Russia, where Corvalol is available from a number of different drug companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=[Russian] State Register of Medicines: Corvalol|url=http://grls.rosminzdrav.ru/GRLS.aspx?RegNumber=&amp;MnnR=&amp;lf=&amp;TradeNmR=корвалол&amp;OwnerName=&amp;MnfOrg=&amp;MnfOrgCountry=&amp;isfs=0&amp;isND=-1&amp;regtype=&amp;order=RegDate&amp;orderType=desc&amp;pageNum=1|accessdate=14 December 2015|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar Products ==
The manufacturer Farmak produces another similar product, Corvaldin, which is similar in composition to Corvalol, but also contains 0.2&amp;nbsp;mg hops oil per 1mL on tincture.&lt;ref&gt;Фармак. "Корвалдин" http://farmak.ua/ru/drugs/135&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3708">'''Culinary names''', '''menu names''', or '''kitchen names''' are names of foods used in the preparation or selling of food, as opposed to their names in [[agriculture]] or in scientific [[nomenclature]]. The menu name may even be different from the kitchen name. For example, from the 19th until the mid-20th century, many restaurant menus were written in [[French language|French]] and not in the local language.

Examples include [[veal]] ([[calf]]), [[calamari]] ([[squid]]), and [[sweetbread]]s ([[pancreas]] or [[thymus gland]]). Culinary names are especially common for fish and seafood, where multiple species are marketed under a single familiar name.

Foods may come to have distinct culinary names for a variety of reasons:

* [[Euphemism]]: the idea of eating some foods may disgust or offend some eaters regardless of their actual taste
** [[Testicle]]s: [[Rocky Mountain oysters]], Prairie oysters, lamb fries, or [[animelles]]
** Fish [[Milt]]:  soft roe or white roe to disguise that is actually sperm not eggs
** Thymus gland and pancreas gland: [[sweetbreads]]
** [[Kangaroo meat]]:  "Australus" has been proposed as a euphemism{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* Attractiveness: the traditional name may be considered dull, undistinctive, or unattractive
** [[Kiwifruit]]:  a rename of the Chinese gooseberry, which references its fuzzy brown skin, and has now become its standard name
** Mahi-Mahi:  the [[Coryphaenidae|dolphinfish]] is often referred to with this name to avoid confusion with [[dolphin]] (the mammal) meat
** The [[Patagonian toothfish]] is marketed as the Chilean sea bass
** The African Cichlid found in many [[aquarium|aquaria]] is presented as [[Tilapia]]
** The spinal [[Bone marrow|marrow]] of veal and [[beef]] is called ''amourettes''&lt;ref&gt;from a Provencal word for roosters' testicles, but homonymous with 'puppy love' [[Le petit Robert]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='simon'&gt;Andre Simon, ''A concise encyclopedia of gastronomy'', ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Grouping of a variety of sources under a single name
** [[Tuna]] includes several different species
* Evocation of more prestigious, rarer, and more expensive foods for which they are a substitute
** [[Cyclopterus lumpus|Lumpsucker]] (or lumpfish) [[roe]] is named lumpfish [[caviar]]
** [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|Cassia]] bark is called [[cinnamon]]
** [[Langostino]] is sometimes called [[lobster]] or "langostino lobster"
** In North America, many [[flounder]] species are called [[Sole (fish)|soles]], ''e.g.'' [[Microstomus pacificus]] is named "Dover sole"
* Evocation of a specific culinary tradition
** Shrimp in Italian-American contexts is often called scampi
** Florentine refers to dishes that include spinach
** Squid is often called by its Italian name, calamari, on menus&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Gisslen, ''Professional Cooking'', p. 446&lt;/ref&gt;
* Social differences
** The words beef, veal, [[pork]], [[mutton]], [[venison]] and [[poultry]] are derived from the words used by the French-speaking lords in post-[[Norman Conquest|Conquest]] England{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}
* Other
** In French, [[chestnut]]s are called ''châtaignes'' on the tree, but ''marrons'' in the kitchen
** [[Laver (seaweed)|Laver]] is a culinary name for certain edible algae&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], ''s.v.''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harold Judd Noyes''' (1898 - 1968), often called "Dean Noyes", was an American orthodontist who graduated from [[Angle School of Orthodontia]]. He was the Chairman of the Orthodontic Department of the Northwestern University Dental School. He also served as the Dean of University of Oregon Dental School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jump|first1=EB|title=Dean Harold Noyes|journal=Angle Orthodontist|date=1969|url=http://www.angle.org/doi/pdf/10.1043/0003-3219(1969)039%3C0215%3AIM%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was the son of [[Frederick Bogue Noyes]] and grandson of [[Edmund Noyes]], who both served as deans of American dental schools. He received his college degree from [[Beloit College]]. He received his dental degree in 1928 from [[University of Illinois College of Dentistry]] and received his medical degree in 1933 from [[Rush Medical School]].  His education was interrupted because of World War I in 1917 and 1919.  He was married to Elizabeth Noyes and had a daughter, Loren N. Bates.

==Career==
In his professional career, Dr. Noyes served as a pediatrician at Presbyterian Hospital, Children's Memorial in Chicago. He served as a consultant to Zoller Memorial Dental Clinic in Chicago in 1940. He was the Chairman of the Orthodontic Department of the [[Northwestern University Dental School]] from 1940 to 1946. He then served as the Dean of University of Oregon Dental School from 1946 until his death in 1967.

While being Dean at [[Oregon Health &amp; Science University School of Dentistry]], Dr. Noyes introduced the "Vertical Curriculum" for dental students. He allowed first-year dental students to construct full dentures and participate in exercise of tooth morphology. This made a profound impact in dental education, as this curriculum was widely accepted and implemented in other dental schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jump|first1=EB|title=Dean Harold Noyes|journal=Angle Orthodontist|date=1969|url=http://www.angle.org/doi/pdf/10.1043/0003-3219(1969)039%3C0215%3AIM%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also co-authored a textbook with his father, ''Oral Histology and Embryology with Laboratory Directions''.

==Positions held==
* American Association of Dental Schools, President, 1955
* American Dental Association, Chairman of Section on Research, 1940
* Council of Dental Education, member, 1960-1964

&lt;!-- Definition and characteristics --&gt;
'''Diarrhea''', also spelled '''diarrhoea''', is the condition of having at least three loose or liquid [[defecation|bowel movement]]s each day.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; It often lasts for a few days and can result in [[dehydration]] due to fluid loss.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; This can progress to decreased [[urination]], [[pallor|loss of skin color]], a [[tachycardia|fast heart rate]], and a [[Altered level of consciousness|decrease in responsiveness]] as it becomes more severe.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; Loose but non-watery [[feces|stool]]s in babies who are exclusively [[Breastfeeding|breastfed]], however, are normal.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The most common cause is an infection of the [[intestine]]s due to either a [[virus]], [[bacteria]], or [[parasite]] – a condition also known as [[gastroenteritis]].&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; These infections are often acquired from food or water that has been contaminated by [[Human feces|feces]], or directly from another person who is infected.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; The three types of diarrhea are: short duration watery diarrhea, short duration bloody diarrhea, and persistent diarrhea (lasting more than two weeks).&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; The short duration watery diarrhea may be due to an infection by [[cholera]], although this is rare in the developed world.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; If blood is present it is also known as [[dysentery]].&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt; A number of non-infectious causes can result in diarrhea.&lt;ref name=CEM2013/&gt; These include [[lactose intolerance]], [[irritable bowel syndrome]], [[non-celiac gluten sensitivity]], [[Coeliac disease|celiac disease]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[hyperthyroidism]], [[bile acid diarrhea]], and a number of medications.&lt;ref name=CEM2013&gt;{{cite book |editor=Basem Abdelmalak |editor2=John Doyle|title=Anesthesia for otolaryngologic surgery |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=1107018676|pages=282–287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SaponeBai&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sapone A, Bai JC, Ciacci C, Dolinsek J, Green PH, Hadjivassiliou M, Kaukinen K, Rostami K, Sanders DS, Schumann M, Ullrich R, Villalta D, Volta U, Catassi C, Fasano A |title=Spectrum of gluten-related disorders: consensus on new nomenclature and classification |journal=BMC Medicine |volume=10 |issue= |pages=13 |year=2012 |pmid=22313950 |pmc=3292448 |doi=10.1186/1741-7015-10-13 |type=Review}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slattery|first1=SA|last2=Niaz|first2=O|last3=Aziz|first3=Q|last4=Ford|first4=AC|last5=Farmer|first5=AD|title=Systematic review with meta-analysis: the prevalence of bile acid malabsorption in the irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea.|journal=Alimentary Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics|date=July 2015|volume=42|issue=1|pages=3–11|doi=10.1111/apt.13227|pmid=25913530}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, [[Stool test|stool cultures]] to confirm the exact cause are not required.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014/&gt;

==Definition==

Diarrhea is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as having three or more loose or liquid [[Defecation|stools]] per day, or as having more stools than is normal for that person.&lt;ref name=WHO2013/&gt;

Acute diarrhea is defined as an abnormally frequent discharge of semisolid or fluid fecal matter from the bowel, lasting less than 14 days, by [[World Gastroenterology Organisation|World Gastroenterology Organization]].&lt;ref name="WGO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldgastroenterology.org/acute-diarrhea-in-adults.html |title=WGO Practice Guideline - Acute diarrhea |accessdate=9 March 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222012123/http://www.worldgastroenterology.org/acute-diarrhea-in-adults.html |archivedate=22 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secretory===
Secretory diarrhea means that there is an increase in the active secretion, or there is an inhibition of absorption. There is little to no structural damage. The most common cause of this type of diarrhea is a [[cholera toxin]] that stimulates the secretion of [[anion]]s, especially [[chloride]] ions (Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;). Therefore, to maintain a charge balance in the [[gastrointestinal tract]], sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is carried with it, along with water. In this type of diarrhea intestinal fluid secretion is [[Tonicity#3|isotonic]] with plasma even during fasting.&lt;ref name="webmd.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-diarrhea |title=The Basics of Diarrhea |publisher=Webmd.com |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=9 March 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311010926/http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/digestive-diseases-diarrhea |archivedate=11 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MoonZhang2015"/&gt; It continues even when there is no oral food intake.

===Osmotic===
Osmotic diarrhea occurs when too much water is drawn into the bowels. If a person drinks solutions with excessive sugar or excessive salt, these can draw water from the body into the bowel and cause osmotic diarrhea.&lt;ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005&gt;{{cite web|url = http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf|title = The Treatment Of Diarrhea, A manual for physicians and other senior health workers|publisher = [[World Health Organization]]|version = Sometimes needs to be downloaded twice.

See also "8.

Or it can be caused by osmotic [[laxatives]] (which work to alleviate [[constipation]] by drawing water into the bowels). In healthy individuals, too much [[magnesium]] or [[vitamin C]] or undigested [[lactose]] can produce osmotic diarrhea and distention of the bowel. A person who has [[lactose intolerance]] can have difficulty absorbing lactose after an extraordinarily high intake of dairy products. In persons who have [[fructose malabsorption]], excess fructose intake can also cause diarrhea. High-fructose foods that also have a high glucose content are more absorbable and less likely to cause diarrhea. Sugar alcohols such as sorbitol (often found in sugar-free foods) are difficult for the body to absorb and, in large amounts, may lead to osmotic diarrhea.&lt;ref name="webmd.com"/&gt; In most of these cases, osmotic diarrhea stops when the offending agent (e.g. milk, sorbitol) is stopped.

===Exudative===
Exudative diarrhea occurs with the presence of blood and pus in the stool. This occurs with [[inflammatory bowel diseases]], such as [[Crohn's disease]] or [[ulcerative colitis]], and other severe infections such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' or other forms of food poisoning.&lt;ref name="MoonZhang2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="webmd.com"/&gt;

===Inflammatory===
Inflammatory diarrhea occurs when there is damage to the mucosal lining or brush border, which leads to a passive loss of protein-rich fluids and a decreased ability to absorb these lost fluids. Features of all three of the other types of diarrhea{{clarify|date=August 2013}} can be found in this type of diarrhea. It can be caused by bacterial infections, viral infections, parasitic infections, or autoimmune problems such as inflammatory bowel diseases. It can also be caused by tuberculosis, colon cancer, and enteritis.&lt;ref name="MoonZhang2015"/&gt;

===Dysentery===
If there is blood visible in the stools, it is also known as [[dysentery]]. The blood is a trace of an invasion of bowel tissue. Dysentery is a symptom of, among others, ''[[Shigella]]'', ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'', and ''[[Salmonella]]''.&lt;ref name="MoonZhang2015"/&gt;

==Health effects==

Diarrheal disease may have a negative impact on both physical fitness and mental development. "Early childhood malnutrition resulting from any cause reduces physical fitness and work productivity in adults,"&lt;ref name='d'&gt;{{cite web|last=Disease Control Priorities Project|title=Public Health Significance of Diarrheal Illnesses|url=http://www.dcp2.org/pubs/DCP/19/Section/2531|publisher=The World Bank Group|accessdate=12 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125100705/http://www.dcp2.org/pubs/DCP/19/Section/2531|archivedate=25 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and diarrhea is a primary cause of childhood malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guerrant RL, Schorling JB, McAuliffe JF, de Souza MA | title = Diarrhea as a cause and an effect of malnutrition: diarrhea prevents catch-up growth and malnutrition increases diarrhea frequency and duration | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 47 | issue = 1 Pt 2 | pages = 28–35 | date = July 1992 | pmid = 1632474 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, evidence suggests that diarrheal disease has significant impacts on mental development and health; it has been shown that, even when controlling for [[helminth]] infection and early breastfeeding, children who had experienced severe diarrhea had significantly lower scores on a series of tests of intelligence.&lt;ref name='d' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grantham-McGregor SM, Walker SP, Chang S | title = Nutritional deficiencies and later behavioural development | journal = The Proceedings of the Nutrition Society | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–54 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10828173 | doi = 10.1017/S0029665100000069 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diarrhea can cause [[electrolyte imbalance]]s, [[renal impairment]], [[dehydration]], and defective [[immune system]] responses. When oral drugs are administered, the efficiency of the drug is to produce a [[therapeutic effect]] and the lack of this effect may be due to the medication travelling too quickly through the digestive system, limiting the time that it can be absorbed. Clinicians try to treat the diarrheas by reducing the dosage of medication, changing the dosing schedule, discontinuation of the drug, and rehydration. The interventions to control the diarrhea are not often effective. Diarrhea can have a profound effect on the quality of life because fecal incontinence is one of the leading factors for placing older adults in [[long term care facilities]] (nursing homes).&lt;ref name="MoonZhang2015"/&gt;

==Differential diagnosis==
[[File:Stomach colon rectum diagram-en.svg|right|thumb|Diagram of the [[human gastrointestinal tract]].]]

[[acute (medicine)|Acute]] diarrhea is most commonly due to viral [[gastroenteritis]] with [[rotavirus]], which accounts for 40% of cases in children under five.&lt;ref name=WHO2010a/&gt; In [[traveler's diarrhea|travelers]], however, [[bacterial infections]] predominate.&lt;ref name="pmid16267716"/&gt; Various toxins such as [[Amanita phalloides#Symptoms|mushroom poisoning]] and drugs can also cause acute diarrhea.

Chronic diarrhea can be the part of the presentations of a number of chronic medical conditions affecting the intestine. Common causes include [[ulcerative colitis]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[microscopic colitis]], [[celiac disease]], [[irritable bowel syndrome]] and [[bile acid malabsorption]].

===Infections===
{{Main|Infectious diarrhea}}

There are many causes of infectious diarrhea, which include [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]] and parasites.&lt;ref name="pmid18813221"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Navaneethan U, Giannella RA | title = Mechanisms of infectious diarrhea | journal = Nature Clinical Practice Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | pages = 637–47 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18813221 | doi = 10.1038/ncpgasthep1264 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infectious diarrhea is frequently referred to as [[gastroenteritis]].&lt;ref name=Dav2008&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Schlossberg|title=Clinical Infectious Disease|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139576659|page=349|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-wWY1_mSeq0C&amp;pg=PA349|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norovirus]] is the most common cause of viral diarrhea in adults,&lt;ref name="pmid19084472"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patel MM, Hall AJ, Vinjé J, Parashar UD | title = Noroviruses: a comprehensive review | journal = Journal of Clinical Virology | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19084472 | doi = 10.1016/j.jcv.2008.10.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[rotavirus]] is the most common cause in children under five years old.&lt;ref name="pmid19457420"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greenberg HB, Estes MK | title = Rotaviruses: from pathogenesis to vaccination | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 136 | issue = 6 | pages = 1939–51 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19457420 | pmc = 3690811 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2009.02.076 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adenovirus]] types 40 and 41,&lt;ref name="pmid1962727"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uhnoo I, Svensson L, Wadell G | title = Enteric adenoviruses | journal = Baillière's Clinical Gastroenterology | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 627–42 | date = September 1990 | pmid = 1962727 | doi = 10.1016/0950-3528(90)90053-J }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[astrovirus]]es cause a significant number of infections.&lt;ref name="pmid12442031"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitchell DK | title = Astrovirus gastroenteritis | journal = The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal | volume = 21 | issue = 11 | pages = 1067–9 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12442031 | doi =  10.1097/00006454-200211000-00018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli]], such as [[E coli o157:h7]], are the most common cause of infectious bloody diarrhea in the United States.

''[[Campylobacter]]'' [[species|spp.]] are a common cause of bacterial diarrhea, but infections by ''[[Salmonella]]'' spp., ''[[Shigella]]'' spp. and some strains of ''Escherichia coli'' are also a frequent cause.&lt;ref name="pmid19116615"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Viswanathan VK, Hodges K, Hecht G | title = Enteric infection meets intestinal function: how bacterial pathogens cause diarrhoea | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 110–9 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19116615 | pmc = 3326399 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the elderly, particularly those who have been treated with antibiotics for unrelated infections, a toxin produced by ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]'' often causes severe diarrhea.&lt;ref name="pmid19528959"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rupnik M, Wilcox MH, Gerding DN | title = ''Clostridium difficile'' infection: new developments in epidemiology and pathogenesis | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 526–36 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19528959 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2164 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parasites, particularly [[protozoa]] (e.g., ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' spp., ''[[Giardia]]'' spp., ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'', ''[[Blastocystis]]'' spp., ''[[Cyclospora cayetanensis]]''), are frequently the cause of diarrhea that involves chronic infection. The broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent [[nitazoxanide]] has shown efficacy against many diarrhea-causing parasites.&lt;ref name="pmid22301075"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rossignol JF, Lopez-Chegne N, Julcamoro LM, Carrion ME, Bardin MC | title = Nitazoxanide for the empiric treatment of pediatric infectious diarrhea | journal = Trans.

===Malabsorption===
{{Main|Malabsorption}}
[[Malabsorption]] is the inability to absorb food fully, mostly from disorders in the small bowel, but also due to maldigestion from diseases of the [[pancreas]].

Causes include:
* ''enzyme deficiencies or mucosal abnormality'', as in [[food allergy]] and [[food intolerance]], e.g. [[celiac disease]] (gluten intolerance), [[lactose intolerance]] (intolerance to milk sugar, common in non-Europeans), and [[fructose malabsorption]].
* ''[[pernicious anemia]]'', or impaired bowel function due to the inability to absorb [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]],
* ''loss of pancreatic secretions'', which may be due to [[cystic fibrosis]] or [[pancreatitis]],
* ''structural defects'', like [[short bowel syndrome]] (surgically removed bowel) and radiation fibrosis, such as usually follows cancer treatment and other drugs, including agents used in [[chemotherapy]]; and
* ''certain drugs'', like [[orlistat]], which inhibits the absorption of fat.

===Inflammatory bowel disease===
{{Main|Inflammatory bowel disease}}
The two overlapping types here are of unknown origin:
* [[Ulcerative colitis]] is marked by chronic bloody diarrhea and inflammation mostly affects the distal [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] near the [[rectum]].
* [[Crohn's disease]] typically affects fairly well demarcated segments of bowel in the colon and often affects the end of the small bowel.

===Irritable bowel syndrome===
{{Main|Irritable bowel syndrome}}
Another possible cause of diarrhea is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which usually presents with abdominal discomfort relieved by [[defecation]] and unusual [[Human feces|stool]] (diarrhea or [[constipation]]) for at least 3 days a week over the previous 3 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Longstreth GF, Thompson WG, Chey WD, Houghton LA, Mearin F, Spiller RC | title = Functional bowel disorders | journal = Gastroenterology | volume = 130 | issue = 5 | pages = 1480–91 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16678561 | doi = 10.1053/j.gastro.2005.11.061 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms of diarrhea-predominant IBS can be managed through a combination of dietary changes, soluble fiber supplements and medications such as [[loperamide]] or [[codeine]]. About 30% of patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS have [[bile acid malabsorption]] diagnosed with an abnormal [[SeHCAT]] test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wedlake L, A'Hern R, Russell D, Thomas K, Walters JR, Andreyev HJ | title = Systematic review: the prevalence of idiopathic bile acid malabsorption as diagnosed by SeHCAT scanning in patients with diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome | journal = Alimentary Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics | volume = 30 | issue = 7 | pages = 707–17 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19570102 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2036.2009.04081.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other diseases===
Diarrhea can be caused by other diseases and conditions, namely: 
*Chronic [[ethanol]] ingestion&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Kasper DL, Braunwald E, Fauci AS, Hauser SL, Longo DL, Jameson JL. [[Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine]]. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2005. {{ISBN|0-07-139140-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ischemia|Ischemic]] bowel disease: This usually affects older people and can be due to blocked arteries.
*[[Microscopic colitis]], a type of [[inflammatory bowel disease]] where changes are only seen on histological examination of colonic biopsies.
*[[Bile salt malabsorption]] ([[primary bile acid diarrhea]]) where excessive [[bile acids]] in the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] produce a secretory diarrhea.
*Hormone-secreting tumors: some hormones (e.g., [[serotonin]]) can cause diarrhea if excreted in excess (usually from a tumor).
*Chronic mild diarrhea in infants and toddlers may occur with no obvious cause and with no other ill effects; this condition is called [[toddler's diarrhea]].
*[[Environmental enteropathy]]
*[[Radiation enteropathy]] following treatment for pelvic and abdominal cancers.

==Causes==

===Sanitation===
[[File:Slum and dirty river.jpg|thumb|Poverty often leads to unhygienic living conditions, as in this community in the Indian Himalayas. Such conditions promote contraction of diarrheal diseases, as a result of poor [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]].]]
[[Open defecation]] is a leading cause of infectious diarrhea leading to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs330/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Diarrhoeal disease |publisher=Who.int |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401193648/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs330/en/ |archivedate=1 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poverty is a good indicator of the rate of infectious diarrhea in a population. This association does not stem from poverty itself, but rather from the conditions under which impoverished people live. The absence of certain resources compromises the ability of the poor to defend themselves against infectious diarrhea. "Poverty is associated with poor housing, crowding, dirt floors, lack of access to clean water or to sanitary disposal of fecal waste ([[sanitation]]), cohabitation with domestic animals that may carry human pathogens, and a lack of refrigerated storage for food, all of which increase the frequency of diarrhea... Poverty also restricts the ability to provide age-appropriate, nutritionally balanced diets or to modify diets when diarrhea develops so as to mitigate and repair nutrient losses. The impact is exacerbated by the lack of adequate, available, and affordable medical care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jamison|first1=Dean T.|title=Disease control priorities in developing countries|date=2006|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=New York|isbn=0821361791|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water===
One of the most common causes of infectious diarrhea is a lack of clean water. Often, improper fecal disposal leads to contamination of groundwater. This can lead to widespread infection among a population, especially in the absence of water filtration or purification. Human feces contains a variety of potentially harmful human pathogens.&lt;ref name="Brown 629–34"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown J, Cairncross S, Ensink JH | title = Water, sanitation, hygiene and enteric infections in children | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 98 | issue = 8 | pages = 629–34 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23761692 | pmc = 3717778 | doi = 10.1136/archdischild-2011-301528 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrition===
Proper nutrition is important for health and functioning, including the prevention of infectious diarrhea. It is especially important to young children who do not have a fully developed immune system. [[Zinc deficiency]], a condition often found in children in [[developing countries]] can, even in mild cases, have a significant impact on the development and proper functioning of the human immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Black RE, Sazawal S | title = Zinc and childhood infectious disease morbidity and mortality | journal = The British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 85 Suppl 2 | pages = S125–9 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11509100 | doi = 10.1079/bjn2000304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shankar AH, Prasad AS | title = Zinc and immune function: the biological basis of altered resistance to infection | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 68 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = 447S–463S | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9701160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, this relationship between zinc deficiency and reduced immune functioning corresponds with an increased severity of infectious diarrhea. Children who have lowered levels of zinc have a greater number of instances of diarrhea, severe diarrhea, and diarrhea associated with fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bahl R, Bhandari N, Hambidge KM, Bhan MK | title = Plasma zinc as a predictor of diarrheal and respiratory morbidity in children in an urban slum setting | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 68 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = 414S–417S | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9701154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[vitamin A deficiency]] can cause an increase in the severity of diarrheal episodes. However, there is some discrepancy when it comes to the impact of vitamin A deficiency on the rate of disease. While some argue that a relationship does not exist between the rate of disease and vitamin A status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rice|first=Amy L.|title=Comparative quantification of health risks|publisher=WHO|pages=238–240}}&lt;/ref&gt; others suggest an increase in the rate associated with deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sommer A, Katz J, Tarwotjo I | title = Increased risk of respiratory disease and diarrhea in children with preexisting mild vitamin A deficiency | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 1090–5 | date = November 1984 | pmid = 6496388 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that estimates suggest 127 million preschool children worldwide are vitamin A deficient, this population has the potential for increased risk of disease contraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = West KP | title = Extent of vitamin A deficiency among preschool children and women of reproductive age | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 132 | issue = 9 Suppl | pages = 2857S–2866S | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12221262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medications===
Some medications, such as the [[side effects of penicillin|penicillum]] can cause diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Vallerand | first = April | title = Davis's drug guide for nurses | publisher = F.A.

===Evolution===
According to two researchers, [[Randolph M. Nesse|Nesse]] and [[George C. Williams (biologist)|Williams]], diarrhea may function as an evolved expulsion defense mechanism. As a result, if it is stopped, there might be a delay in recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Williams, George |author2=Nesse, Randolph M. |title=Why we get sick: the new science of Darwinian medicine |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |year=1996 |pages=36–38 |isbn=0-679-74674-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They cite in support of this argument research published in 1973 that found that treating ''[[Shigella]]'' with the anti-diarrhea drug (Co-phenotrope, [[Lomotil]]) caused people to stay [[fever]]ish twice as long as those not so treated.

Diarrhea may represent a defense mechanism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = DuPont HL, Hornick RB | title = Adverse effect of lomotil therapy in shigellosis | journal = JAMA | volume = 226 | issue = 13 | pages = 1525–8 | date = December 1973 | pmid = 4587313 | doi = 10.1001/jama.226.13.1525 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnostic approach==
The following types of diarrhea may indicate further investigation is needed:

*In infants
*Moderate or severe diarrhea in young children
*Associated with blood
*Continues for more than two days
*Associated non-cramping [[abdominal pain]], [[fever]], [[weight loss]], etc.
*In [[Traveler's diarrhea|travelers]]
*In food handlers, because of the potential to infect others;
*In institutions such as hospitals, child care centers, or geriatric and convalescent homes.

A severity score is used to aid diagnosis in children.&lt;ref name="pmid2371542"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruuska T, Vesikari T | title = Rotavirus disease in Finnish children: use of numerical scores for clinical severity of diarrhoeal episodes | journal = Scand.

==Prevention==

===Sanitation===
Numerous studies have shown that improvements in drinking water and sanitation ([[WASH]]) lead to decreased risks of diarrhoea.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolf|first1=Jennyfer|last2=Prüss-Ustün|first2=Annette|last3=Cumming|first3=Oliver|last4=Bartram|first4=Jamie|last5=Bonjour|first5=Sophie|last6=Cairncross|first6=Sandy|last7=Clasen|first7=Thomas|last8=Colford|first8=John M.|last9=Curtis|first9=Valerie|last10=De France|first10=Jennifer|last11=Fewtrell|first11=Lorna|last12=Freeman|first12=Matthew C.|last13=Gordon|first13=Bruce|last14=Hunter|first14=Paul R.|last15=Jeandron|first15=Aurelie|last16=Johnston|first16=Richard B.|last17=Mäusezahl|first17=Daniel|last18=Mathers|first18=Colin|last19=Neira|first19=Maria|last20=Higgins|first20=Julian P.

In institutions, communities, and households, interventions that promote [[hand washing]] with soap lead to significant reductions in the incidence of diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ejemot-Nwadiaro|first=Regina I.|last2=Ehiri|first2=John E.|last3=Arikpo|first3=Dachi|last4=Meremikwu|first4=Martin M.|last5=Critchley|first5=Julia A.|date=2015-09-03|title=Hand washing promotion for preventing diarrhoea|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=9|pages=CD004265|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004265.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmc=4563982|pmid=26346329}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same applies to preventing [[open defecation]] at a community-wide level and providing access to [[improved sanitation]].&lt;ref name="UN2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Call to action on sanitation|url=http://sanitationdrive2015.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSG_Sanitation_Fast-Facts_final.pdf|website=United Nations|accessdate=15 August 2014|format=pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084624/http://sanitationdrive2015.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/DSG_Sanitation_Fast-Facts_final.pdf|archivedate=19 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0073784 |title=Open Defecation and Childhood Stunting in India: An Ecological Analysis of New Data from 112 Districts |publisher=PLoS ONE |date= |accessdate=2014-03-10 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0073784 |pmid=24066070 |volume=8 |issue=9 |journal=PLoS ONE |pages=e73784 |year=2013 |last1=Spears |first1=Dean |last2=Ghosh |first2=Arabinda |last3=Cumming |first3=Oliver |bibcode=2013PLoSO...873784S |pmc=3774764 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220171456/http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi/10.1371/journal.pone.0073784 |archivedate=20 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes use of [[toilet]]s and implementation of the entire [[sanitation]] chain connected to the toilets (collection, transport, disposal or reuse of [[human waste|human excreta]]).

====Hand washing====
Basic sanitation techniques can have a profound effect on the transmission of diarrheal disease. The implementation of hand washing using soap and water, for example, has been experimentally shown to reduce the incidence of disease by approximately 42–48%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Curtis V, Cairncross S | title = Effect of washing hands with soap on diarrhoea risk in the community: a systematic review | journal = The Lancet Infectious Diseases | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 275–81 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12726975 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00606-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cairncross S, Hunt C, Boisson S, Bostoen K, Curtis V, Fung IC, Schmidt WP | title = Water, sanitation and hygiene for the prevention of diarrhoea | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 39 Suppl 1 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = i193–205 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20348121 | pmc = 2845874 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyq035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hand washing in developing countries, however, is compromised by poverty as acknowledged by the CDC: "Handwashing is integral to disease prevention in all parts of the world; however, access to soap and water is limited in a number of less developed countries. This lack of access is one of many challenges to proper hygiene in less developed countries." Solutions to this barrier require the implementation of educational programs that encourage sanitary behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diarrheal Diseases in Less Developed Countries|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/ldc/diarrheal_diseases.html|work=CDC|accessdate=28 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104042634/http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/ldc/diarrheal_diseases.html|archivedate=4 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Water====
Given that water contamination is a major means of transmitting diarrheal disease, efforts to provide clean [[water supply]] and [[improved sanitation]] have the potential to dramatically cut the rate of disease incidence. In fact, it has been proposed that we might expect an 88% reduction in child mortality resulting from diarrheal disease as a result of improved water sanitation and hygiene.&lt;ref name="Brown 629–34"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Black RE, Morris SS, Bryce J | title = Where and why are 10 million children dying every year? | journal = Lancet | volume = 361 | issue = 9376 | pages = 2226–34 | date = Jun 28, 2003 | pmid = 12842379 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13779-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a meta-analysis of numerous studies on improving water supply and sanitation shows a 22–27% reduction in disease incidence, and a 21–30% reduction in mortality rate associated with diarrheal disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Esrey SA, Feachem RG, Hughes JM | title = Interventions for the control of diarrhoeal diseases among young children: improving water supplies and excreta disposal facilities | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 757–72 | year = 1985 | pmid = 3878742 | pmc = 2536385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chlorine treatment of water, for example, has been shown to reduce both the risk of diarrheal disease, and of contamination of stored water with diarrheal pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arnold BF, Colford JM | title = Treating water with chlorine at point-of-use to improve water quality and reduce child diarrhea in developing countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 76 | issue = 2 | pages = 354–64 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17297049 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaccination===
Immunization against the pathogens that cause diarrheal disease is a viable prevention strategy, however it does require targeting certain pathogens for vaccination. In the case of Rotavirus, which was responsible for around 6% of diarrheal episodes and 20% of diarrheal disease deaths in the children of developing countries, use of a Rotavirus vaccine in trials in 1985 yielded a slight (2-3%) decrease in total diarrheal disease incidence, while reducing overall mortality by 6-10%. Similarly, a Cholera vaccine showed a strong reduction in morbidity and mortality, though the overall impact of vaccination was minimal as Cholera is not one of the major causative pathogens of diarrheal disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Zoysa I, Feachem RG | title = Interventions for the control of diarrhoeal diseases among young children: rotavirus and cholera immunization | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pages = 569–83 | year = 1985 | pmid = 3876173 | pmc = 2536413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this time, more effective vaccines have been developed that have the potential to save many thousands of lives in developing nations, while reducing the overall cost of treatment, and the costs to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rheingans RD, Antil L, Dreibelbis R, Podewils LJ, Bresee JS, Parashar UD | title = Economic costs of rotavirus gastroenteritis and cost-effectiveness of vaccination in developing countries | journal = The Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 200 Suppl 1 | pages = S16–27 | date = Nov 1, 2009 | pmid = 19817595 | doi = 10.1086/605026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oral cholera vaccines in mass immunization campaigns|year=2010|publisher=WHO|isbn=978 92 4 150043 2|pages=6–8|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241500432_eng.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903045312/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241500432_eng.pdf|archivedate=3 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[rotavirus vaccine]] decrease the rates of diarrhea in a population.&lt;ref name=WHO2010a/&gt; New vaccines against rotavirus, ''Shigella'', [[Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli|Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)]], and cholera are under development, as well as other causes of infectious diarrhea.{{mcn|date=January 2015}}

===Nutrition===
Dietary deficiencies in developing countries can be combated by promoting better eating practices. Zinc supplementation proved successful showing a significant decrease in the incidence of diarrheal disease compared to a control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Black RE | title = Zinc deficiency, infectious disease and mortality in the developing world | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 133 | issue = 5 Suppl 1 | pages = 1485S–9S | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12730449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhutta ZA, Black RE, Brown KH, Gardner JM, Gore S, Hidayat A, Khatun F, Martorell R, Ninh NX, Penny ME, Rosado JL, Roy SK, Ruel M, Sazawal S, Shankar A | title = Prevention of diarrhea and pneumonia by zinc supplementation in children in developing countries: pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials.

K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Breastfeeding====
Breastfeeding practices have been shown to have a dramatic effect on the incidence of diarrheal disease in poor populations. Studies across a number of developing nations have shown that those who receive [[Breastfeeding#Exclusive breastfeeding|exclusive breastfeeding]] during their first 6 months of life are better protected against infection with diarrheal diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = | title = Effect of breastfeeding on infant and child mortality due to infectious diseases in less developed countries: a pooled analysis.

===Others===
[[Probiotics]] decrease the risk of diarrhea in those taking [[antibiotics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hempel S, Newberry SJ, Maher AR, Wang Z, Miles JN, Shanman R, Johnsen B, Shekelle PG | title = Probiotics for the prevention and treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 307 | issue = 18 | pages = 1959–69 | date = 9 May 2012 | pmid = 22570464 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2012.3507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
In many cases of diarrhea, replacing lost fluid and salts is the only treatment needed. This is usually by mouth – [[oral rehydration therapy]] – or, in severe cases, [[intravenously]].&lt;ref name=WHO2010a/&gt; Diet restrictions such as the [[BRAT diet]] are no longer recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = King CK, Glass R, Bresee JS, Duggan C | title = Managing acute gastroenteritis among children: oral rehydration, maintenance, and nutritional therapy | journal = MMWR Recomm Rep | volume = 52 | issue = RR–16 | pages = 1–16 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14627948 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5216a1.htm | author5 = Centers for Disease Control Prevention | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141028174056/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5216a1.htm | archivedate = 28 October 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research does not support the limiting of milk to children as doing so has no effect on duration of diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1728 |title=BestBets: Does Withholding milk feeds reduce the duration of diarrhoea in children with acute gastroenteritis? |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504105749/http://www.bestbets.org/bets/bet.php?id=1728 |archivedate=4 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the contrary, WHO recommends that children with diarrhea continue to eat as sufficient nutrients are usually still absorbed to support continued growth and weight gain, and that continuing to eat also speeds up recovery of normal intestinal functioning.&lt;ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/&gt; CDC recommends that children and adults with cholera also continue to eat.&lt;ref name = CDCmanualCholera/&gt;

Medications such as [[loperamide]] (Imodium) and [[bismuth subsalicylate]] may be beneficial; however they may be [[contraindicated]] in certain situations.&lt;ref name="pmid18192963"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schiller LR | title = Management of diarrhea in clinical practice: strategies for primary care physicians | journal = Rev Gastroenterol Disord | volume = 7 | issue = Suppl 3 | pages = S27–38 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18192963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fluids===
{{See also|Management of dehydration}}
[[File:Cholera rehydration nurses.jpg|thumb|A person consuming oral rehydration solution.]]
[[Oral rehydration therapy|Oral rehydration solution (ORS)]] (a slightly sweetened and salty water) can be used to prevent dehydration. Standard home solutions such as salted rice water, salted yogurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given. Home solutions such as water in which cereal has been cooked, unsalted soup, green coconut water, weak tea (unsweetened), and unsweetened fresh fruit juices can have from half a teaspoon to full teaspoon of salt (from one-and-a-half to three grams) added per liter. Clean plain water can also be one of several fluids given.&lt;ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/&gt; There are commercial solutions such as [[Pedialyte]], and relief agencies such as [[UNICEF]] widely distribute packets of salts and sugar. A WHO publication for physicians recommends a homemade ORS consisting of one liter water with one teaspoon salt (3 grams) and two tablespoons sugar (18 grams) added&lt;ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/&gt; (approximately the "taste of tears"&lt;ref name=2010WorldCupTravellersGuide&gt;[http://www.who.int/topics/test/food_safety/safe_food_travel.pdf A Guide on Safe Food for Travellers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709034248/http://www.who.int/topics/test/food_safety/safe_food_travel.pdf |date=9 July 2012 }}, Welcome to South Africa, Host to the 2010 FIFA World Cup (bottom left of page 1).&lt;/ref&gt;). Rehydration Project recommends adding the same amount of sugar but only one-half a teaspoon of salt, stating that this more dilute approach is less risky with very little loss of effectiveness.&lt;ref name=RehydrationProject&gt;Rehydration Project, {{cite web |url=http://rehydrate.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608064953/http://rehydrate.org/ |archivedate=8 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }} Homemade Oral Rehydration Solution Recipe.&lt;/ref&gt; Both agree that drinks with too much sugar or salt can make dehydration worse.&lt;ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=RehydrationProject/&gt;

Appropriate amounts of supplemental zinc and potassium should be added if available. But the availability of these should not delay rehydration. As WHO points out, the most important thing is to begin preventing dehydration as early as possible.&lt;ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/&gt; In another example of prompt ORS hopefully preventing dehydration, CDC recommends for the treatment of cholera continuing to give Oral Rehydration Solution during travel to medical treatment.&lt;ref name=CDCmanualCholera&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/haiticholera/pdf/chw_trainingmaterialsforcholera.pdf Community Health Worker Training Materials for Cholera Prevention and Control] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020070810/http://www.cdc.gov/haiticholera/pdf/chw_trainingmaterialsforcholera.pdf |date=20 October 2011 }}, CDC, slides at back are dated 17 November 2010. Page 7 states " . . . Continue to breastfeed your baby if the baby has watery diarrhea, even when traveling to get treatment. Adults and older children should continue to eat frequently."&lt;/ref&gt;

Vomiting often occurs during the first hour or two of treatment with ORS, especially if a child drinks the solution too quickly, but this seldom prevents successful rehydration since most of the fluid is still absorbed. WHO recommends that if a child vomits, to wait five or ten minutes and then start to give the solution again more slowly.&lt;ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/&gt;

Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as [[soft drinks]] and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may ''increase'' dehydration. A too rich solution in the gut draws water from the rest of the body, just as if the person were to drink sea water.&lt;ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=NICE2009&gt;{{cite web|title=Management of acute diarrhoea and vomiting due to gastroenteritis in children under 5|url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG84|work=National Institute of Clinical Excellence|date=April 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802094158/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG84|archivedate=2 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plain water may be used if more specific and effective ORT preparations are unavailable or are not palatable.&lt;ref name=NICE2009/&gt; Additionally, a mix of both plain water and drinks perhaps too rich in sugar and salt can alternatively be given to the same person, with the goal of providing a medium amount of sodium overall.&lt;ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/&gt; A [[nasogastric tube]] can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted.&lt;ref name=Webb2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Webb A, Starr M | title = Acute gastroenteritis in children | journal = Australian family physician | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 227–31 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15861741 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eating===
The WHO recommends a child with diarrhea continue to be fed. Continued feeding speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function. In contrast, children whose food is restricted have diarrhea of longer duration and recover intestinal function more slowly. The WHO states "Food should ''never'' be withheld and the child's usual foods should ''not'' be diluted. Breastfeeding should ''always'' be continued."&lt;ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/&gt; And in the specific example of cholera, CDC also makes the same recommendation.&lt;ref name = CDCmanualCholera/&gt; Breastfed infants with diarrhea often choose to breastfeed more, and should be encouraged to do so.&lt;ref name=WHOtreatmentdiarrhoea2005/&gt; In young children who are not breast-fed and live in the developed world, a lactose-free diet may be useful to speed recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = MacGillivray S, Fahey T, McGuire W | title = Lactose avoidance for young children with acute diarrhoea | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = CD005433 | date = 31 October 2013 | pmid = 24173771 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005433.pub2 | pmc = 4276385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bile acid sequestrants]] such as [[cholestyramine]] can be effective in chronic diarrhea due to [[bile acid malabsorption]]. Therapeutic trials of these drugs are indicated in chronic diarrhea if bile acid malabsorption cannot be diagnosed with a specific test, such as [[SeHCAT]] retention.

==Terminology==
The word diarrhea is from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[Wiktionary:διάρροια|διάρροια]]}} from {{lang|grc|διά}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|dia}}'' "through" and {{lang|grc|ῥέω}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|rheo}}'' "flow".

Diarrhea is the spelling in [[American English]] while diarrhoea is the spelling in [[Commonwealth English]].

Slang terms for the condition include "the runs", "the squirts", and "the trots".&lt;ref&gt;{{Wiktionary-inline|runs}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=March 2018}}

The '''Einstein Medical Center'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.einstein.edu|title=Einstein Healthcare Network|work=einstein.edu|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an independent Academic Medical Center in the [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] area of the United States. Einstein is a part of the [[Einstein Healthcare Network]].  The medical center offers [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] and [[Fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] training programs in many specialized areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.einstein.edu/education|title=Residencies &amp; Education|work=einstein.edu|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes a Level I Regional Resource [[Trauma Center]] and a Level III [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.einstein.edu/about-us/|title=About Us|work=einstein.edu|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded as the '''Jewish Hospital for the Aged, Infirmed and Destitute''' (''Jewish Hospital'' for short) in August, 1864, this hospital was an important institution in the [[history of the Jews in Philadelphia]], providing care for "the suffering poor of all religions". It officially opened in 1866, starting with 22 beds (the linens donated by philanthropist Moses Rosenbach) at 56th and Haverford Road in West Philadelphia. The hospital soon expanded, moving to Old York Road in 1873, and opening various homes and clinics. In 1952, the Jewish hospital merged with [[Northern Liberties]] [[Northern Liberties Hospital|Hospital]] and [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)|Mount Sinai Hospital]] to form a single medical center. It was named for [[Albert Einstein]] after the volunteer president of Mount Sinai wrote a letter asking Einstein for permission to use his name.  Einstein granted his permission on June 28 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.einsteinnewsroom.com/index.php/About-Us/history-of-albert-einstein-healthcare-network.html |title=News Room |work=einsteinnewsroom.com |accessdate=1 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527042247/http://www.einsteinnewsroom.com/index.php/About-Us/history-of-albert-einstein-healthcare-network.html |archivedate=27 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Gibraltar Sand Dune''' is an ancient [[dune|sand dune]] in the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. It forms part of the [[Upper Rock Nature Reserve]] and dominates the eastern cliffs of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]]. It was once used to capture [[rain]]water which was contained in underground tanks within the Rock to satisfy the population's [[drinking water|potable water]] needs.

==Geology==
[[File:Gibraltar Model 1865 (19).jpg|thumb|The Great Sand Dune as depicted in the 1865 scale model of Gibraltar, now at the [[Gibraltar Museum]].]]
The prehistoric dune is made from yellow, windblown sands lacking the red component of the sands on the west side of the Rock. It is made of the same sand that once formed part of a vast [[savanna]] of the late [[Pleistocene]] where [[Neanderthal]]s hunted.&lt;ref name=UG&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Gibraltar Sand Dune|url=http://www.underground-gibraltar.com/#/the-great-gibraltar-sand-dune/4571975796|work=Underground-Gibraltar.com|publisher=[[Gibraltar Museum]]|accessdate=29 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507093450/http://www.underground-gibraltar.com/#/the-great-gibraltar-sand-dune/4571975796|archivedate=7 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[levant (wind)|levant]] winds of prehistory continuously blew sand from this savanna westwards, accumulating against the eastern cliffs of the Rock, reaching from the base of the cliff right down to sea level (at that time there was no road where [[Sir Herbert Miles Road]] is today).&lt;ref name=UG/&gt; The occasional [[rockfall]] from the precipice above added boulders to the dune so the formation seen today is a consolidated composite of rocks and windblown sands. The upper limits of the dune were scarped by the British garrison for two reasons - to avoid soldiers deserting the place and to prevent surprise attacks by Spanish troops. The Great Sand Dune was constantly shifting right up to the late 19th century when [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated iron sheets]] were laid over the dune for the collection of rainwater.&lt;ref name=UG/&gt; [[John White (naturalist)|John White]] described this and the efforts to make it inaccessible:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Eastern side of the hill consists of an immense sloping bank of whitish sand interspersed with huge fragments of rock, and reaching from the sea nearly to the summit of the rock in some parts not far from the [[Signal Hill Battery, Gibraltar|Signal House]], and the [[Middle Hill Battery|Middle-hill Guards]]. These parts were formerly accessible, which made it necessary to keep constant guards there, as well to prevent desertions from within as a surprise from without. Of late years, much labour has been bestowed in making all these parts more abrupt and difficult, yet it is still necessary to watch them, as there are always some hardy adventurers who will wantonly risk their lives down these perilous cliffs, either in attempting to desert or in search of flowers."&lt;ref name=UG/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Water catchments==
[[File:Gibraltar East Side Water Catchments in 1992.jpg|thumb|View of Sandy Bay, Gibraltar in 1992 showing the catchment areas]]
Gibraltar has few natural sources of [[fresh water]] which has been historically problematic for its population over the centuries. In 1898, the construction on the [[waterworks]] began with the construction of four {{Convert|5,000,000|impgal|l}} reservoirs cut inside the western side of the Rock at an elevation of {{convert|103.6|m|ft}} above sea level, each being {{convert|60.96|m|ft}} long {{convert|15.24|m|ft}} high and with an average width of {{Convert|6.1|m|ft}}, with a total capacity of {{Convert|22,727|m2|ft2}}. They were officially inaugurated by [[Governor of Gibraltar]] [[George White (British Army officer)|Sir George White]] in 1901. These reservoirs were initially fed by relatively small water catchment areas on the western side of the Rock above the [[Moorish Castle]].&lt;ref name=DG/&gt;&lt;ref name=AG&gt;{{cite web|title=Gibraltar Water Supply History|url=http://aquagib.gi/corporate/gibraltar-water-supply-history|publisher=AquaGib|accessdate=6 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415074901/http://www.aquagib.gi/corporate/gibraltar-water-supply-history|archivedate=15 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Gibraltar's population and demand for a fresh water supply increased, further sources of supply were required and a scheme to expand the system was proposed and carried out. This consisted of the construction of a {{convert|40,000|m2|ha}} [[Drainage basin|water catchment]] area on the east side of the Rock and the driving of an {{convert|800|m|ft}} tunnel through the Rock running east-west to channel the water to the existing reservoirs. The catchment which was the original idea of the then City Engineer of Gibraltar and was constructed in 1903 on the Great Sand Dune which has an average inclination of 1⅓ to 1. The largest of the boulders embedded in the dune were blasted away in order to trim the surface as even as possible. A footpath and channel for the collection of rainwater were constructed along the lower perimeter of the catchment area. [[wood|Timber]] piles {{convert|1,500|mm|in}} x {{convert|150|mm|in}} x {{convert|40|mm|in}} were driven their full length into the smoothed dune. To these a timber framing of {{convert|75|mm|in}} x {{convert|75|mm|in}} x {{convert|4,500|mm|in}} [[purlin]]s and {{convert|75|mm|in}} x {{convert|75|mm|in}} x {{convert|2,400|mm|in}} rafters were nailed to them which was followed by screwing corrugated galvanised iron sheets {{convert|2,400|mm|in}} x {{convert|900|mm|in}} round the edges. The timber had been previously pressure treated with [[creosote]] at a pressure of {{convert|170|psi|kPa}}. Further expansions of the Great Sand Dune catchments were carried out in stages up until 1961.&lt;ref name=DG&gt;{{cite web|last=Crone|first=Jim|url=http://www.discovergibraltar.com|publisher=DiscoverGibraltar.com|title=Sandy Bay|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626103203/http://www.discovergibraltar.com/|archivedate=2012-06-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original plan was to cover an area of {{convert|10|acre|m2}}. Between 1911 and 1914 a fifth reservoir was excavated inside the Rock and the catchment area increased to {{convert|24|acre|m2}}. By 1961 the total catchment area had increased to its maximum of {{convert|34|acre|m2}}.&lt;ref name=DG/&gt; It took roughly 5,928 rafters, 1,112 purlins, 1,161 piles, 5,928 sheets, 2,920&amp;nbsp;kg of screws and 850&amp;nbsp;kg of washers for every hectare of the Great Dune that was covered.

==Other uses==
The Great Dune served to maintain a regular supply of sand on the eastern beaches of Gibraltar, especially [[Sandy Bay, Gibraltar|Sandy Bay]] particularly when the sea removed material from the beach. This dynamic nature meant that little vegetation of any significant height could grow on the dune with any permanence as many pre-catchment photographs demonstrate.&lt;ref name=UG/&gt;

In 2001, the [[Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society]] began to manage the phased work of dismantling the catchment construction. By 2006 the slope was entirely restored to its natural state and is now completely covered in vegetation native to the  habitat of Gibraltar.&lt;ref name=DG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gonhs.org/sections.htm|work=GONHS.org|title=Image of successfully re-vegetated dune|publisher=[[Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317030227/http://gonhs.org/sections.htm|archivedate=2013-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Healthcare==
The [[Caisses Sociales de Monaco]] is the compulsory social insurance scheme in the principality which gives entitlement to the public healthcare system. Employers have to contribute 24% of their gross payroll for healthcare and employees 15% of their earnings. This entitles contributors and their families to reimbursement of between 80% and 100% of the cost of medical procedures,  prescriptions, dentistry, rehabilitation, pregnancy and childbirth, and some hospitalizations.  French and Italian citizens can use public health facilities if they have contributed to their home country’s state health care scheme.  The [[Carte Vitale]], which is issued on registration with the Caisses Sociales de Monaco, is used to record administrative, not clinical, information about patients. Patients must register with a doctor employed through the scheme.

There is also a great deal of private practice. 

There are three public hospitals: [[Princess Grace Hospital Centre]], the [[Cardiothoracic Center of Monaco]] and the [[Haemodialysis]] Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Monaco Health Insurance |url=https://www.pacificprime.com/country/europe/monaco-health-insurance/ |website=Pacific Prime |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Total health expenditure in the country was only about 4% in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Monaco |url=http://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/monaco/data-and-statistics |accessdate=20 November 2018 |publisher=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hurry Down Sunshine''''' is a best-selling 2008 [[memoir]] by nonfiction writer [[Michael Greenberg (writer)|Michael Greenberg]].  The book tells the story of the author's daughter and her battle with mental illness.  

== Reception ==

The book received attention for both its literary style and its provocative content.  In ''[[The New York Times]]'', Rachel Donadio's review focussed on Greenberg's attention to New York City, writing that the work was "filled with the kind of characters increasingly rare in a city where real kooks can no longer afford to live."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/books/review/Donadio-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;n=Top/Features/Books/Book%20Reviews&amp;_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1239297754-nk7RWOSYrbhs8asL9Xud4Q  A fire in her brain] by Rachel Donadio, The New York Times, September 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural critic [[Jacob M. Appel|Jacob Appel]] praised the memoir "one of those extremely rare works of literature that operates well as both a love story and a social indictment—without either aspect interfering with the dramatic force of the other."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raintaxi.com/online/2009spring/greenberg.shtml Review of ''Hurry Down, Sunshine''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015164555/http://www.raintaxi.com/online/2009spring/greenberg.shtml |date=2009-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3283">'''Jacob Arlow''' (1912–2004) was an American teacher, scholar, and clinician who served as president of the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]] and the [[New York Psychoanalytic Institute]].

Arlow was an editor of the ''[[Psychoanalytic Quarterly]]'' from 1972 to 1979; and published several articles on [[psychoanalysis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/163/9/1518|title=Jacob A. Arlow (1912–2004) |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]]|accessdate=2009-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as writing a history of psychoanalytic history,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=96989 Jacob A. Arlow]&lt;/ref&gt; and co-authoring with [[Charles Brenner (psychiatrist)|Charles Brenner]] the influential text ''Psychoanalytic Concepts and the Structural Theory''.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Malcolm, ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (London 1988) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fantasy and myth==

In perhaps his most significant theoretical contribution to psychoanalysis, Arlow explored the role of unconscious fantasy from the point of view of [[ego psychology]], both subsuming its use in [[Melanie Klein|Kleinian]] theory,&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Merker, ''Psychoanalytic Approaches to Myth'' (London 2005) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; and providing the building block for Brenner's later development of [[Psychoanalysis#Modern conflict theory|conflict theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Rothstein, ''Making Freud More Freudian'' (London 2010) p. ix-x&lt;/ref&gt;

His earlier article on 'Fantasy Systems in Twins' (1960) was used by [[Maynard Solomon]] to illuminate the inner development of [[Beethoven]], Arlow observing that the “bond of complete understanding which is missing with the parent unites the twins in the wish fantasy....The existence of another individual who is a reflection of the self brings the experience of twinship in line with the psychology of the double”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Maynard Solomon, ''Beethoven Essays'' (London 1988) p. 85 and p. 87-8&lt;/ref&gt;

He also explored the role of [[Mythology|myth]] in bridging the gap between individual instinctual conflicts and cultural ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Merker, p. 66-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalyitc limitations==

Arlow insisted on the limitations of psychoanalysis, inherent both in its technique and in the human experience itself, and warned against any quest for perfection through psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (London 2005) p. 262-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Heinz Kohut]] in his [[self psychology]] would challenge the Arlow/Brenner belief that [[narcissistic personality disorder]] could be understood within the methodology of the [[transference]] neurosis.&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Kohut, ''The Analysis of the Self'' (Madison 1971) p. 6n&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Latrepirdine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], also known as '''dimebolin''' and sold as '''Dimebon'''), is an [[antihistamine]] [[drug]] which has been used clinically in [[Russia]] since 1983.&lt;ref name="pmid6225678"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Matveeva IA | title = Action of dimebon on histamine receptors | journal = Farmakologiia i Toksikologiia |date=July–August 1983 | volume = 46 | issue = 4 | pages = 27–29 | language = Russian | pmid = 6225678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research was conducted in both Russia and western nations into potential applications as a neuroprotective drug to treat [[Alzheimer's disease]] and, possibly, as a [[nootropic]], as well.&lt;ref name="pmid16250325"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shevtsova EF, Kireeva EG, Bachurin SO | title = Mitochondria as the target for neuroprotectors | journal = Vestnik Rossiiskoi Akademii Meditsinskikh Nauk | year = 2005 | issue = 9 | pages = 13–17 | language = Russian | pmid = 16250325}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a  major phase III clinical trial for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment failed to show any benefit, three other AD trials continued.&lt;ref name=medpagetoday&gt;[http://www.medpagetoday.com/Neurology/AlzheimersDisease/18794 Novel Alzheimer's Drug Flops], ''MedPage Today'', March 03, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Major industry-based development in this indication essentially stopped after another Phase III trial suffered the same fate in 2012.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sweetlove M: Phase III CONCERT Trial of Latrepirdine. Negative results. Pharm Med 2012;26(2):113-115&lt;/ref&gt; Latrepirdine failed in the phase III trial for [[Huntington disease]].&lt;ref name=HD/&gt;

== Uses ==
Latrepirdine is an orally active, small molecule compound that has been shown to inhibit brain cell death in animal models of Alzheimer's disease and [[Huntington's disease]]. Research suggests it may also have cognition-enhancing effects in healthy individuals, in the absence of neurodegenerative disease pathology.&lt;ref name="pmid11462798"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bachurin S, Bukatina E, Lermontova N, Tkachenko S, Afanasiev A, Grigoriev V, Grigorieva I, Ivanov Y, Sablin S, Zefirov N | title = Antihistamine agent Dimebon as a novel neuroprotector and a cognition enhancer | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |date=June 2001 | volume = 939  | issue = |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03654.x| pages = 425–435 | pmid = 11462798}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of negative results in human clinical trials, the drug remains unlicensed for any neurodegenerative condition.&lt;ref name=medpagetoday /&gt;&lt;ref name=HD/&gt;

=== Alzheimer's disease: failed in Phase III clinical trials ===

Latrepirdine attracted renewed interest in 2009 after being shown in small preclinical trials to have positive effects on persons suffering from [[Alzheimer's]] disease. Animal studies showing potential beneficial effects on Alzheimer's disease models were shown in Russian research in 2000.&lt;ref name="pmid11022244"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lermontova NN, Lukoyanov NV, Serkova TP, Lukoyanova EA, Bachurin SO | title = Dimebon improves learning in animals with experimental Alzheimer's disease | journal = Bulletin of Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=June 2000 | volume = 129 | issue = 6 | pages = 544–546 | pmid = 11022244 | doi=10.1007/BF02434871}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary results from human trials have also been promising. In an initial six-month phase II trial, results have shown significant improvement over placebo at 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Antihistamine Shows Promise in Treating Alzheimer's | publisher = New York Times | date = 2007-06-11 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/11/business/11drug.html?ei=5090&amp;en=6dd260f0ecf61466&amp;ex=1339214400&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=print | first=Andrew | last=Pollack | accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latrepirdine showed promising results in a phase III-equivalent, double-blind trial in Russia with mild–moderate stage patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Phend Crystal |author2=Jasmer Robert | date = 2008-07-17 | title = Old Antihistamine Pops Up as Potential Alzheimer's Therapy | url = http://www.medpagetoday.com/Geriatrics/AlzheimersDisease/tb/10174  | journal = Medpage Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18640457"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Effect of dimebon on cognition, activities of daily living, behaviour, and global function in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study  |vauthors=Doody Rachelle S, etal | journal = Lancet | date = 2008-07-19 | volume = 372 | issue = 9634 | pages = 207–215 | pmid = 18640457 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61074-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, Pfizer and Medivation initiated a phase III trial (CONCERT study) aiming for FDA approval.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS117499+15-Apr-2009+PRN20090415
"Pfizer and Medivation Initiate Phase 3 Trial of Dimebon Added to Donepezil in
Patients with Alzheimer's Disease" Apr 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2010, Pfizer announced that this clinical trial failed to show any benefit for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease patients.&lt;ref name=medpagetoday/&gt;

Numerous phase III trials for AD were recruiting in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00838110 "A Phase 3 Study To Evaluate The Safety And Tolerability Of Dimebon Patients With Mild To Moderate Alzheimer's Disease"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00912288 "A Phase 3 Efficacy Study Of Dimebon In Patients With Moderate To Severe Alzheimer's Disease"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00939783 "An Extension To The B1451027 Protocol To Evaluate The Long Term Safety And Tolerability Of Dimebon In Patients With Alzheimer's Disease"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00954590 "A Safety and Efficacy Study Evaluating Dimebon (Latrepirdine) in Patients With Moderate to Severe Alzheimer's Disease (CONTACT)"&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, Pfizer and Medivation announced that "latrepirdine" was to be the proposed [[International Nonproprietary Name|international nonproprietary name]] for latrepirdine for the treatment of Alzheimer's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Pfizer And Medivation Initiate Phase 3 Trial Of Dimebon In Patients With Huntington Disease | publisher = Pfizer Inc. | date = 2009-07-30 | url = http://newsblaze.com/story/2009073005345800002.bw/topstory.html | accessdate = July 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, the results of a clinical trial phase III were released; the investigational Alzheimer's disease drug dimebon failed in the pivotal CONNECTION trial of patients with mild-to-moderate disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=2387|title=Dimebon Disappoints in Phase 3 Trial - ALZFORUM|author=|date=|website=www.alzforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With CONCERT, the remaining Pfizer and Medivation Phase III trial for latrepirdine in Alzheimer's disease failed in 2012, effectively ending the development in this indication.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A Cochrane meta-analysis of the three pivotal phase III efficacy trials found no significant effect of latrepirdine on cognition and function in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's patients, though there appears to be a modest benefit for overall behavior disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chau|first1=Sarah A|last2=Herrmann|first2=Nathan|last3=Ruthirakuhan|first3=Myuri T|last4=Chen|first4=Jinghan J|last5=Lanctôt|first5=Krista L|title=Latrepirdine for Alzheimer's disease|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|date=2015|issue=4|page=CD009524|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009524.pub2|pmid=25897825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Huntington's disease ===
In April 2011, latrepirdine failed in a phase III clinical trial of patients affected with Huntington's disease.&lt;ref name=HD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/phase-iii-failure-leads-medivation-and-pfizer-to-ditch-dimebon-for-huntington-disease/81244981/|title=Phase III Failure Leads Medivation and Pfizer to Ditch Dimebon for Huntington Disease - GEN|author=|date=|website=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial was sponsored  by Medivation Inc. and [[Pfizer]].

== Pharmacology ==
Latrepirdine appears to operate through multiple mechanisms of action, both blocking the action of neurotoxic [[beta-amyloid]] proteins and inhibiting L-type [[calcium channels]],&lt;ref name="pmid11865327"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lermontova NN, Redkozubov AE, Shevtsova EF, Serkova TP, Kireeva EG, Bachurin SO | title = Dimebon and tacrine inhibit neurotoxic action of beta-amyloid in culture and block L-type Ca(2+) channels | journal = Bulletin of Experimental Biology and Medicine |date=November 2001 | volume = 132 | issue = 5 | pages = 1079–1083 | pmid = 11865327 | doi = 10.1023/A:1017972709652}}&lt;/ref&gt; modulating the action of [[AMPA receptor|AMPA]] and [[NMDA receptor|NMDA]] [[glutamate receptor]]s,&lt;ref name="pmid14968164"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grigorev VV, Dranyi OA, Bachurin SO | title = Comparative study of action mechanisms of dimebon and memantine on AMPA- and NMDA-subtypes glutamate receptors in rat cerebral neurons | journal = Bull Exp Biol Med |date=November 2003 | volume = 136 | issue = 5 | pages = 474–477 | pmid = 14968164 | doi=10.1023/B:BEBM.0000017097.75818.14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may exert a neuroprotective effect by blocking a novel target that involves [[Mitochondrial permeability pore|mitochondrial pores]],&lt;ref name="pmid12853325"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bachurin SO, Shevtsova EP, Kireeva EG, Oxenkrug GF, Sablin SO | title = Mitochondria as a target for neurotoxins and neuroprotective agents | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 993 | issue = | pages = 334–44; discussion 345–9 |date=May 2003 | pmid = 12853325 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2003.tb07541.x| url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/resolve/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0077-8923&amp;date=2003&amp;volume=993&amp;spage=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are believed to play a role in the cell death that is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and the aging process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | date = 2007-06-11 | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/06-11-2007/0004605280&amp;EDATE= | title = Medivation's Dimebon(TM) Maintains Statistically Significant Benefit on All Five Efficacy Endpoints in Alzheimer's Disease Trial After One Year of Therapy

{{main article|Universal health care}}

[[Universal health coverage]] is a broad concept that has been implemented in several ways.  The common denominator for all such programs is some form of government action aimed at extending access to health care as widely as possible and setting minimum standards. Most implement universal health care through legislation, regulation and taxation. Legislation and regulation direct what care must be provided, to whom, and on what basis. 

Usually some costs are borne by the patient at the time of consumption but the bulk of costs come from a combination of compulsory insurance and tax revenues. Some programs are paid for entirely out of tax revenues. In others tax revenues are used either to fund insurance for the very poor or for those needing long term chronic care. In some cases, government involvement also includes directly managing the [[health care system]], but many countries use mixed public-private systems to deliver universal health care.

The UN has adopted a resolution on universal health care. It may be the next stage after the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= UN adopts 'momentous' resolution on universal healthcare |url= https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/dec/13/un-momentous-resolution-universal-healthcare |location= London |work=The Guardian |first=Mark |last=Tran |agency=Global development, Health (Society), Society, United Nations (News), World news |date=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==

===Algeria===
[[Algeria]] operates a public healthcare system. It is a universal healthcare system as well. A network of hospitals, clinics, and dispensaries provide treatment to the population, with the Social Security system funding health services, although many people must still cover part of their costs due to the rates paid by the Social Security system unchanged since 1987. The poor are generally entitled to health services free of charge, while the wealthy pay for treatment according to a sliding scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/algeria/68.htm |title=Algeria – Health And Welfare |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marines.mil/Portals/59/Publications/Algeria%20Profile.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Botswana===
{{Main article|Health in Botswana}}

[[Botswana]] operates a system of public medical centers, with 98% of health facilities in the country run by the government. All citizens are entitled to be treated in public facilities free of charge, though a nominal fee of ~70 BWP (~$6.60 USD) is typically charged for public health services except for sexual reproductive health services and antiretroviral therapy services, which are free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aho.afro.who.int/profiles_information/index.php/Botswana:The_Health_System|title=Botswana:The Health System - AHO|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burkina Faso===
[[Burkina Faso]] provides universal healthcare to citizens through a system called Universal Health Insurance (AMU)—administered by two bodies, one for civilians and the other for the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jointlearningnetwork.org/news/burkina-faso-adopts-universal-health-insurance-system|title=Burkina Faso adopts universal health insurance system - Joint Learning Network|first=|last=JLN|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Egypt}}

[[Egypt]] operates a system of public hospitals and clinics through the Ministry of Health. Egyptian citizens can receive treatment at these facilities free of charge. However, those Egyptians who can afford it prefer to pay out of pocket for private healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justlanded.com/english/Egypt/Egypt-Guide/Health/Insurance|title=Insurance|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ghana===
[[Ghana]] operates the [[National Health Insurance Scheme (Ghana)|National Health Insurance Scheme]] to provide citizens with health insurance. The level of premiums citizens must pay varies according to their level of income. Most medical facilities are run directly by the [[Ministry of Health (Ghana)|Ministry of Health]] or [[Ghana Health Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhis.gov.gh/|title=NHIS - Your Access to Healthcare|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morocco===
[[Morocco]] operates a public health sector run by the government that operates 85% of the country's hospital beds. It deals mainly with the poor and rural populations, who cannot afford private healthcare. In addition, a non-profit health sector operated by the National Social Security Fund covers 16% of the population. Private medical care is available for those who can afford it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equityhealthj.com/content/5/1/1 |title=International Journal for Equity in Health &amp;#124; Full text &amp;#124; Social inequalities and health inequity in Morocco |publisher=Equityhealthj.com |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rwanda===
{{Main|Healthcare in Rwanda}}

[[Rwanda]] operates a system of universal health insurance through the Ministry of Health called Mutuelle de Santé (Mutual Health), a system of community-based insurance where people pay premiums based on their income level into local health insurance funds, with the wealthiest paying the highest premiums and required to cover a small percentage of their medical expenses, while those at the lowest income levels are exempt from paying premiums and can still utilize the services of their local health fund. In 2012, this system insured all but 4% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/rwandas-health-care-miracle/?_r=0 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203090417/http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/rwandas-health-care-miracle/?_r=0 |archivedate=2014-02-03 |title=In Rwanda, Health Care Coverage That Eludes the U.S. |publisher=''Opinionator'' (blog of ''[[The New York Times]]'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bhutan===
{{Main article|Health in Bhutan}}

The Royal Government of Bhutan maintains a policy of free and universal access to primary health care. As hospital facilities in the country are limited, patients with diseases that cannot be treated in Bhutan, such as cancer, are normally referred to hospitals in India for treatment. Such referral treatment is also carried out at the cost of the Royal Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Health System Profile: Bhutan| publisher = [[World Health Organization]] |url=http://www.searo.who.int/EN/Section313/Section1517_10764.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601050957/http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section313/Section1517_10764.htm |archivedate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{Main article|Healthcare in India}}

India's healthcare system is dominated by the private sector, although there are various public healthcare systems like [[Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee Arogya Yojana]] in [[Maharashtra]] that provides free healthcare to those below the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/324487/modis-ambitious-health-policy-may-dwarf-obamacare/|title=Modi’s ambitious health policy may dwarf Obamacare|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee Arogya Yojana|url=https://www.jeevandayee.gov.in/RGJAY/|work=[[Government of Maharashtra]]|date=16 January 2016|accessdate=16 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127080853/https://www.jeevandayee.gov.in/RGJAY/|archivedate=January 27, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the majority of Indian citizens do not have health insurance, and must pay out of pocket for treatment. There are government hospitals that provide treatment at taxpayer expense. Some essential drugs are offered free of charge in these hospitals.

An outpatient card at [[AIIMS]] costs a one-time fee of 10 rupees (around 20 cents U.S.) and thereafter outpatient medical advice is free. In-hospital treatment costs depend on the financial condition of the patient and the facilities utilized, but are usually much less than the private sector. For instance, a patient is waived treatment costs if their income is below the poverty line. However, getting treatment at high quality government hospitals is very tough due to the high number of people needing healthcare and the lack of sufficient facilities.

Primary health care is provided by city and district hospitals and rural primary health centres (PHCs). These hospitals provide treatment free of cost, but only if they are functional. Primary care is focused on immunization, prevention of malnutrition, pregnancy, child birth, postnatal care, and treatment of common illnesses.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Patients who receive specialized care or have complicated illnesses are referred to secondary (often located in [[Districts of India|district]] and [[Tehsil|taluk]] headquarters) and tertiary care hospitals (located in district and state headquarters or those that are teaching hospitals).{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Now organizations like Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotional Trust and other private organizations have started creating hospitals and clinics in India, which also provide free or subsidized health care and subsidized insurance plans.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The government-run healthcare suffers from a lack of hygiene; the rich avoid the government hospitals and go to private hospitals. With the advent of privatized healthcare, this situation has changed. India now has medical tourism for people from other countries while its own poor find high-quality healthcare either inaccessible or unaffordable.

The current Indian government is planning to unveil a national universal healthcare system called the National Health Assurance Mission, which will provide all Indian citizens with insurance coverage for serious illnesses, and free drugs and diagnostic treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/10/30/uk-india-health-idINKBN0IJ0VN20141030|title=India's universal healthcare rollout to cost $26 billion|first=Aditya|last=Kalra|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
{{Main article|Health care in Israel}}
[[File:Israeli Health Care Spending as a Percentage of GDP.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Health care in Israel as a percentage of GDP]]

Israel has a system of universal healthcare as set out by the 1995 National Health Insurance Law. The state is responsible for providing health services to all residents of the country, who can register with one of the four national health service funds. To be eligible, a citizen must pay a health insurance tax. Coverage includes medical diagnosis and treatment, preventive medicine, hospitalization (general, maternity, psychiatric and chronic), surgery and transplants, preventive dental care for children, first aid and transportation to a hospital or clinic, medical services at the workplace, treatment for drug abuse and alcoholism, medical equipment and appliances, obstetrics and fertility treatment, medication, treatment of chronic diseases and paramedical services such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = history of Israel health care| url = http://www.israel.org/MFA/History/Modern%20History/Israel%20at%2050/The%20Health%20Care%20System%20in%20Israel-%20An%20Historical%20Pe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel, the ''National Health Insurance Law'' (or ''National Health Insurance Act'') is the legal framework that enables and facilitates basic, compulsory universal health care. The [[Knesset]] put the law into effect on January 1, 1995—basing it on recommendations from a National Committee of Inquiry headed by [[Shoshana Netanyahu]], which examined restructuring the health care system in Israel in the late 1980s. Prior to the law's passage, over 90% of the population was already covered by voluntarily belonging to one of four nationwide, not-for-profit sickness funds. These operated some of their own medical facilities, funded in part by employers and the government, and in part by the insured via levies that varied according to income. However, there were three problems associated with this arrangement. First, membership in the largest fund, [[Clalit]], required one to belong to the [[Histadrut]] labor organization, even if a person did not want to (or could not) have such an affiliation, and other funds restricted entry to new members based on age, pre-existing conditions, or other factors. Second, different funds provided different levels of benefit coverage or services to their members. Lastly, some of the population, albeit a small percentage, had no health insurance.

Before the law went into effect, all the funds collected premiums directly from members. However, upon passage of the law, a new progressive national health insurance tax was levied through [[Bituah Leumi]] (Israel's [[social security]] agency), which then re-distributes the proceeds to the sickness funds based on their membership and its demographic makeup. This ensured that ''all'' citizens would now have health coverage. While membership in one of the funds now became compulsory for all, free choice was introduced into movement of members between funds (a change is allowed once every six months), effectively making the various sickness funds compete equally for members among the populace. Annually, a committee appointed by the ministry of health publishes a "basket" or uniform package of medical services and prescription [[Formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]] that all funds must provide as a minimum to all members. Achieving this level of equality guaranteed basic healthcare regardless of fund affiliation, which was one of the principal aims of the law. An appeals process handles rejection of treatments and procedures by the funds and evaluates cases that fall outside the "basket" of services or prescription formulary.

The law is generally considered a success, and Israeli citizens enjoy a high standard of medical care comparatively, with more competition in the country's health care, and order has been brought to what was once a somewhat disorganized system—however, the law has its critics. First among the criticisms is that the "basket" may not provide enough coverage. To partly address this, the HMOs and insurance companies began offering "supplementary" insurance to cover certain additional services not in the basket. However, since this insurance is optional (though usually very modestly priced, costing the equivalent of about US$10 to $20 a month), critics argue that it goes against the spirit of the new law, which stressed equality of healthcare for all citizens. Another criticism is that, to provide universal coverage to all, the tax income base amount (the maximum amount of yearly earnings that are subject to the tax) was set rather high, causing many high-income taxpayers to see the amount they pay for their health premiums (now health tax) skyrocket. Finally, some complain about the constantly rising costs of [[copayment]]s for certain services.

===People's Republic of China===
{{Main article|Healthcare reform in China}}

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the goal of health care programs has been to provide care to every member of the population and to make maximum use of limited health-care personnel, equipment, and financial resources.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

China is undertaking a reform on its health care system, which was largely privatized in the 1990s. The New Rural Co-operative Medical Care System (NRCMCS), is a new 2005 initiative to overhaul the healthcare system, particularly intended to make it more affordable for the rural poor. Under the NRCMCS, the annual cost of medical coverage is 50 yuan (US$7) per person. Of that, 20 yuan is paid in by the central government, 20 yuan by the provincial government and a contribution of 10 yuan is made by the patient. As of September 2007, around 80% of the whole rural population of China had signed up (about 685 million people). The system is tiered, depending on the location. If patients go to a small hospital or clinic in their local town, the scheme covers from 70–80% of their bill. If they go to a county one, the percentage of the cost being covered falls to about 60%. And if they need specialist help in a large modern city hospital, they have to bear most of the cost themselves, the scheme would cover about 30% of the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Carrin G |title=The reform of the rural cooperative medical system in the People's Republic of China: interim experience in 14 pilot counties |journal=Soc Sci Med |volume=48 |issue=7 |pages=961–72 |date=April 1999 |pmid=10192562 |doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(98)00396-7 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277953698003967|name-list-format=vanc|author2=Ron A|author3=Hui Y|display-authors=3|last4=Hong|first4=Wang|last5=Tuohong|first5=Zhang|last6=Licheng|first6=Zhang|last7=Shuo|first7=Zhang|last8=Yide|first8=Ye|last9=Jiaying|first9=Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 21, 2009, the Chinese government announced it would provide 850 billion yuan (US$127.5 billion) between 2009 and 2011 to improve the existing health care system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.formosapost.com/healthcare-reform-in-china/ 3年內醫改投入8500億]. Retrieved January 21, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2008, the government published its reform plan clarifying government's responsibility by saying that it would play a dominant role in providing public health and basic medical service. It declared "Both central and local governments should increase health funding. The percentage of government's input in total health expenditure should be increased gradually so that the financial burden of individuals can be reduced,"  The plan listed public health, rural areas, city community health services and basic medical insurance as four key areas for government investment. It also promised to tighten government control over medical fees in public hospitals and to set up a "basic medicine system" to quell public complaints of rising drug costs.&lt;ref name="china.org.cn"&gt;Staff (October 14, 2008).

The plan was passed by the Chinese Cabinet in January 2009.

Singapore has a universal health care system where government ensures affordability, largely through compulsory savings and price controls, while the private sector provides most care. Overall spending on health care amounts to only 3% of annual GDP. Of that, 66% comes from private sources.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whosis/database/core/core_select.cfm |title=World Health Organization Statistical Information System: Core Health Indicators |publisher=Who.int |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore currently has the second lowest infant mortality rate in the world and among the highest life expectancies from birth, according to the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/entity/whosis/whostat2007_1mortality.pdf "World Health Statistics 2007: Mortality"], based on 2005 data.&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore has "one of the most successful healthcare systems in the world, in terms of both efficiency in financing and the results achieved in community health outcomes," according to an analysis by global consulting firm [[Watson Wyatt Worldwide|Watson Wyatt]].&lt;ref name="Watson Wyatt Singapore"/&gt; Singapore's system uses a combination of compulsory savings from payroll deductions (funded by both employers and workers) a nationalized health insurance plan, and government subsidies, as well as "actively regulating the supply and prices of healthcare services in the country" to keep costs in check; the specific features have been described as potentially a "very difficult system to replicate in many other countries." Many Singaporeans also have supplemental private health insurance (often provided by employers) for services not covered by the government's programs.&lt;ref name="Watson Wyatt Singapore"&gt;John Tucci, [http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850 "The Singapore health system – achieving positive health outcomes with low expenditure"], Watson Wyatt Healthcare Market Review, October 2004. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419231253/http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850 |date=April 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Healthcare in Taiwan}}

The current health care system in Taiwan, known as National Health Insurance (NHI), was instituted in 1995. NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan that centralizes the disbursement of health care dollars. The system promises equal access to health care for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99% by the end of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Fanchiang, Cecilia (January 2, 2004).  [http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=20439&amp;CtNode=122 "New IC health insurance card expected to offer many benefits"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606010447/http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=20439&amp;CtNode=122 |date=June 6, 2008 }}. ''[[Taiwan Journal]]''. Retrieved March 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; NHI is mainly financed through premiums based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket payments and direct government funding. In the initial stage, fee-for-service predominated for both public and private providers.

NHI delivers universal coverage offered by a government-run insurer. The working population pays premiums split with their employers, others pay a flat rate with government help and the poor or veterans are fully subsidized.&lt;ref name=NPRart&gt;{{Cite news|title = Taiwan Takes Fastrack to Universal Health Care| url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89651916| publisher = All Things Considered, NPR| date = April 15, 2008 | accessdate = October 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this model, citizens have free range to choose hospitals and physicians without using a gatekeeper and do not have to worry about waiting lists. NHI offers a comprehensive benefit package that covers preventive medical services, prescription drugs, [[Dentistry|dental]] services, [[Chinese medicine]], home nurse visits and many more. Since NHI, the previously uninsured have increased their usage of medical services. Most preventive services are free such as annual checkups and maternal and child care. Regular office visits have co-payments as low as US $5 per visit. Co-payments are fixed and unvaried by the person's income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| journal = [[Health Affairs]] | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 77–88 | year = 2003 | doi = 10.1377/hlthaff.22.3.77 | title = Does Universal Health Insurance Make Health Care Unaffordable?

===Thailand===
{{Main article|Health in Thailand}}

Thailand introduced universal coverage reforms in 2001, becoming one of only a handful of lower-middle income countries to do so at the time. Means-tested health care for low income households was replaced by a new and more comprehensive insurance scheme, originally known as the 30 baht project, in line with the small co-payment charged for treatment. People joining the scheme receive a gold card that they use to access services in their health district, and, if necessary, get referrals for specialist treatment elsewhere. The bulk of finance comes from public revenues, with funding allocated to Contracting Units for Primary Care annually on a population basis. According to the WHO, 65% of Thailand's health care expenditure in 2004 came from the government, 35% was from private sources.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS"/&gt; Although the reforms have received a good deal of critical comment, they have proved popular with poorer Thais, especially in rural areas, and survived the change of government after the 2006 military coup. The then Public Health Minister, Mongkol Na Songkhla, abolished the 30 baht co-payment and made the UC scheme free. It is not yet clear whether the scheme will be modified further under the coalition government that came to power in January 2008.&lt;ref name="G20"&gt;G20 Health Care: "Health Care Systems and Health Market Reform in the G20 Countries."

===Belgium===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Belgium}}

Healthcare in [[Belgium]] is composed of three parts. Firstly there is a primarily publicly funded healthcare and social security service run by the federal government, which organises and regulates [[healthcare]]; independent private/public practitioners, university/semi-private hospitals and care institutions. There are a few (commercially run [[for-profit]]) [[private hospital]]s.&lt;ref name="Corens2007"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Health Systems in Transition |volume=9 |year=2007 |title=Belgium, health system review |author=Corens, Dirk |publisher=European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies |url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/96442/E90059.pdf |format=PDF|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly is the insurance coverage provided for patients. Finally, industry coverage covers the production and distribution of healthcare products for research and development. The primary aspect of this research is done in [[University|universities]] and [[hospital]]s.

===Croatia===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Croatia}}

Croatia has a [[universal health care]] system that provides high quality medical services and is coordinated by the [[Ministry of Health (Croatia)|Ministry of Health]]. The population is covered by a basic health insurance plan provided by statute and optional insurance and administered by the [[Croatian Health Insurance Fund]]. In 2012, annual compulsory healthcare related expenditures reached 21.0 billion kunas (c. 2.8 billion euro). There are hundreds of healthcare institutions in Croatia, including 79 hospitals and clinics with 25,285 beds, caring for more than 760 thousand patients per year, 5,792 private practice offices and 79 emergency medical service units.

===Czech Republic===
{{Main article|Healthcare in the Czech Republic}}

Czech Republic has a universal public health system paid largely from taxation. Private health care systems do co-exist freely alongside public ones, sometimes offering better quality or faster service. Almost all medical services are covered by health insurance and insurance companies, though certain services such as prescription drugs or vision and dental care are only covered partially.

===Denmark===
{{Main article|Health care in Denmark}}

Denmark has a universal public health system paid largely from taxation with local municipalities delivering health care services in the same way as other Scandinavian countries. Primary care is provided by a general practitioner service run by private doctors contracting with the local municipalities with payment on a mixed per capita and fee for service basis. Most hospitals are run by the municipalities (only 1% of hospital beds are in the private sector).

===Finland===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Finland}}

In Finland, public medical services at clinics and hospitals are run by the municipalities (local government) and are funded 76% by taxation, 20% by patients through access charges, and 4% by others. Private provision is mainly in the primary care sector. There are a few private hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kela.fi/in/internet/english.nsf/NET/210806144050AK |title=KELA – Use of European Health Insurance Card in Finland |publisher=Kela.fi |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main hospitals are either municipally owned (funded from local taxes) or run by the medical teaching universities (funded jointly by the municipalities and the national government). According to a survey published by the European Commission in 2000, Finland's is in the top 4 of EU countries in terms of satisfaction with their hospital care system: 88% of Finnish respondents were satisfied compared with the EU average of 41.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_283_en.pdf |title=European Commission: Health and long-term care in the European Union |format=PDF |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finnish health care expenditures are below the European average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/80692/E91937.pdf |title=Health Systems in Transition Vol. 10 No. 4 2008; Finland health system review |format=PDF |accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The private medical sector accounts for about 14 percent of total health care spending. Only 8% of doctors choose to work in private practice, and some of these also choose to do some work in the public sector.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Taxation funding is partly local and partly nationally based. The national social insurance institution [[KELA (Finnish Social Insurance)|KELA]] reimburses part of patients prescription costs and makes a contribution towards private medical costs (including [[dentistry]]) if they choose to be treated in the private sector rather than the public sector. Patient access charges are subject to annual caps. For example, [[General practitioner|GP]] visits cost €11 per visit with annual €33 cap; hospital outpatient treatment €22 per visit; a hospital stay, including food, medical care and medicines €26 per 24 hours, or €12 if in a psychiatric hospital. After a patient has spent €590 per year on public medical services (including prescription drugs), all treatment and medications thereafter in that year are free.

Finland has a highly decentralized three-level public system of health care and alongside this, a much smaller private health-care system.&lt;ref name=HCSIT-Finland&gt;{{Cite web

Overall, the municipalities (funded by taxation, local and national) meet about two thirds of all medical-care costs, with the remaining one third paid by the national insurance system (nationally funded), and by private finance (either employer-funded or met by patients themselves).&lt;ref name="HCSIT-Finland" /&gt;
Private inpatient care forms about 3–4% of all inpatient care.&lt;ref name="HCSIT-Finland" /&gt;  In 1999 only 17 per cent of total funding for health care came from insurance, comprising 14.9% statutory (government) insurance and 2.1% private health insurance. Spectacles are not publicly subsidized at all, although dentistry is available as a municipal service or can be obtained privately with partial reimbursement from the state.&lt;ref name="HCSIT-Finland" /&gt; The government announced in 2009 that [[Kela (Finnish)|Kela]] would re-imburse the cost of private dental-hygiene work, starting in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Kela publication to all households 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The percentage of total health expenditure financed by taxation in Finland (78%)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/52/33/38976604.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is above the OECD average and similar to the levels seen in Germany (77%) and France (80%) but below the level seen in the UK (87%).  The quality of service in Finnish health care, as measured by patient satisfaction, is excellent. According to a survey published by the European Commission in 2000, Finland has one of the highest ratings of patient satisfaction with their hospital care system in the EU: 88% of Finnish respondents were satisfied compared with the EU average of 41.3%.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_283_en.pdf European Commission: Health and long-term care in the European Union&lt;/ref&gt;

There are caps on total medical expenses that are met out-of-pocket for drugs and hospital treatments. The National Insurance system pays all necessary costs over these caps. Public spending on health care in 2006 was 13.6 billion euros (equivalent to US$338 per person per month). The increase over 2005 at 8.2 per cent was below the OECD average of 9 percent. Household budgets directly met 18.7 per cent of all health-care costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/oikea/id88679.html "News item on healthcare costs in 2006 (in Finnish)"].&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
{{Main article|Health care in France}}

France has a system of universal health care largely financed by government through a system of [[national health insurance]]. Nonetheless, not all medical care is paid for by the state, with only 70% of initial GP care covered and anywhere between 35% and 100% of prescription medication covered. It is consistently ranked as one of the best in the world.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2000/media_centre/press_release/en/ |title=World Health Organization Assesses the World's Health Systems |publisher=Who.int |date=8 December 2010 |accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 92% of the population is covered by a 'Statutory Health Insurance' plan, which provides a standardized level of coverage through any one of approximately 1100 public or private sickness funds. Standard insurance is funded by a combination of employee contributions, employer contributions and government subsidies on a scale determined by income level. Higher income workers sometimes choose to pay a tax and opt out of the standard plan, in favor of 'private' insurance.  The latter's premiums are not linked to income level but instead to health status.&lt;ref name="GK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finanztip.de/web/abc-der-krankenkassen/|title=Finanztip : Finanztip – Das gemeinnützige Verbraucherportal|first=Finanztip Verbraucherinformation gemeinnützige|last=GmbH|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601021121/http://www.finanztip.de/web/abc-der-krankenkassen/|archivedate=June 1, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the level of provider reimbursement for specific services is determined through negotiations between regional physician's associations and sickness funds. Since 1976 the government has convened an annual commission, composed of representatives of business, labor, physicians, hospitals, and insurance and pharmaceutical industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1215/03616878-15-1-69 |author=Kirkman-Liff BL |title=Physician Payment and Cost-Containment Strategies in West Germany: Suggestions for Medicare Reform |journal=Journal of Health Care Politics, Policy and Law (Duke University) |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=69–99 |year=1990 |pmid=2108202}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The commission takes into account government policies and makes recommendations to regional associations with respect to overall expenditure targets. In 1986 expenditure caps were implemented and were tied to the age of the local population as well as the overall wage increases. Although reimbursement of providers is on a fee-for-service basis the amount to be reimbursed for each service is determined retrospectively to ensure that spending targets are not exceeded. Capitated care, such as that provided by U.S. health maintenance organizations, has been considered as a cost containment mechanism but would require consent of regional medical associations, and has not materialized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Henke KD |title=[External and internal financing in health care] |language=German |journal=Med.

Drug costs have increased substantially, rising nearly 60% from 1991 through 2005. Despite attempts to contain costs, overall health care expenditures rose to 10.7% of GDP in 2005, comparable to other western European nations, but substantially less than that spent in the U.S. (nearly 16% of GDP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Borger C |title=Health spending projections through 2015: changes on the horizon |journal=Health Aff (Millwood) |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=w61–73 |year=2006 |pmid=16495287 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.25.w61|name-list-format=vanc|author2=Smith S|author3=Truffer C|display-authors=3|last4=Keehan|first4=S.|last5=Sisko|first5=A.|last6=Poisal|first6=J.|last7=Clemens|first7=M.

The public [[health care system]] of the Republic of Ireland is governed by the Health Act 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/plweb-cgi/fastweb?state_id=1207659918&amp;view=ag-view&amp;docrank=4&amp;numhitsfound=195&amp;query_rule=%28%28$query3%29%29%3Alegtitle&amp;query3=Health%20Act&amp;docid=66616&amp;docdb=Acts&amp;dbname=Acts&amp;dbname=SIs&amp;sorting=none&amp;operator=and&amp;TemplateName=predoc.tmpl&amp;setCookie=1 |title=Health Act 2004 |work=Irish Statute Book |publisher=Office of the Attorney General |accessdate=October 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which established a new body to be responsible for providing health and personal social services to everyone living in Ireland – the [[Health Service Executive]]. The new national health service came into being officially on January 1, 2005; however, the new structures are currently in the process of being established as the reform program continues. In addition to the public-sector, there is a large private health care market.

In Ireland, 37% of the population have a means tested medical card that gives the holder access to tax-funded GP care and requires €2.50 for each prescription drug.&lt;ref&gt;https://health.gov.ie/blog/publications/health-in-ireland-key-trends-2016/&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise the average price for an appointment with a family doctor is €50.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/cost-of-gp-visit-varies-from-30-to-65-across-state-1.1860540&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isle of Man===

===Italy===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Italy}}

Italy has a public health care service for all the residents called "Servizio Sanitario Nazionale" or SSN (National Health Service). It is similar to the UK National Health Service. It is publicly run and funded mostly from taxation. Some services require variable co-pays, while other services (like emergency medicine and a general doctor) are free. Like the UK, there is a small parallel private health care system, especially in the field of [[Dental Medicine]] and [[Ophthalmology]].

===Luxembourg===
Luxembourg provides universal health care coverage to all residents (Luxembourgers and foreigners) by the National Health Insurance (CNS - ''Caisse nationale de santé'' (French) or ''National Gesondheetskeess'' (Luxembourgish)). It is funded by mandatory contributions of employers and the workforce, and by government subsidies for insuring jobseekers, the poor, and for financing medical infrastructure. The nation also has mandatory public long-term care insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life rsciences &amp; health care in Luxembourg|url=http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_LU/lu/industries/lshc/lshc-luxembourg/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Législation-Code de la sécurité sociale &amp; Statuts de la Caisse nationale de santé|url=http://www.cns.lu/?p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
{{Main article|Healthcare in the Netherlands}}

The Netherlands has a dual-level system. All primary and [[curative care]] (family doctors, hospitals, and clinics) is financed from private compulsory insurance. Long term care for the elderly, the dying, the long term mentally ill etc. is covered by [[social insurance]] funded from taxation. According to the WHO, the health care system in the Netherlands was 62% government funded and 38% privately funded as of 2004.&lt;ref name=WHOSIS/&gt;

Insurance companies must offer a core universal insurance package for universal primary, curative care, including the cost of all prescription medicines. They must do this at a fixed price for all. People pay the same premium whether young or old, healthy or sick. It is illegal in The Netherlands for insurers to refuse an application for health insurance, to impose special conditions (e.g., exclusions, deductibles, co-pays etc., or refuse to fund treatments that a doctor has determined are medically necessary). The system is 50% financed from payroll taxes paid by employers to a fund controlled by the Health regulator. The government contributes an additional 5% to the regulator's fund. The remaining 45% is collected as premiums paid by the insured directly to the insurance company. Some employers negotiate bulk deals with health insurers and some even pay the employees' premiums as an employment benefit. All insurance companies receive additional funding from the regulator's fund. The regulator has sight of the claims made by policyholders and therefore can redistribute the funds its holds on the basis of relative claims made by policy holders. Thus insurers with high payouts receive more from the regulator than those with low payouts. Insurance companies have no incentive to deter high cost individuals from taking insurance and are compensated if they have to pay out more than might be expected. Insurance companies compete with each other on price for the 45% direct premium part of the funding and try to negotiate deals with hospitals to keep costs low and quality high. The competition regulator is charged with checking for abuse of dominant market positions and the creation of cartels that act against the consumer interests. An insurance regulator ensures that all basic policies have identical coverage rules so that no person is medically disadvantaged by his or her choice of insurer.

Hospitals in the Netherlands are also regulated and inspected but are mostly privately run and not for profit, as are many of the insurance companies. Patients can choose where they want to be treated, and have access to information on the internet about the performance and waiting times at each hospital. Patients dissatisfied with their insurer and choice of hospital can cancel at any time, but must make a new agreement with another insurer.

Insurance companies can offer additional services at extra cost over and above the universal system laid down by the regulator, e.g., for dental care. The standard monthly premium for health care paid by individual adults is about €100 per month. Persons on low incomes can get assistance from the government if they cannot afford these payments. Children under 18 are insured by the system at no additional cost to them or their families because the insurance company receives the cost of this from the regulator's fund. There is a fixed yearly threshold of €375 for each adult person, excluding first visits for diagnosis to general physicians.

===Norway===
{{main article|Healthcare in Norway}}

Norway has a universal public health system paid largely from taxation in the same way as other Scandinavian countries. Norway's entire population has equal access to health care services. The Norwegian health care system is government-funded and heavily decentralized. The health care system in Norway is financed primarily through taxes levied by county councils and municipalities. Dental care is included for children until 18 years old, and is covered for adults for some ailments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://helsenorge.no/who-pays-your-dental-bill|title = Who Pays Your Dental Bill?|date = |accessdate = |website = Helsenorge|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norway regularly comes top or close to the top of worldwide healthcare rankings.

===Portugal===
{{Main article|Health in Portugal}}

Portugal's National Healthcare Service, known nationally as Serviço Nacional de Saúde (SNS), is a universal and free healthcare service provided nationwide since 1979 and available to both Portuguese and foreign residents. In 2014, Portugal SNS ranked 13th best healthcare service in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthpowerhouse.com/files/EHCI_2014/EHCI_2014_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The National Medical Emergency Institute (INEM) is the main emergency medical serviced and can be activated by calling 112.

===Romania===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Romania}}

According to Article 34 of the [[Constitution of Romania]], the state is obliged "to guarantee the protection of healthcare". Romania has a fully universal health care system, which covers up medical check-ups, any surgical interventions, and any post-operator medical care, as well as free or subsidized medicine for a range of diseases. The state is also obliged to fund public hospitals and clinics. Dental care is not funded by the state, although there are public dental clinics in some hospitals, which treat patients free of charge. 
However, due to inadequate funding and corruption, it is estimated that a third of medical expenses are, in some cases, supported by the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romanialibera.ro/stil-de-viata/sanatate/spagile-in-spitale-afla-cat-se-da-pentru-o-operatie-pe-inima-sau-pentru-o-cezariana-215522.html|title=Bribes in hospitals: "tariff" for a surgery or a C-cut}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=January 2015}} Furthermore, Romania spends, per capita, less than any other EU state on medical care.

===Russia and Soviet Union===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Russia}}

In the Soviet Union, the preferred term was "socialist medicine"; the Russian language has no term to distinguish between "socialist" and "socialized" (other than "public", Rus: ''obshchestvenniy/общественный'', sometimes "collectivized" or "nationalized", Rus: ''obobshchestvlenniy/обобществленный'').&lt;ref&gt;Zhuraleva ''et al.'', [http://www.cmj.hr/1999/40/1/9933892.htm Teaching History of Medicine in Russia].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lingvo.yandex.ru/en?text=обобществленный&amp;lang=en&amp;search_type=lingvo&amp;st_translate=1 Yandex Lingvo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia in Soviet times (between 1917 and the early 1990s) had a totally socialist model of health care with a centralised, integrated, hierarchically organised with the government providing free health care to all citizens. Initially successful at combating infectious diseases, the effectiveness of the socialized model declined with underinvestment. Despite a doubling in the number of hospital beds and doctors per capita between 1950 and 1980, the quality of care began to decline by the early 1980s and medical care and health outcomes were below western standards.

The new [[mixed economy]] Russia has switched to a mixed model of health care with private financing and provision running alongside state financing and provision. The OECD reported that unfortunately, none of this has worked out as planned and the reforms have in many respects made the system worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pcsi.pa.go.kr/files/JT03220416.pdf|title=Search Official Documents - OECD|publisher=|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population's health has deteriorated on virtually every measure. The resulting system is overly complex and very inefficient. It has little in common with the model envisaged by the reformers. Although there are more than 300 private insurers and numerous public ones in the market, real competition for patients is rare leaving most patients with little or no effective choice of insurer, and in many places, no choice of health care provider either. The insurance companies have failed to develop as active, informed purchasers of health care services. Most are passive intermediaries, making money by simply channelling funds from regional OMS funds to healthcare providers.

Russian Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] announced a new large-scale health care reform in 2011 and pledged to allocate more than 300 billion rubles ($10 billion) in the next few years to improve health care in the country.&lt;ref name="putin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20100420/158669620.html|title=Putin says Russia needs major health care reform}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that obligatory medical insurance tax paid by companies will increase from current 3.1% to 5.1% starting from 2011.&lt;ref name="putin" /&gt;

===Serbia===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Serbia}}

The Constitution of the Republic of Serbia states that it is a right of every citizen to seek medical assistance free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlament.rs/content/lat/akta/ustav/ustav_1.asp|title=Ustav Republike Srbije (The Constitution of the Republic of Serbia)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved by mutual contribution to the Compulsory Social Healthcare Fund of RZZO (Republički Zavod za Zdravstveno Osiguranje or National Health Insurance Institution). The amount of contribution depends on the amount of money the person is making. During the 1990s, Serbia's healthcare system has been of a poor quality due to severe underfunding. In the recent years, however, that has changed and the Serbian government has invested heavily in new medical infrastructure, completely remodeling existing hospitals and building two new hospitals in [[Novi Sad]] and [[Kragujevac]].

===Spain===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Spain}}

Spain enjoys a public [[universal health care]] system for all citizens and, under certain conditions, also non-citizens. The system is essentially free except for small, often symbolic co-payments in some products and services; it is mostly paid from the [[Social security in Spain|Social Security]] budget. All services are provided in the extensive and readily available network of public and chartered facilities, so private care bills will not be paid. Adult dental care is not covered but for basic extractions or problems that could result in serious [[Oral medicine|stomatological]] conditions.

Irrespective of the nationality and insurance situation of the patient, the public system always treats medical emergencies until achieving the best possible outcome. If not covered by the Spanish Social Security (i.e., a visiting foreigner), the provider later negotiates payment with the patient or the patient's insurer. If actually unable to pay, it is covered by the Social Security on humanitarian grounds unless the patient purposely traveled to Spain to get free healthcare. Obvious unexpected emergencies like accidental injuries or sudden illness are customarily covered, but those that could be reasonably expected (e.g., arising from a chronic condition or from avoidable risk-taking) are studied on a case-per-case basis.

Private health insurance is available for those who prefer it, and recommended for visitors not covered by the Spanish Social Security or a foreign public or private insurer with overseas coverage.

===Sweden===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Sweden}}

Sweden has a universal public health system paid largely from taxation in the same way as other Scandinavian countries. Sweden's entire population has equal access to health care services. The Swedish public health system is funded through taxes levied by the [[County Councils of Sweden|county councils]], but partly run by private companies. Government-paid dental care for those under 21 years old is included in the system. Dental care above a fixed amount is also subsidised.

Sweden also has a smaller private health care sector, mainly in larger cities or as centers for preventive health care financed by employers.

Sweden regularly comes in top in worldwide healthcare rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4460098.stm|title=How the NHS could learn from Sweden| publisher = [[BBC News]] |date= November 28, 2005 |accessdate=September 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Switzerland}}

Healthcare in Switzerland is universal and is regulated by the Federal Health Insurance Act of 1994. Basic health insurance is mandatory for all persons residing in Switzerland (within three months of taking up residence or being born in the country). Insurers are required to offer insurance to everyone, regardless of age or medical condition. They are not allowed to make a profit off this basic insurance, but can on supplemental plans.&lt;ref name="NYtimes"&gt;{{cite news |author=Schwartz, Nelson D. |date=October 1, 2009 |title=Swiss health care thrives without public option|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=A1 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/01/health/policy/01swiss.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Healthcare in the United Kingdom}}

Each of the [[Countries of the United Kingdom]] has a [[National Health Service]] that provides public healthcare to all UK permanent residents that was originally designed to be free at the point of need and paid for from general taxation; but changes included introducing charging for prescription medicines and dentistry (those below 16 and those on certain benefits may still get free treatment). However, since Health is now a [[devolution|devolved matter]], considerable differences are developing between the systems in each of the countries as for example Scotland and Wales abolished prescription charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7149423.stm NHS now four different systems] [[BBC]] January 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Private healthcare companies are free to operate alongside the public one.

====England====
{{Main article|Healthcare in England}}

[[File:NorfolkAndNorwichUniversityHospital(KatyAppleton)Aug2005.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital]], a [[National Health Service]] hospital.]]
The [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS), created by the [[National Health Service Act 1946]], has provided the majority of healthcare in England since its launch on 5 July 1948.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The [[NHS Constitution for England]] documents, at high level, the objectives of the NHS, the legal rights and responsibilities of the various parties (patients, staff, NHS trust boards), and the guiding principles that govern the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_093419 |title=NHS Constitution for England |publisher=Dh.gov.uk |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NHS constitution makes it clear that it provides a comprehensive service, available to all irrespective of age, gender, disability, race, sexual orientation, religion, or belief; that access to NHS services is based on clinical need and not an individual's ability to pay; and that care is never refused on unreasonable grounds. Patient choice in terms of doctor, care, treatments, and place of treatment is an important aspect of the NHS's ambition, and in some cases patients can elect for treatment in other European countries at the NHS's expense. Waiting times are low, with most people able to see their primary care doctor on the same day or the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Commonwealth Fund 2004 International Health Policy Survey of Primary Care in Five Countries|authors=Cathy Schoen and Robin Osborn|year=2004|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/usr_doc/ihp_2004_survey_charts.pdf?section=4039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 36.1% of hospital admissions are from a waiting list, with the remainder being either emergencies admitted immediately or else pre-booked admissions or the like (e.g., child birth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hesonline.nhs.uk/Ease/servlet/AttachmentRetriever?site_id=1937&amp;file_name=d:%5Cefmfiles%5C1937%5CAccessing%5CDataTables%5CHeadline%5CHeadline_0708.pdf&amp;short_name=Headline_0708.pdf&amp;u_id=8220|title=Hospital Episode Statistics|first=NHS Digital, 1 Trevelyan Square, Boar Lane, Leeds, LS1 6AE, United|last=Kingdom|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main goals of care management is to ensure that patients do not experience a delay of more than 18 weeks from initial hospital referral to final treatment, inclusive of time for all associated investigative tests and consultations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.18weeks.nhs.uk/Content.aspx?path=/What-is-18-weeks/About-the-programme|title=18 weeks patient pathway&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, two-thirds of patients are treated in under 12 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.18weeks.nhs.uk/Asset.ashx?path=/RTT/October%202008%20statistical%20press%20notice.pdf|title=18 weeks patient pathway&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though centrally funded, the NHS is not managed by a large central bureaucracy. Responsibility is divided among geographical areas through [[NHS strategic health authority|Strategic Health Authorities]]. Management is distributed even more locally through [[NHS primary care trust]]s, [[NHS hospital trust]]s—and increasingly to [[NHS foundation trust]]s that providing even more decentralized services within the NHS framework, with more decisions left to local people, patients, and staff. The central government office—the Department of Health—is not involved in day-to-day decision making in either the Strategic Health Authorities or the individual local trusts (primarily health, hospital, or ambulance) or the national specialist trusts such as [[NHS Blood and Transplant]]. It does lay down general guidelines they must follow. Local trusts are accountable to their local populations, whilst government ministers are accountable to Parliament for the service overall.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The NHS provides, among other things, [[primary care]], [[hospital|in-patient care]], [[health care|long-term healthcare]], [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] care and treatments, [[ophthalmology]], and [[dentistry]]. All treatment is free with the exception of certain charges for prescriptions, dentistry and ophthalmology (which themselves are free to children, certain students in full-time education, the elderly, the unemployed and those on low incomes). Around 89 pc of NHS prescriptions are obtained free of charge, mostly for children, pensioners, and pregnant women.  Others pay a flat rate of £8.80, and others may cap their annual charges by purchasing an NHS Prescription Prepayment Certificate. Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance. Private insurance accounts for only 4 percent of health expenditure and covers little more than a tenth of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Smee | first = Clive | title = Department of Health Special Section: Reconsidering the Role of Competition in Health Care Markets | journal = Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 945–951 |date = October 2000| url = http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_health_politics_policy_and_law/v025/25.5smee.html | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;

They do not cover generalist consultations, pre-existing conditions, medical emergencies, organ transplants, chronic conditions such as diabetes, or conditions such as pregnancy or HIV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abi.org.uk/Information/Consumers/Health_and_Protection/496.pdf Are you buying private medical insurance?] Association of British Insurers&lt;/ref&gt;

Most NHS general practitioners are private doctors who contract to provide NHS services, but most hospitals are publicly owned and run through [[NHS Trust]]s. A few NHS medical services (such as [[independent Sector Treatment Centre|"surgicentres"]]) are sub-contracted to private providers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = N. generation surgery-centers to carry out thousands more NHS operations every year | publisher = [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] | date=3 December 2002 | url = http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/PressReleases/PressReleasesNotices/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4026000&amp;chk=0NNhMe | accessdate = 2006-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are some non-medical services (such as catering). Some capital projects such as new hospitals have been funded through the [[Private Finance Initiative]], enabling investment without (in the short term) increasing the [[public sector borrowing requirement]], because long-term contractually obligated PFI spending commitments are not counted as government liabilities.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In 1984, the [[Canada Health Act]] was passed, which prohibited extra billing by doctors on patients while at the same time billing the public insurance system.

Retrieved December 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The system is for the most part publicly funded, yet most of the services are provided by private enterprises or private corporations, although most hospitals are public.

The Canada Health Act of 1984 "does not directly bar private delivery or private insurance for publicly insured services," but provides financial disincentives for doing so. "Although there are laws prohibiting or curtailing private health care in some provinces, they can be changed," according to a report in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Clifford |last=Kraus |title=As Canada's Slow-Motion Public Health System Falters, Private Medical Care Is Surging |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/international/americas/26canada.html?ex=1184644800&amp;en=44cca772dc339429&amp;ei=5070 |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= February 26, 2006 |accessdate= July 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Steinbrook, R. |title=Private health care in Canada |journal= [[New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=354 |issue=16 |pages=1661–4 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16625005 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp068064 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/16/1661}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legality of the ban was considered in a decision of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], which ruled in ''[[Chaoulli v. Quebec]]'' that "the prohibition on obtaining private health insurance, while it might be constitutional in circumstances where health care services are reasonable as to both quality and timeliness, is not constitutional where the public system fails to deliver reasonable services." The [[appellant]] contended that waiting times in Quebec violated a right to life and security in the [[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]]. The Court agreed, but acknowledged the importance and validity of the Canada Health Act, and at least four of the seven judges explicitly recognized the right of governments to enact laws and policies that favour the public over the private system and preserve the integrity of the public system.

===Costa Rica===
Universal healthcare and pensions are run by the Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social (CCSS). In 1941, Costa Rica established Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social (CCSS), a social security insurance system for wage-earning workers. In 1961, coverage was expanded to include workers’ dependents and from 1961 to 1975, a series of expansions extended coverage for primary care and outpatient and inpatient specialized services to people in rural areas, the low-income population, and certain vulnerable populations. Further expansions during the late 1970s extended insurance coverage to farmers, peasants, and independent contract workers. Additionally, CCSS mandates free health service provision to mothers, children, indigenous people, the elderly, and people living with disabilities, regardless of insurance coverage. By 2000, 82 percent of the population was eligible for CCSS, which has continued to expand in the ensuing period. By covering all population groups through the same system, Costa Rica has avoided social insurance stratification and inequity common in many other countries in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/978-0-8213-6278-5|title=Health System Innovations in Central America|date=July 1, 2005|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=November 30, 2016|via=elibrary.worldbank.org (Atypon)|doi=10.1596/978-0-8213-6278-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CCSS is funded by a 15 percent payroll tax, as well as payments from retiree pensions [6]. Taxes on luxury goods, alcohol, soda, and imported products also help to cover poor households who do otherwise pay into the system. All CCSS funds are merged into a single pool, which is managed by the central financial administration of CCSS. In 1973, the Ministry of Health decided to move away from direct service provision and adopt a steering role. Responsibility for the provision of most care was transferred to the CCSS, although the Ministry retained responsibility for disease control, food and drug regulation, environmental sanitation, child nutrition, and primary care for the poor.  Through the CCSS, health care is now essentially free to nearly all Costa Ricans. Private health care is also widely available and INS offers private health insurance plans to supplement CCSS insurance.&lt;ref&gt;Toward Universal Health Coverage and Equity in Latin America and the Caribbean https://dx.doi.org/10.1596/978-1-4648-0454-0&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuba===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Cuba}}

The Cuban government operates a national health system and assumes fiscal and administrative responsibility for the health care of all its citizens. There are no private hospitals or clinics as all health services are government-run. The present Minister for Public Health is [[Roberto Morales Ojeda]]. However, although the coverage is wide, the system is underfunded and recently also understaffed. The government organized medical missions in other countries has taken a very significant number of doctors and other personal. In 2005 there were 25,000 Cuban doctors in Venezuela.

===Mexico===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Mexico}}

Public health care delivery is accomplished via an elaborate provisioning and delivery system instituted by the Mexican Federal Government. Public health care is provided to all Mexican citizens as guaranteed via Article 4 of the Constitution. Public care is either fully or partially subsidized by the federal government, depending on the person's (Spanish: derechohabiente's) employment status. All Mexican citizens are eligible for subsidized health care regardless of their work status via a system of health care facilities operating under the federal Secretariat of Health (formerly the Secretaria de Salubridad y Asistencia, or SSA) agency.
Employed citizens and their dependents, however, are further eligible to use the health care program administered and operated by the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) (English: Mexican Social Security Institute). The IMSS health care program is a tripartite system funded equally by the employee, its private employer, and the federal government. The IMSS does not provide service to employees of the public sector. Employees in the public sector are serviced by the Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado (ISSSTE) (English: Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers), which attends to the health and social care needs of government employees. This includes local, state, and federal government employees. The government of the states in Mexico also provide health services independently of those services provided by the federal government programs. In most states, the state government has established free or subsidized healthcare to all their citizens.

In 2006, the Mexican government created the Health Insurance for a New Generation also known as "life insurance for babies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/en/press/?contenido=31601 Message to the Nation from the President of Mexico, Felipe Calderón Hinojosa, on the occasion of his first State of the Union Address] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208074049/http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/en/press/?contenido=31601 |date=December 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/en/press/?contenido=31365 President Calderón during First National Week of Affiliation to Medical Insurance for a New Generation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110000632/http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/en/press/?contenido=31365 |date=January 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/en/press/?contenido=34031 President Calderón at Launching of Affiliation to Medical Insurance for a New Generation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622095216/http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/en/press/?contenido=34031 |date=June 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 28, 2009, Universal Care Coverage for Pregnant Women was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/en/press/?contenido=45307 International Women's Day] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622103804/http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/en/press/?contenido=45307 |date=June 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A universal health care system is used in Trinidad and Tobago and is the primary form of health-care available in the country. It is used by the majority of the population seeking medical assistance, as it is free for all citizens.

===United States===

{{Health care reform in the United States}}Since the enactment of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] in 2010, health insurance coverage has been increasing with the goal of eventually reaching near 100% coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2017/demo/p60-260.pdf|title=Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2016|last=|first=|date=September 2017|website=United States Census Bureau|access-date=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States as a whole does not have a fully implemented universal health care system, but about 92% of its citizens have health insurance coverage as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2017/comm/well-being.html|title=Measuring the Nation’s Social and Economic Well-Being|last=Bureau|first=US Census|website=www.census.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Massachusetts]] became the [[Massachusetts health care reform|first state to mandate universal health insurance in 2006]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Fahrenthold, David A. |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/04/AR2006040401937.html |title= Mass.

The law prohibits insurers from capping their liability for a person's health care needs, a move expected to rectify [[medical debt|medically induced bankruptcy]]. As of October 7, 2016, the U.S. uninsured rate fell to 10.9% from the 14.6% recorded when President Obama came into office. During the debates about proposed Obamacare, more and more Americans dropped their existing insurance in hopes of something better from Obama's plan, and the uninsured rate peaked at 17.1% just before Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, started its "exchanges" and made the new plans available. 85.4% of Americans had insurance when Obama entered office; 89.1% had insurance by the time he left office.&lt;ref name="gallup.com"/&gt;

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] and related government agencies scored the cost of a universal health care system several times since 1991, and have uniformly predicted cost savings,&lt;ref&gt;Physicians for a National Health Program (January, 2008) [http://www.pnhp.org/facts/single_payer_system_cost.php?page=all "Single Payer System Cost?"] ''pnhp.org''&lt;/ref&gt; partly from the elimination of insurance company overhead costs.&lt;ref name="ingentaconnect813"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Levy A.R. | year = 2010 | title = International comparison of comparative effectiveness research in five jurisdictions: insights for the US | url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/adis/pec/2010/00000028/00000010/art00004 | journal = PharmacoEconomics | volume = 28 | issue = 10| pages = 813–30 | pmid = 20831289 | doi = 10.2165/11536150-000000000-00000 |name-list-format=vanc | display-authors = 1 | last2 = Mitton | first2 = Craig | last3 = Johnston | first3 = Karissa M. | last4 = Harrigan | first4 = Brian | last5 = Briggs | first5 = Andrew H. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a universal health care proposal was pending in Congress, the [[United States National Health Care Act]] (H.R. 676, formerly the "Medicare for All Act").

The [[Congressional Budget Office|Congressional Budget Office (CBO)]] estimated that the bill would reduce the number of nonelderly people who are uninsured by about 32 million, leaving about 23 million nonelderly residents uninsured (about one-third of whom would be illegal immigrants). Under the legislation, the share of legal nonelderly residents with insurance coverage would rise from about 83 percent in 2010 to about 94 percent by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=546 |title=Cost Estimate for Pending Health Care Legislation |publisher=CBO Director's Blog |accessdate=March 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325191945/http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=546 |archivedate=March 25, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the state of Vermont became the first state to pass legislation [[Vermont health care reform|establishing a single-payer health care system]]. The legislation, known as [http://www.leg.state.vt.us/docs/2012/Acts/ACT048.pdf Act 48], establishes health care in the state as a "human right" and lays the responsibility on the state to provide a health care system that meets the needs of the citizens of Vermont. The proposal was shelved not long after the main provisions of the law took effect in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/single-payer-vermont-113711|title=Why single payer died in Vermont|publisher=|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revised estimate in July 2012 by the CBO stated 30 million people would gain access to health insurance under the law.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43471-hr6079.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussion in the United States commonly uses the term [[socialized medicine]] to impart a [[pejorative]] meaning to the idea of universal health care.

== South America ==
[[Health care in Argentina|Argentina]], [[Health care in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Health in Chile|Chile]], [[Health care in Colombia|Colombia]], [[Healthcare in Peru|Peru]], [[Health in Uruguay|Uruguay]], and [[Health care in Venezuela|Venezuela]] all have public universal health care provided.

===Argentina===
{{Main article|Health care in Argentina}}

Health care is provided through a combination of employer and labor union-sponsored plans (Obras Sociales), government insurance plans, public hospitals and clinics and through private health insurance plans. It costs almost 10% of GDP and is available to anyone regardless of ideology, beliefs, race or nationality.

===Brazil===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Brazil}}

The universal health care system was adopted in Brazil in 1988 after the end of the military regime's rule. However, universalized/socialized health care was available many years before, in some cities, once the 27th amendment to the 1969 Constitution imposed the duty of applying 6% of their income in healthcare on the municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/constituicao/Emendas/Emc_anterior1988/emc01-69.htm |title=Emc1 |publisher=Planalto.gov.br |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
{{Main article|Healthcare in Chile}}

Health care in Chile is provided by the government (via Fonasa) and by private insurers (via Isapre). All workers and pensioners are mandated to pay 7% of their income for health care insurance (the poorest pensioners are exempt from this payment). Workers who choose not to join an Isapre, are automatically covered by Fonasa. Fonasa also covers unemployed people receiving unemployment benefits, uninsured pregnant women, insured worker's dependant family, people with mental or physical disabilities and people who are considered poor or indigent.

Fonasa costs vary depending on income, disability or age. Attention at public health facilities via Fonasa is free for low-income earners, people with mental or physical disabilities and people over the age of 60. Others pay 10% or 20% of the costs, depending on income and number of dependants. Fonasa beneficiaries may also seek attention in the private sector, for a designated fee.

Additionally, there are a number of high-mortality illnesses (currently 69) that have special attention guarantees for both Isapre and Fonasa affiliates, in relation to access to treatment, waiting times, maximum costs and quality of service.

===Colombia===

In 1993 a reform transformed the health care system in Colombia, trying to provide a better, sustainable, health care system and to reach every Colombian citizen.

===Peru===
{{main article|Healthcare in Peru}}

On April 10, 2009, the Government of Peru published the Law on Health Insurance to enable all Peruvians to access quality health services, and contribute to regulate the financing and supervision of these services. The law enables all population to access diverse health services to prevent illnesses, and promote and rehabilitate people, under a Health Basic Plan (PEAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andina.com.pe/Ingles/Noticia.aspx?id=mSOVQJu0hxY= |title=Law on Health Insurance published today |publisher=Andina.com.pe |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andina.com.pe/Ingles/Noticia.aspx?id=rsbFfAZYpMU= |title=President Garcia: Law on Health Insurance marks major reform |publisher=Andina.com.pe |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2, 2010, President Alan Garcia Perez on Friday signed a supreme ordinance approving the regulations for the framework law on the Universal Health Insurance, which seeks to provide access to quality health care for all Peruvian citizens.

Peru's Universal Health Insurance law aims to increase access to timely and quality health care services, emphasizes maternal and child health promotion, and provides the poor with protection from financial ruin due to illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aus-peru.blogspot.com/ |title=Aseguramiento Universal de Salud – Perú |publisher=Aus-peru.blogspot.com |date=February 24, 2004 |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulation states that membership of the Universal Health Insurance (AUS for its Spanish acronym) is compulsory for the entire population living in the country. To that end, the Ministry of Health will approve, by supreme ordinance, the mechanisms leading to compulsory membership, as well as escalation and implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andina.com.pe/Ingles/Noticia.aspx?Id=GWzJKZKIRnY= |title=President Garcia signs regulations for Universal Health Insurance law |publisher=Andina.com.pe |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oceania==
[[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] have universal health care.

===Australia===
{{Main article|Medicare (Australia)|Health care in Australia}}
[[File:Medicare brand.svg|thumb|250px|[[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] logo]]

In Australia, Medibank&amp;nbsp;— as it was then known&amp;nbsp;— was introduced, by the [[Whitlam Labor government]] on July 1, 1975, through the [[Health Insurance Act 1973]]. The [[Australian Senate]] rejected the changes multiple times and they were passed only after a joint sitting after the [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974 double dissolution election]]. However, Medibank was supported by the subsequent [[Malcolm Fraser|Fraser]] [[Coalition (Australia)]] government and became a key feature of Australia's public policy landscape. The exact structure of Medibank/Medicare, in terms of the size of the rebate to doctors and hospitals and the way it has administered, has varied over the years. The original Medibank program proposed a 1.35% levy (with low income exemptions) but these bills were rejected by the Senate, and so Medibank was funded from general taxation. In 1976, the Fraser Government introduced a 2.5% levy and split Medibank in two: a universal scheme called Medibank Public and a government-owned private health insurance company, [[Medibank Private]].

During the 1980s, Medibank Public was renamed Medicare by the [[Hawke Labor government]], which also changed the funding model, to an income tax surcharge, known as the [[Medicare (Australia)#Program funding|Medicare Levy]], which was set at 1.5%, with exemptions for low income earners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/content.asp?doc=/content/17482.htm&amp;pc=001/002/030/003/001&amp;mnu=&amp;mfp=&amp;st=&amp;cy=1 |title=What is the Medicare levy? |accessdate=February 15, 2008 |author=Australian Taxation Office |date=June 19, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022051913/http://ato.gov.au/individuals/content.asp?doc=%2Fcontent%2F17482.htm&amp;pc=001%2F002%2F030%2F003%2F001&amp;mnu=&amp;mfp=&amp;st=&amp;cy=1 |archivedate=October 22, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[John Howard|Howard]] Coalition government introduced an additional levy of 1.0%, known as the Medicare Levy Surcharge, for those on high annual incomes ($70,000) and do not have adequate levels of private hospital coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/content.asp?doc=/content/7128.htm&amp;page=4&amp;H4 |title=Medicare Levy Surcharge |publisher=Ato.gov.au |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of an effort by the Coalition to encourage take-up of private health insurance. According to WHO, government funding covered 67.5% of Australia's health care expenditures in 2004; private sources covered the remaining 32.5% of expenditures.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS"/&gt;

===New Zealand===
{{Main article|Health care in New Zealand}}

As with Australia, New Zealand's healthcare system is funded through general taxation. According to the WHO, government sources covered 77.4% of New Zealand's health care costs in 2004; private expenditures covered the remaining 22.6%.&lt;ref name="WHOSIS"/&gt;

==Early life and education==

Gajewski has a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Economics and Statistics from [[Rutgers University]].

== Career ==
After being diagnosed, in 2010, with the rare condition, [[Mixed connective tissue disease|Mixed connective tissue disease (MTCD)]], Gajewski told by her physician to keep track of her symptoms between medical appointments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/generalprofessionalissues/50553|title=Transparency Summit: Patients vs. Doctors|last=Firth|first=Shannon|date=2015-03-18|work=MedPage Today|access-date=2017-12-29|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This motivated her to improve health prospects for patients.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medicinex.stanford.edu/conf/conference/user/1045|title=Natasha Gajewski|last=|first=|date=|website=Medicinex - Stanford University|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prescribedesign.com/hacking-my-patient-experience/|title=D-Patient Series: Hacking My Patient Experience – Prescribe Design|last=|first=|date=|website=Prescribe Design|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://homecaretechreport.com/article.asp?id=1643|title=New Tools Help Patients Self-Manage Health, Chronic Conditions|last=Kinsella|first=Audrey|date=|website=Home Care Tech Report|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the idea to create a mobile symptom journal.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Gajewski was initially faced with the prohibitive costs of developing a [[Mobile app]] after approaching developers from the [[United States]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://njtechweekly.com/art/1372-growing-princeton-tech-meetup-features-networking-speakers/|title=Growing Princeton Tech Meetup Features Networking, Speakers|last=Surden|first=Esther|date=2012-05-30|website=New Jersey Tech Weekly|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; To evaluate the feasibility and validity of the app, she attend [[Eric Ries]]'s 2011 [[Lean startup]] - [[San Francisco]] where her idea was the 2nd-place winner and was voted "most fundable" and "most likely to succeed."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gust.com/companies/symple_health|title=Symple Health|website=Gust|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a February 2017 [https://myheartsisters.org/ Heart Sisters] interview, Gajewksi said of her experience designing a mobile app:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://myheartsisters.org/2017/02/12/clueless/|title=If you’re clueless and you know it . . .|last=Thomas|first=Carolyn|date=2017-02-12|work=Heart Sisters|access-date=2017-10-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|But there wasn’t [already a mobile app], so I went about making my own. Because I was actively sick at the time, I knew certain things that a healthy person might completely miss – something as simple as not using sliders on a screen because they’re harder to activate (and require more thought) than a button.

'''Nun's Well''' is an ancient underground water [[reservoir]] in the [[British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]]. It is located at [[Europa Point]], and is thought to be of the [[Moors|Moorish]] period. It represents some of the earliest evidence of an artificial [[Water supply and sanitation in Gibraltar|water supply in Gibraltar]]. The name of the [[cistern]] is thought to be derived from the [[nuns]] associated with the [[Shrine of Our Lady of Europe]]. In the eighteenth century, Nun's Well supplied the military with water. In the early nineteenth century, it provided water for the [[brewery]] that was built next door. In 1988, the [[Royal Engineers]] constructed what is now the main building, which has a castle-like appearance. Nun's Well became the focus of controversy during the 2010-2011 restoration of the site.

==Nineteenth century==

[[File:Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn by Sir William Beechey.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]]]]
[[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn|Prince Edward, the Duke of Kent]] (2 November 1767 &amp;ndash; 23 January 1820), later the father of [[Queen Victoria]], arrived in Gibraltar for the second time in May 1802. His first arrival had been in 1790 as an officer; his second stay at Gibraltar was as Governor, following the death of Governor General [[Charles O'Hara]]. Prince Edward was ordered by his brother [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Prince Frederick, Duke of York]] to restore discipline at the garrison, as the soldiers spent much of their time inebriated. Before the prince's arrival, Gibraltar had ninety-two taverns which served its approximately 7,000 civilians and soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nelson's Refuge: Gibraltar in the Age of Napoleon|publisher=[[Naval Institute Press]]|isbn= 9781612510842|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HThZ_inxa14C&amp;pg=PT68&amp;lpg=PT68&amp;dq=Prince+Edward's+Gate,+Gibraltar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pAIlKj0tv1&amp;sig=_01B066EBz8gq66WYXurfTODTi0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=h5BmUKOqB-a_ygG824CIBw&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwATge#v=onepage&amp;q=Prince%20Edward's%20Gate%2C%20Gibraltar&amp;f=false|author=Musteen, Jason R.|accessdate=8 October 2012|date=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=canadian&gt;{{cite DCB |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/edward_augustus_5E.html |title=Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn |volume=5 |last=MacNutt |first=W.S. |accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his arrival, he closed down the majority of the wine houses that had been frequented by the soldiers.

In the early twentieth century, the military barracks next to the Nun's Well site, referred to as Brewery Barracks, was reported to be in an "insanitary" condition. Discussions at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] further indicated that large amounts of money had already been spent on the barracks, and that they were scheduled to be replaced.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name=costa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The parliamentary debates|year=1904|publisher=[[Reuters|Reuter's Telegram Co]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vr7ARemKpjkC&amp;pg=PR936&amp;lpg=PR936&amp;dq=Brewery+barracks,+Gibraltar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8B7wrYH7gJ&amp;sig=t7Axqu81v0jz-ie-NiWBJzsIAsk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-khzUIK9N4bkyQHKs4DoBQ&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Brewery%20barracks%2C%20Gibraltar&amp;f=false|author=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=8 October 2012|pages=1487–1488}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 1987, the Royal Engineers conducted an investigation of the Nun's Well site. The following year, the Royal Engineers constructed what is now the main building. It has a castle-like appearance; its addition was part of a general restoration of the site. The site of the previous brewery and later barracks is now open ground which is utilised by the military for target practice.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref name=costa/&gt; While the reservoir had been thought to fill with water that drains along the fractures of the nearby Beefsteak Fault, recent investigation has led researchers to believe that it fills with a combination of rain, street flushing, and sea spray, particularly during [[Levant (wind)|levanter]] winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Geology - Ground and Surface Water Supply|url=http://vox.gi/science/geology/3305-Ground_Surface_Water_Supply20012008.html|accessdate=7 October 2012|newspaper=Vox - The Truly Independent Gibraltar Newspaper|date=20 January 2008|author=Gomez, Freddie|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808030107/http://vox.gi/science/geology/3305-Ground_Surface_Water_Supply20012008.html|archivedate=8 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010, the [[Government of Gibraltar]] requested that the [[Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society]] (GONHS) make suggestions for the landscaping of Europa Point, as the government was intent on restoring the site. A report was completed and contractors transplanted vegetation to the area by Nun's Well to be tended while awaiting replanting. However, irrigation was not provided for the landscaping plants, with the result that most of the plants at Nun's Well died. Another thousand plants that replaced them were also neglected and largely died. Concurrently, an adjacent area which was covered with the strictly protected [[Gibraltar Sea Lavender]] ''(Limonium emarginatum)'' had [[rubble]] dumped upon it.&lt;ref name=gonhs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plant Life - Sea cliffs and shoreline|url=http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi/flora-and-fauna/plant-life|work=gibraltar.gov.gi|publisher=[[Government of Gibraltar]]|accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The errors were compounded when replacement planting took place in the heat of summer, and dumping of rubble on the lavender continued. The society contended that the events which transpired were against both the government's own Environment Charter and Environmental Action and Management Plan.&lt;ref name=gonhs&gt;{{cite news|title=GONHS Concerns About Europa Point Landscaping|url=http://vox.gi/local/4121-gonhs-concerns-about-europa-point-landscaping.html|accessdate=7 October 2012|newspaper=Vox - The Truly Independent Gibraltar Newspaper|date=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, the council of the Gibraltar Ornithological and Natural History Society declined an invitation for its [[General Secretary]] [[John Cortes]] to attend the inauguration of the recently restored Europa Point. The reasons cited included the [[Habitat destruction|destruction]] of the [[habitat]], the flouting of laws relating to the removal of Gibraltar's [[protected species]], and the ignoring of solicited advice on landscaping with salt-resistant [[native plants]]. The decision was criticised by [[Chief Minister of Gibraltar|Chief Minister]] [[Peter Caruana]] as a "political stunt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gibraltar Ornithological &amp; Natural History Society|url=http://www.gonhs.org/press.htm|work=gonhs.org|publisher=The [[Gibraltar Ornithological &amp; Natural History Society]]|accessdate=7 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cortes Boycott of Europa Inauguration 'a Political Stunt', says Caruana|url=http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=23057|accessdate=7 October 2012|newspaper=[[Gibraltar Chronicle]]|date=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caruana's statements were denounced by the GONHS as a "vitriolic attack" and a spokesman indicated that their society was an "apolitical ... independent NGO" ([[non-governmental organization]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Decision to Boycott Europa Opening Was Taken Unanimously|url=http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=23067|accessdate=7 October 2012|newspaper=Gibraltar Chronicle|date=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31905">[[File:Cebocap.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Prescription placebos used in research and practice.]]
'''Placebo-controlled studies''' are a way of testing a medical therapy in which, in addition to a group of subjects that receives the treatment to be evaluated, a separate [[Scientific control|control]] group receives a sham "[[placebo]]" treatment which is specifically designed to have no real effect. Placebos are most commonly used in [[Blind experiment|blinded]] trials, where subjects do not know whether they are receiving real or placebo treatment. Often, there is also a further "natural history" group that does not receive any treatment at all.

The purpose of the placebo group is to account for the [[placebo effect]], that is, effects from treatment that do not depend on the treatment itself. Such factors include knowing one is receiving a treatment, attention from health care professionals, and the expectations of a treatment's effectiveness by those running the research study. Without a placebo group to compare against, it is not possible to know whether the treatment itself had any effect.

Patients frequently show improvement even when given a sham or "fake" treatment. Such intentionally inert [[placebo]] treatments can take many forms, such as a pill containing only sugar, a surgery where nothing efficacious is actually done (just an incision and sometimes some minor touching or handling of the underlying structures), or a medical device (such as an [[medical ultrasonography|ultrasound machine]]) that is not actually turned on. Also, due to the body's natural healing ability and statistical effects such as [[regression to the mean]], many patients will get better even when given no treatment at all. Thus, the relevant question when assessing a treatment is not "does the treatment work?" but "does the treatment work better than a placebo treatment, or no treatment at all?" As one early [[clinical trial]] researcher wrote, "the first object of a therapeutic trial is to discover whether the patients who receive the treatment under investigation are cured more rapidly, more completely or more frequently, than they would have been without it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gaddum JH |title=Clinical pharmacology |journal=Proc. R. Soc. Med. |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=195–204 |date=March 1954 |pmid=13155508 |pmc=1918604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sup|p.195}} More broadly, the aim of a [[clinical trial]] is to determine what treatments, delivered in what circumstances, to which patients, in what conditions, are the most effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chambless DL, Hollon SD |title=Defining empirically supported therapies |journal=J Consult Clin Psychol |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=7–18 |date=February 1998 |pmid=9489259 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/ccp/66/1/7 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.66.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lohr JM, Olatunji BO, Parker L, DeMaio C |title=Experimental analysis of specific treatment factors: efficacy and practice implications |journal=J Clin Psychol |volume=61 |issue=7 |pages=819–34 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15827994 |doi=10.1002/jclp.20128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the use of placebos is a standard [[Scientific control|control]] component of most [[clinical trial]]s, which attempt to make some sort of [[quantitative property|quantitative]] assessment of the efficacy of medicinal drugs or treatments. Such a test or clinical trial is called a ''placebo-controlled'' study, and its control is of the [[scientific control#Negative|negative]] type. A study whose control is a previously tested treatment, rather than no treatment, is called a ''positive-control'' study, because its control is of the [[scientific control#Positive|positive]] type. Government regulatory agencies approve new drugs only after tests establish not only that patients respond to them, but also that their effect is greater than that of a placebo (by way of affecting more patients, by affecting responders more strongly, or both).

== Methodology ==

===Single Blind trials===
Things like sugar pills, that look like real treatments but in fact have no physical effect are used to create "blind" trials in which the participants do not know whether they are getting the active treatment or not, so that physical effects can be measured independently of the participants' expectations. Single Blind trials control all of these by making whatever expectations there are equal for all cases.

Placebos are not the only possible technique for creating "blindness" (= unawareness of the treatment): to test the effectiveness of [[prayer]] by others, the participants are not told who has and has not had prayers said for them. To test the effect of changing the frequency of [[fluorescent light]]s on [[headache]]s, the light fittings are changed at night in the absence of the office workers (this is a real case). It has been shown that "mock" surgery can have similar effects,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} and so some surgical techniques must be studied with placebo controls (rarely double blind, due to the difficulty involved).

=== Double-blind trials===
Because a doctor's belief in the value of a treatment can affect his or her behavior, and thus what his or her patient believes, clinical trials are usually conducted in "[[double-blind]]" manner: that is, not only are the patients made unaware when they are receiving a placebo, the doctors are made unaware too.

Nearly all studies conducted find benefit in the placebo group. For example, Khan published a [[meta-analysis]] of studies of investigational [[antidepressant]]s and found a 30% reduction in suicide and attempted suicide in the placebo groups and a 40% reduction in the treated groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khan A, Warner HA, Brown WA |title=Symptom reduction and suicide risk in patients treated with placebo in antidepressant clinical trials: an analysis of the Food and Drug Administration database |journal=Arch. Gen. Psychiatry |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=311–7 |date=April 2000 |pmid=10768687 |url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10768687 |doi=10.1001/archpsyc.57.4.311 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies generally do not include an untreated group, so determining the actual size of the placebo effect, compared to totally untreated patients, is difficult.

=== Natural history groups===
The practice of using an additional [[natural history group]] as the trial's so-called "''third arm''" has emerged; and trials are conducted using three [[randomized clinical trial|randomly selected]], equally matched trial groups, David&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Creative consulting: what modifies a healing response| journal=Student BMJ| year=2002| first=David| last=Reilly| volume=10| pages=1–44| url=http://student.bmj.com/issues/02/02/education/12.php }} p.28&lt;/ref&gt; wrote: "''... it is necessary to remember the adjective ‘random’ [in the term ‘random sample’] should apply to the method of drawing the sample and not to the sample itself.''".

* The '''Active drug''' group ('''A'''): who receive the active test drug.
* The '''Placebo drug''' group ('''P'''): who receive a placebo drug that simulates the active drug.
* The '''Natural history''' group ('''NH'''): who receive no treatment of any kind (and whose condition, therefore, is allowed to run its ''natural'' course).

The outcomes within each group are observed, and compared with each other, allowing us to measure:
* The efficacy of the active drug's '''treatment''': the difference between '''A''' and '''NH''' (i.e., '''A-NH''').
* The efficacy of the active drug's '''active ingredient''': the difference between '''A''' and '''P''' (i.e., '''A-P''').
* The magnitude of the '''placebo response''': the difference between '''P''' and '''NH''' (i.e., '''P-NH''').
It is a matter of interpretation whether the value of '''P-NH''' indicates the ''efficacy of the entire treatment process'' or the ''magnitude of the "placebo response"''. The results of these comparisons then determine whether or not a particular drug is considered efficacious.

===Indexing===
In certain clinical trials of particular drugs, it may happen that the level of the "placebo responses" manifested by the trial's subjects are either considerably higher or lower (in relation to the "active" drug's effects) than one would expect from other trials of similar drugs. In these cases, [[Ceteris paribus|with all other things being equal]], it is reasonable to conclude that:
* the degree to which there is a '''considerably higher''' level of "placebo response" than one would expect is an index of the degree to which the drug's ''active ingredient'' is '''not efficacious'''.
* the degree to which there is a '''considerably lower''' level of "placebo response" than one would expect is an index of the degree to which, in some particular way, the ''placebo'' is '''not simulating''' the active drug in an appropriate way.

However, in particular cases such as the use of Cimetidine to treat ulcers, a significant level of placebo response can also prove to be an index of how much the treatment has been directed at a wrong target.

==Implementation issues==

===Adherence ===
The Coronary Drug Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM198010303031804 |title=Influence of adherence to treatment and response of cholesterol on mortality in the coronary drug project |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=303 |issue=18 |pages=1038–41 |date=October 1980 |pmid=6999345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was intended to study the safety and effectiveness of drugs for long-term treatment of coronary heart disease in men. Those in the placebo group who adhered to the placebo treatment (took the placebo regularly as instructed) showed nearly half the [[mortality rate]] as those who were not adherent.
A similar study of women similarly found survival was nearly 2.5 times greater for those who adhered to their placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= The relationship of treatment adherence to the risk of death after myocardial infarction in women| journal=Journal of the American Medical Association| year=1993| first=E. J.| last=Gallagher|author2=Viscoli, C. M. |author3=Horwitz, R. I. | volume=270| pages=742–4| doi= 10.1001/jama.270.6.742| pmid=8336377| issue= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This apparent placebo effect may have occurred because:
* Adhering to the protocol had a psychological effect, i.e. genuine placebo effect.
* People who were already healthier were more able or more inclined to follow the protocol.
* Compliant people were more diligent and health-conscious in all aspects of their lives.

===Recognition===
Appropriate use of a placebo in a [[clinical trial]] often requires or at least benefits from a [[double-blind]] study design, which means that neither the experimenters nor the subjects know which subjects are in the "test group" and which are in the "control group". This creates a problem in creating placebos that can be mistaken for active treatments. It therefore can be necessary to use a '''psychoactive placebo''', a drug that produces physiological effects that encourage the belief in the control groups that they have received an active drug.

A psychoactive placebo was used in the [[Marsh Chapel Experiment]], a [[double-blind]] study in which the experimental group received the [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] substance [[psilocybin]] while the control group received a large dose of [[niacin]], a substance that produces noticeable physical effects intended to lead the control subjects to believe they had received the '''psychoactive drug'''. The term "psychoactive placebo" is rare in the literature; but, when it is used, it always denotes a placebo of this type. For example, "''Neither the experienced investigator nor the naive [subject] is easily fooled on the matter of whether he has received a [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] substance or merely a [[psychoactive]] placebo such as [[amphetamine]].''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Harman WW, McKim RH, Mogar RE, Fadiman J, Stolaroff MJ |title=Psychedelic agents in creative problem-solving: a pilot study |journal=Psychol Rep |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=211–27 |date=August 1966 |pmid=5942087 |doi=10.2466/pr0.1966.19.1.211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== James Lind and scurvy===
[[File:James lind.jpg|thumb|left|200px|James Lind|A portrait of Scottish doctor James Lind (1716-1794)]]In 1747, [[James Lind (physician)|James Lind]] (1716–1794), the [[ship's doctor]] on [[HMS Salisbury]], conducted the first [[clinical trial]] when he investigated the efficacy of [[citrus fruit]] in cases of [[scurvy]]. He randomly divided twelve scurvy patients, whose "cases were as similar as I could have them", into six pairs. Each pair was given a different remedy.  According to Lind’s 1753 ''Treatise on the Scurvy in Three Parts Containing an Inquiry into the Nature, Causes, and Cure of the Disease, Together with a Critical and Chronological View of what has been Published of the Subject'', the remedies were: one quart of [[cider]] per day, twenty-five drops of elixir [[vitriol]] ([[sulfuric acid]]) three times a day, two spoonfuls of [[vinegar]] three times a day, a course of sea-water (half a [[pint]] every day), two [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s and one [[lemon]] each day, and [[electuary]], (a mixture containing [[garlic]], [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]], [[balsam of Peru]], and [[myrrh]]).&lt;ref name="Lind"&gt;{{cite journal| title= James Lind (1716-94) of Edinburgh and the treatment of scurvy| journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition| date=  January 1, 1997 | first=Peter M.| last=Dunn| volume=76| pages=F64–5 | pmid= 9059193| issue= 1| doi= 10.1136/fn.76.1.F64| pmc= 1720613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He noted that the pair who had been given the oranges and lemons were so restored to health within six days of treatment that one of them returned to duty, and the other was well enough to attend the rest of the sick.&lt;ref name="Lind"/&gt;{{clear}}

===Animal magnetism===
In 1784, the French [[Royal Commission]] looked into the existence of [[animal magnetism]], comparing the effects of allegedly "magnetized" water with that of plain water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gauld, Alan |title=A history of hypnotism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1992 |isbn=0-521-48329-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Donaldson IM |title=Mesmer's 1780 proposal for a controlled trial to test his method of treatment using "animal magnetism" |journal=J R Soc Med |volume=98 |issue=12 |pages=572–5 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16319443 |pmc=1299353 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.98.12.572 |url=http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16319443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Best M, Neuhauser D, Slavin L |title=Evaluating Mesmerism, Paris, 1784: the controversy over the blinded placebo controlled trials has not stopped |journal=Qual Saf Health Care |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=232–3 |date=June 2003 |pmid=12792017 |pmc=1743715 |url=http://qhc.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12792017 |doi=10.1136/qhc.12.3.232}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It did not examine the practices of [[Franz Mesmer]], but examined the significantly different practices of his associate Charles d'Eslon (1739–1786).

=== Perkins tractors===

=== Flint and placebo active treatment comparison===
In 1863 [[Austin Flint murmur|Austin Flint]] (1812–1886) conducted the first-ever trial that directly compared the efficacy of a dummy simulator with that of an active treatment; although Flint's examination did not compare the two against each other in the same trial. Even so, this was a significant departure from the (then) customary practice of contrasting the consequences of an active treatment with what Flint described as "''the natural history of [an untreated] disease''".&lt;ref name="Finkt"&gt;Flint, A., "A Contribution Toward the Natural History of Articular Rheumatism, Consisting of a Report of Thirteen Cases Treated Solely with Palliative Measures", ''American Journal of the Medical Sciences'', Vol.46, (July 1863), pp.17–36.
[http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/trial_records/19th_Century/flint/flint_tp.html]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|18}}

Flint’s paper is the first time that he terms "placebo" or "placeboic remedy" were used to refer to a dummy simulator in a clinical trial.{{quote|… to secure the moral effect of a remedy given specially for the disease, the patients were placed on the use of a placebo which consisted, in nearly all of the cases, of the tincture of [[quassia]], very largely diluted. This was given regularly, and became well known in my wards as the placeboic remedy for [[rheumatism]].}}

Flint&lt;ref name="Finkt"/&gt;{{Rp|21}} treated 13 hospital inmates who had [[rheumatic fever]]; 11 were "[[Acute (medical)|acute]]", and 2 were "sub-acute". He then compared the results of his dummy "placeboic remedy"  with that of the active treatment’s already well-understood results. (Flint had previously tested, and reported on, the active treatment’s efficacy.) There was no significant difference between the results of the active treatment and his "placeboic remedy" in 12 of the cases in terms of disease duration, duration of convalescence, number of joints affected, and emergence of [[Complication (medicine)|complication]]s.&lt;ref name="Finkt"/&gt;{{Rp|32–34}} In the thirteenth case, Flint expressed some doubt whether the particular complications that had emerged (namely, [[pericarditis]], [[endocarditis]], and [[pneumonia]]) would have been prevented if that subject had been immediately given the "active treatment".&lt;ref name="Finkt"/&gt;{{Rp|36}}

=== Jellinek  and headache remedy ingredients===

Jellinek in 1946&lt;ref name="Jellinke"&gt;Jellinek, E. M. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3001983 JSTORE "Clinical Tests on Comparative Effectiveness of Analgesic Drugs"], ''Biometrics Bulletin'', Vol.2, No.5, (October 1946), pp.87–91.&lt;/ref&gt; was asked to test whether or not the headache drug's overall efficacy would be reduced if certain ingredients were removed. In post-[[World War II]] 1946, pharmaceutical chemicals were restricted, and one U.S. headache remedy manufacturer sold a drug composed of three ingredients: '''a''', '''b''', and '''c''', and chemical '''b''' was in particular short supply.

Jellinek set up a complex trial involving 199 subjects, all of whom suffered from "''frequent headaches''". The subjects were randomly divided  into four test groups. He prepared four test drugs, involving various [[permutation]]s of the three drug constituents, with a placebo as a [[scientific control]]. The structure of this trial is significant because, in those days, the only time placebos were ever used "''was to express the efficacy or non-efficacy of a drug in terms of "how much better" the drug was than the "placebo''".&lt;ref name="Jellinke"/&gt;{{Rp|88}} (Note that the trial conducted by Austin Flint is an example of such a drug efficacy vs. placebo efficacy trial.) The four test drugs were identical in shape, size, colour and taste:
* Drug '''A''': contained '''a''', '''b''', and '''c'''.
* Drug '''B''': contained '''a''' and '''c'''.
* Drug '''C''': contained '''a''' and '''b'''.
* Drug '''D''': a 'simulator', contained "ordinary [[lactic acid|lactate]]".

Each time a subject had a headache, they took their group’s designated test drug, and recorded whether their headache had been relieved (or not). Although "some subjects had only three headaches in the course of a two-week period while others had up to ten attacks in the same period", the data showed a "great consistency" across all subjects&lt;ref name="Jellinke"/&gt;{{Rp|88}} Every two weeks the groups’ drugs were changed; so that by the end of eight weeks, all groups had tested all the drugs. The stipulated drug (i.e., '''A''', '''B''', '''C''', or '''D''') was taken as often as necessary over each two-week period, and the two-week sequences for each of the four groups were:
#'''A''', '''B''', '''C''', '''D'''
#'''B''', '''A''', '''D''', '''C'''
#'''C''', '''D''', '''A''', '''B'''
#'''D''', '''C''', '''B''', '''A'''.

Over the entire population of 199 subjects, there were 120 "''subjects reacting to placebo''" and  79 "''subjects not reacting to placebo''".&lt;ref name="Jellinke"/&gt;{{Rp|89}}

On initial analysis, there was no difference between the self-reported "success rates" of Drugs '''A''', '''B''', and '''C''' (84%, 80%, and 80% respectively) (the "success rate" of the simulating placebo Drug '''D''' was 52%); and, from this, it appeared that ingredient '''b''' was completely unnecessary.

However, further analysis on the trial demonstrated that ingredient '''b''' made a significant contribution to the remedy’s efficacy. Examining his data, Jellinek discovered that there was a very significant difference in responses between the 120 placebo-responders and the 79 non-responders. The 79 non-responders' reports showed that if they were considered as an entirely separate group, there was a significant difference the "success rates" of Drugs '''A''', '''B''', and '''C''': viz., 88%, 67%, and 77%, respectively. And because this significant difference in relief from the test drugs could only be attributed to the presence or absence of ingredient '''b''', he concluded that ingredient '''b''' was essential.

Two conclusions came from this trial:
* Jellinek,&lt;ref name="Jellinke"/&gt;{{Rp|90}} having identified 120 "placebo reactors", went on to suppose that all of them may have been suffering from either "''psychological headaches''" (with or without attendant "''[[hypochondria]]sis''")  or "''true physiological headaches [which were] accessible to suggestion''". Thus, according to this view, the degree to which a "placebo response" is present tends to be an index of the [[Psychosomatic illness|psychogenic]] origins of the condition in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lasagna L, Mosteller F, von Felsinger JM, Beecher HK |title=A study of the placebo response |journal=Am. J. Med. |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=770–9 |date=June 1954 |pmid=13158365 |doi=10.1016/0002-9343(54)90441-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|777}}
* It indicated that, whilst any given placebo was inert, a ''responder'' to that particular placebo may be responding for a wide number of reasons unconnected with the drug's active ingredients; and, from this, it could be important to pre-[[Screening (medicine)|screen]] potential test populations, and treat those manifesting a placebo-response as a special group, or remove them altogether from the test population!

=== MRC and randomized trials===
It used to be thought&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yoshioka A |title=Use of randomisation in the Medical Research Council's clinical trial of streptomycin in pulmonary tuberculosis in the 1940s |journal=BMJ |volume=317 |issue=7167 |pages=1220–3 |date=October 1998 |pmid=9794865 |pmc=1114162 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9794865 |doi=10.1136/bmj.317.7167.1220}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the first-ever randomized clinical trial was the trial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Streptomycin treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis |journal=Br Med J |volume=2 |issue=4582 |pages=769–82 |date=October 1948 |pmid=18890300 |pmc=2091872 |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4582.769 }} [http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/trial_records/20th_Century/1940s/MRC_bmj/MRC_bmj_kp.html see also]&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC) in 1948 into the efficacy of [[streptomycin]] in the treatment of [[pulmonary tuberculosis]]. In this trial, there were two test groups:
#those "''treated by [[streptomycin]] and [[bed-rest]]''", and
#those "''[treated] by bed-rest alone''" (the control group).
What made this trial novel was that the subjects were randomly allocated to their test groups. The up-to-that-time practice was to allocate subjects alternately to each group, based on the order in which they presented for treatment. This practice could be [[Bias of an estimator|biased]], because those admitting each patient knew to which group that patient would be allocated (and so the decision to admit or not admit a specific patient might be influenced by the experimenter's knowledge of the nature of their illness, and their knowledge of the group to which they would occupy).

Recently, an earlier MRC trial on the antibiotic patulin on the course of common colds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Clinical trial of patulin in the common cold. 1944 |journal=Int J Epidemiol |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=243–6 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15082620 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyh028 |url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/33/2/243 |author1=Patulin Clinical Trials Committee, Medical Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been suggested to have been the first randomized trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chalmers I, Clarke M |title=Commentary: the 1944 patulin trial: the first properly controlled multicentre trial conducted under the aegis of the British Medical Research Council |journal=Int J Epidemiol |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=253–60 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15082623 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyh162 |url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15082623}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early and until recently overlooked randomized trial was published on strophanthin in a local Finnish journal in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hemminki E |title=Commentary on an early placebo controlled trial in Finland |year=2005 |publisher=The James Lind Library |url=http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/trial_records/20th_Century/1940s/elvainio_et_al/elvainio_commentary.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828040111/http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/trial_records/20th_Century/1940s/elvainio_et_al/elvainio_commentary.html |archivedate=2008-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Declaration of Helsinki==
From the time of the [[Hippocratic Oath]] questions of the ethics of medical practice have been widely discussed, and codes of practice have been gradually developed as a response to advances in scientific medicine.
The '''[[Nuremberg Code]]''', which was issued in August 1947, as a consequence of the so-called [[Doctors' Trial]] which examined the [[Nazi human experimentation|human experimentation]] conducted by [[Nazism|Nazi]] doctors during [[World War II]], offers ten principles for legitimate medical research, including [[informed consent]], absence of [[coercion]], and [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] towards experiment participants.

In 1964, the [[World Medical Association]] issued the '''[[Declaration of Helsinki]]''',[https://web.archive.org/web/20090220183350/http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm] which specifically limited its directives to health research by physicians, and emphasized a number of  additional conditions in circumstances where "''medical research is combined with medical care''".
The significant difference between the 1947 '''Nuremberg Code''' and the 1964 '''Declaration of Helsinki''' is that the first was a set of principles that was ''suggested'' '''to''' the medical profession by the "Doctors’ Trial" judges, whilst the second was ''imposed'' '''by''' the medical profession upon itself.
Paragraph 29 of the Declaration makes specific mention of placebos:

{{quotation|29. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be tested against those of the best current prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods. This does not exclude the use of placebo, or no treatment, in studies where no proven prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method exists.}}

In 2002, World Medical Association issued the following elaborative announcement:

{{quotation|Note of clarification on paragraph 29 of the WMA Declaration of Helsinki&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The WMA hereby reaffirms its position that extreme care must be taken in making use of a placebo-controlled trial and that in general this methodology should only be used in the absence of existing proven therapy. However, a placebo-controlled trial may be ethically acceptable, even if proven therapy is available, under the following circumstances:
:— Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons its use is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of a prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method; or
:— Where a prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method is being investigated for a minor condition and the patients who receive placebo will not be subject to any additional risk of serious or irreversible harm.
All other provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki must be adhered to, especially the need for appropriate ethical and scientific review.}}

In addition to the requirement for informed consent from all drug-trial participants, it is also  standard practice to inform all test subjects that they may receive the drug being tested or that they may receive the placebo.

==Non-drug treatments==
"Talking therapies" (such as [[hypnotherapy]], [[psychotherapy]], counseling, and non-drug [[psychiatry]]) are now required to have scientific [[Verification and validation|validation]] by clinical trial. However, there is controversy over what might or might not be an appropriate placebo for such therapeutic treatments. In 2005, the ''Journal of Clinical Psychology'', devoted an issue &lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jclp.v61:7/issuetoc]&lt;/ref&gt; to the issue of "''The Placebo Concept in Psychotherapy''" that contained a range of contributions to this question. As the abstract of one paper &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/jclp.20133 | volume=61 | title=Moving from empirically supported treatment lists to practice guidelines in psychotherapy: The role of the placebo concept | year=2005 | journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology | pages=893–908 | author=Herbert James D}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Unlike within the domain of medicine, in which the logic of placebos is relatively straightforward, the concept of placebo as applied to psychotherapy is fraught with both conceptual and practical problems.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Planmeca’s products are designed and manufactured in Helsinki, Finland, and distributed worldwide via a network of dealers operating around the world. More than 98% of Planmeca’s production is exported to over 100 countries.

== History ==

Planmeca was founded by [[Heikki Kyöstilä]] in 1971. Kyöstilä is the president and owner of Planmeca.

In the 1970s, Planmeca manufactured dental stools and instrument cabinets, and created its first patient chair and dental unit.

The 1980s was a decade of international expansion and subsidiaries were established abroad. Planmeca introduced a microprocessor-controlled dental chair, panoramic X-ray device and dental unit.

In the 1990s, Planmeca introduced a dental unit with an integrated patient chair. The decade was also an era of digital progress – Planmeca introduced an integrated information technology system for a digital dental practice, the all in one -concept. The concept allowed instant access to all digital clinical patient information at chair side via one software.

In the 2000s, Planmeca introduced a dental unit that could be converted from right- to left-handed use with motorised movements as well as the Planmeca Romexis software for processing patient information, dental unit’s user activities and images. Planmeca also introduced a new SCARA technology in its X-ray units, which enabled free formation of imaging geometry.

In the 2010s, the concept of ''Digital perfection'' was launched. The combination of a digital intraoral scan, a 3D X-ray (CBVT) and a 3D facial photo provides comprehensive information on the patient’s anatomy.

== Co-operation with universities ==

Cooperative work between Planmeca and universities in product and software development is widespread.  Planmeca offers solutions designed especially for teaching environments. Planmeca has supplied dental units and X-ray units to universities and hospitals around the world.

== Planmeca Group ==

Planmeca Oy is the parent company of Planmeca Group. The Group operates in the field of health care and consists of six companies.  The Group employs approximately 2,650 people worldwide and the estimated turnover for 2014 amounts to MEUR 800. The headquarters is located in Helsinki, Finland.

In addition to '''Planmeca Oy''', the companies belonging to Planmeca Group are: [[Planmed]] Oy, a manufacturer of mammography and orthopaedic imaging equipment, '''Plandent Oy''', a full-service dental supply company, '''LM-Instruments Oy''', a manufacturer of dental hand instruments, '''Opus Systemer AS''', a developer of dental software solutions and '''Triangle Furniture Systems Inc'''., a manufacturer of dental practice cabinetry solutions.{{clarify|date=August 2012}}

The '''Päijänne Water Tunnel''' ({{Lang-fi|'''Päijännetunneli'''}}, {{Lang-sv|'''Päijännetunneln'''}}), located in [[Southern Finland]], is the world's second longest [[tunnel]] (after the [[Delaware Aqueduct]] in the USA). It is {{convert|120|km|mi|sp=us}} long and runs 30–100 meters under the surface in [[bedrock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The water comes from Päijänne|url=https://www.hsy.fi/en/experts/water-services/water-treatment-plants/Pages/the-water-comes-from-paijanne.aspx|website=Helsinki Region Environmental Services Authority HSY|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hukka|first1=J.

The former [[Porvoon maalaiskunta|Porvoo Rural Municipality]], now merged with the municipality of [[Porvoo]], also took part in the building of the scheme but has never drawn water from it for domestic use.

The tunnel starts at [[Asikkalanselkä]] in [[Lake Päijänne]], which is the second largest lake in Finland, with an area of 1,080 square kilometres. The tunnel slopes slightly downhill so that water flows naturally. Water from the southern portion of Lake Päijänne is of rather good quality at the [[Water tunnel (physical infrastructure)|water tunnel]] intake and is usually drinkable without processing. The tunnel ends at the  Silvola [[reservoir]] in Vantaa in the [[Greater Helsinki]] area. From the reservoir covering 0.5 square kilometres, water is pumped to water treatment plants in [[Pitkäkoski]] and [[Vanhakaupunki]]. Since the constant low temperature in the deep tunnel ensures high quality during transport, only minimal processing is required before use.

Tunnel construction started in 1972 and was completed in 1982 at a cost of approximately €200 million (adjusted for inflation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinginvesi.fi/paijanne/alltypes.asp?menu_id=70|title=Yleistä Päijänne-tunnelista|publisher=Helsingin vesi|language=Finnish|accessdate=2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 and 2001, portions of the tunnel required repair due to rock falls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mikkola|first1=Jannis|last2=Viitala|first2=Raimo|title=Cave-ins in the Päijänne Tunnel and their repair|journal=Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology|date=April 2000|volume=15|issue=2|pages=129–138|doi=10.1016/S0886-7798(00)00040-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lipponen|first1=Annukka|title=Topographical, structural and geophysical characterization of fracture zones: implications for groundwater flow and vulnerability|date=2006|publisher=Finnish Environment Institute|location=Helsinki|isbn=952-11-2346-X|url=https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/39349}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the tunnel underwent an extensive renovation. The southern part of the tunnel was reinforced in order to prevent [[cave-in]]s. During the renovation, from April 15 to December 31, 2008, the raw water for the [[Greater Helsinki]] metropolitan area was drawn from the [[Vantaanjoki|Vantaa River]].

The tunnel has a cross section of 16 square metres (wide enough for a truck) and enables a water flow of 10 cubic metres per second. At current water usage rates, treatment plants take water at a rate of about 3.1 cubic metres per second for drinking water processing. The tunnel can be used as an emergency water reserve during water supply disruption.

      <comment>Add reference to plans for most of building to be demolished.  Remove some material about leaked plans - now those plans are public, the early leak doesn't seem that important.  Reorder.  Use 'Work' correctly instead of 'Publisher' in refs.  Credit to Whitfield not his company, as this is what our sources say.</comment>

'''Rihand Dam''' ({{lang-hi|रिहन्द  बांध}}), also known as '''Govind Ballabh Pant Sagar''', is the largest dam of [[India]] by volume. The reservoir of Rihand Dam is called [[Govind Ballabh Pant Sagar]] and is [[India]]'s  largest artificial lake.&lt;ref name="WWF, SA: NI"&gt;{{WWF ecoregion |id=im0206 |name=Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests |accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rihand Dam is a concrete [[gravity dam]] located at [[Pipri]] in [[Sonbhadra District]] in [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.india9.com/i9show/Rihand-Dam-44802.htm|title=  Rihand Dam  |accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its reservoir area is on the border of [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. It is located on the [[Rihand River]], a tributary of the [[Son River]]. The catchment area of this dam extends over Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh &amp; [[Chhattisgarh]] whereas it supplies irrigation water in [[Bihar]] located downstream of the river.

==Specifications==
[[Govind Ballabh Pant Sagar]] is the  largest man made lake in [[India]].  
Rihand dam is a concrete gravity dam with a length of 934.45 m. The maximum height of the dam is 91.46 m and was constructed during period 1954-62. The dam consists of 61 independent blocks and ground joints. The powerhouse is situated at the toe of the dam, with installed capacity of 300 MW (6 units of 50 MW each). The Intake Structure is situated between blocks no. 28 and 33. The Dam is in distress condition. It is proposed to carry out the rehabilitation works in the dam and the powerhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://irrigation.up.nic.in/rehand_dam.htm|title=  Rehabilitation of Rihand dam  |accessdate=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The F.R.L. of the dam is 268.22 m and it impounds 8.6 Million Acre ft of water.The construction of the dam resulted in forced relocation of nearly 100,000 people &lt;ref&gt;B. Terminski, Development-Induced Displacement: Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges, Geneva, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rihand Dam, Renukoot 1.jpg|thumb|left |300px|Rihand Dam front view]] 

Many [[super thermal power station]]s are located in the catchment area of the dam. These are Singrauli, Vindyachal, Rihand, Anpara &amp; Sasan super thermal power stations and Renukoot thermal station. The high alkalinity run off water from the ash dumps (some are located in the reservoir area) of these coal-fired power stations ultimately collects in this reservoir enhancing its water alkalinity and pH range. Using high alkalinity water for irrigation converts the agriculture fields in to fallow [[Alkali soils]].

[[File:Stanley Gelbier 2017.jpg|thumb|Gelbier reading in the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] library, 2017]]
'''Stanley Gelbier''' (born November 1935) is [[emeritus professor]] of [[dental public health]] and honorary professor of the [[history of dentistry]] at [[King's College London]]. He is a past president of the [[History of Medicine Society]], and the former curator of the [[British Dental Association]]'s museum.

==Early life and family==
Stanley Gelbier was born in November 1935 at Clapton Common, Hackney, London.&lt;ref name=gelb&gt;Gelbier, Stanley. (2017) ''From Public Health Dentist to Dental Historian''. London: Stanley Gelbier. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He is Jewish, and experienced antisemitism in his youth after the end of the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Gelbier, 2017, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He received his pre-clinical training at [[King's College London|King's College]] and clinical dental training at the [[Royal Dental Hospital]] (1957–61).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kcl.ac.uk/dentistry/newsevents/news/newsrecords/2016/Feb/Dental-Institute-Alumnus-of-the-Year---Nominations-for-2016.aspx Dental Institute Alumnus of the Year – Nominations for 2016.] King's College London, 25 February 2016. Retrieved 8 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gelbier, 2017, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he gained a licence in Dental Surgery from the Royal College of Surgeons in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Gelbier, 2017, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
In 1961, Gelbier started his first job as school dental officer for Essex, where he remained until 1967. During some of this time, he also took on part-time dental work in [[Stoke Newington]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gelbier, 2017, p. 62-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, he was appointed house surgeon to the orthodontic and children’s departments at the Royal Dental Hospital. Gelbier recalls in his memoirs that during this post, many years before other articles on the damage to teeth by sugary drinks, he was encouraged to write his first paper about a child with tooth decay who drank about 8 bottles of cola a day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Subsequently he was assigned to the Department of Children’s dentistry, followed by a post at [[The London Hospital]], [[Whitechapel]], and then a lectureship in child dental health at The London Hospital Medical College. He was inspired by the founder of dental clinics for children with disabilities, [[Neil Swallow]], amongst others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Gelbier was professor and head of the department of dental public health at King's College London from 1990 to 2002. He is now professor emeritus there.&lt;ref name="nat" /&gt; He was the first dentist to receive an honorary fellowship from the Faculty of Public Health (then PH Medicine).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/2769/REYNOLDSMedicalEthics2007FINAL.pdf?sequence=2|title=Reynolds L A, Tansey E M.

==Dental history==
Gelbier  was appointed assistant curator of the British Dental Association Museum in 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bda.org/museum/about-the-museum/gelbierfund|title=Support us: Donations – the Gelbier acquisition and conservation fund|website=www.bda.org|language=en|access-date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and full curator in 1987. He became the first U.K. honorary professor in the history of dentistry. His research has ranged from care of pauper children to the lives and work of leading dentists. His historical writings have covered the [[British Paedodontic Society]], the [[International Association of Dentistry for Children]] and the [[British Society of Oral Health and Disability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cloveclub.com/stanley-gelbier|title=Stanley Gelbier – |publisher=Clove Club|access-date=8 February 2018}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Gelbier was awarded the BDA's John Tomes Medal, which honours members of the dental profession and of scientific importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bda.org/about-the-bda/honours-and-awards/john-tomes-medal|title=John Tomes Medal|website=www.bda.org|language=en|access-date=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BDA later honoured Gelbier with life membership in December 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dentistry.co.uk/2007/12/03/norman-freedman-honoured-award/|title=Norman Freedman honoured with award – Dentistry.co.uk|date=3 December 2007|work=Dentistry.co.uk|access-date=9 February 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Gelbier was presented with the [[American Academy of the History of Dentistry]]'s Hayden Harris Award by Dr Sheldon Peck.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bda.org/museum/Pages/what-the-lindsay-society-does.aspx|title=What the Lindsay Society does|website=bda.org|language=en|access-date=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the author of numerous works about dentistry and its history. In 1962 he wrote a paper for the ''Royal Dental Hospital Magazine'' on "Tooth Erosion in a Boy Consuming a High Intake of Cola and Similar Drinks".&lt;ref&gt;"Tooth Erosion in a Boy Consuming a High Intake of Cola and Similar Drinks", Stanley Gelbier, ''Royal Dental Hospital Magazine'', December 1962, pp. 12–14.&lt;/ref&gt; He has written biographies of notable dentists including [[Sydney William Garne]] of Ceylon&lt;ref&gt;"Sydney William Garne LDS RCS FRGS (1875–1946): founding president of the Ceylon Dental Association", ''Journal of Medical Biography'', Vol. 18 (2010), pp. 19–23. &lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Smith Turner]] of the BDA.&lt;ref&gt;"James Smith Turner (1832–1904) and the British Dental Association", ''British Dental Journal'', Vol. 222, pp. 396–399 (10 March 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structural equation modeling''' ('''SEM''') is a form of [[causal model]]ing that includes a diverse set of mathematical models, computer algorithms, and statistical methods that fit networks of constructs to data.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=79-88}} SEM includes [[confirmatory factor analysis]], [[Path analysis (statistics)|path analysis]], [[partial least squares path modeling]], and [[latent growth modeling]].{{sfn|Kline|2011}} The concept should not be confused with the related concept of [[Structural model (econometrics)|structural models in econometrics]], nor with [[economic model|structural models in economics]]. Structural equation models are often used to assess unobservable 'latent' constructs. They often invoke a measurement model that defines [[latent variables]] using one or more [[Observable variable|observed variables]], and a structural model that imputes relationships between latent variables.{{sfn|Kaplan|2007|p=79-88}}{{sfn|Kline|2011|p=230-294}} The links between constructs of a structural equation model may be estimated with independent [[regression analysis|regression equations]] or through more involved approaches such as those employed in LISREL.{{sfn|Kline|2011|p=265-294}}

Use of SEM is commonly justified in the social sciences because of its ability to impute relationships between unobserved constructs (latent variables) from observable variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.22237/jmasm/1067644980 |title=Fortune Cookies, Measurement Error, and Experimental Design |journal=Journal of Modern Applied Statistical Methods |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=293 |year=2003 |last1=Hancock |first1=Greogry R }}&lt;/ref&gt; To provide a simple example, the concept of [[human intelligence]] cannot be measured directly as one could measure height or weight. Instead, psychologists develop a hypothesis of intelligence and write [[measurement instruments]] with items (questions) designed to measure intelligence according to their hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.4135/9781412952644.n220 |chapter=Intelligence Tests |title=Encyclopedia of Measurement and Statistics |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4129-1611-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They would then use SEM to test their hypothesis using data gathered from people who took their intelligence test. With SEM, "intelligence" would be the latent variable and the test items would be the observed variables.

A simplistic model suggesting that intelligence (as measured by four questions) can predict academic performance (as measured by SAT, ACT, and high school GPA) is shown above (top right). In SEM diagrams, latent variables are commonly shown as ovals and observed variables as rectangles. The diagram above shows how error (e) influences each intelligence question and the SAT, ACT, and GPA scores, but does not influence the latent variables. SEM provides numerical estimates for each of the parameters (arrows) in the model to indicate the strength of the relationships. Thus, in addition to testing the overall theory, SEM therefore allows the researcher to diagnose which observed variables are good indicators of the latent variables.{{sfn|MacCallum|Austin|2000|p=209}}

Various methods in structural equation modeling have been used in the sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.4135/9781412953948.n443 |chapter=Structural Equation Modeling |title=Encyclopedia of Epidemiology |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4129-2816-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; business,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.4135/9781412939584.n544 |chapter=Structural Equation Modeling |title=Encyclopedia of Educational Leadership and Administration |year=2006 |last1=Shelley |first1=Mack C |isbn=978-0-7619-3087-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other fields. Criticism of SEM methods often addresses pitfalls in mathematical formulation, weak external validity of some accepted models and philosophical bias inherent to the standard procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11135-017-0469-8 |title=An overview of structural equation modeling: Its beginnings, historical development, usefulness and controversies in the social sciences |journal=Quality &amp; Quantity |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=313–54 |year=2017 |last1=Tarka |first1=Piotr }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Structural equation modeling, as the term is currently used in sociology, psychology, and other social sciences evolved from the earlier methods in [[path analysis (statistics)|genetic path modeling]] of [[Sewall Wright]].   Their modern forms came about with computer intensive implementations in the 1960s and 1970s.  SEM evolved in three different streams: (1) systems of equation regression methods developed mainly at the Cowles Commission; (2) iterative maximum likelihood algorithms for path analysis developed mainly by Karl Gustav Jöreskog at the Educational Testing Service and subsequently at the University of Uppsala; and (3) iterative canonical correlation fit algorithms for path analysis also developed at the University of Uppsala by Hermann Wold.  Much of this development occurred at a time that automated computing was offering substantial upgrades over the existing calculator and analogue computing methods available, themselves products of the proliferation of office equipment innovations in the late 20th century. The 2015 text ''Structural Equation Modeling: From Paths to Networks'' provides a history of the methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Structural Equation Modeling: From Paths to Networks|last = Westland|first = J. Christopher|publisher = Springer|year = 2015|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loose and confusing terminology has been used to obscure weaknesses in the methods. In particular, PLS-PA (the Lohmoller algorithm) has been conflated with partial least squares regression PLSR, which is a substitute for ordinary least squares regression and has nothing to do with path analysis. PLS-PA has been falsely promoted as a method that works with small datasets when other estimation approaches fail. Westland (2010) decisively showed this not to be true and developed an algorithm for sample sizes in SEM. Since the 1970s, the 'small sample size' assertion has been known to be false (see for example Dhrymes, 1972, 1974; Dhrymes &amp; Erlat, 1972; Dhrymes et al., 1972; Gupta, 1969; Sobel, 1982).

Both LISREL and PLS-PA were conceived as iterative computer algorithms, with an emphasis from the start on creating an accessible graphical and data entry interface and extension of Wright's (1921) path analysis. Early Cowles Commission work on simultaneous equations estimation centered on Koopman and Hood's (1953) algorithms from the economics of transportation and optimal routing, with maximum likelihood estimation, and closed form algebraic calculations, as iterative solution search techniques were limited in the days before computers.  Anderson and Rubin (1949, 1950) developed the limited information maximum likelihood estimator for the parameters of a single structural equation, which indirectly included the two-stage least squares estimator and its asymptotic distribution (Anderson, 2005) and Farebrother (1999).  Two-stage least squares was originally proposed as a method of estimating the parameters of a single structural equation in a system of linear simultaneous equations, being introduced by [[Henri Theil|Theil]] (1953a, 1953b, 1961) and more or less independently by [[Robert Basmann|Basmann]] (1957) and [[Denis Sargan|Sargan]] (1958). Anderson's limited information maximum likelihood estimation was eventually implemented in a computer search algorithm, where it competed with other iterative SEM algorithms.  Of these, two-stage least squares was by far the most widely used method in the 1960s and the early 1970s.

Systems of regression equation approaches were developed at the Cowles Commission from the 1950s on, extending the transportation modeling of Tjalling Koopmans. Sewall Wright and other statisticians attempted to promote path analysis methods at Cowles (then at the University of Chicago). University of Chicago statisticians identified many faults with path analysis applications to the social sciences; faults which did not pose significant problems for identifying gene transmission in Wright's context, but which made path methods such as PLS-PA and LISREL problematic in the social sciences. Freedman (1987) summarized these objections in path analyses: "failure to distinguish among causal assumptions, statistical implications, and policy claims has been one of the main reasons for the suspicion and confusion surrounding quantitative methods in the social sciences" (see also Wold's (1987) response). Wright's path analysis never gained a large following among U.S. econometricians, but was successful in influencing Hermann Wold and his student Karl Jöreskog. Jöreskog's student Claes Fornell promoted LISREL in the US.

Advances in computers made it simple for novices to apply structural equation methods in the computer-intensive analysis of large datasets in complex, unstructured problems.  The most popular solution techniques fall into three classes of algorithms: (1) ordinary least squares algorithms applied independently to each path, such as applied in the so-called PLS path analysis packages  which estimate with OLS; (2) covariance analysis algorithms evolving from seminal work by Wold and his student Karl Jöreskog implemented in LISREL, AMOS, and EQS; and (3) simultaneous equations regression algorithms developed at the Cowles Commission by Tjalling Koopmans.

Pearl&lt;ref name=Pearl /&gt; has extended SEM from linear to nonparametric models, and proposed causal and counterfactual interpretations of the equations. For example, excluding a variable Z from the arguments of an equation asserts that the dependent variable is independent of interventions on the excluded variable, once we hold constant the remaining arguments. Nonparametric SEMs permit the estimation of total, direct and indirect effects without making any commitment to the form of the equations or to the distributions of the error terms. This extends mediation analysis to systems involving categorical variables in the presence of nonlinear interactions. Bollen and Pearl&lt;ref name=bollen-pearl2013&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-94-007-6094-3_15 |chapter=Eight Myths About Causality and Structural Equation Models |title=Handbook of Causal Analysis for Social Research |pages=301–28 |series=Handbooks of Sociology and Social Research |year=2013 |last1=Bollen |first1=Kenneth A |last2=Pearl |first2=Judea |isbn=978-94-007-6093-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; survey the history of the causal interpretation of SEM and why it has become a source of confusions and controversies.

SEM path analysis methods are popular in the social sciences because of their accessibility; packaged computer programs allow researchers to obtain results without the inconvenience of understanding experimental design and control, effect and sample sizes, and numerous other factors that are part of good research design.  Supporters say that this reﬂects a holistic, and less blatantly causal, interpretation of many real world phenomena – especially in psychology and social interaction – than may be adopted in the natural sciences; detractors suggest that many flawed conclusions have been drawn because of this lack of experimental control.

Direction in the directed network models of SEM arises from presumed cause-effect assumptions made about reality. Social interactions and artifacts are often epiphenomena – secondary phenomena that are difficult to directly link to causal factors. An example of a physiological epiphenomenon is, for example, time to complete a 100-meter sprint. A person may be able to improve their sprint speed from 12 seconds to 11 seconds, but it will be difficult to attribute that improvement to any direct causal factors, like diet, attitude, weather, etc. The 1 second improvement in sprint time is an epiphenomenon – the holistic product of interaction of many individual factors.

== General approach to SEM ==
Although each technique in the SEM family is different, the following aspects are common to many SEM methods.

=== Model specification ===

Two main components of models are distinguished in SEM: the ''structural model'' showing potential causal dependencies between endogenous and exogenous variables, and the ''measurement model'' showing the relations between latent variables and their indicators. Exploratory and confirmatory [[factor analysis]] models, for example, contain only the measurement part, while [[Path analysis (statistics)|path diagrams]] can be viewed as SEMs that contain only the structural part.

In specifying pathways in a model, the modeler can posit two types of relationships: (1) ''free'' pathways, in which hypothesized causal (in fact counterfactual) relationships between variables are tested, and therefore are left 'free' to vary, and (2) relationships between variables that already have an estimated relationship, usually based on previous studies, which are 'fixed' in the model.

A modeler will often specify a set of theoretically plausible models in order to assess whether the model proposed is the best of the set of possible models. Not only must the modeler account for the theoretical reasons for building the model as it is, but the modeler must also take into account the number of data points and the number of parameters that the model must estimate to identify the model. An identified model is a model where a specific parameter value uniquely identifies the model, and no other equivalent formulation can be given by a different parameter value. A [[data point]] is a variable with observed scores, like a variable containing the scores on a question or the number of times respondents buy a car. The parameter is the value of interest, which might be a regression coefficient between the exogenous and the endogenous variable or the factor loading (regression coefficient between an indicator and its factor). If there are fewer data points than the number of estimated parameters, the resulting model is "unidentified", since there are too few reference points to account for all the variance in the model. The solution is to constrain one of the paths to zero, which means that it is no longer part of the model.

=== Estimation of free parameters ===
Parameter estimation is done by comparing the actual [[covariance matrix|covariance matrices]] representing the relationships between variables and the estimated covariance matrices of the best fitting model. This is obtained through numerical maximization via [[Expectation–maximization algorithm|expectation–maximization]] of a ''fit criterion'' as provided by [[maximum likelihood]] estimation, [[quasi-maximum likelihood]] estimation, [[weighted least squares]] or asymptotically distribution-free methods. This is often accomplished by using a specialized SEM analysis program, of which several exist.

=== Assessment of model and model fit ===
Having estimated a model, analysts will want to interpret the model. Estimated paths may be tabulated and/or presented graphically as a path model. The impact of variables is assessed using [[Path analysis (statistics)#Path tracing rules|path tracing rules]] (see [[Path analysis (statistics)|path analysis]]).

It is important to examine the "fit" of an estimated model to determine how well it models the data. This is a basic task in SEM modeling: forming the basis for accepting or rejecting models and, more usually, accepting one competing model over another. The output of SEM programs includes matrices of the estimated relationships between variables in the model. Assessment of fit essentially calculates how similar the predicted data are to matrices containing the relationships in the actual data.

Formal statistical tests and fit indices have been developed for these purposes. Individual parameters of the model can also be examined within the estimated model in order to see how well the proposed model fits the driving theory. Most, though not all, estimation methods make such tests of the model possible.

Of course as in all [[Statistical hypothesis testing|statistical hypothesis tests]], SEM model tests are based on the assumption that the correct and complete relevant data have been modeled. In the SEM literature, discussion of fit has led to a variety of different recommendations on the precise application of the various fit indices and hypothesis tests.

There are differing approaches to assessing fit. Traditional approaches to modeling start from a [[null hypothesis]], rewarding more parsimonious models (i.e. those with fewer free parameters), to others such as [[Akaike information criterion|AIC]] that focus on how little the fitted values deviate from a saturated model {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} (i.e. how well they reproduce the measured values), taking into account the number of free parameters used. Because different measures of fit capture different elements of the fit of the model, it is appropriate to report a selection of different fit measures. Guidelines (i.e., "cutoff scores") for interpreting fit measures, including the ones listed below, are the subject of much debate among SEM researchers.{{sfn|MacCallum|Austin|2000|p=218-219}}

Some of the more commonly used measures of fit include:
* [[Chi-squared test|Chi-squared]] 
** A fundamental measure of fit used in the calculation of many other fit measures. Conceptually it is a function of the sample size and the difference between the observed covariance matrix and the model covariance matrix.
* [[Akaike information criterion]] (AIC)
** A test of relative model fit: The preferred model is the one with the lowest AIC value.
** &lt;math&gt;\mathit{AIC} = 2k - 2\ln(L)\,&lt;/math&gt;
** where ''k'' is the number of [[parameter]]s in the [[statistical model]], and ''L'' is the maximized value of the [[likelihood]] of the model.
* [[Root Mean Square Error of Approximation]] (RMSEA)
**Fit index where a value of zero indicates the best fit.{{sfn|Kline|2011|p=205}} While the guideline for determining a "close fit" using RMSEA is highly contested,{{sfn|Kline|2011|p=206}}  most researchers concur that an RMSEA of .1 or more indicates poor fit.{{sfn|Hu|Bentler|1999|p=11}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Browne|first1=M. W.|last2=Cudeck|first2=R.|editor1-last=Bollen|editor1-first=K. A.|editor2-last=Long|editor2-first=J. S.|title=Testing structural equation models|date=1993|publisher=Sage|location=Newbury Park, CA|chapter=Alternative ways of assessing model fit}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Standardized Root Mean Residual]] (SRMR)
** The SRMR is a popular absolute fit indicator. Hu and Bentler (1999) suggested .08 or smaller as a guideline for good fit.{{sfn|Hu|Bentler|1999|p=27}} Kline (2011) suggested .1 or smaller as a guideline for good fit.
* [[Comparative Fit Index]] (CFI)
**In examining baseline comparisons, the CFI depends in large part on the average size of the correlations in the data.  If the average correlation between variables is not high, then the CFI will not be very high. A CFI value of .95 or higher is desirable.{{sfn|Hu|Bentler|1999|p=27}}

For each measure of fit, a decision as to what represents a good-enough fit between the model and the data must reflect other contextual factors such as [[sample size]], the ratio of indicators to factors, and the overall complexity of the model. For example, very large samples make the Chi-squared test overly sensitive and more likely to indicate a lack of model-data fit.  {{sfn|Kline|2011|p=201}})

=== Model modification ===
The model may need to be modified in order to improve the fit, thereby estimating the most likely relationships between variables. Many programs provide modification indices which may guide minor modifications. Modification indices report the change in χ² that result from freeing fixed parameters: usually, therefore adding a path to a model which is currently set to zero. Modifications that improve model fit may be flagged as potential changes that can be made to the model. Modifications to a model, especially the structural model, are changes to the theory claimed to be true. Modifications therefore must make sense in terms of the theory being tested, or be acknowledged as limitations of that theory. Changes to measurement model are effectively claims that the items/data are impure indicators of the latent variables specified by theory.&lt;ref name="Loehlin2004"&gt;Loehlin, J. C. (2004).

Models should not be led by MI, as Maccallum (1986) demonstrated: "even under favorable conditions, models arising from specification searches must be viewed with caution."&lt;ref name="MacCallum1986"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.100.1.107 |title=Specification searches in covariance structure modeling |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=100 |pages=107 |year=1986 |last1=MacCallum |first1=Robert }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sample size and power ===

While researchers agree that large [[sample size]]s are required to provide sufficient [[statistical power]] and precise estimates using SEM, there is no general consensus on the appropriate method for determining adequate sample size.{{sfn|Quintana|Maxwell|1999|p=499}}&lt;ref name="Westland"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the considerations for determining sample size include the number of observations per parameter, the number of observations required for fit indexes to perform adequately, and the number of observations per degree of freedom.{{sfn|Quintana|Maxwell|1999|p=499}} Researchers have proposed guidelines based on simulation studies (Chou &amp; Bentler, 1995),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chou|first1=C.

Sample size requirements to achieve a particular significance and power in SEM hypothesis testing are similar for the same model when any of the three algorithms (PLS-PA, LISREL or systems of regression equations) are used for testing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

=== Interpretation and communication ===
The set of models are then interpreted so that claims about the constructs can be made, based on the best fitting model.

Caution should always be taken when making claims of causality even when experimentation or time-ordered studies have been done.  The term ''causal model'' must be understood to mean "a model that conveys causal assumptions", not necessarily a model that produces validated causal conclusions.  Collecting data at multiple time points and using an experimental or quasi-experimental design can help rule out certain rival hypotheses but even a randomized experiment cannot rule out all such threats to causal inference.  Good fit by a model consistent with one causal hypothesis invariably entails equally good fit by another model consistent with an opposing causal hypothesis. No research design, no matter how clever, can help distinguish such rival hypotheses, save for interventional experiments.&lt;ref name=Pearl&gt;{{Cite book

== Advanced uses ==
* [[Measurement invariance]]
* Multiple group modelling: This is a technique allowing joint estimation of multiple models, each with different sub-groups. Applications include [[behavior genetics]], and analysis of differences between groups (e.g., gender, cultures, test forms written in different languages, etc.).
* [[Latent growth modeling]]
* Hierarchical/[[multilevel models]]; [[item response theory]] models
* [[Mixture model]] (latent class) SEM
* Alternative estimation and testing techniques
* Robust inference
* [[Survey sampling]] analyses
* Multi-method multi-trait models
* Structural Equation Model Trees

== SEM-specific software ==
Several software packages exist for fitting structural equation models. [[LISREL]] was the first such software, initially released in the 1970s.

There are also several packages for the [[R (programming language)|R]] open source statistical environment. The [[OpenMx]] [[R (programming language)|R]] package provides an open source and enhanced version of the Mx application.

Scholars consider it good practice to report which software package and version was used for SEM analysis because they have different capabilities and may use slightly different methods to perform similarly-named techniques.{{sfn|Kline|2011|p=79-88}}

==Lawsuits==
===Against the FDA===
In June 2016, GFI filed a lawsuit in a D.C. federal court demanding that the FDA turn over all records related to its regulation of the term "soy milk," after the agency failed to respond to several Freedom of Information Act requests GFI submitted in April 2016. According to [[Politico]]'s Morning Agriculture report, GFI wants the FDA to formally "allow the use of the term 'soy milk,' and says the agency's inconsistency on the matter has led to 'consumer confusion and an uneven competitive landscape.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bottemiller Evich|first1=Helena|title=SNA rallies against block grants|url=http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-agriculture/2016/06/sna-rallies-against-block-grants-214837|website=Politico Morning Ag|publisher=Politico|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against the USDA===
After filing three Freedom of Information Act requests to obtain documents from the USDA related to its open investigation of the [[American Egg Board]]'s allegedly anti-competitive actions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Charles|first1=Dan|title=How Big Egg Tried To Bring Down Little  'Mayo' (And Failed)|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/09/03/437213511/how-big-egg-tried-to-bring-down-little-mayo-and-failed|accessdate=14 August 2016|publisher=NPR|date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; against egg-free Mayo company, Hampton Creek, GFI sued the agency on Monday, August 8, 2016, for failing to respond to the requests in full.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boudreau|first1=Catherine|title=Hampton Creek 'Just Mayo' Scandal Spreads|url=http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-agriculture/2016/08/hampton-creek-just-mayo-scandal-spreads-a-well-worn-path-for-gmo-labeling-enforcement-cattlemen-test-esa-voluntary-conservation-push-215731|website=Politico Morning Agriculture|publisher=Politico|accessdate=14 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to an article on Vice [[Vice Media|Motherboard]], GFI filed FOIA requests in December for meeting minutes and budgetary documents from the Egg Board, but was only given access to documents that had already been made public.

==Open Philanthropy Project grant==
In September 2016, the [[Open Philanthropy Project|Open Philanthropy Project (OPP)]] awarded GFI a $1,000,000 grant for general support.&lt;ref name=grant&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/us-policy/farm-animal-welfare/good-food-institute-general-support |title=The Good Food Institute - General Support |author=Open Philanthropy Project |date=October 2016 |accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The grant was made under OPP’s farm animal welfare effort, which is one of their major focus areas given the large number of farmed animals subject to considerable suffering.&lt;ref name=farm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/cause-reports/treatment-animals-industrial-agriculture |title=Treatment of Animals in Industrial Agriculture |author=Open Philanthropy Project |date=September 2013 |accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effective altruism==
GFI has ties with the [[effective altruism|effective altruism (EA)]] movement, as helping farmed animals is one of EA's major cause areas.&lt;ref name=80k&gt;{{cite web |url=https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/ |title=What are the biggest problems in the world? |date=April 2016 |author= |accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ea&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/ |title=Introduction to Effective Altruism |accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GFI was founded as a sister project of [[Mercy for Animals]],&lt;ref name="bowie"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vegnews.com/articles/page.do?pageId=7568&amp;catId=1 |title=MFA Launches New Sister Organization |author=Richard Bowie |date=March 5, 2016 |accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of EA organization Animal Charity Evaluators' top charities,&lt;ref name=mfa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/organizations/mercy-for-animals-review/ |title=Mercy for Animals Review |author=Animal Charity Evaluators |date=May 2014 |accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and GFI Executive Director Bruce Friedrich spoke on [[Effective Altruism Global|EA Global]] 2016's panel on "Rethinking Meat and the End of Factory Farming".&lt;ref name=eag&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eaglobal.org/speakers/bruce-friedrich/ |title=Bruce Friedrich |author=Effective Altruism Global |accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, effective altruist Michael Dickens wrote an essay explaining his decision to donate $20,000 to GFI, arguing it was among the most promising targets for donors interested in maximizing impact.&lt;ref name=dickens&gt;{{cite web |url=http://effective-altruism.com/ea/134/where_i_am_donating_in_2016/ |author=Michael Dickens |date=November 1, 2016 |accessdate=November 23, 2016 |title=Where I Am Donating in 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal Charity Evaluators review===
In November 2016, Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) named GFI as one of its Top Charities in its annual animal charity recommendations.&lt;ref name=ace-review&gt;{{cite web |url=https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/charity-review/the-good-food-institute/ |title=The Good Food Institute |author=Animal Charity Evaluators |date=November 2016 |accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ACE review lists GFI's strengths as its potential to decrease demand for animal products—possibly much more rapidly than moral arguments—and the focus of GFI's leadership on effectiveness.  Their weaknesses, according to ACE, include its short track record, the difficulty of developing cost-competitive "[[clean meat]]", and the possible difficulties with finding and hiring the right staff.&lt;ref name=ace-review /&gt;

ACE estimates that GFI could use $500,000 to $1 million more in 2017 than it did in 2016.  These funds would likely go to filling their operating reserve and hiring new staff.&lt;ref name=ace-review /&gt;

[[File:Cover page- The immigrant in St. Louis A Survey.jpg|thumb|The Cover Page from The Immigrant in St. Louis: A Survey]]
'''The Immigrant of St. Louis''', a survey (published 1916, written by Ruth Crawford) is a non-fiction book that tells of the average's [[Immigrants to the United States|immigrants]] lives in [[St. Louis]] in the early twentieth century.  It includes many graphs and tables that details the number of occupations, households in what district, births, deaths, imprisonments, etc. from each cultural group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crawford|first1=Ruth|title=The Immigrant of St. Louis: A Survey|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.32136526;view=1up;seq=10|website=Digital Public Library of American|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was one of the first books written and published for [[social work]]. Crawford, throughout the course of the book, emphasizes the need for current citizens to help [[immigrants]] assimilate to living in the United States.  In this manner, all of the data she collected was to work to increasing [[social activism]] and help equalize the members of the St. Louis community.

In this piece of literature, Crawford touches on subjects of:
* The history of immigration to St. Louis
* The immigrants' arrival in St. Louis and the general first immersion
* Where the immigrants lived and their housing conditions
* The types of occupations kept by immigrants
* The typical education levels of immigrants in St. Louis
* The process and manner that immigrants were [[Naturalization|naturalized]]
* How immigrants assimilated to the city institutions
* Immigrants and [[relief agencies]]
* The work of religious and social agencies with immigrants
* The [[Bryan Mullanphy|Mullanphy Fund]] of St. Louis, and its effects for immigrants

'''''The Young Doctors''''' is an Australian early-evening [[soap opera]]. The series was set in the fictional Albert Memorial hospital and primarily concerned with romances between younger members of the hospital staff, rather than typical medical issues and procedures. It screened on the [[Nine Network]] from Monday, 8 November 1976 until Wednesday, 30 March 1983. The program was shown in numerous international locations, particularly throughout the United Kingdom and North America, and also in France and Spain.

==History==

The series was created and produced by the [[Reg Grundy Organisation]] and started a week earlier than the Nine Network's other soap opera, ''[[The Sullivans]]'', which was produced by [[Crawford Productions]]. [[Nine Network]] made it clear only one of the series would be kept after 13 weeks.

After the 13-week trial period ''The Sullivans'' (which had a budget which was three times bigger than ''The Young Doctors'') emerged as the critical success, so ''The Young Doctors'' was cancelled. Fans of ''The Young Doctors'' lobbied Channel 9, who reversed their decision. ''The Young Doctors'' continued in its 6.00 pm slot and had a successful run. After several years, many long running characters left the series and in the final season during 1982 several new cast members were added.

Producer and creator [[Alan Coleman]] also left, and was replaced by Sue Masters shortly before the series finished production in late 1982. Masters went on to produce Grundy's stablemate ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]'' from 1983; several ''The Young Doctors'' cast members, including [[Judy McBurney]], [[Genevieve Lemon]], [[Babs McMillan]] and [[Peter Bensley]] also went into leading roles in ''Prisoner'' after ''The Young Doctors'' finished.

The advent of one-day cricket led to Channel 9 moving the show around the schedules. These factors contributed to a decline in ratings which saw the series cancelled in late 1982. The final episode was aired in March 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theyoungdoctors.com/show/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807123809/http://www.theyoungdoctors.com/show/history.htm |archivedate=7 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the series ended after 1396 episodes, it held the record of Australia's longest-running commercial television drama serial, which was previously held by ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]''. This was later surpassed by ''[[A Country Practice]]'' and then ''[[Neighbours]]'', which is currently the longest-running Australian drama serial.

''The Young Doctors'' also holds the distinction, rare among long-running Australian dramas, of having never won any sort of television award.

Popular Actress [[Peta Toppano]] who appeared in the first season of ''Prisoner'' had also previously appeared in ''The Young Doctors'' for just over a year. One of the more popular cast members was [[Gwen Plumb]], a recipient of the [[British Empire Medal]] and [[Member of the Order of Australia|AM]] recipient for her service to the arts and communities service, who portrayed gossippy kiosk lady Ada Simmonds for the length of the series. The original cast members [[Lyn James]] who portrayed the doctors secretary Helen Gordon and [[Tim Page (actor)|Tim Page]] who portrays Dr. Grahame Steele, appeared to the end of the series, as did [[Judy McBurney]] as Nurse Tania Livingstone who first appeared in episode 40.

The relatively long-running serial also achieved modest international [[cult]] success, particularly in the United Kingdom, where it aired in a daytime slot on the commercial [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network. The programme was shown regionally, meaning each region was free to show the series as and when they liked. [[Central Independent Television]] were the first ITV region to start the serial from January 1982. Most other regions gradually followed over the next few years and  [[Yorkshire Television]] were the last to start in 1988. Central were the first to finish in August 1992, and [[Westcountry Television]] was the last ITV region to air ''Young Doctors'' in December 1995.

==Story and setting==
Despite the medical setting, medical procedures rarely figured in storylines, with most of the stories and plots focusing more on the personal life and romances of the staff. The local Club ''Bunnys'' was another venue for the staff to mingle.

==Broadcast==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
In the United Kingdom the programme was acquired by 13 of the 14 weekday members of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] Network, [[Scottish Television]] never purchased the series. Most of the ITV regions initially screened ''The Young Doctors'' at their own regional pace in their 15:30 slot on Mondays and Tuesdays with ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]]'' on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.
*  [[ITV Central|Central Television]] pioneered the programme in their Tuesday and Thursday 12:30 slot from January 1982 (but it was quickly moved to the afternoon Monday and Tuesday 15:45 slot) while all the other ITV contractors were screening ''[[The Sullivans]]''. This was then increased to a daily 15:30 slot until ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]] ''began in February 1983 and ''The Young Doctors'' shared the slot airing on Mondays and Tuesdays. This continued until 1987 when Central returned the programme to 12:00 and then 12.35 to allow ''The Young Doctors'' and ''Sons and Daughters'' to be stripped Monday to Friday in their respective slots. Following the end of ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]]'' in early December 1988, ''The Young Doctors'' returned to 15.30 at the end of 1988, usually airing Tuesday to Friday until ''Families'' began in April 1990, which took the Monday and Tuesday 15:30 slot. ''The Young Doctors'' was finally moved to 14:50, Monday to Thursday in 1990, and finished 15 August 1992. Central was the first region to complete the series and it was replaced by ''G.P,'' an Australian series set in a busy inner-city clinic. After 6 months, ''G.P.'' was replaced by the New Zealand Medical drama ''Shortland Street'' in March 1993; a new series made by the Grundy Organization, just like ''The Young Doctors'' was.
* [[ITV Wales &amp; West|HTV]] started the series on Tuesday, 4 January 1983 and screened the series regularly on Mondays and Tuesdays, finishing on 18 April 1994.
* [[Granada Television]] and [[Border Television]] switched the broadcast pattern around, and screened ''The Young Doctors'' on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays instead, finishing at Easter 1993 at 3.20pm.
* [[Anglia Television]] started on 3 September 1984, going out Mondays and Tuesdays at 15:30 until 17 April 1990, then changed to Wednesdays and Thursdays from 25 April 1990. It was then moved to Thursdays and Fridays from Friday 6 July 1990 and an additional Wednesday episode returns in January 1991. Then Mondays to Fridays from January 1992 and finally, Thursdays and Fridays at 13.55 until Friday, 2 June 1995.
* [[Thames Television]] and [[LWT]] in London started screening the series initially at 17:15 on Thursdays and Fridays from 23 June 1983 until 1 September 1984, before switching the series to 15:30 slot, to allow ''[[Blockbusters (UK game show)|Blockbusters]]'' the slot. From this point onwards, only Thames broadcast the series. When [[Carlton Television]] took over in January 1993, the series was dropped for 6 months to allow backlog of ''Blockbusters'' episodes to be aired, ''The Young Doctors'' returned daily on 7 June 1993 concluding the programme as an 80minute special from 13:55 on Friday 30 December 1994. 
* [[Television South West|TSW]] Started the series on 1 April 1985, Monday and Fridays at 17:15 until 8 July, when it was moved to 15.30 slot. On 17 October 1988, the series moves to 12:30 on Mondays and Wednesdays but due to network programming resulted in the series becoming weekly during 1989/1990, but returned to twice a week by the end 1990. [[Westcountry Television]] took over in 1993, and continued twice a week until early 1994 when it was increased to three times a week until 20 December 1995 when episode 1101 was broadcast. The series was never completed, even though Westcountry were the last region to still be showing it.
* Years after most of the other regions [[Yorkshire Television]] started the series in October 1988, going out five times a week. In January 1993, they had to skip 215 episodes to enable them to catch up to [[Tyne Tees Television]], as from January 1993, both regions screened exactly the same material. It aired daily at 15:20, until January 1994 when the Friday episode was dropped until the series ended on Thursday 15 December 1994.
* Grampian Television started on Monday, 14 November 1983, increased to 4 episode per week by 1991, and finished Friday, 30 September 1994.
* ''The Young Doctors'' was also aired on [[Sky1|Sky Channel]] from Monday, 6 February 1989. It originally transmitted at 17:00, and from July 1989 when the channel relaunced as [[Sky One]], ''The Young Doctors'' aired regularly at 15.15–15.45 before it moved to the mid-morning 10.30 slot in February 1990. When Sky purchased the newer Australian soap ''[[E Street]]'' in April 1992, they eventually cancelled ''The Young Doctors'' after around 900 episodes in July to accommodate an afternoon repeat of the American medical series ''[[St Elsewhere]].''

==Remake==
In November 2007, the [[Nine Network]] announced plans to remake the series in conjunction with [[FremantleMedia]]. Originally, it was set to be broadcast in 2008 but due to script delays, the premiere date had been pushed back to 2009. The remake was set to be named ''Young Doctors'' (minus "The"). However, at the end of 2008, the [[Nine Network]] officially passed on the idea. The network decided against the remake, instead, confirming a second series of the popular Australian drama [[Underbelly (TV series)|Underbelly]]. [[FremantleMedia]] is currently searching for another television station to contract the programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22775803-5006009,00.html New life for Young Doctors | The Daily Telegraph&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==DVD==
Selected episodes of the serial were released on DVD in October 2006, under the title of ''The Best Romances''. A second set of selected episodes, under the title of ''Classic Cliffhangers'', was released in February 2008. In 1994, prior to the DVDs, a VHS was edited in the UK by "NTV entertainment" collecting episodes A, B (pilots) &amp; 1.

The '''Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland''' (previously [[bill (law)|bill]] no. 29 of 2018) is an [[Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland|amendment to the constitution of Ireland]] which permits the [[Oireachtas]] (parliament of Ireland) to legislate for [[abortion]]. The [[Constitution of Ireland|constitution]] had previously prohibited [[abortion]] unless there was a serious risk to the life of the mother.

The proposal is often described as the '''Repeal of the Eighth Amendment''', referring to the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|1983 constitutional amendment]] which guarantees the unborn the [[right to life]], making abortion illegal unless the pregnancy is life-threatening. The 2018 bill replaces Article 40.3.3° of the Constitution, which was added in 1983 and [[Irish constitutional referendums, November 1992|amended in 1992]].

The bill was introduced to the Oireachtas on 9 March 2018 by the [[Government of the 32nd Dáil#31st Government of Ireland|Fine Gael minority coalition government]], and completed its passage through both houses on 27 March 2018. It was put to a [[referendum]] on 25 May 2018&lt;ref name="IrishTimes9Mar"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/abortion-referendum/government-can-meet-timeline-to-hold-abortion-referendum-donohoe-1.3420911 |title=Government can meet timeline to hold abortion referendum - Donohoe |first1=Vivienne |last1=Clarke |date=9 March 2018 |access-date=9 March 2018 |work=[[The Irish Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thejournal3928550"/&gt; and approved by 66.4% of voters.

==Background==
{{main|Abortion in the Republic of Ireland}}
The British [[Offences Against the Person Act 1861#Abortion|Offences Against the Person Act 1861]], which made "unlawful procurement of a miscarriage" a crime, remained in force after Irish independence in 1922. The 1983 [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Eighth Amendment of the Constitution]], which declares "the right to life of the unborn ... equal [to the] right to life of the mother", was instigated by the [[Pro-Life Amendment Campaign]] for fear that the 1861 prohibition might be weakened by liberal legislators or [[Judicial activism|activist judges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quinlan|first1=John A.|title=The Right to Life of the Unborn--An Assessment of the Eighth Amendment to the Irish Constitution|journal=BYU L.

X]]) ruled that abortion is permitted where pregnancy threatens a woman's life, including by risk of suicide. No regulatory framework within the limited scope of the X case judgment was passed until the [[Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013]], impelled by the 2010 [[A, B and C v Ireland]] case in the [[European Court of Human Rights]] and the 2012 [[death of Savita Halappanavar]] after miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=Catherine|first2=Jennifer |last2=Schweppe |first3=Eimear A. |last3=Spain |title=Article 40.3.3° and the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013: the impetus for, and process of, legislative change |journal=Irish Journal of Legal Studies|date=20 July 2013|pages=1–17|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=2304258}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 act repealed the 1861 act and makes "destruction of unborn human life" a crime. In the three years 2014–2016 a total of 77 legal abortions were performed under the 2013 act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Third Annual Report of notifications in accordance with the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas |url=https://health.gov.ie/blog/press-release/third-annual-report-of-notifications-in-accordance-with-the-protection-of-life-during-pregnancy-act-2013-laid-before-the-houses-of-the-oireachtas/ |publisher=Department of Health|date=29 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illegal [[surgical abortion]]s in Ireland have been practically unknown since the UK's [[Abortion Act 1967]] allowed Irish women to travel to Great Britain for a legal abortion. The [[Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|13th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|14th]] amendments to the constitution, passed in 1992 after the X case, guarantee the right to information about foreign abortions and to travel abroad for an abortion. The number of women at UK abortion clinics giving Irish addresses peaked at 6,673 in 2001 and was 3,265 in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abortion in Ireland: Statistics|url=https://www.ifpa.ie/Hot-Topics/Abortion/Statistics|publisher=Irish Family Planning Association|accessdate=22 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline is partly due to unregulated use of [[abortion pill]]s illegally delivered from [[online pharmacies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/abortion-pill-questions-4002257-May2018/|title=How many women in Ireland request abortion pills?

While left-wing parties and feminists opposed the 1983 amendment and have advocated its repeal, this was not supported by the two largest parties for most of the interim, [[Fianna Fáil]] and [[Fine Gael]]. In the 2010s while both parties' leadership opposed broad liberalisation, some accepted the argument for abortion in cases like fatal foetal abnormalities and pregnancy resulting from rape or incest, which are not permitted by the 1983 amendment. These became the focus of campaigning after the 2013 act. The [[Abortion Rights Campaign]], a pro-choice alliance formed in 2012, holds an annual "March for Choice" in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ní Aodha|first1=Gráinne|title=How Dublin's March for Choice was reported around the world|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/march-for-choice-international-media-3624566-Oct2017/|accessdate=22 May 2018|work=TheJournal.ie|date=1 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-life groups have countered with a "Rally for Life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tens of thousands march in support of Eighth Amendment|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2017/0701/887020-march-for-life/|accessdate=22 May 2018|work=RTE.ie|date=1 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the run up to the [[Irish general election, 2016|2016 general election]], a number of parties committed to a referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment ([[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.labour.ie/manifesto/reproductive-healthcare/|publisher=[[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]]|access-date=5 August 2016|title=Reproductive Healthcare|quote=Our plan for the next five years: Hold a referendum to remove Article 40.3.3 (the 8th Amendment) from the Constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]]|url=https://greenparty.ie/policies/green-party-reproductive-rights-policy/|title=Reproductive Rights|access-date=5 August 2016|quote=The Green Party supports the holding of a referendum to allow the people of Ireland determine whether or not the 8th Amendment should be repealed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social Democrats (Ireland)|Social Democrats]],&lt;ref&gt;http://astaines.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Social-Democrats-2016-Building-a-Better-Future-2016-2026-Social-Democr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sinn Féin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinnfein.ie/contents/39220|quote=Sinn Féin MEP Lynn Boylan joined Amnesty Ireland campaigners and her Sinn Féin colleagues outside Leinster House today calling for a referendum to repeal the 8th amendment.|publisher=[[Sinn Féin]]|title=Sinn Féin support the Amnesty Ireland Repeal the 8th Campaign- Lynn Boylan MEP|access-date=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://workersparty.ie/wpmanifesto/|title=Workers' Party Manifesto|publisher=[[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and a group of feminist law academics published model legislation to show what a post-Eighth Amendment abortion law could look like.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enright|first=Mairead|last2=Conway|first2=Vicky|last3=Londras|first3=Fiona de|last4=Donnelly|first4=Mary|last5=Fletcher|first5=Ruth|last6=McDonnell|first6=Natalie|last7=McGuinness|first7=Sheelagh|last8=Murray|first8=Claire|last9=Ring|first9=Sinead|date=2015-06-28|title=General Scheme of Access to Abortion Bill 2015|url=http://journals.kent.ac.uk/index.php/feministsatlaw/article/view/174|journal=Feminists@law|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|issn=2046-9551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Government of the 32nd Dáil|Fine Gael-led government]] under Taoiseach [[Enda Kenny]] took office after the 2016 election with a programme which promised a randomly selected [[Citizens' Assembly (Ireland)|Citizens' Assembly]] to report on possible changes to the Eighth Amendment, which would be considered by an Oireachtas committee, to whose report the government would respond officially in debates in both houses of the Oireachtas. [[Leo Varadkar]] replaced Enda Kenny as Taoiseach on 14 June 2017 and promised to hold a referendum on abortion in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inews.co.uk/essentials/news/world/irelands-new-leader-announces-abortion-referendum-despite-popes-visit/|title=Ireland's new leader announces abortion referendum despite Pope visit|date=15 June 2017|publisher=|access-date=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Citizens' Assembly, chaired by [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]] judge [[Mary Laffoy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merrionstreet.ie/en/News-Room/Releases/Government_appoints_Chairperson_to_Citizens_Assembly.html|title=Government appoints Chairperson to Citizens' Assembly|work=MerrionStreet.ie|date=27 July 2016|access-date=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; discussed the issue from November 2016 to April 2017 with invited experts and stakeholders, and voted to recommend repealing the existing text and replacing it with an explicit mandate for the Oireachtas to legislate on abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.citizensassembly.ie/en/The-Eighth-Amendment-of-the-Constitution/Final-Report-on-the-Eighth-Amendment-of-the-Constitution/Final-Report-on-the-Eighth-Amendment-of-the-Constitution.html|title=Final Report on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution|work=Citizens' Assembly|date=29 June 2017|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also made recommendations for the consequent legislation, which were more liberal than media commentators had expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGreevy|first1=Ronan|title=Why did Citizens’ Assembly take liberal view on abortion?|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/why-did-citizens-assembly-take-liberal-view-on-abortion-1.3138280|accessdate=22 May 2018|work=The Irish Times|date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assembly's report was considered from September to December 2017 by a special Oireachtas committee of 21 members, which also discussed the issue with invited experts; its recommendations by majority vote were broadly similar to those of the assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/committees/32/eighth-amendment-constitution/|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=22 May 2018|language=en-ie|date=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it said that because of difficulties legislating for rape and incest, abortion should be legal up to 12 weeks' gestation without restriction; on the other hand, it did not favour socio-economic grounds for abortion after 12 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution|title=Report|url=https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/committee/dail/32/joint_committee_on_the_eighth_amendment_of_the_constitution/reports/2017/2017-12-20_report-of-the-joint-committee-on-the-eighth-amendment-of-the-constitution_en.pdf|publisher=Oireachtas|accessdate=22 May 2018|nopp=Y |pages=§§2.19–2.24, 2.37–2.40|format=PDF|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]] [[Simon Harris (politician)|Simon Harris]] opened the Dáil debate on the committee's report by listing the numbers from each county who travelled to Great Britain for an abortion in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Simon |last=Harris |url=http://health.gov.ie/blog/speeches/speech-by-mr-simon-harris-td-minister-for-health-report-of-the-joint-committee-on-the-eighth-amendment-of-the-constitution-dail-eireann/ |publisher=Department of Health |title=Speech by Mr Simon Harris TD, Minister for Health – Report of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution – Dáil Éireann |date=17 January 2018 |access-date=20 January 2018 |quote=In 2016, 3,265 Irish women travelled to the UK alone and we know that Irish women travel to other countries like the Netherlands too.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fianna Fáil]] leader [[Micheál Martin]] declared that he had changed his view on the issue and gave his support for Repeal of the Eighth Amendment and for the Committee's recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Shona |last=Murray |url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/fianna-fil-leader-michel-martin-backs-repeal-of-the-eighth-amendment-36504489.html |publisher=[[Irish Independent]] |title=Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin backs repeal of the Eighth Amendment |date=18 January 2018 |access-date=20 January 2018 |quote=Following a long period of reflection and assessment of evidence before the Oireachtas Committee, I believe that we should remove the Eighth Amendment from Bunreacht na hÉireann and I will vote accordingly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''Note:''' The first clause was added by the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Eighth Amendment]] approved by referendum in 1983. The second and third clauses were added by the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Thirteenth Amendment]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Fourteenth Amendment]] respectively approved by referendum in 1992.&lt;/small&gt;

As the amendment passed, the subsection will be replaced with the following text:
{{quote frame|Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.}}

==Proposed subsequent legislation==
{{see also |Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018}}
The [[Department of Health (Ireland)|Department of Health]] published a [[policy paper]] on "Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy" on 9 March 2018.&lt;ref name="DoHPP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.gov.ie/blog/publications/policy-paper-on-regulation-of-termination-of-pregnancy/|title=Policy Paper on Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy|publisher=|date=9 March 2018|access-date=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provided an outline of the policies for legislation which would repeal and replace the [[Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013]] if the Amendment of Constitution Bill was passed in a referendum. Under this scheme, abortion would be permissible in circumstances where:
* there is a risk to the health of a woman, on assessment by two doctors, without a distinction between physical and mental health;
* there is a medical emergency, on assessment by one doctor;
* there is a foetal condition which is likely to lead to death before or shortly after birth, on the assessment of two doctors;
* up to 12 weeks of pregnancy without specific indication, with a time period after an initial assessment by a medical practitioner and the termination procedure.

The Policy Paper also proposed that:
* medical practitioners would have a right of conscientious objection;
* the termination of pregnancy in circumstances other than those under the proposal would be a criminal offence, but that a woman who procures or seeks to procure a termination of pregnancy for herself would not be guilty of an offence.

On 26 March 2018, [[Tánaiste]] [[Simon Coveney]] announced he would support legislation on the lines of the policy paper, but suggested that this should be [[Entrenched clause|entrenched]] by requiring a two-thirds [[supermajority]] in the Dáil for any later amendment.&lt;ref name="it3441754"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/varadkar-rules-out-coveney-s-two-third-majority-plan-on-abortion-1.3441754|title=Varadkar rules out Coveney’s two-third majority plan on abortion|last=Bardon|first=Sarah|first2=Vivienne |last2=Clarke |first3=Marie |last3=O'Halloran|date=26 March 2018|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was aimed at voters prepared to accept the policy-paper regulations but wary of subsequent liberalisation.&lt;ref name="it3441754"/&gt; Coveney's proposal was dismissed as unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="it3441754"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/simon-coveneys-plan-for-legal-lock-on-abortion-law-in-tatters-468838.html|title=Simon Coveney's plan for 'legal lock' on abortion law in tatters|last=Ó Cionnaith|first=Fiachra|first2=Daniel |last2=McConnell |first3=Juno |last3=McEnroe|date=28 March 2018|work=[[Irish Examiner]]|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 March 2018, the cabinet agreed the general scheme of the proposed "Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy Bill 2018", which health minister [[Simon Harris (politician)|Simon Harris]] summarised that evening in the Seanad.&lt;ref name="seanadstage2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/six-things-to-know-about-the-abortion-bill-1.3442528|title=Six things to know about the abortion Bill|date=27 March 2018|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="schemeofregulationbill"/&gt; The scheme was published online the following day.&lt;ref name="schemeofregulationbill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/General-Scheme-for-Publication.pdf |format=PDF|title=General Scheme of a Bill to Regulate Termination of Pregnancy|date=27 March 2018|publisher=[[Department of Health (Ireland)|Department of Health]]|accessdate=28 March 2018|location=Dublin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May, CNN reported that American-based anti-abortion groups, such as "Let Them Live", have flown to Ireland in order to sway voters to vote No to the amendment. They entered into Ireland by lying to Irish border control about their reason for coming to Ireland, claiming they were only in Ireland to document the event and nothing more, therefore breaking Irish law by their activities—they did not obtain a "Volunteer Visa", required to do voluntary work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/23/europe/ireland-abortion-referendum-american-campaigners-intl/index.html|title=The Americans trying to stop Ireland from voting Yes to abortion|last=CNN|first=Kara Fox,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions to the result==
===Ireland===
;Yes supporters
[[File:REPEAL YES05.jpg|thumb|"Yes" supporters at [[Dublin Castle]] after the Referendum results were declared]]
Taoiseach [[Leo Varadkar]] said: "I think what we've seen today really is the culmination of a quiet revolution that’s taken place in Ireland for the past 10 or 20 years. This has been a great exercise in democracy and the people have spoken. The people have said we want a modern constitution for a modern country, that we trust women and we respect them to make the right decision, the right choices about their own healthcare."&lt;ref name="ITreactions"&gt;{{cite news|title=Reaction: 'The country has listened. Women have spoken'|work=The Irish Times|date=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tánaiste [[Simon Coveney]] said: "For me, the margin of victory is important but equally important is that there is no Dublin versus the rest or no urban/rural divide – in virtually every part of the country, people have voted in big numbers to allow the government and the Oireachtas to change Ireland for the better."&lt;ref name="ITreactions" /&gt;

Orla O'Connor, director of the National Women's Council and co-director of Together for Yes thanked Yes voters, saying: "This is phenomenal. This was a grassroots, people campaign and I think what today will show is that this is a people's referendum. Presuming that these exit polls are correct, the public haven’t just spoken, this is a resounding roar from Irish people about the horrors of the Eighth and how women should no longer be treated as second class citizens in our society."&lt;ref name="ITreactions" /&gt;

;No supporters
[[Cora Sherlock]], of the LoveBoth campaign, said: "This is a very sad day for Ireland, that people have voted for abortion. We need to remember what they have won. All that is being offered is abortion. There has been no talking about why Irish woman travel, what options could have been put on the table."&lt;ref name="ITreactions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ITreactions2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/ireland-s-abortion-referendum-result-in-five-charts-1.3509845|title=Ireland's abortion referendum result in five charts|work=The Irish Times|date=27 May 2018|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Declan Ganley]] tweeted: "I've been thinking about conscientious objection. I will not pay for the killing of Ireland's unborn children, I cannot be a party to it. So there will need to be a way to exempt conscientious objectors taxes from paying for them in any way, shape or form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://twitter.com/declanganley/status/1000484710630477824 |title=Declan Ganley on Twitter|date= 26 May 2018 |accessdate= 30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic Bishop [[Kevin Doran]] said: "While the Catholic Church is a family and nobody ever gets struck off what I'd say to a Catholic who voted Yes is this, if you voted Yes knowing and intending that abortion would be the outcome then you should consider coming to confession."&lt;ref name="IrishCentralReactions"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishcentral.com/news/catholics-yes-sin-confession-ireland|title=Bishop says Ireland's Catholics who voted Yes in abortion referendum sinned and should confess|work=Irish Central|date=28 May 2018|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
UK Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] contacted Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, and posted to [[Twitter]], saying "The Irish Referendum yesterday was an impressive show of democracy which delivered a clear and unambiguous result. I congratulate the Irish people on their decision and all of #Together4Yes on their successful campaign."&lt;ref name="IndepReactions"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/abortion-referendum/theresa-may-congratulates-irish-people-as-pressure-grows-to-liberalise-abortion-laws-in-northern-ireland-36951264.html|title=Theresa May congratulates Irish people as pressure grows to liberalise abortion laws in Northern Ireland|last=Hughes|first=David|work=Irish Independent|date=27 May 2018|accessdate=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she later reiterated her position that abortion is considered a devolved matter in Northern Ireland, and accordingly that the UK government would not intervene.&lt;ref name=IndependentUK2018-05-30&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/northern-ireland-abortion-ban-irish-referendum-theresa-may-uk-laws-a8374741.html|title=Theresa May will not intervene to help legalise abortion in Northern Ireland, Downing Street says|author=Benjamin Kentish, Political Correspondent|work=[[The Independent]] (UK)|date=2018-05-30|access-date=2018-05-31|quote=Prime minister believes issue ‘is a devolved matter', despite mounting calls for her to back reform}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed a statement from [[Arlene Foster]], leader of the Northern Ireland's anti-abortion [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]], whose votes are needed to give May's [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Second May ministry|Government]] its [[Parliamentary majority]], that the issue should be decided by the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]].&lt;ref name=IndependentUK2018-05-30/&gt;

But senior Conservatives, such as Commons Health Committee chairperson [[Sarah Wollaston]] and education minister [[Anne Milton]], backed calls for a free vote on the issue, while [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of parliament|MP]] [[Stella Creasy]] said she would table an amendment on the matter to the Domestic Violence Bill and said that over 150 parliamentarians had expressed support for the change, and Labour's [[Shadow Attorney General for England and Wales|shadow Attorney General]] [[Shami Chakrabarti]] called the issue a test for May's [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=IndependentUK2018-05-30/&gt; May's spokesperson refused to say whether Conservative MPs would be given a free vote in such a "hypothetical" situation, but said that there had been free votes on the abortion issue in the past.&lt;ref name=IndependentUK2018-05-30/&gt;

;Northern Ireland
The result re-opened the debate about the legality of abortion in [[Northern Ireland]]. In all constituent countries of the United Kingdom but Northern Ireland, abortion is legal in many circumstances under the [[Abortion Act 1967]]. Abortion in Northern Ireland has historically been considered a devolved matter to be decided by the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/44275372|title=NI women 'in limbo' over abortion law|date=28 May 2018|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tooth eruption''' is a process in [[tooth development]] in which the [[tooth|teeth]] enter the [[mouth]] and become visible. It is currently believed that the [[periodontal ligament]] plays an important role in tooth eruption. The first [[Tooth (human)|human teeth]] to appear, the [[Deciduous teeth|deciduous (primary) teeth]] (also known as baby or milk teeth), erupt into the mouth from around 6 months until 2 years of age, in a process known as "[[teething]]". These teeth are the only ones in the mouth until a person is about 6 years old creating the primary dentition stage. At that time, the first [[permanent teeth|permanent tooth]] erupts and begins a time in which there is a combination of primary and permanent teeth, known as the mixed dentition stage, which lasts until the last primary tooth is lost. Then, the remaining permanent teeth erupt into the mouth during the permanent dentition stage.

==Theories==

Although researchers agree that tooth eruption is a complex process, there is little agreement on the identity of the mechanism that controls eruption.&lt;ref&gt;Riolo, Michael L. and James K. Avery. ''Essentials for Orthodontic Practice''. 1st edition. 2003. p. 142. {{ISBN|0-9720546-0-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been many [[theory|theories]] over time that have been eventually disproven.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Edward F. ''Craniofacial Growth and Development.'' In the section titled "Tooth Eruption." 2002. pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [http://www.identalhub.com/dental-tooth-development-and-eruption-933.aspx Growth Displacement Theory], tooth is pushed upward into the mouth by the growth of the tooth's root in opposite direction. Continued Bone Formation Theory advocated that a tooth is pushed upward by the growth of the bone around the tooth. In addition, some believed teeth were pushed upward by vascular pressure or by an anatomic feature called the cushioned hammock. The cushioned hammock theory, first proposed by Harry Sicher, was taught widely from the 1930s to the 1950s. This theory postulated that a [[ligament]] below a tooth, which Sicher observed under a microscope on a histologic slide, was responsible for eruption. Later, the "ligament" Sicher observed was determined to be merely an [[Artifact (microscopy)|artifact]] created in the process of preparing the slide.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Edward F. ''Craniofacial Growth and Development.'' In the section titled "Tooth Eruption." 2002. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely held current theory is that while several forces might be involved in eruption, the periodontal ligament provides the main impetus for the process. Theorists hypothesize that the periodontal ligament promotes eruption through the shrinking and cross-linking of their collagen fibers and the contraction of their fibroblasts.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Edward F. ''Craniofacial Growth and Development.'' In the section titled "Tooth Eruption." 2002. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is good evidence from experimental animals that a traction force is unlikely to be involved in tooth eruption: Animals treated with lathyrogens that interfere with [[collagen]] cross-link formation showed similar eruption rates to control animals, provided occlusal forces were removed.

Inherent in most of the theories outlined above, is the idea that a force is generated in the periodontal ligament beneath unerupted teeth, and that this force physically drives teeth out through the bone. This idea may have been superseded by a further recent theory. This new theory proposes firstly that areas of tension and compression are generated in the soft tissues surrounding unerupted teeth by the distribution of bite forces through the jaws. These patterns of tension and compression, are further proposed to result in patterns of bone resorption and deposition that lift the tooth into the mouth.&lt;ref name="Sarrafpour e58803"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarrafpour|first=Babak|last2=Swain|first2=Michael|last3=Li|first3=Qing|last4=Zoellner|first4=Hans|date=2013-03-15|title=Tooth Eruption Results from Bone Remodelling Driven by Bite Forces Sensed by Soft Tissue Dental Follicles: A Finite Element Analysis|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0058803|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=3|pages=e58803|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0058803|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3598949|pmid=23554928}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is based on Wolff's Law, which is the long established idea that bone changes shape in accordance with the forces applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Citation&amp;list_uids=15038485|title=A 2003 update of bone physiology and Wolff's Law for clinicians|last=Frost|first=H.M.|date=Feb 2004|website=|publisher=Angle Orthodontics|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, a recent finite element analysis study, analysing the distribution of force through the jaw of an 8 year old child, observed overall compression in the soft tissues above, and tension in the soft tissues below, unerupted teeth.&lt;ref name="Sarrafpour e58803"/&gt;  Because bone resorbs when compressed, and forms under tension, this finite element analysis strongly supports the new theory.&lt;ref name="Sarrafpour e58803"/&gt; Further work is required, however, to confirm this new theory experimentally.

==Timeline==

[[File:Baby teeth in human infant.jpg|thumb|right|The deciduous [[mandibular central incisor]]s, shown here in the mouth of a seven-month-old female infant, are the first teeth to erupt]]

[[File:ToothLost-2917.jpg|thumb|right|Bottom teeth of a seven-year-old, showing primary teeth ''(left)'', a lost primary tooth ''(middle)'', and a fully erupted permanent tooth ''(right)'']]
Although tooth eruption occurs at different times for different people, a general eruption timeline exists. Typically, humans have 20 primary teeth and 32 permanent teeth.&lt;ref&gt;The American Dental Association, ''Tooth Eruption Charts'' at http://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/az-topics/e/eruption-charts.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The dentition goes through three stages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 191-192&lt;/ref&gt; The first, known as primary [[dentition]] stage, occurs when only primary teeth are visible. Once the first permanent tooth erupts into the mouth, the teeth that are visible are in the mixed (or transitional) dentition stage. After the last primary tooth is shed or exfoliates out of the mouth, the teeth are in the permanent dentition stage. Each patient should be assigned a dentition period to allow for effective dental treatment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Primary dentition stage===

Primary dentition stage starts on the arrival of the [[mandibular central incisor]]s, typically from around six months, and lasts until the first permanent molars appear in the mouth, usually at six years.&lt;ref&gt;Ash, Major M. and Stanley J. Nelson. ''Wheeler’s Dental Anatomy, Physiology, and Occlusion.'' 8th edition. 2003. P. 38, 41. {{ISBN|0-7216-9382-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are 20 primary teeth and they typically erupt in the following order: (1) central [[incisor]], (2) lateral incisor, (3) first molar, (4) [[Canine tooth|canine]], and (5) second molar.&lt;ref&gt;Ash, Major M. and Stanley J. Nelson. ''Wheeler’s Dental Anatomy, Physiology, and Occlusion.'' 8th edition. 2003. P. 38. {{ISBN|0-7216-9382-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a general rule, four teeth erupt for every six months of life, mandibular teeth erupt before maxillary teeth, and teeth erupt sooner in females than males.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmd.com WebMd]. [http://www.webmd.com/content/article/66/79639.htm?z=4208_00000_9003_to_02 "Dental Health: Your Child's Teeth"]. Retrieved December 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; During primary dentition, the tooth buds of permanent teeth develop inferior to the primary teeth, close to the palate or tongue.

===Mixed dentition stage===

Mixed dentition stage starts when the first permanent tooth appears in the mouth, usually at five or six years with the first permanent molar, and lasts until the last primary tooth is lost, usually at ten, eleven, or twelve years.&lt;ref&gt;Ash, Major M. and Stanley J.

Since there are no premolars in the primary dentition, the primary molars are replaced by permanent premolars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charfac.umn.edu/MMS/ProjectMicro/Explorations/Contents.html Monthly Microscopy Explorations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201181929/http://www.charfac.umn.edu/MMS/ProjectMicro/Explorations/Contents.html |date=2005-12-01 }}.

[[Orthodontics]] may be required in such circumstances for an individual to achieve a functioning and aesthetic dentition.

===Permanent dentition stage===

The permanent dentition begins when the last primary tooth is lost, usually at 11 to 12 years, and lasts for the rest of a person's life or until all of the teeth are lost ([[edentulism]]). During this stage, permanent third molars (also called "[[Wisdom tooth|wisdom teeth]]") are frequently [[Extraction (dental)|extracted]] because of decay, pain or impactions. The main reasons for [[tooth loss]] are decay or [[periodontal disease]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perio.org/index.html The American Academy of Periodontology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214140958/http://www.perio.org/index.html |date=2005-12-14 }}.

== Active vs. Passive Eruption ==

===Active Eruption===
Active eruption is known as eruption of teeth into the mouth towards the occlusal plane. This is a natural path of eruption of all the teeth as they emerge from gingiva and continue erupting until they make contact with the opposing tooth.

=== Passive Eruption ===
Passive eruption is known as movement of the gingiva apically or away from the crown of the tooth to the level of [[Cementoenamel junction]] (CEJ) after the tooth has erupted completely. Problems in gingival tissue migrating apically can give rise to what is known as Altered or [[Delayed passive eruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alpiste-Illueca|first=Francisco|date=2011-01-01|title=Altered passive eruption (APE): a little-known clinical situation|journal=Medicina Oral, Patologia Oral Y Cirugia Bucal|volume=16|issue=1|pages=e100–104|issn=1698-6946|pmid=20711147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this phenomenon, the gingival tissues fail to move apically and thus lead to shorter clinical crowns with more square-shaped teeth and appearance of what is known as [[Gummy smile]].

These two groups were further divided based on the position of the [[Alveolar bone|alveolar bone crest]] to the cementoenamel junction.

== Abnormalities ==
Abnormalities in tooth eruption (timing and sequence) is often caused by genetics and may result in [[malocclusion]]. In severe cases, such as in [[Down syndrome#Dental|Down syndrome]], the eruption may be delayed by several years and some teeth may never erupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wysocki|first1=J.

[[File:TPHA test on microplate wells.jpg|thumb|Caption]]

The '''''Treponema pallidum'' particle agglutination assay''' (also called '''TPPA''' test) is an indirect agglutination assay used for detection and titration of antibodies against the causative agent of [[syphilis]], ''[[Treponema pallidum]]'' subspecies ''pallidum''.

In the test, gelatin particles are sensitized with ''T. pallidum'' antigen.  Patient serum is mixed with the reagent containing the sensitized gelatin particles.  The particles aggregate to form clumps when the patient serum is positive for syphilis.  In other words, the patient's serum contains antibodies to ''T. pallidum''. A negative test shows no clumping of gelatin particles.  This is a type of specific treponemal test for syphilis.  

A similar specific treponemal test for syphilis is the '''''Treponema pallidum'' hemagglutination assay''' or '''TPHA'''.  TPHA is an indirect hemagglutination assay used for the detection and titration of antibodies against the causative agent of [[syphilis]], ''Treponema pallidum'' subspecies ''pallidum''.

In the test, red blood cells ([[erythrocytes]]) are sensitized with antigens from ''T. pallidum pallidum''. The cells then aggregate on the surface of a test dish if exposed to the serum of a patient with syphilis. It is used as a confirmatory test for syphilis infection.  A negative test result shows a tight button or spot of red blood cells on the surface of the test dish.  Often a plastic test plate containing many small "wells" is used as the test dish so that many patients may be tested at the same time but their results can be kept separate from each other.  Please note the image of the wells on the test plate and the positive and negative test results look different.&lt;ref&gt;Cheesbrough, M. District Laboratory Practice in Tropical Countries, Part 2, Cambridge University Press, South Africa, second edition, 2006.
&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[primary syphilis]], TPPA has a [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] of 85% to 100%, and a [[sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] of 98% to 100%.&lt;ref name=bmj&gt;[http://bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/50/diagnosis/tests.html British Medical Journal (bestpractice.bmj.com) &gt; Syphilis infection &gt; Diagnostic tests] Last updated: Mar 22, 2012.

Antibodies against other treponemal organisms, such as the ''T. pallidum'' subspecies ''endemicum'',  ''pertenue'', or ''carateum'', can cause false positive results.  A variety of methods exist to adsorb these antibodies from the test sample before hemagglutination.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2404">In [[statistics]], '''verification bias''' is a type of measurement [[bias]] in which the results of a diagnostic test affect whether the [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] procedure is used to verify the test result. This type of bias is also known as "work-up bias" or "referral bias".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=JW|last2=Banerjee|first2=A|last3=Heneghan|first3=C|last4=Pluddemann|first4=A|title=Verification bias.|journal=BMJ evidence-based medicine|date=April 2018|volume=23|issue=2|pages=54-55|doi=10.1136/bmjebm-2018-110919|pmid=29595130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=begg&gt;{{cite journal |author=Begg CB, Greenes RA |title=Assessment of diagnostic tests when disease verification is subject to selection bias |journal=Biometrics |volume=39 |pages=207–215 |year=1983 |doi=10.2307/2530820 |pmid=6871349 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In clinical practice, verification bias is more likely to occur when a preliminary diagnostic test is negative. Because many gold standard tests can be invasive, expensive, and carry a higher risk (e.g. angiography, biopsy, surgery), patients and physicians may be more reluctant to undergo further work-up if a preliminary test is negative.  

In [[cohort study|cohort studies]], obtaining a gold standard test on every patient may not always be ethical, practical, or cost effective. These studies can thus be subjected to verification bias. One method to limit verification bias in clinical studies is to perform gold standard testing in a random sample of study participants. 

In most situations, verification bias introduces a sensitivity estimate that is too high and a specificity that is too low.&lt;ref name=zhou&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhou XH |title=Correcting for verification bias in studies of a diagnostic test's accuracy |journal=Statistical Methods in Medical Research |volume=7 |pages=337‐353 |year=1998 |doi=10.1191/096228098676485370 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vienna School of Osteopathy (WSO)''' is a private educational institution in Austria specialising in [[osteopathy]]. Extra occupational and postgradual trainings are offered for [[physical therapy|physiotherapists]] and [[doctors of medicine]]. University programmes are also open for graduates from other osteopathy schools. Up to now 550 students finished their training and currently 350 students are enrolled in training groups. Established in 1991, the WSO was the first provider of osteopathic training at academic level in Austria. It is located in [[Vienna]], [[Hietzing]] at Frimbergergasse 6.

== History ==
[[File:WSO Logo Transparent.png|thumb|Vienna School of Osteopathy (WSO)]]
[[File:WSO building.jpg|right|320px|thumb|Building of the Vienna School of Osteopathy (WSO) in Vienna, Hietzing.]]
The ''Vienna School of Osteopathy (WSO)'' was established through its funding body ''International School of Osteopathy'' by Raphael van Assche, Margot Seitschek and Raimund Engel in cooperation with Bernard Ligner and the ''Centre International d’Osteopathie'' in [[St. Etienne]], [[France]]. In 1998 this cooperation model was expanded to the ''European School of Osteopathy (ESO)'' in [[Maidstone]], [[Great Britain]].

The first courses were held in the facilities of the ''Kaiser Franz Josef Hotel'' and in the ''Kolpinghaus Währing'' in [[Vienna]]. In 1997 the WSO was relocated to Frimbergergasse 6 in the 13th district of [[Vienna]]. From the very start courses were held by mostly international lecturers.

Since 2005 the university programme ''Master of Science (Osteopathy)'' is offered in cooperation with the [[Danube University Krems]].&lt;ref name="Newsletter 18/2005 der DUK"&gt;[http://www.donau-uni.ac.at/imperia/md/content/donau-uni/mitteilungsblaetter/2005/duk_mb_1805.pdf ''Newsletter 18/2005''] of the [[Danube University Krems]]. Website of the [[Danube University Krems]]. 1 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context scientific work at the WSO was enhanced and further developed. Diploma thesis and master thesis of a series of European osteopathy schools are published in the ''Osteopathic Research Web'', which was initiated and is managed by the WSO. Since September 2009 the ''Teaching Hospital'' plays a vital role in WSO's osteopatic education. It is located in the facilities of the ''Wiener Privatklinik'' in Pelikangasse 15 in the 9th district of [[Vienna]].

== Training ==
[[File:WSO course rooms.jpg|right|320px|thumb|WSO's course rooms.]]
The training at the WSO is separated into two parts, the basic education and the university programme.&lt;ref name="training"&gt;[http://wso.at/index.php/lehrgaenge-kurse/basislehrgang ''Training.''] Website of the Vienna School of Osteopathy (WSO). 1 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''basis education'' comprises 1.200 course units and is a profound and overall osteopathic training, taught by an international team. The university programmes ''Master of Science (Osteopathy)'' and ''Academic Expert (Osteopathy)'' are offered in cooperation with the [[Danube University Krems]] and encompass 1090 and  535 course units, respectively.&lt;ref name="University programme Master of Science (Osteopathy)"&gt;[http://www.donau-uni.ac.at/de/studium/osteopathie ''Osteopathy - Danube University Krems.''] In cooperation with the WSO. Website of the [[Danube University Krems]]. 10 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore the WSO is provider of a broad range of postgraduate seminars.

== Cooperations ==

The WSO is politically tightly linked. It participated significantly in the founding of the ''Austrian Society for Osteopathy (ÖGO)''. Together with the ''Osteopathic Centre for Children (OCC)'' in [[London]], [[Great Britain]] the WSO established the ''Osteopathisches Zentrum für Kinder (OZK)'' as a training centre for paediatric osteopathy, which subsequently became an autonomous institution.&lt;ref name="History and training at Osteopathisches Zentrum für Kinder"&gt;[http://www.ozk.at ''Osteopathischen Zentrums für Kinder.''] History and training. 10 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000 the WSO is involved in the ''Osteopathic European Academic Network (OsEAN')'', which was founded in [[Great Britain]]. The WSO is a member school of OsEAN&lt;ref name="OsEAN Member Schools"&gt;[http://www.osean.com/index.php/component/civicrm/?task=civicrm/profile&amp;reset=1&amp;gid=8&amp;force=1&amp;crmSID=4_u&amp;Itemid=64 ''OsEAN-Member Schools.''] Website of OsEAN. 1 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; with Raimund Engel as president since 2006.&lt;ref name="OsEAN Board Members"&gt;[http://www.osean.com/index.php/osean/board-members ''OsEAN Board Members.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200915/http://www.osean.com/index.php/osean/board-members |date=2014-09-10 }} Website of OsEAN. 1 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The WSO also worked actively in the establishment of the ''Forum for Osteopathic Regulation in Europe (FORE)''. Through its cooperation with ''Fortbildungszentrum Klagenfurt (FBZ)'' the educational institution can offer another course location in [[Graz]], [[Austria]].&lt;ref name="Training of the WSO in [[Graz]] in cooperation with the Fortbildungszentrum Klagenfurt (FBZ)"&gt;[http://www.fbz-klagenfurt.at/index.php?id=166 ''FBZ.''] Training of the WSO in [[Graz]] in cooperation with the Fortbildungszentrum Klagenfurt (FBZ). Website of the Fortbilundszentrum Klagenfurt. 29 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Raimund Engel took part in writing the ''Benchmarks for Training in Osteopathy'' of the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name="Benchmarks for Training in Osteopathy"&gt;[http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js17555en/ ''Benchmarks for Training in Osteopathy''.] Page with link to the original document. Website of the [[World Health Organization]]. 5 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinical practice ==
[[File:WSO training hospital.jpg|right|320px|thumb|WSO's Teaching Hospital at Wiener Privatklinik.]]
In the ''Teaching Hospital'' the WSO offers mandatory clinic days in collaboration with the ''Wiener Privatklinik''. Practicing in the ''Teaching Hospital'' together with supervised treatments form the practical part of WSO’s education. In addition, in the university programmes, practical work is documented in a portfolio.

== Certifications and standards ==

The WSO is certified by ''Ö-Cert''&lt;ref name="Directory of Ö-Cert quality suppliers"&gt;[http://oe-cert.at/qualitaetsanbieter ''Directory of Ö-Cert quality suppliers.''] Website of Ö-Cert. 10 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''CERT NÖ'' and is involved in a certification at European level from the [[European Committee for Standardization]], conducted by the [[Austrian Standards Institute]] in May, 2014. Training at the WSO also correspond with the Standards of the ''Benchmarks for Training in Osteopathy'' of the [[World Health Organization]].

== Management ==

Raimund Engel, co-founder of the WSO, is Managing Director and Erich Mayer-Fally is Medical Director.

The provision of '''water supply and sanitation in New Zealand''' is generally of good quality in urban areas. It is provided by local government called [[Territorial authorities of New Zealand|Territorial Authorities ]] which include 15 city councils in urban areas and 53 district councils in rural areas. The legal framework includes the Health Act 1956  amended in 2007, the [[Local Government Act 2002 (New Zealand)|Local Government Act 2002]] and the [[Resource Management Act 1991]].

Much of rural New Zealand relies on [[Rainwater harvesting|collection of rainwater]] for water supply and [[septic tank]]s for sewage disposal.

==Resources==
New Zealand  enjoys high rainfall, especially along its west coast and the country is notable for its many large, and sometimes [[Braided river|braided rivers]]. However, although the population is relatively small, the population density in North Island is much greater than in South Island where most of the rain falls. 

In rural communities, it remains common-place for houses to be served by their own private supply - usually by the collection of rain-water from roofs. This practice is not constrained by any regulations.

==Sanitation==
All significant sized urban developments are served by municipal [[Effluent sewer|sewer]]s which drain to modern [[sewage treatment works|treatment works]] with final discharges to [[river]] or the [[sea]]. Rural communities and isolated housing is served by septic tanks or by chemical toilets or earth closets depending on location and usage.
The 135 wastewater treatment plants discharge into the following type of environment:&lt;ref&gt;Ministry for the Environment:[http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/waste/wastewater/ How many municipal wastewater treatment plants discharge to land, sea, lake, river?]&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Estuary]]    	5
:[[Groundwater]]  	8
:[[Lake]]  	        1
:[[Earth|Land]] 	        26
:[[Long Sea Outfall]]	22
:[[Near Shore Outfall]]	7
:[[River|River/stream/drain]] 	62
:[[Wetland]] 	         4

==Water supply==
The low level of [[water pollution]] and the relative abundance of rain-fall ensures that water shortages are relatively uncommon. Regional authorities provide abstraction, treatment and distribution infrastructure to most developed areas. Many municipal systems draw water from deep aquifers thus avoiding the cost of long pipelines. Some of these aquifer fed systems such as that serving [[Christchurch]] was of sufficiently good quality that no disinfection of final water was practised until the recent earthquake events. Following restoration of the network the water is no longer chlorinated. Water taken from shallower or less secure aquifers are at risk of contamination. An outbreak of [[Cryptosporidiosis]] in [[Hawkes Bay]] area affecting [[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]] and [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]] has been attributed to the consequences of intensive agricultural in the area overlying the aquifer. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centralfm.co.nz/local_news/cryptosporidiosis-outbreak-napier-and-hastings|title=Cryptosporidiosis outbreak in Napier and Hastings|access-date=31 August 2016|publisher=Central FM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 87% of the population receives drinking water from local authorities,&lt;ref name=OAG&gt;{{cite web|last=Controller and Auditor-General|title=Local authorities: Planning to meet the forecast demand for drinking water|url=http://www.oag.govt.nz/2010/water/part1.htm|accessdate=8 February 2012|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  including 53 District Councils and 5 Unitary Authorities. 

Domestic water usage demand is relatively poorly documented with few authorities collecting relevant or reliable information and several relying exclusively on abstraction volumes as a surrogate for use.&lt;ref&gt;Controller and Auditor-General:[http://www.oag.govt.nz/2010/water/part4.htm#information Measuring how much drinking water is used]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] residential water use was estimated at 180 liters/person/day while total water use including commercial use and public buildings was estimated at 500 litre/person/day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Controller and Auditor-General|title=Local authorities: Planning to meet the forecast demand for drinking water, Appendix 1: Technical information about drinking water supply in the eight local authorities|url=http://www.oag.govt.nz/2010/water/appendix1.htm|accessdate=8 February 2012|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic and financial aspects==
In 2009, the country's infrastructure for drinking water was valued at about NZ$11 billion. For the years 2009 to 2019, local authorities' operational expenditure for supplying drinking water was projected at an average of NZ$605 million each year, and the average annual capital expenditure at NZ$390 million.&lt;ref name=OAG/&gt;

In most of New Zealand, the cost of water supply and sewage disposal is recovered from house holders through property tax as a percentage of the rateable value of the property. In urban Auckland, water use is metered and charged separately from rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.watercare.co.nz/common-content/water-meters/Pages/default.aspx|title=Water meters|publisher=Watercare|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Without Pity: A Film About Abilities''''' is a 1996 American television [[documentary film]] narrated by [[Christopher Reeve]]. This documentary celebrates the efforts of the [[disabled]] to live full, productive lives. It originally premiered on [[HBO]] on October 8, 1996.

The viewers meet a cross section of Americans in the film.  A young woman with [[cerebral palsy]] who cares for her baby, while a man with cerebral palsy lives successfully on his own after 40 years in a Colorado institution.  The film takes a trip to school with a remarkable 6-year-old boy without arms or legs, visits the workplace of a [[Blindness|blind]] computer expert, and meets a professor with [[polio]] who teaches the history of discrimination against people with disabilities.  A young man recently made [[paraplegic]] discusses his daily battle with [[clinical depression|depression]] and his determination and motivation to overcome it and get on with his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uGUlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8qYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4463,2421529&amp;dq=without+pity+a+film+about+abilities&amp;hl=en|title=Reeve Narrates 'Without Pity'|date=6 Oct 1996|work=Reading Eagle|page=TV2|accessdate=29 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This film applauds the resilience and potential of people with disabilities and their need to be determined to be self-sufficient.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9400">The '''Women's Memorial March''' is an annual event held on [[Valentine's Day]] that originated in [[Vancouver]]'s [[Downtown Eastside]], to call attention to missing and murdered women in the district. As of 2009, the Missing Women's Task Force, a joint program of the [[Vancouver Police]] and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], lists 39 women as missing from the Downtown Eastside.&lt;ref name="Elien"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/article-201566/womens-memorial-march-take-place-valentines-day|title=Women's Memorial March to take place on Valentine's Day|last=Elien|first=Shadi |work=[[Georgia Straight]]|date=February 13, 2009|accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4138965 ''Their Spirits Live within Us: Aboriginal Women in Downtown Eastside Vancouver Emerging into Visibility''] Dara Culhane, [[American Indian Quarterly]], Vol. 27, No. 3/4, Special Issue: Urban American Indian Women's Activism (Summer - Autumn, 2003), pp. 593-606, University of Nebraska Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was initiated by [[First Nations]] women in 1992, when the body of Cheryl Anne Joe was found dismembered at the corner of Powell and Salsbury streets. The march became an annual event to protest the high numbers of women missing and murdered in the community.&lt;ref name="CWHN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwhn.ca/node/39432|title=The Global Women's Memorial Website : Creating a circle from which to speak in unison|last=McDowell|first=Christine|author2=Lisa Schincariol |work=Canadian Women's Health Network|accessdate=27 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event has since spread to other [[Western Canadian]] cities, including [[Edmonton]] and more recently, [[Calgary]].&lt;ref name="Wilton"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://calgaryherald.com/health/Hundreds+Calgary+march+memorial+missing+murdered+women/2565359/story.html|title=Hundreds in Calgary march in memorial for missing, murdered women|last=Wilton|first=Suzanne |date=February 15, 2010|work=[[Calgary Herald]]|publisher=[[Canwest]]|accessdate=16 February 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 study by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police found that nearly 1,200 aboriginal women were murdered or went missing between 1980 and 2012 although some investigators believe the numbers are actually far higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Merrit|title=Canada To Launch Nationwide Investigation Into Murdered, Missing Aboriginal Women|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/17/467055203/canada-to-launch-nationwide-investigation-into-murdered-missing-aboriginal-women|accessdate=19 February 2016|agency=National Public Radio|date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence against Aboriginal women in Canada==
By the year 2009, close to 67,000 [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] women who were aged 15 and above reported being subjected to violence within the previous 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Shannon|title=Violent Victimization of Aboriginal Women in Canadian Provinces, 2009|journal=Statistics Canada|date=17 May 2011|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2011001/article/11439-eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About 63% of these were aged 15 to 34 years old.  76% of the incidents reported were non-spousal violence and were not reported to police, as is the case with incidents of violence against [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] women.&lt;ref name=Brennan&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brennan|first=Shannon|title=Violent Victimization of Aboriginal Women in Canadian Provinces, 2009|journal=Statistics Canada|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2011001/article/11439-eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although many of these crimes against Aboriginal women were not reported to police or other service organizations, such as shelters, etc., 98% of women victimized told an informal source such as a friend or family member.&lt;ref name=Brennan /&gt;

===Women's Memorial March in Downtown Eastside, Vancouver===
According to Dara Culhane, "''the annual [[Valentine's Day]] Women's Memorial March gives political expression to a complex process through which Aboriginal women here are struggling to change the language, metaphors, and image through which they come to be (re)known as they emerge into public visibility"''.&lt;ref name=Culhane&gt;{{cite journal|last=Culhane|first=Dara|title=Their Spirits Live Within Us: Aboriginal Women in Downtown Eastside Vancouver Emerging into Visibility|journal=American Indian Quarterly|year=2003|volume=27|series=3/4|issue=Urban American Indian Women's Activism}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Women's Memorial March originated in 1991 in inner city [[Vancouver]] on February 14 as a day of remembrance to honor those women who have been murdered or missing.&lt;ref name=Culhane/&gt;

Since 1983, there has been a reported 61 cases of mostly Aboriginal women who are missing in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside.&lt;ref name=Culhane/&gt;  Marches such as the Women's Memorial bring to light what Culhane terms the visibility of Aboriginal women.  Women's Memorial Marches are not just held in Vancouver, but also [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]] and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]],BC.&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Jamie|title=Addressing Violence Against Aboriginal Women: FNSP Practicum 2009/10 for Battered Women's Support Services|date=October 2009 – February 2010 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case studies===
Some specific cases which illustrate the depth of the problem of violence against aboriginal women in Canada were highlighted in a report by [[Amnesty International]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stolen Sisters: A human rights response to discrimination and violence against Indigenous women in Canada|url=https://www.amnesty.ca/research/reports/stolen-sisters-a-human-rights-response-to-discrimination-and-violence-against-indig|website=Amnesty International Canada|publisher=Amnesty International Canada|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include the murder of 19-year-old '''Helen Betty Osborne''' who was killed November 12, 1971 after a night out with friends in [[The Pas]], [[Manitoba]], a town of 6,000 which was segregated between Indigenous and non-indigenous [[Canadians]].  She was accosted by four non-indigenous men at 2 a.m. while walking back to her house.  Osborne refused to have sex with the men, and was then forced into their car where she was beaten and sexually assaulted.  She was then taken to a local cabin, beaten some more and stabbed to death.

The police who were assigned to the case failed to act on specific tips that pointed to the four likely perpetrators.  The car that was used during the crime was not searched until a year later (1972).  By 1972, police concluded that they didn't have enough evidence for the case.  Only twenty years later did the [[Manitoba]] Justice Inquiry conclude that the murder was indeed fueled by [[racism]] and [[sexism]].  Charges were eventually brought in October 1986 when new evidence was released.  Dwayne Johnson was found guilty in 1987 and sentenced to life in prison.  Among the other men, one was acquitted and the others never charged.

An example of the perceived indifference to the disappearance of Indigenous women is seen in the case of '''Shirley Lonethunder,''' a [[Cree]] woman from the White Bear First Nations reserve in [[Saskatchewan]] who was last seen by family in December 1991.  At the time, she was a 25-year-old mother of two. She was a drug user and occasionally worked in the sex trade, according to family members. The family became aware that she was missing in March 1992, when Lonethunder's attorney contacted them to say she had missed a court date. According to Lonethunder's relatives, [[Saskatoon]] police investigators showed little interest in the case. Six months after filing a missing person report for his sister, Lonethunder's brother contacted the police to ask about progress on the case, only to be told they had no record of the report.

'''[[Zimbabwe]]''' has been competing at the [[Paralympic Games]] since the country [[History of Zimbabwe|became independent]] in 1980; it had previously competed as [[Rhodesia]]. Zimbabwe was absent from the Games in 1988 and 1992, returning in 1996 with a two-man delegation, and has competed at every edition of the [[Summer Paralympics]] since then. It has never taken part in the [[Winter Paralympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=ZIM&amp;gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;sport=all&amp;games=all Zimbabwe at the Paralympics], [[International Paralympic Committee]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimbabweans have won a total of 2 gold medals, 9 silver, and 6 bronze. The country's most successful year, by far, was 1980, when Zimbabweans won 8 silver medals and 4 bronze - all but two won by [[Sandra James]] and [[Eileen Robertson]], across events in several sports. Zimbabwe's first gold medal was won by [[Elliot Mujaji]] in 2000, in the 100m sprint (T46 category).  Mujaji won Zimbabwe's second (and most recent) Paralympic gold medal in the same event four years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=ZIM&amp;gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;sport=all&amp;games=all Zimbabwe at the Paralympics], International Paralympic Committee&lt;/ref&gt; Zimbabwe have since failed to win any medals after 2004.

The [[Zimbabwe National Paralympic Committee]] was only officially launched and registered in 2010. Prior to this, "the government provided financial aid during the Paralympic Games, [but] there was no co-ordinated mechanism to maintain athletes' momentum between the Games", and athletes "had to find their own sponsor, coach and manager who would finance the training, travelling and their participation at competitions".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimparalympic.org/about-us/history/ "About us: History"], Zimbabwe National Paralympic Committee&lt;/ref&gt;
