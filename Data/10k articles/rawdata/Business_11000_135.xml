      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4678">'''Aleksandar "Aco" Đukanović''' ({{lang-cnr|Ацо Ђукановић}}) is a controversial [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] businessman, widely considered to be one of the richest and most powerful individuals in the country, along with [[Brano Mićunović]]. [[Vesko Barović]], [[Dragan Brković]] and others from the Montenegrin [[nouveau riche]] class that emerged during the 1990s following the break-up of [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. All of Aco Đukanović's wealth and influence were achieved during his older brother [[Milo Đukanović]]'s rule in Montenegro as Prime Minister and President of the Republic (1991–2006) and currently as the ruling political party's ([[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|DPS]]) president and prime minister again (2006–present).

==Life==
===Early activities===
Aco Đukanović's early business activity during the 1990s was folk concert booking, promotion and organizing through his first company Maraton.

===2000s===
Aco Đukanović was in the news when along with Vladislav "Pajo" Jabučanin he physically attacked and beat up [[Liberal Alliance of Montenegro|LSCG]] activist Zoran "Feki" Kljajić.[http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2000&amp;mm=06&amp;dd=05&amp;nav_category=1&amp;nav_id=7404] The attack occurred on Sunday, June 4, 2000 at around 11:30pm in the lobby of Hotel Crna Gora in [[Podgorica]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20020909123203/http://www.medijaklub.cg.yu/zanimljivi/zanimljivi06-00/06-1.htm] Kljajić ended up with severe injuries - skull fracture on the forehead for which he underwent emergency surgery.[http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2000/06/07/srpski/H00060601.shtm] Jabučanin and Đukanović were detained by police.[http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2000/06/07/srpski/H00060602.shtm] The case against Đukanović dragged in the courts for years before being acquitted in December 2004 while Jabučanin got sentenced to 4 months in prison.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110722174111/http://www.pobjeda.co.me/citanje.php?datum=2004-12-10&amp;id=49533] On appeal, the re-trial was ordered, but in 2007 on the very first session of the re-trial the court concluded that the suit against Đukanović is too old.[https://web.archive.org/web/20090810125212/http://www.monitorcg.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=742%3Abracova-vremena&amp;catid=346%3Abroj-970&amp;Itemid=584]

His current company Monte Nova is prominent as a Montenegrin business - according to an annual report by [[Central Bank of Montenegro|Montenegrin Central Bank]], Monte Nova is the fourth most profitable company in Montenegro (most profitable among the companies with domestic ownership) with a profit of [[euro|€]]8.1 million in year 2006.&lt;small&gt;[http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/story.php?vest=77288]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/small&gt; In November 2006, Monte Nova acquired [[Nikšićka banka]]. Monte Nova reportedly also holds substantial influence in Elektroprivreda CG (Montenegrin hydro company) as it is trying to take over [[Pljevlja]] [[coal mine]] (accounting for 100% of Montenegro's coal production) and [[thermal power station]] (accounting for 45% of power supply within the republic).&lt;small&gt;[http://www.revija92.novosti.rs/code/navigate.php?Id=215]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/small&gt;

Đukanović also held stake in [[Crnogorska komercijalna banka]], which he sold to Hungarian [[OTP Bank]], reportedly for [[euro|€]]10 million.

In January 2007, he bought 75% stake in Montenegrin urbanism authority for [[euro|€]]2.7 million.&lt;small&gt;[http://www.b92.net/biz/vesti/region.php?yyyy=2007&amp;mm=01&amp;dd=21&amp;nav_id=228622&amp;fs=1]&lt;/small&gt;

Around the same time he bought the documentation for the third [[mobile telephony|mobile operator]] licence in Montenegro but ended up not placing an official bid, and the licence went to [[Telekom Srbija]].&lt;small&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110725141251/http://www.danas.rs/20070216/ekonomija1.html#1]&lt;/small&gt;

A '''charterparty''' (sometimes '''charter-party''') is a maritime contract between a [[shipowner]] and a  "charterer" for the hire of either a ship for the carriage of passengers or cargo, or a yacht for pleasure purposes.
 
The name "charterparty" is an [[anglicisation]] the [[French language|French]] ''charte partie'', or "split paper", i.e. a document written in duplicate so that each party retains half.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Charter-party|volume=5|pages=953}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[Latin]] term ''charta partita'' is a [[back-formation]], and not a true etymological source.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of charterparty==
{{main|Chartering (shipping)}}
There are three main types of charterparty: '''time, voyage''' and '''demise and another
''':
* In a '''[[demise charter|demise]] (or bareboat) charter''', the charterer takes responsibility for the crewing and maintenance of the ship during the time of the charter. He assumes the legal responsibilities of the owner, and is known as a disponent owner.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
* In a '''[[time charter]]''', the vessel is hired for a specific amount of time. The shipowner manages the vessel but the charterer gives orders for the employment of the vessel, and may sub-charter the vessel on a time charter or voyage charter basis. 
* In a '''[[voyage charter]]''', the charterer hires the vessel for a single voyage, but the shipowner provides the master, crew, [[bunkers]] and supplies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maritimeknowhow.com/English/Know-How/Chartering/types_of_contracts_of_affreightment/voyage_charter.html Maritimeknowhow website: voyage charter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714034807/http://www.maritimeknowhow.com/English/Know-How/Chartering/types_of_contracts_of_affreightment/voyage_charter.html |date=July 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A demise charter operates as a long lease of the vessel, with the charterer completely in charge.  In time and voyage charters, the shipowner still runs the ship, but when in port the charterer becomes responsible for loading and unloading the ship within the agreed period of [[laytime]]. If the charterer exceeds the allowed laytime, [[demurrage]]&lt;ref&gt;"Demurrage" is a form of [[liquidated damages]], a penalty for exceeding laytime.&lt;/ref&gt; becomes payable.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Suisse Atlantique Societe d'Armament SA v NV Rotterdamsche Kolen Centrale|Suisse Atlantique]]" case&lt;/ref&gt;

In a voyage charter, the route is pre-arranged and the charterer has little scope to interfere with the programme. By contrast, the time charter is almost a halfway-house between a demise charter and a voyage charter, in that the charterer decides on the voyages and the ports, and instructs the shipowner's crew to comply. This can lead to issues of [[indemnity]]: whereas the shipowner in a voyage charter takes responsibility for the ship, in a time charter the shipowner may need to be indemnified against losses or liabilities [[Proximate cause|proximately caused]] by the charterer.

==Legal aspects of charterparties==

Whereas a charterparty is the contract between a shipowner and a charterer, a contract of carriage lies between the shipper and the carrier. A carrier will issue a shipper with a [[bill of lading]], a receipt for cargo shipped which also serves as evidence of the contract of carriage. (In a demise charter, the charterer is the carrier; in a time or voyage charter the shipowner is the carrier).

The US  [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act]] (COGSA), and the UK [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971]] (which ratifies and incorporates the [[Hague-Visby Rules]]) do NOT apply to charterparties, but do apply to bills of lading (and similar documents such as ships delivery orders, or sea waybills).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When a bill of lading is issued to a charterer by the shipowner, the question arises as to which is the dominant document.&lt;ref&gt;''The Draupner'' [1910] AC 450, HL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Henryk Sif'' [1982] 1 LL R 456&lt;/ref&gt; If a shipper returns a bill of lading to a carrier (perhaps as a [[Pledge (law)|pledge]]), the carrier will hold it only as a token of the pledge.

In both USA and the UK, the COGSA legislation provide a statement of the minimum duties that a carrier owes to the cargo-owner.  If the charterer has shipped cargo, charterparty document may incorporate the COGSA or the Harter Act, since the charter is also a cargo-owner. Such an incorporation is valid and enforceable even without the issuance of a bill of lading. In the reverse case, if a carrier issues a third-party shipper with a bill of lading that incorporates charterparty terms, the shipper/cargo-owner would not be liable for fees such as [[demurrage]], which are payable only by a charter.

Lawsuits brought for the breach of an obligation under a charterparty fall within admiralty jurisdiction. If a breach of charter terms creates a maritime lien, the suit may be ''in rem'' (i.e. against the vessel itself).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In pleasure boating, the most frequent charter arrangement is bareboat [[yacht charter]]. A voyage or time charter is used only for larger yachts and is uncommon. Yacht charter flotillas are mostly made up of boats belonging to individuals or companies who only use their boats on a part-time basis or as an investment. A recent innovation in recreational boating is "time-share chartering" whereby several charterers are assigned a certain number of days per month or season in a manner which resembles real-estate time-share.

==Typical clauses==

A charterparty may contain these clauses.

===Bunker clause===

A [[bunkers|bunker]] clause stipulates that the charterer shall accept and pay for all fuel oil in the vessel's bunkers at port of delivery and conversely, (owners) shall pay for all fuel oil in the vessel's bunkers at port of re-delivery at current price at the respective ports. It is customary to agree upon a certain minimum and maximum quantity in bunkers on re-delivery of the vessel. Since the [[OW Bunker]] test case, ship operators need to take care to ensure that bunker supply terms are suitable.

===Ship clause===

Under this clause, the owner of the ship writes clearly that the ship would be seaworthy at the start of the voyage in every respect, in other words, the ship would be appropriate to travel to the country for which it is taken.

===Ice clause===

An ice clause is inserted in a [[bill of lading]] or a charterparty when a vessel is bound for a port or ports which may be closed to shipping by ice when the vessel arrives or after the vessel's arrival.

===Lighterage clause===

A lighterage clause is inserted into charter-parties which show as port of discharge any safe port in a certain range, e.g. Havre/Hamburg range.

===Negligence clause===

A negligence clause tends to exclude shipowner's or carrier's liability for loss or damage resulting from an act, default or neglect of the master, mariner, pilot or the servants of the carrier in the navigation of manoeuvring of a ship, not resulting, however, from want of due diligence by the owners of the ship or any of them or by the ship's husband or manager.

===Ready berth clause===

A ready berth clause is inserted in a charterparty, ''i.e.'' a stipulation to the effect that [[layday]]s will begin to count as soon as the vessel has arrived at the port of loading or discharge "whether in berth or not". It protects shipowner's interests against delays which arise from ships having to wait for a [[berth (moorings)|berth]].

'''Daniel Truett Cathy''' (born March 1, 1953) is an American [[billionaire]] businessman. He is chairman, president, and CEO of fast-food chain [[Chick-fil-A]], which was founded and expanded by his father, [[S. Truett Cathy]].

==Early life==
Cathy was born in [[Jonesboro, Georgia]] in 1953 as the second child and first son of Jeanette (McNeil) and [[S. Truett Cathy]]. His father had recently started a restaurant known as the Dwarf House. Cathy has an older sister Trudy and younger brother, [[Bubba Cathy]]. In addition their family fostered numerous children over the years. 

He began doing radio commercials for his father's original Dwarf House restaurant in [[Hapeville, Georgia]] in the late 1960s, while he was attending local schools. By that time, his father was establishing additional restaurants around Atlanta and Georgia as he created the franchise chain known as [[Chick-fil-A]].

Cathy earned a bachelor's degree in business administration from [[Georgia Southern University]] in 1975. After graduation, he began working full-time for his father's company, which had already been established as a franchise chain.&lt;ref name="gatlin1998"&gt;Gatlin, Greg (October 7, 1998). [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/34869147.html?dids=34869147:34869147&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT "Chick-fil-A hatches expansion plans"], ''[[Boston Herald]]''; accessed September 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Cathy started as director of operations, eventually being promoted in 2013 to president and CEO. Cathy spends much of his time visiting the chain's 2,000 restaurants.

Cathy holds honorary doctorates from the [[University of West Georgia]], [[Anderson University (South Carolina)|Anderson College]], Carver Bible College, and [[Pepperdine University]]. His family runs the [[WinShape Foundation]], a non-profit which supports a group of [[Southern Baptist]] ministries.

==Same-sex marriage==
{{see also|Chick-fil-A same-sex marriage controversy}}
Cathy has said that he disagrees with [[same-sex marriage]], and supports conservative Christian causes.&lt;ref name="severson212"&gt;Severson, Kim (July 25, 2012). [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/26/us/gay-rights-uproar-over-chick-fil-a-widens.html "Chick-fil-A Thrust Back Into Spotlight on Gay Rights"], ''[[New York Times]]''; accessed September 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

But in March 2014, he told the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' that it had been a "mistake" for the WinShape Foundation to "support political or social agendas" in the period before 2012, when this was reported and a national controversy broke out at a time of debate about same-sex marriages. 

He has been working with [[LGBT]] activist Shane Windmeyer of [[Campus Pride]] since 2012. Windmeyer stated that WinShape and the Chick-fil-A Foundation had "dramatically" cut donations to groups considered to be anti-gay by gay marriage supporters. 

Cathy said that, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"While we evaluate individual donations on an annual basis, our giving is focused on three key areas: youth and education, leadership and family enrichment and serving the local communities in which we operate. Our intent is to not support political or social agendas. This has been the case for more than 60 years. The Chick-fil-A culture and service tradition in our restaurants is to treat every person with honor, dignity and respect and to serve great food with genuine hospitality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myajc.com/news/business/cathy-seeks-to-put-gay-marriage-flap-behind-chick-/nfCHj|title="Cathy Seeks to Put Gay Marriage Flap Behind Chick-fil-A" ''www.myajc.com'' March 14, 2014|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://goqnotes.com/27860/new-chick-fil-a-filings-show-decrease-in-anti-lgbt-funding "New Chick-fil-A filings show decrease in anti-LGBT funding"], goqnotes.com; accessed September 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
==Personal life==
Cathy is married, with two children. He and his family live in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt;

'''David Jules Enrich''' (born July 3, 1979) is an American author, reporter and editor. He is currently financial editor at ''[[The New York Times]]'' based in New York and was previously financial enterprise editor at ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.

==Career==
Enrich worked as an intern at The Nation in the Summer of 2000 and at [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] in 2001. Enrich received his bachelor's degree in 2001 from [[Claremont McKenna College]] in Claremont, California. While in college, Enrich co-founded claremontmckenna.com, the first online newspaper at the five Claremont Colleges. He also founded and directed Citizens for True Democracy, a Southern California grassroots organization that proposes replacing the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] with direct voting.

Enrich joined the ''Journal'' in December 2007 in New York as a reporter writing about the U.S. banking industry, with a particular focus on [[Citigroup]]. Prior to joining the Journal, he was a reporter with [[Dow Jones Newswire]]s for several years. Before that he was a reporter for States News Service in Washington, D.C. He served as a Washington correspondent covering [[United States Congress|Congress]], the [[White House]] and federal regulatory agencies for several regional newspapers including the ''[[Cleveland Plain Dealer]]'', the ''[[Wisconsin State Journal]]'' and the ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]''.

Enrich has received numerous journalism awards, including in 2012 an [[Overseas Press Club]] award for coverage of the [[European debt crisis]], a [[George Polk Award]] for coverage of insider trading, two [[SABEW]] awards and a [[Gerald Loeb Award]] for feature writing for “The Unraveling of Tom Hayes.” Enrich was also part of teams of Journal reporters who were finalists for [[Pulitzer Prize]]s in 2009 and 2011.

On October 17, 2013, a British judge ordered Enrich and ''The Wall Street Journal'' to comply with a request by the U.K.'s [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)|Serious Fraud Office]] prohibiting the newspaper from publishing names of individuals in the government's ongoing investigation into the [[Libor scandal]]. Enrich was threatened with jail if he disobeyed. The situation was covered in the press as an example of the restrictions the media face in the U.K. from courts that impose reporting restrictions to prevent journalists from reporting details that prosecutors believe could jeopardize an investigation or case and by celebrities keen to cover up indiscretions. [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]], publisher of the Journal, described the injunction as "serious affront to press freedom." On October 21, an English judge said he wouldn't renew the court order saying there was "no basis" for the reporting restrictions.

In 2016, Enrich returned to New York from London, where he had been European banking editor for ''The Wall Street Journal'', in order to lead a financial-enterprise team tasked with writing in depth on markets, money flows and other aspects of Wall Street. Enrich was threatened with jail if he disobeyed.

His book, ''The Spider Network: The Wild Story of a Math Genius, a Gang of Backstabbing Bankers, and One of the Greatest Scams in Financial History'', was published in March 2017 to critical acclaim. ''[[National Review]]'' called ''The Spider Network'' "a nonfiction epic...an engrossing, entertaining tale." ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]'' called it an "exhaustively reported tale" and author [[Harlan Coban]] praised it as a "terrific nonfiction book." ''The New York Times'' called it a "vivid depiction of the ethos of the core financial institutions upon which the global economy depends." CNBC and the FT recommended the book as one of their summer reads. It was also shortlisted for the 2017 [[Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award|''Financial Times'' and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award]].

In August 2017, ''The New York Times'' announced that they had hired Enrich.

In early 2018, David broke the news on Twitter that he will be writing another book, on Deutsche Bank.

'''Downtown Edmonton''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]]. Located at the geographical centre of the city, the downtown area is bounded by 109 Street to the west, 105 Avenue to the north, 97 Street to the east, 97 Avenue and Rossdale Road to the south, and the [[North Saskatchewan River]] to the southeast.

Surrounding neighbourhoods include [[Oliver, Edmonton|Oliver]] to the west, [[Queen Mary Park]], [[Central McDougall]], and [[McCauley, Edmonton|McCauley]] to the north, [[Boyle Street]] and [[Riverdale, Edmonton|Riverdale]] to the east, and [[Rossdale, Edmonton|Rossdale]] to the south.

The residents of Downtown Edmonton are represented by the Downtown Edmonton [[Neighborhood council|Community League]], established in 1999, which runs a [[Community centre|community hall]] located at 100 Avenue and 103 Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.decl.org/about/ |title=Downtown Edmonton Community League |publisher=Downtown Edmonton Community League |access-date=October 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Kuban |first =Ron |title =Edmonton's Urban Villages: The Community League Movement |publisher =University of Alberta Press |year =2005 |isbn =9781459303249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Districts and streets==
===Arts District and Churchill Square===
[[File:Churchill square edmonton.jpg|thumb|left|[[Churchill Square, Edmonton|Churchill Square]] is a major [[public square]] in Downtown Edmonton.]]
{{Further information|Churchill Square, Edmonton}}
The arts district is in the eastern part of the core with many award winning institutions like the [[Francis Winspear Centre for Music]] (home of the [[Edmonton Symphony Orchestra]]) and the [[Citadel Theatre]].  [[Edmonton City Hall]] is also located here with all these buildings facing onto Sir Winston Churchill Square. It is also the site of the new [[Art Gallery of Alberta]], which opened in early 2010, and the [[Stanley A. Milner Library]], [[Edmonton Public Library|Edmonton Public Library's]] main branch.

[[Churchill Square, Edmonton|Churchill Square]] (Officially "Sir Winston Churchill Square") is the main downtown square in [[Edmonton]], and is the heart of the Arts District.  The square plays host to a large majority of festivals and events in [[Edmonton Capital Region|Greater Edmonton]].  It is bordered on the north by 102A Avenue, on the west by 100 Street, on the south by 102 Avenue (Harbin Road) and on the east by Rue Hull (99) Street.  Recently, the portion of 102A Avenue that cut Churchill Square off from Edmonton's City Hall has been closed off to vehicular traffic as a way to better connect Churchill Square with the fountains and some festivities on the plaza at City Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2009/12/14/edm-road-closed.html |title=Avenue between City Hall and Churchill Square to close |date=December 14, 2009 |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government Centre ===
[[File:Legislature-Building-Edmonton-Alberta-Canada-02AA.jpg|thumb|The [[Alberta Legislature Building]] is a prominent [[landmark]] in Government Centre.]]
Government Centre is an informal district located at the southwest corner of the downtown core and is the home of the Alberta [[Alberta Legislature|provincial government]]. The most notable feature of this part of downtown is the [[Alberta Legislature Building]] and its surrounding parks, fountains, and gardens.

An underground pedway system connects the Legislature to several of the surrounding buildings, including the historic Bowker Building and the Frederick W. Haultain Building.

Federal government offices were housed in the Federal Building at the north-east corner of Government Centre until they relocated to [[Canada Place (Edmonton)|Canada Place]], located at the east edge of downtown, in the 1980s. The Federal Building is undergoing a $356 million renovation due to be completed in 2015 for provincial government offices and a new underground parking structure.&lt;ref&gt;Archie McLean, "Federal building to get $356M makeover",[http://www2.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=8a5b1566-7738-44ea-a33f-12f855ebc74f Edmonton Journal], June 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infrastructure.alberta.ca/3562.htm |title=The Federal Building and Centennial Plaza Project |author=Government of Alberta Ministry of Infrastructure |publisher=Government of Alberta |accessdate=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transit service is provided by the [[Government Centre Transit Centre]] located near the Federal Building and by [[Grandin station|Grandin LRT Station]] located just to the west.

=== Jasper Avenue ===
{{Main|Jasper Avenue}}
[[File:Jasper ave.JPG|thumb|[[Jasper Avenue]] and 103 Street in Downtown Edmonton. Jasper Avenue is the city's "[[main street]]".]]
Jasper Avenue is the city's "main street". It starts at 77&amp;nbsp;Street in the east, running south west along the south edge of [[Boyle Street]] until it reaches the downtown core. It then runs due west through downtown and the neighbourhood of Oliver until it reaches 125&amp;nbsp;Street. Jasper Avenue is a major public transit route as several of Edmonton's busiest bus routes travel along it. The LRT travels underneath Jasper Avenue between 99 and 110 Streets.

Jasper Avenue has no [[street number]] but sits where 101 Avenue would otherwise be. Jasper Avenue is home to many of [[heritage buildings in Edmonton|Edmonton's oldest heritage buildings]] (for example the [[Hotel Macdonald]]) and some of [[list of tallest buildings in Edmonton|Edmonton's tallest office towers]], including [[Canadian Western Bank Place]] and [[Scotia Place]]; however, the presence of the former limits that of the latter, and many tall buildings are found just off Jasper where land is easier to obtain. Together with help from nearby streets like 100 Avenue, 104 Street, 101 Street, and 102 Avenue, the Jasper West area (west of 97 Street) is one of the major retail, living, commercial, and entertainment districts of the city.

=== Rice Howard Way ===
Rice Howard Way comprises 100A&amp;nbsp;Street between Jasper Avenue and 102 Avenue and 101A&amp;nbsp;Avenue between 100&amp;nbsp;Street and 101&amp;nbsp;Street.  The portion of 101A&amp;nbsp;Avenue between 100A&amp;nbsp;Street and 101&amp;nbsp;Street was closed to traffic, making it an open air pedestrian walkway.  The rest of Rice Howard Way is open to vehicular traffic.  Rice Howard Way has a few prominent office towers like Scotia Place and some restaurants.

Rice Howard Way's southern edge (100A&amp;nbsp;Street at Jasper Avenue) has an entrance to the [[Central station (Edmonton)|Central LRT Station]].

=== Warehouse District and 104 Street ===
[[File:Warehouse District Compessed.jpg|thumb|The Warehouse District is an area in Downtown Edmonton consisting of repurposed warehouses from the early 20th century.]]
The Warehouse District is located between Jasper Avenue and 104&amp;nbsp;Avenue and between 102&amp;nbsp;Street and 109&amp;nbsp;Street.  During the first decade of the 20th century, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] began selling its land holdings in this area, and businesses were quick to move in.  Between 1909 and 1914, no fewer than two dozen warehouses were constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Herzog, "Edmontons Warehouse District",[http://www.rewedmonton.ca/content_view2?CONTENT_ID=447 Real Estate Weekly, Vol 21 No. 25], June 26, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later part of the century, warehouses closed and the buildings were redeveloped into commercial enterprises. In the late 1990s lofts were created in these former warehouses. In recent years, the area has seen a revival, with new lofts and condos being constructed or proposed, along with many designer shops.&lt;ref name="104Street"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/how-104th-street-became-the-heart-of-downtown-edmonton-1.1321099 |title=How 104th Street became the heart of downtown Edmonton |last=Bellefontaine |first=Michelle |date=June 14, 2013 |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The area also included Canada's first urban format Sobey's Fresh Market, flanking the curved Birks building as the entrance to 104 Street at Jasper Avenue, serving the residential population until its closure in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/sobeys-closing-store-on-104th-street-1.2688247 |title=Sobeys closing store on 104th Street |date=June 26, 2014 |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

104 Street (in between Jasper Avenue and 104 Avenue) is the main street in the Warehouse District and features shops, restaurants, cafes and a variety of services. On Saturdays during the warmer months (May–October), the street hosts Edmonton's original farmer's market, the City Market. The area is also known for [[loft]]s in old warehouses. The street is very dense, and has seen new projects completed in 2009 and 2010 ([[Icon Towers|Icon I and II]]) with the construction of the Fox Towers condo complex at the northwest corner of 104&amp;nbsp;Street and 102&amp;nbsp;Avenue underway.&lt;ref name="104Street"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/business/commercial-real-estate/2020+vision+What+will+downtown+Edmonton+look+like+decade/10198815/story.html |title=2020 vision: What will downtown Edmonton look like at the end of the decade? |last=Kent |first=Gordon |date=September 15, 2014 |publisher=Edmonton Journal |accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
[[File:Grant MacEwan North Towers Edmonton Alberta Canada 02.jpg|thumb|[[MacEwan University]]'s City Centre Campus is located at the northern edge of the downtown core. It is one of several [[post-secondary education|post-secondary]] institutions operating in downtown.]]
There are several institutions providing educational opportunities in the downtown core. The largest of these is [[MacEwan University]] whose City Centre Campus is located along the northern edge of the downtown core between 105 Street and 112 Street, and between 104 Avenue and 105 Avenue. This site used to be part of an [[old Canadian National rail yard]] that started redevelopment in the 1990s. MacEwan University also operates the Alberta College Campus located near the southern edge of the downtown core on McDonald Drive.

The [[University of Alberta]] has redeveloped the site of the Bay building on Jasper Avenue between 102 Street and 103 Street as Enterprise Square (2008). "The building will house TEC Edmonton, a jointly operated research commercialization centre presently located in the U of A's Research Transition Facility."&lt;ref&gt;The University [http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=6997 describes its plans] for use of the Bay building in their press release announcing approval to purchase the building.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening of Enterprise Square marks the University's 100th Anniversary and first presence north of the river since it was founded in 1908. Enterprise Square also houses the University's Alumni Services, Faculty of Extension programs, and a U of A Bookstore.

The [[Edmonton Public Schools|Edmonton Public School Board]] operates a high school, Centre High, in the redeveloped Boardwalk and Revolution buildings.

[[NorQuest College]] is located between 107 Street and 108 Street at 102 Avenue and provides upgrading and diploma services.

[[File:McKay Avenue School (front).JPG|thumb|Completed in 1905, [[McKay Avenue School]] is a historical landmark in Downtown Edmonton, and presently houses the [[Edmonton Public School Board]] Archives and Museum.]]
[[McKay Avenue School]] is an important historical building located in downtown Edmonton.  Named for Dr. William Morrison MacKay, a doctor with the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and Alberta's first doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanderson|first=Kay|title=200 Remarkable Alberta Women|year=1999|publisher=Famous Five Foundation|location=Calgary|page=10|url=http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/loc_hist/page.aspx?id=917770}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction began in 1904 when the cornerstone was laid by the [[Governor General of Canada]], [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto|Lord Minto]].  The building was named a provincial historic resource in 1976.  Due to declining enrollments, the school was closed in 1983.  Today, the building has a new lease on life, and is the home of the [[Edmonton Public School Board]] Archives and Museum.  In addition to its educational role, the building was also used by the [[Alberta Legislature]] during 1906 and 1907, when the legislature's first two sittings were held here.  The 1881 Schoolhouse, an older wood frame building and Edmonton's oldest school, is located on the same site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.epsb.net/history.htm History of McKay Avenue School] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213113129/http://archives.epsb.net/history.htm |date=2013-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Retail ==
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
[[Edmonton City Centre]] (formerly Eaton Centre and Edmonton Centre) is a two part shopping mall with over 170 services on 102 Avenue. It is anchored by [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|Hudson's Bay]], [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], [[Winners]] and [[Landmark Cinemas (Canada)|Landmark Cinemas]]. It has four office towers (using the mall as a podium), plus a [[Delta Hotels|Delta Hotel]]. When Edmonton Centre and the Eaton Centre became one in the late 1990s after the demise of Eaton's, a newer and larger pedestrian skyway was built to connect the two malls which also contains a number of shops. Also in the late 1990s (after the malls became one), the mall received a makeover itself. Recently the mall itself has been attracting some higher end retailers.

The '''Dulles Technology Corridor''' is a [[business cluster]] containing many [[Defense contractor|defense]] and technology companies, located in [[Northern Virginia]] near [[Washington Dulles International Airport]].  The area was called "The Silicon Valley of the East" by ''[[Atlantic (magazine)|Atlantic]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/06/the-silicon-valley-of-the-east-is-washington-dc/240055/ | title='The Silicon Valley of the East' Is Washington, D.C. | author=Derek Thompson | work=The Atlantic | date=June 7, 2011 | accessdate=December 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was dubbed the "'''Netplex'''" in a 1993 article by ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine. Another article in 2000 claimed that the area contained "vital electronic pathways that carry more than half of all traffic on the Internet. The region is home to more telecom and satellite companies than any other place on earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Donnelly |first= Sally B. |last2= Zagorin |first2= Adam |date= August 14, 2000 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,997688-1,00.html |title= D.C.

The Dulles Technology Corridor is a descriptive term for a string of communities that lie along and between [[Virginia State Route 267]] (the Dulles Toll Road and Dulles Greenway), and [[Virginia State Route 7]] (Leesburg Pike and Harry Byrd Highway). It especially includes the communities, from east to west, of [[Tysons Corner, Virginia|Tysons Corner]], [[Reston, Virginia|Reston]], [[Herndon, Virginia|Herndon]], [[Sterling, Virginia|Sterling]], and [[Ashburn, Virginia|Ashburn]]. These communities are in [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax]] and [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun]] counties, which are the second-highest and [[Highest-income counties in the United States#100 highest-income counties by median household income|highest income counties]] in the U.S. as of 2011, coinciding with the national technology and local internet boom of the 1990s and local technology spending after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

==Internet infrastructure and data centers==
As of 2009, more than 50% of all U.S. Internet traffic travelled through Northern Virginia.&lt;ref name="us news"/&gt; In 2013, as much as 70% of the world's Internet traffic travelled through data centers in Loudoun County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.loudountimes.com/index.php/news/article/another_joins_data_center_rush123/ | title=Another company joins data center rush | author=Andrew Sharbel | work=Loudoun-Times-Mirror | date=May 29, 2012 | accessdate=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2014}} In his book ''Tubes'', author Andrew Blum calls [[Ashburn, Virginia]]&amp;mdash;a community within the Dulles Technology Corridor&amp;mdash;"the bullseye of America's Internet".&lt;ref name="tubes"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://gizmodo.com/5913934/the-bullseye-of-americas-internet | title=The Bullseye of America’s Internet | author=Andrew Blum | work=Gizmodo | date=Jan 16, 2013 | accessdate=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dulles Technology Corridor serves as headquarters for domain name registrar [[Network Solutions]] and network infrastructure company [[Verisign]]. The region contains the [[Internet Society]], and used to contain the mainframe that houses the master list of all Internet domain names.

The Dulles Technology Corridor includes Ashburn, Virginia's "Data Center Alley",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2011/08/28/washpost-profiles-ashburn-data-center-alley/ | title=WashPost Profiles Ashburn 'Data Center Alley' | author=Rich Miller | work=Data Center Knowledge | date=August 28, 2011 | accessdate=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; described by the ''[[Washington Business Journal]]'' as "an area that is quickly emerging as a national hub for data storage facilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/print-edition/2011/12/02/equinix-plotting-massive-ashburn-data.html | title=Equinix plotting massive Ashburn data complex | work=Washington Business Journal | author=Daniel J.

== Career ==

During his junior year at Harvard, Saverin met fellow Harvard undergraduate, sophomore [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. Noting the lack of a dedicated social networking website for Harvard students, the two worked together to launch The Facebook in 2004. As co-founder, Saverin held the role of [[chief financial officer]] and business manager.&lt;ref name="Accidental Billionaires" /&gt; On May 15, 2012, [[Business Insider]] obtained and released an exclusive email from Zuckerberg detailing how he cut Saverin from Facebook and [[Stock dilution|diluted]] his stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carlson|first1=Nicholas|title=EXCLUSIVE: Here's The Email Zuckerberg Sent To Cut His Cofounder Out Of Facebook  |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/exclusive-heres-the-email-zuckerberg-sent-to-cut-his-cofounder-out-of-facebook-2012-5?IR=T|website=Business Insider|publisher=Business Insider Inc|accessdate=9 February 2016|date=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lawsuit filed by Facebook against Saverin, arguing that the stock-purchase agreements Saverin signed in October 2005 was invalid. Saverin then filed a suit against Zuckerberg alleging Zuckerberg spent Facebook's money (Saverin's money) on personal expenses over the summer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.businessinsider.com/how-mark-zuckerberg-booted-his-co-founder-out-of-the-company-2012-5/?IR=T | title=EXCLUSIVE: How Mark Zuckerberg booted his co-founder out of the company | accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both suits were settled out of court. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed and the company affirmed Saverin's title as co-founder of Facebook. Saverin signed a [[non-disclosure agreement|non-disclosure contract]] after the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carvalho dos Santos|first=Alexandre|author2=Marcelo Rainho|date=October 2009|title=A misteriosa história do brasileiro que fundou o Facebook|journal=[[Superinteressante]]|publisher=[[Editora Abril]]|location=São Paulo|issue=270|pages=94–97|issn=0104-1789|oclc= 60743498|language=Portuguese|trans-title="The mysterious story of the Brazilian who founded Facebook."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10363">'''Employers Group''' was founded as the Merchants and Manufacturers Association in 1896 in California. It has become a worldwide organization advocating for employers and giving guidance about employment laws and regulations, professional development, consulting projects, and compensation and workplace trends surveys.

When founded, the organization's goal was to secure the [[open shop]] in all workplaces in the city.&lt;ref name="Cross"&gt;Cross, ''History of the Labor Movement in California,'' 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foner"&gt;Foner, ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States: The AFL in the Progressive Era, 1910-1915,'' 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milkman, ''L.A Story: Immigrant Workers and the Future of the U.S. Labor Movement,'' 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter half of the 20th century, the organization became a [[human resources]] consulting firm.  In 1993, the Merchants and Manufacturers Association merged with the Federated Group of San Francisco to create the Employers Group.  The organization's current president and chief executive officer is Mark Wilbur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services/4341488-1.htm "Mark Wilbur Named President and CEO at Employers Group," from Business Wire at AllBusiness website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation and early history==
Employers Group was founded in 1893 in Los Angeles as the Merchants Association. Its goal was to promote local products, and manufacturing companies, railroads, shipping companies, department stores, breweries and food markets were some of its charter members. One of its most prominent members was the ''[[Los Angeles Times]].''&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;''The Merchants and Manufacturers Association – Celebrating 90 Years of Service,'' 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deverell"&gt;Deverell, ''Whitewashed Adobe: The Rise of Los Angeles and the Remaking of Its Mexican Past,'' 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The association launched a number of civic projects early in its history.  In 1897, it created the annual Fiesta de las Flores to promote locally produced goods and services.  The festival eventually merged with the [[Tournament of Roses]] Parade in [[Pasadena, California]].&lt;ref name="Deverell" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''America's New Year Celebration: The Rose Parade &amp; Rose Bowl Game,'' 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The open shop battle===
M&amp;M's focus over its first three decades was primarily on industrial relations. The Merchants Association had acted primarily as a promoter of local industry. But when [[Harrison Gray Otis (publisher)|Harrison Gray Otis]], publisher of the ''Los Angeles Times,'' joined the body in 1896, the association underwent a transformation.  It adopted a new name (the Merchants and Manufacturers Association, or M&amp;M), and began vehemently promoting the [[open shop]].&lt;ref&gt;Kazin, ''Barons of Labor: The San Francisco Building Trades and Union Power in the Progressive Era,'' 1987, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The nascent [[labor movement]] in Los Angeles collapsed, and Los Angeles remained largely union-free until the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Cross" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Foner" /&gt;

On October 1, 1910, a bomb exploded at a printing plant owned by the ''Times.'' Twenty-one workers were killed in the fire which followed.  Otis declared the bombing the "Crime of the Century" and used his newspaper's large circulation to whip up public sentiment against unions. A second bombing at an iron works in the city on Christmas Day worsened the hysteria in the city. The M&amp;M contributed $50,000 ($1.1 million in 2007 dollars) to a city effort to hire [[private detective]]s to track down the perpetrators.  In April 1911, [[Ortie McManigal]], a staff representative with the [[International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers|International Association of Bridge and Structural Iron Workers]], was apprehended by private detectives in [[Illinois]]. McManigal confessed to bombing the iron works and implicated the union's national secretary-treasurer, James B. McNamara, and his brother, John J. McNamara, in the ''Times'' bombing.&lt;ref name="Foner" /&gt;

The [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), [[Eugene Debs]] and others rallied to the defense of [[The McNamara Brothers]]. The brothers were defended in court by famed attorney [[Clarence Darrow]]. Darrow was increasingly skeptical of the chance for an acquittal. Darrow attempted to arrange a plea bargain.  The state of California was on the verge of accepting the plea bargain when Darrow was arrested for attempting to bribe a member of the jury. The state rejected the plea.  James McNamara was sentenced to life, and died in [[San Quentin State Prison]] of cancer in 1941.  His brother John McNamara served seven years, and died a few months after his brother of a heart attack in [[Butte, Montana]].&lt;ref name="Foner" /&gt; Darrow was tried for attempted bribery. The first trial ended in a mistrial, the second in a jury deadlock. The state dropped the charges against Darrow.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, ''The People v. Clarence Darrow: The Bribery Trial of America's Greatest Lawyer,'' 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, the Industrial Relations Committee of San Francisco formed to promote the open shop in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. In time, that organization changed its name to the "Federated Employers of the Bay Area" and merged with the M&amp;M in 1993.

==1930s==
In 1937, M&amp;M was joined in the labor relations field by a new organization, Southern Californians, Inc. Sponsored by the ''Los Angeles Times,'' the group was led by [[Paul Shoup]], a retired vice chairman of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]. Southern Californians was founded ostensibly to promote the welfare of Los Angeles, but in testimony before the [[United States Congress]] later that year its leaders admitted that its sole goal was the preservation of the open shop.&lt;ref name="Pichardo"&gt;Pichardo, "The Power Elite and Elite-Driven Countermovements: The Associated Farmers of California During the 1930s," ''Sociological Forum,'' March 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  In less than three years, it had collected more than $523,000 from 12 major Los Angeles companies to fight the city's unions.  Southern Californians spent $48,000 create two other front-groups:  "[[The Neutral Thousands]]" (which claimed 109,000 members but had had only 250; it had copied names out of the telephone book and put them on its "official" membership list) and "Women of the Pacific" (led by a [[Strike action|strikebreaker]] from [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]).&lt;ref name="Pesotta"&gt;Pesotta, ''Bread Upon the Waters,'' 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

M&amp;M and Southern Californians decided the best way to stamp out unions was to remove the unions' most powerful weapons:  The strike and picket line.&lt;ref name="Pichardo" /&gt; M&amp;M quickly established its own front group, the Employers' Advisory Service, to help employers set [[company union]]s.  Both Southern Californians and M&amp;M spent more than $123,000 in 1937 to promote a voter referendum which would outlaw the strike and picket line.&lt;ref name="Pesotta" /&gt;  Their opportunity came when a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] group began digging up dirt on Republican [[Mayor of Los Angeles, California|Mayor]] [[Frank L. Shaw]].  Voters were outraged when a private detective employed by the reform group was nearly killed by a car bomb planted by Shaw's organization. Another Republican, Superior Court Judge [[Fletcher Bowron]], began a recall effort against Shaw. M&amp;M and Southern Californians used the recall election to push through their ordinance.  The new law explicitly outlawed picketing entirely unless a majority of a firm's employees was on strike, made it illegal for anyone except a striking employee to picket a firm, limited pickets to one person per entrance or pickets at least 25 feet apart, prohibited coercion and intimidation by unions, forbade unions to talk to workers at home, and even outlawed unions' use of abusive or foul language. A compromise referendum pushed by the AFL prohibited public disorder and intimidation but not picketing. The voters approved the M&amp;M referendum, turned out Mayor Shaw, and elected Judge Bowron (who had flatly condemned the M&amp;M referendum as blatantly unconstitutional).&lt;ref&gt;"Sun and Shade," ''Time,'' September 26, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

M&amp;M's activities were later exposed before the [[La Follette Committee]] in 1937 and 1938.&lt;ref name="Pesotta" /&gt;

[[Hajji|Hajjah]] '''Fatimah binte Sulaiman''' ({{H:title|Both of these years are estimates|1754? &amp;ndash; 1852?}}), also known as '''Hajjah Fatimah''' and as the '''"Sultana of [[Gowa Regency|Gowa]]"''', was a Singaporean merchant and philanthropist. After the death of her second husband, she combined his business with her own boats and built it into a successful naval trading operation. Fatimah is best known for commissioning the mosque that bears her name, [[Masjid Hajjah Fatimah]]. In recognition for her philanthropy in funding the creation of the mosque, as well as homes for the poor that were adjacent to it, Faimah was inducted into the [[Singapore Women's Hall of Fame]] in 2014.

==Background==
Fatimah binte Sulaiman was born in [[Malacca]], [[Malaysia]], to a family of successful traders. Her year of birth is not certain, but is believed to be 1754. After the collapse of an unsuccessful first marriage, she married Daing Chanda Pulih, a [[Bugis]] prince and merchant from [[South Sulawesi]] (then known as Celebes).&lt;ref name=SI_2003&gt;{{cite web|last1=Azrah|first1=Edian|title=Hajjah Fatimah|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_685_2005-01-12.html|website=Singapore Infopedia|publisher=[[National Library Board]]|accessdate=11 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224114151/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_685_2005-01-12.html|archivedate=24 December 2014|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SWHF_15NOV11&gt;{{cite web|title=Hajjah Fatimah binte Sulaiman|url=http://www.swhf.sg/the-inductees/name/13-community-social-work/126-hajjah-fatimah-binte-sulaiman|website=[[Singapore Women's Hall of Fame]]|publisher=Singapore Council of Women's Organisations|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulih had a trading post in Singapore, and brought Fatimah binte Sulaiman with him to the island.&lt;ref name=CS_12JUNE15&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ho|first1=Joyce|title=Hajjah Fatimah Mosque|url=http://comesingapore.com/travel-guide/article/303/hajjah-fatimah-mosque|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223080123/http://comesingapore.com/travel-guide/article/303/hajjah-fatimah-mosque|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 December 2010|website=ComeSingapore.com|publisher=Travelogy|accessdate=11 November 2015|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulih died while Fatimah was still young, and she combined his business with her own boats and built a successful [[steamship]] and [[sailboat]]-based trading operation.&lt;ref name=TSWHF_15NOV12/&gt;&lt;ref name=NHB_15NOV11&gt;{{cite web|title=Masjid Hajjah Fatimah |url=http://www.nhb.gov.sg/places/trails/kampong-glam/trail-ii/trail-sites/places-of-worship/masjid-hajjah-fatimah |website=[[National Heritage Board (Singapore)|National Heritage Board]] |accessdate=11 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123030110/http://www.nhb.gov.sg/places/trails/kampong-glam/trail-ii/trail-sites/places-of-worship/masjid-hajjah-fatimah |archivedate=23 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before her husband died, Fatimah had a daughter with him, Raja Siti. Raja would go on to marry [[Sayyid Ahmad ibn ‘Abdur-Rahman As-Saqqaf]], whose [[Alsagoff Family|family]] would become known for their philanthropy, like Fatimah herself.&lt;ref name=SI_2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NHB_15NOV11 /&gt;

Fatimah is commonly referred to as "[[Hajji|Hajjah]] Fatimah", indicating that she made the a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], or [[Hajj]].&lt;ref name=NHB_15NOV11 /&gt; The exact date of her death is unknown, but her family claims that Fatimah lived to the age of 98.&lt;ref name="SI_2003" /&gt; She is buried on the grounds of the [[Masjid Hajjah Fatimah]], along with her husband, her daughter and son-in-law's, and several of their descendants.&lt;ref name=SI_2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SWHF_15NOV11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NHB_12NOV15&gt;{{cite web|title=Hajjah Fatimah Mosque |url=http://www.nhb.gov.sg/places/sites-and-monuments/national-monuments/hajjah-fatimah-mosque |website=National Heritage Board |accessdate=12 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122215424/http://www.nhb.gov.sg/places/sites-and-monuments/national-monuments/hajjah-fatimah-mosque |archivedate=22 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Masjid Hajjah Fatimah==

Fatimah's wealth led to her becoming known as the "Sultana of [[Gowa Regency|Gowa]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2962">The '''Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center''' or (FS-ISAC) is the global financial industry's resource for cyber and physical threat intelligence analysis and sharing. FS-ISAC is a member-owned non-profit, created by and for the financial services industry to help assure the resilience and continuity of the global financial services infrastructure and individual firms against acts that could significantly impact the sector’s ability to provide services critical to the orderly function of the global financial system and economy.{{Infobox company

== History ==
FS-ISAC was formed in 1999 in response to the [[Presidential directive|Presidential Decision Directive]] 63, signed by [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] in 1998 which mandated that public and private sectors share information about physical and cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities to help protect the US critical infrastructure via [[Information Sharing and Analysis Center]]s (ISACs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/pdd/pdd-63.htm|title=PRESIDENTIAL DECISION DIRECTIVE/NSC-63|last=|first=|date=|website=FAS|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]] and in response to subsequent federal actions, FS-ISAC expanded its role to encompass physical threats to the financial sector. In recent years FS-ISAC has expanded into a global organization and has played a paramount role in leading several industry initiatives to better protect and serve the global financial services industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theclearinghouse.org/research/banking-perspectives/2017/2017-q2-banking-perspectives/the-value-of-information-sharing|title=The Value of Information Sharing {{!}} The Clearing House|website=www.theclearinghouse.org|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/new-financial-system-analysis-and-resilience-center-formed-/d/d-id/1327276|title=New Financial System Analysis &amp; Resilience Center Formed|work=Dark Reading|access-date=2017-06-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/finance/332757-will-your-bank-be-on-your-side-if-your-account-gets-hacked|title=Will your bank be on your side if it gets hit with a cyberattack?|last=Tan|first=Anjelica|date=2017-05-10|work=TheHill|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cone Manor in fog.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Cone Manor, as seen from Bass Lake, in heavy fog]]
'''Flat Top Manor''', as it is known to the locals, is also referred to as '''Moses Cone Manor''', '''Moses Cone Estate''', the '''Moses H. Cone Mansion''', or just '''Flat Top'''. On the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] it is located at [[Milepost]] 294 in [[Blowing Rock, North Carolina]]. To most people who travel the Parkway it is simply the '''Parkway Craft Center''', which is the major component of the manor house. It is open to the public from spring through fall and gets over 225,000 visitors annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.nps.gov/blri/parkmgmt/upload/Blue-Ridge-Parkway-Centennial-Challenge-Vision-Statement.pdf First Annual Centennial Strategy for August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The mansion was built by [[Moses H. Cone]] and his wife Bertha at the turn of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boonencmagazine.com/mosesconemansion.html?gclid=CLqMq-PH1ZECFQZzHgodCi0VaQ Moses Cone Mansion / Parkway Craft Center]&lt;/ref&gt; Its construction was started in 1899 and finished in 1901. It has twenty-three rooms and {{convert|13000|sqft|m2}} of living space.&lt;ref name="virtualblueridge.com"&gt;[http://www.virtualblueridge.com/parkway_tour/parks/293_0/ Moses H. Cone Memorial Park &amp; Flat Top Manor]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Moses began acquiring land in the 1890s in the Blowing Rock area to build the house, he emulated [[George Washington Vanderbilt II|George Vanderbilt]]’s [[Biltmore Estate]] in [[Asheville, North Carolina]].  Newspaper reporters of the time referred to these builders as "Farmer Cone" and "Farmer Vanderbilt". In 1898 Moses announced he was going to build a mansion in Blowing Rock that cost $25,000 when $200 would buy a habitable home in the area.

==Location==
The mansion is named "Flat Top" manor because of the nearness to Flat Top Mountain,&lt;ref name="virtualblueridge.com"/&gt; which Moses and Bertha also purchased. It is part of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]]. The elevation in this area where the house is built is just at {{convert|4500|ft|m}}, while [[Grandfather Mountain]], which is only a few miles to the south, has an elevation of nearly {{convert|6000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandfather.com/about/ About Grandfather Mountain]&lt;/ref&gt; Moses used his estate to showcase his knowledge of scientific farming. It had extensive orchards, gardens and livestock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mountaintimes.com/mtweekly/2007/0712/symposium.php3 Mountain Times article]&lt;/ref&gt; When the Blue Ridge Parkway came through and the government took over the property several buildings on the land were torn down. These included houses for workers, a building where washing took place, and a single lane bowling alley. The bowling alley was located in a small building that resembled an elongated outhouse. Only men used the bowling alley, they would roll the ball down the lane and have to walk down the lane themselves to retrieve the ball and set the pins back up. To stop the ball a large bear skin hung at on the back wall. The property included several apple orchards including one on a far end of the property called China because "it was on the other side of the world."

The [[Moses H. Cone Memorial Park]] that contains the mansion is located between Milepost 292 and 295. The house is open to the public and there is no charge for admission. The first floor contains a Craft Center operated by the [[Southern Highland Handicraft Guild]]. It also has a [[National Park Service]] information desk and a book store. There are tours given by Park Rangers of the second story of the mansion. A visitor can sit in a [[rocking chair]] on the large [[veranda]] or walk the nearby self-guiding trail to the side of the manor house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blowingrock.org/mosescone.html Moses H. Cone Memorial Park]&lt;/ref&gt; The hike around Bass Lake is the most popular. The Craft Center inside the mansion features a gift shop and a craft-person's workshop where various [[Handicraft|arts and crafts]] (i.e. pottery, wood craving, textiles, painting, drawing, needlepoint, crocheting) are demonstrated often.

==Architecture==
[[File:Cone's Mansion near Blowing Rock, N.C. 1911.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Postcard]] of Flat Top Manor sent from Etta Cone, sister of owner Moses Cone, to her friend [[Gertrude Stein]], 23 July 1911]]
The mansion's architectural style is [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] [[Colonial Revival architecture|Neo-Colonial]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sherpaguides.com/north_carolina/mountains/black_mountains/moses_h_cone_mem_park.html Moses H. Cone Memorial Park]&lt;/ref&gt; and is an example of [[Colonial Revival]] construction of large white columns, leaded glass windows, and dormers on top of the house. At the turn of the twentieth century building the mansion with gaslights, a telephone, and central heating system was not an easy task. Building materials were hauled by horse-drawn wagons from the railhead in [[Lenoir, North Carolina]], a distance of over {{convert|20|mi|km}}. This was the way all the fine [[furnishings]] and decorative items were brought in also to the mansion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueridgeheritage.com/HistoricBlueRidge/HistoricSites/MosesConeManor.html Historic Blue Ridge sites - Moses Cone Manor]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses's sisters, Dr. Claribel and Miss Etta Cone, were art collectors who used some of their family's textile fortune to amass a premier collection of modern art. Their friend [[Gertrude Stein]] once visited Flat Top Manor. The artist [[Henri Matisse]], another friend, was sent apples as a gift from the Cones that came from the estate property.  The Cone Collection, with its extensive collection of Matisse and other works, is today housed in a special wing of the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]].

Flat Top Manor was a filming location for the movie "[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120689/locations The Green Mile - filming locations]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manor is featured as exterior shots in "Mandie and the Secret Tunnel" (2009) starring Dean Jones and Lexi Johnson.

The '''Garment District''', also known as the '''Garment Center''', the '''Fashion District''', or the '''Fashion Center''', is a [[List of Manhattan neighborhoods|neighborhood]] located in the [[borough of Manhattan]] in [[New York City]]. The dense concentration of fashion-related uses give the neighborhood its name. The neighborhood, less than {{convert|1|mi2|km2}}, is generally considered to lie between [[Fifth Avenue]] and [[Ninth Avenue (Manhattan)|Ninth Avenue]], from [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th]] to [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]]s.

The neighborhood is home to many of New York City's showrooms and to numerous major fashion labels, and caters to all aspects of the fashion process from design and production to [[wholesale]] selling. The Garment District has been known since the early 20th century as the center for [[fashion]] manufacturing and [[fashion design]] in the United States, and even the world.&lt;ref name="NYC Fashion Info"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nycfashioninfo.com/getdoc/ca1a7be9-8e34-423f-b4b8-c1c4a7ca3721/the-fashion-capital.aspx |title=The Fashion Capital |work=nycfashioninfo.com |accessdate=2010-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726163331/http://nycfashioninfo.com/getdoc/ca1a7be9-8e34-423f-b4b8-c1c4a7ca3721/the-fashion-capital.aspx |archivedate=2010-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
By the late 1930s, the Garment District was broadly surrounded by Sixth Avenue to the east, 25th Street to the south, Ninth Avenue to the west, and 42nd Street to the north. The southern portion, between 25th and 30th Streets, comprised the Fur District, which conducted a very similar function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/plans/hudson-yards/hy_chap9_t_fgeis_final.pdf|title=No. 7 Subway Extension—Hudson Yards Rezoning and Development Program Final Generic Environmental Impact Statement|chapter=Chapter 9: Architectural Historic Resources|publisher=[[New York City Department of Buildings]]|accessdate=2018-07-24|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern-day Garment District's boundaries may be defined most broadly as the area of Manhattan west of Fifth Avenue, below 42nd Street and as far south as the mid- or upper-20s (including the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] between 26th and 28th Streets from Seventh to Eighth Avenues).&lt;ref&gt;C. J. Hughes, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/realestate/16living.html An Identity Dyed in the Wool], ''New York Times'', Jan. 14, 2011. "Exact boundaries are open to interpretation. A generous definition could have them stretch south to the Fashion Institute of Technology on West 27th Street, or over to Fifth Avenue, which is where the business improvement district puts it." (See also [http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2011/01/16/realestate/16liv-map/16liv-map-popup.jpg map].)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDMVOLtPRI0C&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=New York City For Dummies|author=Brian Silverman|year=2007|publisher=Wiley Publishing, Inc.|quote=To the southwest lies the Fashion or Garment District (roughly between 26th and 42nd streets west of Fifth Avenue), with its array of fabric shops and wholesale fashion stores.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anna Bahney, [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/10/realestate/airy-lofts-in-a-manufacturing-neighborhood.html Living In | The Fashion District | Airy Lofts in a Manufacturing Neighborhood], ''New York Times'', July 10, 2005. "This neighborhood, from the northern reaches of Chelsea up to 42nd Street, between Fifth and 10th Avenues, has slipped out of its functional, if somewhat frumpy, workaday moniker of the garment district into an identity more accessible and prime-time: the fashion district."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LetsGo&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ewr8FJP32jQC&amp;pg=PA189#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Let's Go New York City, 17th ed.|year=2009|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Midtown apparel industry was traditionally concentrated between 28th Street and 38th Street, historically centered around [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] (designated "Fashion Avenue" in 1972 for the portion between 26th St. and 42nd St.).&lt;ref name=LetsGo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGYUAQAAMAAJ|title=Doing Business in New York City|author=Thomas E.

No other city has a comparable concentration of fashion businesses and talent in a single district.&lt;ref name="NYC Fashion Info"/&gt;

[[Image:Fashiondisbooth.JPG|thumb|left|275px|Information booth in Garment District with ''Needle threading a button'' sculpture in the background]]

The Garment District is home to a number of well-known designers, their production facilities, warehouses, showrooms, and suppliers of fabric and materials. Many in the industry allege that this dense concentration of talent, entrepreneurship and supply stores functions like an ecosystem in which each of the parts help sustain the whole.&lt;ref name="Made in Midtown"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://madeinmidtown.org/ |title=Made in Midtown |work=madeinmidtown.org |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major fashion labels such as [[Carolina Herrera (fashion designer)|Carolina Herrera]], [[Oscar de la Renta]], [[Calvin Klein]], [[Donna Karan]], [[Liz Claiborne]], [[Nicole Miller]], and [[Andrew Marc]] have showrooms, production facilities, or support offices located in the Garment District.

While historically known as the center of textile manufacturing, global trends have changed the way the fashion industry in the Garment District functions. Over the last 50 years, New York’s garment manufacturing sector has experienced a steady decline within the City overall and within the Fashion District specifically. This has occurred as a result of domestic manufacturers becoming less competitive in the global marketplace, in addition to the outsourcing of clothes manufacturing to lower-cost foreign markets.

The decline of the manufacturing sector caused manufacturing in the Garment District to go down as well, and in 1987, the New York City government created the Special Garment Center District zoning (SGCD) to help preserve garment manufacturing. The zoning places manufacturing use restrictions on large portions of the district in an effort to keep manufacturing rents affordable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Article XII: Special Purpose Districts / Chapter 1: Special Garment Center District |url=https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/zoning/zoning-text/art12c01.pdf?r=032216 |website=[[Government of New York City|nyc.gov]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the City’s use of zoning as a job retention tool did not achieve its goal, and manufacturing has continued to decline at the same pace after the zoning was enacted as it did before the preservation measures were in place. This issue has been visited and revisited by policy makers, fashion industry representatives, manufacturing and union representatives and owners of property in the district, but the fate of the district remains uncertain.

==Early history==

[[File:Millinery Synagogue jeh.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Millinery District Synagogue]]

New York first assumed its role as the center of the nation's garment industry by producing clothes for slaves working on Southern [[plantations in the American South|plantations]]. It was more efficient for their masters to buy clothes from producers in New York than to have the slaves spend time and labor making the clothing themselves. In addition to supplying clothing for slaves, tailors produced other ready-made garments for sailors and western prospectors during slack periods in their regular business.

Prior to the mid-nineteenth century, the majority of Americans either made their own clothing, or if they were wealthy, purchased "tailor-made" customized clothing. By the 1820s, however, an increasing number of ready-made garments of a higher quality were being produced for a broader market. The production of ready-made clothing, which continued to grow, completed its transformation to an "industrialized" profession with the invention of the sewing machine in the 1850s. The need for thousands of ready-made soldiers' uniforms during the [[American Civil War]] helped the garment industry to expand further. By the end of the 1860s, Americans bought most of their clothing rather than making it themselves.

German and Central European immigrants to America around the mid-19th century arrived on the scene with relevant business experience and skills just as garment production was passing from a proto-industrial phase to a more advanced stage of manufacture. In the early twentieth-century a largely Eastern European immigrant workforce powered the garment trades.  Writing in 1917, Abraham Cahan credited these immigrants with the creation of American style:&lt;ref name="Cadle 2008 p. 143"/&gt;

{{blockquote|Foreigners ourselves, and mostly unable to speak English, we had Americanized the system of providing clothes for the American woman of moderate or humble means.

With an ample supply of cheap labor and a well-established distribution network, New York was prepared to meet the demand. During the 1870s the value of garments produced in New York increased sixfold. By 1880 New York produced more garments than its four closest urban competitors combined, and in 1900 the value and output of the clothing trade was three times that of the city's second largest industry, sugar refining. New York's function as America's culture and fashion center also helped the garment industry by providing constantly changing styles and new demand; in 1910, 70% of the nation's women's clothing and 40% of the men's was produced in the City.

==Decline of the industry==

Cheaper overseas labor and production has dramatically affected the New York industry for decades. This change has forced many designers who once manufactured their lines in the city to shift production overseas, which has in turn affected small cutting and sewing rooms as well as zipper, button and supply stores in the Garment District.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=New York Seeks to Consolidate Its Garment District |first=Charles V. |last=Bagli |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/nyregion/20garment.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 19, 2009 |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Charles Bagli of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote:

{{Quote|Some city officials and industry leaders worry that if manufacturing is wiped out, many of the designers who bring so much luster to New York will leave, along with the city’s claim to be a fashion capital rivaling Paris and Milan. The damage would be undeniable, given that the industry’s two big annual events—Fashion Week in September and February—attract enormous numbers of visitors and generate hundreds of millions of dollars in economic activity.|Charles Bagli, for the ''New York Times''&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;}}

Although the Garment District as well as other fashion districts have been in decline, there are many organizations working hard to keep this district vital. One such organization is the Garment District Alliance, a nonprofit [[business improvement district]] that promotes the area as a strategic business location for fashion and non-fashion related-businesses in order to bring profit into the area.&lt;ref name="garmentdistrictnyc.com.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.garmentdistrictnyc.com/ |title=Garment District Alliance |work=The Garment District Alliance BID |accessdate=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Garment District Alliance organized a Fashion Walk of Fame on 7th Avenue, Arts Festivals, and a Garment District Information Kiosk located on 7th Avenue that provides sourcing information and industry-related services to fashion professionals, students, hobbyists, visitors, and shoppers.&lt;ref name="kiosk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashioncenter.com/about/contact-us/kiosk/ |title=The Fashion Center Information Kiosk |work=Fashion Center Business Improvement District |accessdate=2010-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101131254/http://www.fashioncenter.com/about/contact-us/kiosk/ |archivedate=November 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="walk of fame"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fashioncenter.com/fashion-industry/fashion-attractions/the-walk-of-fame/ |title=Walk of Fame |work=Fashion Center Business Improvement District |accessdate=2010-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720112402/http://www.fashioncenter.com/fashion-industry/fashion-attractions/the-walk-of-fame/ |archivedate=July 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Save the Garment Center]] is a campaign that was created by several members of the fashion industry in an effort to preserve the concentration of fashion industry-related uses in the district. However, as fashion manufacturing declines, many buildings that once housed these large facilities have been converted to office space. Businesses such as accountants, lawyers, public relations and many high-tech companies have moved into the area, and the area is now divided equally between fashion and non-fashion companies.

Between 1990 and 2000, the district's population grew from 2,500 to 10,281.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/10/realestate/airy-lofts-in-a-manufacturing-neighborhood.html|title=Living In / The Fashion District: Airy Lofts in a Manufacturing Neighborhood|author=Anna Bahney|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2005-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He obtained his BA from [[Hamline University]] in 1914, his MA in Mathematics at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1915, and his PhD at the [[University of Illinois]] in 1918. In 1918 he also obtained his Certified Public Accountant license for the State of North Carolina, and  later also for the State of Illinois.&lt;ref name="utexas 1=2015"&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/faculty/council/2000-2001/memorials/SCANNED/newlove.pdf In Memoriam : George Hillis Newlove], at ''utexas.edu.'' Accessed 2015-02-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newlove had started his academic career during his graduate study as instructor in accountancy at the University of Illinois. After graduation he served in the US Navy in World War I. From 1919 to 1923 he was lecturer in accountancy at the University of Washington, and from 1923 to 1928 Associate Professor at Johns Hopkins University.

The [[shipping company]] is an outcome of the development of the [[steamship]]. In former days, when the [[packet ship]] was the mode of conveyance, combinations, such as the well-known Dramatic and [[Black Ball Line (trans-Atlantic packet)|Black Ball lines]], existed but the ships which they ran were not necessarily owned by the organizers of the services. The advent of the steamship changed all that.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Steamship Lines |volume=25 |pages=850–860 |first=Benedict William |last=Ginsburg |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
In 1815 the first steamships began to ply between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] ports of [[Liverpool]] and [[Glasgow]]. In 1826 the ''United Kingdom'', a leviathan steamship, as she was considered at the time of her construction, was built for the [[London]] and Edinburgh trade, steamship facilities in the coasting trade being naturally of much greater relative importance in the days before railways. In 1823 the [[City of Dublin Steam Packet Company]] was inaugurated, though it was not incorporated until ten years later. The year 1824 saw the incorporation of the [[General Steam Navigation Company]], which was intended not only to provide services in British waters, but also to develop trade with the continent. The St George Steam Navigation Company and the [[British and Irish Steam Packet Company]] soon followed. The former was crushed in the keen competition which ensued, but it did a great work in the development of ocean travel. Isolated voyages by vessels fitted with steam engines had been made by the [[Savannah (steamboat)|''Savannah'']] from the United States in 1819, and by the first [[SS Royal William|''Royal William'']] from Canada in 1833, and the desirability of seriously attacking the problem of ocean navigation was apparent to shipping men in the three great British ports of London, Liverpool and Bristol.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Three companies were almost simultaneously organized: the [[British and American Steam Navigation Company]], which made the [[Thames]] its headquarters; the Atlantic Steamship Company of Liverpool and the [[Great Western Steamship Company]] of Bristol. Each company set to work to build a wooden paddle steamer in its own port. The first to be launched was the [[SS Great Western|''Great Western'']], which took the water in the Avon on 19 July 1837. On 14 October following, the ''Liverpool'' was launched by Messrs Humble, Milcrest &amp; Co., in the port from which she was named, and in May 1838 the Thames-built [[SS British Queen|''British Queen'']] was successfully floated. The ''Great Western'' was the first to be made ready for sea.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

== Improvements ==
Constant improvement has been the watchword of the shipowner and the shipbuilder, and every [[decade]] has seen the ships of its predecessor become obsolete. The mixed paddle and screw leviathan, the [[SS Great Eastern|''Great Eastern'']], built in the late 1850s, was so obviously before her time by some fifty years, and was so under-powered for her size, that she may be left out of our reckoning. Thus, to speak roughly, the 1850s saw the iron screw replacing the wooden paddle steamer; the later 1860s brought the compound engine, which effected so great an economy in fuel that the steamship, previously the conveyance of mails and passengers, began to compete with the sailing vessel in the carriage of cargo for long voyages; the 1870s brought better accommodation for the passenger, with the midship saloon, improved state-rooms, and covered access to smoke-rooms and ladies cabins.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The early eighties saw steel replacing iron as the material for shipbuilding and before the close of that decade the introduction of the twin-screw rendered breakdowns at sea more remote than they had previously been, at the same time giving increased safety in another direction, from the fact that the duplication of machinery facilitated further subdivision of hulls. Now the masts of the huge liners in vogue were no longer useful for their primary purposes, and degenerated first into derrick props and finally into mere signal poles, while the introduction of boat decks gave more shelter to the promenades of the passengers and removed the navigators from the distractions of the social side. The provision of train-to-boat facilities at Liverpool and Southampton in the 1890s did away with the inconveniences of the tender and the cab.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The introduction of the turbine engine at the beginning of the 20th century gave further subdivision of machinery and increase of economy, whereby greater speed became possible and comfort was increased by the reduction of vibration.  At the same time the introduction of submarine bell signaling tended to diminish the risk of stranding and collision, whilst wireless telegraphy not only destroyed the isolation of the sea but tended to safety, as was seen by the way in which assistance was called out of the fog when the [[White Star Line]] liner [[SS Republic (1872)|''Republic'']] was sinking as the result of a collision off [[Martha's Vineyard]] (1909).&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Tank steamers were constructed for the carriage of oil in bulk. Many of these ships were adapted not only for the carriage of oil, but also for its consumption in their furnaces in place of coal. The experience of many years has enabled the owners of some of these lines to exhibit a wonderfully low record of loss, the percentage of deaths at sea to numbers carried being small beyond the dreams of, say, the 1870s. A tenth of 1% over a somewhat extended period is not an unprecedented average.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Economic role==
Businesses that produce household goods are categorized as [[Procyclical|Cyclical]] [[Consumer Products]] by the [[Thomson Reuters Business Classification]] and are organized into three sub-categories:
*[[Consumer electronics|Consumer Electronics]],
*[[Home appliance|Appliances]], [[Tool]]s &amp; Housewares, and
*Home Furnishings (such as [[furniture]]).

Household goods are a significant part of a country's economy, with their purchase the topic of magazines such as ''[[Consumer Reports]]'', their relocation handled by [[Moving company|moving companies]], and their disposal or redistribution facilitated by companies like [[Goodwill Industries]], services like [[classified advertising]] and [[Craigslist]], and events such as [[garage sale]]s and [[car boot sale]]s.

Their safety is often regulated by governments,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emsd.gov.hk/emsd/eng/pps/electricity_pub_epsr.shtml Outline of Electrical Products (Safety) Regulation] from a [[Government of Hong Kong]] website &lt;/ref&gt; which also promote and facilitate their import and export.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?r.s=sc&amp;r.l1=1079717544&amp;r.lc=en&amp;r.l3=1078151046&amp;r.l2=1077717231&amp;type=RESOURCES&amp;itemId=1078151097 Household goods, furniture and furnishings] from a [[HM Revenue and Customs]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
From 1988 to 1999 Garibashvili attended the secondary school No. 1 in [[Dedoplistsqaro]]. From 1999 to 2005 Garibashvili studied International Relations at [[Tbilisi State University]] (TSU), where he graduated with a master's degree. He also studied at the [[Pantheon-Sorbonne University]] from 2002 to 2004. Since 2004, he has worked with the multi-billionaire [[Bidzina Ivanishvili]]. He started by working for logistics division of the construction company Burji, owned by Ivanshvili's Cartu Group. He became Director General of Ivanishvili's charity foundation Cartu in 2005, a member of the supervisory board of Ivanishvili's Cartu Bank in 2007 and director of the label Georgian Dream founded by Ivanishvili's pop-star son [[Bera Ivanishvili|Bera]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="netgazeti - biography"&gt;{{cite news|title=ირაკლი ღარიბაშვილის ბიოგრაფია|url=http://netgazeti.ge/2013/11/02/25089/|accessdate=December 23, 2015|agency=Netgazeti.ge|language=Georgian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of the Prime Minister|url=http://gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=202|publisher=Government of Georgia|accessdate=December 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Georgia: Interior Minister Irakli Gharibashvili Proposed as PM|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/67718|accessdate=December 24, 2015|agency=Eurasianet|date=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==

Garibashvili became involved in the politics of Georgia when Ivanishvili founded his political party [[Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia]] in February 2012. Garibashvili was one of the founding members and initially headed the party’s revision committee.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He was included in the party list of [[Member of Parliament|MP]] candidates for the [[Georgian parliamentary election, 2012|October 2012 parliamentary election]]. After the coalition won the 2012 parliamentary election on October 1, Irakli Garibashvili became a party-list representative of the Georgian Dream – Democratic Georgia party in the 2012 convocation of the [[Parliament of Georgia]].&lt;ref name=netgazeti.ge&gt;{{cite web|title=Gharibashvili biography| url=http://www.netgazeti.ge/GE/105/News/25089/| publisher=netgazeti.ge|accessdate=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Minister of Internal Affairs==
After Georgian Dream's victory in the 2012 parliamentary election, Garibashvili was appointed as Minister of Internal Affairs in the cabinet of Prime Minister Ivanishvili on October 25, 2012. Garibashvili, then 30 years old and described by the [[Georgian media]] as "Ivanishvili's right-hand man", became the youngest member of Georgia's new government. Reforming the [[Interior Ministry]], an agency overseeing Georgian police, security and intelligence services, as well as the border guard and [[Coast Guard of Georgia|navy]], was a part of the Georgian Dream's pre-election agenda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=25403 New Interior Minister Names his Deputies].

From 2012 through 2013, the Interior Ministry arrested several high-ranking officials from the previous government, including the former ministers [[Bachana Akhalaia]] and [[Ivane Merabishvili]]. This led to concerns regarding selective justice and political vengeance and drew criticism from the domestic opposition and the international media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=25495 Ivanishvili: Saakashvili's Lobbying 'Will Not Stop Restoring Justice'].

Garibashvili defended the arrests as being in strict accordance with the law and justice and claimed that the rate of minor crime, albeit increased, was not alarming.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131103141522/http://georgiaonline.ge/news/a1/politics/1353376810.php Interior Minister: Recent arrests are fair].

==Prime Minister==
On November 2, 2013, Prime Minister [[Bidzina Ivanishvili]], who had declared his intention to quit the government following the [[Georgian presidential election, 2013|October 2013 presidential election]], named Garibashvili as his successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Garibashvili Named as Next PM|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=26653|accessdate=November 2, 2013|newspaper=Civil Georgia|date=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and [[Cabinet of Irakli Garibashvili|his cabinet]] won in a vote of 93-19&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgia's Parliament Approves New Prime Minister|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/georgias-parliament-approves-prime-minister-20952201|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Parliament of Georgia]] on November 20, 2013. Garibashvili thus occupied the most powerful political office in the country as the [[Constitution of Georgia (country)|constitution]] amendments had transferred power from the president to the prime minister and the government. At heated parliamentary debates with the [[United National Movement (Georgia)|United National Movement]] minority during the vote, Garibashvili promised economic improvement and stressed that Georgia's EU and NATO aspiration would remain his foreign priorities.&lt;ref name="civil-1"/&gt; On November 24, 2013, he was elected chairman of the Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia party, succeeding Ivanishvili.&lt;ref&gt;[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=26721 Ivanishvili: 'I Quit Politics, But Remain Active Citizen'].

===Government initiatives===	
During his tenure the Security and Crisis Management Council was established, as stipulated by the new [[Constitution of Georgia (country)|Constitution of Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pirweli.com.ge/index.php?menuid=8&amp;id=53060|title=pirweli.com.ge|website=pirweli.com.ge|accessdate=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Unified Coordination Center for Crisis Management was created, with technical assistance from the US, the United Kingdom and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;http://1tv.ge/news-view/60326/&lt;/ref&gt; To coordinate the country’s economic policy, Irakli Garibashvili established the Economic Council.&lt;ref&gt;http://newsport.ge/96866-ristvis-sheiqmna-premierministrtan-arsebuli-ekonomikuri-sabcho#.UsDKpNIW3AQ {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216043101/http://newsport.ge/96866-ristvis-sheiqmna-premierministrtan-arsebuli-ekonomikuri-sabcho |date=December 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
The Georgian Government initiated, and the [[European Union]] directly supported, the development of the Human Rights Strategy and Action Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgia Advances in Human Rights|url=http://www.ge.undp.org/content/georgia/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2014/02/13/georgian-government-presents-national-strategy-and-action-plan-on-human-rights.html|website=UNDP in Georgia|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A relevant statement was made by Prime Minister Garibashvili at the Human Rights Conference, on December 4, 2013. The Human Rights Strategy covers seven years and will not depend on the political cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Human Rights Strategy of Georgia|url=http://yourhumanrights.ge/about-us/national-human-rights-strategy-of-georgia/|website=Georgian Government for Your Rights|accessdate=27 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203001730/http://yourhumanrights.ge/about-us/national-human-rights-strategy-of-georgia/|archivedate=February 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
During his tenure, Garibashvili visited the neighboring countries Armenia, Azerbaijan and Turkey, several European nations, the United States, Israel, the People's Republic of China, and participated in several international summits and forums. While relations to Russia improved, there was no state visits to and from Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prime Minister's Visits and Meetings|url=http://gov.ge/index.php?lang_id=ENG&amp;sec_id=40|publisher=Government of Georgia}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Relations to the European Union were a priority, culminating in the EU-Georgia Association Agreement, initiated at the Vilnius summit and signed on June 27, 2014. This association agreement included a deep and comprehensive free trade agreement between Georgia and the European Union and paved the way for the abolition of visa for travel from Georgia to the [[Schengen area]], planned for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU-Georgia relations|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/georgia/index_en.htm|website=European External Action Service|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prime Minister congratulates the Georgian people on EU’s positive conclusion regarding visa liberalization action plan|url=http://commersant.ge/index.php?m=5&amp;news_id=30594&amp;cat_id=7|agency=Commersant.ge|date=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Garibashvili is married to Nunuka Tamazashvili (born 1983), with three sons, Nikoloz (born 2005), Andria (born 2010), Gabriel (born 2015) and one daughter Nino (born 2016). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asset Declaration|url=https://declaration.gov.ge/eng/declaration.php?id=44067|publisher=Government of Georgia|accessdate=December 24, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225052231/https://declaration.gov.ge/eng/declaration.php?id=44067|archivedate=December 25, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Third son born to Georgian PM’s family|url=http://en.trend.az/scaucasus/georgia/2381349.html|accessdate=December 24, 2015|agency=Trend.az}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father-in-law, Tamaz Tamazashvili, is a former police general who was arrested on charges of illegally carrying and keeping weapon and explosives in October 2011. Garibashvili, a member of then-opposition Georgian Dream party, claimed the arrest was politically motivated. After the Georgian Dream acceded to power in October 2012, Tamazashvili was released from prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Political Motives of General Tamaz Tamazashvili's Imprisonment Was Doubtlessly Proved"|url=http://www.humanrights.ge/index.php?a=main&amp;pid=16968&amp;lang=eng|accessdate=November 20, 2013|newspaper=Humanrights.ge|date=August 16, 2013|agency=PirWeli Information Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Berry McFerrin''' (1807&amp;ndash;1887) was an American [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South|Methodist]] preacher and editor. He served as a chaplain in the [[Confederate States Army]] during the [[American Civil War]].

==Early life==
John Berry McFerrin was born on July 15, 1807 in [[Rutherford County, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="williamspeer"&gt;William S. Speer, ''Sketches of Prominent Tennesseans: Containing Biographies and Records of Many of the Families who Have Attained Prominence in Tennessee'', Genealogical Publishing Com, 2010, pp. 359&amp;ndash;361 [https://books.google.com/books?id=UsVGPmfzJRYC&amp;dq=%22John+B.+McFerrin%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal great-grandfather, William McFerrin, Sr., emigrated to [[York County, Pennsylvania]] from Ireland in 1730.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt; His paternal grandfather, William McFerrin, Jr., served in the [[American Revolutionary War]] of 1775-1783, including at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]] in 1780.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt; His maternal great-grandfather, James Laughlin, emigrated to the United States from [[Belfast]].&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt; His father, James McFerrin, was born in [[Washington County, Virginia]] and served as a Methodist pastor in [[Bellefonte, Alabama]].&lt;ref name="ansonwest"&gt;Anson West, ''A History of Methodism in Alabama'', Nashville, Tennessee: Publishing House of the M.E. South, 1803, pp. 195-196 [https://books.google.com/books?id=3zbTAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA196]&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Jane Campbell Berry, was also born in Washington County, Virginia.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt;

McFerrin grew up on a farm.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt;

==Career==
McFerrin started preaching in 1825 and became an ordained Methodist preacher in 1829.&lt;ref name="ansonwest"/&gt; He delivered his first sermon in [[Tuscumbia, Alabama]]&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt; His other sermons were delivered in [[Franklin County, Alabama]], [[Lawrence County, Alabama]] and [[Limestone County, Alabama]].&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt; He then served as a missionary, converting Native Americans to Christianity.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="christopherhowen"&gt;Christopher H. Owen, ''The Sacred Flame of Love: Methodism and Society in Nineteenth-century Georgia'', Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press, 1998, p. 109 [https://books.google.com/books?id=GtcQAMeVw7IC&amp;pg=PA109]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he preached in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], [[Pulaski, Tennessee]], and in [[Nashville]], Tennessee.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt; He then became a presiding elder in [[Florence, Alabama]] and in [[Cumberland County, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt; He became the pastor at [[McKendree United Methodist Church]] in Nashville.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Thurston Tipps, ''A History of McKendree Church'', Nashville, Tennessee: Parthenon Press, 1984 p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1830s, he was one of the leaders of the [[Temperance movement in the United States|temperance movement]] in Tennessee.&lt;ref name="joecoker"&gt;Joe Coker, ''Liquor in the Land of the Lost Cause: Southern White Evangelicals and the Prohibition Movement'', Louisville, Kentucky: University Press of Kentucky, 2007, p. 26 [https://books.google.com/books?id=SGVZuyHe1r0C&amp;pg=PA26]&lt;/ref&gt; When President [[James K. Polk]] (1795-1849) became ill, he converted him from Presbyterian to Methodist.&lt;ref name="joecoker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="john"&gt;John McCollister, ''God and the Oval Office: The Religious Faith of Our 43 Presidents'', Nashville, Tennessee: Thomas Nelson, 2005 [https://books.google.com/books?id=MkOErWeC1G4C&amp;pg=PT48]&lt;/ref&gt; He later conducted his funeral service. He also converted [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]] (1790–1866), who served as the [[Principal Chiefs of the Cherokee|Principal Chief]] of the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]] from 1828 to 1866.&lt;ref&gt;Gary E. Moulton, ''John Ross, Cherokee Chief'', Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press, 1978, p. 107 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-rXWgUGRvbQC&amp;pg=PA7]&lt;/ref&gt;

McFerrin was one of the early founders of La Grange College in Alabama, later known as the [[University of North Alabama]] in Florence, Alabama.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt; As a result, he was honored by La Grange College with an honorary Doctorate in 1847.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt; He also received an honorary Doctorate from [[Randolph–Macon College]] in [[Ashland, Virginia]], also in 1847.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt;

During the [[American Civil War]] of 1861 to 1865, McFerrin served as a Methodist chaplain in the [[Confederate States Army]], converting soldiers to the Methodist Church.&lt;ref name="christopherhowen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kidnapping"&gt;[http://tn.gov/tsla/cwsb/1863-06-Article-120-Page165.pdf Kidnapping Slaves]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, he served in the [[Second Corps, Army of Tennessee|Second Corps]] of the Confederate [[Army of Tennessee]], under General [[Joseph E. Johnston]] (1807–1891).&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brinsfield"&gt;John Wesley Brinsfield, ''The Spirit Divided: Memoirs of Civil War Chaplains: the Confederacy'', Macon, Georgia: Mercer University Press, 2006, pp. 245-246 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xk4ykJ4Lr1sC&amp;pg=PA245]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, he was a proponent of the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] of African-Americans in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Larry E. Tise, ''Proslavery: A History of the Defense of Slavery in America, 1701-1840'', Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press, 1990, p. 415 [https://books.google.com/books?id=JvWA08GsAAwC&amp;pg=PA415]&lt;/ref&gt; However, his religious service during the war was not without controversy. In a letter to Governor [[Andrew Johnson]] (1808–1875) on April 22, 1862, Presbyterian lawyer [[Adrian Van Sinderen Lindsley]] (1814-1885) blamed him for encouraging secessionist activities in Nashville, as opposed to more moderate Methodists like Reverend [[Holland Nimmons McTyeire]] (1824–1889), Reverend [[John B. Somers]] (1801-1876), Reverend [[James L. Houston]] (1806-1888) and [[Alexander Little Page Green]] (1806-1874).&lt;ref name="thepapers"&gt;Andrew Johnson, ''The Papers: 1822-1851'', Knoxville, Tennessee: University of Tennessee Press, Volume 5, p. 320 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-pWn6WXtgiwC&amp;pg=PA320]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also accused of trying to kidnap freed slaves, in an attempt to retrieve his lost slaves.&lt;ref name="kidnapping"/&gt; He eventually surrendered, as the Confederate cause was lost.&lt;ref name="brinsfield"/&gt; His estate was ruined by 1865.&lt;ref name="kidnapping"/&gt;

McFerrin was a prolific editor of Methodist publications. He served as the editor of the ''[[Nashville Christian Advocate|Southwestern Christian Advocate]]'' from 1840 to 1844 and the ''Christian Advocate'' from 1855 to 1858.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brinsfield"/&gt; Shortly after the war, from 1869 to 1873, he edited the three-volume ''History of Methodism in Tennessee''.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt; He went on to serve as the manager of the Methodist Publishing House from 1878 to 1887.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Fisher, ''They Rode with Forrest and Wheeler: A Chronicle of Five Tennessee Brothers' Service in the Confederate Western Cavalry'', Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland &amp; Company, 1995, p. 83 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mrZPp4gJOPcC&amp;pg=PA83]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1881, McFerrin attended an Ecumenical Conference in London, England as a delegate of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt; During that trip, he conducted services not only in London, but also in Edinburgh, Dublin, Paris and Newcastle.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt;

==Personal life==
McFerrin was married twice.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt;

McFerrin married A. A. Probart of Nashville, daughter of William Y. Probart and Sarah Probart, on September 18, 1833.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt; They had five children:
*Sarah Jane McFerrin.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt;
*James William McFerrin.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt;
*John A. McFerrin.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt;
*Elizabeth Johnston McFerrin.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt;
*Almira Probart McFerrin.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt;
She died in May 1854.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt;

McFerrin remarried, to Cynthia T. McGavock of Nashville, daughter of [[John McGavock]] and Elizabeth McGavock.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt; They had three children:
*Kitty Lou McFerrin.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt;
*Mary McGinty McFerrin.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt;
*Elizabeth McGavock McFerrin.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt;

McFerrin was also a second cousin of James McFerrin Berry, father of [[James Henderson Berry]] (1841-1913), the 14th Governor of Arkansas, and to B.H. Berry, father of [[Campbell Polson Berry]] (1834-1901), a Congressman from California.&lt;ref name="williamspeer"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
McFerrin died in 1887 in [[Davidson County, Tennessee]].

The neighborhood of ''McFerrin Park'', together with the public park called ''McFerrin Park'', both located in Northeastern Nashville, are named in his honor.&lt;ref name="nashvilleand"&gt;Christine Kreyling, [http://www.sitemason.com/files/lHsgSI/PON_Neighborhoods_Northeast.pdf Nashville and Its Neighborhood: Fanning the Flames of Place]&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed on the farmland formerly owned by him.&lt;ref name="nashvilleand"/&gt;

'''Jorien van den Herik''' (born 11 November 1943 in [[Sliedrecht]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] business man and was [[chairman]] of [[Feyenoord Rotterdam]] till 2006.

Van den Herik helped Feyenoord to purchase some players in 1984 as chairman of the "Friends of Feyenoord Group". In a few years time he had invested 3 million [[Dutch gulden]]s in the club. In 1989 be became president of the [[Feijenoord Stadion|Stadion Feyenoord NV]]. When Feyenoord almost was bankrupt due to their sponsor [[HCS Technologies|HCS]], Van den Herik claimed his position in the Feyenoord board by saying "If I lose my money, I would like to be there myself".{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} In 1992, he became Feyenoord's chairman by taking over from {{Interlanguage link multi|Amandus Lundqvist|nl}}.

In 1998 the Fiscal Intelligence and Investigation Service ([[FIOD-ECD|FIOD]]) visited Feyenoord because of suspected fraud.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Mainly based on the signings of [[Aurelio Vidmar]], [[Christian Gyan]] and [[Patrick Allotey]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} This became a continuous subject in the years to come with Van den Herik as the main suspect.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} After several visits in court Van den Herik and Feyenoord were found to be not guilty in 2002.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The Attorney General however appealed, but in 2005, after three years of investigations the results stayed the same.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} They still did not give up and went into cassation.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} On 19 December 2006 Van den Herik and Feyenoord came out of court as the winners again and this time it was the final decision.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Van den Herik has already said he will take the Attorney General to court to reclaim the damage his personality has received in all these years.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The 2005/06 season ended in deception for Feyenoord.{{clarify|date=January 2012}} The team was challenging the Dutch Championship for most of the season, but eventually lost it to [[PSV Eindhoven]]. The newly born Dutch play-offs (held for the first time that year) then became fatal for Feyenoord. [[Ajax Amsterdam]] which ended on a fair distance in the regular league was Feyenoord's opponent in the play-offs and overclassed them and Feyenoord was eliminated for winning an [[UEFA Champions League]] ticket. During the summer break Feyenoord had to sell two of their key players, [[Salomon Kalou]] and the very popular [[Dirk Kuyt]]. Only a small amount of the money became available to invest in new players.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} When [[Angelos Charisteas]] was signed from arch rivals Ajax to replace Dirk Kuyt hundreds of die-hard fans moved to the Feyenoord board to force Van den Herik to resign. Van den Herik stayed at the team and did not want to give up his position, unless the growing pressure, the underperforming of the team and several other problems that had not been solved yet.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} In the meanwhile Feyenoord was placed under special guardianship because of their financial problems.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} A group of some Feyenoord icons, with former chairman [[Gerard Kerkum]] as their leader, operated under the name of "Commissie Kerkum" to restructure Feyenoord's future. In December 2006 they published their thoughts and came to the conclusion that Van den Herik should leave the club. Still Van den Herik did not want to leave, however after hooligan incidents in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] and the growing pressure he announced his retirement in mid December. Van den Herik himself said not the thoughts of the Commissie Kerkum were the key factor for his decision, but the upcoming final result in the fraud case was. After the case was finished in December 2006 - Van den Herik was acquitted - he stepped down.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In the summer transfer window of 2007, Feyenoord surprised friend and foe with the signing of big names like Roy Makaay and Giovanni van Bronckhorst. According to player manager Rob Jansen, Van den Herik played an important role in the realization of the transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Chris van Nijnatten |year=2006 |url=http://www.ad.nl/sport/article1473578.ece |title=Het succes van Feyenoord |publisher= Ad.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''KMW+Nexter Defense Systems''' ('''KNDS''') is a European defence industry holding company, which is result for merger between [[Krauss-Maffei Wegmann]] and [[Nexter Systems]] under KANT project.

==KANT project==
The KANT project is [[joint venture]] completed  by the [[Germany|German]] family-controlled defence company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and [[France|French]] government-owned [[weapons manufacturer|armoured platform manufacturer]] Nexter Systems.  The merger was completed 15 December 2015.  The joint holding company is based in [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]].  KANT is an acronym of "KMW And Nexter Together."&lt;ref&gt;[http://defense-update.com/20151215_kant.html KMW, Nexter Merger Completed]. defense-update.com.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12995">'''Land administration''' is the way in which the rules of [[land tenure]] are applied and made operational. Land administration, whether formal or informal, comprises an extensive range of systems and processes to administer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/Y4307E/y4307e05.htm#bm05.2 Land Tenure and Rural Development, FAO Land Tenure Studies, No 3, Rome, 2002. - 3.16 Land administration]&lt;/ref&gt; The processes of land administration include the transfer of rights in land from one party to another through sale, lease, loan, gift and inheritance; the regulating of land and property development; the use and conservation of the land; the gathering of revenues from the land through sales, leasing, and taxation; and the resolving of conflicts concerning the ownership and the use of land. Land administration functions may be divided into four components: Juridical, regulatory, fiscal, and information management. These functions of land administration may be organized in terms of agencies responsible for [[National mapping agency|surveying and mapping]], [[land registration]], and [[Land valuation#Governing authorities and professional organizations|land valuation]].&lt;ref&gt;Dale &amp; McLaughlin (1999) Land Administration. Oxford University Press, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose and scope of this knowledge domain appear from the following introducing notes:
:These Guidelines define land administration as the process whereby land and the information about land may be effectively managed. They are mainly written for senior governmental staff and politicians engaged in land administration issues. The aim is to outline the benefit of having a relevant and reliable land information system in place. The Guidelines identify the factors that should be taken into account in developing the legislation, organization, databases and maps, as well as the funding mechanisms, required to implement and maintain a solid land administration system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unece.org/index.php?id=25632 |title=Land Administration Guidelines With Special Reference to Countries in Transition |publisher=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe |date=December 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of use of the notion of land administration is a 1973 ''Seminar on Land Administration'' in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;Dale &amp; McLaughlin (1988) Land Information Management. - An introduction with special reference to cadastral problems in Third World countries. Clarendon Press, Oxford, p. 18, note 17&lt;/ref&gt; ''Land administration arrangements'' were charted in a 1985 paper by Holstein, McLaughlin, and Nichols,&lt;ref&gt;Dale &amp; McLaughlin (1988) p. 18, note 10&lt;/ref&gt; and the Department of Lands and Surveys, Western Australia changed name in 1986 to Department of Land Administration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Department of Lands and Surveys, Western Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The UNECE in 1996 published ''Land Administration Guidelines With Special Reference to Countries in Transition'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/index.php?id=25632 Land Administration Guidelines With Special Reference to Countries in Transition. December 1996.] {{ISBN|92-1-116644-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Dale &amp; McLaughlin textbook on ''Land Information Management'' from 1988 was in 1999 succeeded by the textbook ''Land Administration''.

== History ==

The practise of land administration is older than the presently used term. In ''The Cadastral Map in the Service of the State'', mention is made of [[Cadastre|cadastral survey]] and subsequent tax collection in northern part of the Netherlands, initiated by an order  in 1533.&lt;ref&gt;Roger J P Kain &amp; Elizabeth Baigent (1992) The Cadastral Map in the Service of the State - A history of property mapping. The University of Chicago press. p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Other early, seventeenth century mapping for administrative purposes are found, e.g. in Sweden and in German [[Principality|principalities]]. In the duchy of Austrian Lombardy, a complete cadastral survey, the Milan cadaster, was finally adopted as a taxation base in 1760, and this provided the model for continental European countries to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Kain &amp; Baigent (1992), p. 184-185&lt;/ref&gt; Largely independent from this cadastral development, local courts recorded [[Deed#Deeds of conveyance|deeds of conveyance]]. In the context of [[Codification (law)|codification]] of national legislation, most European countries in the nineteenth century established a [[Torrens title|title system]] at the local courts. England and Wales departed from this trend, as prolonged debates during the nineteenth century left parties with optional public recording of deeds of conveyance and the locating of properties and their boundaries on large-scale topographic maps, where available, similar to the [[metes and bounds]] method.&lt;ref&gt;Kain &amp; Baigent (1992), p. 256, 275&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of [[British Raj|British India]] was covered, during the nineteenth century, by the Revenue Survey.&lt;ref&gt;Kain &amp; Baigent (1992), p. 325 f&lt;/ref&gt;

In the colony (now state) of South Australia, [[Robert Torrens]] in 1858 introduced a title system. Like the Milan cadastre, this system became a model to be followed, initially within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. In the USA, the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] established the basis for the [[Public Land Survey System]], which provides locational functions as the cadastral or - in modern terms - [[land information system]] described above. For the present adoption of the Torrens system in the USA, see Justin T. Holl, Jr. et al. (2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://grm.thomsonreuters.com/our-knowledge/2011/07/2011/12/2011/12/white-paper-the-earthen-vessel-land-records-in-the-united-states.aspx Justin T.

== International organizations ==
The domain of '''land administration''' is characterized by the engagement of [[international organization]]s as much as by its intrinsic, multi-disciplinary structure. Among [[intergovernmental organization]]s,
* The [[World Bank]] has supported land and real estate reforms across a wide range of countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.worldbank.org/A6S3NQ9PZ0 Galal, A; Razzaz, Omar (2001) Reforming land and real estate markets. WPS2616.]&lt;/ref&gt; Its Agriculture and Rural Development research program includes the development of the Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF)&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.worldbank.org/4ROUS8GZG0 Land Governance Assessment Framework (LGAF)]&lt;/ref&gt; and the issuing of Policy Research Reports like ''Land Policies for Growth and Poverty Reduction (2003)''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.worldbank.org/NTEKMMPRP0 Policy Research Report: Land Policies for Growth and Poverty Reduction (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the World Bank Group offer a yearly study of conditions for private sector development, including a rating of the ease of ''Registering property''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/registering-property Registering Property]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[UN-HABITAT]]'s section on Land, Tenure &amp; Property Administration focus on the implementation of land, housing and property rights, particularly women's secure tenure, affordable land management systems and pro-poor flexible types of tenure. The insufficient attention paid to the development of methods for implementing land policies, led to the development of pro poor land tools that are affordable and accessible for use by a variety of stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?typeid=19&amp;catid=283&amp;cid=1504 UN-HABITAT, Land &amp; Housing, Research &amp; Tool Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119072839/http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?typeid=19&amp;catid=283&amp;cid=1504 |date=2012-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts further include the creation of the Global Land Tool Network (GLTN).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gltn.net/ The Global Land Tool Network (GLTN)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[FAO]] focuses on [[land tenure]] in the rural domain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/lt-home/en/?no_cache=1 Access and Tenure of Natural Resources]&lt;/ref&gt; and has among others issued a ''Multilingual thesaurus on land tenure''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/sd/2003/in0602_en.htm Multilingual land tenure thesaurus]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[European Commission]] through its [[EuropeAid|Development and Cooperation - EuropeAid]] supports agriculture and rural development,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/what/rural-development/index_en.htm European Commission &gt; EuropeAid &gt; ..Agriculture &amp; rural development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231151036/http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/what/rural-development/index_en.htm |date=2011-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including a more secure access to land &lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/development/icenter/repository/EU_Land_Guidelines_Final_12_2004_en.pdf EU Land Guidelines, 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026161609/http://ec.europa.eu/development/icenter/repository/EU_Land_Guidelines_Final_12_2004_en.pdf |date=2011-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

International professional associations include
* The [[International Federation of Surveyors]] with its 10 commissions, including ''7. Cadastre and Land Management'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fig.net/comm/comindex.htm FIG Commissions]&lt;/ref&gt; and the repository of pertinent articles, OICRF&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oicrf.org/ Office International du Cadastre et du Régime Foncier (OICRF)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Commonwealth Association of Surveying and Land Economy (CASLE), with its international journal ''Survey Review''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casle.org/ The Commonwealth Association of Surveying and Land Economy]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The International Union of [[Civil law notary|Notaries]], which issues the international journal ''Notarius International''&lt;ref&gt;[http://uinl.net/publicaciones.asp?idioma=ing&amp;submenu=NOTARIUS The International Union of Notaries (U.I.N.L.), Notarius International]&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of partners in the ''Global Land Tool Network'' refers to more international organisations, [[NGO]]s, research institutions, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gltn.net/images/stories/list_of_partners-as_of_june11.pdf Global Land Tool Network, Partner list, June 2011]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet''' (21 August 1906 – 11 April 1996) was a French advertising magnate best known as the founder of [[Publicis Groupe]]. Bleustein-Blanchet also invented radio advertising in France, helped create the first French opinion polls, introduced [[Édith Piaf]] to the French public, and fought with the [[Free French]] forces during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/13/world/marcel-bleustein-blanchet-dies-paris-advertising-giant-was-89.html Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet Dies; Paris Advertising Giant Was 89]. ''The New York Times'' (13 April 1996). Retrieved 17 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-marcel-bleusteinblanchet-1304631.html Obituaries: Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet – People, News]. ''The Independent''. Retrieved 17 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The son of Abraham Bleustein, a Russian-Jewish furniture salesman in northern Paris, Marcel Bleustein left school at the age of 14 to help out in the family furniture business. He founded Publicis in 1926 in a small apartment above a butcher's shop. In 1935, he purchased Radio LL from the radio manufacturer [[Lucien Lévy]].
He renamed it Radio Cité, and introduced France's first news broadcasts as well as its first radio jingles. Radio Cité also helped launch singer [[Édith Piaf]].

In 1939, Marcel Bleustein married Sophie Vaillant, an English teacher who was the granddaughter of [[Edouard Vaillant]], a well-known 19th century Socialist politician. They had three daughters, including [[Elisabeth Badinter]], a prominent feminist writer and philosopher who chairs the supervisory board of Publicis Groupe. When the Second World War broke out, Marcel Bleustein's companies were confiscated by the German occupation forces as "Jewish properties". He joined the Resistance, took the code-name Blanchet, and was detached to serve as a co-pilot for the US [[Eighth Air Force]], flying bombing missions over France and Holland. When the war ended, he rebuilt Publicis from scratch, introducing the first opinion polls in France and developing the then-American fields of consumer research and brand analysis. [http://2.262.00515.X]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} He retained his Resistance name of Blanchet, adding it legally to his original name. After the war, Mr. Bleustein-Blanchet reopened Publicis and, calling them on the phone himself, rapidly regained old and new clients, notably Shell, Colgate-Palmolive, L'oreal, Renault, Dim and many others. In 1957 he opened the first "Publicis Drugstore" on the ground level of Publicis' headquarters, 133 avenue des Champs Elysées, former location of the Astoria hotel. The "Drugstore" was a huge success and immediately became the rendez vous point of the cool parisian youth. 
 
During the 1970s, under the leadership of Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet and his successor, [[Maurice Lévy (Publicis)|Maurice Lévy]], Publicis became an international communications group and is now the third largest communications group in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adage.com/article/global-news/publicis-quarter-organic-revenue-growth-7-1/145176/ Publicis' Second-Quarter Organic Revenue Growth Is 7.1%]. ''Advertising Age'' (29 July 2010). Retrieved 17 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, twelve years after his death, the [[American Advertising Federation]] announced that Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet would become the first non-American to be named to the [[Advertising Hall of Fame]].

During his teenager, Martua traded [[fish]], when grown up he started his business as a [[palm oil]] and [[mesocarp]] trader.

==Career==

===Wilmar International===

Martua along with [[Kuok Khoon Hong]], the nephew of Malaysia's richest tycoon [[Robert Kuok]], founded [[Wilmar International]] Limited and by 1991 he owned 7.100 hectare of [[palm tree]] plantations, and also build his own palm oil refinery in North Sumatra. The [[Wilmar International]] business has grown rapidly; by 2013 Wilmar owns more than 50 other companies with 300 manufacturing plants around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dari batak jadi terkaya di dunia|url= http://bisnis.vivanews.com/news/read/39874-dari_batak_jadi_terkaya_di_dunia|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martua also owns London skycraper [[Aviva Tower]] and a hospital in Medan, [[Murni Teguh Memorial Hospital]], which is named after Martua's mother, Murni Teguh. The hospital was launched on 12 December 2012 (12/12/2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Murni Teguh Memorial Hospital|url=http://www.rsmurniteguh.com/index.php/profile|accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Sitorus also formed a partnership with [[Roys Poyiadjis]] to create the largest biofuel power plant in Japan. The plant’s 20 year feed-in tariff is valued at $1.5 billion US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Von Mayer, Wintress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34123">{{for|the documentary|Miss Representation}}
A concept of [[English law]], a '''misrepresentation'''  is an untrue or misleading&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[Royal Mail Case|R v Kylsant]]'' [1931]&lt;/ref&gt;  statement of fact made during negotiations by one party to another, the statement  then inducing that other party into the contract.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Curtis v Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co]]''[1951] Ms Curtis took a wedding dress with beads and sequins to the cleaners. They gave her a contract to sign and she asked the assistant what it was. The assistant said it merely covered risk to the beads, but in fact the contract exempted all liability. The dress was stained but the exclusion was ineffective because of the assistant's misrepresentation, and the claim was allowed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Curtis v Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co]]'' [1951] 1 KB 805&lt;/ref&gt; The misled party may normally [[Rescission (contract law)|rescind]] the contract, and sometimes may be awarded damages as well (or instead of rescission).

The law of misrepresentation is an amalgam of contract and tort; and its sources are [[common law]], [[Equity (law)|equity]] and [[statute]]. The common law was amended by the [[Misrepresentation Act 1967]]. The general principle of misrepresentation has been adopted by the USA and various Commonwealth countries.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Misrepresentation in India]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation and contract terms==
A "representation" is a pre-contractual statement made during negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;For the purposes of "offer and acceptance", a representation may serve a further function such as an "offer", "counter-offer", "invitation to treat", "request for information" or "statement of intention"&lt;/ref&gt; If a representation has been incorporated into the contract as a [[Contractual term|term]],&lt;ref&gt;A contractual term may be a [[warranty]], [[Contractual term#Condition or Warranty|condition]] or innominate term.&lt;/ref&gt; then the normal remedies for [[breach of contract]] apply. Factors that determine whether or not a representation has become a term include:
* The relative expertise of the parties.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oscar Chess v Williams (1957) ]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dick Bentley v Harold Smith Motors ]]'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The reliance that one party has shown on the statement.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bannerman v White]]'' (1861).&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The reassurances given by the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Schawel v Reade]]'' (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The customary norms of the trade in question.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ecay v Godfrey]]'' (1947)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The representation forms the basis of a [[collateral contract]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Andrews v Hopkinson]]'' (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shanklin Pier v Detel Products]]'' (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Evans v Andrea Merzario]]'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Heilbut, Symons &amp; Co. v Buckleton]]'' [1913] A.C. 30 HL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer'' [1919]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|64|1919|ltigants=Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer |parallecite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1919/64.pdf (1919) 27 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 133 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Otherwise, an action may lie in misrepresentation, and perhaps in the torts of [[negligence]] and [[deceit]] also.  Although a suit for breach of contract is relatively straightforward, there are advantages in bringing a parallel suit in misrepresentation, because whereas repudiation is available only for breach of condition&lt;ref&gt;A "condition" is a term whose breach denies the main benefit of the contract to the claimant.&lt;/ref&gt; only, rescission is ''[[prima facie]]'' available for all misreps, subject to the provisions of s.2 of the [[Misrepresentation Act 1967]], and subject to the inherent limitations of an equitable remedy.&lt;ref&gt;"Inherent limitations": equitable remedies are only ever discretionary; and one must "come to equity with clean hands".&lt;/ref&gt;

== No general duty of disclosure==
There is no general duty of disclosure in English contract law, and one is normally not obliged to say anything.&lt;ref&gt;However, [[EU Law]] has introduced a "right of reasonable expectation". - ''[[Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentacion SA|Marleasing]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Ordinary contracts do not require "good faith" as such,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mayerbrown.com/files/Publication/92d74f21-c4e3-4d1d-86ac-77fa21b6c95c/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/65ac405d-db68-4d53-bdfa-8434e78cf627/Good_Faith_jul2013_corp-alert.pdf "Good faith in English contract law?"]&lt;/ref&gt; and mere compliance with the law is sufficient. However in particular relationships silence may form the basis of an actionable misrepresentation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|64|1984|litigants= [[Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corp]] |parallelcite=(1984) 156 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 41 at [68]|courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[Davies v. London &amp; Provincial Marine Insurance Co]]'' (1878) 8 Ch. D. 469, 474. Justice Fry commented on the responsibilities of a fiduciary "...they can only contract after the most ample disclosure of everything..."&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Agency (law)|Agents]] have a [[fiduciary|fiduciary relationship]] with their principal. They must make proper disclosure and must not make secret profits.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lowther v Lord Lowther]]'' (1806) 13 Ves Jr 95, the plaintiff handed over a picture to an agent for sale. The agent knew of the picture's true worth yet bought it for a considerably lower price. The plaintiff subsequently discovered the picture's true worth and sued to rescind the contract. It was held that the defendant was in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiff and accordingly assumed an obligation to disclose all material facts. Accordingly, the contract could be rescinded.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Employers and employees have a ''[[Ex fida bona|bona fide]]'' duty to each other once a [[contract of employment]] has begun; but a job applicant owes no duty of disclosure in a job interview.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Fletcher v Krell'' (1873) 2 LJ (QB) 55, a woman who was appointed to the post of governess failed to reveal that she had previously been married. (The employer favoured single women).  It was held that she had made no misrepresentation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Spice Girls v Aprilia World Service'' CHD 24 FEB 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://swarb.co.uk/spice-girls-ltd-v-aprilia-world-service-bv-chd-24-feb-2000/&lt;/ref&gt;
* A contract ''[[uberrima fides|uberrimae fidei]]'' is a contract of 'utmost good faith', and include contracts of insurance, business partnerships, and family agreements.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gordon v Gordon]]'' (1821) 3 Swan 400, two brothers had reached an agreement regarding the family estate. The elder brother was under the impression that he was born out of wedlock and thus not their father's true heir. The agreement was reached on this basis. The elder brother subsequently discovered that this was not the case and that the younger brother had knowledge of this during the negotiation of the settlement. The elder brother sued to set aside the agreement and was successful on the grounds that such a contract was one of uberrimae fidei and the required disclosure had not been executed.&lt;/ref&gt; When applying for insurance, the proposer must disclose all material facts for the insurer properly to assess the risk.&lt;ref&gt;In insurance the insurer agrees to indemnify the assured against losses proximately caused by insured perils, and the insurer is thus entitled to know full details of the risk being transferred to him.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lord Blackburn addressed the issue in ''[[Brownlie v Campbell]]'' (1880) 5 App Cas 925 when he noted "...the concealment of a material circumstance known to you...avoids the policy."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the 1908 case of ''[[Joel v Law Union]]''  [1908] KB 884 the ''de minimis'' rule was applied in a life assurance  policy. Despite minor omissions, the assured had made a sufficiently substantial disclosure of material facts that the insurer knew the risk, and the policy was valid&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''lex non curat de minimis''  - the law does not concern itself with trifles&lt;/ref&gt; The duty of disclosure in insurance has been substantially amended by the [[Insurance Act 2015]].

==The "untrue statement"==
{{Clist misrepresentation}}
To amount to a misrepresentation, the statement must be untrue or seriously misleading.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A statement which is "technically true" but which gives a misleading impression is deemed an "untrue statement".&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Krakowski v Eurolynx Properties Ltd]]'', Krakowski agreed to enter into a contract to buy a shop premises from Eurolynx as long as a 'strong tenant' had been organised. The contract proceeded on the grounds that such a tenant had been arranged. Unbeknown to Krakowski, Eurolynx had entered into an additional agreement with the tenant to provide funds for the first three months rent to ensure the contract went ahead. When the tenant defaulted on the rent and subsequently vacated the premises, Krakowski found out about the additional agreement and rescinded the contract with Eurolynx. It was held that Eurolynx's failure to disclose all material facts about the 'strong tenant' was enough to constitute a misrepresentation and the contract could be rescinded on these grounds.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krakowski v Eurolynx"/&gt; If a misstatement is made and later the representor finds that it is false, it becomes fraudulent unless the representer updates the other party.&lt;ref&gt;''Lockhart v. Osman'' [1981] VR 57, an agent had advertised some cattle as being “well-suited for breeding purposes”. Later on, it was discovered that the stock had been exposed to a contagious disease which affected the reproductive system. It was held that the agent had a duty to take remedial action and correct the representation. The failure by the agent to take such measures resulted in the contract being set aside.&lt;/ref&gt; If the statement is true at the time, but becomes untrue due to a change in circumstances, the representor must update the original statement.&lt;ref&gt;''[[With v O’Flanagan]]'' [1936] Ch. 575, the plaintiff entered into a contract to purchase O’Flanagan’s medical practice. During negotiations it was said that the practice produced an income of £2000 per year. Before the contract was signed, the practice took a downward turn and lost a significant amount of value. After the contract had been entered into, the true nature of the practice was discovered and the plaintiff took action in misrepresentation. In his decision, Lord Wright said, "...a representation made as a matter of inducement to enter into a contract is to be treated as a continuing representation.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[With v O’Flanagan]]'' [1936] Ch. 575, 584.&lt;/ref&gt; Actionable misrepresentations must be misstatements of fact or law:&lt;ref&gt;Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council [1999] 2 AC 349, abolished a bar on mistake of law bar and Pankhania v Hackney LBC [2002] EWHC 2441 (Ch) held the same went for misrepresentation under Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1) where agents of a land seller incorrectly said that people running a car park on some property were licensees rather than protected business tenants&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick v Michel"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWStRp|19|1928|litigants=Fitzpatrick v Michel |parallecite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; misstatements of opinion&lt;ref&gt;''Bisset v Wilkinson'' [1927] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 177 PC&lt;/ref&gt; or intention are not deemed statements of fact;&lt;ref name="Opinion and intention"&gt;See ''[[Achut v Achuthan]]'' [1927] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krakowski v Eurolynx"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|68|1995|litigants=Krakowski v Eurolynx Properties Ltd |parallelcite=(1995) 183  [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 563 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but if one party appears to have specialist knowledge of the topic, his  "opinions" may be considered actionable misstatements of fact.&lt;ref name="Opinion as fact"&gt;See ''[[Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon]]'' [1976] 2 Lloyd's Rep 305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Smith v Land &amp; House Property '' (1884) 28 Ch D 7 CA&lt;/ref&gt; For example, false statements made by a seller regarding the quality or nature of the property that the seller has may constitute misrepresentation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Smith v Land &amp; House Property]]'' (1884) 28 Ch D 7 CA&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Statements of opinion'''
Statements of opinion are usually insufficient to amount to a misrepresentation&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick v Michel"/&gt; as it would be unreasonable to treat personal opinions as "facts", as in ''[[Bisset v Wilkinson]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bisset v Wilkinson]]'' [1927] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptions can arise where opinions may be treated as "facts":
* where an opinion is expressed yet this opinion is not actually held by the representor,&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick v Michel"/&gt;
* where it is implied that the representor has facts on which to base the opinion,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[Smith v Land &amp; House Property Corp]]'' (1884) 28 Ch. D. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* where one party should have known facts on which such an opinion would be based.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[[Esso Petroleum v Mardon]]'' [1976] QB 801.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Statements of intention'''
Statements of intention do not constitute misrepresentations should they fail to come to fruition, since the time the statements were made they can not be deemed either true or false. However,  an action can be brought if the intention never actually existed, as in ''[[Edgington v Fitzmaurice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[Edgington v Fitzmaurice]]'' (1885) 29 Ch. D. 459, company directors seeking a loan "intended to develop the business" always intended to use the cash to repay debts. The state of mind is an existing fact, therefore, a false presentation of an existing fact, so that the contract was voidable.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Statements of law'''
For many years, statements of law were deemed incapable of amounting to misrepresentations because the law is "equally accessible by both parties" and is "...as much the business of the plaintiff as of [the defendants] to know what the law [is].".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Beattie v Lord Ebury]]'' (1872) LR 7 Ch App 777, 803.&lt;/ref&gt; This view has changed, and it is now accepted that statements of law may be treated as akin to statements of fact.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{Cite AustLII|HCA|48|1992|litigants=[[David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia]] |parallelcite=(1992) 175 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 353 |courtname=auto |date=}}; see also {{Cite AustLII|VicRp|31|1978|litigants=Public Trustee v Taylor |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}. While dealing with a mistake of law, similar reasoning should apply to a misrepresentation of law.&lt;/ref&gt; As stated by Lord Denning "...the distinction between law and fact is illusory".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Andre &amp; Cie v Ets Michel Blanc &amp; Fils]]'' [1979] 2 Lloyds LR 427, 430.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Statement to the misled'''
An action in misrepresentation can only be brought by the misled party, or "represent". This means that only those who were an intended recipient of the representation may sue, as in ''[[Peek v Gurney]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Peek v Gurney]]'' (1873) LR 6 HL 377, where the plaintiff sued the directors of a company for indemnity. The action failed because it was found that the plaintiff was not a represent (an intended party to the representation) and accordingly misrepresentation could not be a protection.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary for the representation to have been be received directly; it is sufficient that the representation was made to another party with the intention that it would become known to a subsequent party and ultimately acted upon by them.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite AustLII|HCA|24|1972|litigants=[[Commercial Banking Co (Sydney) Ltd v R H Brown &amp; Co]] |parallelcite=(1972) 126 [[Commonwelath Law Reports|CLR]] 337 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it IS essential that the untruth originates from the defendant.

===Inducement===
The misled party must show that he relied on the misstatement and was induced into the contract by it.

In ''[[Attwood v Small]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1838) 6 Cl&amp;F 232&lt;/ref&gt; The seller, Small, made false claims about the capabilities of his mines and steelworks. The buyer, Attwood, said he would verify the claims before he bought, and he employed agents who declared that Small's claims were true. The House of Lords held that Attwood could not rescind the contract, as he did not rely on Small but instead relied on his agents. ''[[Edgington v Fitzmaurice]]''&lt;ref name="1885 29 Ch D 459"&gt;(1885) 29 Ch D 459&lt;/ref&gt; confirmed further that a misrepresentation need not be the sole cause of entering a contract, for a remedy to be available, so long as it is an influence.&lt;ref&gt;A Burrows, ''A Casebook on Contract'' (Hart, Oxford 2007) 355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Standard Chartered Bank v Pakistan National Shipping Corp (No 2)]]'' [2002] UKHL 43, damages for deceit cannot be reduced for contributory negligence.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gran Gelato Ltd v Richcliff (Group) Ltd]]'' [1992] QB 560&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see ''[[Smith v Hughes]]'' (1871) LR 6 QB 597&lt;/ref&gt;

A party induced by a misrepresentation is not obliged to check its veracity. In ''[[Redgrave v Hurd]]'' &lt;ref&gt;(1881) 20 Ch D 1&lt;/ref&gt; Redgrave, an elderly solicitor told Hurd, a potential buyer, that the practice earned £300 pa. Redgrave said  Hurd could inspect the accounts to check the claim, but Hurd did not do so. Later, having signed a contract to join Redgrave as a partner, Hurd discovered the practice generated only £200 pa, and the accounts verified this figure. [[Lord Jessel]] [[Master of the Rolles|MR]] held that the contract could be rescinded for misrepresentation, because Redgrave had made a misrepresentation, adding that Hurd was entitled to rely on the £300 statement.&lt;ref&gt;The case also makes clear that, the circumstances having altered, Redgrave was under a duty to inform the Hurd of the changes.&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, in ''[[Leaf v International Galleries]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Leaf v International Galleries'' [1950] 2 KB 86&lt;/ref&gt; where a gallery sold painting after wrongly saying it was a [[John Constable|Constable]], [[Lord Denning]] held that while there was neither breach of contract nor operative mistake, there WAS a misrepresentation; but, five years having passed, the buyer's right to rescind had lapsed. This suggests that, having relied on a misrepresentation, the misled party has the onus to discover the truth "within a reasonable time". In ''[[Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd|Doyle v Olby]]'' [1969],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd|Doyle v Olby]]''1969 2 QB 158 CA&lt;/ref&gt; a party misled by a fraudulent misrepresentation was deemed NOT to have affirmed even after more than a year.

==Fraudulent, negligent and innocent misrepresentation==
[[File:Misrep chart.jpg|thumb|A chart of the 3 types of misrepresentation, with definitions &amp; remedies]]
The common law was amended by the [[Misrepresentation Act 1967]]. (Although short and apparently succinct, the 1967 Act is widely regarded as a confusing and poorly drafted statute which has caused a number of difficulties, especially in relation to the basis of the award of damages.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson]]'' [1991] 2 QB 297&lt;/ref&gt; It was mildly amended by the [[Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977]] and in 2012, but it escaped the attention of the consolidating [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]]).

Prior to the Misrepresentation Act 1967, the common law deemed that there were two categories of misrepresentation: fraudulent and innocent. The effect of the act is primarily to create a new category by dividing innocent misrepresentation into two separate categories: negligent and "wholly" innocent; and it goes on to state the remedies in respect of each of the three categories.&lt;ref&gt;Nowhere in the 1967 Act are the words "negligent misrepresentation" to be found; that terminology was established by practising and academic lawyers.&lt;/ref&gt; The point of the three categories is that the law recognises that the defendant may have been blameworthy to a greater or lesser extent; and the relative degrees of blameworthiness lead to differing remedies for the claimant.

Once misrepresentation has been proven, it is presumed to be "negligent misrepresentation", the default category.  It then falls to the claimant to prove that the defendant's culpability was more serious and that the misrepresentation was fraudulent. Conversely, the defendant may try to show that his misrepresentation was innocent.

* '''Negligent misrepresentation''' is simply the '''default category'''.&lt;ref&gt;There is no specific relationship between negligent misrepresentation and the tort of negligence and the duty of care under ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' or ''[[Hedley Byrne v Heller]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
::'''Remedy: '''The misled party may rescind and claim damages under s.2(1) for any losses. The court may "declare the contract subsisting" and award damages in lieu of rescission, but s.2(3) prevents the award of double damages.

* '''Fraudulent misrepresentation''' is defined is the 3-part test in ''[[Derry v Peek]]'', where the defendant is fraudulent if he:
:(i) knows the statement to be false,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Royal Mail Case|R v Kylsant]]''&lt;/ref&gt; or 
:(ii) does not believe in the statement,&lt;ref&gt;A defendant honestly believing his statement to be true is not fraudulent: "Honesty of belief in the truth of a warranty is no defence to a breach of warranty, whereas it is a complete defence to a charge of false representation. If a statement is an honest expression of opinion, honestly entertained, it cannot be said that it involves a fraudulent misrepresentation of fact."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick v Michel"/&gt; or 
:(iii) is [[Recklessness (law)|reckless]] as to its truth.

::'''Remedy''': The misled party may rescind and claim damages for all directly consequential losses. ''[[Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd|Doyle v Olby]]'' [1969]

* '''Innocent misrepresentation''' is "belief on reasonable grounds up till the time of the contract that the facts represented are true". (s.2(1)of the Act).

::'''Remedy''': The misled party may rescind but has no entitlement to damages under s.2(1). However, the court may "declare the contract subsisting" and award damages in lieu of rescission.&lt;ref&gt;The victim of an innocent misrepresentation who wishes to affirm the contract has no legal right to damages. Of course, the misled party may seek to negotiate a compensation payment, but the other party need not comply; and if the misled party litigates to seek "damages in lieu", but the court holds that the contract must subsist, the misled party will lose the case and be liable for costs.&lt;/ref&gt; (By contrast, the victim of a breach of warranty in contract may claim damages for loss, but may not repudiate)&lt;ref&gt;[[Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd|''Hong Kong Fir Shipping v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negligent misstatement==
'''Negligent misstatement''' is not strictly part of the law of misrepresentation, but is a [[tort]] based upon the 1964 ''[[obiter dicta]]'' in ''[[Hedley Byrne v Heller]]'' &lt;ref&gt;''[[Hedley Byrne v Heller]]'' [1964] A.C. 465&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[Judicial functions of the House of lords|House of Lords]] found that a negligently-made statement (if relied upon) could be actionable provided a "special relationship" existed between the parties.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Hedley Byrne v Heller'', the "special relationship" was between one bank who gave a financial reference to another bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently in ''[[Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon]]'' [1976] Q.B. 801&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lord Denning]] transported this tort into [[contract law]], stating the rule as:

''...if a man, who has or professes to have special knowledge or skill, makes a representation by virtue thereof to another…with the intention of inducing him to enter into a contract with him, he is under a duty to use reasonable care to see that the representation is correct, and that the advice, information or opinion is reliable'.

The misled party may normally rescind the contract, and sometimes may be awarded damages as well (or instead of [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]]).

===Rescission===
{{main|Rescission (contract law)}}
A contract vitiated by misrepresentation is [[voidable]] and not [[void (law)|void ''ab initio'']]. The misled party may either (i) rescind, or (ii) affirm and continue to be bound. If the claimant chooses to rescind, the contract will still be deemed to have been valid up to the time it was avoided, so any transactions with a third party remains valid, and the third party will retain [[legal title|good title]].&lt;ref name="shogun"&gt;For legal reasoning application of the difference see ''[[Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson]]'' [2004] 1 [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 919; Brooks, O &amp; Dodd, A ‘Shogun: A Principled Decision’ (2003) 153 ''NLJ'' 1898&lt;/ref&gt; Rescission can be effected either by informing the representor or by requesting an order from the court. Rescission is an equitable remedy which is not always available.&lt;ref&gt;"He who comes to equity must come with clean hands".&lt;/ref&gt; Rescission requires the parties to be restored to their former positions; so if this is not possible, rescission is unavailable.&lt;ref name="Impossibility"&gt;See ''[[Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co]]'' (1878) 3 App. Cas. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

A misled party who, knowing of the misrepresentation, fails to take steps to avoid the contract will be deemed to have '''affirmed''' through "[[Laches (equity)|laches]]", as in ''[[Leaf v International Galleries]]'';&lt;ref&gt;''[[Leaf v International Galleries]]'' 1950] 2 KB 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Affirmation"&gt;See ''[[Long v. Lloyd]]'' [1958] 1 WLR 753. See also {{Cite AustLII|HCA|64|1955|litigants=Alati v Kruger |paralleicte=(1955) 94 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 216 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;in ''Long v Lloyd''  Mr Long bought from Mr Lloyd a lorry advertised as being in ‘exceptional condition,’ said to do 40 mph and 11 miles to the gallon. When it broke down after two days and was doing 5 miles to the gallon, Mr Long complained. Mr Lloyd said he would repair it for half the price of a reconstructed dynamo. Because Mr Long accepted this, when it broke down again, Pearce LJ held the contract had been affirmed. It was too late to escape for misrepresentation. A more lenient approach may now exist. As Slade LJ pointed out in Peyman v Lanjani,[42] actual knowledge of the right to choose to affirm a contract or rescind is essential before one can be said to have "affirmed" a contract.&lt;/ref&gt; and the claimant will be estopped from rescinding. The time limit for taking such steps varies depending on the type of misrepresentation. In cases of fraudulent misrepresentation, the time limit runs until when the misrepresentation ought to have been discovered, whereas in innocent misrepresentation, the right to rescission may lapse even before the represent can reasonably be expected to know about it.&lt;ref name="Lapse"&gt;See ''[[Leaf v International Galleries]]'' [1950] 2 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, third party rights may intervene and render rescission impossible. Say, if A misleads B and contracts to sell a house to him, and B later sells to C, the courts are unlikely to permit rescission as that would unfair impinge upon C.

Under [[Misrepresentations Act 1967]] s. 2(2) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967, the [[court]] has discretion to award damages instead of [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]], "if of opinion that it would be equitable to do so, having regard to the nature of the misrepresentation and the loss that would be caused by it if the contract were upheld, as well as to the loss that rescission would cause to the other party."

===Damages===
{{main| Damages}}
"Damages" are monetary compensation for loss. In contract&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hadley v Baxendale]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and tort,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd|The Wagon Mound]]''&lt;/ref&gt; damages will be awarded if the breach of contract (or breach of duty) causes '''foreseeable''' loss.

* By contrast, a fraudulent misrepresentor is liable in the common law tort of [[deceit]] for all direct consequences, whether or not the losses were foreseeable.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Doyle v Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd]]'' [1969] 2 QB 158]&lt;/ref&gt;
*For negligent misrepresentation, the claimant may get damages as of right under s.2(1) and/or damages in lieu of rescission under s.2(2).
* For innocent misrepresentation, the claimant may get only damages in lieu of rescission under s.2(2).

Given the relative lack of blameworthiness of a non-fraudulent defendant (who is at worst merely careless, and at best may honestly "believe on reasonable grounds" that he told the truth) for many years lawyers presumed that for these two categories, damages would be on a contract/tort basis requiring reasonable foreseeability of loss.

In 1991, ''[[Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Royscott Trust v Rogerson'' [1991] 3 All ER 294 CA&lt;/ref&gt; changed all that. The court gave a [[statutory interpretation|literal interpretation]] of s.2 (which, to paraphrase, provides  that where a person has been misled by a negligent misrepresentation  then, if the misrepresentor would be liable to damages had the representation been made fraudulently, the defendant "shall be so liable"). The phrase '''shall be so liable''' was read literally to mean "liable as in fraudulent misrepresentation". So, under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, damages for negligent misrepresentation are calculated as if the defendant had been fraudulent, even if he has been merely careless.&lt;ref&gt;''Royscott Trust v Rogerson'' is arguably ''[[Mechanisms of the English common law|per incuriam]]'' as the court failed to pay attention to the definition of fraudulent misrep in ''[[Derry v Peek]]''. Had the court done so, it would have held that the misrep in this case was fraudulent rather than negligent.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this was almost certainly not the intention of Parliament, no changes to the law have been made to address this discrepancy.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]] left the 1967 Act intact.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is known as the fiction of fraud and also extends to tortious liability.&lt;ref&gt;Tortious liability has a wider scope than usual contractual liability, as it allows the claimant to claim for loss even if it is not reasonably foreseeable,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} which is not possible with a claim for breach of contract due to the decision in Hadley v Baxendale. Inclusion of the representation into the contract as a [[Contractual term|term]] will leave the remedy for breach in damages as a common law right. The difference is that damages for misrepresentation usually reflect the claimant's [[reliance interest]], whereas damages for breach of contract protect the claimant's [[expectation interest]], although the rules on mitigation will apply in the latter case. In certain cases though, the courts have awarded damages for loss of profit, basing it on loss of opportunity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;name="Opportunity"&gt;See ''[[East v Maurer]]'' [1991] 2 All ER 733.&lt;/ref&gt;

S.2 does not specify how "damages in lieu" should be determined, and interpretation of the statute is up to the courts.

==Vitiating factors==
{{Contract law}}
{{main|Vitiating factors in the law of contract}}
Misrepresentation is one of several [[vitiating factor]]s that can affect the validity of a contract. Other vitiating factors include:
* [[Mistake (contract law)|Mistake]]
* [[Undue influence]]
* [[Duress in English law]]
* [[Duress in American law]]

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Motor Trend'' Car of the Year}}
The '''''Motor Trend'' Car of the Year''' ('''COTY''') is an annual award given by ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine to recognize the best new or significantly refreshed car in a given model year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lieberman |first=Jonny |date=January 2014 |title=Motor Trend Car of the Year 2014: The Strong Thrive: The 65th Anniversary of our Signature Award Finds the Automotive Industry Stronger Than Ever |url=http://www.motortrend.com/oftheyear/car/1401_2014_motor_trend_car_of_the_year_contenders_and_finalists/viewall.html |journal=Motor Trend |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=42–45 |issn=0027-2094 |oclc=423854316 |quote=Our mission was to determine exactly which of this year's 22 new or significantly refreshed contenders is in fact the best. |accessdate=2015-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LhY5uiaK?url=http://www.motortrend.com/oftheyear/car/1401_2014_motor_trend_car_of_the_year_contenders_and_finalists/viewall.html |archivedate=2013-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Motor Trend Car of the Year WAS 2010 8885.JPG|thumb|right|upright|''Motor Trend'' Car of the Year "golden calipers" trophy]]

== Background ==
''Motor Trend'', which debuted in 1949, was the first publication to name a [[Car of the Year]]. The inaugural ''Motor Trend'' Car of the Year award recognized [[Cadillac]]'s [[V8 engine]] in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mueller |first=Mike |title=American Horsepower: 100 Years of Great Car Engines |publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing |year=2006 |page=79 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=69qYnoohrMYC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=1949+Motor+trend+car+of+the+year+award |isbn=978-0-7603-2327-4 |accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest awards were given to the manufacturer or division, not for a specific vehicle. The 1958 [[Ford Thunderbird (second generation)|Ford Thunderbird]] became the first single model to be selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=H091bBCXrH4C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=1958+Thunderbird+was+four-passenger+luxury+car+named+Motor+Trend%27s+Car+of+the+Year |page=7 |title=Standard Catalog of Thunderbird, 1955-2004 |first=John |last=Gunnell |publisher=Krause Publications |year=2003 |isbn= 9780873497565 |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, the [[Ford Torino]] won the COTY while ''Motor Trend'' selected the [[Porsche 914]] for its first Import COTY award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.motortrend.com/classic/features/c12_0606_1970_the_way_we_were/ |title=The Way We Were: 1970 Motor Trend Import Car of the Year |date=May 2006 |publisher=Motor Trend |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the low-volume imported [[Citroën SM]] won the overall COTY award. Between 1976 and 1999, the COTY award was split in two: ''Domestic COTY'' and ''Import COTY.''

The trophy was recombined in 2000 because the distinctions between domestic and import cars became increasingly difficult. The award has expanded to include a [[pickup truck]] (starting in 1979) and a separate [[sport utility vehicle]] (starting in 1999), which are recognized separately from the Car of the Year.

Over time, other publications and organizations have copied Motor Trend's Car of the Year award and created their own.These COTY designations may focus on regional markets, vehicle types, specific market segments, or other criteria. Some examples include the [[European Car of the Year]] that began in 1964 by a collective of automobile magazines, the [[Green Car of the Year]] selected by a panel of automotive and environmental experts, the Tow Car of the Year chosen by selected sponsors in the industry, and the Fleet Car of the Year that is voted by professional fleet managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thetowcarawards.com |title=Tow Car Awards |publisher=thetowcarawards.com |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.automotive-fleet.com/list/tag/fleet-car-of-the-year.aspx |title=Fleet Car of the Year |publisher=Automotive Fleet |accessdate=2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
''Motor Trend'''s Car of the Year is "one of the most prestigious honors bestowed in the auto industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fifty Years of Motor Trend |publisher= MotorBooks/MBI Publishing |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-7603-0781-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trophy for the winner, a depiction of [[calipers]], is often used in the winning automaker's marketing and advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fombrun | first=Charles J. |title=Reputation: Realizing Value from the Corporate Image |publisher=Harvard Business Press |year=1996 |page=172 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=m_4Cbz5f5uUC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=pay+close+attention+to+Motor+Trend+car+of+the+year+award| isbn=978-0-87584-633-0 |accessdate=2010-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rambler Wins 1963 Motor Trend "Car of the Year" Award |journal=Life |volume=54 |issue=10 |page=105 |date=1963-03-08 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oU8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=Motor+Trend+car+of+the+year+Rambler |accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cars that win the award report a spike in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dudley |first=Kathryn Marie |title=The End of the Line: Lost Jobs, New Lives in Postindustrial America |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1997 |page=11 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1YVxDd3FHsQC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=Motor+Trend+car+of+the+year+boost+sales |isbn=978-0-226-16910-1 | accessdate=2010-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hyde |first=Charles K. |title=Riding the Roller Coaster: A History of the Chrysler Corporation | publisher=Wayne State University Press |year=2003 |page=214 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aQhTq18vi7AC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=Motor+Trend+car+of+the+year+boost+sales |isbn=978-0-8143-3091-3 |accessdate=2010-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
To be eligible for the award, a car must be an "all-new" or "substantially upgraded" vehicle that has been on sale within twelve months from the previous November, vehicles that have been on sale for over five years are ineligible for the award.

Between the contenders, it is not a comparison test. In 2014 as an example, the Motor Trend judges debated and evaluate each vehicle against six key criteria:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url= http://media.cadillac.com/media/us/en/cadillac/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2013/Nov/1107-cts-coty.html |title=Cadillac CTS Scores Second Motor Trend Car of the Year Award |date=2013-11-07 |publisher=Cadillac Pressroom |accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
!Criteria!!Note
|- 
|'''Design Advancement'''||well-executed exterior and interior styling; innovative vehicle packaging; selection of materials
|-
|'''Engineering Excellence'''||vehicle concept and execution; clever solutions to packaging, manufacturing and dynamics issues; cost-effective technology that benefits the consumer
|-
|'''Efficiency'''||low fuel consumption and carbon footprint, relative to the vehicle's competitive set
|-
|'''Safety'''||active: help the driver avoid a crash; secondary: protect occupants from harm during a crash
|-
|'''Value'''||competitive price and equipment levels, measured against vehicles in the same market segment
|-
|'''Performance of Intended Function'''||how well the vehicle does the job its planners, designers, and engineers intended
|}

Motor Trend also only considers cars with base MSRPs less than $100,000 in order to avoid expensive luxury and super cars dominating the competition.&lt;ref name=floyd2009&gt;{{cite web |date=2008-09-25 |last=Michael |first=Floyd |title=2009 Motor Trend Car of the Year: The Contenders Are Revealed, What's Your Pick? |url= http://blogs.motortrend.com/6301350/car-of-the-year/2009-motor-trend-car-of-the-year-the-contenders-are-revealed-whats-your-pick/index.html |website=Motor Trend |accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vehicles are subjected a battery of tests: standard car tests such as skid-pad ratings, acceleration and quarter-mile times, and evaluations of the interiors are combined with a track run conducted by [[Sports Car Club of America]]-licensed testers and taking the cars out on normal roads to test their drivability under normal conditions, and fuel economy.

'''Nawwaf bin Abdulaziz''' (16 August 1932 – 29 September 2015) ([[Arabic]]:نواف بن عبد العزيز آل سعود) was a senior member of the [[House of Saud]] and was a close ally of the deceased [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]].&lt;ref name=gsn&gt;{{cite journal|title=Further Prince Sultan succession speculation|journal=Gulf States Newsletter|date=16 January 2009|volume=33|issue=845|url=http://www.gsn-online.com/SSIs/SAMPLES/documents/GSN845.pdf|accessdate=31 May 2012}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Prince Nawwaf was born on 16 August 1932.&lt;ref name=Sharaf2001/&gt; He was the twenty-second son of Ibn Saud.&lt;ref name=GIP&gt;{{cite web|title=HRH Prince Nawaf bin Abdulaziz|url=http://www.gip.gov.sa/sites/english/PreviousPresidency/Pages/HRHPrinceNawafBinAbdulAziz.aspx|publisher=Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, General Intelligence Presidency|accessdate=5 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216030709/http://gip.gov.sa/sites/english/PreviousPresidency/Pages/HRHPrinceNawafBinAbdulAziz.aspx|archivedate=16 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a full brother of [[Talal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Prince Talal]]. Their mother was an [[Armenians|Armenian]], Munaiyir, whose family escaped from the [[Armenian Genocide]] experienced  under the reign of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1915 to 1923.&lt;ref name=jros/&gt; Munaiyir was presented to [[Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman Al-Saud|Abdulaziz]] when she was 12 years old in the place of emir of [[Unayzah]] in 1921. Their first child, Talal, was born in 1924. Following the tradition, Munaiyir became to be known as Umm Talal, "mother of Talal".&lt;ref name=jros/&gt; However, in 1927, the three-year-old Talal died. Later, she gave four children to Ibn Saud, one of them is Prince Nawwaf. It is not exactly known when Abdulaziz divorced his fourth wife and formally wed Munaiyir. It is reported by her family that she remained illiterate all her life.&lt;ref name=jros&gt;{{cite news|last=Rossant|first=John|title=The return of Saudi Arabia's red prince|url=http://www.atimes.com/front/DC19Aa02.html|accessdate=4 May 2012|work=Online Asia Times|date=19 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munaiyir was regarded by British diplomats in Saudi Arabia as one of [[Ibn Saud]]’s favourite wives. She was as known for her intelligence as for her beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stenslie|first=Stig|title=Power Behind the Veil: Princesses of House of Saud|journal=Journal of Arabian Studies: Arabia, the Gulf, and the Red Sea|year=2011|volume=1|issue=1|pages=69–79|doi=10.1080/21534764.2011.576050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Munaiyir died in December 1991.&lt;ref name=Sharaf2001&gt;{{cite book|author=Sabri Sharaf|title=The House of Saud in Commerce: A Study of Royal Entrepreneurship in Saudi Arabia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=51Bb8Ix7xw8C&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=2 April 2013|year=2001|publisher=Sharaf Sabri|isbn=978-81-901254-0-6|pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of [[Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Saud]], his relations with his full-brother Prince Talal became negative, even leading to contesting their inheritances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kechichian|first=Joseph A.|title=Succession in Saudi Arabia|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|pages=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=79Fs5bLPgBYC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=succession+in+saudi+arabia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YFljq6DjSQ&amp;sig=jUyMCiI4Fo3DWpozWA8fR6pC9jY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CuZ-T7bEK9Gp0AWAuoGTBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=succession%20in%20saudi%20arabia&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In view of his experience in various spheres, King Faisal sent him to participate in official delegations of the Kingdom at various meetings, including Arab and Islamic summits and meetings of non-aligned countries. He also led the Kingdom's delegations on behalf of King Faisal or work as his special envoy. Prince Nawwaf was thoroughly familiar with international policy and law, and was also an expert on the Middle East affairs. He did his best to unify the ranks of the Arab emirates and to integrate these emirates into one state following their partitions into seven tiny states during the colonial rule.&lt;ref name=globalsecurity.org/&gt; In view of his rich experience in economic and political spheres, Prince Nawwaf was delegated to serve as the Saudi Government's official spokesman and its special envoy on several occasions.

He also accompanied Crown Prince [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]] during his official foreign trips.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"/&gt; However, Prince Nawwaf did not hold any official position until 2001.&lt;ref name=alb1sep&gt;{{cite news|title=Saudi Prince Criticizes Washington's Policy against Tehran|url=http://www.albawaba.com/news/saudi-prince-criticizes-washingtons-policy-against-tehran|accessdate=6 April 2013|work=Albawaba|date=1 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==
Prince Nawwaf was one of the supporters of [[Free Princes Movement|the Free Princes Movement]] led by his brother Prince Talal in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vijay Prashad|authorlink=Vijay Prashad|title=The Darker Nations- A Biography of the Short-Lived Third World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vY-rhSbio8cC&amp;pg=PA275|accessdate=13 September 2013|year=2007|publisher=[[LeftWord Books]]|isbn=978-81-87496-66-3|pages=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed to the establishment of some industrial projects inside and outside the Kingdom to serve the Arab economy.

==Views==
A Saudi survey conducted shortly after the [[11 September attacks]] concluded that 95 percent of educated Saudi men aged between 25 and 41 supported ‘bin Laden’s cause. Nawwaf bin Abdulaziz argued that this support is motivated by Saudi anger over U.S. support for [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quilliam|first=Neil|author2=Maggie Kamel|title=Modernising Legitimacy: Saudi Strategies|journal=[[Alternatives: Turkish Journal of International Relations]]|year=2003|volume=2|issue=2|url=http://alternativesjournal.net/volume2/number2/kamel.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518172802/http://alternativesjournal.net/volume2/number2/kamel.pdf|archivedate=18 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[US sanctions against Iran|the US sanctions]] against [[Iran]] in 2000, Prince Nawwaf said "Iran is being treated unfairly by some countries and this is not in the interests of the Arabia Gulf or even the US."&lt;ref name=alb1sep/&gt;

The service work that is being sourced may be a [[business process]] or [[software development]].

[https://startnearshoring.com/knowledge/nearshore-vs-in-house-software-development Nearshoring] is a type of outsourcing where a given company seeks a development partner in a different country or region. However, what distinguishes nearshoring from other types of outsourcing is the fact that the development partner is still in close proximity. Since companies are usually in the same time zone, this facilitates communication and allows for frequent visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://startnearshoring.com/knowledge/nearshore-vs-in-house-software-development|title=When IT challenges overwhelm your company - Start Nearshoring|website=startnearshoring.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Nearshoring is a derivative of the business term [[offshoring]].

Offshoring involves shifting work to a foreign, distant organization in order to reduce production costs. Offshoring is subject to several different constraints, however, such as time lag between the parties, differences in local employment laws and practices, and oversight.&lt;ref name="sam"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Western European IT company, say, might outsource software writing to a company in India, which specialises in such work,&lt;ref name="india"&gt;{{cite news

In contrast, nearshoring means that the business has shifted work to a lower cost organization, but within its own region, broadly defined. 

In Europe, nearshoring relationships are between clients in larger European economies and various providers in smaller European nations. Major centers are in [[Spain]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}, [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Portugal]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Belarus]] and the [[Baltic states|Baltic]]. There are also nearshore centers in larger markets, such as [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. These destinations are attractive because they are low-cost, have skilled labor forces, and a less stringent regulatory environment, but crucially they allow for more day to day physical oversight. They also have strong cultural ties to the major economic centers in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A popular type of nearshoring is in software development, with the main benefit being many skilled developers available at low cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nearshore-it.eu/|title=Custom Software Development Company|accessdate=2018-01-22|publisher=nearshore-it.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Call centers, shared services centers, and BPO ([[Business process outsourcing|Business Process Outsourcing]]) are also common choices for nearshoring, as the value of offshore outsourcing hotbeds like Philippines lowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nearshoreamericas.com/philippines-value-proposition-sinks-nearshore-gains-atento/|title=As Philippines Value Prop Sinks, Nearshore Steps Up, Says Atento Exec - Nearshore Americas|date=2017-08-23|work=Nearshore Americas|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The complexity of offshoring stems from different languages and cultures, long distances and different time zones, spending more time and effort on establishing trust and long-term relationships, overriding communication barriers and activities of that kind. Many nearshore providers attempted to circumvent communication and project management barriers by developing new ways to align organizations. As a result, concepts such as [[remote insourcing]] were created to  give clients more control in managing their own projects. Despite recent developments, nearshoring does not necessarily overcome all of the barriers, but the proximity allows more flexibility to align organizations.&lt;ref name="sam" /&gt; 

Nearshoring has become a differentiator for those nations and providers who wish to set themselves apart from sourcing centers in Asia, especially the dominant India, which itself is seeing a sharp decline in BPO job growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nearshoreamericas.com/india-sees-sharp-decline-in-bpo-job-growth/|title=India BPO Reports Sharp Decline in Job Growth - Nearshore Americas|date=2018-04-10|work=Nearshore Americas|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English language is the cornerstone of any Nearshore BPO or IT services operation, and has become a sought-after skill as companies strive to capture a larger chunk of the US market. With the triple helix of university, industry, and government all collaborating to develop the language further, the hunt for skilled, English-speaking talent is slowly becoming easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nearshoreamericas.com/nearshore-english-evolution/|title=The Nearshore English Evolution - Nearshore Americas|work=Nearshore Americas|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operational intelligence''' ('''OI''') is a category of [[real-time business intelligence|real-time]] dynamic, [[business analytics]] that delivers visibility and insight into data, streaming events and [[business operations]]. OI solutions run queries against streaming [[data feed]]s and event data to deliver analytic results as operational instructions. OI provides organizations the ability to [[decision making|make decisions]] and immediately act on these analytic insights, through manual or automated actions.

==Purpose==
The purpose of OI is to monitor business activities and identify and detect situations relating to inefficiencies, opportunities, and threats and provide operational solutions. Some definitions define operational intelligence an event-centric approach to delivering information that empowers people to make better decisions, based on complete and actual information.

In addition, these metrics act as the starting point for further analysis (drilling down into details, performing [[root cause analysis]] — tying anomalies to specific transactions and of the business activity).

Sophisticated OI systems also provide the ability to associate metadata with metrics, process steps, channels, etc. With this, it becomes easy to get related information, e.g., "retrieve the contact information of the person that manages the application that executed the step in the business transaction that took 60% more time than the norm," or "view the acceptance/rejection trend for the customer who was denied approval in this transaction," or "Launch the application that this process step interacted with."

==Features==
Different operational intelligence solutions may use many different technologies and be implemented in different ways.  This section lists the common features of an operational intelligence solution:
* Real-time monitoring
* Real-time situation detection
* Real-time dashboards for different user roles
* Correlation of events
* Industry-specific dashboards
* [[Multidimensional analysis]]
** Root cause analysis
** [[Time Series]] and [[trend analysis]] 
* [[Big data]] Analytics: Operational Intelligence is well suited to address the inherent challenges of Big Data. Operational Intelligence continuously monitors and analyzes the variety of high velocity, high volume Big Data sources. Often performed in memory, OI platforms and solutions then present the incremental calculations and changes, in real-time, to the end-user.

==Technology components==
Operational intelligence solutions share many features, and therefore many also share technology components.  This is a list of some of the commonly found technology components, and the features they enable:
* [[Business activity monitoring]] (BAM) - Dashboard customization and personalization
* [[Complex event processing]] (CEP) - Advanced, continuous analysis of real-time information and historical data
* [[Business process management]] (BPM) - To perform model-driven execution of policies and processes defined as [[Business Process Model and Notation]] (BPMN) models
* [[Metadata]] framework to model and link events to resources
* Multi-channel publishing and notification
* [[Dimensional database]]
* [[Root cause analysis]]
* Multi-protocol event collection

Operational intelligence is a relatively new market segment (compared to the more mature business intelligence and [[business process management]] segments). In addition to companies
that produce dedicated and focussed products in this area, there are numerous companies in adjacent areas that provide solutions with some OI components.

Operational intelligence integrates information, supporting smarter decision making in time to maximize impact. By correlating a variety of events and data from both streaming feeds and historical data silos, operational intelligence helps organizations gain real-time visibility of information, in context, through dashboards, real-time insight into business performance, health and status so that immediate action based on business policies and processes can be taken. Operational intelligence applies the benefits of real-time analytics, alerts, and actions to a broad spectrum of use cases across and beyond the enterprise.

One specific technology segment is AIDC ([[Automatic Identification and Data Capture]]) represented by [[barcodes]], [[RFID]] and [[speech recognition|voice recognition]]. Another specific technology is the OKAPI platform. It is an [[Operational Excellence]] software platform which uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide companies with SMART KPIs. The platform then uses data visualization to track progress of hitting [[Performance indicator|KPIs]].

==Comparison with other technologies or solutions==

===Business intelligence===
{{Main|Business intelligence}}
OI is often linked to or compared with [[business intelligence]] (BI) or [[real time business intelligence]], in the sense that both help make sense out of large amounts of information. But there are some basic differences: OI is primarily activity-centric, whereas BI is primarily data-centric. As with most technologies, each of these could be sub-optimally coerced to perform the other's task. OI is, by definition, real-time, unlike BI or “On-Demand” BI, which are traditionally after-the-fact and report-based approaches to identifying patterns. Real-time BI (i.e., On-Demand BI)  relies on the database as the sole source of events.

OI provides continuous, real-time analytics on data at rest and data in-flight, whereas BI typically looks only at historical data at rest. OI and BI can be complementary. OI is best used for short-term planning, such as deciding on the “next best action,” while BI is best used for longer-term planning (over the next days to weeks). BI requires a more reactive approach, often reacting to events that have already taken place.

If all that is needed is a glimpse at historical performance over a very specific period of time, existing BI solutions should meet the requirement. However, historical data needs to be analyzed with events that are happening now, or to reduce the time between when intelligence is received and when action is taken, then Operational Intelligence is the more appropriate approach.

===Systems management===
{{Main|Systems management}}
System Management mainly refers to the availability and capability monitoring of [[IT infrastructure]].  Availability monitoring refers to monitoring the status of IT infrastructure components such as servers, routers, networks, etc. This usually entails pinging or polling the component and waiting to receive a response.  Capability monitoring usually refers to synthetic transactions where user activity is mimicked by a special software program, and the responses received are checked for correctness.

===Complex event processing===
{{Main|Complex event processing}}
There is a strong relationship between complex event processing companies and operational intelligence, especially since CEP is regarded by many OI companies as a core component of their OI solutions.  CEP companies tend to focus solely on development of a CEP framework for other companies to use within their organisations as a pure CEP engine.

===Business activity monitoring===
{{Main|Business activity monitoring}}
Business activity monitoring (BAM) is software that aids in monitoring of business processes, as those processes are implemented in computer systems. BAM is an enterprise solution primarily intended to provide a real-time summary of business processes to operations managers and upper management.  The main difference between BAM and OI appears to be in the implementation details — real-time situation detection appears in BAM and OI and is often implemented using CEP.  Furthermore, BAM focuses on high-level process models whereas OI instead relies on correlation to infer a relationship between different events.

===Business process management===
{{Main|Business process management}}
A business process management suite is the runtime environment where one can perform model-driven execution of policies and processes defined as [[BPMN]] models. As part of an operational intelligence suite, a BPM suite can provide the capability to define and manage policies across the enterprise, apply the policies to events, and then take action according to the predefined policies. A BPM suite also provides the capability to define policies as if/then statements and apply them to events.

== Partner events ==

In addition to the official events for the Presidential Summit, over thirty partner organizations invited participants to outside events, highlighting how the President and the US Government have helped catalyze a long-term, sustainable conversation on entrepreneurship. During recent months, the State Department coordinated with outside organizations on these related but independent events.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/r/pa/scp/fs/2010/140951.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Events during the week of the Summit on Entrepreneurship included:

* Roundtable discussions hosted by the [[Acumen Fund]], [[Endeavor (non-profit)|Endeavor]], the [[Brookings Institution]], and the [[World Congress of Muslim Philanthropists]];
* Conferences hosted by the Middle East Center on International Cooperation, [[Vital Voices]], the Center for the Study of Islam and Democracy, and the International Council for Small Business;
* Receptions hosted by the [[Kauffman Foundation]] and Businesses for Diplomatic Action / [[Entrepreneurs' Organization]];
* Public Diplomacy Luncheon and Professional Networking events hosted by Al-Mubadarah: [http://www.arabempowerment.org Arab Empowerment Initiative] in collaboration with Aspen Institute's Global Initiative on Culture and Society and
* Video screenings of Ten9Eight at the [[Library of Congress]] and [[Garbage Dreams]] at the [[World Bank]].
* The Global Technology Forum 2010, hosted by [[TechWadi]], focused on building bridges between the US and MENA to accelerate entrepreneurship.

In addition, the US Government hosted special events for delegates, including briefings on business development by the US Small Business Administration, an economic support roundtable at the US Trade and Development Agency, and a reception hosted by the State Department for delegates with the Ambassadors to the United States from delegates’ home countries.

The US Government released an interactive [[Google map]] with detailed information on each of these events, which was embedded on the websites http://www.state.gov/entrepreneurshipsummit/ and http://www.entrepreneurship.gov/summit/ and is available at https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;oe=UTF8&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=101425100571760103462.000483f33a9087a901671&amp;ll=38.901187,-77.057676&amp;spn=0.033665,0.109863&amp;z=14

== Follow-on conferences ==

Several overseas institutions and partners have expressed an interest in hosting Follow-on Conferences to continue to advance the mission of the Entrepreneurship Summit beyond the April 26 and 27 Presidential Summit in Washington. These Follow-on Conferences will be locally or regionally focused and may focus on a specific element of advancing entrepreneurship (e.g. youth entrepreneurship, access to capital, etc.) We have told these partners that we want to be supportive of these events and acknowledge them at the Summit. We have said that we would attempt to have an appropriate USG official attend, but that we would not play any role in organizing them and would not expect to provide any funding assistance.

These Conferences have been initiated by partners who are heeding the President’s call to shared action and responsibility. Through their initiative, they will help to advance what the United States and its partners on the Presidential Summit on Entrepreneurship have started. We have received Statements of Intent for the following Follow-on Conferences:

* [[UAE]]/[[Abu Dhabi]]: The Aspen Institute and the government of the UAE will host a Conference in Abu Dhabi in June 2010 on Innovation.
* [[Iraq]]: The American University of Iraq-Sulaimani will host a conference on Social Entrepreneurship in Sulaimani, Iraq in Spring 2011.
* [[Algeria]]: The U.S.-Algerian Business Council will host a Conference in Algeria on entrepreneurship in the Maghreb in September 2010.
* [[Bahrain]]: The government of Bahrain will host a Conference on innovation, investment and entrepreneurship in December 2010.
* [[France]]: The French-American Foundation has committed to host a Conference on youth entrepreneurship in disadvantaged communities late in 2010 or early in 2011.
* [[Kyrgyzstan]]: The [[American University of Central Asia]], with some Department of State support, will host a Conference on Women Entrepreneurship in Bishkek in May 2010.
* [[UAE]]/[[Dubai]]: The [[Legatum Institute]] at [[MIT]] and the [[Dubai School of Government]] hosted a Conference in Dubai on “Best Practices in Entrepreneurship Policy” in November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/r/pa/scp/fs/2010/140949.htm Follow On Conferences&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public sector consulting''' in the US usually refers to the branch of [[management consulting]] that works with local and federal governments as well as government agencies. Several major management consulting firms (e.g.: [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]], [[Boston Consulting Group|BCG]], [[Booz &amp; Company|Booz&amp;Co]], [[Monitor Group|Monitor]]) do public sector engagements as part of their overall business. The biggest public sector consulting firm in the UK is PA Consulting Group. 

Like management consulting, the goal of public sector consulting is to help organizations improve their performance, primarily through the analysis of existing problems and the development of plans for improvement.

Public sector consulting covers a wide range of areas, including:

* Education
* Defense
* Healthcare
* Environmental policy
* Energy
* Economics &amp; strategic planning
* Technology
* Transportation

Consultants are usually brought in as experts or facilitators on a given project.

'''Richard Bache''' (September 12, 1737 – April 17, 1811), born in [[Settle, North Yorkshire|Settle]], [[Yorkshire]], [[England]], immigrated to [[Philadelphia]], in the colony of [[Pennsylvania]], where he was a businessman, a [[marine insurance]] underwriter, and later served as head of the American Post Office. He also was the son-in-law of [[Benjamin Franklin]].

==Career==
Bache immigrated as a young man in 1760 to New York to join his brother Theophylact in a dry goods and marine insurance business.  After a couple of years, he went to Philadelphia, where he prospered for several years. He was among nearly 30 young men who in October 1766 met at the city's [[London Coffee House]] to found the Gloucester Fox Hunting Club (GFHC), the first in America, to take up a pursuit closely associated with becoming "true Englishmen."&lt;ref name="Skala"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YFF8ynVL4wIC&amp;pg=PA52 Doreen Skala, "Fox Hunting and Anglicization in Eighteenth-Century Philadelphia"], in ''Locating the English Diaspora, 1500–2010'', edited by Tanja Bueltmann, Liverpool University Press, 2012, pp. 61–62, accessed 5 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 1767, Bache suffered financial problems when debts contracted by him were repudiated by his London associate, Edward Green.

==Marriage and family==
[[File:Mrs. Richard Bache (Sarah Franklin, 1743–1808).jpg|thumb|Richard Bache's wife, Sarah Franklin, painted by [[John Hoppner]] (1793)]]
[[File:Benjamin Franklin Bache.jpg|thumb|Benjamin Franklin Bache]]
That year, Bache had proposed to [[Sarah Franklin Bache|Sarah Franklin]] (1743–1808), known as Sally, the only daughter of [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Deborah Read]]. They objected, given his precarious finances and rumors that Bache was a fortune hunter.&lt;ref name="Herbert"/&gt; Although Franklin and his wife Deborah Read never formally approved, they acquiesced to the marriage in 1767.&lt;ref name="Herbert"/&gt; Bache and Sally had eight children together, including [[Benjamin Franklin Bache (journalist)|Benjamin Franklin]], [[Louis Franklin Bache|Louis Franklin]] and [[Richard Bache Jr.|Richard Franklin]].

==Later years==
During the [[American Revolution]], Bache served on the [[Board of War]]. His wife, [[Sarah Franklin Bache|Sally Bache]] (1743–1808), was widely known for her patriotism and charitable activities.

Franklin later arranged an appointment for Bache as the US Postmaster General (1776–1782), to succeed him. After Franklin's death in 1790, Bache and Sally lived off her inheritance from Franklin, moving their family to the Vandegrift residence&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livingplaces.com/PA/Bucks_County/Bensalem_Township/Eddington_Park.html|title=Eddington, Bensalem Township, Bucks County PA|website=www.livingplaces.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1794 along the [[Delaware River]] north of Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="Herbert"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Eugenia W. |last=Herbert |title=A Note on Richard Bache (1737–1811) |journal=Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography |year=1976 |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=97–103 |issn=0031-4587 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descendants==
Their oldest son, [[Benjamin Franklin Bache (Journalist)|Benjamin Franklin Bache]] (1769–1798), became a journalist and publisher, founding a newspaper. He was a spokesman for the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian Republicans]]; he strenuously opposed [[George Washington]], [[John Adams]] and the [[Federalist party]].

Sally and Bache's son, [[Richard Bache Jr.|Richard Bache, Jr.]], served in the [[Republic of Texas]] Navy and was elected as a Representative to the [[Second Texas Legislature]] in 1847.

The U.S. Navy surgeon [[Benjamin Franklin Bache]]  (1801–1881) and the physicist [[Alexander Dallas Bache]] (1806–1867) were grandsons of Sally and Richard Bache, Sr.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12646">'''Shanghai Rubber Stock Market Crisis''' (Chinese: '''橡皮股票风潮'''), was an economic crisis caused by the bankers and stock-holders overstimulating the [[rubber]] stocks in [[Shanghai]] in 1910. This crisis led to a great number of bankruptcies of Chinese native banks in [[Tianjing]], [[Guangzhou]], etc. Historically, this crisis, accomplished with the market crisis in 1920s, brought massive destruction of market development in Shanghai.&lt;ref name=shim&gt;{{cite web|title=一个世纪前 上海"橡皮股票风潮"shim|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/observation/2010-12/31/c_12936548.htm|publisher=Xinhua Agency|accessdate=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In the late period of [[Qing Dynasty]] (the earlier 20th century), the automobile industry was growing, accomplished with the product of rubber. In the [[United States]], the export of rubber increased from $57 million in 1908 to $70 million in 1909. In Britain, the export of rubber grew from 840 thousands pounds in 1908 to 1.41 million pounds in 1909. This demand stimulated prices of the commodity. Under the highest needs of rubbers, many rubbers companies began to wage money from stock markets, which also happened in Shanghai&lt;ref name="shim"/&gt;
.&lt;ref name=stock&gt;{{cite web|title=清代兰格志 股票与橡皮风潮|url=http://www.ct66.com/ProShow.asp?proid=1379|publisher=中 国股票博物馆|accessdate=31 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708212152/http://www.ct66.com/ProShow.asp?proid=1379|archivedate=8 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Langkate]], [[Perak]], [[Kalumpong]], [[Senawang]], [[Tebong]] companies began to collect funds from stock market in 1900s.&lt;ref name="shim"/&gt;

==Process==

=== Fundamentals-driven market===
Accomplished with the higher price of rubber in 1909, the related stock prices got a huge increase. Banks provided a series of convenient services of securities loans for the rubber stocks. First, the foreign banks announced to regulate [[mortgage discount]] at the level of 50%-80%; The Chinese native banks (钱庄) and [[Chinese Merchants Bank]] followed. To a certain extent, these financing activities inflamed the rubber stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ji|first=Zhaojin|title=A history of modern Shanghai banking: the rise and decline of China's finance capitalism|year=2003|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-1003-4|pages=93–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are some stock prices (per share) in this peak period:
{{quote|
* Langkate: 1080 [[Tael]] on March 2nd, 1910; 1300T on March 18th; 1675T on March 29th; then kept at the range between 1400 to 1500 Tael;
* Senawang: 630 [[Tael]] on February 25th, 1910; 750T on March 9th; 1200T on March 18th; 1325T on March 29th; 1425T on March 30th; 1550T on April 7th; 1600T on April 15th; 1650T on April 21st; 1675T on April 25th; 1625T on May 10th; 1400T on May 30th; 1300T on June 27th; 1300T on July 6th; 1375T on July 11th.
}}

At that time, the [[P/B ratio]] of rubber prices in stock market got the peak as 10-20 times; also it was common to see the [[Premium (marketing)|premium]] prices got increasing as eight to nine times.&lt;ref name="shim"/&gt;

=== High premium, stockholder and market speculation ===
Accomplished with the higher stock prices and stimulation of financial organizations, new rubber stocks were issued into market. Since January 1910, more than 10 kinds of new rubber stocks existed in the market. These stocks were increasing with the frantic market; at the same time, the newspapers posted a huge number of advertisements, showing the nice management of rubbers companies and good relationships with banks such as [[HSBC]], [[Shanghai Commercial Bank|SCB]], also announcing that the famous social activists had joined into the [[board of directors]].&lt;ref name="shim"/&gt;

By selling the stocks, these rubber companies also opened account at foreign banks in Shanghai. For example, the Chemor United Rubber Co. posted advertisement for funds at [[Deutsch-Asiatische Bank]]. Java Rubber Co. established account at [[Chartered Bank]].&lt;ref name="stock"/&gt; Besides, Chinese native banks bogged down in this quagmire. Data shows the total of investments was 60 millions [[Tael]], in which the Chinese people held the 70%-80% of stocks. Some native banks not only lent money for investment, but also bought stocks by themselves. In addition, some banks also called loans from other banks.&lt;ref name="shim"/&gt; At the peak period, all kinds of people, including government officials, businessmen, and common employees joined into these investment activities.&lt;ref name="shim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stock"/&gt;&lt;ref name=xinzheng&gt;{{cite web|title=1910年 橡胶股票风潮：摧毁新政成果 促清朝灭亡|url=http://news.ifeng.com/history/zhongguojindaishi/detail_2010_02/20/350021_1.shtml|publisher=ifeng.com|accessdate=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stock-market crashes and failure of government bailout ===
In the middle period of 1910, the United States adopted a policy to barrier the consumption of rubber. In June, the price of rubber dropped dramatically in the international market, which reached the price at nine [[shillings]] and three [[pence]] in the later July, then got a worse price at six shillings.&lt;ref name="stock"/&gt; This brought the decrease tendency in stock market. In July 21, 1910, three Chinese native banks Zhengyuan (正元), Yaokang (兆康), Qianyu (谦余) bankrupted, then five ones closed as follow.&lt;ref name="shim"/&gt;

At the same time, the Daotai (Mayor) of Shanghai [[Cai Naihuang]] (蔡乃煌) and the chairman of Shanghai Commerce Association [[Zhou Jinzhen]] (周金箴) arrived [[Ningbo]] and reported the situations to [[Zhang Renjun]] (张人骏, Liangjiang governor) and [[Cheng Dequan]] (程德全, [[Jiangsu]] governor). Zhang reported this to the center government. On July 27, Qing Dynasty Government approved the loans from the foreign banks.&lt;ref name="xinzheng"/&gt; On August 4, Cai signed a contrast of "Loans for keeping Shanghai's economy" with 9 foreign banks, in which the Shanghai government loaned 3.5 millions Tael. Furthermore, Cai arranged 3 millions Tael from Shanghai Customs (a official budget fund named "Shanghai Custom Treasury", 沪关库款), and saved them into Yuanfengrun (源丰润), Yishanyuan (义善源) banks and their sub-agents. After this attempts, the economy got back to a stable situation temporarily.&lt;ref name="xinzheng"/&gt;

In September, the Qing Government wanted to take 1.9 millions Tael from Shanghai Custom Treasury for repaying [[Boxer Indemnity]]. Based on the considerations of Shanghai's economic situation, Cai Naihuang requested the center government take 2 millions Tael from Daqing Bank (大清银行), the national central bank as an advance payment. This request was sent into the [[Department of Treasury (China)|Department of Treasury]] (度支部). However, Chen Bangrui (陈邦瑞), the vice minister of DOT had terrible relationship with Cai, and he asked Jiangsu Governor to appeal a dismissal of Cai. In this dismissal report, they considered Cai was intimidating the Qing government. After this, Cai reported the [[Grand Council (Qing Dynasty)|Grand Council]] and asked for a late payment, in which he kept emphasizing the importance of not drawing funds from Shanghai Custom Treasury. However, the Grand Council still considered this request as intimidation, and criticized Cai that he had to finish drawing in two months. Therefore, Shanghai Government had to ask funds of 2 millions Tael from Fengrun and Yishanyuan Bank.&lt;ref name="xinzheng"/&gt;

Due to Cai's drawing, accomplished the incident that the foreign banks suddenly refused the [[promissory note]] of 21 Chinese native banks in Shanghai on October 7, Fengrun bankrupted, which led to a chain reaction of six banks' bankrupts. Thus, the foreign banks stopped the loans and requested for debts. The loans suddenly decreased from 10 millions Tael to 0.6 millions in December. The Department of Treasury had to take 1 millions Tael from national center bank to Shanghai. On December 11, Zhang Renjun, the Liangjiang governor asked 3 millions loans from [[HSBC]], [[Crédit Lyonnais]], and [[Deutsch-Asiatische Bank]], and used Jiangsu's Sale Taxes as the guarantee.

In the earlier 1910, 30 Chinese native banks closed. On March 21, Yishanyuan announced its bankrupt. [[Li Jingchu]] (李经楚), the major shareholder of Yishanyuan, also the nephew of [[Li Hongzhang]], is the Vice Minister of Transportation and Manager of the [[Bank of Communications]] (BOC, in which [[Liang Shiyi]] is also a manager). He used the assets as collateral, loaning 2.87 million from the Bank of Communications to save Yishanyuan. In 1911, [[Sheng Xuanhuai]] was appointed as the Minister of Transportation. He began to check the accounts of the Bank of Communications for battling the influence of [[Liang Shiyi]] (梁士诒). Li had to return the loans from Yishanyuan, which led to a fact that Yishanyuan only had 7 thousands Tael on its total account in Shanghai. After the failed attempt of Yishanyuan's manager Ding Weifan (丁维藩), in which he asked loans from Shanghai Government but got refusal; on March 21, Yishanyuan bankrupted and left the debt of 14 millions Tael.

Since Fengrun and Yishanyuan were huge banks and their sub-agents were all over the China, their bankrupts led to a panic among people in [[Beijing]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Chongqing]] and other main cities.&lt;ref name="shim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="xinzheng"/&gt;

==Afterwards==

===Shanghai===
In the earlier 1910, Shanghai totally had 91 native banks. Due to the influence of this crisis, 48 of them (53%) went bankrupt, with a loss of 19.33 million [[Tael]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=清末的"橡皮风潮"：金融危机持续数年|url=http://www.viewcn.com/zhwh/sslh/2198990.html|publisher=华 夏经纬|accessdate=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this crisis, most rubber companies still kept their business, but the reputation had been ruined. Although they still attempted to find some solutions to attract stock-holders, the price of most rubber companies in the stock market had fallen under their [[face value]].&lt;ref name="shim"/&gt;

===Zhejiang areas===
In [[Zhejiang Province]], 18 famous native banks closed in [[Nanjing]], [[Zhenjiang]], [[Yangzhou]], [[Suzhou]], [[Hangzhou]] and [[Ningbo]]. Except for Suzhou, the other five cities' all financial organizations suffered a destructive attack and bankrupted completely.&lt;ref name="xinzheng"/&gt;

===Tianjing===
In July 1910, Chunhuatai Bank (春华泰银号) closed down firstly. In next October, the sub-agent of Shanghai Fenghuirong Bank (上海源丰润) and others followed this tendency with 1 millions debt. In March 1911, after Yishanyuan's bankrupt, not only the native banks, but the foreign banks such as Chartered Bank suffered huge losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Liu|first=Hui|title=清末钱庄多倒闭|url=http://tianjin.enorth.com.cn/system/2004/04/07/000763952.shtml|accessdate=31 January 2011|newspaper=enorth.com.cn|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707015514/http://tianjin.enorth.com.cn/system/2004/04/07/000763952.shtml|archivedate=7 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rubber market===
Due to this crisis, the international rubber prices fell down below 5 shillings. After the outbreak of World War, rubber market was influenced by the shortage and problems of transportation, which led to a lower price of rubber. This situation bogged down until the late 1922.&lt;ref name="shim"/&gt;

== Legal consequences ==

After the rubber crisis the Qing government introduced legislation that taxed speculative profits at a rate of more than fifty percent, leading to the further bankruptcy of two dozen banks in Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ji|first=Zhaojin|title=A history of modern Shanghai banking: the rise and decline of China's finance capitalism|year=2003|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-1003-4|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qing Government===
To a certain extent, this national economic crisis impacted the revenue of Qing Government. Under this pressure, the government had to regain the ownership of some railways, which were managed by local enterprises. After that, [[Sichuan Railway Protection Movement]] (保路运动) broke out in [[Sichuan]] 1911. Because Qing Government had to bring [[Hubei]] Army to repress this movement, the [[Chinese Revolutionary Alliance]] was able to prepare for the [[Wuchang Uprising]], the beginning of [[Xinhai Revolution]].&lt;ref name="xinzheng"/&gt;

A '''skunkworks project''' is a [[project]] developed by a small and loosely structured group of people who [[research and development|research and develop]] a project primarily for the sake of radical [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/skunk%20works | title=Skunk works | work= The [[American Heritage Dictionary]] of the English Language'', Fourth Edition | publisher= reference.com | accessdate= October 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originated with [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]'s World War II ''[[Skunk Works]]'' project.

==Definition==
[[File:Skunkworks-logo.jpg|thumb|The [[Lockheed Martin]] [[Skunk Works]] hangar in Palmdale, California]]
[[Everett Rogers]] defined ''skunkworks'' as an "enriched environment that is intended to help a small group of individuals design a new idea by escaping routine organizational procedures."&lt;ref name="rogers109"&gt;Rogers E. (2003) ''Diffusion of Innovations'', 5th ed., p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originated during [[World War II]] when the [[P-80 Shooting Star]] was designed by Lockheed’s Advanced Development Projects Division in Burbank, California, under similar circumstances. A closely guarded incubator was set up in a [[circus tent]] next to a plastics factory in Burbank. The strong smells that wafted into the tent made the Lockheed R&amp;D workers think of the foul-smelling  “Skonk Works” factory in Al Capp’s ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' comic strip.&lt;ref name="econ2008"/&gt; 

Since its origination with [[Skunk Works]], the term was generalized to apply to similar high-priority [[R &amp; D]] projects at other large organizations which feature a small team removed from the normal working environment and given freedom from management constraints.&lt;ref name="econ2008"&gt;{{Cite journal| url= http://www.economist.com/node/11993055 | title= Idea: Skunkworks| journal= The Economist| date= August 25, 2008 | accessdate=2013-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term typically refers to technology projects developed in semi-secrecy, such as [[Google X Lab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stone|first=Brad|title=Inside Google's Secret Lab|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-22/inside-googles-secret-lab|accessdate=13 February 2014|newspaper=BusinessWeek|date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Daft|first=Richard|author-link=Richard L.

==Evolution of the idea==
''[[The Economist]]'' notes that the expectations for the products developed by skunkworks have changed in the 21st century from "something that makes their competitors say 'Wow'" to "something that makes their competitors' customers say 'Wow'". Rather than sequestering skunkworks, the companies now tend to promote communication between them and marketing, design, and accounting departments.&lt;ref name="econ2008"/&gt;

'''White Collar Zen''' is a project by [[Steven Heine]], who is primarily known for his research on medieval Japanese [[Religion in Japan|religion]] and society. The project deals with the principles of [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]] in relation to the contemporary workplace and professional leadership issues. ''White Collar Zen'' demonstrates how to incorporate [[Zen]] principles into daily work life in order to achieve professional success.

In addition to the book – ''White Collar Zen: Using Zen Principles to Overcome Obstacles and Achieve Your Goal'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2005) – White Collar Zen is a multi-faceted project that includes a unique course on Asian Cultural Values in Business sponsored by the Eugenio Pino Entrepreneurship Center at [[Florida International University]], as well as workshops and conferences on ancient Asian wisdom and modern business.

The Asian Cultural Values in Business course was first taught in fall 2006. On November 17, 2006 a conference was held titled ''From East to West and West to East''. It included four panels that discussed how Asia has influenced the way the West does business and vice versa, and included such topics as Asian investment and international issues, leadership in a global perspective, and Asian cultural values and entrepreneurship. The panels featured student presentations from the Asian Cultural Values in Business course and various other speakers. Among them were authors of business negotiations in Asia: Mark McNeilly (Sun Tzu and the Art of Business: Six Strategic Principles for Managers), Bill Diffenderffer (The Samurai Leader), and Kaihan Krippendorff (The Art of Advantage: 36 Strategies to Seize the Competitive Edge).

==How to Tell a Buddha from a Fox==
In Asia, the mythical [[Kitsune|Fox]] is the primary symbol of how one can become entangled in a web of misunderstanding. The [[Kitsune|Fox]], which appears to its unwitting victim in human form, represents the deception and duplicity that brings with it self-doubt and frustrates the pursuit of aspirations. It is a symbol of undesirable tendencies, such as chasing after unattainable aims while leaving important parts of life unattended. Along with [[Kitsune|Foxes]] who deceive, however, there are always the [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] who are eager to support, not because of personal ties or loyalty, but because they objectively evaluate the merits and demerits of a situation. Both the [[Kitsune|Fox]] and the Buddha are often disguised and each tries to pass as the other for strategic purposes. Distinguishing between them is a valuable skill. As decisions hang in the balance, the Unmoving Mind is a tool to separate truth or authenticity from illusion or untruth. Illusion renders you vulnerable to anxiety and confusion and unable to react to critical situations with clarity and lucidity.

==Elevation–Purification–Activation==
The process of Elevation-Purification-Activation (EPA) cultivates four basic levels of human consciousness: feeling or emotion, speaking or communication, thinking or logic, and knowing or intuitive awareness. When one is controlled by emotions, his or her actions become hasty and s/he is likely to say something inappropriate. The key is to elevate and purify one's feelings so that they are balanced and objective. 

In attaining the Hermit's objective, one can effectively bring about constructive change. Tamed emotions are transmuted into the foundation of productive understanding. Such an understanding enables one to act with the Warrior's effortless, spontaneous creativity.

==The Hermit and the Warrior==
[[Steven Heine|Heine]] describes how [[Zen]] embraces two different and seemingly contradictory yet harmonious paths of behavior. The Way of the Hermit teaches detachment – the mental clarity you need to view your situation dispassionately and impartially, to perceive who is a friend and who is an enemy, to understand what is possible and what is not. The Way of the Warrior teaches the ability to act without hesitation and at the appropriate moment. Together, the ways can prepare one to meet the challenges of the modern world of business.  

Both ways can be applied to contemporary affairs.  The Warrior is always on the move and is able to establish a base of power while transient. The shifts and transitions do not conflict, but in the end enhance the Warrior's abilities. The Hermit is also in a state of continuing transition. A hermit gains strength through passivity, standing back from conflict, looking at things clearly and objectively, and remaining noncommittal until it is absolutely necessary to react. He aggressively pursues passivity by moving, not standing still and seeking out areas and arenas where constructive passivity can best be applied. 

The Warrior is dynamic, assertive and taking a stand. A Hermit is also dynamic in his own way by actively not taking a stand. In integrating the Warrior and Hermit approaches, Zen training provides a timely new paradigm for being clear in thoughts and disciplined in actions to establish harmonious interpersonal relations and attain mutually beneficial goals.

==Encounter vs. Confrontation==
A key objective is to transform dysfunctional conflicts (or Confrontations) rife with antagonism and turmoil into creative negotiations (or Encounters) characterized by shared purposes and cooperation. In a Confrontation, words do not ease tensions or have a reforming impact but cause the basic inflexibility of structure to tighten. It is characterized by personal will and gain, divisiveness, threats, and demands.  It results in a direct challenge based on alternating aggressive and passive attitudes which lead to conflict and discord. 

A Confrontation compounds futility and leads to further misunderstanding, whereas an Encounter is a productive form of negotiation with mutually beneficial results. Through negotiations, agreements, and ongoing teamwork, one can use indirect methods to reach goals by creating situations that facilitate cooperation. Both approaches involve some kind of meeting but the former, by being one-dimensional in attitude, fails to mobilize multiple factors of constructive engagement.

==The Four Steps==
The Four Steps are a means of developing self-discipline and self-control to overcome obstacles at the workplace and achieve success in the professional world through an Encounter. By cultivating the Unmoving Mind and by applying the methods discussed in ''White Collar Zen'', one is able to deal with professional challenges:

===Step 1: Recognize a Crisis in Structure===
Recognize a crisis in the structure of the work organizational environment and work through channels by investigating the roots of the problem, but without jumping to conclusions in either blaming others or remaining unassertive.

===Step 2: Use Words Creatively===
Speak creatively to alter perceptions and receptivity regarding a problem in organizational structure by getting one's message across effectively. One persuades not because of self-interest, but based on genuine commitment to ideals and goals.

===Step 3: Silence as a Tool for Strategic Planning===
Move beyond reliance on words by knowing when to refrain from speaking if verbal communication falls short, and let events take a natural course through waiting patiently yet without becoming overly passive.

===Step 4: Enter the Realm of Anti-Structure===
When both words and no-words fail, a more inventive form of ''White Collar Zen'' is required, which is found in the fourth step, the path of anti-structure. Awakening the Unmoving Mind empowers you to cross over invisible lines of hierarchy and division. Seize the moment for a bold, break the rules anti-structural expression that is based on integrity and responsibility. Cutting through structure involves taking risks but can be appropriate and conducive to progressive interaction and growth.  There are times when the attitudes or behavior of Zen masters are unpredictable and even outrageous in questioning authority that is arbitrary and therefore oppressive.  A famous saying is, "If you see the Buddha on the road, kill the Buddha."  This approach relinquishes any attachment to security and safety and takes a Zen master's leap from a 100-foot pole.
