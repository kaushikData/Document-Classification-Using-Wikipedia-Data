'''Acute stress reaction''' (also called '''acute stress disorder''', '''psychological shock''', '''mental shock''', or simply '''shock''') is a [[psychology|psychological]] condition arising in response to a terrifying or [[Psychological trauma|traumatic event]], or witnessing a traumatic event that induces a strong [[emotional response]] within the individual. It should not be confused with the unrelated circulatory condition of [[shock(circulatory)|shock/hypoperfusion]]. Acute stress reaction (ASR) may develop into delayed stress reaction (better known as [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]], or PTSD) if stress is not correctly managed. ASR is characterized by re-living and avoiding reminders of an aversive event, as well as generalized [[hypervigilance]] after initial exposure to a traumatic event. ASR is differentiated from PTSD as a disorder that precedes it, and if symptoms last for more than one month, it will develop into PTSD. It can thus be thought of as the acute phase of PTSD.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17588928.2014.996212 |pmid=25599382 |title=Acute stress disorder modifies cerebral activity of amygdala and prefrontal cortex |journal=Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=39–43 |year=2015 |last1=Reynaud |first1=Emmanuelle |last2=Guedj |first2=Eric |last3=Trousselard |first3=Marion |last4=El Khoury-Malhame |first4=Myriam |last5=Zendjidjian |first5=Xavier |last6=Fakra |first6=Eric |last7=Souville |first7=Marc |last8=Nazarian |first8=Bruno |last9=Blin |first9=Olivier |last10=Canini |first10=Frédéric |last11=Khalfa |first11=Stephanie }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
The ''DSM-IV'' specifies that ASD must be accompanied by the presence of dissociative symptoms, which largely differentiates it from PTSD.

Dissociative symptoms include a sense of numbing or detachment from emotional reactions, a sense of physical detachment, such as seeing oneself from another perspective, decreased awareness of one’s surroundings, the perception that one’s environment is unreal or dreamlike, and the inability to recall critical aspects of the traumatic event (dissociative amnesia).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Acute Stress Disorder: A Handbook Of Theory, Assessment, And Treatment |last=Bryant |first=R. |last2=Harvey |first2=A. |publisher=American Psychological Association |year=2000 |isbn= |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=3–40, 87–134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the characteristic dissociative symptoms, Acute Stress Disorder from the DSM-5 can present from four other distinct symptom clusters such as&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;:

* Intrusion Symptom Cluster
** recurring and distressing dreams, flashbacks, and/or memories related to the traumatic event.
** intense/prolonged psychological distress or somatic reactions to internal or external traumatic cues.
* Negative Mood Cluster
** a persistent inability to experience positive emotions such as happiness, loving feelings, or satisfaction.
* Avoidance Symptom Cluster
** the avoidance of distressing memories, thoughts, feelings, or external reminders of said distressing memories, thoughts, and feelings of, or closely associated to traumatic event.
* Arousal Symptom Cluster
** Sleep disturbances, hypervigilance, difficulties with concentration, easy to startle, and irritability/anger/aggression.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Causes ==
There are several theoretical perspectives on trauma response, including cognitive, biological, and psychobiological. While the theories are PTSD-specific, they are still useful in understanding ASD, as both share many symptoms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Acute stress disorder (abbreviated ASD, and not to be confused with [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorder]]) is the result of a [[Psychological trauma|traumatic event]] in which the person experiences or witnesses an event that causes the victim/witness to experience extreme, disturbing, or unexpected fear, stress, or pain, and that involves or threatens serious injury, perceived serious injury, or death to themselves or someone else. A study of rescue personnel after exposure to a traumatic event showed no gender difference in acute stress reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1534765606294557 |title=Gender differences and acute stress reactions among rescue personnel 36 to 48 hours after exposure to traumatic event |journal=Traumatology |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=139–42 |year=2006 |last1=Ben-Ezra |first1=Menachem |last2=Essar |first2=Nir |last3=Saar |first3=Ronen }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acute stress reaction is a variation of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD).

A recent study found that a ''single'' stressful event may cause long-term consequences in the brain.  This result calls the traditional distinction between the effects of acute vs chronic stress into question.&lt;ref name="pmid 27698433"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/mp.2016.175 |pmid=27698433 |laysummary=http://neurosciencenews.com/brain-changes-stress-event-5589/ |laysource=Neuroscience News |laydate=November 23, 2016 |title=Acute stress is not acute: Sustained enhancement of glutamate release after acute stress involves readily releasable pool size and synapsin I activation |journal=Molecular Psychiatry |volume=22 |issue=9 |pages=1226–1227 |year=2016 |last1=Musazzi |first1=L |last2=Tornese |first2=P |last3=Sala |first3=N |last4=Popoli |first4=M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pathophysiology ==
Stress is characterized by specific physiological responses to aversive or noxious stimuli.

[[Hans Selye]] was the first to coin the term “general adaptation syndrome”, to suggest that stress induced physiological responses proceed through the stages of alarm, resistance, and exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8199583 |pmc=2560943 |year=1993 |author1=Butler |first1=G |title=Definitions of stress |journal=Occasional paper (Royal College of General Practitioners) |issue=61 |pages=1–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system gives rise to a specific set of physiological responses in response to physical or psychological stress. The body’s response to stress is also termed “fight-or-flight response”, and it is characterized by an increase in blood flow to skeletal muscles, the heart and brain, a rise in heart rate and blood pressure, as well as dilation of pupils, and an increase in the amount of glucose released by the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vander's Human Physiology: The Mechanisms Of Body Function |last=Widmaier |first=Eric P. |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-259-60779-0 |location=Boston |page=182 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The onset of an acute stress response is associated with specific physiological actions in the sympathetic nervous system, both directly and indirectly through the release of [[adrenaline]] and to a lesser extent [[noradrenaline]] from the [[adrenal medulla|medulla]] of the [[adrenal gland]]s. These catecholamine [[hormone]]s facilitate immediate physical reactions by triggering increases in heart rate and breathing, constricting blood vessels. An abundance of catecholamines at neuroreceptor sites facilitates reliance on spontaneous or intuitive behaviors often related to combat or escape.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Normally, when a person is in a serene, unstimulated state, the "firing" of neurons in the [[locus ceruleus]] is minimal. A novel stimulus, once perceived, is relayed from the [[sensory cortex]] of the brain through the [[thalamus]] to the [[brain stem]]. That route of signaling increases the rate of noradrenergic activity in the locus ceruleus, and the person becomes alert and attentive to the environment.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

If a stimulus is perceived as a threat, a more intense and prolonged discharge of the locus ceruleus activates the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (Thase &amp; Howland, 1995). The activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to the release of [[norepinephrine]] from nerve endings acting on the heart, blood vessels, respiratory centers, and other sites. The ensuing physiological changes constitute a major part of the acute stress response. The other major player in the acute stress response is the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]]. Stress activates this axis and produces neurobiological changes. These chemical changes increase the chances of survival by bringing the physiological system back to homeostasis. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsigos|first=Constantine|last2=Chrousos|first2=George P|date=October 2002|title=Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, neuroendocrine factors and stress|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-3999(02)00429-4|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|volume=53|issue=4|pages=865–871|doi=10.1016/s0022-3999(02)00429-4|issn=0022-3999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The autonomic nervous system controls all automatic functions in the body and contains two subsections within it that aids in response to an acute stress reaction. These two subunits are the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic response is colloquially known as the "[[Fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]]" response, indicated by accelerated pulse and respiration rates, pupil dilation, and a general feeling of anxiety and hyper-awareness.  This is caused by the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal glands. The epinephrine and norepinephrine strike the beta receptors of the heart, which feeds the heart sympathetic nerve fibers in order to increase the strength of heart muscle contraction; as a result more blood gets circulated, increasing the heart rate and respiratory rate. The sympathetic nervous system also stimulates the skeletal system and muscular system in an effort to pump more blood to those areas to handle the acute stress. Simultaneously the sympathetic nervous system inhibits the digestive system and the urinary system in order to optimize blood flow to the heart, lungs, and skeletal muscles. This plays a role in the alarm reaction stage. The para-sympathetic response is colloquially known as the "rest and digest" response, indicated by reduced heart and respiration rates, and more obviously by a temporary loss of consciousness if the system is fired at a rapid rate. The parasympathetic nervous system stimulates the digestive system and urinary system in order to send more blood to those systems to increase the process of digestion. In order to do this, it must inhibit the cardiovascular system and respiratory system in an effort to optimize blood flow to the digestive tract causing low heart and respiratory rates. Parasympathetic plays no role in acute stress response (VanPutte Regan Russo 2014).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Wilderness and Rescue Medicine |last=Isaac |first=Jeffrey E. |last2=Johnson |first2=David E. |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-7637-8920-6 |location=Burlington, MA |pages=27–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown that patients with ASD have overactive right amygdalae and pre-frontal cortices, both structures that are involved in the fear-processing pathway.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Diagnosis==
According to the DSM 5, symptom presentation must last for 3 days in order for a diagnosis of ASD to be made. If symptoms persist past 1 month, the diagnosis of PSTD is explored.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5 ed.)|last=American Psychiatric Association|first=|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|year=2013|isbn=|location=Arlington, VA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
There must be a clear temporal connection between the impact of an exceptional stressor and the onset of symptoms; onset is usually within a few minutes or days but may occur up to one month after the stressor. In addition, the symptoms show a mixed and usually changing picture; in addition to the initial state of "daze," depression, anxiety, anger, despair, overactivity, and withdrawal may all be seen, but no one type of symptom predominates for long; the symptoms usually resolve rapidly in those cases where removal from the stressful environment is possible; in cases where the stress continues or cannot by its nature be reversed, the symptoms usually begin to diminish after 24–48 hours and are usually minimal after about 3 days.&lt;ref name="Mental-Health-Matters.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mental-health-matters.com/disorders/anxiety-disorders/acute-stress |title=Acute Stress Disorder&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2013-07-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726172815/http://www.mental-health-matters.com/disorders/anxiety-disorders/acute-stress |archive-date=2013-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''DSM-5'' specifies there is a higher prevalence rate of ASD in females compared to males due to higher risk of experiencing traumatic events and neurobiological gender differences in stress response that increase the risk of ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5 ed.)|last=American Psychiatric Association|first=|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|year=2013|isbn=|location=Arlington, VA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==
This disorder may resolve itself with time or may develop into a more severe disorder such as PTSD. However, results of Creamer, O'Donnell, and Pattison's (2004) study of 363 patients suggests that a diagnosis of acute stress disorder had only limited predictive validity for PTSD. Creamer et al. did find that re-experiences of the traumatic event and arousal were better predictors of PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0005-7967(03)00141-4 |pmid=14975772 |title=The relationship between acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder in severely injured trauma survivors |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=315–28 |year=2004 |last1=Creamer |first1=Mark |last2=o'Donnell |first2=Meaghan L |last3=Pattison |first3=Phillipa }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early pharmacotherapy may prevent the development of posttraumtic symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14573324 |year=2003 |author1=Vaiva |first1=G |title=Immediate treatment with propranolol decreases posttraumatic stress disorder two months after trauma |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=54 |issue=9 |pages=947–9 |last2=Ducrocq |first2=F |last3=Jezequel |first3=K |last4=Averland |first4=B |last5=Lestavel |first5=P |last6=Brunet |first6=A |last7=Marmar |first7=C. R |doi=10.1016/s0006-3223(03)00412-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, early trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TFCBT) for those with a diagnosis of ASD can protect an individual from chronic PTSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kornør|first=Hege|last2=Winje|first2=Dagfinn|last3=Ekeberg|first3=Øivind|last4=Weisæth|first4=Lars|last5=Kirkehei|first5=Ingvild|last6=Johansen|first6=Kjell|last7=Steiro|first7=Asbjørn|date=September 2008|title=Early trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy to prevent chronic post-traumatic stress disorder and related symptoms: A systematic review and meta-analysis|url=|journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume=8|pages=8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have been conducted to assess the efficacy of counselling and psychotherapy for people with ASD. Cognitive behavioral therapy which included exposure and cognitive restructuring was found to be effective in preventing PTSD in patients diagnosed with ASD with clinically significant results at 6 months follow-up. A combination of relaxation, [[cognitive restructuring]], imaginal exposure, and in vivo exposure was superior to supportive counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Lambert |editor1-first=M.J. |year=2004 |title=Bergin and Garfield's Handbook of Psychotherapy and Behavioral Change |location=New York |publisher=Wiley }}{{page needed|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mindfulness]] based stress reduction programs also appear to be effective for stress management.&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/2156587214543143 |pmid=25053754 |title=Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction as a Stress Management Intervention for Healthy Individuals |journal=Journal of Evidence-Based Complementary &amp; Alternative Medicine |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=271–86 |year=2014 |last1=Sharma |first1=Manoj |last2=Rush |first2=Sarah E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a wilderness context where counseling, psychotherapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy is unlikely to be available, the treatment for acute stress reaction is very similar for the treatment of [[cardiogenic shock]], [[Shock (circulatory)|vascular shock]], and [[hypovolemic shock]]; that is, allowing the patient to lie down, providing reassurance, and removing the stimulus for the occurrence of the reaction.  In traditional shock cases, this is generally the relieving of pain from injuries or the stopping of blood loss.  In an acute stress reaction, this may be pulling a rescuer away from the emergency to calm down, or blocking the sight of an injured friend from a patient.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
== History ==
The term ASR was first used to describe the symptoms of soldiers during [[World War I]] and [[World War II|II]], and it was therefore also termed [[combat stress reaction]] (CSR). Approximately 20% of U.S. troops displayed symptoms of CSR during WWII, and it was assumed to be a temporary response of healthy individuals to witnessing or experiencing traumatic events. Symptoms include depression, anxiety, withdrawal, confusion, paranoia and sympathetic hyperactivity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[American Psychological Association|APA]] officially included the term ASD in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]]'' in 1994, and prior to that, symptomatic individuals within the first month of trauma were diagnosed with [[adjustment disorder]]. According to the ''DSM IV'', ASR refers to the symptoms experienced right after exposure to a traumatic event, up until 48 hours after it. In contrast, ASD is defined by symptoms experienced after 48 hours of the event, up until one month past the event. Symptoms experienced for longer than one month are consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Alexis Dworsky''' (born May 14, 1976, in [[Freising]]) is an [[conceptual art]]ist and [[Cultural studies|cultural scientist]] from Germany. He performs artistic research that combine practical and theoretical approaches.

== Biography ==
Dworsky initially studied landscape architecture at the Technical University of Munich, followed by studies at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts in Munich]] with [[Res Ingold]]. Dworsky received his doctorate in 2011 from [[Bazon Brock]] in [[aesthetics]] at the [[University of Wuppertal]] on the cultural history of the dinosaur. From 2001 to 2007, Dworsky was curator in the art space Lothringer13, Munich. From 2012 to 2018, he was a teacher at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich.

Dworsky works as a freelance artist, cultural scientist, and curator. In particular, Dworsky works in and about the [[public space]].  A peculiarity of Dworsky's approach is to also regard the digital-media space as a public space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alexisdworsky.de/|title=Alexis Dworsky|last=Dworsky|first=Alexis|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12409">The '''Alsószentmihály inscription''' is an [[inscription]] on a building stone in [[Mihai Viteazu, Cluj]] ([[Transylvania]], today [[Romania]]). The origins and translation of the inscription are uncertain.

== The relic ==
[[File:Alsoszentmihaly rovas felirat fenykep.png|thumb|The photo of the Alsószentmihály inscription]]
The stone was an ancient Roman building stone—proved by the leaf-symbol, a frequently applied ornamental element of ancient Roman inscriptions—reused in the 10th century. Alsószentmihály located on the territory of the late [[Dacia Aureliana|Province Dacia]] existed up to the middle of the 3rd century. Dénes showed that the [[Kabar|Khavars]] (Khazar rebels joined the Hungarians in the 9th century&lt;ref&gt;Kristó, Gyula &amp; Makk, Ferenc (2001): ''A kilencedik és a tizedik század története'' [The history of the 9th and the 10th centuries], p. 52. In: ''Magyar Századok'' [Hungarian Centuries]. Published by Pannonica Kiadó, Ser. ed.: Gyula Szvák, 222 p.&lt;/ref&gt;) probably settled in this region (that time Transylvania).&lt;ref&gt;Dénes, József (1984-1985): ''A magyarok hét neme és hét országa (A magyar “törzsek” elhelyezkedése a Kárpát-medencében”)'' [The seven gens and seven countries of the Magyars (The allocation of the Magyar “tribes” in the Carpathian Basin)]. In: ''Móra Ferenc Múzeum Évkönyve'' [The Annual of the Ferenc Móra Museum of Szeged], Szeged, 1991, p. 573&lt;/ref&gt; In some parts of Hungary, there are data of the Khavars even from the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Györffy, György (1990): ''A magyarság keleti elemei''.

==Script used for the Alsószentmihály inscription==
Some quotations from historian [[Gábor Vékony]] about the identification of the script in this inscription:

* Vékony wrote in page 218: "Mivel az alsószentmihályi felirat nem a székely rovásírás elterjedési területén található, s az első sorban csak magánhangzókat olvashatnánk egymás mellett a székely ábécé alapján, nyugodtan kijelenthetjük, hogy a feliratnak csak a székely íráson kívüli magyarázata lehet." Translated: "Since the Alsószentmihály inscription was found not in the geographical area of the Old Hungarian script, and in the first line, only vowels could be read based on the [[Szekely alphabet]], we can state surely that the possible transcription of the inscription is surely out of the Szekely script".&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó, page 218, first five rows of the first paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vékony wrote in page 230: "Összefoglalóan megállapíthatjuk, hogy az alsószentmihályfalvi felirat az Erdélybe került kavarok emléke, amely természetesen kazárul, kazár írással íródott.". Translated: "To summarize, we can state that the Alsószentmihály Village inscription is the relic of the Khavars settled into Transylvania, which is naturally written in Khazar with Khazarian script."&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó, page 230, first three rows of the second paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vékony wrote in page 280: "Hasonló jel előfordul más kazáriai rovásfeliratokon is." Translated: ''Similar symbol occurs in other Khazarian runic inscriptions as well.''&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó, page 280, fifth and sixth rows of the fourth paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vékony wrote in page 109:"Erdélyben, az alsószentmihályfalvi templomba másodlagosan beépített kő felirata egyértelműen a kazár rovásábécével íródott.". Translated: "In Transylvania, the inscription of the reused stone built into the wall of the church of the Alsószentmihály Village is unambiguously written with Khazarian runic alphabet."&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó, page 109, last third of the second paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the quotations above examples, it can be stated that Vékony identified the script of the Alsószentmihály relic as a Khazarian script. According to Vékony, another relic, namely the [[Homokmégy-Halom inscription]] contains Khazarian text as well.&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó, page 218, first five rows of the first paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

== The meaning of the inscription ==

The Alsószentmihály inscription was deciphered by archaeologist [[Gábor Vékony]].

The transcription of Vékony (it uses [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbols):&lt;ref&gt;[[Gábor Vékony|Vékony, Gábor]]  (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Gábor Vékony|Vékony]], the inscription was made by a [[Kabar|Khavar]] leader, whose religion was [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gábor Vékony|Vékony, Gábor]] (1985): Késő népvándorláskori rovásfeliratok [Rovas inscriptions from the Late Migration Period]. In: Életünk Vol. XXII, No. 1, pp. 71-84&lt;/ref&gt; The first symbol of the first row is a ligature, its transcription: '''&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;tl&lt;sup&gt;ï&lt;/sup&gt;ɣ'''.&lt;ref&gt;Vékony, Gábor (1985): Késő népvándorláskori rovásfeliratok [Runic inscriptions from the Late Migration Period]. In: Életünk Vol. XXII, No. 1, pp. 71-84&lt;/ref&gt; The first symbol (from left) in the second row is a Khazarian word separator.&lt;ref&gt;Vékony Gábor (2004): A székely írás emlékei, kapcsolatai, története. Budapest: Nap Kiadó, page 217&lt;/ref&gt;

In the inscription, the third symbol of the first row (from left), and the symbol in the second and last place can be considered as the descendants of the [[Turkic ideograms]]. Nevertheless, their relation needs more evidence.

==Critics, alternative theories==
There are several critics of Vékony's theories and translations, most notably the Hungarian [[Linguistics|linguist]] and historian, [[András Róna-Tas]]. The debates were summarized{{How|date=June 2016}} by István Riba in 1999 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Riba,István: Jöttek, honfoglaltak, fújtak. Régészvita egy rovásírásról [Came, settled, blown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53235">{{Theosophy}}
In the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], '''Ascended Masters''' are believed to be spiritually [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]] beings who in past [[incarnation]]s were ordinary humans, but who have undergone a series of spiritual transformations originally called [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiations]].

Both "[[Mahātmā#Theosophy|Mahatma]]" and "Ascended Master" are terms used in the Ascended Master Teachings. Ascended Master is based on the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] concept of the Mahatma or [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]. However, Mahatmas and Ascended Masters are believed by some to differ in certain respects.

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, a "Master", "Commoner", "Shaman", or "Spiritual Master" is a human being who has taken the Fifth Initiation and is thereby capable of dwelling on the 5th dimension. An "Ascended Master" is a human being who has taken the Sixth Initiation, also referred to as Ascension,&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher ed. ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities'', Oxford University Press, USA, 2004. Describes the Theosophical Society and religious organizations based on a belief in Ascended Masters, such as The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom and The Summit Lighthouse. pp. 330–334.&lt;/ref&gt; and is thereby capable of dwelling on the 6th dimension. An "Ascended Master" is a human being who has regained full union with his "Mighty I AM Presence." When a human being has regained full union with his "Mighty I AM Presence," that state of full union is referred to as "Ascension." Technically, a human being "ascends" when he takes the Sixth Initiation, and not before then.

A "Chohan" (Lord) of a "Ray" is an Ascended Master who has been placed in charge of one of the 12 "Rays" (until recently, 7 Rays were generally known, and 5 Rays were "secret"), due to having an extraordinary natural spiritual affinity for that Ray. A "Ray" is a concentrated stream of spiritual energy emanating, ultimately, from the Godhead. Each "Ray" is the embodiment/expression of one of the 12 great God-Qualities, such as Divine Will, Divine Wisdom, Divine Love, etc. The "Chohans (Lords) of the Rays" thus constitute a special grouping of Ascended Masters (Sixth Level Initiates).

Those who have taken the Seventh Initiation hold the Senior Administrative Posts in the [[Great White Brotherhood]] on Earth. These senior administrative posts are divided into 3 departments: The Department of the Manu, the Department of the Planetary Christ, and the Department of the Mahachohan. "

A "Lord of the World" is a human being (or another organism) who has taken the Ninth Initiation. According to ascended master teaching, The Ninth Initiation is the highest Initiation possible on, what is believed to be a 9d-dimensional planet grid such as Earth by Ascended Master Teaching believers. They believe this will be until the end of [[2012 phenomenon|21 December, 2012]]. [[Sanat Kumara]] (a "Lord of the Flame" originally from the higher-dimensional levels of the planet Venus) was the original being who held the spiritual office of "Lord of the World"  here on planet Earth.

The term "Ascended Master" was first used by [[Baird T. Spalding]] in 1924 in his series of books, "The Life and Teachings of the Masters of the Far East" (DeVorss and Co.). Godfre Ray King further popularized this concept of spiritual masters who had once lived on the earth in his book ''Unveiled Mysteries'' &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''Unveiled Mysteries''. Chicago, Illinois: Saint Germain Press, 1934, p. vii: "The time has arrived, when the Great Wisdom, held and guarded for many centuries in the Far East, is now to come forth in America, at the command of those Great Ascended Masters who direct and protect the evolution of mankind upon this Earth."&lt;/ref&gt; (1934) by [[Guy Ballard]] (1878-1939). Ballard was the founder of the first "Ascended Master Teaching" in modern times, known as The [["I AM" Activity]] (in full: The "I AM" Religious Activity of the Saint Germain Foundation ).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Saint Germain Foundation. ''The History of the "I AM" Activity and Saint Germain Foundation''. Schaumburg, Illinois: Saint Germain Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The teachings were continued and embellished by later organizations such as [[The Bridge to Freedom]]&lt;ref name="Freedom Journal 1961"&gt;''The Bridge to Freedom Journal'' (1951-1961) Reprinted by Ascended Master Teaching Foundation, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; (founded 1951) (known in the 1980s as The New Age Church of the Christ, and later as The Bridge to Spiritual Freedom), [[The Summit Lighthouse]]&lt;ref name="Lewis, James R. 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''White Paper - Wesak World Congress 2002''.

Braden|Braden, Charles S.]] ''These Also Believe'', MacMillan Publishing Company 2000, pp. 257–307.&lt;/ref&gt; A more modern form of the teachings, which did not rely on "channeled" messages, was given by a former associate of Godfre Ray King, Pearl Dorris, in Mount Shasta, California, beginning on October 20, 1972 and continuing until her death in Yreka, California in 1990 (See her biography: ''Lady Master Pearl, My Teacher'' by Peter Mt. Shasta, also the book she helped channel, ''Step by Step: Ascended Master Discourses''). Her emphasis was on learning to feel and identify  with the I AM Presence within, rather than invoking the "Presence" as an external mental principle. Under her tutelage, [[Peter Mt. Shasta]] was trained to continue the Masters' teachings, working today to incorporate the inner teachings of the Far East and their emphasis on self-observation, with the dynamic I AM teachings that uses affirmations to develop mastery in daily life. See ''Apprentice to the Masters: Adventures of a Western Mystic, Book II''. In [[Peter Mt. Shasta]]'s third autobiographical book ''My Search in Tibet for the Secret Wish-Fulfilling Jewel'' he mentions the widely held belief in Tibet that yogis ascend, ''jalus'' (Tibetan), by dissolving the five elements and raising the Nirmanakaya and Sambogakaya bodies into the Dharmakaya (known also as Atman, Monad, or I AM Presence).

The rays, the divine evolutions of peoples and planets are represented by 7 colors (new age) and more 5 colors (new age gold or solar rays). The colors of new age and solar rays are (in order): 1 blue (power of faith); 2 yellow (obedience); 3 pink (beauty; geniality); 4 white (ascension; peace; light); 5 green (nature); 6 red (true resurrection); 7 violet (New Age of Master Saint Germain); 8 turquoise (lucidity); 9 magenta (divine wonder; justiciars); 10 gold (materialization of wealth); 11 orange (sunshine); 12 Opaline (renewal).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Definition==
Students of Ascended Master Teachings organizations (also known as Ascended Master Activities) believe that the Presence of Life — God — individualizes as "Mighty I AM Presences," which then incarnate in lower-dimensional subtle and gross bodies throughout the created universes. They believe that their Teachings have been given to humanity by the Ascended Masters. Ascended Masters are believed to be individuals who have lived in physical bodies, acquired the Wisdom and Mastery needed to become Immortal and Free of the cycles of "re-embodiment" and karma, and have attained their "Ascension" (the Sixth Initiation). They consider the Ascension to be the complete permanent union of the raised and purified outer self with their Mighty "I AM" Presence - that True Identity that is the unique Individualization of Almighty God residing in each person. This knowledge is believed to have previously been taught for millions of years only within "Ascended Master Retreats" and "Mystery Schools". It is believed by adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings that this wisdom was partially released by the [[Theosophical Society]] beginning in 1875, by [[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Alice A. Bailey]], and began to have more detailed public release in the 1930s by the ''Ascended Masters'' through [[Guy Ballard]] in the [[I AM Activity]].&lt;ref name="The_Magic_Presence"&gt;King, Godfre Ray.

Luk" was the pseudonym of Alice Beulah (Schutz) Booras (April 10, 1905 - Jan. 14, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; However, theosophists maintain that the concept of Ascended Master is an exaggeration and corruption of the more modest theosophical concept of "Master of the Ancient Wisdom."[https://www.theosophical.org/publications/quest-magazine?id=2382]  A similar problematic conflation of the term exits in the case of the Alice Bailey teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Beliefs about Ascended Masters==
Originally presented by [[Helena P. Blavatsky]] in the 1870s, the idea of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom or Mahatmas was adopted by people who at some point had had a connection with the Theosophical movement, such as Alice Bailey, [[Helena Roerich]], and [[Manly P. Hall]]. Later on many other organizations, especially in the [[United States]], developed the concept of Ascended Masters, which departs from the theosophical one in several aspects.

It is believed{{By whom?|date=August 2013}} that Ascended Masters are individuals who were formerly embodied on the Earth and learned the lessons of life during their incarnations. They gained mastery over the limitations of the [[Plane (esotericism)|matter plane]]s, balanced at least 51% of negative [[karma]], and fulfilled their [[Dharma]] (divine plan). An Ascended Master, in such an understanding, has become [[God]]-like and a source of unconditional "Divine Love" to all life, and through the Ascension has united with his or her own "God Self," the "I AM Presence."

It is further claimed by various groups and teachers that the Ascended Masters serve as the teachers of mankind from the realms of [[Spirit]], and that all people will eventually attain their Ascension and move forward in spiritual evolution beyond this planet. According to these teachings, they remain attentive to the spiritual needs of humanity, and act to inspire and motivate its spiritual growth. In many traditions and organizations, they are considered part of the ''Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth'', and members of the ''Great Brotherhood of Light'', also known as the ''Great White Lodge,'' ''[[Great White Brotherhood]],'' or ''Universal White Brotherhood'' (per [[Peter Deunov]]).&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life - Book I''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications, 1989, pp. 23-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alice Bailey and [[Benjamin Creme]] there are sixty ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom'', defined as beings who have reached the Fifth Level of Initiation or above, with Djwhal Khul in a pivotal role as the master who telepathically dictated the many [[esoteric]] teachings in Baileys' books. [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] revealed, by taking "dictations" from them, the names of many dozens of additional Ascended Masters that were previously unknown.

The concept of recognizing the spiritual self, one's own psychological and karma battles and how to overcome them, and eventual Ascension of all humanity is covered in [[James Redfield]]'s ''[[Celestine Prophecy]]'' and its sequels, ''[[The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision]]'' and ''[[The Secret of Shambhala: In Search of the Eleventh Insight]]''.  These books, while controversial, are recent popularizations of the concept of Ascension.

In Ascended Master teachings there is also mention of Serapis Bey, a being who was incarnated as a high priest in one of the "Temples of the Sacred Fire" on [[Atlantis]], and who migrated to [[Egypt]] at the time of the destruction of Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare ''Lords of the Seven Rays''. Summit University, Livingston, Montana, USA, 1986, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed {{By whom|date=February 2017}} that he was incarnated as the Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] [[Amenhotep III]] (who constructed the [[Temple of Luxor]] to the god [[Amun|Amon]])&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare ''Lords of the Seven Rays'', p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; and also as [[Leonidas]], the King of [[Sparta]],&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare ''Lords of the Seven Rays'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; who was killed in 480 BC defending the pass of [[Thermopylae]] against the invasion of [[Greece]] by Emperor [[Xerxes I]] of the [[Persian Empire]]. According to teachings of Agni Yoga,&lt;ref&gt;Roerich, Elena Ivanovna. ''Letters to America''. In 4 Vols (1923–1952).  T. 4. Moscow: Sfera, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Serapis Bey purports to be, in past lives, the Roman king [[Numa Pompilius]], and the philosophers [[Confucius]], [[Plato]] and [[Seneca the Younger]] (Lucius Annaeus Seneca). He is referred to in the book ''Supermundane'' as ''The Thinker''.

===Universal All-Pervading Presence of Life===
This is properly called Isness; students of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that there is One God, the "Universal All-Pervading Presence of Life", "The One", Who is the Source of all Love, Light, and Truth in existence, and that all forms of existence and consciousness emanate from this "Allness of God" - "The One". ''The Voice of the I AM'' states "All Life is One" &lt;ref&gt;''The Voice of the I AM''. Saint Germain Press December 1940 page 32&lt;/ref&gt; and that there is "One Substance, One Energy, One Power, One Intelligence" as the Source of all consciousness and creation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Voice of the I AM'', Saint Germain Press, July 1942, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This Divine Being and Mind is considered to be above and distinct from all creation (in the sense of classical [[theism]]), transcending all creation yet interpenetrating all existence. Belief in this one God stresses the essential unity of the spiritual and material components of the universe. God creates through Individualized Identities that have distinct Self-Consciousness and that make up the Spiritual Hierarchy of Creation, yet remain connected through the flow of the "River of Life" and "Lifestream" to the one undivided God — the All in All — the Good — the Source from which all Life, Light, and Love come.(or from which all things, yin &amp; yang come. Even what one may perceive as darkness "evil" or "bad" is in someway working out for the Good and toward the elevation and ascension of all people. All things pervading or pouring out from the One perfect intelligent mind i.e. God), there is always an uninterrupted Oneness that is maintained with the Allness of God. From the One God all other realities, including Hierarchy, humanity and the material universe, are the result of a process of emanation.

===The Individualized "I AM" Presence===
This is properly called Atma Brahman; adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that each person is an incarnation of an "Individualized Presence" of the "Most High Living God" — the "Mighty I AM Presence" — as part of humans' very nature and being. God (as Life and Love) manifests in the 7 octaves of the created universe through individual Divine Identities. As embodied individuals, we are the outer expression of that God Self in form. It is our unique and immortal True Identity, yet always sharing in the Allness of the ONE GOD.

==Origins==
The founder of the Theosophical Society, Helen Blavatsky, in the late 19th century brought attention to the idea of secret initiatory knowledge, by claiming her ideas were based on traditions taught to her by a group of highly enlightened yogis which she called the Mahatmas or Masters of the Ancient Wisdom. These Mahatmas, she claimed, were physical beings living in the [[Himalayas]], usually understood as [[Tibet]]:
 {{quote|... they are living men, born as we are born, and doomed to die like every mortal. We call them “masters” because they are our teachers; and because from them we have derived all the Theosophical truths&amp;nbsp;... They are men of great learning, whom we call Initiates, and still greater holiness of life.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, H. P. (1968 [1889]). ''The Key to Theosophy''. London: Theosophical Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After Blavatsky's death in 1891, the concept of the Mahatmas was developed by her successors in the Theosophical Society leadership, [[Annie Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|Charles W. Leadbeater]], who described them in great detail and added [[Master Jesus]] and Maitreya. In Leadbeater's book, ''The Masters and the Path'' (1925), the Masters are presented as human beings full of wisdom and compassion, albeit still limited by human bodies, which they choose to retain in order to keep in touch with humanity and help in its evolution.&lt;ref&gt;See also: ''[[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa#The K.H. Letters to C.W. Leadbeater|K.H. Letters to C.W. Leadbeater]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Later organizations that used many of the teachings of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] for their own purposes, developed concept of Ascended Masters which bears some important differences with the Theosophical one. The ascended master Saint Germain has been releasing the ancient teachings in a more modern and simplified form, as can be found in the books of Peter Mt. Shasta, which show how the Masters can work with those who have an open heart and the desire to benefit humanity.&lt;ref&gt;"Adventures of a Western Mystic: Apprentice to the Masters" (Church of the Seven Rays, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other beliefs about Ascended Masters==
Belief in the Brotherhood and the Masters is an essential part of the beliefs of various organizations that have continued and expanded the concepts released in the original Saint Germain instruction in the 1930s through [["I Am" Activity|The "I AM" Activity]].&lt;ref name="AM Ascended Master Dictation List' 1995"&gt;''I AM Ascended Master Dictation List'', Saint Germain Press Inc., 1995, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.

Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse, and The Temple of The Presence&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of those believed by the ones proposing these teachings to be Ascended Masters would be the Master Jesus, [[Confucius]], [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Mary the Mother of Jesus]], St. [[Paul of Tarsus]], Megha Alcorn as known as Megan Sebastian, [[Ashtar Sheran]], Merku, [[Sanat Kumara]], Aaron as known as Alaje, Aleph, Hatton, (aka [[Master Hilarion|Hilarion]]), [[Melchizedek]], [[Archangel Michael]], [[Metatron]], [[Kuan Yin|Kwan Yin]], St. Germain and [[Kuthumi]], as well as dozens of others.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare. ''Lords of the Seven Rays'', "Profiles of the Ascended Masters", pp. 13-394. Lists more than 250 Ascended Masters.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Unveiled Mysteries'' says:
{{quote|Truly the Great Ascended Masters are Gods. It is no wonder in the mythology of the ancients that their activities have been brought down to us in the guise of myth and fable. They wield Tremendous God Power at all times because they hold with unwavering determination to the Great God Presence and hence all Power is given unto them for they are All-Perfection.&lt;br/&gt;
When Jesus said, 'All these things I have done, ye shall do and even greater things shall ye do,' he knew whereof he spoke," continued Saint Germain. "He came forth to reveal the Conscious Dominion and Mastery that it is possible for every human being to attain and express while still here on Earth.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}}}

==Jesus==
{{Main|Master Jesus}}
Jesus is one of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom in Theosophy and is one of the Ascended masters (also collectively called the [[Great White Brotherhood]]; with white being in reference to the light) in the Ascended Master Teachings, a group of religions based on Theosophy. The Master Jesus is regarded by Theosophists, was regarded by Alice Bailey and was later regarded by students of the "Ascended Master Teachings" as the Master of the [[Seven Rays|Sixth Ray]].&lt;ref name=fire1237&gt;Bailey, Alice A, ''A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' (Section Three - Division A - Certain Basic Statements), 1932, Lucis Trust, 1925, p. 1237.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed by Ascended Master Teachings organizations that the Master Jesus was "Chohan of the Sixth Ray" until December 31, 1959, when, according to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]], Lady Master Nada fully took on that Office in the Spiritual Hierarchy. According to Prophet, Jesus became World Teacher, along with Kuthumi, on January 1, 1956, succeeding Maitreya, who took the Office of "Planetary Buddha" and "Cosmic Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K. ''The Law of Life: Book II'', Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications, 1989; pages 267–272.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana: Summit University Press 1986 page 225&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is not accepted by adherents of traditional Theosophy and the followers of Alice A. Bailey and [[Benjamin Creme]] - they believe that the Master Jesus is still the Chohan of the Sixth Ray and that Maitreya is still the World Teacher.

According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, the [[Prophet]] of the Church Universal and Triumphant, the largest Ascended Master Teachings religion, the Master Jesus incarnated twice as the Emperor of Atlantis, once in 33,050 BC and again in 15,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 142-143&lt;/ref&gt; He did this in order to aid the [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|white magicians]] in the war of the white magicians and the [[black magic]]ians that was going on in [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]] at that time.

According to Alice A. Bailey, the Master Jesus was previously incarnated as [[Joshua]], the Hebrew military leader in the 13th century BC, and [[Joshua the High Priest]] in the sixth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: Lucis Publishing, 1922, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara==
{{Main|Sanat Kumara}}
According to the post-1900 publications of Theosophy (specifically, the writings of [[Charles W. Leadbeater]], Alice A. Bailey, and [[Benjamin Creme]], as well as the Ascended Master Teachings of Guy Ballard, [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]], [[Geraldine Innocente]], [[Joshua David Stone]], and other Ascended Master Teachings teachers), Sanat Kumara&lt;ref&gt;[http://ascension-research.org/sanat.html Sanat Kumara] at ascension-research.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luisprada.com/Protected/a_progress_report_on_our_ascension.htm A Progress Report On Our Ascension] at luisprada.com&lt;/ref&gt; is an "advanced being" of the Ninth Initiation (the highest Initiation possible on planet Earth) who is regarded as the Lord or Regent of [[Earth]] and of [[human race|humanity]], and the head of the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of Earth who dwells in [[Shamballah]], a city said by Theosophists and those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings to be a [[floating city (science fiction)|floating city]] on the [[etheric plane]] above the [[Gobi Desert]].

It is believed by these authors that he is the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, which is composed of Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (Fifth Initiation), Ascended Masters (Sixth Initiation), Chohans and Bodhisattvas (Seventh Initiation), Buddhas (Eighth Initiation), and highly spiritually-evolved volunteers from other worlds, who have all joined together to advance spiritual evolution on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner. ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'', Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004. Describes the founding of Shamballah by Sanat Kumara&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanat Kumara was mentioned briefly  by the theosophist Helena Blavatsky.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna. ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'', Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Sanat Kumara - Volume I: pp. 89, 457–458; Volume II: pp. 106, 140, 319, 584.&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed he belonged to a group of beings, the "Lords of the Flame", whom Christian tradition  have misunderstood as [[Lucifer]] and the fallen angels.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna. ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'', Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Volume II, pp. 243 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanat Kumara gained greater prominence when her follower Charles W. Leadbeater wrote that Sanat Kumara was the "King" or ''Lord of the World'', and the head of the Great White Brotherhood of Mahatmas who had revealed the principles of theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997), pp. 296-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later theosophists such as Alice Bailey and Elizabeth Clare Prophet have embellished the story with further details. He is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy.

==Comparison with Masters of Wisdom==
There is considerable difference between the concept of Masters of the Ancient Wisdom in Theosophy (as described by Blavatsky, [[Henry Steel Olcott|Olcott]], [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Sinnett]], and others) and the current concept of Ascended Masters, developed by Guy Ballard and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] fifty-five years after the [[Theosophical Society]] was founded.

They added more than 200 new "Ascended Masters" that they claimed to receive dictations from in addition to receiving dictations from the original ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom'' of Theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press--See Profiles of the Ascended Masters Pages 13-394--More than 200 Ascended Masters are listed.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ascended Masters, as their name suggests, are supposed to be Masters who have experienced the miracle of ascension, as it is said Jesus did. The original teaching, channeled by Guy Ballard, was that a new Ascended Master would not die but would take the body up with him. This teaching of ascension is in direct opposition to the Theosophical teachings. Mahatma K.H. refers to the idea disparagingly in one of his letters to Sinnett:
{{quote|There was but one hysterical woman alleged to have been present at the pretended ascension, and&amp;nbsp;... the phenomenon has never been corroborated by repetition.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. T., and Vicente Hao Chin Jr., eds. ''The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett from the Mahatmas M. and K. H.'' in Chronological Sequence, p. 5. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Blavatsky also rejects ascension as a fact, calling it "an allegory as old as the world."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Collected Writings vol. 8, p. 389. Wheaton: Theosophical Publishing House, 1977-91; See also CW 4:359-60.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Theosophical view, the Masters of Wisdom retain their physical bodies.

The Masters of the Wisdom are not like the Ascended ones, who are said to become Godlike, all-powerful beings beyond the laws of nature. In their teachings, the Theosophical Masters even denied that such beings exist. Mahatma K.H. wrote:
{{quote|If we had the powers of the imaginary Personal God, and the universal and immutable laws were but toys to play with, then indeed might we have created conditions that would have turned this earth into an Arcadia for lofty souls.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. T; Vicente Hao Chin Jr., eds. ''The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett from the Mahatmas M. and K. H.'' in Chronological Sequence, p. 474. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In their letters, the Mahatmas constantly talk about the "immutable laws" of the universe, and that they can help humanity only within the limits of these laws.

Proponents of the Ascended Masters sometimes attempt to account for these discrepancies by claiming that when the Theosophical Society (TS) was founded most of the Theosophical Mahatmas were still "unascended Masters". This leaves room to detach the Ascended Masters from the limitations. However, the Mahatma K.H. wrote: "We are not infallible, all-foreseeing 'Mahatmas' at every hour of the day."&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. T; Vicente Hao Chin Jr., eds. ''The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett from the Mahatmas M. and K. H.'' in Chronological Sequence, p. 450. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; As he explained: "An adept—the highest as the lowest—is one only during the exercise of his occult powers."&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. T; Vicente Hao Chin Jr., eds. ''The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett from the Mahatmas M. and K. H.'' in Chronological Sequence, p. 257. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, according to the Theosophical teachings, the higher the adept, the less we are likely to hear from him:
{{quote|The more spiritual the Adept becomes, the less can he meddle with mundane, gross affairs and the more he has to confine himself to a spiritual work&amp;nbsp;... The very high Adepts, therefore, do help humanity, but only spiritually: they are constitutionally incapable of meddling with worldly affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, H. P. ''Collected Writings'' vol. 6, p.247. Wheaton: Theosophical Publishing House, 1977-91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the Theosophical view the Masters do not pay attention to personal desires. Theosophy teaches that the psychological ego is false, that the idea that we are this body, emotions, and mind is a mistake of perception and the source of sorrow. It says that real happiness comes only as an unsought by-product of reducing rather than increasing our attachment and identification with the personal. Blavatsky wrote that "Occultism is not . . . the pursuit of happiness as man understands the word; for the first step is sacrifice, the second renunciation."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, H. P. ''Collected Writings'' vol 8, p. 14, Wheaton: Theosophical Publishing House, 1977-91.&lt;/ref&gt; K.H. agreed with this when he wrote: "We—the criticized and misunderstood Brothers—we seek to bring men to sacrifice their personality—a passing flash—for the welfare of the whole humanity."&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. T., and Vicente Hao Chin Jr., eds. The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett from the Mahatmas M. and K. H. in Chronological Sequence, p. 222. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; During the early times of the Theosophical Society, some members, misunderstanding the nature of the Mahatmas, would bring HPB some personal requests to ask of them. In a letter Blavatsky explained:
{{quote|The Masters would not stoop for one moment to give a thought to individual, private matters relating but to one or even ten persons, their welfare, woes and blisses in this world of Maya [illusion], to nothing except questions of really universal importance. It is all you Theosophists who have dragged down in your minds the ideals of our Masters; you who have unconsciously and with the best of intentions and full sincerity of good purpose, desecrated Them, by thinking for one moment, and believing that They would trouble Themselves with your business matters, sons to be born, daughters to be married, houses to be built,&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;C. Jinarajadasa, ''Early Teachings of the Masters'' p. iv. Chicago: Theosophical Press, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This kind of interest is a very marked feature of the Ascended Masters. The Ascended Masters Teachings teach ways to attract material or emotional possessions to a person's life, and also how to dissolve unpleasant karma, a conception that the Theosophical Mahatmas emphatically opposed. For example, K.H. wrote: "Bear in mind that the slightest cause produced, however unconsciously, and with whatever motive, cannot be unmade, or its effects crossed in their progress—by millions of gods, demons, and men combined."&lt;ref&gt;Barker, A. T., and Vicente Hao Chin Jr., eds. ''The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett from the Mahatmas M. and K. H.'' in Chronological Sequence, p. 77-78. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the Ascended Masters are portrayed as cosmic fathers who will take care of their followers' problems. In contrast, Mahatma M. said: "We are leaders but not child-nurses."&lt;ref&gt;Eek, Sven, ed. ''Damodar and the Pioneers of the Theosophical Movement'', p. 605. Adyar: Theosophical Publishing House, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maitreya==
{{Main|Maitreya (Theosophy)}}
''Maitri'' is Sanskrit for "loving kindness." The [[Gautama Buddha|historical Buddha]] was reported to have said near the time of his death in the 4th century BCE that many Buddhas (awakened ones) had come before him, and that in the future another Buddha would come who would be greater than him, and who would embody "Maitri." This prophecy created the expectation of a Buddha Maitreya, which was probably fulfilled in the advent of the being now called "Jesus," likely Apollonius of Tyanna, who on his travels in India and the Far East was reported in many texts to have been called, "Issa," probably short for "Rishi" (great sage). His teachings embody that principal of loving kindness. ''Maitreya'' or ''Lord Maitreya'' is described in Theosophical literature of the late 19th-century and subsequent periods as an advanced spiritual entity and high-ranking member of a hidden Spiritual Hierarchy, the so-called ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom''. According to Theosophical [[doctrine]], one of the Hierarchy's functions is to oversee the evolution of Humankind; in accord with this function Maitreya is said to hold the so-called ''Office of the World Teacher''. Theosophical texts posit that the purpose of this Office is to facilitate the transfer of knowledge about the true constitution and workings of Existence. Humanity is thereby assisted on its presumed cyclical, but ever progressive, [[Evolution (term)|evolutionary]] path. Reputedly, one way the knowledge transfer is accomplished is by Maitreya occasionally manifesting or [[Incarnation|incarnating]] in the physical realm; the manifested entity then assumes the role of World Teacher of Humankind.

The Theosophical concept of Maitreya has many similarities to the earlier [[Maitreya]] doctrine in [[Buddhism]]. However, they differ in important aspects, and developed differently. The Theosophical Maitreya has been assimilated or appropriated by a variety of quasi-theosophical and non-theosophical [[New Age]] and [[Esoteric]] groups and movements. These have added, and advanced, their own interpretations and commentary on the subject.

=== {{anchor|dev}} Development of the concept ===
The first mention of Maitreya in a Theosophical context occurs in the 1883 work [[Esoteric Buddhism (book)|''Esoteric Buddhism'']] by [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]] (1840&amp;ndash;1921), an early Theosophical writer. The concepts described by Sinnett were amended, elaborated on, and greatly expanded in ''The Secret Doctrine'', a book originally published 1888. The work was the [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] of Helena Blavatsky, one of the physical founders of the [[Theosophical Society]] and of contemporary Theosophy. In it, the [[Messianism|messianic]] Maitreya is linked to both Buddhist and [[Hindu]] religious traditions. In the same work Blavatsky was to assert that there have been, and will be, multiple messianic (or messianic-like) instances in human history. These successive appearances of "emissarie{{interp|s}} of Truth" are according to the Blavatsky writings part of the unceasing oversight of Earth and of its inhabitants by a physically hidden Spiritual Hierarchy, called ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom''. The Theosophist, ""Alice Bailey,"" who broke with the Indian branch of the [[Theosophical Society]], and who was heavily influenced by orthodox Christianity, started the expectation that the ""Maitreya" would actually be reborn on the earth  as a physical being, fulfilling the Christian ideal of a [[Second Coming]], rather than the [[New Age]] ideal of the Christ being reborn in the heart of each individual.

==Initiation==
Initiation is a concept in Theosophy that there are nine levels of spiritual development that beings who live on [[Earth]] can progress upward through.  Within these levels, there are four basic levels of spiritual development that [[human being]]s on [[Earth]] progress through as they [[Reincarnation|reincarnate]], although [[evil]] acts may cause bad [[karma]] which may cause one to temporarily regress. It is believed{{By whom|date=August 2013}} that when [[soul]]s have advanced to the fourth level of initiation, they have reached [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and have no further need to reincarnate.  At the fifth level of initiation and beyond, souls  have the opportunity to become members of the Spiritual Hierarchy.  This concept was developed by both [[C.W. Leadbeater]] and Alice A. Bailey beginning in the 1920s.
  
According to C.W. Leadbeater, Initiation is a process by which "we try to develop ourselves not that we may become great and wise, but that we may have the power and knowledge to work for humanity to the best effect."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Leadbeater, Charles W. ''The Masters and the Path'', Adyar, Madras, India, Theosophical Publishing House, 1925, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alice A. Bailey, ''Initiation'' is the "process of undergoing an [[Higher consciousness|expansion [toward higher levels] of consciousness]]"&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: Lucis Publishing, 1922, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed by Theosophists that all [[soul]]s that have reached the fourth level of initiation and evolved beyond the necessity to [[reincarnate]]. Those who do not elect to become [[pratyeka buddha]]s and go directly into Spiritual Hierarchy governing [[nirvana]], gradually evolving upward through all of these six higher levels of consciousness over thousands or millions of years, and later over billions or trillions of years, with other higher levels beyond.

The concept of Initiation is also recognized in the Ascended Master Teachings, a group of religions based on Theosophy. In the Ascended Master Teachings, the Sixth Initiation is referred to as ''Ascension''. The first six initiations were named by Charles W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey after the six most important events in the life of [[Jesus]]

==The Great White Brotherhood==
The [[Great White Brotherhood]], in belief systems akin to [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|Theosophical]] and [[New Age]], are said to be supernatural beings of great power who spread spiritual teachings through selected humans.&lt;ref name="barrett"&gt;{{cite book |title= Sects, 'Cults', and Alternative Religions: A World Survey and Sourcebook|last= Barrett|first= David|year= 1996|publisher= Blandford|location= London|isbn= 0-7137-2567-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the Brotherhood may be known as the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom or the Ascended masters.&lt;ref name="barrett" /&gt; Various people have said they have received messages from these beings, including most notably [Helena Blavatsky (Theosophy), [[Aleister Crowley]] ([[Thelema]]), Alice A. Bailey ([[New Group of World Servers]]), Guy Ballard ([["I AM" Activity]]), Geraldine Innocente (The Bridge to Freedom), [[Mark L. Prophet]] &amp; [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] (Church Universal and Triumphant) and [[Benjamin Creme]] ([[Share International]]).&lt;ref name="barrett" /&gt;

The Masters are collectively called the "Great White Brotherhood" by various theosophists and esotericists. The use of the term "white" refers to their advanced spirituality (in other words, that they have a white colored 
[[Aura (paranormal)|aura]]) and has nothing to do with race. Blavatsky described many of the Masters as ethnically [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] or [[India]]n ([[Hindu]]), not [[European ethnic groups|European]].&lt;ref&gt;Sinnett, Alfred Percy. ''[[s:The Occult World/Occultism and Its Adepts#Page 24|The Occult World]]''. Boston: Colby &amp; Rich, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; She did, however, describe them as being from all cultures and races, such as the "Greek gentleman" known as [[Master Hilarion|Hilarion]].&lt;ref name="enigma"&gt;Sisson, Marina Cesar. [http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/sisson1.htm ''Helena Blavatsky and the Enigma of John King'']; originally published as ''Informativo HPB'', No. 3, 4 and 5 English translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Belief in the Brotherhood and the Masters is an essential part of the [[syncretism|syncretistic]] teachings of various organizations that have taken the Theosophical philosophical concepts and added their own elements.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, Gordon J.; Partridge, Christopher. ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities'', Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of those believed to be Ascended Masters by these organizations are: Jesus, Sanat Kumara, [[Gautama Buddha]], Maitreya, [[Confucius]], [[Duke of Chou|Lord Lanto]] (Confucius' historical mentor), [[Mary (mother of Jesus)]], Lady Master Nada, [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], [[Kuan Yin|Kwan Yin]], Saint Germain, and Kuthumi, to name but a few.&lt;ref name="AM Ascended Master Dictation List' 1995"/&gt; It is believed that all of these put aside any differences they might have had in their Earthly careers, and unite instead to advance the spiritual well-being of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great White Brotherhood in the Culture, History and Religion of America''. Summit University Press, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dictations==
Within "The I AM Activity" (founded by Guy Warren Ballard in the early 1930s), contact and cooperation with the Ascended Masters became a central part of each member's life. Through the Ballards as "Messengers", the Ascended Masters were believed to have regularly communicated with the students of "The I AM Activity." Those Addresses (known as "Dictations") were delivered before gatherings of members in Conclaves held throughout the United States of America, and published in the monthly periodical ''The Voice of The "I AM"'', and some were collected and reprinted in the "green books" of ''The Saint Germain Series''. In all, 3,834 Dictations from the Masters were received through Guy and Edna Ballard. Other "Ascended Master Activities" believed that the Ascended Masters, Cosmic Beings, Elohim, and Archangels continued to present a program for both individual development and spiritual transformation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Christopher ed. ''New Religions: A Guide: New Religious Movements, Sects and Alternative Spiritualities'' Oxford University Press, USA 2004. Describes the religious organizations based on a belief in the Ascended Master Teachings, such as The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom and The Summit Lighthouse. pages 330 - 334&lt;/ref&gt; They believe that further instruction from the Ascended Masters and the rest of the Spiritual Hierarchy continued through new Dispensations with new Messengers, such as The Bridge to Freedom,&lt;ref&gt;''The Bridge to Freedom Journal'' 1951 - 1961 Reprinted by Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The Summit Lighthouse, and The Temple of The Presence.

==The Aquarian Church==
The Aquarian Christine Church Universal, Inc. (ACCU) is a denomination founded in 2006 based on ''The [[Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ]]'' transcribed from the [[Akashic records|Akashic Records]] by [[Levi Dowling|Levi H. Dowling]]. The Aquarian Christine Church actively promotes Ascended Master Teachings and shares many beliefs in common with the I AM Movement, White Eagle Lodge and New Thought and Theosophical groups.  The book "Initiations of the Aquarian Masters: The Theosophy of the Aquarian Gospel" by ACCU founder Jacob L. Watson, expounds on the church's teachings which draw heavily from the writings of A.D.K. Luk (pen-name of Alice Beulah  Schutz) (April 10, 1905 - Jan. 14, 1994), the Saint Germain Series published by the Saint Germain Press (The Saint Germain Foundation), and especially from "The Lost Years of Jesus" compiled by Elizabeth Clare Prophet and published by The Summit Lighthouse.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Jacob L. "Initiations of the Aquarian Masters: The Theosophy of the Aquarian Gospel"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==
[[René Guénon]] wrote a detailed critique of Theosophy titled ''Theosophy: history of a pseudo-religion'' (1921). In the book Guenon speculated that Blavatsky had acquired all her knowledge naturally from other books not from any supernatural masters. Guenon points out that Blavatsky spent a long time visiting a library at New York where she had easy access to the works of [[Jacob Boehme]], [[Eliphas Levi]], the [[Kabbalah|Kabbala]] and other [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] treatises. Guenon also speculated that Blavatsky had borrowed passages from extracts of the ''[[Kanjur]]'' and ''[[Tanjur]]'', translated by the eccentric orientalist [[Sándor Kőrösi Csoma]], published in 1836 in the twentieth volume of the ''Asiatic Researchers of Calcutta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=René |last1= Guénon |others= Alvin Moore, Jr. and Cecil Bethell (trans.)| title = Theosophy: history of a pseudo-religion | year=2004 | pages= 82–89 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7_WwVFntyFwC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[K. Paul Johnson]] suggests in his book ''The Masters Revealed: Madam Blavatsky and Myth of the Great White Brotherhood'' that the Masters that Madam Blavatsky claimed she had personally met are idealizations of certain people she had met during her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, K. Paul. ''The Masters Revealed: Madam Blavatsky and Myth of the Great White Brotherhood'', Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Also see the article “Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements” by Paul Zweig ''New York Times'' October 5, 1980, which speculates that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, Paul. “Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements”, ''The New York Times'', 5 October 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Todd Carroll]] in his book ''The skeptic's dictionary'' (2003) speculates that Blavatsky used trickery into deceiving others into thinking she had paranormal powers. Carroll further speculates that Blavatsky had faked a materialization of a tea cup and saucer as well as written the messages from her masters herself.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Robert Todd. ''The skeptic's dictionary'', 2003, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association for Civil Rights in Israel''' (ACRI) ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|האגודה לזכויות האזרח בישראל}}; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|جمعية حقوق المواطن في اسرائيل}}) was created in 1972&lt;ref name="founded"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/to-each-his-own-justice-1.224169|title=To Each His Own Justice|publisher= Ha'aretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an independent, non-partisan [[not-for-profit organization]] with the mission of protecting [[human rights]] and [[civil rights]] in [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian territories| territories]] under its control. ACRI is Israel’s oldest and largest human rights organization. Headquartered in [[Tel Aviv]], with offices in [[Jerusalem]], [[Nazareth]] and [[Be'er Sheva]], the organization promotes transparency and accountability in government.&lt;ref&gt;International Network of Civil Liberties Organizations, "[https://www.inclo.net/members/acri.html The Association for Civil Rights in Israel]," retrieved 9 May 2018&lt;/ref&gt; 

ACRI has been accused by critics, including former Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]], of defending terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=האגודה לזכויות האדם יוצאת מהקונסנסוס|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/1.789329|date=25 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Established in 1972, ACRI views itself as being "committed to promoting the universality of human rights and defending the human rights and civil liberties of all, regardless of religion, nationality, gender, ethnicity, political affiliation, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic background."&lt;ref name="mission"/&gt;  The association established its views based on the basic rights recognized in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1948, and the values in [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In 1981, ACRI instituted a human rights award to be given to "individuals and organizations that have made a outstanding contribution to the advancement of [[human rights]] in [[Israel]]". The award was renamed in 1983 as the "[[Emil Grunzweig Human Rights Award]]."&lt;ref name="award"&gt;The Association For Civil Rights in Israel. ''The Emil Grunzweig Human Rights Award: The First 30 Years 1981-2011''. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, ACRI organized what has become an annual "Human Rights March" to mark [[International Human Rights Day]] (December 10) in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref name="march1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=293479|date=November 26, 2012|title=Thousands expected at fourth annual Human Rights March|newspaper=Jerusalem Post|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130020813/http://www.jpost.com/Headlines/Article.aspx?id=293479|archive-date=30 November 2012|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACRI’s Legal Department argues cases before the [[Supreme Court of Israel]], and also seeks redress before district and labor courts, government ministries, and [[Knesset]] committees.

ACRI’s Education Department conducts human rights training programs, produces educational curricula in [[Hebrew]] and [[Arabic]], and organizes conferences and lectures on human rights education. Additionally, ACRI operates a program on [[International Humanitarian Law]] (IHL) and offers IHL educational workshops to [[Activism| social activists]], students, educators, youth movement counselors, and students at pre-military academies to "enhance the participants’ knowledge of IHL, and to provide opportunities for discussion and for developing their positions on the issues involved."

ACRI publishes reports and information leaflets; organizes lectures, conferences, film screenings and other public and community events covering a wide range of human rights issues; and runs a public hotline to assist people whose rights have been infringed.

Internationally, ACRI submits shadow reports and provides information to UN committees and representatives regarding Israel’s compliance with its human rights obligations; meets with foreign diplomats and government representatives; participates in international conferences and NGO networks; and raises awareness of human rights issues by generating ongoing international media coverage.

ACRI focus on issues pertaining to Arab Minority Rights, Anti-Democratic Initiatives, Freedom of Expression, LGBT Rights, [[East Jerusalem]], Human Rights Defenders in the [[Occupied Palestinian Territories]] (OPT), Migrant Workers, Child Rights, [[Negev Bedouins]], [[Refugees]] and [[Asylum Seekers]], Right to Health, Women's Rights, and the Right to Housing.&lt;ref name="issues"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acri.org.il/en/all-issues/|title=All Issues|publisher=Association for Civil Rights in Israel|accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Though ACRI does not identify itself politically, activities of the association has been criticized as assisting organizations that harm Israel's [[national security]]. Such criticism was made by prime-minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] over an appeal about exiling 400 [[Hamas]] activists to [[Lebanon]] in 1992. Rabin Called ACRI - "Association for Rights of Hamas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=האגודה לזכויות האדם יוצאת מהקונסנסוס|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/1.789329|date=25 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other right-wing activists have called it "Association for Palestinian Civil Rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=הצד ההומניסטי של האנטישמיות - בגליון השבוע|url=http://www.inn.co.il/Besheva/Article.aspx/2454|date=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Education Minister [[Naftali Bennett]] cancelled a conference to be held in cooperation with ACRI following a letter sent by a group of bereaved families accusing ACRI of defending [[terrorism| terrorists]]. ACRI denied the allegations and stated that it does not defend terrorists during their criminal proceedings, rather only in regards to their rights in prison and matters of citizenship and residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israeli Minister Axes Workshop With Biggest Civil Rights Group Over Claim It 'Defends Terrorists'|url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.825541|website=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Emil Grunzweig human rights award ==

The [[Emil Grunzweig Human Rights Award]] is awarded annually by Association for Civil Rights in Israel to "individuals and organizations that have made a outstanding contribution to the advancement of [[human rights]] in [[Israel]]". The award was established in 1981 as an initiative by Professor Jacob Lorch, but was renamed in 1983 after the murder of activist [[Emil Grunzweig]] by a grenade thrown by a right-wing Israeli extremist during a [[Peace Now]] demonstration against the [[1982 Lebanon war|war in Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="award"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3509">In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], '''axiality and rhombicity''' are two characteristics of a [[symmetric tensor|symmetric]] second-rank [[tensor]] in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], describing its directional asymmetry. 

Let ''A'' denote a second-rank tensor in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which can be represented by a 3-by-3 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. We assume that ''A'' is symmetric. This implies that ''A'' has three real [[eigenvalue]]s, which we denote by &lt;math&gt;A_{{xx}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A_{{yy}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_{{zz}}&lt;/math&gt;. We assume that they are ordered such that 
:&lt;math&gt;A_{{xx}} \le A_{{yy}} \le A_{{zz}}.&lt;/math&gt; 

The axiality of ''A'' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta A =2 A_{zz}-(A_{xx}+A_{yy}). \, &lt;/math&gt;
The rhombicity is the difference between the smallest and the second-smallest eigenvalue:
:&lt;math&gt; \delta A = A_{yy}-A_{xx}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

Other definitions of axiality and rhombicity differ from the ones given above by constant factors which depend on the context. For example, when using them as parameters in the irreducible spherical tensor expansion, it is most convenient to divide the above definition of axiality by &lt;math&gt;{\sqrt{6}}&lt;/math&gt; and that of rhombicity by &lt;math&gt;{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==
The description of physical interactions in terms of '''axiality and rhombicity''' is frequently encountered in [[Spin (physics)|spin]] dynamics and, in particular, in [[Spin (physics)|spin]] relaxation theory, where many traceless bilinear interaction Hamiltonians, having the (eigenframe) form

:&lt;math&gt; \hat H = \hat\vec\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{A}\cdot\hat\vec\mathbf{b} = A_{xx} \hat a_{x} \hat b_{x} + A_{yy} \hat a_{y} \hat b_{y} + A_{zz} \hat a_{z} \hat b_{z} &lt;/math&gt;

(hats denote spin projection operators) may be conveniently rotated using rank 2 irreducible spherical tensor operators:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat\vec\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{A}\cdot\hat\vec\mathbf{b} = \frac{\delta A}{2} \hat T_{2,-2} + \frac{\delta A}{2} \hat T_{2,2} + \frac{\Delta A}{\sqrt{6}} \hat T_{2,-2} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \hat \hat R_{\alpha,\beta,\gamma} (\hat T_{l,m}) =  \sum_{k=-2}^2 \hat T_{l,k} \mathfrak{D}_{k,m}^{(l)}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{D}_{k,m}^{(l)}(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)&lt;/math&gt; are Wigner functions, &lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)&lt;/math&gt; are Euler angles, and the expressions for the rank 2 irreducible spherical tensor operators are:

:&lt;math&gt; \hat T_{2,2} = + \frac{1}{2} \hat a_{+} \hat b_{+} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \hat T_{2,1} = - \frac{1}{2}( \hat a_{z} \hat b_{+} + \hat a_{+} \hat b_{z} ) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \hat T_{2,0} = + \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}( \hat a_{z} \hat b_{z} - \frac{1}{4}( \hat a_{+} \hat b_{-} + \hat a_{-} \hat b_{+}) ) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \hat T_{2,-1} = + \frac{1}{2}( \hat a_{z} \hat b_{-} + \hat a_{-} \hat b_{z} ) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \hat T_{2,-2} = + \frac{1}{2} \hat a_{-} \hat b_{-} &lt;/math&gt;

Defining Hamiltonian rotations in this way (axiality, rhombicity, three angles) significantly simplifies calculations, since the properties of Wigner functions are well understood.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6324">In [[mathematics]], a '''cover''' of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a collection of sets whose union contains &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as a [[subset]]. Formally, if
:&lt;math&gt;C = \lbrace U_\alpha: \alpha \in A\rbrace&lt;/math&gt;
is an [[indexed family]] of sets &lt;math&gt;U_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a cover of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if
:&lt;math&gt;X \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha \in A}U_{\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Cover in topology==
Covers are commonly used in the context of [[topology]]. If the set ''X'' is a [[topological space]], then a ''cover'' ''C'' of ''X'' is a collection of subsets ''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; of ''X'' whose union is the whole space ''X''. In this case we say that ''C'' ''covers'' ''X'', or that the sets ''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; ''cover'' ''X''. Also, if ''Y'' is a subset of ''X'', then a ''cover'' of ''Y'' is a collection of subsets of ''X'' whose union contains ''Y'', i.e., ''C'' is a cover of ''Y'' if

:&lt;math&gt;Y \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha \in C}U_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''C'' be a cover of a topological space ''X''. A '''subcover''' of ''C'' is a subset of ''C'' that still covers ''X''.

We say that ''C'' is an '''{{vanchor|open cover}}''' if each of its members is an [[open set]] (i.e. each ''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is contained in ''T'', where ''T'' is the topology on ''X'').

A cover of ''X'' is said to be [[locally finite collection|locally finite]] if every point of ''X'' has a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] which intersects only [[finite set|finite]]ly many sets in the cover.  Formally, ''C'' = {''U''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;} is locally finite if for any ''x'' ∈ ''X'', there exists some neighborhood ''N''(''x'') of ''x'' such that the set
:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \alpha \in A : U_{\alpha} \cap N(x) \neq \varnothing \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
is finite. A cover of ''X'' is said to be '''point finite''' if every point of ''X'' is contained in only finitely many sets in the cover. A cover is point finite if it is locally finite, though the converse is not necessarily true.

==Refinement==
A '''refinement''' of a cover ''C'' of a topological space ''X'' is a new cover ''D'' of ''X'' such that every set in ''D'' is contained in some set in ''C''. Formally,
:&lt;math&gt;D = \{V_{\beta \in B}\} \; \text{is a refinement of} \; C = \{U_{\alpha \in A}\} \; \text{when} \; \forall \beta \ \exists \alpha \ V_\beta \subseteq U_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

In other words, there is a '''refinement map''' &lt;math&gt;\phi: B \rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;V_{\beta} \subseteq U_{\phi(\beta)}&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;\beta \in B&lt;/math&gt;. This map is used, for instance, in the  [[Čech cohomology]] of X.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology|date = 1982|last = Bott, Tu|page = 111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every subcover is also a refinement, but the opposite is not always true. A subcover is made from the sets that are in the cover, but omitting some of them; whereas a refinement is made from any sets that are subsets of the sets in the cover.

The refinement relation is a [[preorder]] on the set of covers of ''X''.

Generally speaking, a refinement of a given structure is another that in some sense contains it. Examples are to be found when partitioning an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] (one refinement of &lt;math&gt;a_0 &lt; a_1 &lt; ... &lt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; being &lt;math&gt;a_0 &lt; b_0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; ... &lt; a_n &lt; b_1&lt;/math&gt;), considering [[topology|topologies]] (the [[standard topology]] in euclidean space being a refinement of the [[trivial topology]]). When subdividing [[simplicial complex]]es (the first [[barycentric subdivision]] of a simplicial complex is a refinement), the situation is slightly different: every [[simplex]] in the finer complex is a face of some simplex in the coarser one, and both have equal underlying polyhedra.

Yet another notion of refinement is that of [[star refinement]].

==Subcover==
A simple way to get a subcover is to omit the sets contained in another set in the cover. Turn to open cover.
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; be the topological basis of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}=\{A\in\mathcal{B},A\subset U \}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is any set in an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is indeed a refinement. For any &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, we select a &lt;math&gt;U_A\in\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; (require the selection axiom). Now &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}=\{U_A\in\mathcal{O},A\subset U_A \}&lt;/math&gt; is a subcover of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the cardinal of a subcover of an open cover can be as small as that of  topological basis. And second countability implies Lindelöf spaces.

==Compactness==
The language of covers is often used to define several topological properties related to ''compactness''. A topological space ''X'' is said to be
;[[compact space|Compact]]: if every open cover has a finite subcover, (or equivalently that every open cover has a finite refinement);
;[[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]]: if every open cover has a [[countable]] subcover, (or equivalently that every open cover has a countable refinement);
;[[metacompact space|Metacompact]]: if every open cover has a point finite open refinement;
;[[paracompact space|Paracompact]]: if every open cover admits a locally finite open refinement.

For some more variations see the above articles.

==Covering dimension==
A topological space ''X'' is said to be of [[covering dimension]] ''n'' if every open cover of ''X'' has a point finite open refinement such that no point of ''X'' is included in more than ''n+1'' sets in the refinement and if ''n'' is the minimum value for which this is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{Tort law}} 
In [[Tort|tort law]], a '''duty of care''' is a [[Law|legal]] [[Law of obligations|obligation]] which is imposed on an individual requiring adherence to a [[standard of care|standard]] of [[Reasonable person|reasonable]] care while performing any acts that could foreseeably harm others. It is the first element that must be established to proceed with an action in [[negligence]]. The claimant must [[Cause of action|be able to show]] a duty of care imposed by law which the defendant has breached. In turn, breaching a [[duty]] may subject an individual to liability. The duty of care may be imposed ''by [[operation of law]]'' between individuals with no ''current'' direct relationship (familial or contractual or otherwise), but eventually become related in some manner, as defined by [[common law]] (meaning case law).

Duty of care may be considered a formalisation of the [[social contract]], the implicit responsibilities held by individuals towards others within [[society]]. It is not a requirement that a duty of care be defined by law, though it will often develop through the [[jurisprudence]] of [[common law]].

==Development of the ''general'' duty of care==
At common law, duties were formerly limited to those with whom one was in [[privity]] one way or another, as exemplified by cases like ''[[Winterbottom v. Wright]]'' (1842). In the early 20th century, judges began to recognize that the cold realities of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] (in which end users were frequently several parties removed from the original manufacturer) implied that enforcing the privity requirement against hapless consumers had harsh results in many [[product liability]] cases.  The idea of a general duty of care that runs to all who could be foreseeably affected by one's conduct (accompanied by the demolishing of the privity barrier) first appeared in the judgment of [[William Brett, 1st Viscount Esher|William Brett (later Lord Esher)]], [[Master of the Rolls]], in ''[[Heaven v Pender]]'' (1883). Although Brett's formulation was rejected by the rest of the court, similar formulations later appeared in the landmark U.S. case of ''[[MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.]]'' (1916) and, in the UK, in ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' (1932).  Both ''MacPherson'' and ''Donoghue'' were product liability cases, and both expressly acknowledged and cited Brett's analysis as their inspiration.

==Scope==
Although the duty of care is easiest to understand in contexts like simple [[blunt trauma]], it is important to understand that the duty can be still found in situations where plaintiffs and defendants may be separated by vast distances of space and time.

For instance, an engineer or construction company involved in erecting a building may be reasonably responsible to tenants inhabiting the building many years in the future. This point is illustrated by the decision of the [[South Carolina Supreme Court]] in ''Terlinde v. Neely'' 275 S.C. 395, 271 S.E.2d 768 (1980), later cited by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in ''Winnipeg Condominium Corporation No. 36 v. Bird Construction Co.'' [1995] 1 S.C.R. 85:
{{bquote|The plaintiffs, being a member of the class for which the home was constructed, are entitled to a duty of care in construction commensurate with industry standards. In the light of the fact that the home was constructed as speculative, the home builder cannot reasonably argue he envisioned anything but a class of purchasers. By placing this product into the stream of commerce, the builder owes a duty of care to those who will use his product, so as to render him accountable for negligent workmanship.}}

==Responsibility==
Although the idea of a general duty of care is now widely accepted, there are significant differences among the [[common law]] jurisdictions concerning the specific circumstances under which that duty of care exists. Obviously, courts cannot impose unlimited liability and hold everyone liable for everyone else's problems; as [[Benjamin Cardozo|Justice Cardozo]] put it, to rule otherwise would be to expose defendants "to a liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ultramares Corporation v. Touche]]'', 255 N.Y. 170, 174 N.E. 441 (1931).&lt;/ref&gt;  There must be some reasonable limit to the duty of care; the problem is where to set that limit.

===England===
{{main article|Duty of care in English law}}

The question whether a duty of care exists depends firstly on whether there is an analogous case in which the Courts have previously held there to exist (or not exist) a duty of care; and, if there is no analogous case, what the particular court deciding the case at issue itself thinks about whether a duty of care exists. Situations in which a duty of care have previously been held to exist include doctor and patient, manufacturer and consumer &lt;ref&gt; Donoghue, infra &lt;/ref&gt;, and surveyor and mortgagor &lt;ref&gt; Smith v. Eric S Bush, [1990] 1 AC 831 &lt;/ref&gt;.

Accordingly, if there is an analogous case on duty of care, the court will simply apply that case to the facts of the new case without asking itself any normative question &lt;ref&gt; Robinson v. Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police, [2018] UKSC 4 &lt;/ref&gt; . It is only if there is no similar case that the court will then go onto apply the normative criteria which Lord Bridge of Harwich sets out in ''[[Caparo Industries plc v Dickman]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Caparo Industries plc v Dickman'' [1990] 2 AC 605&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[House of Lords]] set out the following three-part test:

* Harm must be a "reasonably foreseeable" result of the defendant's conduct;&lt;ref name="Donoghue v Stevenson"&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Donoghue v Stevenson]] |court=UKHL |year=1932 |num=100 |parallelcite=[1932] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 562 |courtname=auto |date=26 May 1932}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|260|2015|litigants=Wormleaton v Thomas &amp; Coffey Limited (No 4) |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|46|1961|litigants=Chapman v Hearse |parallelcite=(1961) 106 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 112 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|169|2015|litigants=Endeavour Energy v Precision Helicopters Pty Ltd |parallelcite= |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A relationship of "proximity" must exist between the defendant and the claimant;
* It must be "fair, just and reasonable" to impose liability.

===Australia===
The High Court of Australia has deviated from the British approach, which still recognises a proximity element. Rather, Australian law first determines whether the case at hand fits within an established category of case where a duty of care has been found.&lt;ref name="Perre v Apand"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|36|1999|litigants=Perre v Apand |parallelcite= (1999) 198 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 180 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p 217}} For example, occupiers of a premises automatically owe a duty of care to any person on their premises.&lt;ref name="Safeway Stores v Zaluzna"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|7|1987|litigants=Safeway Stores v Zaluzna |parallelcite= (1987) 162 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 479 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

If this is not the case, then the plaintiff must prove that it was reasonably foreseeable that harm could result from the defendant's actions. If so, the Court then applies a 'salient features' test to determine whether the plaintiff is owed a duty of care.&lt;ref name="Perre v Apand"/&gt; Some of the salient features which the Court considers in making this inquiry include:
# Whether imposition of a duty of care would lead to 'indeterminate liability' – that is, it would interfere with the legitimate protection or pursuit of an individual's social or business interests.&lt;ref name="Perre v Apand"/&gt;{{rp|p 219-20}}
# Whether imposition of a duty would constitute an unreasonable burden on individual autonomy.&lt;ref name="Perre v Apand"/&gt;{{rp|p 223-5}}
# The degree of vulnerability of the plaintiff to the defendant's actions – their ability to guard against the harm.&lt;ref name="Perre v Apand"/&gt;{{rp|p 225-6}}
# The degree of knowledge which the defendant had about the probability and likely magnitude of harm to the plaintiff.&lt;ref name="Perre v Apand"/&gt;{{rp|p 230-1}}
Special rules exist for the establishment of duty of care where the plaintiff suffered mental harm, or where the defendant is a public authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act||Civil Liability Act 2002}} sections 27–33; 41–45.&lt;/ref&gt; 

To establish a duty of care, the plaintiff has to satisfy the requirement of CLA Act ss 27-33. In light of this, a large number of individuals cannot claim injuries as well. Meanwhile, compared to the ‘No-Fault Compensation’ system in New Zealand, the cost to claim injuries is much higher. In light of this, individuals especially the victims who lack knowledge or capability may choose not claim private nuisance after balancing the burden and outcomes. This view affirmed by Regina Graycar, he states that the courts in Australia are reluctant to award damages for personal injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Regina Graycar, ‘Love’s Labour’s Cost: The High Court Decision in Van Gervan v Fenton’ (1993) 1 Torts Law Journal 122,136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In New South Wales, a plaintiff is able to recover for non-economic loss, including pain and suffering, loss of amenities/expectation of life and disfigurement, upon the severity of the loss being at least 15% of 'most extreme case'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act||Civil Liability Act 2002|16}}(1).&lt;/ref&gt;
As of October 2016, NSW Attorney General, Gabrielle Upton, has updated the maximum amount of damages for non-economic loss from $594,000 to $605,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Civil Liability (Non-economic Loss) Amendment Order'' 2016 (NSW) |url=https://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/regulation/2010/606/whole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
On 27 March 2017, the French [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] adopted a law entitled “Devoir de vigilance des entreprises donneuses d'ordre”, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/dossiers/devoir_vigilance_entreprises_donneuses_ordre.asp Entreprises : devoir de vigilance des entreprises donneuses d'ordre], published 28 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; whose title has been translated into English as a "duty of vigilance" or "duty of care".&lt;ref&gt;Ethical Trading Initiative, [http://www.ethicaltrade.org/blog/france-adopts-new-corporate-duty-care-law France adopts new corporate “duty of care” law], 1 March 2017, accessed 7 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The law will oblige large [[French companies]] (companies with at least 5,000 staff in France or 10,000 staff within their combined French and foreign offices over two consecutive years) &lt;ref&gt;Norton Rose Fulbright, [http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/knowledge/publications/147606/a-new-duty-of-care-for-the-most-significant-companies-in-france A new duty of care for the most significant companies in France], accessed 7 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; to:
:"Establish and implement a diligence plan which should state the measures taken to identify and prevent the occurrence of human rights and environmental risks resulting from their activities, the activities of companies they control and the activities of [[sub-contractor]]s and suppliers on whom they have a significant influence."&lt;ref&gt;Ethical Trading Initiative, [http://www.ethicaltrade.org/blog/france-adopts-new-corporate-duty-care-law France adopts new corporate “duty of care” law], 1 March 2017, accessed 7 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Because each of the 50 [[U.S. state]]s is a separate [[States' rights|sovereign]] free to develop its own tort law under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]], there are several tests for finding a duty of care in [[United States tort law]].

====Foreseeability test====
In several states, like [[Florida]] and [[Massachusetts]], the sole test is whether the harm to the plaintiff from the defendant's actions was foreseeable.&lt;ref&gt;''McCain v. Florida Power Corp.'', 593 So. 2d 500, 503 (Fla. 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Jupin v. Kask'', 849 N.E.2d 829, 835 (Mass. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multi-factor test====
The [[Supreme Court of California]], in a [[majority opinion]] by Justice [[David Eagleson]], criticized the idea that foreseeability, standing alone, constitutes an adequate basis on which to rest the duty of care: "Experience has shown that . . . there are clear judicial days on which a court can foresee forever and thus determine liability but none on which that foresight alone provides a socially and judicially acceptable limit on recovery of damages."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Thing v. La Chusa]]'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C3/48C3d644.htm 48 Cal. 3d 644, 667] (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing upon the work of scholars such as Fowler V. Harper, Fleming James Jr., and [[William Prosser (academic)|William Prosser]], [[California]] has developed a complicated [[balancing test]] consisting of multiple factors which must be carefully weighed against one another to determine whether a duty of care exists in a negligence action.

[[California Civil Code]] section 1714 imposes a general duty of ordinary care, which by default requires all persons to take reasonable measures to prevent harm to others.&lt;ref name="51 Cal.4th 764"&gt;Cabral v. Ralphs [http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/cabral-v-ralphs-grocery-33956 51 Cal.4th 764] (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1968 case of ''[[Rowland v. Christian]]'', the court held that judicial exceptions to this general duty of care should only be created if clearly justified based on the following public-policy factors:

*the foreseeability of harm to the injured party;
*the degree of certainty he or she suffered injury;
*the closeness of the connection between the defendant’s conduct and the injury suffered;
*the moral blame attached to the defendant’s conduct;
*the policy of preventing future harm;
*the extent of the burden to the defendant and the consequences to the community of imposing a duty of care with resulting liability for breach;
*and the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.&lt;ref name="69 Cal. 2d 108"&gt;''Rowland v. Christian'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C2/69C2d108.htm 69 Cal. 2d 108] (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;
A 1997 case added to this:

*the social utility of the defendant's conduct from which the injury arose.&lt;ref&gt;''Parsons v. Crown Disposal Co.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C4/15C4t456.htm 15 Cal. 4th 456] (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary California appellate decisions treat the ''Rowland'' decision as the "gold standard" for determining the existence of a legal duty of care, and generally refer to the criteria for determining the existence of a legal duty of care as the ''Rowland'' factors.&lt;ref&gt;''Romero v. Superior Court'', [http://law.justia.com/cases/california/caapp4th/89/1068.html 89 Cal.App.4th 1068] (2001), quoting, "Juarez v. Boy Scouts of America, Inc." [http://law.justia.com/cases/california/caapp4th/81/377.html 81 Cal. App. 4th 377] (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, the duty inquiry focuses on the general category of conduct at issue and the range of foreseeable harm it creates, rather than the specific actions or injuries in each case.&lt;ref&gt;''Ballard v. Aribe'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/41C3d564.htm#MA000696 41 Cal. 3d 564, 572 n.6] (1986).
In this oft-cited footnote, the Court stated: "[A] court's task — in determining 'duty' — is not to decide whether a particular plaintiff's injury was reasonably foreseeable in light of a particular defendant's conduct, but rather to evaluate more generally whether the category of negligent conduct at issue is sufficiently likely to result in the kind of harm experienced that liability may appropriately be imposed on the negligent party."&lt;/ref&gt; Appellate lawyer [[Jeffrey Ehrlich]] persuaded the California Supreme Court to clarify the central importance of this distinction with its 2011 decision in ''Cabral v. Ralphs Grocery Co''. which requires "no duty" rulings to be based on categorical public-policy rules that can be applied to a range of cases, without reference to detailed facts.&lt;ref&gt;"Chavez v. Glock, Inc." [http://www.leagle.com/xmlresult.aspx?xmldoc=In%20CACO%2020120724024.xml 207 Cal.App.4th 1283, 1314] (2012), ''citing'', "Cabral v. Ralphs" [http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/cabral-v-ralphs-grocery-33956 51 Cal.4th 764, 772] (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;    By requiring courts to apply the ''Rowland'' factors at this high level of factual generality, the ''Cabral'' decision preserved the role of juries in determining whether the defendant breached its duty of care based on the unique circumstances of each case.&lt;ref name="51 Cal.4th 764"/&gt;

A majority of U.S. states have adopted some kind of multi-factor analysis based on the work of Prosser and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Adams v. City of Fremont'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/68CA4t243.htm 68 Cal.App.4th 243] (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;  Some states simply copied California's factors but modified them, like [[Michigan]] (which deleted the insurance factor and never picked up the social utility factor),&lt;ref&gt;''Buczkowski v. McKay'', 441 Mich. 96, 1100-1101; 490 N.W.2d 330 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; while others developed different lists of factors, such as this one from [[Tennessee]]:

*the foreseeability of the harm or injury;
*the possible magnitude of the potential harm or injury;
*the importance or social value of the activity engaged in by the defendant;
*the usefulness of the conduct to the defendant;
*the feasibility of alternative conduct;
*the costs and burdens associated with the alternative conduct;
*the relative usefulness of the alternative conduct;
*and the relative safety of the alternative conduct.&lt;ref&gt;''McCall v. Wilder'', 913 S.W.2d 150, 153 (Tenn. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 law review article identified 43 states that use a multifactor analysis in 23 various incarnations; consolidating them together results in a list of 42 different factors used by U.S. courts to determine whether a duty of care exists.&lt;ref&gt;W. Jonathan Cardi, ''The Hidden Legacy of Palsgraf: Modern Duty Law in Microcosm'', 91 B.U.L. Rev. 1873 (Dec. 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tennessee Court of Appeal has also recently followed the California Supreme Court's lead by citing ''Cabral'' for the proposition that duty determinations must be made at the highest level of factual generality.&lt;ref&gt;"Gregory v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville", [http://judicialview.com/State-Cases/tennessee/Government__Politics/Gregory-v-Metropolitan-Government-of-Nashville-and-Davidson-County/28/565916 2012 WL 5306196, *10] (Tenn. Ct. App., 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
{{main article|Standard of care|Reasonable person}}

Once a duty exists, the plaintiff must show that the defendant ''breached'' it. This is generally treated as the second element of negligence in the United States. Breach involves testing the defendant's actions against the standard of a ''reasonable person'', which varies depending on the facts of the case. For example, [[physician]]s will be held to reasonable standards for members of their profession, rather than those of the general public, in negligence actions for [[medical malpractice]].

In turn, once the appropriate standard has been found, the ''breach'' is proven when the plaintiff shows that the defendant's conduct fell below or did not reach the relevant standard of reasonable care.&lt;ref&gt;''Quelimane Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co.'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/19C4t26.htm 19 Cal.4th 26] (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is possible that the defendant took every possible precaution and ''exceeded'' what would have been done by any reasonable person, yet the plaintiff was injured. If that is the case, then as a matter of law, the duty of care has not been breached and the plaintiff cannot recover in negligence.&lt;ref&gt;''Gilson v. Metropolitan Opera'', 5 N.Y.3d 574 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bozzi v. Nordstrom, Inc.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/186CA4t755.htm 186 Cal. App. 4th 755] (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; This is the key difference between negligence and [[strict liability]]; if strict liability attaches to the defendant's conduct, then the plaintiff can recover under that theory regardless of whatever precautions were taken by the defendant.

==Examples==

=== Products ===
Product liability was the context in which the general duty of care first developed. Manufacturers owe a duty of care to consumers who ultimately purchase and use the products. In the case of ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 562 of the House of Lords, [[James Atkin, Baron Atkin|Lord Atkin]] stated:

{{bquote|My Lords, if your Lordships accept the view that this pleading discloses a relevant cause of action you will be affirming the proposition that by Scots and English law alike a manufacturer of products, which he sells in such a form as to show that he intends them to reach the ultimate consumer in the form in which they left him with no reasonable possibility of intermediate examination, and with the knowledge that the absence of reasonable care in the preparation or putting up of the products will result in an injury to the consumer's life or property, owes a duty to the consumer to take that reasonable care.}}

[[File:Occupiers Liability Warning Notice Ireland.JPG|thumb|right|upright|A notice informing potential entrants of limits to the duty of care]]
At common law, in the case of landowners, the extent of their duty of care to those who came on their premises varied depending on whether a person was classified as a [[trespasser]], [[licensee]], or [[invitee]]. This rule was eventually abolished in some common law jurisdictions.  For example, England enacted the [[Occupiers Liability Act 1957]]. Similarly, in the 1968 landmark case of ''[[Rowland v. Christian]]'',&lt;ref name="69 Cal. 2d 108"/&gt; the [[Supreme Court of California]] replaced the old classifications with a general duty of care to ''all'' persons on one's land, regardless of their status. After several highly publicized and controversial cases, the [[California Legislature]] enacted a statute in 1985 that partially restored immunity to landowners from some types of lawsuits from trespassers.&lt;ref&gt;''Calvillo-Silva v. Home Grocery'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/C4/19C4t714.htm 19 Cal. 4th 714] (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

Colorado's highest court adopted the ''Rowland'' unified duty of care analysis in 1971. The resulting explosion of lawsuits against Colorado landowners caused the state legislature to enact the Colorado Premises Liability Act in 1986, which enacted a cleaned-up statutory version of the common law classifications ''and'' simultaneously expressly displaced all common law remedies against landowners in order to prevent state courts from again expanding their liability.

In the [[Republic of Ireland]], under the Occupiers' Liability Act, 1995, the duty of care to trespassers, visitors and "recreational users" can be restricted by the occupier; provided reasonable notice is given, for which a prominent notice at the usual entrance to the premises usually suffices.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In business, "the duty of care addresses the attentiveness and prudence of managers in performing their decision-making and supervisory functions."&lt;ref name="E&amp;E1"&gt;Alan R. Palmiter, ''Corporations: Examples and Explanations'', 5th ed. (New York: Aspen Publishers, 2006), 192.&lt;/ref&gt; The "business judgment rule presumes that directors (and officers) carry out their functions in [[good faith]], after sufficient investigation, and for acceptable reasons. Unless this presumption is overcome, courts abstain from second-guessing well-meaning business decisions even when they are flops. This is a risk that shareholders take when they make a corporate investment."&lt;ref name="E&amp;E1"/&gt;

The Duty of Care Risk Analysis Standard (DoCRA) provides principles and practices for evaluating risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docra.org/|title=The Duty of Care Risk Analysis Standard|last=|first=|date=|website=DoCRA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considers all parties that could be affected by those risks. DoCRA evaluates safeguards if they are appropriate in protecting others from harm while presenting a reasonable burden.

'''Eschatological verification''' describes a process whereby a proposition can be verified after death. A proposition such as "there is an afterlife" is verifiable if true but not falsifiable if false (if it's false, the individual will not know it's false, because they have no state of being). The term is most commonly used in relation to [[God]] and the [[afterlife]], although there may be other propositions - such as moral propositions - which may also be verified after death. 

[[John Hick]] has expressed the premise as an allegory of a quest to a Celestial City. In this parable, a [[theist]] and an [[atheist]] are both walking down the same road. The theist believes there is a destination, the atheist believes there is not. If they reach the destination, the theist will have been proven right; however, if there is no destination on an endless road, this can never be verified. This is an attempt to explain how a theist expects some form of life or existence after death and an atheist does not. They both have separate belief systems and live life accordingly, but logically one is right and the other is not. If the theist is right, he will be proven so when he arrives in the afterlife. However, if the atheist is right, they will simply both be dead and nothing will be verified.

This acts as a response to [[Verificationism]]. Under Hick's analogy claims about the [[afterlife]] are verifiable ''in principle'' because the truth becomes clear after death. To some extent it is therefore wrong to claim that religious language cannot be verified because it can (when you're dead).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7749">In [[general relativity]] the light is assumed to propagate in the [[vacuum]] along [[null geodesic]] in a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]. Besides the geodesics principle in a [[classical field theory]] there exists the [[Fermat's principle]] for [[stationary spacetime|stationary gravity fields]].&lt;ref name = "Land"&gt;{{Citation|author=Landau, Lev D.|authorlink=Lev Landau|author2= Lifshitz, Evgeny F.| author2-link=Evgeny Lifshitz|title=The Classical Theory of Fields (4th ed.)|location=London|publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]]|date=1980|isbn=9780750627689| page = 273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fermat's principle ==

In more general case for [[Conformal manifold|conformally]] [[stationary spacetime]] &lt;ref name = "Perl"&gt;{{Citation|author= Perlik, Volker |title=Gravitational Lensing from a Spacetime Perspective|journal= Living Rev. Relativ.| volume=7| date=2004| issue=9|at=Chapter 4.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with [[coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;(t,x^1,x^2,x^3) &lt;/math&gt; a Fermat [[Metric tensor|metric]] takes form

:&lt;math&gt;g=e^{2f(t,x)}[(dt+\phi_{\alpha}(x)dx^{\alpha})^{2}-\hat{g}_{\alpha\beta} dx^{\alpha} dx^{\beta}]&lt;/math&gt;,

where conformal factor &lt;math&gt;f(t,x)&lt;/math&gt; depending on time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and [[space]] coordinates &lt;math&gt;x^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; does not affect the [[lightlike]] geodesics apart from their parametrization.

Fermat's principle for a pseudo-Riemannian manifold states that the light ray path between points &lt;math&gt;x_a=(x^1_a,x^2_a,x^3_a) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_b=(x^1_b,x^2_b,x^3_b) &lt;/math&gt; corresponds to zero variation of [[Action (physics)|action]]

:&lt;math&gt;S=\int^{\mu_a}_{\mu_b}\left(\sqrt{\hat{g}_{\alpha\beta} \frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d\mu} \frac{dx^{\beta}}{d\mu}}+\phi_{\alpha}(x)\frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d\mu} \right) d\mu&lt;/math&gt;,

where  &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is any parameter ranging over an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] &lt;math&gt;[\mu_a, \mu_b] &lt;/math&gt;  and varying along [[curve]] with fixed endpoints &lt;math&gt;x_a=x(\mu_a) &lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;x_b=x(\mu_b)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Principle of stationary integral of energy ==

In principle of stationary integral of energy for a light-like particle's motion, the pseudo-Riemannian metric with coefficients &lt;math&gt;\tilde{g}_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by a transformation

:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{g}_{00} =\rho ^{2}{g}_{00} ,\,\,\,\, \tilde{g}_{0k}=\rho{g}_{0k} ,\,\,\,\, \tilde{g}_{kq} ={g}_{kq} .&lt;/math&gt;

With time coordinate &lt;math&gt;x^0&lt;/math&gt; and space coordinates with indexes ''k,q=1,2,3'' the [[line element]] is written in form

:&lt;math&gt; ds^2=\rho^2 g_{00}(dx^{0})^{2}+ 2\rho g_{0k}dx^{0}dx^{k}+g_{kq}dx^{k}dx^{q},&lt;/math&gt;
       
where &lt;math&gt;\rho &lt;/math&gt;  is some quantity, which is assumed equal 1 and regarded as the energy of the light-like particle with &lt;math&gt;ds=0&lt;/math&gt;. Solving this equation for &lt;math&gt;\rho &lt;/math&gt; under condition &lt;math&gt;g_{00} \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;  gives two solutions

:&lt;math&gt;\rho =\frac{-g_{0k} v^{k} \pm \sqrt{(g_{0k} g_{0q} -g_{00} g_{kq})v^{k} v^{q} } }{g_{00} v^{0} },&lt;/math&gt;
           
where &lt;math&gt;v^{i}=dx^i/d\mu&lt;/math&gt; are elements of the [[four-velocity]]. Even if one solution, in accordance with making definitions, is &lt;math&gt;\rho=1 &lt;/math&gt;.

With &lt;math&gt;g_{00}=0&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;g_{0k} \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; even if for one ''k'' the energy takes form

:&lt;math&gt;\rho =-\frac{g_{kq} v^{k} v^{q} }{2v_{0} v^{0}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In both cases for the [[Free motion equation|free moving]] particle the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] is

:&lt;math&gt;L= -\rho.&lt;/math&gt;
                                                                       
Its [[partial derivatives]] give the [[Momentum|canonical momenta]]

:&lt;math&gt;p_{\lambda}=\frac{\partial L}{\partial v^{\lambda}}=\frac{v_{\lambda}}{v^{0}v_{0}}&lt;/math&gt;
                                                      
and the [[forces]]

: &lt;math&gt;F_{\lambda}=\frac{\partial L }{\partial x^{\lambda}}=\frac{1}{2v^{0}v_{0}}\frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial x^{\lambda}}v^{i}v^{j}.&lt;/math&gt;

Momenta satisfy energy condition &lt;ref name = "Land2"&gt;{{Citation|author=Landau, Lev D.|authorlink=Lev Landau|author2= Lifshitz, Evgeny F.| author2-link=Evgeny Lifshitz|title= Mechanics Vol. 1 (3rd ed.)|location=London|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|date=1976|isbn=9780750628969| page = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
for [[closed system]]  
             
:&lt;math&gt;\rho=v^{\lambda}p_{\lambda}-L,&lt;/math&gt;

and thus &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]].

Standard [[variational method|variational procedure]] according to [[Hamilton's principle]] is applied to action

:&lt;math&gt; S=\int^{\mu_a}_{\mu_b}L d\mu=-\int^{\mu_a}_{\mu_b}\rho d\mu, &lt;/math&gt;
 
which is integral of energy. Stationary action is conditional upon zero variational derivatives {{math|''δS''/''δx''&lt;sup&gt;λ&lt;/sup&gt; }}
and leads to [[Euler–Lagrange equations]]

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\mu}\frac{\partial \rho }{\partial v^{\lambda}}-\frac{\partial \rho }{\partial x^{\lambda}}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

which is rewritten in form

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\mu} p_{\lambda}-F_{\lambda}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

After substitution of canonical momentum and forces they give motion equations of lightlike particle in a [[free space]]

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv^{0}}{d\mu}+\frac{v^{0}}{2v_{0}}\frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial x^{0}}v^{i}v^{j}=0&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; (g_{k\lambda} v_{0}-g_{0k}v_{\lambda})\frac{dv^{k}}{d\mu}+\left[\frac{1}{2v_{0}}\frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial x^{0}}(g_{00}v^{0}v_{\lambda}+ g_{k\lambda}v^{k}v_{0})-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial g_{ij}}{\partial x^{\lambda}}v_{0} +\frac{\partial g_{i\lambda}}{\partial x^{j}}v_0- \frac{\partial g_{0i}}{\partial x^{j}}v_{\lambda}\right]v^i v^j=0.&lt;/math&gt;

== Static spacetime ==
For the [[Isotropic_line|isotropic paths]] a transformation to metric &lt;math&gt; \overline{g}_{ij}=g_{ij}/{g_{00}}&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to replacement of parameter &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;  on &lt;math&gt;d\overline{\mu}=d\mu/\sqrt{g_{00}}&lt;/math&gt; to which the four-velocities &lt;math&gt;\overline{v}^{i}=dx^i/d\overline{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; correspond. The curve of motion of lightlike particle in [[four-dimensional space]]time and value of energy &lt;math&gt;\rho &lt;/math&gt;  are [[invariant (physics)|invariant]] under this reparametrization. 
For the [[static spacetime]] the first equation of motion with appropriate parameter &lt;math&gt;\overline \mu&lt;/math&gt;  gives &lt;math&gt;\overline v^0=1&lt;/math&gt; . Canonical momentum and forces take form

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{p}_{\lambda}=\overline v_{\lambda}; \qquad \overline{F}_{\lambda}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial \overline{g}_{ij}}{\partial x^{\lambda}}\overline{v}^{i}\overline{v}^{j}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution of them in Euler–Lagrange equations gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d\mu}\left(\overline{g}_{\lambda k} \overline{v}^k\right)=\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial \overline{g}_{ij}}{\partial x^{\lambda}}\overline{v}^{i}\overline{v}^{j}&lt;/math&gt;.

After differentiation on the left side and multiplying by &lt;math&gt;\overline{g}^{l \lambda}&lt;/math&gt; this expression, after the summation over the repeated index &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, becomes null geodesic equations

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 x^l}{d\overline{\mu}^2}+\Gamma^l_{ij} \frac{dx^i}{d\overline{\mu}}\frac{dx^j}{d\overline{\mu}}=0,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^l_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are the second kind [[Christoffel symbols]] with respect to the [[metric tensor]] &lt;math&gt; \overline{g}_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;.

So in case of the static spacetime the geodesic principle and the energy variational method as well as Fermat's principle give the same solution for the light propagation.

[[File:Ana Dili.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|The monument for the ''mother tongue'' ("Ana dili") in [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]], [[Azerbaijan]]]]
A '''first language''', '''native language''', or '''mother/father/parent tongue''' (also known as '''arterial language''' or '''L1''') is a [[language]] that a person has been exposed to from birth&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, Leonard. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Gfrd-On5iFwC&amp;dq Language] {{ISBN|81-208-1196-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or within the [[critical period hypothesis|critical period]]. In some countries, the term ''native language'' or ''mother tongue'' refers to the language of one's ethnic group rather than one's first language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JeTwQB5doD4C&amp;dq/  "K*The Native Speaker: Myth and Reality By Alan Davies] {{ISBN|1-85359-622-1}} {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children brought up speaking more than one language can have more than one native language, and be [[Simultaneous bilingualism|bilingual]] or [[multilingual]]. By contrast, a ''[[second language]]'' is any language that one speaks other than one's first language.

==Terminology==
[[File:Kituwah Academy.png|thumb|right|A lesson at Kituwah Academy on the [[Qualla Boundary]] in [[North Carolina]]. The [[language immersion]] school, operated by the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]], teaches the same curriculum as other [[United States|American]] [[primary schools]], but [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] is the medium of instruction from [[preschool]] onward, and students learn it as a first language. Such schools have proven instrumental in the preservation and perpetuation of Cherokee.]]
One of the more widely accepted definitions of native speakers is that they were born in a particular country raised to speak the language of that country during the critical period of their development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipedr.com/vol26/16-ICLLL%202011-L00033.pdf|title=Who Is An Ideal Native Speaker?! Andisheh Saniei, English Language Department, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran|website=ipedr.com|accessdate=1 February 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202012310/http://www.ipedr.com/vol26/16-ICLLL%202011-L00033.pdf|archivedate=2 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person qualifies as a "native speaker" of a language by being born and immersed in the language during youth, in a family in which the adults shared a similar language experience as the child.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Love, Nigel, and Umberto Ansaldo. "The Native Speaker and the Mother Tongue." Language Sciences 32.6 (2010): 589-93. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Native speakers are considered to be an authority on their given language because of their natural acquisition process regarding the language, as opposed to having learned the language later in life. That is achieved by personal interaction with the language and speakers of the language. Native speakers will not necessarily be knowledgeable about every grammatical rule of the language, but they will have good "intuition" of the rules through their experience with the language.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Sometimes, the term "'''mother tongue'''" or "'''mother language'''" is used for the language that a person learned as a child at home (usually from their parents). Children growing up in bilingual homes can, according to this definition, have more than one mother tongue or native language.

In the context of population censuses conducted on the Canadian population, [[Statistics Canada]] defines ''mother tongue'' as "the first language learned at home in childhood and still understood by the individual at the time of the census."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Reference/dict/pop082.htm |title=mother tongue |work=2001 census |accessdate=25 August 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916172728/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/Products/Reference/dict/pop082.htm |archivedate=16 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }} {{Unreliable source?|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is quite possible that the first language learned is no longer a speaker's dominant language. That includes young immigrant children whose families have moved to a new linguistic environment as well as people who learned their mother tongue as a young child at home (rather than the language of the majority of the community), who may have lost, in part or in totality, the language they first [[language acquisition|acquired]] (see [[language attrition]]).

===Mother tongue===

According to [[Ivan Illich]], the term "mother tongue" was first used by [[Catholic]] monks to designate a particular language they used, instead of [[Latin]], when they are "speaking from the pulpit". That is, the "holy mother the Church" introduced this term and colonies inherited it from Christianity as a part of colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;[Ivan Illich] in Patttanayak, 1981:24 cited in [https://www.academia.edu/411071/_M_Other_Tongue_Syndrome_From_Breast_To_Bottle._ "(M)other Tongue Syndrome: From Breast to Bottle"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830045733/http://www.academia.edu/411071/_M_Other_Tongue_Syndrome_From_Breast_To_Bottle._ |date=30 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Illich, [http://www.preservenet.com/theory/Illich/Vernacular.html "Vernacular Values"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720033517/http://www.preservenet.com/theory/Illich/Vernacular.html |date=20 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, such as [[Kenya]], [[India]], and various East Asian countries, "mother language" or "native language" is used to indicate the language of one's [[ethnic group]] in both common and journalistic parlance ("I have no apologies for not learning my mother tongue"), rather than one's first language. Also, in [[Singapore]], "mother tongue" refers to the language of one's [[ethnic group]] regardless of actual proficiency, and the "first language" refers to English, which was established on the island under the [[British Empire]], which is the [[lingua franca]] for most post-independence Singaporeans because of its use as the language of instruction in government schools and as a working language.

[[J. R. R. Tolkien]], in his 1955 lecture "[[English and Welsh]]," distinguishes the "native tongue" from the "cradle tongue." The latter is the language one happens to learn during early childhood, and one's true "native tongue" may be different, possibly determined by an [[genetic memory (biology)|inherited linguistic taste]] and may later in life be discovered by a strong emotional affinity to a specific dialect (Tolkien personally confessed to such an affinity to the [[Middle English]] of the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] in particular).

On 17 November 1999, UNESCO designated 21 February as [[International Mother Language Day]].

==Significance==
The first language of a child is part of the personal, social and cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bisnet.or.id/vle/mod/resource/view.php?id=1663|title=Terri Hirst: The Importance of Maintaining a Childs First Language|author=|date=|website=bisnet.or.id|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312012655/http://bisnet.or.id/vle/mod/resource/view.php?id=1663|archivedate=12 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another impact of the first language is that it brings about the reflection and learning of successful social patterns of acting and speaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~lera/papers/mandarin.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510152648/http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~lera/papers/mandarin.pdf |archivedate=10 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is basically responsible for differentiating the linguistic competence of acting. While some argue that there is no such thing as "native speaker" or a "mother tongue," it is important to understand the key terms as well as understand what it means to be a "non-native" speaker and the implications that can have on one's life. Research suggest that while a non-native speaker may develop fluency in a targeted language after about two years of immersion, it can actually take between five and seven years for that child to be on the same working level as their native speaking counterparts. That has implications on the education of non-native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Second Language Acquisition Essential Information: Professor J. Cumminshttp://esl.fis.edu/teachers/support/cummin.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The topic of native speaker also gives way to discussion about what exactly bilingualism is. One definition is that a person is bilingual by being equally proficient in both languages. A person who grows up speaking English and begins learning Spanish for four years is not necessarily bilingual unless they speak the two languages with equal fluency. Pearl and Lambert were the first to test only “balanced” bilinguals—that is, a child who is completely fluent in two languages and feel that neither is their “native” language because they grasp the two so perfectly. This study found the following: balanced bilinguals perform significantly better in tasks that require flexibility (they constantly shift between the two known languages depending on the situation/requires constant juggling), more aware of arbitrary nature of language and also that balanced bilinguals choose word associations based on logical rather than phonetic preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alsintl.com/blog/language-proficiency/ |title=Language Proficiency: Defining Levels Avoids Confusion |publisher=Alsintl.com |date=2013-08-26 |accessdate=2013-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917082347/http://www.alsintl.com/blog/language-proficiency |archivedate=17 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/khakuta/research/publications/(1985)%20-%20THE%20RELATIONSHIP%20BETWEEN%20DEGREE%20OF%20BILINGUALISM%20AND.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024165613/http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/khakuta/research/publications/(1985)%20-%20THE%20RELATIONSHIP%20BETWEEN%20DEGREE%20OF%20BILINGUALISM%20AND.pdf |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multilingualism==
One can have two or more native languages, thus being a native ''bilingual'' or indeed ''[[Multilingualism|multilingual]]''. The order in which these languages are learned is not necessarily the order of proficiency. For instance, if a French-speaking couple have a child who learned French first but then the child grew up in an English-speaking country, the child would likely be most proficient in English. Other examples are in [[India]], [[Languages of Indonesia|Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Kenya]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Languages of South Africa|South Africa]], where most people speak more than one language.

The designation "native language," in its general usage, is thought to be imprecise and subject to various interpretations that are biased linguistically, especially with respect to bilingual children from ethnic minority groups. Many scholars{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} have given definitions of 'native language' based on common usage, the emotional relation of the speaker towards the language, and even its dominance in relation to the environment. However, all of three criteria lack precision. For many children whose home language differs from the language of the environment (the 'official' language), it is debatable which language is one's 'native language'. 

===Defining "native language"{{anchor|Defining native language}}===
*Based on origin: the language(s) one learned first (the language(s) in which one has established the first long-lasting verbal contacts).
*Based on internal identification: the language(s) one identifies with/as a speaker of;
*Based on external identification: the language(s) one is identified with/as a speaker of, by others.
*Based on competence: the language(s) one knows best.
*Based on function: the language(s) one uses most.

===Defining "native speaker"===
The article titled “The Native Speaker: An Achievable Model?” published by the Asian EFL Journal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Joseph|title=The Native Speaker: An Achievable Model?|journal=Asian EFL Journal|volume=7|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that there are six general principles that relate to the definition of "native speaker". The principles, according to the study, are typically accepted by language experts across the scientific field. A native speaker is defined according to the guidelines as this:

#The individual acquired the language in early childhood.
#The individual has intuitive knowledge of the language.
#The individual is able to produce fluent, spontaneous discourse.
#The individual is competent in communication.
#The individual identifies with or is identified by a language community.
#The individual has a dialect accent (including the official dialect).

'''Forced prostitution''', also known as '''involuntary prostitution''', is [[prostitution]] or [[sexual slavery]] that takes place as a result of [[coercion]] by a third party. The terms "forced prostitution" or "enforced prostitution" appear in international and humanitarian conventions such as [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]]&lt;ref&gt;Article 7: [[Crime against humanity]]&lt;/ref&gt; but have been insufficiently understood and inconsistently applied. "Forced prostitution" refers to conditions of control over a person who is coerced by another to engage in sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/0/3d25270b5fa3ea998025665f0032f220?OpenDocument |title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on systematic rape |publisher=Unhchr.ch |date= |accessdate=7 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112211407/http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/0/3d25270b5fa3ea998025665f0032f220?OpenDocument |archivedate=12 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced prostitution is a crime against the person because of the violation of the victim's rights of movement through coercion and because of their commercial exploitation.

==Legal situation==
'''Forced prostitution''' is illegal under [[customary law]] in all countries.&lt;ref name="Bantekas 2003 6"&gt;{{cite book |title= International Criminal Law|edition=2d|last= Bantekas |first= Ilias |author2=Susan Nash |year= 2003|publisher=Routledge |location= Cavendish |isbn= 978-1859417768 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MyP4tSaMA_IC|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is different from voluntary prostitution which may have a different legal status in different countries, which range from being fully illegal and [[punishable by death]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/iran.htm|title=Iran - Facts on Trafficking and Prostitution|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008164248/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/iran.htm|archivedate=8 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to being legal and regulated as an occupation.

While the legality of adult prostitution varies between jurisdictions, the [[prostitution of children]] is illegal nearly everywhere in the world.

In 1949, the [[UN General Assembly]] adopted the [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]]. This Convention supersedes a number of earlier conventions that covered some aspects of forced prostitution, and also deals with other aspects of prostitution. It penalises the procurement and enticement to prostitution as well as the maintenance of [[brothels]].&lt;ref name="Bantekas 2003 6"/&gt; As at December 2013, the Convention has only been ratified by 82 countries.&lt;ref name=ratifications&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=VII-11-a&amp;chapter=7&amp;lang=en |title=UNTC |publisher= |accessdate=25 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907020434/https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=VII-11-a&amp;chapter=7&amp;lang=en |archivedate=7 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main reasons it has not been ratified by many countries is because it 'voluntary' is broadly defined in countries with a legal sex industry.&lt;ref name="Bantekas 2003 6"/&gt; For example, in countries such as [[Germany]],&lt;ref name="economist-prostitution2004" /&gt; [[the Netherlands]],&lt;ref name="economist-prostitution2004" /&gt; [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref name="Economist-prostitution-2008"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_TNVTGVRN|title=Policing prostitution: The oldest conundrum|publisher=The Economist|date=30 October 2008|accessdate=11 January 2010}} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2002/18368.htm|title=Greece|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Turkey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/world/middleeast/24iht-m24-turkey-brothel.html|title=Turkey Cracks Down on Legal Brothels|first=Susanne|last=Güsten|date=23 January 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries some forms of prostitution and pimping are legal and regulated as professional occupations.

==Child prostitution==
{{Main| Child prostitution}}
Child prostitution is considered inherently non-consensual and exploitative, as children, because of their age, are not legally able to consent. In most countries child prostitution is illegal irrespective of the child reaching a lower statutory [[age of consent]].

State parties to the [[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography]] are required to prohibit child prostitution. The Protocol defines a child as any human being under the age of 18, "unless an earlier [[age of majority]] is recognized by a country's law". The Protocol entered into force on 18 January 2002,&lt;ref name=Protocol2&gt;{{cite web|title=Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography|work=United Nations Treaty Collection|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-11-c&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of December 2013, 166 states are party to the Protocol and another 10 states have signed but not yet ratified it.&lt;ref name=Protocol2/&gt;

The [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999]] (Convention No 104) of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) provides that the ''use, procuring or offering of a child for prostitution'' is one of the ''worst forms of [[child labor]]''. This [[Treaty|convention]], adopted in 1999, provides that countries that had ratified it must eliminate the practice urgently. It enjoys the fastest pace of ratifications in the ILO's history since 1919.

In the United States, the [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000]] classifies any "commercial sex act [which] is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age" to be a "Severe Form of Trafficking in Persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/tip/laws/61124.htm|title=Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000|publisher=US State Department|accessdate=17 February 2010|date=28 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, especially poorer countries, child prostitution remains a very serious problem, and numerous tourists from the [[Western World]] travel to these countries to engage in [[child sex tourism]]. [[Child prostitution in Thailand|Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[India]], [[Brazil]] and [[Child prostitution in Mexico|Mexico]] have been identified as leading hotspots of child sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38872 |title=RIGHTS-MEXICO: 16,000 Victims of Child Sexual Exploitation |author=Emilio Godoy |publisher=IPS |date=13 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326111520/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38872 |archivedate=26 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human trafficking==
{{Main|Human trafficking}}
{{Slavery}}
Human trafficking, especially of girls and women, often leads to forced prostitution and sexual slavery. According to a report by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UNODC]], internationally, the most common destinations for victims of human trafficking are [[Thailand]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Israel]], [[Belgium]], [[the Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Turkey]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6497799.stm|title=UN highlights human trafficking|date=26 March 2007|accessdate=11 January 2010|publisher=the [[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major sources of trafficked persons are Thailand, [[China]], [[Nigeria]], [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]], and [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

Following the first international conference on the prevention of trafficking of women in Paris in 1885 a series of initiatives to restrict the trade of women into the sex trade were initiated. Both the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]] have addressed the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Global Sex|last= Altman|first=Dennis |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location= |isbn= 9780226016054 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XC0QDlW3YFAC&amp;dq=forced+prostitution |page=114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] report estimates that globally, 79% of identified victims of human trafficking were trafficked for sexual exploitation, 18% for forced labor, and 3% for other forms of exploitation. In 2011, preliminary [[European Commission]] in September 2011 similarly estimated that among human-trafficking victims, 75% were trafficked for sexual exploitation and the rest for forced labor or other forms of exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;''The EU Strategy towards the Eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings, 2012–2016'', [[European Commission]] [[Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the illegal nature of prostitution and the different methodologies used in separating forced prostitution from voluntary prostitution, the extent of this phenomenon is difficult to estimate accurately. According to a 2008 report by the [[U.S. Department of State]]: "Annually, according to U.S. Government-sponsored research completed in 2006, 600,000 to 800,000 people are trafficked across national borders, which does not include millions trafficked within their own countries. Approximately 80% of transnational victims are women and girls and up to 50% are minors, and the majority of transnational victims are trafficked into commercial sexual exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2005/46606.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report, I. Introduction|accessdate=30 January 2010|date= 3 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 [[European Commission]] report found that from 2010 to 2013, a total of 30,146 people were registered as victims of human trafficking in the 28 [[member states of the European Union]]; of these, 69% were victims of sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29660126 Trafficking harms 30,000 in EU - most in sex trade], BBC News (October 17, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, ''[[The Economist]]'' claimed that only a small proportion of prostitutes were explicitly trafficked against their will.&lt;ref name="economist-prostitution2004"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/3151258|title=Prostitution: Sex is their business|date=2 September 2004|accessdate=15 December 2009|publisher=The Economist}} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Pisani]] protested against the perceived hysteria around human trafficking preceding sport events like the Super Bowl or World Cup of Soccer.&lt;ref name="wisdomOfWhores-traffick"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pisani|first1=Elizabeth|authorlink=Elizabeth Pisani|title=The Wisdom of Whores: Bureaucrats, Brothels and the Business of AIDS|pages=213–214|url=http://www.wisdomofwhores.com/|publisher=Granta Books|isbn=978-1-84708-076-9|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]] (also referred to as the Palermo Protocol) is a [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] to the United Nations [[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]] and defines human trafficking as the "recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNTOC/Publications/TOC%20Convention/TOCebook-e.pdf "United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime"], Annex II, Section I, Article 3 (pg. 42). Retrieved on 21 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, threat, coercion, or use of force is not necessary to constitute trafficking, the exploitation of an existing vulnerability{{snd}}such as economic vulnerability or sexual vulnerability{{snd}}is sufficient. [[Sigma Huda]], UN special reporter on trafficking in persons, observed that "For the most part, prostitution as actually practiced in the world usually does satisfy the elements of trafficking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prostitution and Human Trafficking: Tackling Demand &lt;!--The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill:A Briefing from CARE--&gt; |url=http://chaste.org.uk/public_documents/CJI_Briefing_Doc_CARE_CHASTE_001.pdf |accessdate=19 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305202011/http://www.chaste.org.uk/public_documents/CJI_Briefing_Doc_CARE_CHASTE_001.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissuesmagazine.com/july08/july2008_5.php|title="It's Not TV, Its Sexploitation" Protest Against Home Box Office|author=Norma Ramos|publisher=On the Issues Magazine|date=Summer 2008|accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Save the Children]] see explicit trafficking and prostitution as different issues: "The issue [human trafficking] however, gets mired in controversy and confusion when prostitution too is considered as a violation of the basic human rights of both adult women and minors, and equal to sexual exploitation per se. From this standpoint then, trafficking and prostitution become conflated with each other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808002851/http://www.savethechildren.net/nepal/key_issues/traffdefinition.html |archivedate=8 August 2007 |title=Definition of Trafficking |publisher=Save the Children |accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voluntary vs involuntary prostitution==
With regard to prostitution, three worldviews exist: ''abolitionism'' (where the prostitute is considered a victim), ''regulation'' (where the prostitute is considered a worker) and ''prohibitionism'' (where the prostitute is considered a criminal). Currently all these views are represented in some Western country.

For the proponents of the abolitionist view, prostitution is always a coercive practice, and the prostitute is seen as a victim. They argue that most prostitutes are forced into the practice, either directly, by [[pimps]] and [[human trafficking|traffickers]], indirectly through [[poverty]], [[drug addiction]] and other personal problems, or, as it has been argued in recent decades by [[radical feminists]] such as [[Andrea Dworkin]], [[Melissa Farley]] and [[Catharine MacKinnon]], merely by [[patriarchal]] social structures and power relations between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/MichLawJourI.html|title=Prostitution and Male Supremacy|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;
William D. Angel finds that "most" prostitutes have been forced into the occupation through poverty, lack of education and employment possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The International Law of Youth Rights |last= Angel |first= William D. |year= 1995 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |location= |isbn= 9780792333210 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=3kT3fTMoggIC&amp;vq=forced+prostitution&amp;dq=involuntary+prostitution |page=897}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kathleen Barry]] argues that there should be no distinction between "free" and "coerced", "voluntary" and "involuntary" prostitution, "since any form of prostitution is a human rights violation, an affront to womanhood that cannot be considered dignified labour".&lt;ref name="Lim 1998 14"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Sex Sector: The Economic and Social Bases of Prostitution in Southeast Asia |last= Lim |first= Lean |year= 1998 |publisher=International Labour Office |location= |isbn= 9789221095224 |page=14 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=VFNKZbL1jWwC&amp;vq=barry&amp;dq=%22involuntary+prostitution%22+definition}}&lt;/ref&gt;
France's [[The Greens (France)|Green Party]] argues: "The concept of "free choice" of the prostitute is indeed relative, in a society where gender inequality is institutionalized".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesverts.fr/spip.php?article120|title=Prostitution : les Verts opposés à la réouverture des maisons closes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The proponents of the abolitionist view hold that prostitution is a practice which ultimately leads to the mental, emotional and physical destruction of the women who engage in it, and, as such, it should be abolished.

In contrast to the abolitionist view, those who are in favour of legalization do not consider the women who practice prostitution as victims, but as independent adult women who had made a choice which should be respected. Mariska Majoor, former prostitute and founder of the [[Prostitution Information Center]], from [[Amsterdam]],  holds that: "In our [sex workers'] eyes it's a profession, a way of making money; it's important that we are realistic about this ... Prostitution is not bad; it's only bad if done against one's will. Most women make this decision themselves."&lt;ref name="allow"&gt;Allow ''Women to Sell Their Bodies to Earn a Living'', Monitor (Uganda), Apr. 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to proponents of regulation, prostitution should be considered a legitimate activity,  which must be recognized and regulated, in order to protect the workers' rights and to prevent abuse. The prostitutes are treated as [[sex workers]] who enjoy benefits similar to other [[Job (role)|occupations]]. The [[World Charter for Prostitutes Rights]] (1985), drafted by the [[International Committee for Prostitutes' Rights]], calls for the decriminalisation of "all aspects of adult prostitution resulting from individual decision".&lt;ref name="Lim 1998 14"/&gt; Since the mid-1970s, sex workers across the world have organised, demanding the [[decriminalisation]] of [[prostitution]], equal protection under the law, improved working conditions, the right to pay [[taxes]], travel and receive [[social benefits]] such as [[pension]]s.&lt;ref name="hiholv1i6"&gt;{{cite news|author=Amalia Cabezos|title=Hookers in the House of the Lord|publisher=Santa Monica Mirror|date=28 July – 4 August 1999|url=http://www.smmirror.com/Volume1/issue6/hooker.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080820101422/http://www.smmirror.com/Volume1/issue6/hooker.html|archivedate=20 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of such views on prostitution, countries such as [[Germany]],&lt;ref name="economist-prostitution2004" /&gt; the [[Netherlands]]&lt;ref name="Economist-prostitution-2008" /&gt; and [[New Zealand]]&lt;ref name="Economist-prostitution-2008" /&gt; have fully legalized prostitution.

==Legal discrimination==
Sexual [[discrimination]] happens to those who work both in [[sex work]] and forced prostitution. Historically, crimes involving [[violence against women]] and having to do with prostitution and sex work have been taken less seriously by the law. Although acts such as the [[Violence Against Women Act]] have been passed to take steps toward preventing such violence, there is still sexism rooted in the way that the legal system approaches these cases. Gender based violence is a serious form of discrimination that has slipped through many cracks in the legal system of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Neuwirth, Jessica. ''Equal Means Equal''. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts have fallen short due to the fact that there is no constitutional protection for women against discrimination.

There is often no evidence, according to police, that when men are arrested for soliciting a prostitute that it is a gender based crime. However, there are large discrepancies between the arrests of prostitutes and the arrests of men caught in the act. While 70% of prostitution related arrests are of woman prostitutes, only 10% of related arrests are men/customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bayswan.org/stats.html "PENet: Prostitution Issues: Statistics"]. ''www.bayswan.org''. Retrieved 7 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless if the girl or woman is either underage or forced into the exchange, she is still often arrested and victim blamed instead of being offered resources. The men who are charged with engaging in these illegal acts with woman who are prostitutes are able to pay for the exchange and therefore are usually able to pay for their release while the woman may not be able to. This generates a cycle of violence against women, as the situation’s outcome favors the man. In one case, a nineteen-year-old woman in Oklahoma was charged with offering to engage in prostitution when the woman was known to have previously been a victim of human sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="OSCN Case Details"&gt;[http://www.oscn.net/dockets/GetCaseInformation.aspx?db=oklahoma&amp;number=CF-2015-2310&amp;cmid=3247403 "OSCN Case Details"]. ''www.oscn.net''. Retrieved 5 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She is an example of how the criminalization of prostitution often leads to women being arrested multiple times due to the fact that they are often punished or arrested even when the victim of a situation.&lt;ref name="OSCN Case Details"/&gt; Young women and girls have a much higher likelihood of getting arrested for prostitution than boys in general, and woman victims of human trafficking often end up being arrested upon multiple occasions, being registered as a sex offender, and being institutionalized.The lack of rehabilitation given to women after experiences with human [[sex trafficking]] contributes to the cycles of arrests that most woman who engage in prostitution face.

The ERA or [[Equal Rights Amendment]] is a proposed amendment to the [[United States Constitution|U.S Constitution]] that has not yet been ratified. It would guarantee that equal rights could not be denied under the law on account of sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/ "ERA: Home"]. ''www.equalrightsamendment.org''. Retrieved 7 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; With this amendment in place, it would allow for sex workers and victims of human sex trafficking to have legal leverage when it comes to the discrepancies in how men and women (customers and prostitutes) are prosecuted. This is due to the fact that there would be legal grounds to argue the unequal legal treatment on account of sex, which is not currently outlawed by the U.S constitution. Although there are other acts and laws that protect against discrimination based on a variety of categories and identities, they are often not substantial enough, provide loopholes, and do not offer adequate protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/faq.htm#q10 "ERA: FAQ"]. ''www.equalrightsamendment.org''. Retrieved 7 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This connects to [[liberal feminism]] and the more individualistic approach that comes with this theory. Liberal feminists believe that there should be equality between the sexes and this should be gained through equal legal rights, equal education, and women having "greater self value as individuals".&lt;ref&gt;Wendell, Susan (1987). ''A (Qualified) Defense of Liberal Feminism''. Hypatia. pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory focuses on equality at a more individual level as supposed to rethinking legal systems themselves or systems of gender, just as the ERA works for the equality of sexes within an existing system.

In Mexico, many criminal organisations lure, and capture women and use them in brothels. Once the women become useless to the organisations, they are often killed. Often, the criminal organisations focus on poor, unemployed girls, and lure them via job offerings (regular jobs), done via billboards and posters, placed on the streets. In some cities, like [[Ciudad Juárez]], there is a high degree of corruption in all levels on the social ladder (police, courts, ...) which makes it more difficult to combat this criminal activity. Hotels where women are kept and which are known by the police are often also not raided/closed down by police. Nor are the job offerings actively investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Delarosa Hickerson on corruption in Ciudad Juárez&lt;/ref&gt; Some NGO's such as [[Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa A.C.]] are trying to fight back, often without much success.

Young women from countries under Japanese Imperial control were reportedly abducted from their homes. In some cases, women were also recruited with offers to work in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimi|2000|pp=100–101, 105–106, 110–111}};&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Fackler 2007-03-06|Ref=CITEREFNY Times2007-03-06}};&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|BBC 2007-03-02}};&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|BBC 2007-03-08}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been documented that the Japanese military itself recruited women by force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van Buitenlandse zaken|1994|pp=6–9, 11, 13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Japanese historian [[Ikuhiko Hata]] stated that there was no organized forced recruitment of comfort women by the Japanese government or military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The number and nature of comfort women servicing the Japanese military during World War II is still being actively debated, and the matter is still highly political in both Japan and the rest of the [[Far East|Far East Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;According to journalist Satoshi Ikeuchi: "Even though the forcible recruitment of women was not systematically implemented, the (Japanese) government should acknowledge its moral responsibility if any single woman victimized by the private operators through fraud, exploitation, violence or other acts of intimidation comes forward to tell her story. The government should do so because the military gave consent to set up brothels for soldiers and had responsibility for overseeing them.»  «In this context, the issue of the so-called comfort women was invested with extreme importance as the epitome of Japanese sin from the viewpoint of some and became the focal point of contention, The excessive effort by leftists and liberals in politicizing this issue as one of the few means left to shake conservative dominance, by extending the notion of coercion to the extreme, resulted in alienating a large part of the nation. Their open intention to collude with rising tides of hostile nationalism in Korea and China also hardened the minds of many in Japan." 25 April 2007. Satoshi Ikeuchi, [http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/columns/commentary/20070425dy01.htm Overcoming postwar mind-set], Daily Yomuri Online, 25 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many military brothels were run by private agents and supervised by the Korean Police. Some Japanese historians, using the testimony of ex-comfort women, have argued that the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]] were either directly or indirectly involved in coercing, deceiving, luring, and sometimes kidnapping young women throughout Japan's [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|Asian colonies and occupied territories]].&lt;ref name="denial"&gt;{{Harvnb|Onishi 2007-03-08|Ref=CITEREFNY Times2007-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===

In Southern [[India]] &amp; eastern Indian state of [[Odisha]], [[devadasi]] is the practice of hierodulic prostitution, with similar customary forms such as basavi,&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Slavery Society. [http://anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/hieroras.htm Child Hierodulic Servitude in India and Nepal]&lt;/ref&gt; and involves dedicating pre-pubescent and young adolescent girls from villages in a ritual marriage to a deity or a temple, who then work in the temple and function as spiritual guides, dancers, and prostitutes servicing male devotees in the temple. [[Human Rights Watch]] reports claim that devadasis are forced into this service and, at least in some cases, to practice prostitution for upper-caste members.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch. [http://hrw.org/campaigns/caste/presskit.htm Caste: Asia's Hidden Apartheid]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various state governments in [[India]] enacted laws to ban this practice both prior to India's independence and more recently. They include Bombay Devdasi Act, 1934, Devdasi (Prevention of dedication) Madras Act, 1947, Karnataka Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1982, and Andhra Pradesh Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.

The '''gender taxonomy''' is a [[Taxonomic classification|classification]] of the range of different levels at which [[human]]s vary in [[sexual characteristics]]. It is mainly used by medical specialists working in the area of [[sexology|sex research]].&lt;ref&gt;
"A review of cross-gender taxonomies shows that previous observers have identified and labeled a homosexual type far more consistently than any other category of male gender dysphoric."&lt;br /&gt;
[[Ray Blanchard]], "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/kp318216v0055487/ The classification and labeling of nonhomosexual gender dysphorias]", ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]'' '''18/4''' (1989): 315–334.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[John Money]] and [[Milton Diamond]] are probably the best known researchers in this field. Money earned his [[Doctorate|PhD]] for research into human [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditism]] and [[pseudohermaphroditism]], now known as [[intersex]] conditions. The [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] starts at the simplest, [[biology|biological]] level and traces differentiations expressed at the increasingly complicated levels produced over the course of the human [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]].

== Types of gender taxonomy ==

=== Gendered sexuality taxonomy ===
Contemporary definitions and conceptualizations of sex, gender, and sexuality lack sufficient subtlety to adequately describe the full range of human sexuality (Devor, 1994). 

A taxonomy of gendered sexuality, presented below, can better define the terms relevant to human sexuality and takes into account the interaction over time among sex, gender, and sexual fantasies, desires, practices of persons in intimate relationships at both the level of self-identity and attribution by others. 

The taxonomy is a combination of classifications based on the genetic sexes of persons in relationships and categorizations based on those persons' social genders to arrive at classifications of gendered sexuality. 

Terminology for this taxonomy was drawn from everyday language and can be used for descriptive, diagnostic, and theoretical purposes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Toward a Taxonomy of Gendered Sexuality|last = Devor|first = H|date = 1994|journal = Journal of Psychology and Human Sexuality, 6, 23-55.|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Basic Taxonomy of Gendered Sexuality.png|centre|thumb|1000 px|A taxonomy of gendered sexuality]]

=== Biological taxonomy ===
A taxonomy of gender also includes biological classifications of a range of sexual characteristics, which develop over one’s life cycle. The purely biological level of classifications includes chromosomes, which categorize female sex chromosome abnormalities and male sex chromosome abnormalities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Human Chromosomal Abnormalities:  Sex Chromosome Abnormalities |url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/abnormal/abnormal_5.htm |website=anthro.palomar.edu |access-date=2016-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302160316/http://anthro.palomar.edu/abnormal/abnormal_5.htm |archivedate=2016-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Turner Syndrome''' is a result from one of female sex chromosome abnormalities. Females inherit only one X chromosome (genotype is X0). Many do not survive birth and if they do they are shorter in stature and usually lack secondary female sexual characteristics.  Their ovaries do not develop properly so they are sterile.  If given estrogen replacement therapy around the age of puberty, women with Turner syndrome appear relatively normal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*'''Triple-X Syndrome''' is another syndrome that occurs from a female sex chromosome abnormality. Females inherit three or more X chromosomes (genotype is XXX).  These “super-females” or “meta-females” appear normal except for their unusually long legs and slender torsos.  They tend to be emotionally immature for their size but emotionally mature in relation to girls their same age. They sometimes have learning difficulties, usually in speech and language.  Women with Triple-X syndrome are fertile but can have premature ovarian failure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*'''Klinefelter Syndrome''' is a syndrome resulting from a male sex chromosome abnormality. Males inherit one or more extra X chromosomes (genotype is XXY).  They have higher-pitched voices with little facial and body hair.  In childhood, they have learning difficulties and are more likely to be overweight.  Boys are usually given testosterone at the age of puberty and often sterile. Men with Down syndrome sometimes also have Klinefelter syndrome.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*'''XYY Syndrome''' is also a syndrome resulting from a male sex chromosome abnormality. Males inherit an extra Y chromosome (genotype is XYY). These “super-males” appear normal but are usually taller and produce higher levels of testosterone. In childhood they are more slender, have severe acne, are very uncoordinated, and have below average intelligence. Males with XYY syndrome are fertile and are not often aware that they have an abnormality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{Jainism}}
{{God|by religion}}
In [[Jainism]], godliness is said to be the inherent quality of every [[jiva|soul]]. This quality, however, is subdued by the soul's association with karmic matter. All souls who have achieved the natural state of infinite bliss, infinite knowledge (''[[kevala jnana]]''), infinite power and infinite perception are regarded as '''God in Jainism'''. Jainism rejects the idea of a [[creator deity]] responsible for the manifestation, creation, or maintenance of this universe. According to Jain doctrine, the universe and its constituents (soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion) have [[Jainism and non-creationism|always existed]]. All the constituents and actions are governed by universal natural laws and perfect soul, an [[wikt:immaterial|immaterial entity]] cannot create or affect a material entity like the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jainworld.com/scriptures/niyamsara.asp ''The Perfect Law''] Jainworld.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
From the essential perspective, the soul of every living organism is perfect in every way, is independent of any actions of the organism, and is considered God or to have godliness. But the epithet of God is given to the soul in whom its properties manifest in accordance with its inherent nature. There are [[Jain philosophy#Infinity|countably infinite]] souls in the universe.

According to ''[[Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra]]'' (a major Jain text):&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=The Ratna Karanda Sravakachara | publisher=The Central Jaina Publishing House|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ratna_karanda_sravakachara.html?id=kLAlAQAAIAAJ | archive-url=https://archive.org/details/TheRatnaKarandaSravakachara | archive-date=2015 | date=1917 | author=Jain, Champat Rai|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:आप्तेनो च्छिनदोषेण सर्वज्ञेनागमेशिना।
:भवितव्यं नियोगेन नान्यथा ह्याप्तता भवेत्।।५।

:In the nature of things the true God should be free from the faults and weaknesses of the lower nature; [he should be] the knower of all things and the revealer of dharma; in no other way can divinity be constituted.

:क्षुत्पिपासाजराजरातक्ड जन्मान्तकभयस्मयाः।
:न रागद्वेषमोहाश्च यस्याप्तः स प्रकीर्त्यते ।।६।।
:He alone who is free from hunger, thirst, senility, disease, birth, death, fear, pride, attachment, aversion, infatuation, worry, conceit, hatred, uneasiness, sweat, sleep and surprise is called a God.

== Godliness ==
In Jainism, godliness is said to be the inherent quality of every soul (or every living organism) characterizing infinite bliss, infinite power, ''[[Kevala Jnana]]'' (pure infinite knowledge),{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=164}} infinite perception, and perfect manifestations of (countably) infinite other attributes. There are two possible views after this point. One is to look at the soul from the perspective of the soul itself. This entails explanations of the properties of the soul, its exact structure, composition and nature, the nature of various states that arise from it and their source attributes as is done in the deep and arcane texts of [[Samayasāra]], [[Niyamasara]] and [[Pravachanasara]]. Another view is to consider things apart from the soul and its relationships with the soul. According to this view, the qualities of a soul are subdued due to [[Karma in Jainism|karmas]] of the soul. ''Karmas'' are the fundamental particles of nature in Jainism. One who achieves this state of soul through [[Ratnatraya|right belief, right knowledge and right conduct]] can be termed a god. This perfection of soul is called ''Kevalin''. A god thus becomes a liberated soul – liberated of miseries, cycles of rebirth, world, ''karmas'' and finally liberated of body as well. This is called ''nirvana'' or ''[[Moksa (Jainism)|moksha]]''.

Jainism does not teach the dependency on any [[God|supreme being]] for enlightenment. The Tirthankara is a guide and teacher who points the way to enlightenment, but the struggle for enlightenment is one's own. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the [[cosmos]]; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.

Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation from all karmic bonding, one must practice the ethical principles not only in thought, but also in words (speech) and action. Such a practice through lifelong work towards oneself is regarded as observing the ''[[Mahavrata]]'' ("Great Vows").

Gods can be thus categorized into embodied gods also known as ''arihantas'' and non-embodied formless gods who are called ''Siddhas''. Jainism considers the ''devīs'' and ''devas'' to be souls who dwell in heavens owing to meritorious deeds in their past lives. These souls are in heavens for a fixed lifespan and even they have to undergo reincarnation as humans to achieve ''moksha''.

Thus, there are infinite gods in Jainism, all equivalent, liberated, and infinite in the manifestation of all attributes. The Self and karmas are separate substances in Jainism, the former living and the latter non-living. The attainment of [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] and the one who exists in such a state, then those who have achieved such a state can be termed gods. Therefore, beings ([[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]]) who've attained omniscience (''kevala jnana'') are worshipped as gods. The quality of godliness is one and the same in all of them. Jainism is sometimes regarded as a [[Transtheism|transtheistic]] religion,{{sfn|Zimmer|1953|p=182}} though it can be [[atheistic]] or [[polytheistic]] based on the way one defines "God".

== Five supreme beings ==
{{Main|Pañca-Parameṣṭhi}}
[[File:पंच परमेष्ठी.jpg|thumb|Stella depicting ''Pañca-Parameṣṭhi'' (five supreme beings) worthy of veneration as per Jainism]]
In Jainism, the ''Pañca-Parameṣṭhi'' (Sanskrit for "five supreme beings") are a fivefold hierarchy of religious authorities worthy of veneration. The five supreme beings are:
# ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]]''
# ''[[Siddha#Jainism|Siddha]]''
# ''[[Acharya (Jainism)|Acharya]]'' (Head of the monastic order)
# ''[[Upajjhaya|Upadhyaya]]'' ("Preceptor of less advanced ascetics")
# ''Muni'' or ''[[Jain monasticism|Jain monks]]''

== Arihant ==
{{Main|Arihant (Jainism)}}
A human being who conquers all inner passions and possesses infinite right knowledge (''[[Kevala Jnana]]'') is revered as an ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|arihant]]'' in [[Jainism]].{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=15}} They are also called ''Jinas'' (conquerors) or ''Kevalin'' (omniscient beings). An arihant is a soul who has destroyed all passions, is totally unattached and without any desire and hence is able to destroy the four ''[[Karma in Jainism#Ghatiya karmas|ghātiyā karmas]]'' and attain ''kevala jñāna'', or omniscience. Such a soul still has a body and four ''[[Karma in Jainism#Aghatiya karmas|aghātiyā karmas]]''. ''Arihantas'', at the end of their human life-span, destroy all remaining ''aghātiyā karmas'' and attain Siddhahood. There are two kinds of ''kevalin'' or  ''arihant'':{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=16}}
* ''Sāmānya Kevalin''–Ordinary victors, who are concerned with their own salvation.
* ''Tirthankara Kevalin''–Twenty-four human spiritual guides (teaching gods), who show the true path to salvation.{{sfn|Rankin|2013|p=40}}

{{Main|Tirthankara}}
[[File:Vardhaman Keezhakuyilkudi.jpg|thumb|Image of Vardhamana Mahavira, the 24th and last Tirthankara (Photo:[[Samanar Hills]])]]
The word ''Tīrthaṅkara'' signifies the founder of a ''tirtha'' which means a fordable passage across a sea. The ''Tirthankara'' show the 'fordable path' across the sea of interminable births and deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Jain|first=Champat Rai|title=Jainism, Christianity and Science|publisher=The Indian Press, Allahabad|date=1930|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=emsrAAAAIAAJ|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/JainismChristianityAndScience|archive-date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jain philosophy]] divides the wheel of time in two halves, ''Utsarpiṇī'' or ascending time cycle and ''[[avasarpiṇī]]'', the descending time cycle. Exactly 24 ''Tirthankara'' are said to grace each half of the cosmic time cycle.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=16-17}} '' ''[[Rishabhanatha]]'' was the first ''Tirthankara'' and [[Mahavira]] was the last ''Tirthankara'' of ''avasarpiṇī''.{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=16-17}}

''Tirthankara'' revive the fourfold order of ''Shraman, Shramani, [[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|Śrāvaka]], and Śrāvika'' called ''sangha''. [[Tirthankara]]'' can be called teaching gods who teach the [[Jain philosophy]]. However it would be a mistake to regard the ''tirthankara'' as gods analogous to the gods of the [[Hindu]] pantheon despite the superficial resemblances between Jain and Hindu ways of worship.&lt;ref&gt;Thrower (1980), p.93&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tirthankara'', being liberated, are beyond any kind of transactions with the rest of the universe. They are ''not'' the beings who exercise any sort of creative activity or who have the capacity or ability to intervene in answers to prayers.

''Tirthamkara-nama-karma'' is a special type of ''karma'', bondage of which raises a soul to the supreme status of a ''tirthankara''.{{sfn|Jain|1917|p=48}}

== Siddhas ==
{{Main|Siddha}}
[[File:Siddha idol.jpg|thumb|left|Although the ''siddhas'' (the liberated beings) are formless and without a body, this is how the [[Jain temple]]s often depict them.]]
Ultimately all ''arihantas'' become ''siddhas'', or liberated souls, at the time of their [[Nirvana (Jainism)|nirvana]]. A ''siddha'' is a soul who is permanently liberated from the [[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|transmigratory cycle of birth and death]]. Such a soul, having realized its true self, is free from all the ''Karmas'' and embodiment. They are formless and dwell in ''[[Siddhashila]]'' (the realm of the liberated beings) at the apex of the universe in infinite bliss, infinite perception, infinite knowledge and infinite energy.

The [[Acharanga Sutra]] 1.197 describes ''siddhas'' in this way:
{{quote|The liberated soul is not long nor small nor round nor triangular nor quadrangular nor circular; it is not black nor blue nor red nor green nor white; neither of good nor bad smell; not bitter nor pungent nor astringent nor sweet; neither rough nor soft; neither heavy nor light; neither cold nor hot; neither harsh nor smooth; it is without body, without resurrection, without contact (of matter), it is not feminine nor masculine nor neuter. The siddha perceives and knows all, yet is beyond comparison. Its essence is without form; there is no condition of the unconditioned. It is not sound, not colour, not smell, not taste, not touch or anything of that kind. Thus I say.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobi (1884) Retrieved on : 25 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/cite&gt;}}

[[File:Siddha Shila.svg|400px|thumb|Siddhashila as per the [[Jain cosmology]]]]
Siddhahood is the ultimate goal of all souls. There are infinite souls who have become ''siddhas'' and infinite more who will attain this state of liberation.{{Ref_label|D|d|none}} According to Jainism, Godhood is not a monopoly of some omnipotent and powerful being(s). All souls, with right perception, knowledge and conduct can achieve self-realisation and attain this state. Once achieving this state of infinite bliss and having destroyed all desires, the soul is not concerned with worldly matters and does not interfere in the working of the universe, as any activity or desire to interfere will once again result in influx of karmas and thus loss of liberation.

Jains pray to these passionless Gods not for any favors or rewards but rather pray to the qualities of the God with the objective of destroying the ''karmas'' and achieving the Godhood. This is best understood by the term ''vandetadgunalabhdhaye'' – i.e. "we pray to the attributes of such Gods to acquire such attributes" {{Ref_label|F|f|none}}&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar (2005b), p.35 Gāthā 1.29&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Anne Vallely:
{{quote|Jainism is not a religion of coming down. In Jainism it is we who must go up. We only have to help ourselves. In Jainism we have to become God. That is the only thing.&lt;ref name="Anne"&gt;Vallely, Anne (1980).  In: ''Guardians of the Transcendent: An Ethnology of a Jain Ascetic Community''. University of Toronto Press: Toronto .p.182&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Heavenly beings ==
{{main|Deva (Jainism)}}
[[File:Padmavati.JPG|thumb|Idol of [[Padmavati (Jainism)|Padmāvatī]] devī, śāsanadevī of Lord [[Parshvanatha]] at Walkeshwar Temple. She is one of the most popular demi-goddess amongst the Jains. According to Digambar Terapanth, worship of such deities is considered as ''mithyātva'' or wrong belief. However, in the Bispanthi Digambar tradition and the Shwetambar tradition, Padmavati is a popular Jain goddess.]]
[[Jain cosmology]] offers an elaborate description of heavenly beings (''devas''), but these beings are neither viewed as creators nor as Gods; they are subject to suffering and change like all other living beings, and must eventually die.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Jainism describes existence of ''śāsanadevatās'' and ''śāsanadevīs'', the attendants of a ''Tirthankara'', who create the ''[[samavasarana]]'' or the divine preaching assembly of a ''Tirthankara''. Such heavenly beings are classified as:-
* ''Bhavanapatis'' – Deva dwelling in abodes
* ''Vyantaras'' – Intermediary devas
* ''Jyotiṣkas'' – Luminaries
* ''Vaimānikas'' – Astral devas

The souls on account of accumulation of meritorious ''karmas'' reincarnate in heavens as devas. Although their life span is quite long, after their merit ''[[Karma in Jainism|karmas]]'' are exhausted, they once again have to reincarnate back into the realms of humans, animals or [[Naraka (Jainism)|hells]] depending on their karmas. As these devas themselves are not liberated, they have attachments and passions and hence not worthy of worship.

Ācārya [[Hemachandra]] decries the worship of such devas:
{{quote|These heavenly beings (devas above) tainted with attachment and passion; having women and weapons by their side, favour some and disfavour some; Such heavenly beings (devas) should not be worshipped by those who desire emancipation&lt;ref&gt;Gopani (1989), emended&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;}}
Worship of such devas is considered as ''[[mithyatva]]'' or wrong belief leading to bondage of karmas.

==Jain opposition to creationism==
{{main|Jainism and non-creationism}}
Jain scriptures reject God as the creator of the universe. Further, it asserts that no God is responsible or causal for actions in the life of any living organism. Ācārya Hemacandra in the 12th century put forth the Jain view of the universe in the ''[[Yogaśāstra]]'':&lt;ref&gt;http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002500819&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|This universe is not created nor sustained by anyone;
It is self-sustaining, without any base or support}}

Besides scriptural authority, Jains also resorted to [[syllogism]] and [[deductive reasoning]] to refute the creationist theories. Various views on divinity and the universe held by the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedics]], [[samkhya]]s, [[mīmāṃsā]]s, [[Buddhists]] and other schools of thought were analyzed, debated and repudiated by various Jain Ācāryas. However, the most eloquent refutation of this view is provided by Ācārya [[Jinasena]] in [[Adipurana|Mahāpurāna]],&lt;ref&gt;''Afterword on Jinasena'', D. Lakey, ''[[The Philosophical Forum]]'', Volume 33 Issue 3 Page 343-344 - Fall 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Primal Myths: Creating the World'', Barbara Sproul, http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/isbn/0060675004/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PDF of the text - http://www.jaina.org/?page=jainbooks&lt;/ref&gt; which was quoted by [[Carl Sagan]] in his book ''[[Cosmos (book)|Cosmos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.angelfire.com/blog2/endovelico/CarlSagan-Cosmos.pdf on page 140&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Some foolish men declare that creator made the world. The doctrine that the world was created is ill advised and should be rejected.
If God created the world, where was he before the creation? If you say he was transcendent then and needed no support, where is he now?
How could God have made this world without any raw material? If you say that he made this first, and then the world, you are faced with an endless regression.

If you declare that this raw material arose naturally you fall into another fallacy, for the whole universe might thus have been its own creator, and have arisen quite naturally.

If God created the world by an act of his own will, without any raw material, then it is just his will and nothing else — and who will believe this silly nonsense?

If he is ever perfect and complete, how could the will to create have arisen in him? If, on the other hand, he is not perfect, he could no more create the universe than a potter could.

If he is form-less, action-less and all-embracing, how could he have created the world? Such a soul, devoid of all modality, would have no desire to create anything.

If he is perfect, he does not strive for the three aims of man, so what advantage would he gain by creating the universe?

If you say that he created to no purpose because it was his nature to do so, then God is pointless. If he created in some kind of sport, it was the sport of a foolish child, leading to trouble.

If he created because of the karma of embodied beings (acquired in a previous creation), then he is not the Almighty Lord, but subordinate to something else.

If out of love for living beings and need of them he made the world, why did he not make creation wholly blissful free from misfortune?

If he were transcendent he would not create, for he would be free: Nor if involved in transmigration, for then he would not be almighty. Thus the doctrine that the world was created by God makes no sense at all.

And God commits great sin in slaying the children whom he himself created. If you say that he slays only to destroy evil beings, why did he create such beings in the first place?

Good men should combat the believer in divine creation, maddened by an evil doctrine. Know that the world is uncreated, as time itself is, without beginning or end, and is based on the principles, life and rest. Uncreated and indestructible, it endures under the compulsion of its own nature.}}

The '''Grinberg Method''' is described as "a structured way of teaching through the body".&lt;ref name=Grinbass&gt;{{cite web|last=Grinberg|first=Avi|title=About the Grinberg Method|url=http://www.grinbergmethod.com/about-us.asp|publisher=International Association of GM Practitioners|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on [[process of embodiment (physical theatre)|body attention]], [[perception]] and the individual's direct personal experience. The goal is for people to learn to be attentive to themselves and their surroundings, and stop automatic limiting [[habit (psychology)|habits]] in order to increase their ability to recuperate, attain personal goals and [[well-being]]. The method was developed in the early 1980s by Avi Grinberg.&lt;ref name="Jewish Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Afra|first=Orit|title=Mind, body and sole|journal=Jewish Journal|date=2011-06-28|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/health/article/mind_body_and_sole_20110628|accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The Grinberg Method was developed by Avi Grinberg, who claimed that people lacked the ability to use their natural capacity for self-healing and to prevent conditions that diminish their quality of life.&lt;ref name="about the founder"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the founder|url=http://www.grinbergmethod.com/about-the-founder.asp|publisher=Grinberg Method.com|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described his observations and reasoning in the book ''Fear, Pain and Some Other Friends''.&lt;ref name="about the founder" /&gt;

== Concepts of the method ==

=== Shifting attention from mind to body ===
His method focuses on body attention based on the view that life is experienced by the body - people's thoughts, actions, feelings and sensations are all expressed in and through the body.&lt;ref&gt;"The body gets specific emphasis because it is seen as the place and medium of all experience. The human being is anchored in the body and is in fact identical with it. Any experience is inseparable from the body, any mental or emotional process has physical correlates...". {{cite book|last=Viermann|first=Birte|title=Evaluation of treatments for the Neck and Shoulders according to the Grinberg Method - Effects of a Body-Oriented Method with a Pedagogic Approach|year=2003|publisher=University of Bielfeld, Germany|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Body attention, on his view, is non-verbal and is the experience itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grinberg|first=Avi|title=Fear, Pain and some other friends|year=1994|publisher=Astrolog|location=Hod Hasharon|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his  method, uninterrupted, the body will display the natural, inherent inclination to take care of itself, heal, adapt to an ever-changing reality, develop and be fulfilled, thus constantly aiming to reach closer to a state of [[Wellness (alternative medicine)|well-being]].&lt;ref name="Lowen, M.D. 1980 42"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowen, M.D.|first=Alexander|title=Fear of Life - A Therapy for Being|year=1980|publisher=Bioenergetics Press|location=USA|isbn=0-9743737-0-2|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stopping patterns of behavior ===
The methodology consists of noticing and clarifying what is happening routinely and "then having the willingness and ability to stop it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic concepts|url=http://www.grinbergmethod.com/basic-concepts.asp|publisher=Grinberg Method.com|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method focuses on a recurring reaction and pattern of behavior of the individual in relation to a routine situation which one wants to alter, maintaining that what a person can really control and be responsible for, is his own reaction. ''Stopping'' is a physical act done with body attention, will and choice, to discontinue the part of the experience that one can perceive and control. For example: a person is scared while studying for an exam and reacts with shallow breathing, contracting the shoulders and diaphragm, locking the knees, becoming worried, and disliking situation. By paying attention to one's body and learning to purposefully reproduce and to stop all these behavior, "...the person can choose to refuse the reaction, relax the shoulders and diaphragm, unlock the knees, breathe differently and stop judging and blaming".&lt;ref name="Lowen, M.D. 1980 42"/&gt; ''Letting the body work'' is a term used to describe the act of allowing the body to function more freely and rebalance itself.&lt;ref&gt;"I remind my clients...to go back to their breathing, because it raises their level of energy and allows them to feel their bodies more". It's possible then that clients might start to cry or to tremble. "This is the language of the body when it is allowed to speak. Then the body is able to arrange itself with all the new energy" explains the Grinberg teacher". {{cite web|last=Hauner|first=Philipp|title=Die Grinberg-Methode. Massage für die Seele ("Massage for the Soul")|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/gesundheit/die-grinberg-methode-massage-fuer-die-seele/1357156.html|publisher=Der Tagesspiegel|accessdate=24 June 2012}}(translation: Emily Poel)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal history ===
According to Grinberg, to continue habits automatically is to repeat history, not to perceive reality directly now but rather through filters of the inner-world that include past conclusions and beliefs, old fear and pain, recurring moods etc. The idea of an unresolved or "open" issue actually refers to a state of past imbalance that was never corrected, and which resurfaces repeatedly, as an "open-ended [[gestalt therapy|gestalt]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grinberg|first=Avi|title=Foot Analysis. The Foot Path to Self-discovery|year=1993|publisher=Samuel Weiser|location=York Beach, Maine|isbn=978-0877287803|pages=320, 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relating to personal history through the body is focused on stopping behaviors that are not relevant to one's present life.&lt;ref&gt;"Therapy cannot eradicate the past. It deals with the past in terms of its effect on the present". Lowen,1980, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fear ===
According to the method, [[fear]] is a natural protection mechanism, an integral capacity that enables recognition of potential threat. Fear triggers various physical responses that alert, energize and enable quick and relevant action in a dangerous situation. While fear appears at the moment danger arises, human beings can anticipate a fearful event that might happen and trigger a similar response although nothing dangerous is happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Layton|first=Julia|title=Why Do We Fear?|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/life/inside-the-mind/emotions/fear3.htm|work=How Fear Works|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flowers|first=Alison|title=Fearing fear perpetuates fear, psychologist says|url=http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=101455|work=Medill Reports -Chicago|publisher=Medill school|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last=Reid|first=Natasha|title=The stress buster|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/may/08/healthandwellbeing.health2|accessdate=29 September 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=8/5/2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fear in the Grinberg Method|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/episode/0,,16066632,00.html#16217183|work=Deutschen Welle radio show in English|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pain ===
Grinberg views [[pain]] as a major part of the [[human condition]].&lt;ref name="Transforming Pain"&gt;{{cite web|title=Transforming Pain|url=http://www.grinbergmethod.com/pdf/Transforming_pain.pdf|publisher=Grinberg Method.com|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims even though pain is a natural part of life, the body can accommodate and transform it. People often do not know how to let the body deal with pain, consequently it generates fear and efforts to avoid it.&lt;ref name="Transforming Pain" /&gt; Practicing the methodology is intended to teach people to gain control and stop trying to avoid the pain, to be fully attentive to their body and experience of it. When this occurs, energy is freed to deal with the pain and related sensations, giving the body an opportunity to mend and heal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online personal lesson of working with pain|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nar6PYcGYeE|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This can be applied to any form of pain or discomfort, and regular focused practice can develop more confidence and courage to cope in painful circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pain in the Grinberg Method|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/episode/0,,16066506,00.html#16197111|work=Deutschen Welle radio show in English|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Profession ==
To qualify as a Grinberg Method practitioner, students complete a three years program of at least 990 academic hours of study and training. To advance to the second and third year of studies, students have to pass a supervision meeting with a Licensed Teacher, for which they get a certificate for their learning stage (Practitioner Level 1 and 2). At the end of their third year, students demonstrate their work with clients in two supervised meetings, submit two training programs and complete the graduation requirements as set by the Supervisory Academic Board of the Grinberg Method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who we are|url=http://www.grinbergmethod.com/who-we-are.asp|publisher=Grinberg Method.com|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following satisfactory fulfillment of these conditions, they receive a Diploma of Qualified Practitioner, and can join the International Association of Grinberg Method Practitioners (IAGMP) and continue to post-graduate advanced courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional Studies|url=http://www.grinbergmethod.com/professional-studies.asp|publisher=Grinberg Method.com|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
In 2012 Danièle Muller, President of the Swiss Association for the Defense of the Family and the Individual (ASDFI), claimed to have received testimonials from people who have completed the training to become Grinberg trainers. According to Muller, they say that the leaders of the method intervened in their private lives, they drift from their friends and their families, investing all their time and money "in promoting the method."
A psychiatrist who deals with the treatment of victims of sectarian derivals claims to have worked with several former members and according to her at Grinberg this is what is taught: "Your body knows a truth about yourself that your head ignores, and me, the therapist, masseur, I will tell you what your body feels". For the psychiatrist it is destructive of any possible private sphere and there is no possibility to keep a safe distance between the patient and the therapist.&lt;ref name=UNADFI&gt;"[http://www.unadfi.org/d-anciens-praticiens-de-la-methode Union Nationale des Associations de Défense des Familles et de l'individu Victimes de Sectes]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12784">A '''harem''' is an animal group consisting of one or two males, a number of females, and their offspring. The dominant male drives off other males and maintains the unity of the group. If present, the second male is subservient to the dominant male. As juvenile males grow, they leave the group and roam as solitary individuals or join bachelor herds. Females in the group may be inter-related. The dominant male mates with the females as they become sexually active and drives off competitors, until he is displaced by another male. In some species, incoming males that achieve dominant status may commit [[Infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]].

For the male, the main benefits of the harem system is obtaining exclusive access to a group of mature females. The females benefit from being in a stable social group and the associated benefits of grooming, predator avoidance and cooperative defense of territory. The disadvantages for the male are the energetic costs of gaining or defending a harem which may leave him with reduced [[reproductive success]]. The females are disadvantaged if their offspring are killed during dominance battles or by incoming males.

==Overview== 
The term '''harem''' is used in [[zoology]] to distinguish social organization consisting of a group of females, their offspring, and one to two males.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;Maestripieri, Dario; Mayhew, Jessica; Carlson, Cindy L.; Hoffman, Christy L.; and Radtke, Jennifer 	M.

Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The single male, called the dominant male, may be accompanied by another young male, called a "follower" male. Females that more closely associate with the dominant male are called "central females," while females who associate less frequently with the dominant male are called "peripheral females."&lt;ref name="twelve"&gt;Kummer, Hans. Social Organization of Hamadryas Baboons. A Field Study. Basel: Karger, (1968.) Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenile male offspring leave the harem and live either solitarily, or, with other young males in groups known as [[bachelor herd]]s.&lt;ref name="thirteen"&gt;David, J. H. M.

Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Sexually mature female offspring may stay within their natal harem, or may join another harem.&lt;ref name="fourteen"&gt;Qi, Xiao-Guang; Li, Bau-Guo; Garber, Paul A.; Ji, Weihong; and Wanatabe, Kunio.

American Journal of Primatology 71 (2009): 670-79. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The females in a harem may be, but are not exclusively, genetically related.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seven" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fifteen"&gt;Greenwood, Paul J.

Print.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the females in [[hamadryas baboon]] harems are not usually genetically related because their harems are formed by "kidnapping" females from other harems and subsequent [[herding]].&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; In contrast, [[gelada]] harems are based on kinship ties to genetically related females.&lt;ref name="sixteen"&gt;Mori, Akio; Iwamoto, Toshitaka; Mori, Umeyo; and  Bekele, Afework. "[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02557559 Sociological and Demographic Characteristics of a Recently Found Arsi Gelada Population in Ethiopia]." Primates 40.2 (1999): 365-81. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple harems may assemble into larger groups known as "clans" or "teams".&lt;ref name="seventeen"&gt;Schreier, Amy L.; and Swedell, Larissa.

American Journal of Primatology 71.11 (2009): 948-55. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harem cohesiveness is mediated by the dominant male who fights off invading males to keep claim over the harem.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt;&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; In some harem-forming species, when a dominant male vacates his harem (due to death, defection to another harem, or usurpation) the incoming male sometimes commits [[infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]] of the offspring.&lt;ref name="eighteen"&gt;Swedell, Larissa; and Tesfaye, Teklu .

Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Because time and resources are no longer being devoted to the offspring, infanticide often stimulates the female to return to sexual receptivity and fertility sooner than if the offspring were to survive.  Furthermore, while lactating, females do not ovulate and consequently are not fertile. Infanticide therefore has the potential to increase the incoming male's [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref name="eighteen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="five"&gt;Horev, Aviad; Yosef, Reuven; Tryjanowski, Piotr; and Ovidia; Ofer. "[https://www.academia.edu/download/45651910/Consequences_of_variation_in_male_harem_20160515-406-1duslv1.pdf Consequences of Variation in Male Harem Size to Population Persistence: Modeling Poaching and Extinction Risk of Bengal Tigers (Panthera Tigris)]." Biological Conservation 147.1 (2012): 22-31. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
Harems are beneficial social structure for the dominant male, as it allows him access to several reproductively available females at a time.&lt;ref name="four" /&gt; Harems provide protection for the females within a particular harem, as dominant males will fiercely ward off potential invaders.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; This level of protection may also, such in the case of the [[common pheasant]], reduce the energy in female expended on remaining alert to, or fleeing from, invading males.&lt;ref name="eight" /&gt; Harems allow bonding and socialization among the female members, which can result in greater control over access to females as determined by the females' preferences. Harems also facilitate socialized behavior such as [[social grooming|grooming]] and cooperative defense of territory.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nineteen"&gt;Searcy, William A.; and Yasukawa, Ken. "[https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/284984 Alternative Models of Territorial Polygyny in Birds]." The American Naturalist 134.3 (1989): 323-43. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Costs ==
{{further|Alternative mating strategy}}

Harems can prove energetically costly for both males and females. Males spend substantial amounts of energy engaging in battles to invade a harem, or to keep hold of a harem once dominance has been established.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt; Such energy expenditure can result in reduced [[reproductive success]] such in the case of [[red deer]].&lt;ref name="three" /&gt; This is especially true when there is high turnover rates of dominant males, as frequent intense fighting can result in great expenditure of energy.&lt;ref name="three" /&gt; High turnover rate of dominant males can also be energetically costly for the females as their offspring are frequently killed in harems where [[infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]] occurs. Harems can also negatively affect females if there is intra-harem competition among females for resources.&lt;ref name="ten" /&gt;

{{anchor|Kleptogyny}}{{anchor|Sneaky fucker}}
A lower-cost [[alternative mating strategy]], useful to bachelors without a harem, is kleptogyny or the "sneaky fucker strategy",{{efn|The term was coined by the evolutionary biologist [[John Maynard Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pallen|first=Mark|title=The Rough Guide to Evolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFBgeD0jEDAC&amp;pg=PT182|year=2011|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-4093-5855-8|pages=182–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Cherfas/&gt; sneaking in to mate while the harem owner is distracted: in the case of [[red deer]], when the harem stag is involved in a fight with another older stag.&lt;ref name=Cherfas&gt;{{cite news |last=Cherfas |first=Jeremy |title=The games animals play |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OIXrEXl3MuMC&amp;pg=PA673 |date=15 September 1977 |work=New Scientist |pages=672–673}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy is also recorded in the [[elephant seal]].&lt;ref name="Frankenhuis Fraley 2017 pp. 141–150"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Frankenhuis | first=Willem E. | last2=Fraley | first2=R.

'''Ḥeḥ''' (also '''Huh''', '''Hah''', '''Hauh''', '''Huah''', and '''Hehu'''{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}) was the personification of [[Infinity (philosophy)|infinity]] or [[eternity]] in the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]] in [[Egyptian mythology]].&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 109"&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H. (2003). ''The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt''. Thames &amp; Hudson. p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; His name originally meant "flood", referring to the watery chaos that the Egyptians believed existed before the [[Ancient Egyptian creation myths|creation of the world]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen, James P. ''Genesis in Egypt: The Philosophy of Ancient Egyptian Creation Accounts''. Yale Egyptological Seminar, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians envisioned this chaos as infinite, in contrast with the finite created world, so Heh personified this aspect of the primordial waters.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, James P. ''Middle Egyptian: An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs''. Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Heh's female counterpart was known as '''Hauhet''', which is simply the [[grammatical gender|feminine form]] of his name.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 109"/&gt;

Like the other concepts in the Ogdoad, his male form was often depicted as a [[frog]], or a frog-headed human, and his female form as a [[snake]] or snake-headed human. The frog head symbolised fertility, creation, and regeneration, and was also possessed by the other Ogdoad males Kek, Amun, and Nun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rush|first1=John|title=The Twelve Gates: A Spiritual Passage Through the Egyptian Books of the Dead|date=2007|publisher=Frog|location=Berkeley, CA|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other common representation depicts him crouching, holding a [[palm stem]] in each hand (or just one),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Owusu|first1=Heike|title=Egyptian Symbols|date=2008|publisher=Sterling|location=New York, NY|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes with a palm stem in his hair, as [[Palm tree|palm]] stems represented long life to the Egyptians, the years being represented by notches on it. Depictions of this form also had a [[shen ring]] at the base of each palm stem, which represented [[infinity]]. Depictions of Heh were also used in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] to represent one [[million]], which was essentially considered equivalent to infinity in [[Ancient Egyptian mathematics]]. Thus this deity is also known as the "god of millions of years". 

==Origins and mythology== 
The primary meaning of the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] word ''ḥeḥ'' was "million" or "millions"; a personification of this concept, Ḥeḥ, was adopted as the Egyptian god of infinity. With his female counterpart Ḥauḥet (or Ḥeḥut), Ḥeḥ represented one of the four god-goddess pairs comprising the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]], a pantheon of eight primeval deities whose worship was centred at [[Hermopolis Magna]].
The mythology of the Ogdoad describes its eight members, Heh and Hauhet, [[Nu (mythology)|Nu]] and [[Naunet]], [[Amun]] and [[Amaunet]], and [[Kuk (mythology)|Kuk]] and [[Kauket]], coming together in the cataclysmic event that gives rise to the sun (and its deific personification, [[Atum]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hart|first1=George|title=Egyptian Myths|date=1990|publisher=British Museum Publications|location=London|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms and iconography==
[[Image:Heh.svg|thumb|right|An aspect of Heh, holding a pair of notched palm branches]]
The god Ḥeḥ was usually depicted anthropomorphically, as in the hieroglyphic character, as a male figure with divine beard and lappet wig. Normally kneeling (one knee raised), sometimes in a basket—the sign for "all",  the god typically holds in each hand a notched palm branch (palm rib). (These were employed in the temples for ceremonial time-keeping, which use explains the use of the palm branch as the hieroglyphic symbol for ''rnp.t'', "year").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Remler|first1=Pat|title=Egyptian Mythology, A to Z|date=2010|publisher=Chelsea House|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, an additional palm branch is worn on the god's head.

In Ancient Egyptian Numerology, Gods such as Heh were used to represent numbers in a decimal point system. Particularly, the number 1,000,000 is depicted in the hieroglyph of Heh, who is position in his normal seated position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Imhausen|first1=Annette|authorlink=Annette Imhausen|title=Mathematics of Ancient Egypt|date=2016|publisher=Princeton University|location=Princeton|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult and worship==
The personified, somewhat abstract god of eternity Ḥeḥ possessed no known cult centre or sanctuary; rather, his veneration revolved around symbolism and personal belief. The god's image and its iconographic elements reflected the wish for millions of years of life or rule; as such, the figure of Ḥeḥ finds frequent representation in amulets, prestige items and royal iconography from the late [[Old Kingdom]] period onwards. Heh became associated with the King and his quest for longevity. For instance, he appears on the tomb of King Tutankhamen, in two cartouches, where he is crowned with a winged scarab beetle, symbolizing existence and a sun disk. The placement of Heh in relation to King Tutankhamen's corpse means he will be granting him these "millions of years" into the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Remler|first1=Pat|title=Egyptian Mythology, A to Z|date=2010|publisher=Chelsea House|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Homo sapiens idaltu''''' ({{lang-aa|Idaltu}}; "elder" or "first born"&lt;ref name="White03" /&gt;), also called '''Herto Man''',&lt;ref name="White03" /&gt; is the name given to a number of [[hominin]] fossils found in 1997 in [[Herto Bouri]], [[Ethiopia]]. They date to around 160,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/06/11_idaltu.shtml  |title= 160,000-year-old fossilized skulls uncovered in Ethiopia are oldest anatomically modern humans | publisher= UC Berkeley |date=June 11, 2003  |accessdate=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paleoanthropologists determined that the skeletal finds belong to an extinct subspecies of ''Homo sapiens'' who lived in [[Pleistocene]] Africa. In the narrow definition of ''H. sapiens'', the subspecies ''H. s. idaltu'' falls under the umbrella of [[Homo sapiens#Anatomical modernity|Anatomically modern humans]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Sanders, [http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/06/11_idaltu.shtml 160,000-year-old fossilized skulls uncovered in Ethiopia are oldest anatomically modern humans], | 11 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The recognition of ''H. s. idaltu'' as a [[Human subspecies|valid subspecies]] of the anatomically modern human lineage would justify the description of contemporary humans with the subspecies name ''H. s. sapiens''.

==Discovery==
{{Human timeline}}
The [[fossil]]ized remains of ''Homo sapiens idaltu'' were discovered at [[Herto Bouri]] near the [[Middle Awash]] site of [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Afar Triangle]] in 1997 by [[Tim D. White|Tim White]], but were first unveiled in 2003.&lt;ref name="White03"/&gt; Herto Bouri is a region of Ethiopia under volcanic layers. According to [[radioisotope dating]], the layers are between 154,000 and 160,000 years old. Three well preserved crania are accounted for, the best preserved being from an adult male (BOU-VP-16/1) having a brain capacity of {{convert|1450|cm3|cuin|abbr=on}}. The other crania include another partial adult male and a six-year-old child.&lt;ref name="White03"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6941/full/nature01669.html  |title= Pleistocene Homo sapiens from Middle Awash, Ethiopia | doi=10.1038/nature01669 |accessdate=June 7, 2016 |volume=423 |issue=6941 |pmid=12802332 |date=June 2003 |journal=Nature |pages=742–7 | last1 = White | first1 = TD | last2 = Asfaw | first2 = B | last3 = DeGusta | first3 = D | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al|bibcode=2003Natur.423..742W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist [[Chris Stringer]] argued in a 2003 article in the journal ''Nature'' that "the skulls might not be distinctive enough to warrant a new subspecies name".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/index.html?file=/nature/journal/v423/n6941/full/423692a_fs.html  |title= Human evolution: Out of Ethiopia |journal= Nature |volume= 423 |issue= 6941 |pages= 693–695 |date=June 12, 2003  |accessdate=June 7, 2016|bibcode= 2003Natur.423..692S |last1= Stringer |first1= Chris |doi= 10.1038/423692a |pmid= 12802315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/herto.html  |title= Herto skulls (Homo sapiens idaltu) | publisher= talkorigins org |date=  |accessdate=June 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These specimens represent the direct ancestors of modern ''[[Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' which, according to the "[[Recent African origin of modern humans|recent African origin (RAO)]]" or "out of Africa" model, developed shortly after this period ([[Khoisan]] mitochondrial divergence dated not later than 110,000 [[Common Era|BCE]]) in [[Eastern Africa]]. "The many morphological features shared by the Herto crania and [[Anatomically modern Homo sapiens|AMHS]], to the exclusion of [[wikt:penecontemporaneous|penecontemporaneous]] [[Neanderthals]], provide additional fossil data excluding Neanderthals from a significant contribution to the ancestry of modern humans."&lt;ref name="White03"/&gt;

A 2005 [[potassium-argon dating]] of volcanic [[tuff]] associated with the Omo remains showed them to date from around 195,000 years ago. At the time of the dating, this made these fossils the earliest known remains of [[anatomically modern humans]], older than the ''idaltu'' specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=McDougall |first=I. |last2=Brown |first2=F.

A later study found that Herto man and his contemporaries were cranially similar to Oceanians, with Northern Melenesians being the closest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Reyes-Centeno|first=H. |last2=Hubbe|first2=M |last3=Hanihara|first3=T. |last4=Stringer|first4=C. |last5=Harvati|first5=K. |year=2015|title=Testing modern human out-of-Africa dispersal models and implications for modern human origins |journal=Journal of Human Evolution|volume=87  |pages=95–106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}

The '''id, ego, and super-ego''' are three distinct, yet interacting agents in the [[psychic apparatus]] defined in [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud's]] [[Ego psychology|structural model]] of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].

The three parts are the theoretical constructs in terms of whose activity and interaction our [[mental life]] is described. According to this Freudian model of the psyche, the id is the set of uncoordinated instinctual trends; the super-ego plays the critical and moralizing role; and the ego is the organized, realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the super-ego.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund. ''The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud.'' Vol. XIX. Translated from the German under the General Editorship of [[James Strachey]]. In collaboration with [[Anna Freud]]. Assisted by [[Alix Strachey]] and [[Alan Tyson]], Vintage, 1999. [Reprint.] {{ISBN|0-09-929622-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Freud explained:&lt;blockquote&gt;The functional importance of the ego is manifested in the fact that normally control over the approaches to motility devolves upon it. Thus in its relation to the id it is like a man on horseback, who has to hold in check the superior strength of the horse; with this difference, that the rider tries to do so with his own strength while the ego uses borrowed forces. The analogy may be carried a little further. Often a rider, if he is not to be parted from his horse, is obliged to guide it where it wants to go; so in the same way the ego is in the habit of transforming the id's will into action as if it were its own. (p. 19).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/965512|title=The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud. Volume XIX (1923-26) The Ego and the Id and Other Works|last=Freud, Sigmund|first=|date=|publisher=Hogarth Press|others=Strachey, James., Freud, Anna, 1895-1982,, Rothgeb, Carrie Lee, 1925-, Richards, Angela., Scientific Literature Corporation.|year=1978|isbn=0701200677|location=London,|pages=|oclc=965512}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Although the model is structural and makes reference to an apparatus, the id, ego and super-ego are purely [[psychological]] concepts and do not correspond to ([[Somatic nervous system|somatic]]) structures of the [[brain]] such as the kind dealt with by [[neuroscience]]. The super-ego is observable in how someone can view themselves as guilty, [[Evil|bad]], [[shameful]], weak, and feel compelled to do certain things. Freud in ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' discusses "the general character of harshness and cruelty exhibited by the [ego] ideal – its dictatorial 'Thou shalt.{{'"}}

Freud (1933) hypothesizes different levels of ego ideal or superego development with increasingly greater ideals:
{{quote|...nor must it be forgotten that a child has a different estimate of [their] parents at different periods of [their] life. At the time at which the [[Oedipus complex]] gives place to the super-ego they are something quite magnificent; but later they lose much of this. Identifications then come about with these later parents as well, and indeed they regularly make important contributions to the formation of character; but in that case they only affect the ego, they no longer influence the super-ego, which has been determined by the earliest parental images.|''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'', p. 64}}

The earlier in development, the greater the estimate of parental power. When one defuses into rivalry with the parental imago, then one feels the 'dictatorial thou shalt' to manifest the power the imago represents. Four general levels are found in Freud's work: the auto-erotic, the narcissistic, the anal, and the phallic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pederson|first1=Trevor|title=The Economics of Libido: Psychic Bisexuality, the Superego, and the Centrality of the Oedipus Complex|date=2015|publisher=Karnac}}&lt;/ref&gt; These different levels of development and the relations to parental imagos correspond to specific id forms of aggression and affection. For example, aggressive desires to decapitate, to dismember, to cannibalize, to swallow whole, to suck dry, to make disappear, to blow away, etc. animate myths, are enjoyed in fantasy and horror movies, and are observable in the fantasies and repressions of patients across cultures.  
      
The concepts themselves arose at a late stage in the development of Freud's thought as the "structural model" (which succeeded his "economic model" and "topographical model") and was first discussed in his 1920 essay ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'' and was formalized and elaborated upon three years later in his ''The Ego and the Id''. Freud's proposal was influenced by the ambiguity of the term "[[Unconscious mind|unconscious]]" and its many conflicting uses.

==Psychic apparatus ==
=== Id ===
The id ([[Latin]] for "it",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Id |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/id-psychology |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |date=February 22, 2016 |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-de|Es}})&lt;ref name="Es"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Laplanche |first2=Jean-Bertrand |last2=Pontalis |authorlink1=Jean Laplanche |authorlink2=Jean-Bertrand Pontalis |chapter=Id (pp. 197-9) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=197&amp;dq=%22Id+=+D.\+Es%22|title=The Language of Psycho-analysis |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;printsec=frontcover |publisher=Karnac Books |location=London |year=1988 |edition=reprint, revised |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=tV99AAAAMAAJ 1973] |isbn=978-0-946-43949-2 |id={{ISBN|0-94643949-4}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the disorganized part of the personality structure that contains a human's basic, instinctual drives. Id is the only component of personality that is present from birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cherry |first=Kendra |url=http://psychology.about.com/od/theoriesofpersonality/a/personalityelem.htm |title=Freud and the Id, Ego, and Superego |work=VeryWellMind.com |date=November 6, 2018 |accessdate=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the source of our bodily needs, wants, desires, and impulses, particularly our sexual and aggressive drives. The id contains the libido, which is the primary source of instinctual force that is unresponsive to the demands of reality.&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;Carlson, N. R. (19992000). Personality. Psychology: the science of behavior (Canandian ed., p. 453). Scarborough, Ont.: Allyn and Bacon Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; The id acts according to the "[[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]]"—the psychic force that motivates the tendency to seek immediate gratification of any impulse&lt;ref name="Schacter"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schacter |first=Daniel |title=Psychology Second Edition |year=2009 |publisher=[[Worth Publishers]] |location=New York City |isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2 |page=481}}&lt;/ref&gt;—defined as seeking to avoid pain or unpleasure (not "displeasure") aroused by increases in instinctual tension.&lt;ref name="Rycroft"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rycroft |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Rycroft |title=A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Freud the id is unconscious by definition:

{{quote|It is the dark, inaccessible part of our personality, what little we know of it we have learned from our study of the [[dreamwork]] and of course the construction of neurotic symptoms, and most of that is of a negative character and can be described only as a contrast to the ego. We approach the id with analogies: we call it a chaos, a cauldron full of seething excitations. ...It is filled with energy reaching it from the instincts, but it has no organization, produces no collective will, but only a striving to bring about the satisfaction of the instinctual needs subject to the observance of the pleasure principle.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933), ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis''. pp. 105–6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the id:

{{quote|...contrary impulses exist side by side, without cancelling each other out. ...There is nothing in the id that could be compared with negation...nothing in the id which corresponds to the idea of time.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Developmentally, the id precedes the ego; i.e., the psychic apparatus begins, at birth, as an undifferentiated id, part of which then develops into a structured ego. While "id" is in search of pleasure, "ego" emphasizes the principle of reality.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite article |last1=Lapsley |first1=Daniel K. |last2=Paul C.  |first2=Stey |title=Id, Ego, and Superego |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www3.nd.edu/~dlapsle1/Lab/Articles_%26_Chapters_files/Entry%2520for%2520Encyclopedia%2520of%2520Human%2520BehaviorFInal%2520Submitted%2520Formatted4.pdf |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-375000-6.00199-3}} Chapter of {{cite book |editor-last=Ramachandran |editor-first=Vilayanur S. |editor-link=V.

{{quote|...contains everything that is inherited, that is present at birth, is laid down in the constitution—above all, therefore, the instincts, which originate from the somatic organization, and which find a first psychical expression here (in the id) in forms unknown to us.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''An Outline of Psycho-analysis'' (1940)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The mind of a newborn child is regarded as completely "id-ridden", in the sense that it is a mass of instinctive drives and impulses, and needs immediate satisfaction. The "id" moves on to what organism needs. Example is reduction of tension which is experienced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The id "knows no judgements of value: no good and evil, no morality. ...Instinctual [[cathexis|cathexes]] seeking discharge—that, in our view, is all there is in the id."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; It is regarded as "the great reservoir of [[libido]]",&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "The Ego and the Id", ''On Metapsychology'' (Penguin Freud Library 11) p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; the instinctive drive to create—the life instincts that are crucial to pleasurable survival. Alongside the life instincts came the death instincts—the [[death drive]] which Freud articulated relatively late in his career in "the hypothesis of a ''death instinct'', the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; For Freud, "the death instinct would thus seem to express itself—though probably only in part—as an ''instinct of destruction'' directed against the external world and other organisms"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; through aggression. Freud considered that "the id, the whole person...originally includes all the instinctual impulses...the destructive instinct as well",&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Eros (concept)|eros]] or the life instincts.

=== Ego ===
The ego (Latin for "I",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ego |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/ego-philosophy-and-psychology |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=February 22, 2016 |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-de|Ich}})&lt;ref name="Ich"&gt;Laplanche, Jean; Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand (1988).

An example would be to resist the urge to grab other people's belongings, but instead to purchase those items.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner, Daniel (2011). ''Psychology'' (1. publ., 3. print. ed.). Cambridge: WorthPublishers. {{ISBN|978-1-429-24107-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ego is the organized part of the personality structure that includes defensive, perceptual, intellectual-cognitive, and executive functions. Conscious awareness resides in the ego, although not all of the operations of the ego are conscious. Originally, Freud used the word ego to mean a sense of self, but later revised it to mean a set of psychic functions such as judgment, tolerance, reality testing, control, planning, defense, synthesis of information, intellectual functioning, and memory.&lt;ref name="Snowden"&gt;{{cite book|title=Teach Yourself Freud|last=Snowden|first=Ruth|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-07-147274-6|pages=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ego separates out what is real. It helps us to organize our thoughts and make sense of them and the world around us.&lt;ref name="Snowden"/&gt; "The ego is that part of the id which has been modified by the direct influence of the external world. ...The ego represents what may be called reason and common sense, in contrast to the id, which contains the passions...in its relation to the id it is like a person on horseback, who has to hold in check the superior strength of the horse; with this difference, that the rider tries to do so with their own strength, while the ego uses borrowed forces."&lt;ref&gt;Freud,''The Ego and the Id'', ''On Metapsychology'' pp. 363–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Still worse, "it serves three severe masters...the external world, the super-ego and the id."&lt;ref name="Freud, p. 110"/&gt; Its task is to find a balance between primitive drives and reality while satisfying the id and super-ego. Its main concern is with the individual's safety and allows some of the id's desires to be expressed, but only when consequences of these actions are marginal. "Thus the ego, driven by the id, confined by the super-ego, repulsed by reality, struggles...[in] bringing about harmony among the forces and influences working in and upon it," and readily "breaks out in anxiety—realistic anxiety regarding the external world, moral anxiety regarding the super-ego, and neurotic anxiety regarding the strength of the passions in the id."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). pp. 110–11.&lt;/ref&gt; It has to do its best to suit all three, thus is constantly feeling hemmed by the danger of causing discontent on two other sides. It is said, however, that the ego seems to be more loyal to the id, preferring to gloss over the finer details of reality to minimize conflicts while pretending to have a regard for reality. But the super-ego is constantly watching every one of the ego's moves and punishes it with feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], and inferiority.

To overcome this the ego employs [[defense mechanism]]s. The defense mechanisms are not done so directly or consciously. They lessen the tension by covering up our impulses that are threatening.&lt;ref name="Meyers"&gt;{{cite book |last=Meyers |first=David G. |authorlink=David Myers (academic) |title=Psychology Eighth Edition in Modules |publisher=Worth Publishers |year=2007 |chapter=Module 44 The Psychoanalytic Perspective |isbn=978-0-7167-7927-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ego defense mechanisms are often used by the ego when id behavior conflicts with reality and either society's morals, norms, and taboos or the individual's expectations as a result of the internalization of these morals, norms, and their taboos.

However, his daughter [[Anna Freud]] clarified and identified the concepts of [[Undoing (psychology)|undoing]], [[Thought suppression|suppression]], [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], [[Idealization and devaluation|idealization]], [[Identification (psychology)|identification]], [[introjection]], inversion, [[somatisation]], [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]], and substitution.

[[File:Structural-Model1.png|thumb|right|200px|"The ego is not sharply separated from the id; its lower portion merges into it.... But the repressed merges into the id as well, and is merely a part of it. The repressed is only cut off sharply from the ego by the resistances of repression; it can communicate with the ego through the id." ([[Sigmund Freud]], 1923)]]In a diagram of the [[Defense mechanism#Structural model: The id, ego, and superego|Structural and Topographical Models of Mind]], the ego is depicted to be half in the consciousness, while a quarter is in the [[preconscious]] and the other quarter lies in the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]].

{{quote|Thus a child's super-ego is in fact constructed on the model not of its parents but of its parents' super-ego; the contents which fill it are the same and it becomes the vehicle of tradition and of all the time-resisting judgments of value which have propagated themselves in this manner from generation to generation.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). pp. 95-6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The super-ego aims for perfection.&lt;ref name="Meyers"/&gt; It forms the organized part of the personality structure, mainly but not entirely unconscious, that includes the individual's [[ego ideals]], spiritual goals, and the psychic agency (commonly called "conscience") that criticizes and prohibits their drives, fantasies, feelings, and actions. "The Super-ego can be thought of as a type of conscience that punishes misbehavior with feelings of guilt. For example, for having extra-marital affairs."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur S. Reber, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Psychology'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Taken in this sense, the super-ego is the precedent for the conceptualization of the [[inner critic]] as it appears in contemporary therapies such as [[Internal Family Systems Model|IFS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=Richard|title=Internal Family Systems Therapy|date=1997|publisher=The Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The super-ego works in contradiction to the id. The super-ego strives to act in a socially appropriate manner, whereas the id just wants instant self-gratification. The super-ego controls our sense of right and wrong and guilt. It helps us fit into society by getting us to act in socially acceptable ways.&lt;ref name="Snowden"/&gt;

The super-ego's demands often oppose the id's, so the ego sometimes has a hard time in reconciling the two.&lt;ref name="Meyers"/&gt;

Freud's theory implies that the super-ego is a symbolic internalisation of the [[father figure]] and cultural regulations. The super-ego tends to stand in opposition to the desires of the id because of their conflicting objectives, and its aggressiveness towards the ego. The super-ego acts as the [[conscience]], maintaining our sense of morality and proscription from taboos. The super-ego and the ego are the product of two key factors: the state of helplessness of the child and the [[Oedipus complex]].&lt;ref name="Sédat"&gt;{{cite journal

Freud described the super-ego and its relationship to the father figure and Oedipus complex thus:
{{quote|The super-ego retains the character of the father, while the more powerful the Oedipus complex was and the more rapidly it succumbed to repression (under the influence of authority, religious teaching, schooling and reading), the stricter will be the domination of the super-ego over the ego later on—in the form of conscience or perhaps of an unconscious sense of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''[[The Ego and the Id]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The concept of super-ego and the Oedipus complex is subject to criticism for its perceived sexism. Women, who are considered to be already castrated, do not identify with the father, and therefore, for Freud, "their super-ego is never so inexorable, so impersonal, so independent of its emotional origins as we require it to be in men...they are often more influenced in their judgements by feelings of affection or hostility."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (Penguin Freud Library 7) p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Freud went on to modify his position to the effect "that the majority of men are also far behind the masculine ideal and that all human individuals, as a result of their human identity, combine in themselves both masculine and feminine characteristics, otherwise known as human characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Sexuality'' p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages of the structural model ==

[[File:Structural-Iceberg.svg|thumb|280px|The [[iceberg]] metaphor is often used to explain the psyche's parts in relation to one another.]]

Freud's earlier, topographical model of the mind had divided the mind into the three elements of conscious, [[preconscious]], and unconscious. The conscious contains events that we are aware of, preconscious is events that are in the process of becoming conscious, and unconscious include events that we are not aware of.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;{{cite book |last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology, the science of behaviour: The psychodynamic approach|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada |location=Toronto |isbn=978-0-205-64524-4 |page=453}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its heart was "the dialectic of unconscious traumatic memory versus consciousness...which soon became a conflict between System Ucs versus System Cs."&lt;ref&gt;James S. Grotstein, in Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 2003) p. x&lt;/ref&gt; With what Freud called the "disagreeable discovery that on the one hand (super-)ego and conscious and on the other hand repressed and unconscious are far from coinciding,"&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud took the step in the structural model to "no longer use the term 'unconscious' in the systematic sense," and to rename "the mental region that is foreign to the ego...[and] in future call it the 'id'."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The partition of the psyche defined in the structural model is thus one that cuts across the topographical model's partition of "conscious vs. unconscious".

"The new terminology which he introduced has a highly clarifying effect and so made further clinical advances possible."&lt;ref&gt;Angela Richards "Editor's Introduction" Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' pp. 344–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Its value lies in the increased degree of precision and diversification made possible: Although the id is unconscious by definition, the ego and the super-ego are both partly conscious and partly unconscious. What is more, with this new model Freud achieved a more systematic classification of mental disorder than had been available previously:

{{quote|[[Transference neurosis|Transference neuroses]] correspond to a conflict between the ego and the id; [[narcissistic neurosis|narcissistic neuroses]], to a conflict between the ego and the superego; and [[psychosis|psychoses]], to one between the ego and the external world.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''[[Neurosis and Psychosis]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is important to realise however, that "the three newly presented entities, the id, the ego and the superego, all had lengthy past histories (two of them under other names)"&lt;ref&gt;Angela Richards, "Editor's Introduction" in ''On Metapsychology'' p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;—the id as the systematic unconscious, the super-ego as conscience/ego ideal. Equally, Freud never abandoned the topographical division of conscious, preconscious, and unconscious, though as he noted ruefully "the three qualities of consciousness and the three provinces of the mental apparatus do not fall together into three peaceful couples...we had no right to expect any such smooth arrangement."&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud (1933). pp. 104–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The iceberg metaphor is a commonly used visual metaphor when attempting to relate the ego, id and superego with the conscious and unconscious mind. In the iceberg metaphor the entire id and part of both the superego and the ego would be submerged in the underwater portion representing the unconscious mind. The remaining portions of the ego and superego would be displayed above water in the conscious mind area.&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt;

== Translation ==

The terms "id", "ego", and "super-ego" are not Freud's own. They are latinisations by his translator [[James Strachey]]. Freud himself wrote of "''[[wikt:das#German|das]] [[wikt:Es#German|Es]]''",&lt;ref name="Es"/&gt; "''das [[wikt:Ich|Ich]]''",&lt;ref name="Ich"/&gt; and "''das [[wikt:über-|Über-]]Ich''"&lt;ref name="Über-Ich"/&gt;—respectively, "the It", "the I", and "the Over-I" (or "I above"); thus to the German reader, Freud's original terms are more or less self-explanatory. Freud borrowed the term "''das Es''" from [[Georg Groddeck]], a German physician to whose unconventional ideas Freud was much attracted (Groddeck's translators render the term in English as "the It").&lt;ref name="Groddeck"&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite book |last=Groddeck |first=Georg |authorlink=Georg Groddeck |title=Das Buch vom Es. Psychoanalytische Briefe an eine Freundin |trans-title=[https://archive.org/details/b29815101 The Book of the It] |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lpYXAAAAYAAJ |publisher=Internationaler Psychoanalytischer Verlag |location=[[Vienna]] |year=1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''[[wikt:ego|ego]]'' is taken directly from [[Latin]], where it is the [[nominative]] of the first person singular [[personal pronoun]] and is translated as "I myself" to express emphasis.
Figures like [[Bruno Bettelheim]] have criticized the way "the English translations impeded students' efforts to gain a true understanding of Freud."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 1996) p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; by substituting the formalised language of the [[Basil Bernstein|elaborated code]] for the quotidian immediacy of Freud's own language.

Keyes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0160-7383(84)90026-4 | volume=11 | issue=3 | title=Introduction tourism and re-created ethnicity | journal=Annals of Tourism Research | pages=343–352| year=1984 | last1=Van Den Berghe | first1=Pierre L. | last2=Keyes | first2=Charles F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This volume examines the ways in which tourism intersects with the (re-)formation and revision of various forms of identity, particularly ethnic and cultural identities. Since that time, various scholars have examined the intersection between dimensions of identity and tourism. An important early contribution to the study of identity tourism was Lanfant, Allcock and Bruner's 1995 edited volume "International Tourism, Identity and Change".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uk.sagepub.com/books/Book204567/title "International Tourism, Identity and Change"]. Retrieved on February 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As with the Keyes and van den Berghe special issue of Annals of Tourism Research, this volume moved us away from studying the impact of tourism on identity to investigating the intersection of tourism and identity in more dynamic ways, among other things looking at how "local" and "tourist" identities are mutually-constructed. Likewise, Michel Picard and Robert Wood's path-breaking edited volume "Tourism, Ethnicity and the State in Asian and Pacific Societies" (1997, University of Hawaii Press), examined the ways in which tourism intersections with ethnic, cultural, regional and national identities, as well as with the political agendas of Pacific island and Southeast Asian states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-422-9780824819118.aspx "Tourism, Ethnicity, and the State in Asian and Pacific Societies"].

Among other things the chapters in their volume investigated tourists' views of themselves and others in the course of their travels, the relationship of travelers to resident populations, and the ways in which tourists' quests for authenticity are entangled with their own sensibilities about their own identities.

Various case studies of tourism and identity merit mention here. Edward Bruner's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://anthro.illinois.edu/directory/profile/ebruner|title=Edward M Bruner - Anthropology at Illinois|website=anthro.illinois.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2001 article "The Masai and the Lion King: Authenticity, Nationalism and Globalization in African Tourism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|accessdate=February 18, 2014|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/ae.2001.28.4.881/abstract|doi=10.1525/ae.2001.28.4.881|title=The Maasai and the Lion King: Authenticity, Nationalism, and Globalization in African Tourism|journal=American Ethnologist|volume=28|issue=4|pages=881|author=Edward M. Bruner|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a penetrating examination of how various Kenyan tourist sites entail displays of particular identities ("Masai" "Colonialist" etc.) and how tourists' engagements with these identity displays are varied, nuanced and complex, articulating with their own narratives, sensibilities about African heritage and quests. [[Kathleen M. Adams]]' 2006 work on tourism, identity and the arts in Toraja, Indonesia illustrates how tourism is drawn upon by different members of the community to elaborate different dimensions of identity. In "Art as Politics: Re-crafting tourism, identities and power in Tana Toraja, Indonesia",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-9780824830724.aspx "Art as Politics: Re-crafting tourism, identities and power in Tana Toraja, Indonesia"]. Retrieved on February 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Adams documents how tourism challenges older elite identities in the community, reconfiguring artistic and ritual symbols once associated with elites as broader symbols of Toraja ethnic group identity.

== Cyberspace ==
The emergence of the internet as a venue of identity expression is also relevant to the theme of tourism and identity. A 2011 edited volume on [http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-4431-9780824830724.aspx Tourism Social Media: Transformations in Identity, Community and Culture] by hospitality and business school scholars spotlights some of these issues, as    Moreover, there are various programs and applications, such as chat rooms, forums, MUDs, MOOs, MMORPGs, and others in which a user is allowed to establish an identity in that particular space. This online identity could be different from a user's physical identity in race, gender, height, weight or even species. In chat rooms and forums, a user creates their identity through text and the way they interact with others. In MMORPGs, users create a visual representation of their identity, an avatar. This allows users to easily tour more than just ethnic and cultural identities.

With the development of the internet and virtual reality, identity tourism can become more salient than previously thought. With virtual reality, for example, those who identify as transgender could create that identity in an MMORPG or forum.  [[Lisa Nakamura]]&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, L. (2000). [http://www.humanities.uci.edu/mposter/syllabi/readings/nakamura.html ''Race In/For Cyberspace: Identity Tourism and Racial Passing on the Internet.''] Retrieved on October 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; has studied identity tourism in cyberspace, using it to describe the process of appropriating an identity involving another gender and/or race than one's own on the web. She describes the process as an avenue through which cultural, ethnic, and racial differences are commodified, stereotyped, and neglected. This kind of cyber-identity tourism mainly refers to the web but also touch other media forms, such as [[video games]].&lt;ref&gt;Flew, T. and Humphreys, S. (2005). "Games: Technology, Industry, Culture." ''New Media: An Introduction'', Oxford University Press, South Melbourne 101–114.&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to 'tour' the internet with a new identity opens the possibility of the net being an identifiable space.

[[File:Imagination-Warner-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[Olin Levi Warner]], ''Imagination'' (1896). Library of Congress [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]
'''Imagination''' is the ability to produce images, [[idea]]s and sensations in the [[mind]] without any immediate input of the [[senses]] (such as seeing or hearing). Imagination helps make knowledge applicable in solving problems and is fundamental to integrating experience and the [[learning process]].&lt;ref name="Norman2000"&gt;Norman 2000 pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sutton-Smith88"&gt;[[Brian Sutton-Smith]] 1988, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Archibald MacLeish]] 1970, p. 887&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Egan92"&gt;[[Kieran Egan (educationist)|Kieran Egan]] 1992, pp. 50&lt;/ref&gt; A basic training for imagination is listening to [[storytelling]] ([[narrative]]),&lt;ref name="Norman2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]] 1963, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; in which the exactness of the chosen words is the fundamental factor to "evoke worlds".&lt;ref&gt;As noted by [[Giovanni Pascoli]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Imagination is a [[cognitive process]] used in mental functioning and sometimes used in conjunction with [[psychology|psychological]] [[imagery]]. The cognate term of mental imagery may be used in [[psychology]] for denoting the process of reviving in the mind recollections of objects formerly given in sense perception. Since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary [[language]], some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as "[[wikt:imaging|imaging]]" or "[[wikt:imagery|imagery]]" or to speak of it as "reproductive" as opposed to "productive" or "constructive" imagination. Constructive imagination is further divided into voluntary top-down imagination driven by the [[prefrontal cortex]], that is called [[mental synthesis]], and spontaneous bottom up involuntary generation of novel images that occurs during dreaming. Imagined images, both novel and recalled, are seen with the "[[mind's eye]]".

Imagination can also be expressed through stories such as [[fairy tale]]s or [[Fantasy|fantasies]].  Children often use such [[narrative]]s and pretend play in order to exercise their imaginations. When children develop fantasy they play at two levels: first, they use [[role playing]] to act out what they have developed with their imagination, and at the second level they play again with their make-believe situation by acting as if what they have developed is an actual reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Laurence Goldman |title=Child's play: myth, mimesis and make-believe. |quote=Basically what this means is that the children use their make-believe situation and act as if what they are acting out is from a reality that already exists even though they have made it up.imagination comes after story created.|location=Oxford New York|isbn=1-85973-918-0  |publisher=Berg Publishers |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The mind's eye==
The notion of a "mind's eye" goes back at least to [[Cicero]]'s reference to '''''mentis oculi''''' during his discussion of the orator's appropriate use of [[simile]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=XCU9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA535#v=onepage Cicero, ''De Oratore'', Liber III: XLI: 163.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this discussion, Cicero observed that allusions to "the [[Gulf of Gabès|Syrtis]] of his patrimony" and "the [[Charybdis]] of his possessions" involved similes that were "too far-fetched"; and he advised the orator to, instead, just speak of "the rock" and "the gulf" (respectively) — on the grounds that "the eyes of the mind are more easily directed to those objects which we have seen, than to those which we have only heard".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ciceroonoratorya00ciceuoft#page/239/mode/1upWatson, J.S. (trans. and ed.), ''Cicero on Oratory and Orators'', Harper &amp; Brothers, (New York), 1875:  Book III, C.XLI, p.239.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "the mind's eye" first appeared in English in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] (c.1387) [[The Man of Law's Prologue and Tale|Man of Law's Tale]] in his [[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]], where he tells us that one of the three men dwelling in a castle was blind, and could only see with "the eyes of his mind"; namely, those eyes "with which all men see after they have become blind".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/canterburyprol00chauuoft#page/78/mode/1up ''The Man of Laws Tale'', lines 550-553.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The common use of the term is for the process of forming new images in the mind that have not been previously experienced with the help of what has been seen, heard, or felt before, or at least only partially or in different combinations. Some typical examples follow:
* [[Fairy tale]]
* [[Fiction]]
* A form of [[verisimilitude]] often invoked in [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]] invites readers to pretend such stories are true by referring to [[object of the mind|objects of the mind]] such as fictional books or years that do not exist apart from an [[imaginary world]].

Imagination, not being limited to the acquisition of exact knowledge by the requirements of practical necessity is largely free from objective restraints. The ability to imagine one's self in another person's place is very important to social relations and understanding. [[Albert Einstein]] said, "Imagination ... is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=What life means to Einstein: an interview | date=October 26, 1929 | last=Viereck | first=George Sylvester | journal=The Saturday Evening Post | authorlink=George Sylvester Viereck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same limitations beset imagination in the field of [[scientific method|scientific]] [[hypothesis]]. Progress in scientific research is due largely to provisional explanations which are developed by imagination, but such hypotheses must be framed in relation to previously ascertained facts and in accordance with the principles of the particular science.

Imagination is an experimental partition of the mind used to develop theories and ideas based on functions. Taking objects from real perceptions, the imagination uses complex IF-functions{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} to develop new or revised ideas. This part of the mind is vital to developing better and easier ways to accomplish old and new tasks. In sociology, Imagination is used to part ways with reality and have an understanding of social interactions derived from a perspective outside of society itself. This leads to the development of theories through questions that wouldn't usually be asked. These experimental ideas can be safely conducted inside a virtual world and then, if the idea is probable and the function is true, the idea can be actualized in reality. Imagination is the key to new development of the mind and can be shared with others, progressing collectively.

Regarding the volunteer effort, imagination can be classified as:
* involuntary (the dream from the sleep, the daydream)
* voluntary (the reproductive imagination, the creative imagination, the dream of perspective)

==Psychology==
Psychologists have studied imaginative thought, not only in its exotic form of [[creativity]] and artistic expression but also in its mundane form of everyday imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, T.B., Smith, S.M, &amp; Vaid, J. (1997). Creative thought. Washington DC: APA&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruth M.J. Byrne]] has proposed that everyday imaginative thoughts about [[counterfactual thinking|counterfactual]] alternatives to reality may be based on the same cognitive processes on which rational thoughts are also based.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R.M.J. (2005). The Rational Imagination: How People Create Alternatives to Reality. Cambridge, MA: [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Children can engage in the creation of imaginative alternatives to reality from their very early years.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, P. (2000). The work of the imagination. London: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural psychology]] is currently elaborating a view of imagination as a higher mental function involved in a number of everyday activities, both at the individual and collective level&lt;ref&gt;Tateo, L. (2015). Giambattista Vico and the psychological imagination. Culture and Psychology, vol. 21(2):145-161.&lt;/ref&gt; that enables people to manipulate complex meanings of both linguistic and iconic forms in the process of experiencing.

The phenomenology of imagination is discussed In ''The Imaginary: A Phenomenological Psychology of the Imagination'' ({{lang-fr|L'Imaginaire: Psychologie phénoménologique de l'imagination}}), also published under the title ''The Psychology of the Imagination''''',''' is a 1940 book by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], in which he propounds his concept of the imagination and discusses what the existence of imagination shows about the nature of human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34102867|title=The psychology of imagination|last=1905-1980.|first=Sartre, Jean-Paul,|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415119542|location=London|oclc=34102867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The imagination is also active in our perception of photographic images in order to make them appear real.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=John G.|date=2016-12-01|title=Sartre and the Imagination: Top Shelf Magazines|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-016-9358-x|journal=Sexuality &amp; Culture|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=775–784|doi=10.1007/s12119-016-9358-x|issn=1095-5143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memory==
{{see also|Mental image|Imagery}}
Memory and mental imagery, often seen as a part of the process of imagination, have been shown to be affected by one another.&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;{{Cite book 
|author=Long, Priscilla |title=My Brain On My Mind |page=27 |date=2011 |isbn=1612301363}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Images made by functional magnetic resonance imaging technology show that remembering and imagining sends blood to identical parts of the brain."&lt;ref name="Long" /&gt; Various psychological factors can influence the mental processing of and can heighten the chance of the brain to retain information as either long-term memories or short-term memories. John Sweller indicated that experiences stored as long-term memories are easier to recall, as they are ingrained deeper in the mind. Each of these forms require information to be taught in a specific manner so as to use various regions of the brain when being processed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leahy|first=Wayne|author2=John Sweller|title=The Imagination Effect Increases with an Increased Intrinsic Cognitive Load|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|date=5 June 2007|volume=22|pages=275|doi=10.1002/acp.1373}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information can potentially help develop programs for young students to cultivate or further enhance their creative abilities from a young age. The [[neocortex]] and [[thalamus]] are responsible for controlling the brain's imagination, along with many of the brain's other functions such as consciousness and abstract thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainhealthandpuzzles.com/brain_parts_function.html|title=Welcome to Brain Health and Puzzles!| accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since imagination involves many different brain functions, such as emotions, memory, thoughts, etc., portions of the brain where multiple functions occur—such as the thalamus and neocortex—are the main regions where imaginative processing has been documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceforums.net/topic/33986-what-part-of-the-brain-handles-imagination-answered/ |title=Welcome to ScienceForums.Net!}}&lt;/ref&gt; The understanding of ''how'' memory and imagination are linked in the brain, paves the way to better understand one's ability to link significant past experiences with their imagination.

==Perception==
[[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] posited that [[perception]]s depend on the world view of a person. The world view is the result of arranging perceptions into existing imagery by imagination. Piaget cites the example of a child saying that the moon is following her when she walks around the village at night. Like this, perceptions are integrated into the world view to make sense. Imagination is needed to make sense of perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. (1967). The child's conception of the world. (J. &amp; A. Tomlinson, Trans.). London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul. BF721 .P5 1967X&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versus belief==
Imagination is different from [[belief]] because the subject understands that what is personally invented by the mind does not necessarily affect the course of action taken in the apparently shared world, while beliefs are part of what one holds as truths about both the shared and personal worlds. The play of imagination, apart from the obvious limitations (e.g. of avoiding explicit self-contradiction), is conditioned only by the general trend of the mind at a given moment. Belief, on the other hand, is immediately related to practical activity: it is perfectly possible to imagine oneself a millionaire, but unless one believes it one does not, therefore, act as such. Belief endeavors to conform to the subject's experienced conditions or faith in the possibility of those conditions; whereas imagination as such is specifically free. The dividing line between imagination and belief varies widely in different stages of technological development. Thus in more extreme cases, someone from a primitive culture  who ill frames an ideal reconstruction of the causes of his illness, and attributes it to the hostile magic of an enemy based on faith and tradition rather than science. In ignorance of the science of pathology the subject is satisfied with this explanation, and actually believes in it, sometimes to the point of death, due to what is known as the [[nocebo]] effect. It follows that the learned distinction between imagination and belief depends in practice on religion, tradition, and culture.{{according to whom|date=September 2017}}

==Brain activation==
A study using [[fMRI]] while subjects were asked to imagine precise visual figures, to mentally disassemble them, or mentally blend them, showed activity in the [[occipital lobe|occipital]],  frontoparietal, [[posterior parietal]], [[precuneus]], and [[dorsolateral prefrontal]] regions of the subject's brains.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Schlegel, Peter J. Kohler, Sergey V. Fogelson, Prescott Alexander, Dedeepya Konuthula, and Peter Ulric Tse (Sep 16, 2013) [http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/09/13/1311149110 Network structure and dynamics of the mental workspace] ''PNAS'' early edition&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a reality==
The world as experienced is an interpretation of data arriving from the senses; as such, it is perceived as real by contrast to most thoughts and imaginings. Users of hallucinogenic drugs are said to have a heightened imagination. This difference is only one of degree and can be altered by several historic causes, namely changes to brain chemistry, [[hypnosis]] or other [[Altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]], [[meditation]], many hallucinogenic drugs, and electricity applied directly to specific parts of the brain. The difference between imagined and perceived reality can be proven by [[psychosis]]. Many mental illnesses can be attributed to this inability to distinguish between the sensed and the internally created worlds. Some cultures and traditions even view the apparently shared world as an illusion of the mind as with the [[Buddhist]] maya, or go to the opposite extreme and accept the imagined and dreamed realms as of equal validity to the apparently shared world as the [[Australian Aborigines]] do with their concept of [[dreamtime]].

Imagination, because of having freedom from external limitations, can often become a source of real [[pleasure]] and unnecessary [[suffering]]. Consistent with this idea, imagining pleasurable and fearful events is found to engage emotional circuits involved in emotional perception and experience.&lt;ref name=Costa&gt;{{cite journal |author=Costa, VD, Lang, PJ, Sabatinelli, D, Bradley MM, and Versace, F |title=Emotional imagery: Assessing pleasure and arousal in the brain's reward circuitry |journal=Human Brain Mapping |volume=31 |pages=1446–1457 |year=2010 |doi=10.1002/hbm.20948 |pmid=20127869 |issue=9 |pmc=3620013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person of vivid imagination often suffers acutely from the imagined perils besetting friends, relatives, or even strangers such as celebrities. Also crippling [[fear]] can result from taking an imagined painful future too seriously.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="857">In the [[Mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[category theory]], specifically the theory of [[2-category|2-categories]], a lax natural transformation is a kind of morphism between [[2-functors]]. 

==Definition==
Let ''C'' and ''D'' be 2-categories, and let &lt;math&gt;F,G\colon C\to D&lt;/math&gt; be 2-functors. A lax natural transformation &lt;math&gt;\alpha\colon F\to G&lt;/math&gt; between them consists of
* a morphism &lt;math&gt;\alpha_c\colon F(c)\to G(c)&lt;/math&gt; in ''D'' for every object &lt;math&gt;c\in C&lt;/math&gt; and 
* a 2-morphism &lt;math&gt;\alpha_f\colon G(f)\circ\alpha_c \to \alpha_{c'}\circ F(f)&lt;/math&gt; for every morphism &lt;math&gt;f\colon c\to c'&lt;/math&gt; in ''C''
satisfying some equations (see &lt;ref&gt;nLab page (http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/lax+natural+transformation)&lt;/ref&gt; or &lt;ref&gt;Gray, Adjointness For 2-Categories&lt;/ref&gt;)

Nelson was arrested several times on unrelated charges over the following years.  In a third trial for Rosenbaum's murder, Nelson was convicted of violating Rosenbaum's [[civil rights]] in the murder, and served a 10-year sentence. Nelson admitted for the first time at his 2003 trial that he had stabbed Rosenbaum.

His mother, who reportedly suffered from mental illness, repeatedly tried to [[Abortion|abort]] him before he was born. As an infant, he lived with his mother at a shelter for battered women.

==Killing of Yankel Rosenbaum==

Rosenbaum died from internal bleeding at Kings County Hospital. His medical treatment at the hospital was the subject of later litigation: doctors failed to notice one of Rosenbaum's four stab wounds for almost an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman |first=Andy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/17/nyregion/juror-explains-mixed-verdict-on-crown-hts.html|title=Juror Explains Mixed Verdict On Crown Hts |location=|newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 17, 2003 |accessdate=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murder trial (1992)===
Nelson was tried on charges of murder as a hate crime in a New York state court in 1992. Nelson pleaded not guilty to the charge and denied stabbing Rosenbaum.&lt;ref name="nytimes2003"&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman |first=Andy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/15/nyregion/the-crown-heights-verdict-overview-mixed-verdict-on-crown-hts-defense-happy.html?ref=lemrick_jr_nelson |title=The Crown Heights Verdict – Overview – Mixed Verdict On Crown Hts. – Defense Happy |location=|newspaper=The New York Times |date=May 15, 2003 |accessdate=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police testified that Nelson had confessed to murdering Rosenbaum to police officers.&lt;ref name="nytimesOct1992"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/31/opinion/the-crown-heights-acquittal.html?ref=lemrick_jr_nelson |title=The Crown Heights Acquittal |location=New York City; Crown Heights (Nyc) |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 31, 1992 |accessdate=October 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors claimed Nelson had been carrying a blood-stained knife inscribed with the word "KilleR" at the time he was arrested, but Nelson's defense denied the knife was his and suggested police officers had found it elsewhere. No evidence of fingerprints on the knife was presented.&lt;ref name="nytimesOct1992"/&gt; Despite media reports that the pants Nelson had been wearing at the time of his arrest had been bloody,&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Books.google.com"/&gt; prosecutors did not present evidence of bloodstains upon Nelson's clothing.&lt;ref name="nytimesOct1992"/&gt;

Nelson was acquitted of murder on October 29, 1992.&lt;ref name="nytimesOct1992"/&gt; The racial composition of the jury (which was considered relevant in the context of the racially charged atmosphere) is unclear: some contemporary reports described the jury as having consisted of six black jurors, four Hispanic jurors and two white jurors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/47165/ |title='The New Anti-Semitism' |date=January 11, 1993 |work=New York Magazine |accessdate=October 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later reports described the jury as having consisted of eight black jurors, two white jurors and two Guyanese Americans of undisclosed race&lt;ref name="nytimes2003"/&gt; or as being "predominantly black".&lt;ref name="DF-ZMgBPEVMC 2010, p. 50"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DF-ZMgBPEVMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+American+Criminal+Justice+System:+How+It+Works,+How+It+Doesn't,+and+How+to+Fix+It&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MDBPTMK9A4P78AaGx53ZDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Gerhard Falk, ''The American Criminal Justice System: How It Works, How It Doesn't, and How to Fix It''], ABC-CLIO, 2010, p. 50. Retrieved July 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed that after conclusion of the trial, some jurors attended a party hosted by Nelson's lawyer which honored Nelson as a "hero."&lt;ref name="DF-ZMgBPEVMC 2010, p. 50"/&gt;

===Violation of civil rights trials (1997 and 2003)===

In 1997, Nelson was convicted in federal court of violating Rosenbaum's civil rights. However, that verdict was vacated on appeal due to unfairness in the jury selection process.&lt;ref name="nytimes2003"/&gt;

A retrial was held in 2003. There were two primary issues of contention: whether Nelson's actions had been motivated by prejudice and whether Nelson's actions caused Rosenbaum's death.

In a departure from his position in the 1992 trial, Nelson admitted to having stabbed Rosenbaum and apologized to Rosenbaum's family for his actions.&lt;ref name="Gourevitch"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Philip |last=Gourevitch |journal=The Jewish Forward |date=January 1993 |url=http://www.ex-iwp.org/docs/1993/Crown+Heights+Riot+Aftermath.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205030339/http://ex-iwp.org/docs/1993/Crown%2BHeights%2BRiot%2BAftermath.htm/ |archivedate=December  5, 2013 |title=The Crown Heights Riot &amp; Its Aftermath |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9805EFDB1F30F932A1575BC0A9659C8B63|title=Penalty in Crown Hts.

On the issue of whether Nelson caused Rosenbaum's death, medical evidence was presented indicating that Rosenbaum had been stabbed four times, of which two of the wounds were fatal.&lt;ref name="pqasb.pqarchiver.com"&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nypost/access/337008331.html?dids=337008331:337008331&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+15%2C+2003&amp;author=KATI+CORNELL+SMITH&amp;pub=New+York+Post&amp;desc=LEMRICK+GUILTY+-+BUT+HE+FACES+ONLY+2+YEARS+IN+JAIL&amp;pqatl=google "Lemrick Guilty – but he faces only 2 years in jail"], by Kati Cornell Smith, ''[[New York Post]]'', May 15, 2003. Retrieved July 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2003, the jury found Nelson guilty of violating Rosenbaum's civil rights, but he was not found to have caused Rosenbaum's death.&lt;ref name="pqasb.pqarchiver.com"/&gt; According to [[Cornell University Law School|Cornell]] law professor Sherry Colb, the jury's verdict was "logically incoherent." Rosenbaum's family had filed a malpractice suit against the hospital where he died.  The jury was supposed to—but did not—ignore this information in determining Nelson's guilt, reasoning that the hospital and Nelson could not both be guilty. Colb writes that "this line of reasoning can most generously be described as misguided and less generously as stupid."&lt;ref&gt;Sherry F. Colb, [http://writ.news.findlaw.com/colb/20030604.html ''The Verdict in the Lemrick Nelson Trial: Jury Deliberations Expose a Troubling Reality''], June 4, 2003, in FindLaw.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson was subsequently sentenced to the maximum sentence of ten years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; He served the full sentence (including time served before his 2003 trial) and was released on June 2, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2004/06/03/2004-06-03_lemrick_nelson_s_out_of_jail.html|author=John Marzulli and Dave Godiner|title=Lemrick Nelson's Out of Jail |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |date=June 3, 2004 |accessdate=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a May 2010 interview with the ''[[New York Post]]'', Nelson indicated that he had stopped drinking; he said he considered stabbing Rosenbaum a "mistake" he made as "a kid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldstein |first=Joseph |url=http://www.nypost.com/f/news/local/brooklyn/crown_hts_thug_new_life_RRn9y1S44iYOFPMgRUt3zI |title=Crown Heights riot figure Lemrick Nelson lives quietly in Hillside, New Jersey |newspaper=New York Post |date=May 16, 2010 |accessdate=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and social reaction===
According to ''[[New York Magazine]]'', Nelson's initial acquittal fueled anger at Mayor [[David Dinkins]], with Dinkins becoming "a surrogate for Lemrick Nelson", in part because of Dinkins's support for the verdict, saying "I have no doubt that in this case the criminal-justice system has operated fairly and openly."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o-QCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=The+Politics+of+grievance:+Dinkins,+the+Blacks,+and+the+Jews,&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jU7UsUaRHT&amp;sig=v27SvnpDJadVdmmA6yep6ZfL8c0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RQivTNf_H4H48Ab38pWfCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=surrogate&amp;f=false "The Politics of grievance: Dinkins, the Blacks, and the Jews"], ''New York Magazine'', December 7, 1992, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Edward Shapiro, professor of history at [[Seton Hall University]], "it is possible that David Dinkins would have been re-elected mayor in 1993 had the jury not exonerated Lemrick Nelson on October 29, 1992." Shapiro has called the riot "the most serious anti-Semitic incident in American history".&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=StQXz-ClGuUC |accessdate=October 20, 2007 |last=Shapiro |first=Edward S. |year=2006 |title=Crown heights: Blacks, Jews, and the 1991 Brooklyn riot |location=[[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]], [[Massachusetts]] |publisher=[[Brandeis University]] Press, [[University Press of New England]]|page=xi|isbn=1-58465-561-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other incidents==

After being acquitted of Rosenbaum's murder in 1992, Nelson moved to a suburb of [[Atlanta, Georgia]], to live with a half-sister.&lt;ref name="nytimes1995"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fried |first=Joseph P. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/07/nyregion/guilty-plea-by-suspect-in-slashing.html |title=Guilty Plea By Suspect In Slashing |location=Dekalb County (Ga); Crown Heights (Nyc) |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 7, 1995 |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fried |first=Joseph P. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/28/nyregion/friend-of-crown-heights-suspect-says-he-confessed.html |title=Friend of Crown Heights Suspect Says He Confessed |location= |newspaper=New York Times|date=January 28, 1997 |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="findlaw1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1287462.html |title=U.S. v.

===Aggravated assault and weapon charges (1994)===
Nelson was charged in January 1994 with [[aggravated assault]] for slashing Erik Heard, a high school classmate, because Heard had reported to school officials that Nelson had stolen money from another classmate. When he was arrested on March 5, 1994, Nelson was also charged with carrying a [[concealed weapon]] (a scalpel).&lt;ref name="findacase1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="findlaw1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smothers |first=Ronald |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/23/nyregion/crown-hts-case-follows-youth-to-atlanta.html |title=Crown Hts.

===Disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, and harassment charges (1995)===
After spending approximately two years in Georgia, Nelson returned to the New York area in 1994.&lt;ref name="nytimes4"/&gt;  He lived with his mother in New Jersey, and his father in Crown Heights.&lt;ref name="nytimes4"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pierre |first=Garry |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/24/nyregion/youth-charged-in-crown-heights-incident-is-arrested-again.html |title=Youth Charged In Crown Heights Incident Is Arrested Again |location= |newspaper=New York Times|date=June 24, 1995 |accessdate=July 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson was subsequently arrested and charged with second-degree assault, [[resisting arrest]] and disorderly conduct.&lt;ref name="nytimes4"/&gt;

A warrant was issued for his arrest, which was deemed a parole violation.&lt;ref name="nytimes3"/&gt;

===Criminal trespass arrest (1996)===
Nelson was charged with criminal trespass on February 8, 1996. Police claimed that, having left a court hearing 90 minutes previously, Nelson was arrested after refusing to leave the lobby of an apartment building in which he did not live and that he was carrying a box cutter at the time.&lt;ref name="findacase1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nydailynews1996"&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith |first=Greg B. |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1996/02/09/1996-02-09_crown_heights_suspect_in_new.html |title=Crown Heights Suspect In New Brush With Law |publisher=Nydailynews.com |date=February 9, 1996 |accessdate=July 29, 2010 | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NLP argues that people act and feel based on their perception of the world and how they feel about that world they subjectively experience.

NLP teaches that language and behaviors (whether functional or dysfunctional) are highly structured, and that this structure can be 'modeled' or copied into a reproducible form.&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1979"&gt;{{cite book | author=Bandler, R., Grinder, J. | title=Frogs into Princes: Neuro Linguistic Programming | location=Moab, UT | publisher=Real People Press. | year=1979 | pages=149 (pp. 15, 24, 30, 45, 52) | isbn=0-911226-19-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}} Using NLP a person can 'model' the more successful parts of their own behavior in order to reproduce it in areas where they are less successful or 'model' another person to effect belief and behavior changes to improve functioning. If someone excels in some activity, it can be [[Modeling (NLP)|learned]] how specifically they do it by observing certain important details of their behavior.&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1975a"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bandler, Richard  |author2=John Grinder  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=The Structure of Magic I: A Book About Language and Therapy | location=Palo Alto, CA | publisher=Science &amp; Behavior Books | year=1975|isbn= 0-8314-0044-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}} NLP embodies several techniques, including hypnotic techniques, which proponents claim can affect changes in the way people think, learn and communicate.&lt;ref name="Dilts et al. 1980"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dilts, R.B., Grinder, J., Bandler, R., DeLozier, J.A. | title=Neuro-Linguistic Programming: Volume I - The Study of the Structure of Subjective Experience | publisher=Meta Publications | year=1980 | isbn=0-916990-07-9 | pages=284(pp.3–4, 6, 14,17)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}} NLP is an eclectic field, often described as a 'toolbox' which has borrowed heavily from other fields in collating its presuppositions and techniques.

==Internal 'maps' of the world==
NLP calls each individual's perception of the world their 'map'.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} NLP teaches that our mind-body{{clarify|date=September 2017}} (neuro) and what we say (language) all interact together to form our perceptions of the world, or maps (programming). Each person's map of the world determines feelings and behavior.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Therefore, impoverished – and unrealistic – maps can restrict choices and result in problems.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
As an approach to personal development or therapy it involves understanding that people create their own internal 'map' or world, recognizing unhelpful or destructive  patterns of thinking based on impoverished maps of the world, then modifying or replacing these patterns with more useful or helpful ones. There is also an emphasis on ways to change internal representations or maps of the world in order to increase behavioral flexibility.&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1979" /&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1975a" /&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1983"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bandler, Richard  |author2=John Grinder  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Reframing: Neurolinguistic programming and the transformation of meaning | location=Moab, UT | publisher=Real People Press. | year=1983 | pages=appendix II,p.171}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}

==Modeling==
"Modeling" in NLP is the process of adopting the behaviors, language, strategies and beliefs of another person or exemplar in order to 'build a model of what they do...we know that our modeling has been successful when we can systematically get the same behavioural outcome as the person we have modeled'.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The 'model' is then reduced{{by whom|date=September 2017}} to a pattern that can be taught to others. The founders, Bandler and Grinder, started by analysing in detail and then searching for what made successful [[psychotherapist]]s different from their peers. The patterns discovered were developed over time and adapted for general communication and effecting change.&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1979"/&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}} The original models were: [[Milton Erickson]] ([[hypnotherapy]]), [[Virginia Satir]] ([[family therapy]]), and [[Fritz Perls]] ([[gestalt therapy]]). NLP modeling methods are designed to unconsciously assimilate the tacit knowledge to learn what the master is doing of which the master is not aware. As an approach to learning it can involve modeling exceptional people.&lt;ref name="Jacobson 1994"&gt;Jacobson, S. (1994)  Info-line: practical guidelines for training and development professionals, ''American Society For Training and Development'' Alexandria, VA. [http://sidjacobson.com/institute/history.html Adapted version available online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610030957/http://www.sidjacobson.com/institute/history.html |date=2007-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Bandler and Grinder state "the function of NLP modeling is to arrive at descriptions which are useful."&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1979"/&gt;{{ufs|date=November 2017}} Einspruch &amp; Forman 1985 state that "when modeling another person the modeler suspends his or her own beliefs and adopts the structure of the physiology, language, strategies, and beliefs of the person being modeled. After the modeler is capable of behaviorally reproducing the patterns (of behavior, communication, and behavioral outcomes) of the one being modeled, a process occurs in which the modeler modifies and readopts his or her own belief system while also integrating the beliefs of the one who was modeled."&lt;ref name="Einspruch &amp; Forman 1985"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Einspruch, Eric L., Forman, Bruce D. | title=Observations Concerning Research Literature on Neuro-Linguistic Programming | journal=Journal of Counseling Psychology | year=1985 | volume=32 | pages=589–596 | doi=10.1037/0022-0167.32.4.589 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modeling is not confined to therapy, but can be, and is, applied to a broad range of human learning. Another aspect of modeling is understanding the patterns of one's own behaviors in order to 'model' the more successful parts of oneself.

==Milton model==

The '''Milton model''' is a form of hypnotherapy based on the language patterns for hypnotic communication of [[Milton Erickson]], a noted hypnotherapist.&lt;ref name="Barretta 2004"&gt;Norma Barretta (2004) Review of Hypnotic Language: Its Structure and Use. American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis. Bloomingdale: Jan 2004. Vol.46, Iss. 3;  pg. 261, 2 pgs&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "a way of using language to induce and maintain trance in order to contact the hidden resources of our personality".&lt;ref name="OConnor &amp; Seymour 2002"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Joseph O'Connor | author2=John Seymour | title=Introducing NLP | location=London | publisher=HarperCollins | year=2002 | origyear=1990 | url=http://www.reiters.com/index.cgi?ISBN=1855383446&amp;f=p | isbn=1-85538-344-6 | access-date=2007-04-30 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008050248/http://www.reiters.com/index.cgi?ISBN=1855383446&amp;f=p | archive-date=2007-10-08 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Milton model has three primary aspects: Firstly, to assist in building and maintaining rapport with the client. Secondly, to overload and distract the conscious mind so that [[unconscious communication]] can be cultivated. Thirdly, to allow for interpretation in the words offered to the client.&lt;ref name="Pruett 2002"&gt;Pruett, Julie Annette Sikes (2002) The application of the neuro-linguistic programming model to vocal performance training D.M.A., The University of Texas at Austin, 151 pages; AAT 3108499&lt;/ref&gt;

;1. Rapport

The first aspect, building '''rapport''', or empathy, is done to achieve better communication and responsiveness. NLP teaches 'mirroring' or matching body language, posture, breathing, predicates and voice tonality. Rapport is an aspect of 'pacing' or tuning into the client or learners world. Once pacing is established, the practitioner can 'lead' by changing their behavior or perception so the other follows. O'Connor &amp; Seymour in "Introducing NLP" describe rapport as a 'harmonious dance', an extension of natural skills, but warn against mimicry.&lt;ref name="OConnor &amp; Seymour 2002"/&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}} Singer gives examples of the pantomime effect of mere mimicry by some practitioners which does not create rapport.&lt;ref name="Singer &amp; Lalich 1997"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Singer, Margaret  |author2=Janja Lalich  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Crazy Therapies: What Are They? Do They Work? | publisher=Jossey Bass | year=1997 | isbn=0-7879-0278-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}

;2. Overloading conscious attention

The second aspect of the Milton model is that it uses ambiguity in language and non-verbal communication.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} This might also be combined with ''vagueness'', which arises when the boundaries of meaning are indistinct.{{clarify|date=September 2017}} The use of ambiguity and vagueness distracts the conscious mind as it tries to work out what is meant which gives the [[unconscious mind]] the opportunity to prosper.{{clarify|date=September 2017}}

;3. Indirect communication

The third aspect of the Milton model is that it is purposely vague and metaphoric for the purpose of accessing the unconscious mind. It is used to soften the meta model and make indirect suggestions.&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1976"&gt;Bandler, Richard &amp; John Grinder (1976). Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H. Erickson, M.D. Volume 1. Cupertino, CA :Meta Publications. {{ISBN|0-916990-01-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}} A direct suggestion merely states what is wanted, for example, "when you are in front of the audience you will not feel nervous". In contrast an indirect suggestion is less authoritative and leaves an opportunity for interpretation, for example, "When you are in front of the audience, you might find yourself feeling ever more confident". This example follows the indirect method leaving both the specific time and level of self-confidence unspecified. It might be made even more indirect by saying, "when you come to a decision to speak in public, you may find it appealing how your feelings have changed." The choice of speaking in front of the audience, the exact time and the likely responses to the whole process are framed but the imprecise language gives the client the opportunity to fill in the finer details.&lt;ref name="Zahourek 2002"&gt;Rothlyn P Zahourek. (2002) Utilizing Ericksonian hypnosis in psychiatric-mental health nursing practice  Perspectives in Psychiatric Care. Philadelphia: Jan-Mar 2002. Vol.38, Iss. 1;  pg. 15, 8 pgs&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representational systems==
{{main|Representational systems (NLP)}}
The notion that experience is processed by the sensory systems or representational systems, was incorporated into NLP from psychology and gestalt therapy shortly after its creation.&lt;ref name="Bandler &amp; Grinder 1979"/&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}} This teaches that people perceive the world through the senses and store the information from the senses in the mind. Memories are closely linked to sensory experience. When people are processing information they see images and hear sounds and voices and process this with internally created feelings. Some representations are within conscious awareness but information is largely processed at the unconscious level. When involved in any task, such as making conversation, describing a problem in therapy, reading a book, kicking a ball or riding a horse, their representational systems, consisting of [[Visual thinking|images]], [[sound]]s, [[kinesthetic|feelings]] (and possibly [[olfactory|smell]] and [[gustatory|taste]]) are being activated at the same time.&lt;ref name="Druckman &amp; Swets 1998"&gt;Druckman and Swets (eds) (1988) [http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309037921/html/133.html Enhancing Human Performance: Issues, Theories, and Techniques]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{synthesis inline|date=September 2017}} Moreover, the way representational systems are organised and the links between them impact on behavioral performance. Many NLP techniques rely on interrupting maladaptive patterns{{clarify|date=September 2017}} and replacing them with more positive and creative thought patterns which will in turn impact on behavior.&lt;ref name="Cooper and Seal 2006"&gt;Cooper and Seal (2006) "Theory and Approaches - Eclectic-integrative approaches: Neuro-linguistic programming" In Feldtham and Horton (Eds) The SAGE Handbook of Counselling and Psychotherapy 2e&lt;/ref&gt;

;Preferred representational systems
Originally, NLP taught that most people had an internal preferred representational system (PRS) and preferred to process information primarily in one sensory modality.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} The practitioner could ascertain this from external cues such as the direction of eye movements, posture, breathing, voice tone and the use of sensory-based predicates. If a person repeatedly used predicates such as "I can ''see'' a ''bright'' future for myself", the words "see" and "bright" would be considered visual predicates. In contrast "I can feel that we will be comfortable" would be considered primarily kinesthetic because of the predicates "feel" and "comfortable". These verbal cues could also be coupled with posture changes, skin color or breathing shifts. The theory was that the practitioner by matching and working within the preferred representational system could achieve better communication with the client and hence swifter and more effective results. Many trainings and standard works still teach PRS&lt;ref name="OConnor &amp; Seymour 2002"/&gt; whilst other proponents{{who|date=August 2017}} have de-emphasized the existence and relevance of PRS and instead emphasize working within all representational systems.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Responding directly to sensory experience requires an immediacy which respects the importance of context.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Grinder has stated that a representational system diagnosis lasts about 30 seconds.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Although there is some research that supports the notion that eye movements can indicate visual and auditory (but not kinesthetic) components of thought in that moment,&lt;ref name="Buckner 1987"&gt;Buckner, Meara, Reese, and Reese (1987) Journal of Counselling Psychology , Vol. 34(3), pp.283-287&lt;/ref&gt; the existence of a preferred representational system ascertainable from external cues (an important part of original NLP theory) was discounted by research in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Sharpley 1984"&gt;Sharpley, C. F. (1984). Predicate matching in NLP: A review of research on the preferred representational system.

;Submodalities
{{how-to|date=September 2017}}
Submodalities are the fine details of representational systems.{{clarify|date=September 2017}} In the late 1970s the developers of NLP started playing around{{tone inline|date=September 2017}} with the submodalities of representational systems involving the enhancement of visualisation techniques (common in sports psychology and meditation), by including other sensory systems.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Submodalities involve the relative size, location, brightness of internal images, the volume and direction of internal voices and sounds, and the location, texture, and movement of internally created sensations.&lt;ref name="Tosey &amp; Mathison 2003"&gt;Tosey, P. Jane Mathison (2003) Neuro-linguistic Programming and learning theory: a response ''The Curriculum Journal'' Vol.14 No.3 p.371-388 See also (available online): [http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/documents/00003319.htm Neuro-linguistic programming: its potential for learning and teaching in formal education]&lt;/ref&gt; Submodalities and hypnosis became the focus of Richard Bandler's later work.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} A typical change process may involve manipulating the submodalities of internal representations.{{clarify|date=September 2017}} For example, someone may see their future as 'dark and cloudy' with associated emotions, but would seek through NLP to perceive, and feel it, as 'light and clear'. Other training exercises develop a person's ability to move around internal images, change the quality of sounds and find out how these affect the intensity of internal feelings or other submodalities. Although NLP did not discover submodalities, it appears that the proponents of NLP may have been the first to systematically use manipulation of submodalities for therapeutic or personal development purposes, particularly phobias, compulsions and addictions.&lt;ref name="Dilts &amp; Delozier 2000"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dilts | first =  Robert B |author2=DeLozier, Judith A | title = Encyclopedia of Systemic Neuro-Linguistic Programming and NLP New Coding | publisher = NLP University Press |year= 2000  | url = http://www.nlpuniversitypress.com/ | isbn = 0-9701540-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable fringe source|date=September 2017}}

==Meta-programs==

Neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) uses the term 'meta-programs' specifically to indicate general, pervasive and usually habitual patterns used by an individual across a wide range of situations.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Examples of NLP meta-programs include the preference for overview or detail, the preference for where to place one's attention during conversation, habitual linguistic patterns and [[body language]], and so on.

Related concepts in other disciplines are known as [[cognitive styles]] or thinking styles.

In NLP, the term ''programs'' is used as a synonym for ''strategy'', which are specific sequences of mental steps, mostly indicated by their representational activity (using [[Representational systems (NLP)|VAKOG]]), leading to a behavioral outcome. In the entry for the term ''strategy'' in their Encyclopedia, [[Robert Dilts]] &amp; Judith Delozier explicitly refer to the mind as computer metaphor:
"A strategy is like a program in a computer.  It tells you what to do with the information you are getting, and like a computer program, you can use the same strategy to process a lot of different kinds of information."
In their encyclopedia, Dilts and Delozier then define metaprograms as:
"[programs] which guide and direct other thought processes. Specifically they define common or typical patterns in the strategies or thinking styles of a particular individual, group or culture."

The book 'Words that Change Minds' by Shelle Rose Charvet documents 13 distinct meta-programs categories affecting work-place motivation and performance, commonly known as the Language and Behaviour Profile or 'LAB Profile'. It is based on the work of Rodger Bailey and Ross Steward who wanted to make meta-programs usable to people without NLP training.

==Aphorisms/presuppositions==
Depending on the branch of NLP (different trainers or companies) the number and some of the content of the presuppositions may vary. Some of them are:
* The meaning of a communication is the response that you get (not the one intended).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Life and 'Mind' are Systemic Processes{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* [[Biopsychosocial model|Mind and body are parts of the same system and have influence over each other]]{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* [[Law of Requisite Variety]]{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* All behaviour is geared towards adaptation{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Behind every behavior is a positive intention{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* People are doing the best they can with the choices they have available{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Choice is better than no choice (and flexibility is the way one gets choice){{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Multiple descriptions are better than one{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Behaviour is to be evaluated and appreciated or changed as appropriate in the context presented{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* People already have all the resources they need to succeed{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* The highest quality information you can have of someone is their (present) behaviour.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* People are not their behaviour: accept people, change the behaviour (Also: Make distinction between behaviour and self).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* Every outcome manifested is Feedback: there is no failure, only feedback{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Techniques==
{{how-to|date=September 2017}}

===Anchoring===
NLP teaches that we constantly make "anchors" ([[Classical Conditioning]]) between what we see, hear and feel and our emotional states. While in an emotional state if a person is exposed to a unique stimulus (sight, sound or touch) then a connection is made between the emotion and the unique stimulus. If the unique stimulus occurs again, the emotional state will then be triggered. NLP teaches that anchors (such as a particular touch associated with a memory or state) can be deliberately created and triggered to help people access 'resourceful' or other target states.&lt;ref name="Krugman 1985"&gt;Krugman, Martin, ''et al.'', (1985): "Neuro-linguistic programming treatment for anxiety: Magic or myth?." Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology. Aug, Vol. 53(4) pp. 526-530.&lt;/ref&gt; Anchoring appears to have been imported into NLP from family therapy as part of the 'model' of [[Virginia Satir]].&lt;ref name="Haber 2002"&gt;Haber, Russell, (2002): Virginia Satir: An integrated, humanistic approach [[Contemporary Family Therapy]], Vol 24(1), Mar 2002,p32 pp. 23-34 ISSN 1573-3335 {{doi|10.1023/A:1014317420921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future pacing===
A technique of asking a person to [[Feedforward, Behavioral and Cognitive Science|imagine doing something in the future]] and monitoring their reactions. It is typically used to check that a change process has been successful; (i.e. by observing body language when the person imagines being in a difficult situation before and after an intervention). If the [[body language]] is the same then the [[Intervention (counseling)|intervention]] has not been successful. Future pacing can be used to "embed" change into the contexts of the future. It gives a person the experience of dealing positively with a situation before they get into that situation in reality. This is based on [[Mental image|visualization]] where the mind is assumed not to be able to tell the difference between a scenario which is real and one which has been clearly visualized.  The theory is that, having visualized positively, when the subject encounters the situation again in reality the visualized experience will serve as a model for how to behave, even though this experience was imagined. The mind cannot tell the difference between the visualization and reality so it accepts the visualization as reality and [[Accommodation (psychology)|makes the change]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Swish===
The swish pattern is a process that is designed to disrupt a pattern of thought from one that used to lead to an unwanted behavior to one that leads to a desired behavior.   This involves visualizing a 'cue' which leads into the unwanted behavior, such as a smokers hand moving towards the face with a cigarette in it, and reprogramming the mind to 'switch' to a visualization of the desired outcome, such as a healthy-looking person, energetic and fit. In addition to visualization, auditory sound effects are often imagined to enhance the experience.&lt;ref name="Masters et al. 1991"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Masters, B|author2=Rawlins, M|author3=Rawlins, L|author4=Weidner, J|year=1991|title=The NLP swish pattern: An innovative visualizing technique|journal=Journal of Mental Health Counseling|volume=13|issue=1|pages=79–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swish is one of the techniques that involves the manipulation of submodalities.

===Reframing===
Another technique, "reframing" functions through "changing the way you perceive an event and so changing the meaning.  When the meaning changes, responses and behaviors will also change. Reframing with language allows you to see the world in a different way and this changes the meaning. Reframing is the basis of jokes, myths, legends, fairy tales and most creative ways of thinking."&lt;ref name="Joseph O'Connor"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph O'Connor|title=NLP: A Practical Guide to Achieving the Results You Want: Workbook|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are examples in children's literature. [[Pollyanna]] would play [[The Glad Game]] whenever she felt down about life, to remind herself of the things that she could do, and not  worry about the things she couldn't. Alice Mills also says that this occurs in [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s story where to the surprise of the [[ugly duckling]], the beautiful creatures welcome and accept him; gazing at his reflection, he sees that he too is a swan.&lt;ref name="Mills 1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alice Mills |title=Pollyanna and the not so glad game|type= Children's Literature|publisher=Storrs|year=1999|volume=27|pages=87, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reframing is common to a number of therapies and was not original to NLP.&lt;ref name="Sharpley 1987"/&gt;{{rp|103–107, 105}}

An example of reframing is found in the "six-step reframe" which involves distinguishing between an underlying intention and the consequent behaviors for the purpose of achieving the intention by different and more successful behaviors. It is based on the notion that there is a positive intention behind all behaviors, but that the behaviors themselves may be unwanted or counterproductive in other ways. NLP uses this staged process to identify the intention and create alternative choices to satisfy that intention.

===Well-formed outcome===
In NLP this is one of a number of 'frames' wherein the desired state is considered as to its achievability and effect if achieved. A positive outcome must be defined by the client for their own use, be within the clients power to achieve, retain the positive products of the unwanted behaviors and produce an outcome that is appropriate for all circumstances.&lt;ref name="Dilts &amp; Delozier 2000"/&gt;

===Ecology===
This is a frame within which the desired outcome is checked against the consequences in the clients life and relationships from all angles.

===Parts integration===
"Parts Integration" is based on the idea that different aspects of ourselves are in conflict due to different perceptions and beliefs. 'Parts integration' is the process of integrating the disparate aspects of the self by identifying and then negotiating with the separate parts to achieve resolution of internal conflict. Parts integration appears to be modeled on 'parts' from [[family therapy]] and has similarities to [[ego-state therapy]] in psychoanalysis.

===VK/D===
VK/D stands for 'Visual/Kinesthetic Dissociation'. This is a technique designed to eliminate bad feelings associated with past events by re-running (like a film, sometimes in reverse) an associated memory in a [[Dissociation (neuropsychology)|dissociated]] state. It combines elements of Eriksonian techniques, spatial sorting processes from Fritz Perls, reframing and 'changing history' techniques.&lt;ref name="Dilts &amp; Delozier 2000"/&gt;

;Metaphor
Largely derived from the ideas of Bateson and the techniques of Erikson, 'metaphor' in NLP ranges from simple figures of speech to allegories and stories. It tends to be used in conjunction with the skills of the Milton model to create a story which operates on many levels with the intention of communicating with the unconscious and to find and challenge basic assumptions.&lt;ref name="OConnor &amp; Seymour 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dilts &amp; Delozier 2000"/&gt;

;State management
Sometimes called '''state control''', is a [[neuro-linguistic programming]] (NLP) technique involving actively trying to control the emotional and mental state of an individual. One method to actively achieve state management anchoring where an individual associates a particular physical [[stimulation|stimulus]]. It is used as both a self-help method and a therapeutic [[hypnotherapy]] technique.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Covert hypnosis===
{{Main|Covert hypnosis}}
Covert hypnosis is purportedly a method of using language patterns to hypnotise or persuade other people. Referred to as "sleight of mouth" by [[Robert Dilts]].&lt;ref name="Dilts 1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dilts, Robert|year=1999|title=Sleight of Mouth: The Magic of Conversational Belief Change|ISBN=0-916990-43-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; building off the phrase "[[sleight of hand]]", which refers to a magician's skills in making things happen which appear impossible.

'''Netmage'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netmage.it/ Netmage]&lt;/ref&gt; is an international festival dedicated to electronic art curated by Xing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xing.it/ XING]&lt;/ref&gt;  and produced annually—in the city of [[Bologna]]—as a multidisciplinary program of works, investigating and promoting contemporary audiovisual research. The festival was born in 2000 with funds provided by the [[European Union]], when Bologna represented one of the nine major [[European capital of culture]]. The festival concentrates on an amalgam of Happenings, environments, and audio/visual installations, it does through a concentration on creative scenes&lt;ref&gt;[http://arted.osu.edu/publications/pdf_files/paper38.pdf The creative Scene in Milano] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704051720/http://arted.osu.edu/publications/pdf_files/paper38.pdf |date=2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subcultural communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/squealer/butchhome/Ch_Scene/ch_scene_communication.htm CH-Scene: Communication Theories and Musical Communities by Butch Lazorchak]&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience of Netmage (eleven editions from 2001 to 2011) was merged into the annual [[Live Arts Week]].

==Mission==
The mission of Netmage is to  investigate the relationship between the  "liveness" and the "ambient space".
At the crossroads of these two terms is situated the notion of "post-cinema": defined as an environmental construction capable of gathering widely diverse attitudes in a public space.
&lt;ref name="popularFilm"&gt;{{cite book |title=Memory and Popular Film: Inside Popular Film|  first="Jeffrey"| last="Pence"  |editor="Paul Grainge"|publisher="Manchester UP"|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Post Cinema/Postmemory It is a cinema made of multi-projections on a number of screens with no seating, a multiplication of narrative traces, possible points of view, physical positions of the spectators; achieving a removal of the forced estrangement of the 20th Century spectator (the darkness of the room, physical and perceptive isolation, a monodirectional viewing perspective) that evoke the world of the first [[Happenings]] of the 1960s, the philosophy of [[expanded cinema]], and successive multimedia installation experiments of the 1980s.

=="Live Media"==

"[[Live Media]] is an open-ended term which has come into currency amongst artists and theoreticians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theatre_topics/v011/11.2saltz.html Live Media: Interactive Technology and Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://crca.ucsd.edu/views.php?id=6 Live Media Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Live-media relates to the gathering of relatively diverse practices capable of calling to mind the wide range of research by video producers, visual artists, musicians, sound artists, VJ's, filmmakers, designers and a range of creative people issued by creative scenes and subcultural communities.
Netmage and its curators have been instrumental in coining and promoting this term.

* utilization of electronic, digital or analogue platforms to generate images and sound;
* interaction consisting of visual and audio elements;
* inclusion of liveness (or randomness) as in any kind of performance.

Playing with stimuli, what is created in the live-media experience is a "privilege of variation" that in the first case goes from designer to public, in the second from public to executor. The confrontation is direct, dictated by the logic of the event.

"Dispositif" (post-cinema)&lt;ref name="popularFilm"/&gt; and practice (Live Media) thus represent two types of continuous variation through which Netmage questions possible currents in new media aesthetics, summoning artists and visual operators from diverse disciplines, in a context reminiscent of the [[Happening]].

Despite the complexity born from the exploration of this kind of space, ideal internal space, the  two axes—post-cinema and live media—intertwine and simply state what may be called a gathering, a togetherness of the community of producers, protagonists in the field of contemporary media, who both find themselves isolated; creating then a direct, interdisciplinary confrontation, thus filling a growing gap between hyper-connectivity on one hand, physical and social experience on the other.

==History==
The first edition of the festival was born in an historic watershed with a view on one side from the experiences of one of the last bastions of the Twentieth Century [[avantgarde]], [[video art]], and on the other toward a new front that was as yet undefined while the entire world of research visual production was poised to turn fully digital.

In the field of music, the 1990s had already anticipated a great deal of what was later to come in the visual world, pointing the way to a radical transformation in techniques, languages and methods of cultural consumption. Netmage, different from a number of other festivals dedicated to electronics born in the world of [[nightclub|clubbing]], has concentrated on the production of images, imagination and universal vision.
In eleven editions Netmage has produced and hosted over two hundred projects from over thirty countries (including Europe, Asia, The Americas, Oceania) offering a smattering of the most recent evolutions in the technological imagination and multiple currents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3891">In [[law]], '''nonacquiescence''' is the intentional failure by one branch of the government to comply with the decision of another to some degree.  It tends to arise only in governments that feature a strong [[separation of powers]], such as in the [[United States]], and is much rarer in governments where such powers are partly or wholly fused.  In the context of [[lawsuit]]s, [[executive branch|executive]] nonacquiescence in [[judiciary|judicial]] decisions can lead to bizarre [[Kafkaesque]] situations where parties discover to their chagrin that their legal victory over the government is an empty one.{{fact|date=March 2014}}{{POV-inline|date=March 2014}} Nonacquiescence can also possibly lead to a [[constitutional crisis]], given certain critical situations and decisions.

In the [[United States]], certain [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] agencies are notorious for practicing nonacquiescence (essentially, ignoring court decisions that go against them and refusing to accept their validity as [[binding precedent]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gregory C. Sisk, ''Litigation with the Federal Government'' (Philadelphia: American Law Institute, 2006), 418-425.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Hume, ''How Courts Impact Federal Administrative Behavior'' (New York: Routledge, 2009), 92-106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1017/CBO9780511493782.004 |chapter=Studying bureaucratic implementation of judicial policies in the United States: conceptual and methodological approaches |title=Judicial Review and Bureaucratic Impact |year=2004 |last1=Canon |first1=Bradley C. |editor1-last=Hertogh |editor1-first=Marc |editor2-last=Halliday |editor2-first=Simon |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-511-49378-2 |pages=76–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Social Security Administration]] and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] are particularly well known for such conduct.&lt;ref&gt;The SSA publishes [http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/rulings/ Acquiescence Rulings] and the IRS publishes [https://www.irs.gov/app/picklist/list/actionsOnDecisions.html Actions on Decisions], in which they state whether they will obey a particular court decision or not.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although executive nonacquiescence has been heavily criticized by the federal courts,&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''Hutchison v. Chater'', 99 F.3d 286, 287-88 (8th Cir. 1996); ''Johnson v. U.S. Railroad Retirement Board'', 969 F.2d 1082 (D.C. Cir. 1992); ''Allegheny General Hospital v. NLRB'', 608 F.2d 965 (3d Cir. 1979); and ''Lopez v. Heckler'', 713 F.2d 1432 (9th Cir.), rev'd on other grounds sub nomine ''Heckler v. Lopez'', 463 U.S. 1328 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[American Bar Association]],&lt;ref&gt;Rhonda McMillion, "A Little Compliance Can't Hurt," ''[[ABA Journal]]'', August 1997, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] has not yet been able to pass a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] formally prohibiting or punishing such behavior.{{POV-inline|date=March 2014}}

The [[United States|U.S.]] [[Internal Revenue Service | Internal Revenue Service (IRS)]] uses the term ''nonacquiescence'' in its actions on decision to indicate that the IRS disagrees with a court ruling and will not follow its precedent nationwide.&lt;ref name="irs36"&gt;{{cite web|title=Internal Revenue Manual, 36.3.1.4|url=https://www.irs.gov/irm/part36/irm_36-003-001.html#d0e157|publisher=Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dept of Treasury|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This does not necessarily mean that the IRS will refuse to follow the ruling of the court on that particular case; rather it means that the IRS will not apply the ruling to ''other'' cases.  In some cases of nonacquiesence, the IRS may follow the decision's precedent within the jurisdiction of the case in question, but not apply it in other jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="irs36"/&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and guide to [[category theory]], the area of study in [[mathematics]] that examines in an [[abstraction|abstract]] way the properties of particular mathematical concepts, by formalising them as collections of ''objects'' and ''arrows'' (also called [[morphism]]s, although this term also has a specific, non category-theoretical sense), where these collections satisfy certain basic conditions.  Many significant areas of mathematics can be formalised as categories, and the use of category theory allows many intricate and subtle mathematical results in these fields to be stated, and proved, in a much simpler way than without the use of categories.

'''Peter Collett''' (1767 – 1823) was a Danish judge and writer.

He was born in [[Zealand]] as a brother of [[Johan Collett|Johan]] and [[Jonas Collett]]. He was a rationalist and radical,&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Peter Collett – dansk politisk forfatter|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Peter_Collett/dansk_politisk_forfatter|language=Norwegian|accessdate=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he published a long and favorable review of [[Michael Gottlieb Birckner]]s 1797 book ''On the Freedom of the Press and its Law'', where amongst other things he defended the freedom to call for sedition as well as the right for government officials to profess [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;H. Arnold Barton, ''Scandinavia in the Revolutionary Era 1760-1815'', University of Minnesota Press, 1986, p.241.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he was fired from his position as an [[Assessor (law)|assessor]] in [[Copenhagen]] for this.&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

The editor of ''Lærde Efterretninger'' [[Rasmus Nyerup]] offered him his position as editor of this magazine, and later he accepted the position as co-editor of the popular journal ''Minerva''. He wrote numerous articles for these journals, many of them overtly critical of the government, as well as translations of texts by the English philosopher [[Francis Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=N2oZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA306#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Thomas Hansen Erslew, ''Almindeligt Forfatter-Lexicon for Kongeriget Danmark med tilhørende Bilande'', vol. 1, 1843, pp. 306-7].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1800 he emigrated to the [[Danish West Indies]].&lt;ref name=snl/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3646">'''PhySH''', an abbreviation for '''Physics Subject Headings''', is a classification scheme developed by the [[American Physical Society]] (APS) as an universal classification scheme covering all branches of physics including astronomy, quantum computation, and physics education.&lt;ref&gt;New Physics Classification Scheme Unveiled, https://physh.aps.org/about&lt;/ref&gt; This scheme has been unveiled in January 2016. It substitutes the previous [[Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme]] (PACS) of the [[American Institute of Physics]] (AIP)&lt;ref&gt;PACS 2010,https://www.aip.org/publishing/pacs/pacs-2010-regular-edition&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently the working tool for all journals of APS and all scientific Conferences and Meetings called by APS.

== Brief History ==

PACS has been created by AIP in 1970s and AIP maintained and updated it until 2010, when AIP decided to keep PACS 2010 as its final version &lt;ref&gt;APS NEWS, E. Conover, New Physics Classification Scheme Unveiled, https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201602/classification.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; because of the inherent limitations to the PACS system.&lt;ref&gt;AIP Thesaurus Replaces PACS, https://www.aip.org/publishing/pacs&lt;/ref&gt; Under these conditions, and confronted with the necessity to operate an efficient classification system well accommodated to fast developments in various branches of physics, APS developed its own PhySH system. The development of PhySH started in 2012, and it has been unveiled in January 2016. Being word based, i.e., operating with regular English words rather than formal PACS codes, PhySH is much more intuitive than PACS. Also, new concepts originating in the course of the development of science can be organically incorporated into PhySH which creates a basis for its further development. Perpetual development is the idea laid into the basis of PhySH system which is expected to become the internationally recognized standard.

== Basics of PhySH ==

PhySH is based on three principal definitions: Disciplines, Facets, and Concepts. Their meaning can be best understood by browsing the PhySH webpage.&lt;ref&gt;Browse PhySH, https://physh.aps.org/browse?facetIds=all&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently 17 disciplines, from Accelerators &amp; Beams, through Biological Physics and Networks, to Statistical Physics. Five facets include Research Areas, Physical Systems, Properties, Techniques, and Professional topics. Clicking on them opens lists of related concepts. Using the Search option for a specific term opens a string, or a set of strings, each of them beginning with the related facet that is followed by a set of concepts, beginning from broader and going to more specific. E.g., searching for Van der Waals results in three strings. One of them reads as:

Physical systems &gt; 3-dimensional systems &gt; Complex materials &gt; Heterostructures &gt; Van der Waals heterostructures

Such architecture of PhySH allows its easy extension, and PhySH is considered as a permanently developing rather than finished project. Authors of papers submitted to American physical journals are encouraged to provide editors with PhySH terms to assist in choosing proper reviewers, and some journals even require providing PhySH terms. PhySH is expected to expand with the grows of physics, and this should happen technically through the input coming from authors, reviewers, editors, and organizers of scientific conferences.

'''Prejudice''', or '''bigotry''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=English Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=123|year=1855|issue=8|pages=113-116}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an affective feeling towards a person or group member based solely on that person's group membership (tribal behavior). The word is often used to refer to preconceived, usually unfavorable, feelings towards people or a person because of their [[sex]], [[gender]], [[belief]]s, [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[social class]], [[Ageing|age]], [[disability]], [[religion]], [[sexual orientation|sexuality]], [[Race (human classification)|race]]/[[ethnicity]], [[language]], [[nationality]], [[beauty]], [[job|occupation]], [[education]], [[criminality]], [[Fan loyalty|sport team affiliation]] or other personal characteristics. In this case, it refers to a positive or negative evaluation of another person based on that person's perceived group membership.&lt;ref&gt;Dovidio, J. F., &amp; Gaertner. S. L. (2010). "Intergroup bias". In S. T. Fiske, D. T. Gilbert, &amp; G. Lindzey (Eds.), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Pye5IkCFgRYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Prejudice&amp;f=false The Handbook of Social Psychology]'' (5th ed., Vol. 2). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prejudice can also refer to unfounded or [[pigeonholed]] beliefs&lt;ref&gt;Turiel, Elliot. "[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0165025407083670 Commentary: The problems of prejudice, discrimination, and exclusion]." International Journal of Behavioral Development 31.5 (2007): 419-422.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William James]] wrote: "A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices." [http://www.freemaninstitute.com/quotes.htm Quotable Quotes – Courtesy of The Freeman Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; and it may include "any unreasonable attitude that is unusually resistant to rational influence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosnow |first1=Ralph L. |title=Poultry and Prejudice |journal=Psychologist Today |date=March 1972 |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=53–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Allport]] defined prejudice as a "feeling, favorable or unfavorable, toward a person or thing, prior to, or not based on, actual experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allport|first=Gordon|title=The Nature of Prejudice|year=1979|publisher=Perseus Books Publishing|isbn=0-201-00179-9|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the evolutionary psychology perspective, see [[Prejudice from an evolutionary perspective]]. [[Lene_Auestad|Auestad]] (2015) defines prejudice as characterized by 'symbolic transfer', transfer of a value-laden meaning content onto a socially formed category and then on to individuals who are taken to belong to that category, resistance to change, and overgeneralization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Auestad|first1=Lene|title=Respect, Plurality, and Prejudice|date=2015|publisher=Karnac|location=London|isbn=9781782201397|pages=xxi–xxii|edition=1|url=http://www.karnacbooks.com/product/respect-plurality-and-prejudice-a-psychoanalytical-and-philosophical-enquiry-into-the-dynamics-of-social-exclusion-and-discrimination/35283/?MATCH=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical approaches==
The first [[psychological research]] conducted on prejudice occurred in the 1920s. This research attempted to prove [[white supremacy]]. One article from 1925 which reviewed 73 studies on race concluded that the studies seemed "to indicate the mental superiority of the white race".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0075064 |title=A review of race psychology |year=1930 |last1=Garth |first1=T. Rooster. |journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]] |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=329–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies, along with other research, led many psychologists to view prejudice as a natural response to inferior races.

In the 1930s and 1940s, this perspective began to change due to the increasing concern about [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]]. At the time, theorists viewed prejudice as pathological and they thus looked for personality syndromes linked with [[racism]]. [[Theodor Adorno]] believed that prejudice stemmed from an [[authoritarian personality]]; he believed that people with authoritarian personalities were the most likely to be prejudiced against groups of lower status. He described authoritarians as "rigid thinkers who obeyed authority, saw the world as [[black and white thinking|black and white]], and enforced strict adherence to social rules and hierarchies".&lt;ref name="Plous, S 2011"&gt;Plous, S. "[http://www.understandingprejudice.org/apa/english/ The Psychology of Prejudice]". Understanding Prejudice.org. Web. 07 Apr. 2011.{{vs|where's the URL?|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, [[Gordon Allport]], in his classic work ''[[The Nature of Prejudice]]'', linked prejudice to categorical thinking. Allport claimed that prejudice is a natural and normal process for humans. According to him, "The human mind must think with the aid of categories… Once formed, categories are the basis for normal prejudgment. We cannot possibly avoid this process. Orderly living depends upon it."&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W. (1954). ''The Nature of Prejudice''. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, research began to show that prejudice tends to be based on [[In-group favoritism|favoritism towards one's own groups]], rather than negative feelings towards another group. According to [[Marilyn Brewer]], prejudice "may develop not because [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroups]] are hated, but because positive emotions such as admiration, sympathy, and trust are reserved for the ingroup."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00126 |title=The Psychology of Prejudice: Ingroup Love and Outgroup Hate? |year=1999 |last1=Brewer |first1=Marilynn B. |journal=[[Journal of Social Issues]] |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=429–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, [[Thomas Pettigrew]] described the [[ultimate attribution error]] and its role in prejudice. The ultimate attribution error occurs when ingroup members "(1) attribute negative outgroup behavior to dispositional causes (more than they would for identical ingroup behavior), and (2) attribute positive outgroup behavior to one or more of the following causes: (a) a fluke or exceptional case, (b) luck or special advantage, (c) high motivation and effort, and (d) situational factors."&lt;ref name="Plous, S 2011"/&gt;

[[Elisabeth_Young-Bruehl|Youeng-Bruehl]] (1996) argued that prejudice cannot be treated in the singular; one should rather speak of different prejudices as characteristic of different character types. Her theory defines prejudices as being social defences, distinguishing between an obsessional character structure, primarily linked with anti-semitism, hysterical characters, primarily associated with racism, and narcissistic characters, linked with sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young-Bruehl|first1=Elizabeth|title=An Anatomy of Prejudices|date=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9780674031913|page=38|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674031913&amp;content=reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary theories and empirical findings==

The [[out-group homogeneity]] effect is the perception that members of an out-group are more similar (homogenous) than members of the in-group. Social psychologists Quattrone and Jones conducted a study demonstrating this with students from the rival schools [[Princeton University]] and [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.38.1.141 |title=The perception of variability within in-groups and out-groups: Implications for the law of small numbers |year=1980 |last1=Quattrone |first1=George A. |last2=Jones |first2=Edward E. |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=38 |pages=141–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students at each school were shown videos of other students from each school choosing a type of music to listen to for an auditory perception study. Then the participants were asked to guess what percentage of the videotaped students' classmates would choose the same. Participants predicted a much greater similarity between out-group members (the rival school) than between members of their in-group.

The justification-suppression model of prejudice was created by Christian Crandall and Amy Eshleman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.414 |title=A justification-suppression model of the expression and experience of prejudice |year=2003 |last1=Crandall |first1=Christian S. |last2=Eshleman |first2=Amy |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=414–46 |pmid=12784937}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model explains that people face a conflict between the desire to express prejudice and the desire to maintain a positive [[self-concept]]. This conflict causes people to search for justification for disliking an out-group, and to use that justification to avoid negative feelings ([[cognitive dissonance]]) about themselves when they act on their dislike of the out-group.

The [[realistic conflict theory]] states that competition between limited resources leads to increased negative prejudices and discrimination. This can be seen even when the resource is insignificant. In the Robber's Cave experiment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Muzafer |last1=Sherif |first2=O. J. |last2=Harvey |first3=B. Jack |last3=White |first4=William R. |last4=Hood |first5=Carolyn W. |last5=Sherif |year=1988 |title=The Robbers Cave Experiment: Intergroup Conflict and Cooperation |location=Middletown, Connecticut |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |isbn=978-0-8195-6194-7}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; negative prejudice and hostility was created between two summer camps after sports competitions for small prizes. The hostility was lessened after the two competing camps were forced to cooperate on tasks to achieve a common goal.

Another contemporary theory is the [[integrated threat theory]] (ITT), which was developed by Walter G Stephan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2000.tb01022.x |title=Women's Attitudes Toward Men: an Integrated Threat Theory Approach |year=2000 |last1=Stephan |first1=Cookie White |last2=Stephan |first2=Walter C. |last3=Demitrakis |first3=Katherine M. |last4=Yamada |first4=Ann Marie |last5=Clason |first5=Dennis L. |journal=[[Psychology of Women Quarterly]] |volume=24 |pages=63–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; It draws from and builds upon several other psychological explanations of prejudice and ingroup/outgroup behaviour, such as the realistic conflict theory and [[symbolic racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1004_4 |title=Intergroup Threat and Outgroup Attitudes: A Meta-Analytic Review |year=2006 |last1=Riek |first1=Blake M. |last2=Mania |first2=Eric W. |last3=Gaertner |first3=Samuel L. |journal=[[Personality and Social Psychology Review]] |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=336–53 |pmid=17201592}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also uses the [[social identity theory]] perspective as the basis for its validity; that is, it assumes that individuals operate in a group-based context where group memberships form a part of individual identity. ITT posits that outgroup prejudice and discrimination is caused when individuals perceive an outgroup to be threatening in some way. ITT defines four threats: 
* Realistic threats
* Symbolic threats
* Intergroup anxiety
* Negative stereotypes

Realistic threats are tangible, such as competition for a natural resource or a threat to income. Symbolic threats arise from a perceived difference in cultural values between groups or a perceived imbalance of power (for example, an ingroup perceiving an outgroup's religion as incompatible with theirs). Intergroup anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness experienced in the presence of an outgroup or outgroup member, which constitutes a threat because interactions with other groups cause negative feelings (e.g., a threat to comfortable interactions). Negative stereotypes are similarly threats, in that individuals anticipate negative behaviour from outgroup members in line with the perceived stereotype (for example, that the outgroup is violent). Often these stereotypes are associated with emotions such as fear and anger. ITT differs from other threat theories by including intergroup anxiety and negative stereotypes as threat types.

Additionally, [[social dominance theory]] states that society can be viewed as group-based hierarchies. In competition for scarce resources such as housing or employment, dominant groups create prejudiced "legitimizing myths" to provide moral and intellectual justification for their dominant position over other groups and validate their claim over the limited resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.476 |title=Racism, conservatism, Affirmative Action, and intellectual sophistication: A matter of principled conservatism or group dominance? |year=1996 |last1=Sidanius |first1=Jim |last2=Pratto |first2=Felicia |last3=Bobo |first3=Lawrence |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=476–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legitimizing myths, such as discriminatory hiring practices or biased merit norms, work to maintain these prejudiced hierarchies.

Prejudice can be a central contributing factor to depression.&lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1745691612455204 |title=Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Depression: The Integrated Perspective |year=2012 |last1=Cox |first1=William T. L. |last2=Abramson |first2=Lyn Y. |last3=Devine |first3=Patricia G. |last4=Hollon |first4=Steven D. |journal=[[Perspectives on Psychological Science]] |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=427–49 |pmid=26168502}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can occur in someone who is a prejudice victim, being the target of someone else's prejudice, or when people have prejudice against themselves that causes their own depression.

Paul Bloom argues that while prejudice can be irrational and have terrible consequences, it is natural and often quite rational. This is because prejudices are based on the human tendency to categorise objects and people based on prior experience. This means people make predictions about things in a category based on prior experience with that category, with the resulting predictions usually being accurate (though not always). Bloom argues that this process of categorisation and prediction is necessary for survival and normal interaction, quoting William Hazlitt, who stated "Without the aid of prejudice and custom, I should not be able to find my way my across the room; nor know how to conduct myself in any circumstances, nor what to feel in any relation of life".&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Paul [https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_bloom_can_prejudice_ever_be_a_good_thing/transcript "Can prejudice ever be a good thing"] January 2014, accessed 02/12/17&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, researchers have argued that the study of prejudice has been traditionally too narrow. It is argued that since prejudice is defined as a negative affect towards members of a group, there are many groups against whom prejudice is acceptable (such as rapists, men who abandon their families, pedophiles, neo-Nazis, drink-drivers, queue jumpers, murderers etc.), yet such prejudices aren't studied. It has been suggested that researchers have focused too much on an evaluative approach to prejudice, rather than a descriptive approach, which looks at the actual psychological mechanisms behind prejudiced attitudes. It is argued that this limits research to targets of prejudice to groups deemed to be receiving unjust treatment, while groups researchers deem treated justly or deservedly of prejudice are overlooked. As a result, the scope of prejudice has begun to expand in research, allowing a more accurate analysis of the relationship between psychological traits and prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crandell |first1= Christian S. |last2=Ferguson |first2=Mark A. |last3=Bahns |first3=Angela J.|editor-last1=Stangor |editor-first1=Charles |editor-last2=Crendeall |editor-first2=Christian S. |title=Stereotyping and Prejudice |publisher=Psychology Press |date=2013 |chapter=Chapter 3: When We See Prejudice |isbn=978-1848726444}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Jarret, and Mark J.

==Controversies and prominent topics==
One can be prejudiced against or have a preconceived notion about someone due to any characteristic they find to be unusual or undesirable. A few commonplace examples of prejudice are those based on someone's race, gender, nationality, social status, sexual orientation, or religious affiliation, and controversies may arise from any given topic.

===Sexism===
{{Main article|Sexism}}
Sexism, also called gender discrimination, is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's [[Sex and gender distinction|sex or gender]]. Sexism can affect either gender, but it is particularly documented as affecting women and girls.&lt;ref name="Sexism"&gt;There is a clear and broad consensus among academic scholars in multiple fields that sexism refers primarily to discrimination against women, and primarily affects women. See, for example:
*{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=New Oxford American Dictionary |title=Sexism |access-date= |edition=3 |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199891535}} Defines sexism as "prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex."
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica, Online Academic Edition |year=2015}} Defines sexism as "prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender, especially against women and girls." Notes that "sexism in a society is most commonly applied against women and girls.  It functions to maintain patriarchy, or male domination, through ideological and material practices of individuals, collectives, and institutions that oppress women and girls on the basis of sex or gender."
*{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Cudd|first1=Ann E.|last2=Jones|first2=Leslie E.|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=A Companion to Applied Ethics |year=2005 |publisher=Blackwell |location=London}} Notes that "'Sexism' refers to a historically and globally pervasive form of oppression against women."
*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Masequesmay|first=Gina|editor-last=O'Brien|editor-first=Jodi|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Gender and Society |year=2008 |publisher=SAGE}} Notes that "sexism usually refers to prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender, especially against women and girls." Also states that "sexism is an ideology or practices that maintain patriarchy or male domination." 
*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hornsby |first=Jennifer|editor-last=Honderich|editor-first=Ted|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |edition=2 |year=2005|publisher=Oxford}} Defines sexism as "thought or practice which may permeate language and which assume's women's inferiority to men."
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Collins Dictionary of Sociology  |year=2006 |publisher=Harper Collins}} Defines sexism as "any devaluation or denigration of women or men, but particularly women, which is embodied in institutions and social relationships."
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Palgrave MacMillan Dictionary of Political Thought |year=2007 |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan}} Notes that "either sex may be the object of sexist attitudes... however, it is commonly held that, in developed societies, women have been the usual victims."
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Love, Courtship, and Sexuality through History, Volume 6: The Modern World |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood}} "Sexism is any act, attitude, or institutional configuration that systematically subordinates or devalues women.  Built upon the belief that men and women are constitutionally different, sexism takes these differences as indications that men are inherently superior to women, which then is used to justify the nearly universal dominance of men in social and familial relationships, as well as politics, religion, language, law, and economics."
*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Foster |first=Carly Hayden |editor-last=Kurlan|editor-first=George Thomas|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Political Science |title=Sexism |year=2011 |publisher=CQ Press|isbn=9781608712434}} Notes that "both men and women can experience sexism, but sexism against women is more pervasive."
*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Johnson|first=Allan G.|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology |year=2000 |publisher=Blackwell |location= |id= }} Suggests that "the key test of whether something is sexist... lies in its consequences: if it supports male privilege, then it is by definition sexist. I specify 'male privilege' because in every known society where gender inequality exists, males are privileged over females."
*{{cite book |last=Lorber |first=Judith |year=2011 |title=Gender Inequality: Feminist Theories and Politics |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=5}} Notes that "although we speak of gender inequality, it is usually women who are disadvantaged relative to similarly situated men."
*{{cite book |last1=Wortman |first1=Camille B. |last2=Loftus |first2=Elizabeth S. |last3=Weaver |first3=Charles A |title=Psychology |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1999}} "As throughout history, today women are the primary victims of sexism, prejudice directed at one sex, even in the United States."
&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion of such sentiments, and actual gender differences and stereotypes continue to be controversial topics. Throughout history, women have been thought of as being subordinate to men, often being ignored in areas like the academia or belittled altogether. Traditionally, men were thought of as being more capable than women, mentally and physically.&lt;ref name="Dovidio"&gt;Dovidio, John, Peter Glick, and Laurie Rudman. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CDSyHPt98E0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On the Nature of Prejudice]''. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2005. 108. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of social psychology, prejudice studies like the "Who Likes Competent Women" study led the way for gender-based research on prejudice.&lt;ref name="Dovidio" /&gt; This resulted in two broad themes or focuses in the field: the first being a focus on attitudes toward [[gender equality]], and the second focusing on people's beliefs about men and women.&lt;ref name="Dovidio" /&gt; Today, studies based on sexism continue in the field of psychology as researchers try to understand how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors influence and are influenced by others.

===Nationalism===
{{Main article|Nationalism}}
Nationalism is a sentiment based on common cultural characteristics that binds a population and often produces a policy of national independence or [[separatism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nationalism "Nationalism"], dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; It suggests a "shared identity" amongst a nation's people that minimizes differences within the group and emphasizes perceived boundaries between the group and non-members.&lt;ref name="Blackwell, Judith 2003 p31-2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blackwell |first1=Judith |first2=Murray |last2=Smith |first3=John |last3=Sorenson |title=Culture of Prejudice: Arguments in Critical Social Science |location=Toronto |publisher=Broadview Press |year=2003 |pages=31–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the assumption that members of the nation have more in common than they actually do, that they are "culturally unified", even if injustices within the nation based on differences like status and race exist.&lt;ref name="Blackwell, Judith 2003 p31-2"/&gt; During times of conflict between one nation and another, nationalism is controversial since it may function as a buffer for criticism when it comes to the nation's own problems since it makes the nation's own hierarchies and internal conflicts appear to be natural.&lt;ref name="Blackwell, Judith 2003 p31-2"/&gt; It may also serve a way of rallying the people of the nation in support of a particular political goal.&lt;ref name="Blackwell, Judith 2003 p31-2"/&gt; Nationalism usually involves a push for conformity, obedience, and solidarity amongst the nation's people and can result not only in feelings of public responsibility but also in a narrow sense of community due to the exclusion of those who are considered outsiders.&lt;ref name="Blackwell, Judith 2003 p31-2"/&gt; Since the identity of nationalists is linked to their allegiance to the state, the presence of strangers who do not share this allegiance may result in hostility.&lt;ref name="Blackwell, Judith 2003 p31-2"/&gt;

===Classism===
{{Main article|Classism}}
Classism is defined by [[dictionary.com]] as "a biased or discriminatory attitude on distinctions made between social or economic classes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/classism "Classism"], dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of separating people based on class is controversial in itself. Some argue that [[economic inequality]] is an unavoidable aspect of society, so there will always be a ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, Judith, Murray Smith, and John Sorenson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zUbvP87QKX0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Culture of Prejudice: Arguments in Critical Social Science]''. Toronto: Broadview Press, 2003. 145. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some also argue that, even within the most [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] societies in history, some form of ranking based on social status takes place. Therefore, one may believe the existence of social classes is a natural feature of society.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Blackwell, Judith, Murray Smith, and John Sorenson. ''Culture of Prejudice: Arguments in Critical Social Science''. Toronto: Broadview Press, 2003. 146. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue the contrary. According to [[Anthropology|anthropological]] evidence, for the majority of the time the human species has been in existence, humans have lived in a manner in which the land and resources were not privately owned.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Also, when social ranking did occur, it was not antagonistic or hostile like the current class system.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This evidence has been used to support the idea that the existence of a social class system is unnecessary. Overall, society has neither come to a consensus over the necessity of the class system, nor been able to deal with the hostility and prejudice that occurs because of the class system.

===Sexual discrimination===
{{Main article|Sexual discrimination|Homophobia}}
One's sexual orientation is the "direction of one's sexual interest toward members of the same, opposite, or both sexes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexual+orientation "Sexual Orientation"], dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; Like most minority groups, [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]s and [[Bisexuality|bisexuals]] are not immune to prejudice or stereotypes from the majority group. They may experience hatred from others because of their sexual preferences; a term for such intense hatred based upon one's sexual orientation is ''[[homophobia]]''.

Due to what social psychologists call the vividness effect, a tendency to notice only certain distinctive characteristics, the majority population tends to draw conclusions like gays flaunt their sexuality.&lt;ref name="Anderson, Kristin 2010"&gt;Anderson, Kristin. ''Benign Bigotry: The Psychology of Subtle Prejudice''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010. 198. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Such images may be easily recalled to mind due to their vividness, making it harder to appraise the entire situation.&lt;ref name="Anderson, Kristin 2010"/&gt; The majority population may not only think that homosexuals flaunt their sexuality or are "too gay", but may also erroneously believe that homosexuals are easy to identify and label as being gay or lesbian when compared to others who are not homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Kristin. ''Benign Bigotry: The Psychology of Subtle Prejudice''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010. 200. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of [[heterosexual privilege]] seems to flourish in society. Research and questionnaires are formulated to fit the majority; i.e., [[Heterosexuality|heterosexuals]]. This discussion of whether heterosexuals are the privileged group and whether homosexuals are a minimized group is controversial. Research shows that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a powerful feature of many labor markets. For example, controlling for human capital, studies show that gay men earn 10% - 32% less than heterosexual men in the United States, and that there is significant discrimination in hiring on the basis of sexual orientation in many labor markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tilcsik | first1 = A | year = 2011 | title = Pride and Prejudice: Employment Discrimination against Openly Gay Men in the United States | url = | journal = [[American Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 117 | issue = 2| pages = 586–626 | pmid = 22268247 | doi=10.1086/661653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racism===
Racism is defined as the belief that physical characteristics determine cultural traits, and that racial characteristics make some groups superior.&lt;ref name="Blackwell37"&gt;Blackwell, Judith, Murray Smith, and John Sorenson. ''Culture of Prejudice: Arguments in Critical Social Science''. Toronto: Broadview Press, 2003. 37–38. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; By separating people into [[Racial hierarchy|hierarchies]] based upon their race, it has been argued that unequal treatment among the different groups of people is just and fair due to their [[Genetics|genetic]] differences.&lt;ref name="Blackwell37" /&gt; Racism can occur amongst any group that can be identified based upon physical features or even characteristics of their culture.&lt;ref name="Blackwell37" /&gt; Though people may be lumped together and called a specific race, everyone does not fit neatly into such categories, making it hard to define and describe a race accurately.&lt;ref name="Blackwell37" /&gt;

[[Scientific racism]] began to flourish in the eighteenth century and was greatly influenced by [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[evolution]]ary studies, as well as ideas taken from the writings of philosophers like [[Aristotle]]; for example, Aristotle believed in the concept of "[[Natural slavery|natural slaves]]".&lt;ref name="Blackwell37" /&gt; This concept focuses on the necessity of hierarchies and how some people are bound to be on the bottom of the pyramid. Though racism has been a prominent topic in history, there is still debate over whether race actually exists,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} making the discussion of race a controversial topic. Even though the concept of race is still being debated, the effects of racism are apparent. Racism and other forms of prejudice can affect a person's behavior, thoughts, and feelings, and social psychologists strive to study these effects.

===Religious discrimination===
{{Main article|Religious discrimination}}

While various religions teach their members to be tolerant of those who are different and to have compassion, throughout history there have been [[Religious war|wars]], [[pogrom]]s and other forms of violence motivated by hatred of religious groups.&lt;ref name="Dovidio, John 2005"&gt;Dovidio, John, Peter Glick, and Laurie Rudman. ''On the Nature of Prejudice''. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2005. 413. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern world, researchers in western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic countries have done various studies exploring the relationship between religion and prejudice; thus far, they have received mixed results. A study done with US college students found that those who reported religion to be very influential in their lives seem to have a higher rate of prejudice than those who reported not being religious.&lt;ref name="Dovidio, John 2005"/&gt; Other studies found that religion has a positive effect on people as far as prejudice is concerned.&lt;ref name="Dovidio, John 2005"/&gt; This difference in results may be attributed to the differences in religious practices or religious interpretations amongst the individuals. Those who practice "institutionalized religion", which focuses more on social and political aspects of religious events, are more likely to have an increase in prejudice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Dovidio, John, Peter Glick, and Laurie Rudman. ''On the Nature of Prejudice''. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2005. 414. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who practice "interiorized religion", in which believers devote themselves to their beliefs, are most likely to have a decrease in prejudice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Linguistic discrimination===
{{Main article|Linguistic discrimination}}

Individuals or groups may be treated unfairly based solely on their use of language. This use of language may include the individual's [[native language]] or other characteristics of the person's speech, such as an [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]], the size of [[vocabulary]] (whether the person uses complex and varied words), and [[syntax]]. It may also involve a person's ability or inability to use one language instead of another.
In the mid-1980s, [[linguistics|linguist]] Tove Skutnabb-Kangas captured this idea of discrimination based on language as the concept of linguicism. Kangas defined linguicism as the ideologies and structures used to "legitimate, effectuate, and reproduce unequal division of power and resources (both material and non-material) between groups which are defined on the basis of language."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Skutnabb-Kangas, Tove, and Phillipson, Robert, {{"'}}Mother Tongue': The Theoretical and Sociopolitical Construction of a Concept". In Ammon, Ulrich (ed.) (1989), ''Status and Function of Languages and Language Varieties'', p. 455. Berlin, New York: Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co. {{ISBN|3-11-011299-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurological discrimination===
{{Main article|Neurodiversity}}
{{See also|Ableism}}
Broadly speaking, attribution of low social status to those who do not conform to [[neurotypical]] expectations of personality and behaviour. This can manifest through assumption of 'disability' status to those who are high functioning enough to exist outside of diagnostic criteria, yet do not desire to (or are unable to) conform their behaviour to conventional patterns. This is a controversial and somewhat contemporary concept; with various disciplinary approaches promoting conflicting messages what normality constitutes, the degree of acceptable [[Differential psychology|individual difference]] within that category, and the precise criteria for what constitutes medical disorder. This has been most prominent in the case of high-functioning autism,&lt;ref name="Silberman, Steve 2015"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WRpPDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false NeuroTribes: The legacy of autism and how to think smarter about people who think differently]''.

Discrimination may also extend to other high functioning individuals carrying pathological phenotypes, such as those with [[ADHD|attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] and [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar spectrum disorders]]. In these cases, there are indications that perceived (or actual) socially disadvantageous cognitive traits are directly correlated with advantageous cognitive traits in other domains, notably creativity and divergent thinking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet these strengths might become systematically overlooked. The case for "neurological discrimination" as such lies in the expectation that one's professional capacity may be judged by the quality of ones social interaction, which can in such cases be an inaccurate and discriminatory metric for employment suitability.

Since there are moves by some experts to have these higher-functioning extremes reclassified as extensions of human personality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| pages=873–883}}&lt;/ref&gt; any legitimisation of discrimination against these groups would fit the very definition of prejudice, as medical validation for such discrimination becomes redundant. Recent advancements in [[behavioural genetics]] and [[neuroscience]] have made this a very relevant issue of discussion, with existing frameworks requiring significant overhaul to accommodate the strength of findings over the last decade.

==Multiculturalism==
{{Main article|Multiculturalism}}
Humans have an evolved propensity to think categorically about social groups, manifested in cognitive processes with broad implications for public and political endorsement of multicultural policy, according to psychologists [[Richard J. Crisp]] and Rose Meleady.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1219009 |title=Adapting to a Multicultural Future |year=2012 |last1=Crisp |first1=Richard J. |last2=Meleady |first2=Rose |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=336 |issue=6083 |pages=853–5 |pmid=22605761|bibcode=2012Sci...336..853C }}&lt;/ref&gt; They postulated a cognitive-evolutionary account of human adaptation to social diversity that explains general resistance to multiculturalism, and offer a reorienting call for scholars and policy-makers who seek intervention-based solutions to the problem of prejudice.

==Reducing prejudice==

===The contact hypothesis===
The [[contact hypothesis]] predicts that prejudice can only be reduced when in-group and out-group members are brought together.&lt;ref name="Aronson, E. 2010"&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., &amp; Akert, R. M. (2010). ''Social Psychology'' (7th edition). New York: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, there are six conditions that must be met to reduce prejudice, as were cultivated in [[Elliot Aronson]]'s [[jigsaw (teaching technique)|"jigsaw" teaching technique]].&lt;ref name="Aronson, E. 2010"/&gt; First, the in- and out-groups must have a degree of mutual interdependence. Second, both groups need to share a common goal. Third, the two groups must have equal status. Fourth, there must be frequent opportunities for informal and interpersonal contact between groups. Fifth, there should be multiple contacts between the in- and the out-groups. Finally, [[social norm]]s of equality must exist and be present to foster prejudice reduction.

===Empirical research===
Academics Thomas Pettigrew and Linda Tropp conducted a [[meta-analysis]] of 515 studies involving a quarter of a million participants in 38 nations to examine how intergroup contact reduces prejudice. They found that three [[Mediation (statistics)|mediators]] are of particular importance: Intergroup contact reduces prejudice by (1) enhancing knowledge about the outgroup, (2) reducing anxiety about intergroup contact, and (3) increasing [[empathy]] and perspective-taking. While all three of these mediators had mediational effects, the mediational value of increased knowledge was less strong than anxiety reduction and empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Pettigrew |first1= Thomas F. |last2= Tropp |first2= Linda R. |year= 2008 |title= How does intergroup contact reduce prejudice? Meta-analytic tests of three mediators |journal= [[European Journal of Social Psychology]] |volume= 38 |issue= 6 |pages= 922–934 |publisher= |doi= 10.1002/ejsp.504 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some individuals confront discrimination when they see it happen, with research finding that individuals are more likely to confront when they perceive benefits to themselves, and are less likely to confront when concerned about others' reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Good | first1 = J. J. | last2 = Moss-Racusin | first2 = C. A. | last3 = Sanchez | first3 = D. T. | year = 2012 | title = When do we confront?

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report developed under the leadership of [[Ottmar Edenhofer]] evaluates the global potential for using [[renewable energy]] to [[Climate change mitigation|mitigate climate change]]. This IPCC special report provides broader coverage of renewable energy than was included in the IPCC’s 2007 climate change assessment report, as well as stronger [[renewable energy policy]] coverage.&lt;ref name=ren212011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |page=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy can contribute to "social and economic development, energy access, secure energy supply, climate change mitigation, and the reduction of negative environmental and health impacts". Under favourable circumstances, cost savings in comparison to non-renewable energy use exist.&lt;ref name="ipcc_sren"/&gt;

== History ==
Previously the IPCC examined both renewable energy and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in its [[fourth assessment report]], published in 2007, but members decided that [[renewable energy commercialization]] merits additional in-depth coverage because of its importance in reducing [[carbon emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/meetings/session28/doc3.pdf  Scoping Paper: IPCC Special Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The outline of the IPCC WG III’s Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) was approved at the IPCC Plenary in Budapest in April, 2008. The final report was approved at the 11th session of the IPCC Working Group III, May 2011, in Abu Dhabi. The SRREN addresses the information needs of policy makers, private sector and civil society in a comprehensive way and will provide valuable information for further IPCC publications, including the upcoming IPCC 5th Assessment Report.  The SRREN was released for publication on May 9, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/ Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Special Report "aims to provide a better understanding and broader information on the mitigation potential of renewable energy sources: technological feasibility, economic potential and market status, economic and environmental costs&amp;benefits, impacts on energy security, co-benefits in achieving sustainable development, opportunities and synergies, options and constraints for integration into the energy supply systems and in the societies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/activities/activities.htm IPCC Activities]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main findings==
Renewable energy can contribute to "social and economic development, energy access, secure energy supply, climate change mitigation, and the reduction of negative environmental and health impacts".&lt;ref name="ipcc_sren"/&gt;

In the report, the IPCC said "as infrastructure and energy systems develop, in spite of the complexities, there are few, if any, fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet a majority share of total energy demand in locations where suitable renewable resources exist or can be supplied".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |year=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, United States |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under favourable circumstances, cost savings in comparison to non-renewable energy use exist.&lt;ref name="ipcc_sren"/&gt; IPCC scenarios "generally indicate that growth in renewable energy will be widespread around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |year=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, United States |page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC said that if governments were supportive, and the full range of renewable technologies were deployed, renewable energy could account for almost 80% of the world's energy supply within four decades.&lt;ref name=ipccccc/&gt; [[Rajendra Pachauri]], chairman of the IPCC, said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1% of global GDP annually. This approach could keep greenhouse gas concentrations to less than 450 parts per million, the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible.&lt;ref name=ipccccc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/09/ipcc-renewable-energy-power-world |title=Renewable energy can power the world, says landmark IPCC study |author=Fiona Harvey |date=9 May 2011  |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Richards Heuer graduated in 1950 from [[Williams College]] with a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy. One year later, while a graduate student at the [[University of California in Berkeley]], future CIA Director [[Richard Helms]] recruited Heuer to work at the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt; Helms, also a graduate of Williams College, was looking for recent graduates to hire at CIA.&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt; Heuer spent the next 24 years working with the Directorate of Operations before switching to the Directorate of Intelligence in 1975. His interest in intelligence analysis and "how we know" was rekindled by the case of [[Yuri Nosenko]] and his studies in social science methodology while a master's student at the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt; Richards Heuer is well known for his analysis of the extremely controversial and disruptive case of Soviet KGB defector Yuri Nosenko, who was first judged to be part of a "master plot" for penetration of CIA but was later officially accepted as a legitimate defector. Heuer worked within the DI for four years, eventually retiring in 1979 after 28 years of service as the head of the methodology unit for the political analysis office. (Though retired from the DI in 1979, Heuer continued to work as a contractor on various projects until 1995.)&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt; He eventually received an M.A. in international relations from the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Heuer discovered his interest in cognitive psychology through reading the work of [[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky|Tversky]] subsequent to an [[International Studies Association]] (ISA) convention in 1977. His continuing interest in the field and its application to intelligence analysis led to several published works including papers, CIA training lectures and conference panels.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Heuer Jr. |first1=Richards J. |date=2009 |title=The Evolution of Structured Analytic Techniques |url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog885/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.geog885/files/file/Evolution_SAT_Heuer.pdf |website=e-education.psu.edu |accessdate=2018-09-10}} Presentation to the [[National Academy of Science]], [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] Committee on Behavioral and Social Science Research to Improve Intelligence Analysis for National Security, Washington, DC, December 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structured analytic techniques==
{{See also|Problem structuring methods}}
===''Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis'' and key concepts===
Heuer's book ''Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis'', published in 2010 (second edition 2015) and co-authored with Randy H. Pherson, provides a comprehensive taxonomy of structured analytic techniques (SATs) pertaining to eight categories: decomposition and visualization, idea generation, scenarios and indicators, hypothesis generation and testing, cause and effect, challenge analysis, conflict management and decision support.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The book details 50 SATs (55 in the second edition) in step-by-step processes that contextualize each technique for use within the intelligence community and business community. The book goes beyond simply categorizing the various techniques by accentuating that SATs are processes that foster effective collaboration among analysts.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Structured analytic techniques as process====
In light of the increasing need for interagency analyst collaboration,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Heuer Jr. |first1=Richards J. |date=2008 |title=Small Group Processes for Intelligence Analysis |website=pherson.org |url=http://www.pherson.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/02.-Small-Group-Processes.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020125056/http://www.pherson.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/02.-Small-Group-Processes.pdf |archivedate=2016-10-20 |accessdate=2018-09-10}} Prepared for the [[Sherman Kent School]], Central Intelligence Agency, 28 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Heuer and Pherson advocate SATs as "enablers" of collective and interdisciplinary intelligence products.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The book is a response to problems that arise in small group collaborative situations such as [[groupthink]], [[group polarization]] and premature consensus.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Heuer's previous insight into team dynamics advocates the use of analytic techniques such as [[Nominal Group Technique]] and Starbursting for idea generation and [[prediction markets]] for aggregating opinions in response to the identified problems.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The book proposes SATs as not only a means for guiding collection and analysis, but also a means for guiding group interaction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Recommendations to the Director of National Intelligence====
Heuer and Pherson assert that the [[National Intelligence Council]] (NIC) needs to serve as the entity that sets the standards for the use of structured analytic techniques within the intelligence community.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Director of National Intelligence]] (DNI) could accomplish this by creating a new position to oversee the use of SATs in all NIC projects. Further, Heuer and Pherson suggest that the DNI create a "center for analytic tradecraft" responsible for testing all structured analytic techniques, developing new structured analytic techniques and managing feedback and lessons learned regarding all structured analytic techniques throughout the intelligence community.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===''Psychology of Intelligence Analysis'' and key concepts===
Heuer's seminal work ''Psychology of Intelligence Analysis'' details his three fundamental points. First, human minds are ill-equipped ("poorly wired") to cope effectively with both inherent and induced uncertainty.&lt;ref name="PSY"&gt;{{cite book |last=Heuer |first=Richards J. |date=2001 |origyear=1999 |title=Psychology of Intelligence Analysis |edition=2nd |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Center for the Study of Intelligence, [[Central Intelligence Agency]] |isbn=1929667000 |oclc=53813306 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, increased knowledge of our inherent biases tends to be of little assistance to the analyst. And lastly, tools and techniques that apply higher levels of critical thinking can substantially improve analysis on complex problems.&lt;ref name="PSY"/&gt;

====Mental models and perceptions====
Mental models, or mind sets, are essentially the screens or lenses that people perceive information through.&lt;ref name="PSY"/&gt; Even though every analyst sees the same piece of information, it is interpreted differently due to a variety of factors (past experience, education, and cultural values to name merely a few).&lt;ref name="PSY"/&gt; In essence, one's perceptions are morphed by a variety of factors that are completely out of the control of the analyst. Heuer sees mental models as potentially good and bad for the analyst. On the positive side, they tend to simplify information for the sake of comprehension but they also obscure genuine clarity of interpretation.&lt;ref name="PSY"/&gt;

Therefore, since all people observe the same information with inherent and different biases, Heuer believes an effective analysis system needs a few safeguards. It should: encourage products that clearly show their assumptions and chains of inferences; and it should emphasize procedures that expose alternative points of view.&lt;ref name="PSY"/&gt; What is required of analysts is "a commitment to ''challenge, refine, and challenge again'' their own working mental models."&lt;ref name="PSY"/&gt; This is a key component of his [[analysis of competing hypotheses]]; by delineating all available hypotheses and refuting the least likely ones, the most likely hypothesis becomes clearer.

====Recommendations====
Heuer offers several recommendations to the intelligence community for improving intelligence analysis and avoiding consistent pitfalls. First, an environment that not only promotes but rewards critical thinking is essential.&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt; Failure to challenge the first possible hypothesis simply because it sounds logical is unacceptable. Secondly, Heuer suggests that agencies expand funding for research on the role that cognitive processes play in decision making.&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt; With so much hanging on the failure of success of analytical judgments, he reasons, intelligence agencies need to stay abreast of new discoveries in this field. Thirdly, agencies should promote the continued development of new tools for assessing information.&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt;

===Analysis of competing hypotheses===
{{Main|Analysis of competing hypotheses}}
"Analysis of competing hypotheses (ACH) is an analytic process that identifies a complete set of alternative hypotheses, systematically evaluates data that is consistent and inconsistent with each hypothesis, and rejects hypotheses that contain too much inconsistent data."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pherson.org/index.php/ach/|title=ACH: Analysis of Competing Hypotheses|website=pherson.org|publisher=Pherson Associates, LLC|accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACH is an eight step process to enhance analysis:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis of Competing Hypotheses: An Eight Step Process|url=http://www.pherson.org/PDFFiles/ACH-AnEightStepProcess.pdf|website=pherson.org|publisher=Pherson Associates, LLC|accessdate=2018-09-10}} A single-page document.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Identify all possible hypotheses
#Make a list of significant evidence and arguments
#Prepare a matrix to analyze the "diagnosticity" of evidence
#Drawn tentative conclusions
#Refine the matrix
#Compare your personal conclusions about the relative likelihood of each hypothesis with the inconsistency scores
#Report your conclusions
#Identify indicators

Heuer originally developed ACH to be included as the core element in an interagency deception analysis course during the Reagan administration in 1984 concentrated on Soviet deception regarding arms deals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC) in conjunction with Heuer developed the PARC ACH 2.0.5 software for use within the intelligence community in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.parc.com/istl/projects/ach/ach.html|title=ACH2.0 Download Page|website=parc.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180817031908/http://www2.parc.com/istl/projects/ach/ach.html|archivedate=2018-08-17|accessdate=2018-09-10}} See also: {{cite web|title=The Open Source Analysis of Competing Hypotheses Project|url=http://competinghypotheses.org/|website=competinghypotheses.org|accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in the Nosenko case==
During the 1980s, Richards Heuer was deeply involved in analyzing the controversial [[Yuri Nosenko]] case. His paper, ''Nosenko: Five Paths to Judgment'', was originally published in 1987 in the CIA's classified journal ''[[Studies in Intelligence]]'', where it remained classified for eight years. In 1995, it was then published in ''Inside CIA's Private World, Declassified Articles from the Agency's Internal Journal, 1955–1992''.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite book |last=Heuer Jr. |first=Richards J. |date=1987 |chapter=Nosenko: Five Paths to Judgment |editor-last=Westerfield |editor-first=H. Bradford |title=Inside CIA's Private World: Declassified Articles From the Agency's Internal Journal, 1955–1992 |pages=379–414 |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |jstor=10.2307/j.ctt5vm5td |isbn=0300060262 |oclc=31867339}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article is an explanation of how and why the errors associated with the Nosenko case occurred, and has been used for teaching deception analysis to analysts.

Heuer outlines five strategies for identifying truth in deception analysis cases, employing the Nosenko case as a use case throughout in order to demonstrate how analysts on the case failed to conclude that Nosenko was legitimate.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The five strategies presented in the article are:

#Motive approach: Identifying whether or not there is a motive for deception.
#Anomalies and inconsistencies approach: Searching for inconsistencies from or deviations the norm.
#Litmus test approach: Comparing the information from an unknown or new source with the information from a reliable or credible source.
#Cost accounting approach: Analyzing the opportunity cost for the enemy and the cost of conducting deception.
#Predictive test approach: Developing a tentative hypothesis and then comprehensively testing it.

Heuer states that though he was at one point a believer in "the master plot" (deep and pervasive penetration of the CIA by the Soviets) due to reasoning elaborated in the anomalies and inconsistencies approach and the motive approach, he came to discount this theory and to accept Yuri Nosenko as bona fide after exercising the predictive test approach and the cost accounting approach.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Heuer maintains that considering the master plot was not unwise as it was a theory that should have been discussed in light of the information available at the time.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The conclusion of the five strategies approach is that, as demonstrated by the Nosenko case, "all five approaches are useful for complete analysis" and that an analyst should not rely on one strategy alone.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Contributions in personnel security==
During his 20 years as a consultant for the Defense Personnel Security Research Center (PERSEREC), Richards Heuer developed two encyclopedic websites: the Adjudicative Desk Reference and Customizable Security Guide and the Automated Briefing System.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhra.mil/perserec/products.html|title=PERSEREC|website=dhra.mil|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315225147/http://www.dhra.mil/perserec/products.html|archivedate=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are free to use and available in the public domain for download.

===Adjudicative desk reference===
This large database supplements the Intelligence Community Adjudicative Guidelines which specify 13 categories of behavior that must be considered before granting a security clearance. Heuer's product provides far more detailed information about why these behaviors are a potential security concern and how to evaluate their severity. Though this background information is not official government policy, the reference has been approved by the Security Agency Executive Advisory Committee as a tool for assisting security investigators and managers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Appeals panels and lawyers have used it to deal with security clearance decisions, and it has also been proven useful to employee assistance counselors.

===Online guide to security responsibilities===
This tool provides an all-in-one source for introducing new personnel to all the various intricacies of security. Additionally, it provides a wealth of information for security professionals seeking to prepare awareness articles or briefings. The software covers a variety of topics including (but not limited to): protecting classified information, foreign espionage threats and methods, and computer vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is an updated version of the Customizable Security Guide. In hard copy format, there are over 500 pages of material.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Self-acceptance''' is acceptance of self.

==Definition==
Self-acceptance can be defined as:
* the awareness of one's strengths and weaknesses,
* the realistic (yet subjective) appraisal of one's talents, capabilities, and general worth, and,
* feelings of satisfaction with one's self despite deficiencies and regardless of past behaviors and choices.&lt;ref name=Henriques&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henriques|first1=Gregg|title=Six Domains of Psychological Well-being|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/theory-knowledge/201405/six-domains-psychological-well-being|website=Psychology Today|publisher=Sussex Publishers|accessdate=12 August 2015|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shepard&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shepard|first1=Lorrie A.|title=Self-Acceptance: The Evaluative Component of the Self-Concept Construct|journal=American Educational Research Journal|date=1978|volume=16|issue=2|pages=139|doi=10.2307/1162326}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vlahopoulos&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vlahopoulos|first1=Basil Alex|title=The Relationships between Psychological Well-being, Self-acceptance, Client Status, and Counselor Facilitative Behaviors|date=1985|publisher=University of Cincinnati|location=Cincinnati, Ohio|pages=5 &amp; 28|accessdate=12 August 2015|chapter=Introduction and Review of the Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shepard (1979), self-acceptance is an individual's satisfaction or happiness with oneself, and is thought to be necessary for good [[mental health]]. Self-acceptance involves self-understanding, a realistic, albeit subjective, awareness of one's strengths and weaknesses. It results in an individual's feeling about oneself, that they are of "unique worth".

In [[clinical psychology]] and [[positive psychology]], self-acceptance is considered the prerequisite for change to occur. It can be achieved by stopping criticizing and solving the defects of one's self, and then accepting them to be existing within one's self. That is, tolerating oneself to be imperfect in some parts.

Some distinguish between ''conditional'' and ''unconditional'' self-acceptance.&lt;ref name="Bernard2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael E. Bernard|title=The Strength of Self-Acceptance: Theory, Practice and Research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rPa6BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR15|date=8 July 2014|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-6806-6|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-acceptance is one of the six factors in Carol D. Ryff's structure for eudaimonic well-being.

==Qualities==
A person who scores high on self-acceptance:
* has a positive self-attitude, 
* acknowledges and accepts all aspects of themselves (including the good and bad), 
* is not self-critical or confused about their identity, and,
* does not wish they were any different from who they already are.&lt;ref name=Henriques /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ryff&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryff|first1=Carol D.|last2=Singer|first2=Burton H.|title=Know Thyself and Become What You Are: A Eudaimonic Approach to Psychological Well-Being|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=5 October 2006|volume=9|issue=1|pages=13–39|doi=10.1007/s10902-006-9019-0}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Past and current views in psychology==

In the past, the practice of self-acceptance was reproved by the Greeks. However, the need to know about and understand “the self” eventually became an important, underlying point in several psychological theories, such as:
* [[Marie Jahoda|Jahoda]]'s work on mental health, 
* [[Carl Rogers]]' Theory of Personality, 
* [[Gordon Allport]]'s Eight Stages of Self (Proprium) Development, and,
* [[Abraham Maslow|Maslow]]'s Hierarchy of Needs under the “self-actualization” category.&lt;ref name=Ryff /&gt;

In addition to that, the life-span theories of [[Erik Erikson|Erikson]] and [[Bernice Neugarten|Neugarten]] mention the importance of self-acceptance including one's past life, and [[Carl Jung]]'s process of individuation also emphasizes coming to terms with the dark side of one's self, or "the shadow".&lt;ref name=Ryff /&gt;

==Relation to positive psychology==

With respect to [[positive psychology]], self-acceptance, as a component of eudaimonic well-being (EWB), is an indicator and a measure of [[psychological well-being]].&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Richard M.|last2=Huta|first2=Veronika|last3=Deci|first3=Edward L.|title=Living well: a self-determination theory perspective on eudaimonia|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|date=29 September 2006|volume=9|issue=1|pages=139–170|doi=10.1007/s10902-006-9023-4}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sin|first1=Nancy L.|last2=Lyubomirsky|first2=Sonja|title=Enhancing well-being and alleviating depressive symptoms with positive psychology interventions: a practice-friendly meta-analysis|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|date=May 2009|volume=65|issue=5|pages=467–487|doi=10.1002/jclp.20593|pmid=19301241}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Alfred Adler]], founder of individual psychology, observed that people who thought of themselves as inferior also observed a depreciation of others.&lt;ref name=Vlahopoulos /&gt;

==Psychological benefits==

Some psychological benefits of self-acceptance include mood regulation, a decrease in depressive symptoms, and an increase in positive emotions.&lt;ref name=Jimenez&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jimenez|first1=Sherlyn S.|last2=Niles|first2=Barbara L.|last3=Park|first3=Crystal L.|title=A mindfulness model of affect regulation and depressive symptoms: Positive emotions, mood regulation expectancies, and self-acceptance as regulatory mechanisms|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=October 2010|volume=49|issue=6|pages=645–650|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.05.041}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
An example of this can be seen in a 2014 study that looked at affective profiles. The results yielded suggest that individuals categorized as self-fulfilling (as compared to the other profiles) tended to score higher on all the factors of Ryff's eudaimonic well-being dimensions (self-acceptance included).&lt;ref name=Garcia&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garcia|first1=Danilo|last2=Al Nima|first2=Ali|last3=Kjell|first3=Oscar N.E.|title=The affective profiles, psychological well-being, and harmony: environmental mastery and self-acceptance predict the sense of a harmonious life|journal=PeerJ|date=13 February 2014|volume=2|pages=e259|doi=10.7717/peerj.259|pmid=24688843|pmc=3933359}}&lt;!--|accessdate=12 August 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition to that, self-acceptance (and environmental mastery) specifically and significantly predicted harmony in life across all affective profiles.&lt;ref name=Garcia /&gt;

Other psychological benefits include:
* a heightened sense of freedom, 
* a decrease in fear of failure, 
* an increase in self-worth, 
* an increase in independence (autonomy),
* an increase in self-esteem, 
* less desire to win the approval of others,
* less self-critique and more self-kindness when mistakes occur, 
* more desire to live life for one's self (and not others), and,
* the ability to take more risks without worrying about the consequences.&lt;ref name=McQuillan&gt;{{cite web|last1=McQuillan|first1=Susan|title=Radiate Self-Acceptance|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/cravings/201409/radiate-self-acceptance|website=Psychology Today|publisher=Sussex Publishers|accessdate=12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-acceptance is also thought to be necessary for good mental health.&lt;ref name=Shepard /&gt;

==Physical benefits==

In addition to psychological benefits, self-acceptance may have physical benefits as well.&lt;ref name=Ryan /&gt; For example, the results of a 2008 study propose that older women with higher levels of environmental mastery, positive relations with others, and self-acceptance showed lower levels of glycosylated hemoglobin, which is a marker for glucose levels/insulin resistance.&lt;ref name=Ryff /&gt;

The term '''sense of place''' has been used in many different ways. It is a characteristic that some geographic [[Location (geography)|places]] have and some do not,&lt;ref name="Yi-Fu"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tuan|first1=Yi-Fu|title=Space and place: The perspective of experience|date=1977|publisher=University of Minnesota press|location=Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; while to others it is a feeling or perception held by people (not by the place itself).&lt;ref name="Agnew"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agnew|first1=J.A.|last2=Duncan|first2=J.S.|title=The power of place: Bringing together geographical and sociological imaginations|date=1989|publisher=Unwin Hyman Publishers|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Altman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Altman, ed.|first1=I.|last2=Low, ed.|first2=S.M.|title=Place attachment.

''Landscapes of Fear''. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some students and educators engage in "[[place-based education]]" in order to improve their "sense(s) of place," as well as to use various aspects of place as educational tools in general.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D. 2013.

==Geographic place==

[[Cultural geography|Cultural geographers]], [[anthropologists]], [[sociologists]] and [[urban planners]] study why certain places hold special meaning to particular people or animals.&lt;ref name="Spretnak"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spretnak|first1=C.|title=The resurgence of the real: Body, nature and place in a hypermodern world|date=1997|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishers|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Places said to have a strong "sense of place" have a strong [[identity (social science)|identity]]  that is deeply felt by inhabitants and visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=W.|title=Personal identity, national identity and international relations|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=J.|last2=Massey|first2=D.|last3=Cochrane|first3=A.|title=Rethinking the Region|date=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sense of place is a social [[phenomenon]].&lt;ref name="Agnew 2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Agnew|first1=J.|title=Making political geography|date=2002|publisher=Arnold Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Codes aimed at protecting, preserving and enhancing places felt to be of value include "[[World Heritage Site]]" designations, the British "[[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]" controls and the American "[[National Historic Landmark]]" designation.

==Placelessness==

Places that lack a "sense of place" are sometimes referred to as "placeless" or "inauthentic”;cultural geographer, Edward Relph investigates the "placelessness" of these locations&lt;ref&gt;Relph, Edward, Place and Placelessness&lt;/ref&gt; anthropologist [[Marc Augé]] calls these "non-places."&lt;ref name="Augé"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Augé|first1=Marc|title=Non-Places: Introduction to an Anthropology of Supermodernity|date=1995|publisher=Verson Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stepping against the kind of reductive thinking that placelessness can lead to, in his book, The Practice of Everyday Life, Jesuit philosopher [[Michel de Certeau]] argues that another way of seeing placelessness is to see it as space. For de Certeau,"space is merely composed of intersections of mobile elements" that are not in stasis (117). Place, on the other hand, is space that has been ordered in some way to serve some human need"(117). A park, for instance, is a place that has been constructed "in accord with which elements are distributed in relationships of coexistence"(117) and therefore "implies an indication of stability"(117). de Certeau's ideas became instrumental in understanding the intersections of power and social relations in the construction of place. For de Certeau, placelessness, or "space" was a site for freedom or at least it is the site for what Timotheus Vermeulen sees as "potentially anarchic movement"&lt;ref&gt;https://frieze.com/article/space-place&lt;/ref&gt;    Outside of de Certeau's ideas, Placeless landscapes are seen as those that have no special relationship to the places in which they are located—they could be anywhere; roadside strip [[shopping mall]]s, [[filling stations|gas/petrol stations]] and [[convenience store]]s, [[fast food]] chains, and chain [[department store]]s have been cited as examples of placeless landscape elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Mike|title=City of Quartz: Excavating the Future in Los Angeles|date=1990|publisher=Vintage Press, Penquin Books|location=New York|isbn=9780679738060}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some historic sites or districts that have been heavily commercialized for [[tourism]] and new housing estates are defined as having lost their sense of place.&lt;ref name="Harvey 1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harvey|first1=D.C.|title=From space to place and back again: reflections on the condition of post modernity|date=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gertrude Stein]]'s "there is no there there" has been used as a description of such places.&lt;ref&gt;''Anyone's Autobiography'', 1937: see [[Gertrude Stein]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Human geographers and social psychologists have studied how a sense of place develops, including the importance of comparisons between places, learning from elders and observing natural disasters and other events.  Of particular note is the importance of childhood experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Measham TG (2006) Learning about environments: The significance of primal landscapes, Environmental Management 38(3), pp. 426–434&lt;/ref&gt;  Environmental psychologists have quantified links between exposure to natural environments in childhood and environmental preferences later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Bixler, R. D., M. F. Floyd, and W. E. Hammitt. (2002). Environmental socialization: Quantitative tests of the childhood play hypothesis, Environment and Behavior 34(6) pp. 795–818&lt;/ref&gt; Learning about surrounding environments during childhood is strongly influenced by the direct experience of playing, as well as through the role of family, culture, and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Derr | first1 = V | year = 2002 | title = Children's sense of place in northern New Mexico | url = | journal = Journal of Environmental Psychology | volume = 22 | issue = 1–2| pages = 125–137 | doi=10.1006/jevp.2002.0252}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The special bond which develops between children and their childhood environments has been called a "primal landscape" by human geographers.&lt;ref&gt;Gayton (1996) Landscapes of the Interior: Re-explorations of Nature and the Human Spirit. Gabriola Island, Canada: New Society Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; This childhood landscape forms part of an individual's identity and constitutes a key point of comparison for considering subsequent places later in life. As people move around as adults, they tend to consider new places in relation to this baseline landscape experienced during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Measham, TG (2007) Primal Landscapes: insights for education from empirical research on ways of learning about environments, International Research in Geographical and Environmental Education 16 (4) pp. 339–350&lt;/ref&gt; Sense of place is used as  a model for community-based psychosocial support programs.&lt;ref&gt;Prewitt Diaz, J.O. and Dayal, A.

A '''showmance''' (sometimes '''show-mance'''), also known as '''show romance''', is a [[romance (love)|romance]] that develops between two individuals in [[theater]], or on [[film]]s and [[television series]] and between [[reality show]] contestants or participants for the running period of the show. When the two actively engage in a "made up" situation, it can be called a '''fauxmance'''. It is also considered a [[neologism]] and its usage is gaining popularity in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/01/25/celebrity-big-brothers-cami-li-tells-calum-best-i-worship-the-ground-you-walk-on-as-perez-hilton-hits-out-at-showmance-5035762/ |title=Celebrity Big Brother 2015: Perez Hilton slams Cami Li Calum Best 'showmance' &amp;#124; Metro News |publisher=Metro.co.uk |date=2015-01-25 |accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/james-brinsford/cbb-perez-katie-hopkins_b_6569470.html |title=Is Katie Hopkins and Perez Hilton's Relationship the Showmance of 'Celebrity Big Brother'? &amp;#124; James Brinsford |publisher=Huffingtonpost.co.uk |date=2015-01-29 |accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term came to the attention of the mainstream on the non-scripted American television show ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' when it was first used by [[Will Kirby]] in 2001. It has been used in theater on stage for years. Then it moved to films, theater and scripted television,\ It is primarily entered into as a ploy to gain more public and media attention and, in case of television, more camera time during the run of a theater piece, or a television series. It may be also just a [[publicity stunt]]. Showmances during reality shows are often motivated by the participants' wanting viewers to vote to keep them in the show, so that they can see the 'romance' continue. In some competitive reality tv shows (Big Brother or Survivor), contestants often engaged in a showmance for strategic purposes. A showmance couple, by protecting each other and by voting together, maintain power over other contestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harley-Lewis |first=Colin |url=http://robhasawebsite.com/sabbermetrics-statistical-showmancing-part-1-big-brother-15-colin-harvey-lewis/|title=Sa[BB]ermetrics: Statistical Showmancing |publisher=robhasawebsite.com |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, when an amorous relationship actually does continue after the end of a show, many people would still allege that it is "just a show" the two are putting on.

Showmance is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''show'' and ''romance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/showmance |title=Definition of “showmance” |publisher=Collinsdictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/buzzword/entries/showmance.html |title=Definition of showmance, BuzzWord from |publisher=Macmillandictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a very few exceptions almost all showmance cases end as soon as the theater piece, or the television series or reality show is over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.reveal.co.uk/showbiz-celeb-gossip/news/a619907/cbbs-chloe-goodman-i-dont-want-a-showmance-in-the-house.html |title=CBB's Chloe Goodman: 'I don't want a showmance in the house!' - Celebrity News News |publisher=Reveal.co.uk |date=2015-01-07 |accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although mostly involving two persons, it may also possibly extend into a three-way showmance or foursome often accompanied with real or acted rivalries and jealousies. Although mostly the relations involve partners of the opposite sex, at times, showmances may involve same sex relations as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seals |first=Greg |url=http://www.dailydot.com/geek/big-brother-gay-romance-ignored/ |title=Is 'Big Brother' ignoring a budding gay showmance? |publisher=Dailydot.com |date=2015-03-10 |accessdate=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, a showmance occurs between two people playing lovers. The showmance could be caused because of the close contact between the actors in such situations, or because of a confusion between real emotions and the character's emotions.

The term has however moved to broader general use, describing any "contrived romance", also known as a relationship between two people, when either or both "act out" or fake being in love without meaning it, or in many cases with ulterior motives, like benefiting from the other party or misusing and abusing their feelings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="985">'''Site-based conservation''' is an approach to [[nature conservation]] that relies on the designation of important or representative examples of sites supporting key habitats or species, such as [[Key Biodiversity Areas]] (KBAs) or [[Important Bird Area]]s (IBAs). Whilst a rational way of ensuring that the very best resources are protected, it is open to a number of criticisms:
* It tends to focus resources and protection on only the best sites.
* With a changing climate, the best sites now may not be the best ones to protect for the future.
* Wildlife is ignorant of lines drawn on maps by humans.
On balance, site-based conservation is an essential part of nature conservation, along with initiatives such as environmental subsidies and planning controls that protect biodiversity across the whole landscape (the broad and shallow approach), and the more holistic ideas of [[landscape-scale conservation]].

In [[statistics]] and [[image processing]], to '''smooth''' a [[data set]] is to create an approximating [[function (mathematics)|function]] that attempts to capture important [[pattern]]s in the data, while leaving out [[noise]] or other fine-scale structures/rapid phenomena. In smoothing, the data points of a signal are modified so individual points (presumably because of noise) are reduced, and points that are lower than the adjacent points are increased leading to a smoother signal. Smoothing may be used in two important ways that can aid in data analysis (1) by being able to extract more information from the data as long as the assumption of smoothing is reasonable and (2) by being able to provide analyses that are both flexible and robust.&lt;ref&gt;Simonoff, Jeffrey S. (1998) ''Smoothing Methods in Statistics'', 2nd edition. Springer {{ISBN|978-0387947167}} {{page needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many different [[algorithm]]s are used in smoothing.

Smoothing may be distinguished from the related and partially overlapping concept of [[curve fitting]] in the following ways:
* curve fitting often involves the use of an explicit function form for the result, whereas the immediate results from smoothing are the "smoothed" values with no later use made of a functional form if there is one;
* the aim of smoothing is to give a general idea of relatively slow changes of value with little attention paid to the close matching of data values, while curve fitting concentrates on achieving as close a match as possible.
* smoothing methods often have an associated tuning parameter which is used to control the extent of smoothing. Curve fitting will adjust any number of parameters of the function to obtain the 'best' fit.
However, the terminology used across applications is mixed. For example, use of an [[Spline (mathematics)|interpolating spline]] fits a smooth curve exactly through the given data points and is sometimes called "smoothing".{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

==Linear smoothers==
In the case that the smoothed values can be written as a [[linear transformation]] of the observed values, the smoothing operation is known as a '''linear smoother'''; the matrix representing the transformation is known as a '''smoother matrix''' or [[hat matrix]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The operation of applying such a matrix transformation is called [[convolution]]. Thus the matrix is also called convolution matrix or a [[convolution kernel]]. In the case of simple series of data points (rather than a multi-dimensional image), the convolution kernel is a one-dimensional [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]].

==Algorithms==
One of the most common algorithms is the "[[Moving average (finance)|moving average]]", often used to try to capture important trends in repeated [[statistical survey]]s. In [[image processing]] and [[computer vision]], smoothing ideas are used in [[scale space]] representations. The simplest smoothing algorithm is the "rectangular" or "unweighted sliding-average smooth". This method replaces each point in the signal with the average of "m" adjacent points, where "m" is a positive integer called the "smooth width". Usually m is an odd number. The ''triangular smooth'' is like the ''rectangular smooth'' except that it implements a weighted smoothing function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Haver|first= T.|date=January 2012 |title=Smoothing|url=http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~toh/spectrum/Smoothing.html|work=terpconnect.umd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It says that the concept of Social Nature was created by [[Critical geography|critical geographers]] and embraces the idea of a [[socialize]]d [[nature]]. Critical geographers like [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] and [[Neil Smith (geographer)|Neil Smith]] "insisted that nature is social in three related ways":&lt;ref&gt;CASTREE, Noel and BRAUN, Bruce (Eds.), ''Social nature: theory, practice and politics'', Oxford: Blackwell, 2001, pp.10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Knowledge "of nature is invariably inflected with the biases of the" knowers,
*"Though knowledges of nature are social through and through, the social dimensions of nature are not reducible to knowledge alone",
*Societies "''physically reconstitute'' nature, both intentionally and unintentionally", to the point of internalizing nature into social processes (particularly in advanced Western societies).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5851">In [[mathematical logic]], a [[logical system]] has the '''soundness property''' [[if and only if]] every [[formula (mathematical logic)|formula]] that can be proved in the system is logically valid with respect to the [[Formal semantics (logic)|semantics]] of the system.

The [[Converse (logic)#Categorical converse|converse]] of soundness is known as [[Completeness (logic)|completeness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/ProofSystems.pdf |title=Types of proof system |last=Smith |first=Peter |date=2010 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, this comes down to its rules having the property of ''preserving [[truth]]''.

== Definition ==
A system with syntactic [[Logical consequence#Syntactic consequence|entailment]] &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; and [[Logical consequence#Semantic consequence|semantic entailment]] &lt;math&gt;\models&lt;/math&gt; is '''sound''' if for any [[sequence]] &lt;math&gt;A_1, A_2, ..., A_n&lt;/math&gt; of [[Sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] in its language, if &lt;math&gt;A_1, A_2, ..., A_n\vdash C&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A_1, A_2, ..., A_n\models C&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, a system is sound when all of its [[Theorem|theorems]] are [[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]].

== Logical systems ==

Soundness is among the most fundamental properties of mathematical logic. The soundness property provides the initial reason for counting a logical system as desirable. The [[completeness (logic)|completeness]] property means that every validity (truth) is provable. Together they imply that all and only validities are provable.

Most proofs of soundness are trivial.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} For example, in an [[axiomatic system]], proof of soundness amounts to verifying the validity of the axioms and that the rules of inference preserve validity (or the weaker property, truth). Most axiomatic systems have only the rule of [[modus ponens]] (and sometimes substitution),{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} so it requires only verifying the validity of the axioms and one rule of inference.

Soundness properties come in two main varieties: weak and strong soundness, of which the former is a restricted form of the latter.

===Soundness===

Soundness of a [[deductive system]] is the property that any sentence that is provable in that deductive system is also true on all interpretations or structures of the semantic theory for the language upon which that theory is based. In symbols, where ''S'' is the deductive system, ''L'' the language together with its semantic theory, and ''P'' a sentence of ''L'': if ⊢&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''P'', then also ⊨&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''P''.

===Strong soundness===

Strong soundness of a deductive system is the property that any sentence ''P'' of the language upon which the deductive system is based that is derivable from a set Γ of sentences of that language is also a [[logical consequence]] of that set, in the sense that any model that makes all members of Γ true will also make ''P'' true. In symbols where Γ is a set of sentences of ''L'': if Γ&amp;nbsp;⊢&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''P'', then also Γ&amp;nbsp;⊨&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''P''. Notice that in the statement of strong soundness, when Γ is empty, we have the statement of weak soundness.

===Arithmetic soundness===

If ''T'' is a theory whose objects of discourse can be interpreted as [[natural numbers]], we say ''T'' is ''arithmetically sound'' if all theorems of ''T'' are actually true about the standard mathematical integers.  For further information, see [[ω-consistent theory]].

==Relation to completeness==

The converse of the soundness property is the semantic [[Completeness (logic)|completeness]] property. A deductive system with a semantic theory is strongly complete if every sentence ''P'' that is a [[semantic consequence]] of a set of sentences Γ can be derived in the [[deduction system]] from that set. In symbols: whenever {{nowrap|Γ &lt;big&gt;⊨&lt;/big&gt; ''P''}}, then also {{nowrap|Γ &lt;big&gt;⊢&lt;/big&gt; ''P''}}. Completeness of [[first-order logic]] was first [[Gödel's completeness theorem|explicitly established]] by [[Gödel]], though some of the main results were contained in earlier work of [[Skolem]].

Informally, a soundness theorem for a deductive system expresses that all provable sentences are true. Completeness states that all true sentences are provable.

[[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]] shows that for languages sufficient for doing a certain amount of arithmetic, there can be no effective deductive system that is complete with respect to the intended interpretation of the symbolism of that language. Thus, not all sound deductive systems are complete in this special sense of completeness, in which the class of models (up to [[isomorphism]]) is restricted to the intended one. The original completeness proof applies to ''all'' classical models, not some special proper subclass of intended ones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9110">The '''Strehl ratio''' is a measure of the quality of optical [[image formation]], originally proposed by [[Karl Strehl]], after whom the term is named.&lt;ref&gt;Strehl, K. 1895, ''Aplanatische und fehlerhafte Abbildung im Fernrohr'', '''Zeitschrift für Instrumentenkunde''' 15 (Oct.), 362-370.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Strehl, K. 1902, ''Über Luftschlieren und Zonenfehler'', '''Zeitschrift für Instrumentenkunde''', 22 (July), 213-217. [http://www.slideshare.net/mikhailkonnik/strehl-1902 &amp;#91;PDF file&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt; Used variously in situations where optical resolution is compromised due to lens [[Optical aberration|aberration]]s or due to imaging through the [[Astronomical seeing|turbulent atmosphere]], the Strehl ratio has a value between 0 and 1, with a hypothetical, perfectly unaberrated optical system having a Strehl ratio of 1.

==Mathematical definition==
The Strehl ratio &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is frequently defined&lt;ref name="Saeak1"&gt;{{Citation| last = Sacek| first = Vladimir| title = 6.5. Strehl ratio| work = Notes on amateur telescope optics| date = July 14, 2006| url = http://www.telescope-optics.net/Strehl.htm| accessdate = March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the ratio of the peak aberrated image [[Irradiance|intensity]] from a [[point source]] compared to the maximum attainable intensity using an ideal optical system limited only by [[diffraction]] over the system's [[aperture]]. It is also often expressed in terms not of the peak intensity but the intensity at the image center (intersection of the optical axis with the focal plane) due to an on-axis source; in most important cases these definitions result in a very similar figure (or identical figure, when the point of peak intensity must be exactly at the center due to symmetry). Using the latter definition, the Strehl ratio &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; can be computed in terms of &lt;math&gt;\delta(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;, the offset of the [[wavefront]] due to an on-axis point source, compared to that produced by an ideal focusing system over the [[aperture]] A(x,y). Using [[Fraunhofer diffraction]] theory, one computes the wave amplitude using the [[Fourier transform]] of the aberrated pupil function evaluated at 0,0 (center of the image plane) where the phase factors of the [[Fraunhofer diffraction (mathematics)#Cartesian co-ordinates|Fourier transform formula]] are reduced to unity. Since the Strehl ratio refers to intensity, it is found from the squared [[Absolute value#Complex numbers|magnitude]] of that amplitude:
:&lt;math&gt;S = |\langle e^{i\phi} \rangle|^2
 = |\langle e^{i2\pi\delta/\lambda} \rangle|^2&lt;/math&gt;
where ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]], &lt;math&gt;\phi =2\pi\delta/\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[phase (waves)|phase]] error over the aperture at wavelength λ, and the average of the complex quantity inside the brackets is taken over the aperture A(x,y).

The Strehl ratio can be estimated using only the [[statistic]]s of the phase deviation 
&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, according to a formula rediscovered by Mahajan&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Mahajan | first = Virendra | title = Strehl ratio for primary aberrations in terms of their aberration variance | journal = J. Opt. Soc. Am. | volume = 73 | issue = 6 | pages = 860–861 | date = 1983 | url = http://www.opticsinfobase.org/josa/abstract.cfm?uri=josa-73-6-860 | doi = 10.1364/JOSA.73.000860 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/entities/calculators/Strehl_ratio_formula/av/uo/vo/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718080036/http://www.wolframalpha.com/entities/calculators/Strehl_ratio_formula/av/uo/vo/ |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }} Strehl ratio formula&lt;/ref&gt; but known long before in antenna theory as the [[Ruze's Equation|Ruze formula]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tmo.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-88/88E.PDF|title=Statistical Analysis of the 70 Meter Antenna Surface Distortions|first1=K.|last1=Kiedron|first2=C.

:&lt;math&gt;S \approx {e^{-\sigma^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
where sigma (σ) is the [[root mean square deviation]] over the aperture of the wavefront phase:
&lt;math&gt;\sigma^2 = \langle (\phi - \bar\phi)^2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

==The Airy disk==

 }}
Due to [[diffraction]], even a focusing system which is perfect according to [[geometrical optics]] will have a limited spatial [[Image resolution#Spatial resolution|resolution]]. In the usual case of a uniform circular aperture, the [[point spread function]] (PSF) which describes the image formed from an object with no spatial extent (a "point source"), is given by the [[Airy disk]] as illustrated here. For a circular aperture, the peak [[Irradiance|intensity]] found at the center of the Airy disk defines the point source image intensity required for a Strehl ratio of unity. An imperfect optical system using the same physical aperture will generally produce a broader PSF in which the peak intensity is reduced according to the factor given by the Strehl ratio. An optical system with only minor imperfections in this sense may be referred to as "diffraction limited" as its PSF closely resembles the Airy disk; a Strehl ratio of greater than .8 is frequently cited as a criterion for the use of that designation.

Note that for a given aperture the size of the Airy disk grows linearly with the wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and consequently the peak intensity falls according to &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; so that the reference point for unity Strehl ratio is changed. Typically, as wavelength is increased, an imperfect optical system will have a broader PSF with a decreased peak intensity. However the peak intensity of the reference Airy disk would have decreased even more at that longer wavelength, resulting in a ''better'' Strehl ratio at longer wavelengths (typically) even though the actual image resolution is poorer.

==Usage==
The ratio is commonly used to assess the quality of [[astronomical seeing]] in the presence of [[atmospheric turbulence]] and assess the performance of any [[adaptive optics|adaptive optical]] correction system. It is also used for the selection of short exposure images in the [[lucky imaging]]
method.

In industry, the Strehl ratio has become a popular way to summarize the performance of an optical design because it gives the performance of a real system, of finite cost and complexity, relative to a theoretically perfect system, which would be infinitely expensive and complex to build and would still have a finite point spread function. It provides a simple method to decide whether a system with a Strehl ratio of, for example, 0.95 is good enough, or whether twice as much should be spent to try to get a Strehl ratio of perhaps 0.97 or 0.98.

==Limitations==
Characterizing the form of the point-spread function by a single number, as the Strehl Ratio does, will be meaningful and sensible only if the point-spread function is little distorted from its ideal (aberration-free) form, which will be true for a well-corrected system that operates close to the diffraction limit. That includes most telescopes and [[microscope]]s, but excludes most photographic systems, for example. The Strehl ratio has been linked via the work of [[André Maréchal]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Etude des effets combinés de la diffraction et des aberrations géométriques sur l’image d’un point lumineux | author=Maréchal André | journal=Rev. Opt. | year=1947 | volume=2 | pages=257–277}}&lt;/ref&gt; to an aberration tolerancing theory which is very useful to designers of well-corrected optical systems, allowing a meaningful link between the aberrations of [[geometrical optics]] and the diffraction theory of physical optics. A significant shortcoming of the Strehl ratio as a method of image assessment is that, although it is relatively easy to calculate for an optical design prescription on paper, it is normally difficult to measure for a real optical system, not least because the theoretical maximum peak intensity is not readily available.

'''Structural information theory''' ('''SIT''') is a theory about [[perception|human perception]] and in particular about visual perceptual organization, which is the neuro-cognitive process that enables us to perceive scenes as structured wholes consisting of objects arranged in space. It has been applied to a wide range of research topics,&lt;ref&gt;Leeuwenberg, E. L. J. &amp; van der Helm, P. A. (2013). ''Structural information theory: The simplicity of visual form''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; mostly in visual form perception but also in, for instance, visual ergonomics, [[data visualization]], and [[music perception]].

SIT began as a quantitative model of visual [[pattern classification]]. Nowadays, it includes quantitative models of [[symmetry|symmetry perception]] and [[amodal perception|amodal completion]], and is theoretically sustained by a perceptually adequate formalization of visual regularity, a quantitative account of viewpoint dependencies, and a powerful form of neurocomputation.&lt;ref&gt;van der Helm, P. A. (2014). ''Simplicity in vision: A multidisciplinary account of perceptual organization''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; SIT has been argued to be the best defined and most successful extension of [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt ideas]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, S. E. (1999).  ''Vision science: Photons to phenomenology.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only Gestalt approach providing a [[calculus|formal calculus]] that generates plausible [[percept|perceptual interpretations]].

== The simplicity principle ==

Although visual stimuli are fundamentally multi-interpretable, the human visual system usually has a clear preference for only one interpretation. To explain this preference, SIT introduced a formal coding model starting from the assumption that the perceptually preferred interpretation of a stimulus is the one with the [[simplicity|simplest code]]. A simplest code is a code with minimum information load, that is, a code that enables a reconstruction of the stimulus using a minimum number of descriptive parameters. Such a code is obtained by capturing a maximum amount of visual regularity and yields a hierarchical organization of the stimulus in terms of wholes and parts.

The assumption that the visual system prefers simplest interpretations is called the simplicity principle.&lt;ref&gt;Hochberg, J. E., &amp; McAlister, E. (1953). A quantitative approach to figural "goodness". ''Journal of Experimental Psychology, 46,'' 361—364.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the simplicity principle is an information-theoretical translation of the Gestalt law of Prägnanz,&lt;ref&gt;Koffka, K. (1935). ''Principles of gestalt psychology.'' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; which was inspired by the natural tendency of physical systems to settle into relatively stable states defined by a minimum of free-energy. Furthermore, just as the later-proposed [[Minimum description length|minimum description length principle]] in [[algorithmic information theory]] (AIT), a.k.a. the theory of [[Kolmogorov complexity]], it can be seen as a formalization of [[Occam's Razor]], according to which the simplest interpretation of data is the best one.

== Structural versus algorithmic information theory ==

Since the 1960s, SIT (in psychology) and AIT (in computer science) evolved independently as viable alternatives for [[Claude Shannon|Shannon's]] classical [[information theory]] which had been developed in communication theory.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, C. E. (1948). A mathematical theory of communication. ''Bell System Technical Journal, 27,'' 379-423, 623—656.&lt;/ref&gt; In Shannon's approach, things are assigned codes with lengths based on their probability in terms of frequencies of occurrence (as, e.g., in the [[Morse code]]). However, in many domains, including perception, such probabilities are hardly quantifiable, if at all. Both SIT and AIT circumvent this problem by turning to descriptive complexities of individual things.

Although SIT and AIT share many starting points and objectives, there are also several relevant differences:
* SIT makes the perceptually relevant distinction between structural and metrical information, whereas AIT does not.
* SIT encodes for a restricted set of perceptually relevant kinds of regularities, whereas AIT encodes for any imaginable regularity.
* In SIT, the relevant outcome of an encoding is a hierarchical organization, whereas in AIT, it is only a complexity value.

== Simplicity versus likelihood ==

In visual perception research, the simplicity principle contrasts with the [[Helmholtz]]ian likelihood principle,&lt;ref&gt;von Helmholtz, H. L. F. (1962). ''Treatise on Physiological Optics'' (J. P. C. Southall, Trans.). New York: Dover. (Original work published 1909)&lt;/ref&gt; which assumes that the preferred interpretation of a stimulus is the one most likely to be true in this world. As shown within a [[Bayes theorem|Bayesian framework]] and using AIT findings, the simplicity principle would imply that perceptual interpretations are fairly veridical (i.e., truthful) in many worlds rather than, as assumed by the likelihood principle, highly veridical in only one world.&lt;ref&gt;van der Helm, P. A. (2000). Simplicity versus likelihood in visual perception: From surprisals to precisals. ''Psychological Bulletin, 126,'' 770—800. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0033-2909.126.5.770 doi:10.1037//0033-2909.126.5.770].&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, whereas the likelihood principle suggests that the visual system is a special-purpose system (i.e., adapted to one specific world), the simplicity principle suggests that it is a general-purpose system (i.e., adaptive to many different worlds).

Crucial to the latter finding is the distinction between, and integration of, viewpoint-independent and viewpoint-dependent factors in vision, as proposed in SIT's empirically successful model of amodal completion.&lt;ref&gt;van Lier, R. J., van der Helm, P. A., &amp; Leeuwenberg, E. L. J. (1994). Integrating global and local aspects of visual occlusion. ''Perception, 23,'' 883—903. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1068/p230883 doi:10.1068/p230883].&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bayesian framework, these factors correspond to prior probabilities and conditional probabilities, respectively. In SIT's model, however, both factors are quantified in terms of complexities, that is, complexities of objects and of their spatial relationships, respectively. This approach is consistent with [[cognitive neuroscience|neuroscientific]] ideas about the distinction and interaction between the ventral ("what") and dorsal ("where") streams in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Ungerleider, L. G., &amp; Mishkin, M. (1982). Two cortical visual systems. In D. J. Ingle, M. A. Goodale, &amp; R. J. W. Mansfield (Eds.), ''Analysis of Visual Behavior'' (pp. 549—586). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Versus connectionism and dynamic systems theory ==

A representational theory like SIT seems opposite to [[dynamic systems theory]] (DST), while [[connectionism]] can be seen as something in between. That is, connectionism flirts with DST when it comes to the usage of [[differential equations]] and flirts with theories like SIT when it comes to the representation of information. In fact, the different operating bases of SIT, connectionism, and DST, correspond to what [[David Marr (neuroscientist)|Marr]] called the computational, the algorithmic, and the implementational levels of description, respectively. According to Marr, these levels of description are complementary rather than opposite, thus reflecting [[epistemological pluralism]].

What SIT, connectionism, and DST have in common is that they describe nonlinear system behavior, that is, a minor change in the input may yield a major change in the output. Their complementarity expresses itself in that they focus on different aspects:
* Whereas DST focuses primarily on how the state of a physical system as a whole (in this case, the [[brain]]) develops over time, both SIT and connectionism focus primarily on what a system does in terms of information processing (which, in this case, can be said to constitute [[Cognitive science|cognition]]) and both assume that this information processing relies on interactions between pieces of information in distributed representations, that is, in networks of connected pieces of information.
* Whereas connectionism focuses on concrete interaction mechanisms (i.c., activation spreading) in a prefixed network that is assumed to be suited for many inputs, SIT focuses on the nature of the outcome of interactions that are assumed to take place in transient, input-dependent, networks.

== Modeling principles ==

In SIT's formal coding model, candidate interpretations of a stimulus are represented by [[String (computer science)|symbol strings]], in which identical symbols refer to identical perceptual primitives (e.g., blobs or edges). Every substring of such a string represents a spatially contiguous part of an interpretation, so that the entire string can be read as a reconstruction recipe for the interpretation and, thereby, for the stimulus. These strings then are encoded (i.e., they are searched for visual regularities) to find the interpretation with the simplest code.

This encoding is performed by way of symbol manipulation, which, in psychology, has led to critical statements of the sort of "SIT assumes that the brain performs symbol manipulation". Such statements, however, fall in the same category as statements such as "physics assumes that nature applies formulas such as [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] ''E=mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] ''F=ma''" and "DST models assume that dynamic systems apply differential equations". That is, these statements ignore that the very concept of [[formal system|formalization]] means that potentially relevant things are represented by symbols—not as a goal in itself but as a means to capture potentially relevant relationships between these things.

== Visual regularity ==

To obtain simplest codes, SIT applies coding rules that capture the kinds of regularity called iteration, symmetry, and alternation. These have been shown to be the only regularities that satisfy the formal criteria of
(a) being holographic regularities that (b) allow for hierarchically transparent codes.&lt;ref&gt;van der Helm, P. A., &amp; Leeuwenberg, E. L. J. (1991). Accessibility, a criterion for regularity and hierarchy in visual pattern codes. ''Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 35,'' 151—213. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-2496%2891%2990025-O doi:10.1016/0022-2496%2891%2990025-O].&lt;/ref&gt;

A crucial difference with respect to the traditionally considered transformational formalization of visual regularity is that, holographically, mirror symmetry is composed of many relationships between symmetry pairs rather than one relationship between symmetry halves. Whereas the transformational characterization may be suited better for [[object recognition]], the holographic characterization seems more consistent with the buildup of mental representations in object perception.

The perceptual relevance of the criteria of holography and transparency has been verified in the holographic approach to visual regularity.&lt;ref&gt;van der Helm, P. A., &amp; Leeuwenberg, E. L. J. (1996). Goodness of visual regularities: A nontransformational approach. ''Psychological Review, 103,'' 429—456. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.429 doi:10.1037/0033-295X.103.3.429].&lt;/ref&gt; This approach provides an empirically successful model of the detectability of single and combined visual regularities, whether or not perturbed by noise. For instance, it explains that mirror symmetries and Glass pattens are about equally detectable and usually better detectable than repetitions. It also explains that the detectability of mirror symmetries and Glass pattens in the presence of noise follows a psychophysical law that improves on [[Weber–Fechner law|Weber's law]].&lt;ref&gt;van der Helm, P. A. (2010). Weber-Fechner behaviour in symmetry perception? ''Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics, 72'', 1854—1864. [https://dx.doi.org/10.3758/APP.72.7.1854 doi:10.3758/APP.72.7.1854.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable packaging is a relatively new addition to the environmental considerations for packaging (see [[Packaging and labeling]]).  It requires more analysis and documentation to look at the package design, choice of materials, processing, and life-cycle.  This is not just the vague "green movement" that many businesses and companies have been trying to include over the past years.   Companies implementing these eco-friendly actions are reducing their [[carbon footprint]], using more recycled materials and  reusing more package components.&lt;ref&gt;Amcor (2014). Sustainability Review 2014. (http://www.amcor.com/sustainability/). Retrieved 10 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  They often encourage suppliers, contract packagers, and distributors to do likewise.

For example, researchers at the [[Agricultural Research Service]] are looking into using dairy-based films as an alternative to petroleum-based packaging. [http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/pr/2010/100120.htm]  Instead of being made of [[synthetic polymers]], these dairy-based films would be composed of proteins such as [[casein]] and [[whey]], which are found in milk.  The films would be [[biodegradable]] and offer better oxygen barriers than synthetic, chemical-based films.  More research must be done to improve the water barrier quality of the dairy-based film, but advances in sustainable packaging are actively being pursued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Environmental marketing]] claims on packages need to be made (and read) with caution. Ambiguous [[greenwashing]] titles such as ''green packaging'' and  ''environmentally friendly'' can be confusing without specific definition. Some regulators, such as the US Federal Trade Commission, are providing guidance to packagers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/grnrule/guides980427.htm  |title=Environmental Claims |accessdate=17 November 2008 |work= |publisher= Federal Trade Commission|date=2008-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies have long been reusing and recycling packaging when economically viable. Using minimal packaging has also been a common goal to help reduce costs. Recent years have accelerated these efforts based on social movements, consumer pressure, and regulation. All phases of packaging, distribution, and logistics are included.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable packaging is no longer focused on just recycling. Just as packaging is not the only eco target, although it is still top of mind for many. Right or wrong, packaging is frequently scrutinized and used as the measure of a company's overall sustainability, even though it may contribute only a small percentage to the total eco impact compared to other things, such as transportation, and water and energy use.

==Criteria==

The criteria for ranking and comparing packaging based on their sustainability is an active area of development.  General guidance, metrics, checklists, and scorecards are being published by several groups.

Government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/partnerships/stewardship/products/packaging.htm|title=Packaging, Product Stewarship|accessdate=2008-12-18|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[standards organization]]s, consumers, retailers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://walmartstores.com/FactsNews/NewsRoom/6039.aspx |title=Wal-Mart Unveils Packaging Scorecard to Suppliers |accessdate=2008-04-29|date=  November 2, 2008 |publisher=Wal-Mart }}&lt;/ref&gt; and packagers are considering several types of criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Each organization words the goals and targets a little differently. In general, the broad goals of sustainable packaging are:
# Functional&lt;ref&gt;anon: "Packaging Matters", Institute of Packaging Professionals, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; – product protection, safety, regulatory compliance, etc.
# Cost effective – if it is too expensive, it is unlikely to be used
# Support long-term human and ecological health

Specific factors for [[sustainable design]] of packaging may include:
* Use of minimal materials –  reduced packaging, reduced layers of packaging, lower mass (product to packaging ratio), lower volume, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Jason DeRusha. "The Incredible Shrinking Package". 16 Jul 2007. WCCO.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Logistics]] efficiency (through complete life cycle) – cube utilization, tare weight, enablement of efficient transportation, etc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/smartway/transport/documents/faqs/partnership_overview.pdf|format=PDF|title=SmartWay Transport Partnerships|accessdate=2008-12-22|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Energy]] efficiency, total energy content and usage, use of [[renewable energy]], etc.
* [[Recycled]] content – as available and functional.  For [[food contact materials]], there are special safety considerations, particularly for use of recycled plastics and paper.  Regulations are published by each country or region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Benefits==
Some aspects of environmentally sound packaging are required by regulators while others are decisions made by each packager.  Investors, employees, management, and customers can influence corporate decisions and help set policies.  When investors seek to purchase stock, companies known for their positive environmental policy can be attractive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nef.org.uk/greencompany/benefits.htm Benefits For Being Green]&lt;/ref&gt;  Potential stockholders and investors see this as a solid decision: lower environmental risks lead to more capital at cheaper rates. Companies that highlight their environmental status to consumers, can boost sales as well as product reputation. Going green  is often a sound investment that can pay off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/aug2008/bs20080817_557068.htm?campaign_id=rss_null More Benefits For Green Companies]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Some alternative materials that are recycled/recyclable and/or less damaging to the environment can lead to companies incurring increased costs. Though this is common when any product begins to carry the true cost of its production (producer pays, producer responsibility laws, take-back laws). There may be an expensive and lengthy process before the new forms of packaging are deemed safe to the public, and approval may take up to two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn6207/is_20080916/ai_n28113730 Is Going Green Worth It]&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note here, that for most of the developed world, tightening legislation, and changes in major retailer demand (Walmart's Sustainable Packaging Scorecard for example) the question is no longer "if" products and packaging should become more sustainable, but how-to and how-soon to do it.&lt;ref name="Jedlicka" /&gt;

==Criticism==

Efforts toward “greener” packaging are supported in the sustainability community, however, these are often viewed only as incremental steps and not as an end.  Some picture a true sustainable [[steady state economy]] that may be very different from today's:  greatly reduced energy usage, minimal [[ecological footprint]],  fewer [[consumer packaged goods]],  [[local purchasing]]   with [[short food supply chains]], little [[processed foods]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Teaching-Family Model''' ('''TFM''') is a model of care for troubled youth used internationally in group homes ([[Residential Child Care Community|residential child care communities]], [[Residential treatment center|residential treatment centers]], etc.), schools, home-based treatment, and other youth and dependent adult care programs. It was developed in the 1960s through research at the University of Kansas. Researchers included [[Montrose Wolf]] (the inventor of [[child time-out|time-out]] as a learning tool to shape behavior) and [[Gary Timbers]]. The model has been replicated over 800 times, although not all of the replications have proven effective and successful.&lt;ref&gt;Fixsen, D.L.; Blasé, K.; Timbers, G.D. &amp; Wolf, M.M. (2007). In Search of Program Implementation: 792 Replications of the Teaching-Family Model. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 8(1), 96–114 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
This model of care is based on an "organized approach to providing humane, effective, and individualized services that are satisfactory to clients and consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Bernfeld, G.A.; Blase, K.A. &amp; Fixsen, D.L. (2006). Towards a Unified Perspective on Human Service Delivery Systems: Application of the Teaching-Family Model. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 7(2), 168–74 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; It is cost effective and replicable." (from Teaching-Family Association Website) The focus is using scientifically proven methods of [[behaviorism]] known as [[applied behavior analysis]] and sometimes known as [[behavior modification]] to teach and reinforce pro-social skills and allow the individual to maintain or advance in his or her environment.

Many programs across the U.S. use this model of care, including Certified sites such as [http://garfieldparkacademy.org/ Garfield Park Academy,] [http://www.thornwellhome.org/ Thornwell], [http://www.khds.org/ Kenosha Human Development Services, Inc.], [http://www.thechildrenshomecinti.org/ The Children's Home of Cincinnati][http://www.boysandgirlshome.org/ Virginia Home for Boys and Girls], [http://www.closertohome.com/ Closer To Home Calgary, Alberta, Canada], [http://www.iunch.org/ The Indiana United Methodist Children's Home], and [http://www.youthvillage.org/ Utah Youth Village]. Sites are either Accredited Agencies, Developing Agencies, or Supportive Teaching-Family Association member agencies. Developing agencies like Children's Village undergo extensive evaluation by a sponsoring agency or approved developer before becoming an accredited agency. Supportive agencies like [http://www.youthquestinc.org/ Youth Quest Inc.] may use the Teaching-Family Model but have not undergone evaluation due to company size or funding restrictions.     

The '''Teaching-Family Association''' (TFA) is an international organization founded in 1975 to promote this model of care. More information can be found on their website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2345">'''The Survival Lottery''' is a [[thought experiment]], proposed by the philosopher [[John Harris (bioethicist)|John Harris]]. The basis of the idea is to ask people to imagine if [[organ donation]] were expected to save more individuals than it would kill. Hypothetically all individuals are assigned a number and drawn out of ''lottery'' when a donation is needed, and are expected to give up their lives to allow two or more people to live.

==Arguments for==
The argument for '''the survival lottery''' can be as follows:
# Imagine that organ donation was perfect.
# There is no difference between killing and letting die.
# Given 1 and 2 we should adopt the Survival Lottery.

The article is a direct challenge to the belief that there is a difference between killing and letting die, and an exploration of the moral consequences that follow from this.


The utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill defends Harris's proposal and explains it using the three utilitarian principles: happiness, impartiality and consequences.

==Assumptions the "survival lottery" relies on==
The '''survival lottery''' relies on the following assumptions:

# Each life (killed or allowed to die naturally) is of equal value.
# Two lives saved are of more value than one life killed to save them.
# Two lives saved would be completely cured, or be sufficiently cured as to show a quality of two lives greater than a healthy life killed to save them.
# Two lives saved would be able to live long enough on the transplanted organs (staving off rejection and the original sickness causing their need for replacement) as to show a quantitative gain over a completely healthy (and presumable longer) life randomly chosen to be killed.

==Arguments Against==
One or more of these assumptions can be proven false and disarm the '''survival lottery''' thought experiment by proving that while killing and letting die can be determined as equal (hypothetically), the actual lives involved cannot be determined as equal, nor that multiple lives saved are greater than one life lost.

The field of [[rhetoric]] has been a matter of considerable debate for millennia. Derived from the Greek word for public speaking, rhetoric's original concern dealt primarily with the spoken word. [[Aristotle]] wrote a philosophical work that still has major scholarly impact, ''Rhetoric'', in which he identifies five [[wikt:canons|canons]] of the field of rhetoric: invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery. Invention is concerned with the content or idea being expressed, and relates to the rhetorician’s understanding of his goals. Arrangement deals with issues of how to best organize an argument in order to attain the speaker or writer’s goals. It is closely related to style, the third element, which relates to gestures, metaphors, and word choices selected to best influence the audience and reach the desired goal. Memory is the fourth and simplest element of rhetoric in being related specifically to spoken rhetoric, specifically concerned with remembering the words in one’s speech.  Finally, delivery concerns tone, word choice, posture and other such bodily signs that influence the effect of one’s words on an audience.

Rhetorical theory is the body of thought about human symbol use. The term rhetoric, in its popular usage,
typically has negative connotations. Rhetoric is contrasted with action; it is empty words, talk without
substance, mere ornament. This contemporary understanding of rhetoric is at odds with a long history of
rhetorical theory, dating back in the West to ancient Greece and Rome, that provides a long-standing foundation
on which the contemporary discipline of communication is built.

From 1870 to 1900, as the American [[college]] system moved from small schools to a larger, diverse set of universities with distinct academic disciplines, the field of [[composition studies]] grew from traditional rhetorical studies. As pioneers in the field of composition studies, [[Harvard University]] enacted a new program in their English department that, for the first time, made “a total commitment to writing,” though the initial focus was on personal writing and did not include rhetoric or literary analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Brereton, John C., ed. “Introduction.” ''The Origins of Composition Studies in the American College, 1875–1925: A Documentary History''. Pittsburgh: U of P Press, 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the field of composition studies soon became paired with the field of rhetoric as the modern [[university]] developed, because scholars began to realize that elements of rhetoric and not “systematic grammatical study” were necessary to improve writing and composition abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Winterowd, W. Ross. “Discovery- Invention- Creation.” ''The English Department: A Personal and Institutional History''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1998. 32–74. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; While rhetoric traditionally concerned matters related to verbal orations or speeches, both rhetoric and composition are related to the expression of ideas, often in an attempt to influence one’s audience. In addition, composition is also concerned with the principles of invention, arrangement, style, and delivery traditionally associated with rhetoric; even memory can become an element of composition when one is writing a speech or a scholarly paper to be delivered orally.  Thus, rhetoric and composition— colloquially termed “rhet/comp” or “comp/rhet”— became a field of its own and remains a burgeoning discipline in universities today.

==Current-traditional rhetoric==

The rhetoric and composition pedagogy developed in the late nineteenth century, and still used in many schools today, is known as current-traditional rhetoric, commonly referred to among field scholars, and hereinafter, as “CTR.” CTR is defined by an emphasis on the final product, usually the five-paragraph, informal essay or short research paper on an objective topic. In addition, CTR centers around the notion that discourse is delivered in a prescribed, mechanical form, leading to its pedagogical focus on grammar, spelling, syntax, and uniform style and arrangement. Further, CTR promotes the idea that the purpose of writing is the product, which is expected to reflect a predefined, stagnant reality without consideration for process, authorial identity, or audience. For example, a CTR pedagogue might instruct his or her students to write an essay on bicycles; the expected outcome is an objective discussion of bicycles organized in a five-paragraph essay, the identity of the audience or the writer is not to be considered, and the goal is the final product—the “essay”— which should have no errors (or even intentional boundary-breakers) in grammar, spelling, or design. James Berlin and Robert Inkster examine typical CTR textbooks and evaluate their limited approach to teaching composition, concluding that CTR limits “discovery procedures,” diminishes the “importance of the writer,” and restricts writer engagement with audience.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, James A., and Robert P. Inkster. “Current-Traditional Rhetoric: Paradigm and Practice.” ''Freshman English News'' 8.3 (1980): 1–14. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, W. Ross Winterowd similarly contends that the pedagogy of CTR is dated and ultimately ineffective in his examination of a number of current-traditional textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Winterowd, W. Ross. “Current-Traditional Textbooks: Take in Small Doses and Shake Well Before Using.” ''The English Department: A Personal and Institutional History''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1998. 75–100. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

CTR as pedagogy has been almost universally employed by schools since its inception in the late nineteenth century, and until the 1960s, its limitations and ineffectiveness received little criticism. However, the 1966 Dartmouth Conference reflected an influx of new scholarly ideas about composition studies that introduced the ideas of process over product and the notion that teachers should serve as guides in the composition process rather than dictatorial authority figures. Since then, the main elements of composition pedagogy have been defined and explored by countless scholars, and the concepts associated with CTR have been replaced by a wealth of pedagogical approaches to the field of rhetoric and composition. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the field of rhetoric and composition saw a process revolution, fueled by two distinct pedagogies: expressivism, both moderate and radical, and cognitivism.

==Moderate expressivism and radical expressivism==

The composition pedagogy of moderate expressivism is characterized by a focus on language as a tool for personal rather than social expression, based on the [[process theory of composition]], a belief that the process of writing should be more important than the final product. Further, moderate expressivist pedagogy calls for fewer grammatical standards and an increased focus on the writer’s process of discovery and expression. W.E. Coles, Jr. suggests that teaching writing should be approached as teaching art, with the teacher serving as facilitator or guide for the student-writer’s free expression; he also calls for classroom practices such as peer-reviews, class discussions, and the absence of grades, in order to best guide the self-identification he sees as crucial to the writing process.&lt;ref&gt;Coles, Jr., W.E. “The Teaching of Writing as Writing.” ''College English'' 29.2 (1967): 111–16. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow moderate expressivist Donald Murray maintains that writing is a process of discovery and experimentation, a search for truth in a specious world; his manifesto-like essay provides an apt summation of the arguments against the dated pedagogy of CTR.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Donald. “Teach Writing as a Process Not Product.” ''The Leaflet'' (Fall 1972): 11–14. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Maxine Hairston recognizes the paradigm shift occurring in rhetoric and composition and calls for a non-prescriptive atmosphere in teaching, including less focus on grammar and syntax and, again, more concern with the process of growth experienced by the writer.&lt;ref&gt;Hairston, Maxine. “The Winds of Change: Thomas Kuhn and the Revolution in the Teaching of Writing.” ''College Composition and Communication'' 33.1 (1982): 76–88. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Elbow]] reflects moderate expressivist ideals in his claim that audience should be ignored during the early stages of the writing process, in order to avoid the hindrance of audience expectation and facilitate writer-based rather than reader-based text. Elbow writes, “It’s not that writers should never think about their audience. It’s a question of when.”&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, Peter. “Closing My Eyes As I Speak: An Argument for Ignoring Audience.” ''College English'' 49.1 (1987): 50–69. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, moderate expressivism promotes the notion of process over product, a pedagogy that evolved in the height of the 1960s and in many ways reflects the ideologies of the era in its emphasis on freedom, expression, discovery, and a search for the writer’s authentic self.

Radical expressivism evolved from the pedagogical ideals of moderate expressivism, and its primary difference lies in its focus on group, rather than individual, development and expression. For example, In 1966, Susan Sontag published a collection of essays in which she stresses the importance of Happenings, “a cross between art exhibit and theatrical performance,” in order to facilitate a sense of group identity, community, and engagement with audience through a shared, unique artistic experience.&lt;ref&gt;Sontag, Susan. “Happenings: An Art of Radical Juxtaposition.” ''Against Interpretation and Other Essays''. New York: Picador, 2001. 263–74. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Radical expressivists Charles Deemer and William Lutz also suggest that English composition should be taught as and considered a sort of Happening. Deemer locates the problem with the composition course in its lack of subject content and asserts that writing demands inspiration that can be attained from teacher-induced Happenings, as “clear writing and clear thought follow only after clear experiences.”&lt;ref&gt;Deemer, Charles. “English Composition as a Happening.” ''College English'' 29.2 (1967): 121–26. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Lutz’ claims are similar to those of Deemer, noting the need for creative inspiration in the classroom, a typically stagnant environment in which he claims nothing creative can be taught; he argues for the employment of Happenings in the English classroom in order to “make the student respond directly to his own experience and not someone else’s.”&lt;ref&gt;Lutz, William D. “Making Freshman English a Happening.” ''College Composition and Communication'' 22.1 (1971): 35–8. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Other such pedagogues include [[Marshall McLuhan]], who presents the idea of using hot, engaging media when teaching rather than cold, sterile media in the classroom,&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. “Media Hot and Cold.” ''Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man''. Ed. Terrence W. Gordon. Corte Madera, CA : Gingko Press, 2003. 22–32. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and Geoffrey Sirc, who promotes an avant-garde approach to composition pedagogy by encouraging students’ exuberant, unpolished expressions in writing. Sirc can almost be considered a “post-social turn” theorist; his 1980s research claims that the traditional classroom space is confining and argues that the language of “Main Street” should be encouraged in student writing, attacking the idea of suitable “academic” writing presented by theorists like [[David Bartholomae]].&lt;ref&gt;Sirc, Geoffrey. “Writing Classroom as A &amp; P Parking Lot.” ''English Composition as a Happening''. Logan: Utah State UP, 2002. 185–235. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in his own English classroom, Sirc employs the study of rap music and its cultural and racial implications; he views rap music as “loaded with language, desire, style, and humanity” and imbued with poetry he describes as “blunt narratives of the human heart,” teaching students about truth, communication, and reality and effectively strengthening their writing.&lt;ref&gt;Sirc, Geoffrey. “Stagolee as Writing Instructor.” ''Enculturation'' 4.2 (2002): n. pag. Web. 24 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://enculturation.gmu.edu/4_2/sirc/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while retaining many of the ideals of individuality and uninhibited expression associated with Moderate Expressivism, the composition pedagogy of radical expressivism is distinguished by its focus on group reality and community experience, belief in the art and inspirational potential of the Happening, and view that popular media can potentially be used as a pedagogical tool.

==Cognitivism==

The pedagogy of cognitivism prevalent in the early 1970s and early 1980s also promotes the idea of process over product, but it is a more scientific approach to composition studies and is opposed to moderate expressivism in many ways. Abstractly speaking, cognitivists believe that thinking exists in the mind apart from language and are concerned with understanding how language—or writing—is developed from mental processes of the mind. Cognitivists are primarily concerned with the goals of a writer, the decisions made during the writing process by the mind. [[Andrea Lunsford]] addresses the importance of understanding the cognitive mental faculties involved during composition, claiming that the best way to facilitate the writing process is through workshops and discussion rather than lecture-based instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Lunsford, Andrea. “Cognitive Development and the Basic Writer.” ''College English'' 41.1 (1979): 38–46. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers like cognitivist Sondra Perl conduct extensive studies of the composing process and the stages through which a writer goes in order to better understand how to teach writing.&lt;ref&gt;Perl, Sondra. “The Composing Process of Unskilled College Writers.” ''Research in the Teaching of English'' 13.4 (1979): 317–36. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitivists [[Linda Flower]] and John Hayes see an exigency in composition studies to understand how and why a writer makes the choices they do during the writing process. Their research led them to claim that writing is a non-linear, hierarchal, goal-driven process. In addition, they concentrate their study of composition on the protocol of the writing process, including planning, translating, embedding, and reviewing.&lt;ref&gt;Flower, Linda, and John R. Hayes. “A Cognitive Process Theory of Writing.” ''College Composition and Communication'' 32.4 (1981): 365–87. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; While like expressivists in their greater concern with the process of writing than with the final product, distinguishing them from the essay-driven pedagogy of current-traditional rhetoric, cognitivism proposes a more scientific approach by studying universal cognitive faculties of the mind in order to better understand the composition process.

==Social constructionism==

Unlike cognitivism, [[social constructionism]], or the “social turn” in composition pedagogy, which evolved the 1980s, is distinguished by the belief that language and the mind are inseparable, as an individual needs language in order to even think. Social constructionist theories also promote the idea that writing is inherently political in nature and that writers are each a part of a particular community of dialogue, or discourse community, with an assumed set of principles and a distinct language of its own. Patricia Bizzell directly attacks the early cognitivist contention that writing can be understood as distinct sets of mental processes, criticizing “inner-directed” theorists like Flowers and Hayes for focusing too much on the individual writer’s language and learning processes and overlooking the importance of society and discourse communities in composition; on the other hand, “outer-directed” theorists like Bizzell recognize the extent to which thinking and language are conditioned by the social context and intended audience being addressed by the writer. Writing, Bizzell claims, “takes place within a community,” and in order to improve composition, teachers should “explain what the community’s conventions are."&lt;ref&gt;Bizzell, Patricia. “Cognition, Convention, and Certainty: What We Need to Know about Writing.” ''PRE/TEXT'' 3.3 (1982): 213–43. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Social constructionist James Porter notes the “intertextuality” of all writing as interdependent, based on the principle that all speech and writing evolves from presumed meaning and accepted evidence as defined by each “discourse community,” which Porter defines as “a group of individuals bound by a common interest who communicate through approved channels and whose discourse is regulated.”&lt;ref&gt;Porter, James E. “Intertextuality and the Discourse Community.” ''Rhetoric Review'' 5.1 (1986): 34–47. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Harris agrees with Porter, maintaining that writing is community-driven and noting that the purpose in writing is drawn from “being part of some ongoing discourse.” However, Harris qualifies his argument by noting that, while writers act not as isolated individuals but as members of discourse communities with certain language, practices, and beliefs, the notion that academic or other discourse communities are “discursive utopias” existing without conflict is irrational.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Joseph. “The Idea of Community in the Study of Writing.” ''College Composition and Communication'' 40.1 (1989): 11–22. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; David Bartholomae suggests that students must be assimilated to a specialized discourse in order to write; he writes that students “have to invent the university by assembling and mimicking its language,” learning the “requirements of [academic] convention,” and understanding the “history of a discipline” in order to successfully write and communicate within that discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomae, David. “Inventing the University.” ''When a Writer Can’t Write: Studies in Writer’s Block and Other Composing Process Problems''. Ed. Mike Rose. New York: Guilford, 1985. 273–85. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Suggesting an existing conflict between academics and writers, Peter Elbow argues that writing students should not be exposed to the dialogic discourse of academia, as it can be intimidating and ineffective; instead, Elbow suggests that students read and study each other’s writings in the early stages of composition, in order to facilitate a sense of monologic freedom by focusing on the students’ own unique voices.&lt;ref&gt;Elbow, Peter. “Being a Writer vs. Being an Academic: A Conflict in Goals.” ''College Composition and Communication'' 46.1 (1995): 72–83. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social turn in composition pedagogy witnessed a move for community ideology and a newfound acknowledgment of the social, economic, and political forces that affect writers and discourse. James Berlin states, “The question of ideology has never been far from discussions of writing instruction in the modern American college,” and he notes that the writing classroom has always been a place for addressing questions pertaining to ideological subject matter such as class, race, economics, and civil rights. He proposes what is known as a social-epistemic model of writing instruction, in which the socially-constructed nature of knowledge and knowing is recognized. Berlin notes that “social epistemic rhetoric views knowledge as an arena of ideological conflict,” and such a writing pedagogy “offers an explicit critique of economic, political, and social arrangements.”&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, James A. “Rhetoric and Ideology in the Writing Class.” ''College English'' 50.5 (1988): 477–93. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the social turn in composition pedagogy represented a move for increased recognition of rhetorical discourse communities, the social, cultural, and political forces that influence the classroom, and the ways that ideology affects writers and the writing classroom.

==Critical pedagogy==

Critical pedagogy was the next phase of pedagogical development in the field of composition studies, and its ideas evolved in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Lisa Delpit explores the way that power works in the classroom, shaped by varied socioeconomic and cultural conditions of students and teachers, results in alienation and miscommunication in the classroom that she terms the “silenced dialogue." Delpit names five specific aspects of the current ‘culture of power’ that defines the conflicting power dynamic in the classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Delpit, Lisa D. “The Silenced Dialogue: Power and Pedagogy in Educating Other People’s Children.” ''Harvard Educational Review'' 58.3 (1998): 280–98. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Paulo Freire criticizes the oppressive nature of education and the current educational system’s use of the “banking model” approach to teaching, wherein students serve as depositories for information provided to them by the teacher. While Delpit suggests that the oppressed should be provided with the necessary skills to enable them to enter the culture of power, Freire demands a transformation of the culture of power through revolutionary, practical literary training. Furthermore, Freire posits that human beings are situated in certain temporal and spatial conditions that define who they are, either oppressor or oppressed, and he suggests that dialogue defines humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Freire, Paulo. ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed''. New York: Continuum Books, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Elizabeth Ellsworth discusses the oppressive myths that perpetuate power dynamics in the classroom, including racism on campuses. She calls for a new critical pedagogy “of the unknowable,” suggesting a need to recognize the absence of universal notions of dialogue, rationality, or knowledge, and instead openly acknowledge the many differing social groups and discourse communities in every classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Ellsworth, Elizabeth. ‘Why Doesn’t This Feel Empowering?: Working Through the Repressive Myths of Critical Pedagogy.” ''Harvard Educational Review'' 59.3 (1989): 297–324. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, critical pedagogy can be seen as/in an activist pedagogy, taking into account political inequalities and empowering students to take action through their writing.

==Post-structuralism==

The pedagogy of post-structuralism is marked by an attempt to redefine rhetoric as it relates to composition, drawing on post-modern ideology calling for new ideas in a modern world. For example, Victor Vitanza suggests that writing is an entity of its own, existing apart from institutions, social mores, and even writers. He believes that the intention of writing should be to infect the reader with new ideas that disrupt the rational, controlled world. Vitanza also notes that writing can be seen as a metadiscipline, as rhetoric applies to any field in which the artist attempts to convey a message, including photography and choreography, as writing is a performative and not authoritative act.&lt;ref&gt;Vitanza, Victor J. “Abandoned to Writing: Notes Toward Several Provocations.” ''Enculturation'' 5.1 (2003): n. pag. Web. 14 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://enculturation.gmu.edu/5_1/vitanza.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Sharon Crowley views rhetoric as invention and discovery by identifying the available means of persuasion in making one’s argument. Furthermore, Crowley believes rhetoric has a civic purpose, as it changes the society in which it is engaged; she attests that rhetoric is the art of giving effectiveness to truth, and notes that it is persuasive and always moving.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Sharon. “Composition is not Rhetoric.” ''Enculturation'' 5.1 (2003): n. pag. Web. 14 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://enculturation.gmu.edu/5_1/crowley.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==

The fields of composition and rhetoric remain in flux, as scholars continue to debate regarding appropriate pedagogical methods and the best approach to teaching the art of writing. Since the post-structuralism movement in composition pedagogy, there has been an explosion of discussion in the field of composition pedagogy. More recent ideas in composition pedagogy include the notion of rhetoric’s relationship to travel, on which pedagogues such as Gregory Clark&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Gregory “Writing as Travel, or Rhetoric on the Road.” ''College Composition and Communication'' 49.1 (1998): 9–23. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and Nedra Reynolds&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Nedra. “Who’s Going to Cross this Border? Travel Metaphors, Material Conditions, and Contested Places.” ''JAC'' 20.3 (2000): 541–64. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; have written. In addition, composition studies is an umbrella term for the considerations of writing pedagogy. In its academic application, it is post-modern or post-structural, working both outside and within other academic disciplines.  The national [[Conference on College Composition and Communication]] (CCCC) is a national professional association of writing instructors in the United States, the largest organization dedicated to writing research, theory, and teaching pedagogy worldwide. At the annual CCCC convention, pedagogues from around the country deliver their recent research and theories to colleagues. While the goals, methods, and desired results in composition studies are debated and continue to evolve, the importance of writing to the field of education has been indisputably recognized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3481">[[File:Use case restaurant model.svg|thumb|right|A [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] use case diagram for the interaction of a client (the actor) within a restaurant (the system)]]
{{UML diagram types}}A '''use case diagram''' at its simplest is a representation of a user's interaction with the system that shows the relationship between the user and the different [[Use case|use cases]] in which the user is involved. A use case diagram can identify the different types of users of a system and the different use cases and will often be accompanied by other types of diagrams as well. The use cases are represented by either circles or ellipses.

== Application ==
While a [[Use Case|use case]] itself might drill into a lot of detail about every possibility, a use-case diagram can help provide a higher-level view of the system. It has been said before that "Use case diagrams are the blueprints for your system".&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin et al, 2006, page 297&lt;/ref&gt; They provide the simplified and graphical representation of what the system must actually do.

Due to their simplistic nature, use case diagrams can be a good communication tool for [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]]. The drawings attempt to mimic the real world and provide a view for the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]] to understand how the system is going to be designed. Siau and Lee conducted research to determine if there was a valid situation for use case diagrams at all or if they were unnecessary. What was found was that the use case diagrams conveyed the intent of the system in a more simplified manner to [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] and that they were "interpreted more completely than class diagrams".&lt;ref&gt;Siau &amp; Lee, 2004, page 234&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the use case diagrams is simply to provide the high level view of the system and convey the requirements in laypeople's terms for the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]]. Additional diagrams and documentation can be used to provide a complete functional and technical view of the system.

{{Neo-fascism}}

'''Wotansvolk''' is a form of [[White nationalism|white nationalist]], [[neo-völkisch]] paganism which was founded in the early 1990s by Ron McVan, Katja Lane and [[David Lane (white supremacist)|David Lane]] (1938–2007) while Lane was serving a 190-year prison sentence for his actions in connection with the white separatist revolutionary [[domestic terrorist]] organization [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]], of which he was a member. After the founding of 14 Word Press by David Lane and his wife Katja to disseminate her husband's writings, Ron McVan joined the press in 1995 and founded Temple of Wotan (co-writing a book by that name). 14 Word Press - Wotansvolk proceeded to publish several books for the practice of Wotanism before becoming defunct in the early 2000s.

==History==
Wotansvolk was launched after Lane published an article in 1995 titled "Wotan's Folk", which gave the group its name. ''Wotan'' is the Germanic name for [[Odin]], a central figure in [[Norse mythology]] and other [[Germanic mythology|Germanic mythologies]]. Lane had been publishing white supremacist and neopagan work under the name "14 Word Press" with his wife Katja Lane, and Ron McVan, an artist who had become involved with [[white separatism]] in the 1970s after reading the works of [[Ben Klassen]]. During this time, Wotansvolk published monthly pamphlets, maintained a [[website]], and made and sold Odinist religious objects. The publishers also operated a prison outreach program.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gardell|2004|p=205–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2001, prison groups in the [[United States|US]] were linked with Wotansvolk. Research by [[Mattias Gardell]] indicated "a pagan revival among the white prison population, including the conversion of whole [[prison gang]]s to the ancestral religion....Partly due to the reputation of Lane and its association with the legendary [[The Order (white supremacist group)|Brüders Schweigen]], Wotansvolk's name-recognition is high among the Aryan prison population".&lt;ref name="Gardell217"&gt;{{harvnb|Gardell|2003|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several members of The Order were practicing Wotanists, including its founder [[Robert Jay Mathews|Robert Mathews]], David Lane and Richard Scutari along with Richard Kemp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2000/neo-pagans-peter-georgacarakos-david-lane-and-richard-scutari-publishing-prison|title=Neo-Pagans Peter Georgacarakos, David Lane and Richard Scutari Publishing from Prison|author=|date=|website=SPLCenter.org|access-date=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wotansvolk is one of many groups active in prisoner outreach, but, according to Gardell, "Wotansvolk seem[ed] more successful in its outreach efforts than other Asatrú/Odinist programs".&lt;ref name="Gardell217" /&gt; Non-racist versions of Asatrú and Odinism are protected{{By whom|date=August 2017}} as free speech, but violent and racist religious materials, such as Wotanism, may be banned or restricted from prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mark Pitcavage of the Anti-Defamation League Discusses Race-Based Gangs and other Extremists in Prison|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2015/mark-pitcavage-anti-defamation-league-discusses-race-based-gangs-and-other-extremists|access-date=29 May 2017|work=Intelligence Report|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=Winter 2002|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Supreme Court Requires Prisons Give Special Consideration to Racist Pagans|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2009/supreme-court-requires-prisons-give-special-consideration-racist-pagans|access-date=29 May 2017|work=Intelligence Report|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=Fall 2009|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
Wotansvolk practitioners see their [[religion]] as being rooted in ancestral European paganism which was driven underground, calling it the true spiritual heritage of the "Euro-Tribes".{{cn|date=May 2017}} Followers of the movement often selectively cite [[Carl Jung]]'s theories of an "Aryan [[collective subconscious]]" or [[race-soul]], specifically his 1936 essay "Wotan".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gardell|2004|pp=208, 210–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Wotanism in modern times emphasizes [[white nationalism]], [[white separatism]] and an [[ethnocentric]], pan-European interpretation of [[modern Paganism]].

Unlike many [[Germanic neopaganism|Germanic neopagans]] within [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]], most Wotanists do not exclusively revere the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] pantheon of [[Asatru]] but rather all the deities of European mythology. Wotanists may reject [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]], include [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] ideas, and see David Lane as a [[prophet]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Lane's followers see the [[14 words]] and the [[88 Precepts]] as [[religious text|scripture]] and they primarily see the gods as [[Jungian archetypes]], although Lane said one could be a [[deist]], a [[pantheist]], or an [[atheist]] and still be Wotansvolk.&lt;ref&gt;see: Gambanreidi Statement; Wotanism by Professor Carl Gustav Jung Compiled by the late, Jost Turner [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/gambanreidi.geo/wotanjung.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+22:28:02]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gardell|2003|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; McVan and Lane have described many rituals and practices, none of which are required of practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gardell|2004|pp=214–217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Wotanists consider the ''[[Hávamál]]'' to be their holiest text while rites of practice are taken from Lane's writings.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

Lane often used 'Odinist' and 'Wotanist' as synonymous in his writings, and the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] regards Lane's Wotanism as a form of Odinism.&lt;ref name="SPLC1998"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Brand of Racist Odinist Religion on the March|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/1998/new-brand-racist-odinist-religion-march|accessdate=30 May 2017|work=Intelligence Report|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=Winter 1998|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lane stated that he had chosen the name "Wotanism" in conscious contrast to [[Anti-Racist Action|anti-racist]] heathens and those motivated by "universalist" ideology who Lane deemed were advancing [[White genocide conspiracy theory|white genocide]].{{cn|date=May 2017}}

Although Lane was contemptuous of [[Christianity]], viewing it as part of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world, he viewed the [[Bible]] as containing secret codes hidden by pre-Christian, non-Jewish Aryan masters. Lane stated that this [[Bible code]] was carried over into the [[King James Version]], which he believed [[Sir Francis Bacon]] had translated. Lane also taught something which he called "Pyramid Prophecy" which according to him, said his name and birth-date were prophesied in the Bible as being connected to the coming of the [[Antichrist]], and embodying the spirits of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Thor]], and [[David|King David]] while being described as "the ''Man'' of prophecy", the "''666 Man''" and the "''Joseph Smith of Wotanism''".{{sfnp|Gardell|2003|p=381}}

Universalist Asatruars (notably [[The Troth]]) and some non-folkish [[Odinists]] have rejected what they perceive as an attempt to appropriate the revival of the ancient native faith of [[northern Europe]] for [[political]] and [[racial]] ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gardell|2003|pp=273–283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folkish Odinists, such as [[Stephen McNallen]] of the [[Asatru Folk Assembly]], generally support Lane's version of Wotanism and the [[Fourteen Words]].&lt;ref name="SPLC1998"/&gt; Lane issued a declaration called "Moral Authority", as well, which calls the [[United States]] a "[[Flag of the United States|Red, White and Blue]] traveling mass murder machine" intent on committing [[White genocide conspiracy theory|genocide against white people]]. According to the declaration, "true moral authority belongs to those who resist" this purported genocide.&lt;ref name="adl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/lane.asp?xpicked=2&amp;item=lane |title=David Lane |website=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103094309/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/lane.asp?xpicked=2&amp;item=lane |archivedate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gardell|2004|pp=202–204, 381}}&lt;/ref&gt;
