An '''acting coach''' or '''drama coach''' is a [[teacher]] who trains performers–typically film, television, theatre and, [[musical theatre]] [[actor]]s–and gives them advice and [[mentoring]] to enable them to improve their acting and dramatic performances, prepare for [[audition]]s and prepare better for roles.
==Qualifications and roles==
Acting coaches need to have a "talent...for reading people, all their utterances and [[body language]]."&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;Eric Liu. "The People Whisperers:What a Hollywood acting coach taught me about teaching" in Slate. http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/teachings/2005/01/the_people_whisperers.html&lt;/ref&gt; Acting coaches have been called "people whisperers", a reference to "[[horse whisperer]]s" who help to train animals.&lt;ref name=Liu /&gt; Acting coach [[Ivana Chubbuck]] states that one of her roles is to ensure that "every actor...must know what the character's objective is in a scene—to win someone's love, respect, sympathy, whatever—and then must have a ruthlessness about achieving the objective."&lt;ref name=Liu /&gt; Chubbuck works with actors to help them to connect with the emotion inside the character.&lt;ref name=Liu /&gt; Acting coaches also "...help [drama] students audition for college".&lt;ref name=mcmahon&gt;Regan McMahon. "THEATER Acting coach preps drama students for college auditions" in ''The Chronicle'' Saturday, January 22, 2011 http://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/Acting-coaches-help-students-audition-for-college-2478509.php&lt;/ref&gt; Acting coach and actor Woodell-Mascall is "...skilled at zeroing in on what young actors need to do to improve their performance." Woodell-Mascall tells one student actor to "...really think about who [the character] is and what she's feeling. It's got to be real.&lt;ref name=mcmahon /&gt; She provides [[constructive criticism]] to students. Woodell-Mascall has helped students to get into drama programs at schools "...including NYU, Juilliard, Rutgers and UCLA".&lt;ref name=mcmahon /&gt; Some acting coaches use an "...approach and technique of acting training [that] are considered established, proven methods of creating the [dramatic] work", such as using the "...methodology of [[Constantin Stanislavski]], [[Stella Adler]], [[Uta Hagen]], [[Lee Strasberg]], and [[Sanford Meisner]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://kimtobinactingstudio.com/faqs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some acting coaches provide students with a DVD or SD card recording of their acting, for the student to review their progress.

==Notable individuals==
Major acting coaches include: [[Larry Moss (acting coach)|Larry Moss]], [[Ivana Chubbuck]], [[Michelle Danner]], [[Terry Schreiber]], [[David Mamet]], [[Lee Strasberg]], [[Michael Woolson]], [[Stella Adler]], [[Chambers Stevens]], and [[Sanford Meisner]].

==Working conditions==
Acting coaches may be freelancers who are hired for an hourly or daily rate, or they may be hired on a longer-term basis by a [[film studio]], [[production company]] or [[theatre company]]. Some acting coaches have developed their own unique methods and founded their own acting schools. Acting coaches' income varies a great deal from one coach to another. For example, an acting coach providing training to a community theatre troupe or a high school musical earns much less than an acting coach training top [[Hollywood]] celebrities. Acting classes are often provided in person; however, with the widespread availability of high-speed Internet, some coaches offer mentoring online over [[Skype]] or other video linkups. Acting coaches may offer private coaching, group sessions or a combination of both.

==Other roles==
In some cases, acting coaches are hired to train [[singer]]s in acting skills. Popular music singers may need to learn acting skills for their live concert shows, which sometimes include staged sequences, and for performing in [[music video]]s. For example, Goth-rocker [[Amy Lee]] was provided with an acting coach by her record label. In [[Classical music]], singers performing staged [[opera]]s may get help from an acting coach to prepare them for their roles. Sometimes CEOs and other leaders hire acting coaches to help them improve their performance of speeches and other general communications activities. While most acting coaches mentor actors, some also coach directors on how to improve their direction of actors. Some acting coaches offer introductions to the acting industry, to help new actors learn about auditions, the casting process, the role of agents, key acting terminology (e.g., "[[wikt:callback|callback]]" auditions), and about important industry organizations.

'''Action Bioscience''' is a non-commercial, educational [[web site]] sponsored by the [[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] (AIBS) . It was created to promote [[Biology|bioscience]] [[scientific literacy|literacy]] and bring attention to seven bioscience issues of critical current importance: 1) [[Biodiversity]], 2) [[Natural environment|Environment]], 3) [[Genomics]], 4) [[Biotechnology]], 5) [[Evolution]], 6) New Frontiers, and 7) Science [[Education]]

The organization seeks to:

* motivate the public to play an active role in bioscience education
* show how developments in bioscience research can affect everyone
* promote an understanding of biogeography and the biodiversity of life
* engage the public to reflect on the relationship between human activity and the natural course of evolution
* promote global ecological awareness
* advance formal and informal bioscience education
* encourage students to pursue studies in the biosciences

To meet these goals, the web site provides articles by scientists, science educators, and science students on issues related to seven bioscience challenges: environment, biodiversity, genomics, biotechnology, evolution, new frontiers in science, and bioscience education. In addition, the web site provides educators with original lessons and resources to enhance bioscience teaching. Up-to-date external links are provided at the bottom of each article to help the reader "learn more" about or "get involved" in the issue. Selected articles are translated into Spanish.

It won an award as one of the best sci-tech web sites by [[Scientific American]].&lt;ref&gt;"2003 Sci/Tech Web Awards: BIOLOGY", Scientific American, http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000A436B-4DC2-1ECA-8E1C809EC588EF21, accessed December 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4492">'''Association of Law Students’ Library of the Jagiellonian University''' (pol. ''Towarzystwo Biblioteki Słuchaczów Prawa Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego'' – ''TBSP UJ'') is the oldest and one of the biggest student scientific associations in [[Poland]]. 

==History==

TBSP was established on 23 June 1851, the aim of the association was to organize and equip an independent law library for Polish law students at [[Jagiellonian University]], which was [[Germanisation|Germanised]] at that time as [[Galicia (Central Europe)#Galician autonomy|Galician autonomy]] has not been introduced yet.

Association’s activities could be performed thanks to multiple donations made by professors and students. The book collection was growing systematically as well as TBSP’s activities – as early as in 1890s scientific and oratorical competitions, congresses and lectures were orgranised. The association was actively participating in patriotic initiatives in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]].

During the years 1914-1915, when [[Jagiellonian University]] was closed, TBSP moved to [[Vienna]] to continue its activities there and came back to [[Kraków]] after re-opening of the university. During the [[Second World War]], the association joined [[Education in Poland during World War II|underground education]] and made its library (the part which has not been requisitioned yet) fully available to students. 
In 1950, when [[Poland]] found itself in the [[History_of_Communism#Communism_in_Eastern_Europe_during_the_post-war_era|Soviet zone of influence]], the association was formally liquidated, its headquarters taken over by university and its book collection – by the [[Jagiellonian Library]]; scripts duplicating centre was suppressed. However TBSP’s traditions were continued by informal circles of penal law students and historians of law.
In 1957 TBSP was officially reactivated, efforts have been made to recover the book collection. Since that time, the association has not been an independent entity but a unit of [[Jagiellonian University]].

==Activities==

At present, TBSP unites about 1500 students and runs various educational and cultural activities. In the framework of 23 sections, additional classes are organised for younger students to help them prepare for participation in faculty competitions and final examinations. More advanced students participate in discussions and specialist workshops organised in cooperation with partner institutions and law firms. The association runs intensive publishing activities, just to mention regular Scientific Books of the TBSP UJ or repetitory courses for students. Traditionally, respective sections organise study trips to the [[Constitutional Tribunal of the Republic of Poland|Constitutional Tribunal]], the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of Poland|Supreme Court]] etc., to help students to get to know most important [[Politics of Poland|Polish institutions]]. Each year various scientific congresses are organized, many of them of international dimension, while permanent evening meetings with the most prominent professors and law practitioners allow students to get some less formal contact with legal profession.

==Notable ancient members==

'''Austrian Service Abroad''' is a non-profit initiative and was founded in 1998 by [[Andreas Maislinger]] and [[Andreas Hörtnagl]]. Since 2001 [[Michael Prochazka]] is part of the managing committee.

==General information==
The association for Services Abroad, founded in 1998 by [[Andreas Hörtnagl]] and [[Andreas Maislinger]] was renamed in 2006 as Austrian Service Abroad. Since 2001 [[Michael Prochazka]] is also in the board of directors of the non-governmental organization. Once a month a meeting takes place in each federal state.

==Structure==
[[File:Auschwitz 1.jpg|thumb|First young Austrian started in [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum|Auschwitz]] on [[Invasion of Poland|September 1]], 1992]]
The organization provides positions for an alternative Austrian national service all over the world and is based in [[Innsbruck]]. The regular nine month alternative national service (Zivildienst) is substituted by a 12-month service at one of its partner organisations abroad. There are great variations in the requirements. Austrian Service Abroad is an institution which provides young male Austrians with a government funded alternative to the compulsory military service. Its main focuses are [[social work]] and [[Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service|Holocaust Memorial Service]].

==Types of service==
Austrian Service Abroad offers three different types of Zivildienst-substitutes: 
* [[Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service]] ([[:de:Österreichischer Gedenkdienst|Österreichischer Gedenkdienst]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austrianinformation.org/winter-2009/austrian-holocaust-memorial-service.html |title=Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service |work=Austrian Information |year=2009 |publisher=Austrian Press and Information Service |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This program was founded in 1992 and has been a part of the association Austrian Service Abroad since 1998. It deals with the victims of Nazism. Austrian Holocaust Memorial servants work for [[Holocaust]] memorials, like museums and research facilities (for example at the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] in Los Angeles, the [[Jewish Museum Berlin]], the [[European Roma Rights Centre]] in Budapest or [[Yad Vashem]] in Jerusalem)

For several years now, Austrian Holocaust Memorial servants also have been sent to assignments in former refuge countries of the victim groups persecuted by the [[Nazis]], for example the Casa Stefan Zweig in [[Petrópolis]] (Brazil), the Centre for Jewish Studies in Shanghai, as well as the [[Jewish Museum of Australia]] in Melbourne. Since 1992 hundreds of young Austrian Holocaust Memorial servants in 22 countries have reappraised the history of the Holocaust worldwide and made an important contribution to the Austrian processing of history.

* [[Austrian Social Service]] ([[:de:Österreichischer Sozialdienst|Österreichischer Sozialdienst]])

It is performed within the scope of projects that serve the economic and social development of the respective country. Social servants are active in the following areas: projects for street-children, educational projects and children's villages, care for the old and handicapped, medical care as well as care and help for homosexuals.

Further places of assignment are environmental projects and developing projects (for example: improvement of drinking water supplies) in the countries of the [[Third World]]. Andreas Daniel Matt, the first foreign servant of the year who has provided his social service in 2004 in a SOS children's village in Lahore (Pakistan) has, with the organization proLoka, founded even another place of assignment.

Since October, 1998 hundreds of Austrian Social servants were predominantly assigned to countries in Central and South America, Africa and Asia. But also organizations like royal London Society for the Blind in England and the orphanage faith in [[Saint Petersburg]] (Russia) are part of this worldwide network.

* [[Austrian Peace Service]] (Österreichischer Friedensdienst)

Peace servants are occupied within organizations that serve the achievement or protection of peace in connection with armed conflicts. They work, e.g., in non-state organizations in Israel where they organize workshops or common initiatives of the conflicting parties.

In [[Nanjing]] in China a peace service application place exists since 2008 in the [[John Rabe]] house which reappraises the massacre of Nanjing in 1937. This edged out event still strains the Sino-Japanese relations and was decisive in 2005 for wide protests in Beijing and other towns. The Japanese school book quarrel led in China to movements against falsification of history in Japanese school books. That's why the [[Austrian Peace Service]] donated together with the Thomas Rabe Community Center in 2009 for the first time the John Rabe Award.

==International Council==

'''Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences''' ('''ANAS''') ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Milli Elmlər Akademiyası (AMEA)}}), located in [[Baku]], is the main state research organization and the primary body that conducts research and coordinates activities in the fields of science and [[social science]]s in [[Azerbaijan]]. It was established on 23 January 1945. 

The President of ANAS is Acad. [[Akif Alizadeh]] and the Academician-Secretary of ANAS is Acad. [[Rasim Alguliyev]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.gov.az/pages/apparat-prezidiuma-nana Administration of the Presidium of ANAS] (accessed 25 April 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

One section of the ANAS is [[Republican Seismic Survey Center of Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences]]. 

== History ==
The Academy was based on the Azerbaijan Society for Scientific Research and Studies, which was first affiliated with [[Baku State University]] and later with the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]].

In 1923 the Azerbaijan Society for Researches and Studies that included history, ethnography, economics and natural sciences, was established as the leading scientific institution of Azerbaijan by initiative of Nariman Narimanov. In 1929 the Society was reorganized into Azerbaijan State Scientific Research Institute (ASSRI). ASSRI were coordinating scientific research works, and training scientific cadres for specialized high and secondary schools. In 1932, the Azerbaijani Branch of the Transcaucasian Affiliate of the USSR Academy of Sciences, consisting of 11 divisions and several committees, was organized on the basis of ASSRI. The head of the Branch was A. Ruhulla. Famous Russian scientists such as [[Ivan Gubkin]], Alexander Grossheim, I. Meshshaninov,  Iosif Yesman, and Azerbaijani scholars such as Bakir Chobanzadeh, Musa Afandiyev, Veli Khuluflu, A. Mammadov, [[Salman Mumtaz]], A. Taghizadeh, etc. conducted scientific researches here.

In 1935, Azerbaijani Branch of the Transcaucasian Affiliate of the USSR Academy of Sciences was reorganized into the Azerbaijani Affiliate of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Chemical, Botany, Zoology, History, Ethnography and Archeology, Language and Literature research institutions, as well as the Divisions of Energy, Physics, Geology, and Soil Science were established on the base of the existing departments of the Branch. 

In 1945, the USSR [[Council of People's Commissars]] ordered the society to be reorganized into the Academy of Sciences of the [[Azerbaijan SSR]]. During its first year, the Academy numbered 15 members; [[Uzeyir Hajibeyov]] and [[Samad Vurgun]] among them.&lt;ref name="estab"&gt;[http://www.elm.az/en/cat.php?fid=history Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences: Establishment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125185501/http://www.elm.az/en/cat.php?fid=history |date=25 January 2007 }}. ''Science.az''. Retrieved 31 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In accord with presidential decree (May 15, 2001), the Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences was granted the status of "National Academy of Sciences" (ANAS), after 2 years ANAS was given the status of supreme state body carrying out the scientific and scientific-technical policy of Azerbaijan. Its Charter was granted the state document. 

Following the presidential decrees dated January 12, 2004 and 5 May 2004, the Encyclopedia of Azerbaijan was a part of ANAS and the Scientific Center of the National Encyclopedia of Azerbaijan was established.

== Criticism ==
The Academy was criticized by several members of the [[National Assembly (Azerbaijan)|National Assembly]], in July 2012 for publishing a children's tale called ''"The Unwanted Son-In-Law,"'' which contained vulgar language and graphic scenes of incest. The story was published in 2007 in the sixth volume of the ambiguously titled "Tales" anthology. Kamila Aliyeva, a member of the Science and Education Committee was quoted as saying "I wonder if they were aware of the contents of the book," she asked. "If they were, it is shameful. And if they were not, it is also shameful."&lt;ref name=Incest&gt;{{cite news|last=Deana Kjuka|first=Rovshan Gambarov|title='Shameful' Folktale of Incest, Vulgarity Causes Outrage in Azerbaijan|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/azerbaijan-folklore-controversy/24651450.html|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Black Gold''''' (also known as ''Oil Imperium'') is a [[video game]] of the [[strategy game|strategy]] genre released in 1989 by [[reLINE Software]].

==Summary==
The goal of the game is to promote and sell oil and defeat competitors using a number of fair and unfair strategies. A game move always takes a month, and each action in the game costs one or more days.

The game is designed for four players, either human (using a hot seat method) or computer-controlled. Players take on the management of one of four corporations: "Interoil", "All American", "Transoil" or "Explora Inc."

There are four different game objectives to choose from: to play a three-year game, to survive the longest of all the game companies, to receive an 80% market share or to reach 60 million dollars. There are some game mechanic variations between the missions. For example, when playing to the first 60 million dollars, drilling a borehole takes longer than in the other missions.

There are eight oil-producing regions to choose from where players must acquire licenses, tankers and oil fields: Alaska, North America, Central America, South America, Europe, USSR, the Gulf region and Indochina.

The player can request an expert opinion of an oil field's probable yield before purchase. Once a field has been bought, the player may drill manually or pay game money for automatic drilling. Enemies in the game can disrupt play using sabotage. This can be done by igniting the oil fields, destroying tankers, manipulating balance sheets, etc. To protect against such moves, a player can hire a security company.

In the course of the game there are three action sequences. Oil sales can lead to delays, and the player must manually lay pipeline. Manual drilling requires the player to correct the deviation of the drill head. Finally, burning oil wells must be deleted using dynamite. The latter can be carried out by a specialist called "Ted Redhair" (inspired by the famous [[Red Adair]]).

They were founded on two different dates, Candler College in 1899 and Colegio Buenavista in 1920. They both ceased to exist in 1961 when they were nationalized by the revolutionary government of Fidel Castro.&lt;ref name=Evolution&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amigospais-guaracabuya.org/oagjc001.php|title=RELIGIOUS REPRESSION IN CUBA: Its Evolution and Present Status|access-date=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These schools intended to provide a bilingual education in Spanish and English, based on the Christian faith. They offered from the pre-school level until finishing high school to Cuban children and youth, as part of the mission of the church on the island.

Although they were administered by different dependencies of the Methodist Church of Florida (United States), these two schools developed all their activities in coordination. Candler College offered elementary education only to boys while Colegio Buenavista provided primary education for girls. Young girls enrolled in Buenavista attended secondary education programs at Candler College; they only received religion and physical education classes at the Buenavista facilities. Some of Candler's boys did the seventh and eighth grades in English at Colegio Buenavista to be able to follow the United States High School curriculum. The younger boys also went to Kindergarten along with the girls. Candler College had a boarding school for boys only. Similarly, Buenavista provided the boarding for young girls and ladies. The two schools had separate lunch services for students who did not live a short distance away from them.

In order to give its graduates and other students, the opportunity to continue university studies, at Candler College Candler University was organized in 1956, opening the Faculties of Pedagogy, Languages, Philosophy, and Letters, Pharmacy and Commercial Sciences to began in 1957.

These institutions grew in number of students and in prestige over the years until their educational work was interrupted in 1961 when the Castro regime nationalized all the private educational establishments (religious and lay).&lt;ref name=Evolution/&gt; During the years in which Candler College and Colegio Buenavista existed, both schools provided a successful service to Cuban youth preparing their students for civic life by providing, in addition to official instruction, an integral formation based on Christian, moral and patriotic values. 
==History==
[[File:Students. Colegio Buena Vista. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left]]
The first Methodist school in Cuba was founded in 1899 by the American missionary Thad E. Leland on Calle Virtudes de [[La Habana]]. This was founded when the Bishop of the Methodist Church of Florida, the Rev. Warren Akin Candler, proposed to give a new impetus to the missionary work begun in Cuba in 1883, through educational projects. In 1903 this school was named Candler College in honor of Bishop Candler.&lt;ref&gt;Tamayo Pérez, Marbelito y García Hernández, Belkis. Iglesia Metodista de Cuba. Reseña histórica 1883–2007. La Habana, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reverend H. B. Bardwell, a missionary in Cuba since 1903, succeeded the reverends E.E Clements and B.F. Gilbert as director of Candler College in 1909. Aware of the need to expand, the Mission Board of the Florida Conference acquired a vast tract of land in La Ceiba, Marianao, where the first building for the new headquarters was built in 1912 of the school, inaugurated in January 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Bardwell, Harry B. An epoch-making event. En [http://books.google.com/books?id=SoqaAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=leyland+%22candler+college%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8w2LiCZ2OQ&amp;sig=z3rRw6SmLEyVfFQc4xQCdcoxQeE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AjuATNG8H4OB8gaz4tzrAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; For some time, the school in Havana and the new headquarters functioned under the same name until they were organized as independent colleges. The headquarters of Havana was called Central Methodist College and that of Marianao retained the name Candler College. In addition to offering elementary and secondary education, between 1924 and 1946 at Candler College, a theological seminary was held, the School of Pastors, which was under the direction of the Reverend B. F. Gilbert followed by the Reverend E.E, Clements.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez Ramos, Carlos. ''Un resumen de los setenta años de labor de la iglesia metodista en Cuba.''  Libro publicado en 1983. No se indican ciudad ni editorial.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reverend Bardwell directed Candler College for forty years, during which the spirit of the college was consolidated. He was replaced in 1949 by the Reverend Carlos Pérez Ramos, who had been assistant director since 1946. Under his direction, the school continued to grow and other buildings and facilities were built to meet new requirements.

Colegio Buenavista was founded in 1920 by the Women's Missionary Board of the Methodist Church to provide a Christian education for girls and young women and to respond to the request of the parents of Candler College students who demanded an education for their daughters. quality similar to that of his brothers. This women's school began to operate in a residence surrounded by gardens that acquired the church across the street Miramar, along the side of the Candler.&lt;ref&gt;Haskin, Sarah Estelle.

Nashville,1923.  http://www.archive.org/stream/womenandmissions00haskuoft#page/160/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to offering primary education for girls, between 1926 and 1938 in Buenavista worked a Normal School that prepared hundreds of teachers, directed by Dr. Luis Alonso.

Until 1960, the directors of Colegio Buenavista were American missionaries who had carried out evangelization and social work for the Methodist Church in different parts of the island. Under his direction the school grew at the same pace as Candler College. Miss Belle Markey, the first director, was followed by Miss Junia Jones and then by Miss Ione Clay, who held the position for more than 25 years, until her retirement in 1956, and was replaced by Miss Juanita Kelly, who was succeeded by Miss Lorraine Buck. Four months before the nationalization of the school, the Reverend Humberto Carrazana, pastor of the Methodist Church of Marianao, was named director of Colegio Buenavista.&lt;ref name=Recuerdos&gt;{{cite news | first = Mercedes| last = Cil Rivero| title =Mis Recuerdos del Colegio Buenavista.| url = https://www.facebook.com/groups/candlercollege/doc/10150849356720693| via = Facebook | accessdate = November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For several decades, the schools were considered among the best in Cuba and "many graduates were accepted in the best universities in the United States without taking admission exams."&lt;ref name="Pérez Ramos_1"&gt;Pérez Ramos, Carlos. ''Un resumen de los setenta años de labor de la iglesia metodista en Cuba''.  Libro publicado en 1983.

==Location, buildings and facilities==
[[File:Areal View. Candler College and Colegio Buena Vista. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|]]
Candler College was located in the southeastern corner of the intersection of Miramar (Calle 54) and Gutiérrez (Ave. 43) in La Ceiba, Marianao. Candler's main entrance was down Gutiérrez Street (Ave.43) and gave access to the gardens in the front part of the main building, where the offices were on the ground floor and the bedrooms for the pupils in the second and third floors. Through this entrance, taking to the left, were the Martian Corner and the two-story building where the High School classes were held. At the back of this building, which opened onto Calle Lanuza (Calle 52), an entrance was opened for the students of Candler University. There were three other entrances on Calle Miramar (Ave. 54): one that was used to enter the Chapel, the next allowed the entrance of cars to the esplanade and parking place; this entrance had on the right the two-story building of the School of Commerce, with its well-equipped classrooms and spacious corridors, and to the left was the Library building, which also had two floors. Surrounding the esplanade were the back of the main building with its long corridors, the front of the High School building, the dining room and kitchen with the apartment for the director on the second floor and the three-story building that occupied the School of Baccalaureate, with its laboratories and the Museum of Natural Sciences, in addition to classrooms. Separated by a fence, was the field for sports, the squash court and beyond the ground and the ballpark. The third entrance was the building of the Elementary School, in front of Font Street (Ave. 45). On the opposite side of the street, there was another sports field on the corner of 54th Street and 45th Ave. The Gymnasium, with its modern wooden plank for playing basketball and indoor volleyball and a stage at the back, was It was located in the southwest corner of 56th Street and 45th Ave.
[[File:Buenavista a color.jpg|thumb|left|El edificio principal de Buenavista on 54th Street]]
Colegio Buenavista was located in front of the entrances on the side of Candler, on the southwestern corner of 54th Street and 43rd Avenue.&lt;ref name=Recuerdos/&gt;
The main Buenavista building had three entrances on Calle Miramar (Calle 54): the first was a gate to enter the main building, the beautiful mansion that was adapted to the initial needs of the school. On the ground floor were: the materials room, the kitchen, the dining room, and two classrooms. On the facade there were two converging stairs on a large terrace that gave access to the offices, the library, and the hall, from where a corridor led to the infirmary, the bedrooms and bathrooms for the pupils and the director, on the second floor.&lt;ref name=Recuerdos/&gt; On the third floor, there were more bedrooms for the older pupils and the missionaries. To the left of this building, there was an entrance for cars, gardens, a garage, and a small room. A hallway to the left led to the classrooms, lined along 54th Street and 45th Ave, which limited the large courtyard with its gardens. This included recreational areas, the platform for cultural activities, the Martian Corner and, on the other side, the tennis and volleyball court. A third entrance to the gardens of Calle Miramar led to a vestibule that separated a small religious meditation room and a classroom and the long corridor that gave access to the other classrooms. There was also an entrance through the back of the patio, on Calle Primelles (Calle 56). Crossing this street, a small door allowed to enter the sports ground for the students of Buenavista. The Auditorium of both schools was built next to this land, located in the south-western corner of 56th Street and 43rd Ave. Diagonal to this, in the northeast corner, with the entrance by Ave. 43, was the building of two stories with a smaller playground for students from pre-school to third grade.

Both schools in total occupied a vast lot whose area of more than 32,000 square meters was bounded by 45th Ave to the south, 52nd Street to the east, 58th Street to the west and 43rd Ave to the north. This large area was crossed by three streets: Calle 54, Ave. 45 and Calle 56, which separated the buildings of the schools and the sports grounds, the gymnasium, and the auditorium.

==Basics==
Candler College and Buenavista College were grounded in the creed and discipline of the Methodist church. They were opened to prepare students for their future life outside of school on the basis of Christian faith and practice as well as moral, civic and patriotic values. Its purposes were to provide a comprehensive education that would contribute to the personal development of students as individuals and members of society and raise the educational level of the newly founded republic.
===Methodist approach===
[[File:Candler College Chapel. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Candler College Chapel. Corner of 54th Street and 43rd Avenue]]
According to the thought of John Wesley, a good education was considered "one of the best ways to transform individuals, communities and societies as a whole" for their betterment and the glory of God. Education was not only the acquisition of academic knowledge but also wisdom and humility, which was founded on the teachings of Christ, in order to grow intellectually, personally and spiritually. The search for truth was encouraged through reason, research and debate, based on freedom of thought and expression. High academic standards were promoted as well as the development of talents through varied activities. As a result, challenges were posed to students, they were inspired and supported to achieve their best through self-discipline and a strong work ethic.

Candler and Buenavista maintained a distinctive approach to education that incorporated Christian ethical values. The Methodist Social Creed emphasizes interest in social welfare and justice as well as the need to combat prejudice and intolerance in whatever form they take by strengthening mutual respect and understanding.&lt;ref name="Pérez Ramos_1" /&gt; So tolerant attitudes and behaviors were reinforced, respectful and non-discriminatory.

It was hoped that students would learn to differentiate good and evil based on Christian and moral values. Family values based on love and mutual understanding and support were an important part of the formation of students.

High ideals of patriotism were present in the education of the students: love their homeland and be loyal to it, respect and honor the national emblems and recognize the merits of the main forgers of the nation, know its history, culture and traditions as well as the achievements of the newly created republic and interested in the needs and problems of its people and their efforts to solve them.

The civic values of freedom and democracy and the norms of coexistence related to rights and duties had a central place in the task of preparing future citizens as well as inculcating good manners and the appropriate habits required to live in society.

The strong ties with the Florida Methodist Church Conference, which partially supported both colleges, were evident in the influence of American culture and traditions in schools. The flag of the United States was present in all the parties and ceremonies along with the Cuban flag and the national anthems of the two countries were sung.

==Hymns and emblems==
The principle adopted by Candler College as a guide was Consilio et Prudentia (Wisdom and Prudence). The motto of Colegio Buenavista, which appears on his seal, was Esse quam Videri (Ser instead of appearing). The pennants of Candler College bore the distinctive colors of the school, red and black. Those of Buenavista the orange and the black. The hymns of the schools were the following:
[[File:Sello de Candler.jpg|thumb|left|Logo Candler College]]

==Academic structure==
[[File:Faculty. Candler College and Colegio Buena Vista. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|The Faculty]]
Candler College consisted of four schools, each coordinated by a sub-director:

* Elementary School, which included a pre-primary education degree and seven primary education grades (the latter was called preparatory). At the end of the sixth grade students could enter the Baccalaureate if they passed in any of the public secondary schools the official entrance exam that was required.
* Baccalaureate school, high school in Spanish, which comprised five years. In the latter, students could choose between two branches: Science and Letters. The students left prepared to continue studies of higher education in the different careers that were offered in the country at the university level.
* School of Commerce, consisting of two different branches: Accountant and Secretariat, which initially were programs of three years each. But from the course of 1957–58 Contador was extended to four years. Upon completion of studies in these programs, students were prepared to enter the world of work in commercial enterprises or where office work would be required.
* High School in English, which consisted of four years of secondary education that prepared the student to continue studies of higher education in the United States.

Colegio Buenavista offered preschool (Kindergarten and Pre-primary) and primary education in Spanish and English from first to eighth grades. Her students continued secondary education at Candler College.

The curriculum corresponded to the graduate school model adopted in Cuba at the beginning of the twentieth century, which implies the progressive nature of the teaching-learning process so that the contents of the [[Course (education)|subjects]] were sequenced progressively from pre-school to secondary education.

Candler College and Buenavista followed the official programs for the Primary School and the Bachillerato proposed by the Cuban Ministry of Education, which determined in a precise way the contents for the subjects of each grade in the Study Plans, as well as the time required for each one. The teachers selected the [[textbooks]] and the materials among those prepared by authors Cubans. Primary Education in Spanish and the Baccalaureate had official recognition, as there were supervisors from the Ministry of Education who periodically visited the primary school classes. The Baccalaureate School was incorporated the Secondary Education Institute of Marianao, so that the students had to present exams of each subject before professors of this institute twice a year to obtain the [[accreditation]] of their results, and at the end, the [[diploma]] official that would allow them to enter the university. In the School of Commerce the professors prepared the study plans. The textbooks and materials were selected by them among those offered by the publishing houses and were available in the [[bookstores]]. The curricula for the High School followed the curriculum of the United States and the texts were brought from there. The schedules, the spaces and the didactic resources were conceived and managed in coordination by the sub-directors and teachers. They were autonomous to conduct the teaching-learning process. Each teacher was free to choose the teaching methods and teaching materials he or she considered most convenient for each subject and was responsible for the [[evaluation]] of the students, including the [[observation]] of their difficulties and needs in order to improve their performance. Grades or grades were reported monthly to the parents of the students.

Religious education was important in both schools. The Bible classes were part of the curriculum in all grades. The students not only read the history and teachings of Jesus and the [[apostles]] in the [[New Testament]], they also learned about the history of the [[Hebrew people]], their leaders, [[prophets]], and other characters; they also learned the [[Ten Commandments]] and read the [[Psalms]] and [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] in the [[Old Testament]]. Worshiping God and [[praying]] were part of the student's formation. Twice a week the students of Buenavista and the boys of Candler in the Chapel met separately, where the word of God was preached and topics related to spiritual, moral, civic and patriotic values were discussed.

== Extracurricular activities ==
Students at both schools had opportunities to supplement their academic instruction through a number of sports and various extracurricular activities:
=== Sports ===
[[File:Deportes en Candler.jpg|thumb|left]]
Athletics and sports were always practiced in Candler. In the beginning, the favorite sports were tennis and baseball along with the [[training]] field and track. Later, students also practiced [[softball]], basketball, volleyball, and squash instead of tennis. Some students could participate in teams that were specially trained to compete in the intercollegiate championships. They won many trophies in baseball and basketball.

The girls also played sports at Buenavista: softball, kickball, volleyball and basketball. Teams were trained with the best players to also participate in intercollegiate competitions.

=== Music ===
In Buenavista there was a Music Department that, in addition to the regular music classes included in the curricula, offered piano and [[solfeggio]] and [[music theory]] lessons. The students could take these classes in their [[free time]] or at the end of the school day each day. The annual [[Recital]] was a tradition of many years, in which the students who took piano lessons played a piece of classical music. In this one also participated the Rhythmic Band.

In the decades of 1940 and 1950 there was also a school band that participated in stops or patriotic celebrations and played the National Anthem during the salute to the flag.

In addition, [[choirs]] were specially prepared to participate in [[festivals]] and other celebrations.

Since 1958 a choir was organized with students from both schools.

=== Other extracurricular activities ===
[[File:Colegio Buena Vista. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left]]
At different times, some groups of students interested in literature, musical appreciation, theater, [[Rhetoric|oratory]], or the publication of a newspaper were organized, guided by a teacher or counselor.

The [[excursions]] were traditional opportunities to visit places near the school or historical or recreational places in different parts of the country.

At Candler College, there was also a troop of [[Asociación de Scouts de Cuba|Boy Scouts]].

In addition, festivals, bazaars, theatrical performances, Christmas celebrations and others that were part of the annual planning of school activities were organized.

== Student body ==
Candler College and Colegio Buenavista were open to all children and young people without further requirements, who, apart from paying the monthly fee, committed to respecting their standards. Some students were scholarship two for the church and some parents got a reduction in the tuition for their children's education.

The two schools did not admit exclusively Methodist or Protestant students. The majority of the students were [[Catholic]] and there were also some students [[Jews]]. Due to the good level in the teaching of the English language, Candler and Buenavista were chosen by many parents of students [[Alien (law)|foreigners]]{{clarify|date=November 2018}} who lived in Cuba.

In the sixty-two years of existence of Candler College and forty-one of Buenavista, many thousands of students left the schools prepared to continue their studies or enter the world of work and become good citizens. They were equipped with solid foundations of religious faith and moral values to cope with life after school.

=== Alumni Associations ===

The Candler Fraternity was the association of graduates and alumni of Candler College. The former students of Buenavista belonged to the Association of Former Students of Colegio Buenavista.

Many alumni and teachers of Candler and Buenavista left their country in the early 1960s when the revolution that took power in 1959 turned to [[communism]]. Others emigrated later. The majority went to live in the United States, concentrating on the largest number in Florida. Some of those who have been in contact have met on different occasions to remember the old times and reaffirm the spirit of the schools that they all share.

The former students of Candler and Buenavista who remained in Cuba have formed the Candler-Buenavista Fraternity and meet annually since 1999.

}}'''Carl [[von]] Voit''' (31 October 1831 – 31 January 1908) was a [[Germany|German]] [[physiologist]] and [[dietitian]].
== Biography ==
Voit was born in [[Amberg]]. From 1848 to 1854 he studied at the universities of [[University of Munich|Munich]] and [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]]. At Munich, his teachers were [[Justus von Liebig]] and [[Max Joseph von Pettenkofer|Max Joseph Pettenkofer]], and at Würzburg, he was a pupil of [[Albert von Kölliker]]. In 1855 he furthered his education at the [[University of Göttingen]] under chemist [[Friedrich Wohler]], and in 1856/57 served as an assistant to [[Theodor Ludwig Wilhelm von Bischoff|Theodor von Bischoff]] in Munich. In 1857 he obtained his [[habilitation]], and from 1863 was a full professor of physiology as well as curator of the physiological collection at the University of Munich.&lt;ref&gt;[http://drw.saw-leipzig.de/31197 VOIT, Carl Michael von Voit] drw.saw-leipzig.de&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributions ==
Carl von Voit is considered by many to be the "father" of modern [[dietetics]]. As a [[chemist]] and physiologist, he found that the amount of [[nitrogen]] in excreted [[urea]] is a measure for the [[protein turnover]]. Using a [[respiration chamber]], he could characterize the significance of individual nutrients, known as ''Voitsche Kostmaß''.

He was also a successful teacher, attracting international students to the University of Munich and thus significantly influencing the US nutritionist, among others. One of his better known German pupils was [[Max Rubner]].

Carl von Voit died in [[Munich]].

The [[German Nutrition Society]] awards the Carl-von-Voit-medal since 1961.

'''Commercium songs''' are traditional academic songs that are sung during academic feasts: [[commercium]]s and [[tableround (University)|tableround]]s.

Some very old commercium songs are in [[Latin]], like ''[[Meum est propositum]]'' or ''[[Gaudeamus igitur]]''. 

In some countries, hundreds of commercium songs are compiled in commercium books.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2768">In 1957, the [[Ford Foundation]] began to explore the relationship between arts and American society. Resulting from a suggestion by [[Norman Dello Joio]], the Young Composers Project (YCP) was founded in 1959. Funded by the Ford Foundation and administered by the National Music Council, the project placed young composers (age 35 and under) in public school systems as composers-in-residence.

From 1959 to 1962, 31 composers participated in the project. They discovered that many music educators were not prepared to deal with contemporary music. In 1962 the YCP was elevated from a pilot program to one of the ten major projects of the Ford Foundation. The Music Educators National Conference ([[MENC: The National Association for Music Education|MENC]]) submitted a proposal to the Ford Foundation that the project be expanded to include seminars and workshops on contemporary music in the schools, and that pilot programs be established in public schools. In 1963 the Ford Foundation awarded MENC a grant of $1,380,000 to organize the Contemporary Music Project for Creativity in Music Education. YCP continued under the title Composers in Public Schools. By 1968, 46 more composers had been matched with public school systems.

One of the first activities of the Contemporary Music Project was the establishment of 16 workshops and seminars held at various colleges throughout the country to help teachers better understand contemporary music. Six pilot projects were established in schools, including the Baltimore, San Diego, and Farmingdale, New York systems.

In 1965 the Seminar on [[Comprehensive Musicianship]] was held at [[Northwestern University]]. Its purpose was to develop and implement means of improving the education of music teachers. In 1967 a symposium was held at Arlie House in Warrenton, Virginia to discuss means of evaluating Comprehensive Musicianship. The resultant document, ''Procedures for Evaluation of Music in Contemporary Education'', offers guidelines for the evaluation of techniques and attitudes acquired through comprehensive musicianship studies.

In 1968 the Ford Foundation gave MENC a grant of $1,340,000 to administer the Contemporary Music Project for an additional five years. MENC contributed $50,000 per year. From 1968 to 1973 the Contemporary Music Project consisted of three programs: Professionals-in-Residence to Communities, the Teaching of Comprehensive Musicianship, and Complementary Activities.

'''Data-driven learning''' (DDL) is an approach to foreign language learning. Whereas most language learning is guided by teachers and textbooks, data-driven learning treats language as data and students as researchers undertaking guided discovery tasks. Underpinning this pedagogical approach is the ''data - information - knowledge'' paradigm (see [[DIKW pyramid]]). It is informed by a [[pattern grammar | pattern-based approach]] to grammar and vocabulary, and a [[Lexicogrammar |lexicogrammatical]] approach to language in general. Thus the basic task in DDL is to identify patterns at all levels of language. From their findings, foreign language students can see how an aspect of language is typically used, which in turn informs how they can use it in their own speaking and writing. Learning how to frame language questions and use the resources to obtain data and interpret it is fundamental to [[learner autonomy|learner autonomy]]. When students arrive at their own conclusions through such procedures, they use their higher order thinking skills (see [[Bloom's taxonomy | Bloom's taxonomy]]) and are creating knowledge (see [[Lev Vygotsky|Vygotsky]]).     

In DDL, students use the same types of tools that professional linguists use, namely a [[text corpora|corpus]] of texts that have been sampled and stored electronically, and a [[concordance (publishing)|concordancer]], which is a search engine designed for linguistic analysis. Some tools have been specifically created for data-driven learning, such as [https://skell.sketchengine.co.uk/run.cgi/skell SkELL] and Micro-concord.

Micro-concord was the first significant software designed for classroom use. It was developed for the MS-DOS microcomputers by [[Tim Johns]] and [[Mike Scott]]{{dn|date=December 2018}} and published for DOS computers in 1993 by OUP. It evolved into the widely-used [[WordSmith_(software)|WordSmith Tools]].

Johns (1936 – 2009) pioneered data-driven learning and coined the term. It first appeared in an article, ''Should you be persuaded: Two examples of data-driven learning'' (1991) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Tim|last1=Johns|chapter=Chapter 2: Should you be persuaded: Two examples of data-driven learning|chapterurl=http://moodle.ils.uw.edu.pl/pluginfile.php/10011/mod_resource/content/2/Tim%20Johns%20and%20DDL.pdf|title=Classroom Concordancing|publisher=ELR|location=Birmingham|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;. His paper, ''From Printout to Handout,''&lt;ref&gt;Johns, Tim. "From Printout to Handout: Grammar and Vocabulary Teaching in the Context of Data-Driven Learning". ''ELR Journal'' (Birmingham), Vol. 4, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; is reprinted and discussed at length in Volume 2 of Hubbard's ''Computer-Assisted Language Learning''.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, Philip. ''Computer-Assisted Language Learning''. Routledge, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas' task-based ''Discovering English with Sketch Engine'' &lt;ref&gt;Thomas, James. ''Discovering English with Sketch Engine''. VERSATILE, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; exemplifies DDL and acknowledges Johns throughout. Other recent books on DDL which credit Johns as the originator of the approach include those by Anderson and Corbett (2009) &lt;ref&gt;Anderson, W., &amp; Corbett, J. Exploring English with online corpora. London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;, Reppen (2010) &lt;ref&gt;Reppen, R. ''Using corpora in the classroom''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;, Bennett (2010) &lt;ref&gt;Bennett, G. ''Using corpora in the language learning classroom: Corpus linguistics for teachers''. Michigan: University of Michigan Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;, Flowerdew (2102) &lt;ref&gt;Flowerdew, L. ''Corpora and language education''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;, Boulton and Tyne (2014) &lt;ref&gt;Boulton, A., &amp; H. Tyne. ''Des documents authentiques aux corpus: Démarches pour l’apprentissage des langues''. Paris: Didier, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;, and Friginal (2018). &lt;ref&gt;Friginal, E. ''Corpus linguistics for English teachers: Tools, online resources, and classroom activities''. Abingdon/New York: Routledge, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Johns worked at the English for Overseas Students Unit  of Birmingham University from 1971 till the end of his career. This was while [[John McHardy Sinclair|John Sinclair]] led a large team of linguists at Birmingham University working on the [[COBUILD]] project which delivered the first major corpus-based dictionaries and grammars of English for foreign students. COBUILD however, never tasked students with exploring language data themselves.

Johns' referred to his specific DDL approach as [[kibitzing]]: when he returned his students' written work, together they would explore the errors using corpus data.  A selection of these Kibbitzer tutorials are accessible on [http://www.lexically.net/TimJohns Mike Scott’s website]. 

Despite the widespread awareness of corpora among the major movers and shakers in foreign language teaching, 
DDL is not widely embraced by its practitioners. One of the main reasons for this is the incompatibility of views on language and language learning: traditional language teachers and textbooks have a [[Linguistic prescription| prescriptive]] view of language treating it as a system of rules to be memorised, engaging only lower order thinking skills. A [[Linguistic description|descriptive]] view of language permits the observation of language patterns and outliers that exist in language itself. DDL positions students to use higher order thinking skills to [[metacognition|learn how to learn]] to make and learn from their own observations. Such guided discovery leads to [[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy]] results, which are incompatible with prescriptive linguistics and teaching. 

There is a considerable body of research conducted into DDL as evidenced by the professional bodies, books, journal articles and conference presentations. [[TaLC]] (Teaching and Language Corpora) is a biennial conference that is a platform for corpus-based research that has a pedagogical focus. CorpusCALL [http://www.eurocall-languages.org/sigs/corpuscall-sig-homepage] is a special interest group within [[European Association for Computer-Assisted Language Learning|EuroCALL]] and is mostly active through its [https://www.facebook.com/groups/471206953085498 Facebook group]. The online teaching journal, [https://www.hltmag.co.uk Humanising Language Teaching] hosts a section called Corpus Ideas.

== History ==
The site was created by [[Richard Talens]] and [[Brian Wang]], two self-described computer nerds who had succeeded in improving their own fitness and decided that game mechanics could help others to do the same.&lt;ref name=GlobeAndMail /&gt;

Fitocracy launched in February 2011, using an invite system to control new user signups. Invite codes were initially distributed through sites such as [[Reddit]].&lt;ref name=TechCrunch&gt;{{cite web|last=Empson|first=Rip|title=Fitocracy Brings Games And Social To Your Workouts (Invites Within)|url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/28/fitocracy-brings-games-and-social-to-your-workouts-invites-within/|work=TechCrunch|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the site introduced advertising, along with a paid option, known as Fitocracy Hero, which was advertisement-free and offered additional features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing Fitocracy Hero| url=http://blog.fitocracy.com/post/12330516366/introducing-fitocracy-hero|work=Fitocracy Blog|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By then, Fitocracy claimed to have 120,000 users and a waiting list of a further 120,000.&lt;ref name=GlobeAndMail /&gt;

In January 2012, Fitocracy began a partnership with [[Red Bull]] in which the site would be used to host the Red Bull Fitness Challenge.&lt;ref name=RedBull&gt;{{cite web|title=Red Bull Fitness Challenge| url=http://fitness.redbullusa.com/fitocracy.php|work=Red Bull Fitness Challenge|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of January 2012, Fitocracy claimed a user base of 230,000 registered members.&lt;ref name="FitocracyPitch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fitocracy Presentation at 500Startups|url=http://www.livestream.com/500startups/video?clipId=pla_0c2f2ec1-cfc4-4987-a109-4ad04e6e4aec|work=500 Startups&amp;nbsp;— Fitocracy Presentation|accessdate=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Fitocracy launched an [[Mobile apps|app]] for [[iOS]] devices.&lt;ref name=iOSApp&gt;{{cite web|title=Fitocracy App|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fitocracy/id509253726?mt=8|work=[[iTunes Store]]|accessdate=2 July 2012|date=8 May 2012&lt;!--That is the 'Updated' column on the left side--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Fitocracy launched an app for [[Android (operating system)|Android]].

In March 2013, Fitocracy reached one million users&lt;ref name="1mUsers" /&gt; and also announced a collaboration with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], which challenges users to exercise for 15 minutes per day.&lt;ref name="1mUsers" /&gt;

In August 2014, Fitocracy was listed as one of [[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'s Best Websites of 2014.

== Game ==

Fitocracy users log their exercise activity by selecting from a collection of activities such as [[Olympic weightlifting|weight lifting]] or [[running]] and entering details such as weight lifted or distance run. Points are awarded based on the estimated fitness benefit of each activity. Users must reach points thresholds in order to ''[[Level (role-playing games)|level up]]''.&lt;ref name=TechCrunch /&gt;

=== Quests and achievements ===
The site presents users with ''[[Quest (gaming)|quests]]'' to perform for additional points, typically consisting of a set of related activities.&lt;ref name=GlobeAndMail /&gt; Particularly significant fitness milestones are recognized with [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievement]] badges.&lt;ref name=TechCrunch /&gt;

=== Social networking ===
In addition to the game, Fitocracy also provides a [[Social networking service|social network]] which enables users to 'follow' other users, view and comment on their workouts and join groups for specific interests.&lt;ref name=GlobeAndMail /&gt;

== Reception ==

Fitocracy was initially covered by technology and gaming focused media, such as [[Tech Crunch]],&lt;ref name=TechCrunch /&gt; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'',&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite web|last=Calderone|first=Emily|title=Train Like a Gamer|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/video/slate_v/2011/10/fitocracy_reviewed_an_app_that_helps_you_get_in_shape_video_.html|work=Slate|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lifehacker]], where it won a vote for 'Most Popular Fitness Tracking Site',&lt;ref name=Lifehacker&gt;{{cite web|last=Henry|first=Alan|title=Most Popular Fitness Tracking Web Site: Fitocracy|url=http://lifehacker.com/5842058/most-popular-fitness-tracking-web-site-fitocracy/|work=Lifehacker|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kotaku]]'',&lt;ref name=Kotaku&gt;{{cite web|last=Good|first=Owen|title=My Workout Partner is a Role-Playing Game|url=http://kotaku.com/5804310/my-workout-partner-is-a-role+playing-game|work=Kotaku|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Destructoid]]''.&lt;ref name=Destructoid&gt;{{cite web|last=Chester|first=Nick|title=Get in shape with game-like Fitocracy|url=http://www.destructoid.com/get-in-shape-with-game-like-fitocracy-202436.phtml|work=Destructoid|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it grew, it was covered by more mainstream media, including ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'',&lt;ref name=PopularMechanics&gt;{{cite news|last=Herrman|first=John|title=4 Great Apps to Game-ify Your Life|newspaper=Popular Mechanics|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Observer]]'',&lt;ref name=BetaBeat /&gt; [[CNN]],&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Jacque|title=Why gamers are a great fit at the gym By Jacque Wilson, CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/14/health/video-gamers-bodybuilders-fitocracy/|work=CNN|accessdate=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes /&gt; and ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.&lt;ref name=GlobeAndMail /&gt;

'''Gamaliel Foundation''' provides training and consultation and develops national strategy for its affiliated congregation-based community organizations.  As of 2013, Gamaliel has 45 affiliates in 17 [[U.S. states]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[South Africa]], and claims to represent over a million people.

==History==
The Gamaliel Foundation was founded in [[Chicago]] in 1968 to assist the Contract Buyers League, which worked to assist [[African-American]] home buyers in the city’s [[Neighborhoods of Chicago|West Side]]. Gamaliel was reoriented to focus on [[community organizing]] when Gregory Galluzzo was hired as executive director in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Mazullo, "Organizing for Regional Equity," ''Poverty &amp; Race'', September/October 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;   Seeing its basic function as training and developing leaders in low-income communities, Gamaliel’s goal is "to assist local community leaders to create, maintain and expand independent, [[grassroot]]s, and powerful faith-based community organizations"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Statement|url=http://www.gamaliel.org/Foundation/default.htm|accessdate=2008-08-30|publisher=Gamaliel Foundation|year=2008|work=Gamaliel Foundation website |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080616052800/http://www.gamaliel.org/Foundation/default.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; that have the power to influence political and economic decisions that impact cities and regions.   The name "[[Gamaliel]]" refers to the Biblical wise man who was a teacher to [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] (see [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 5:38-39; and Acts 22:3), whom [[Saul Alinsky]] considered to be the first great congregation-based organizer.

Gamaliel Foundation works in the community organizing tradition of Alinsky, who began his work in Chicago with the Back of the Yards Neighborhood Council in 1939.  Following Alinsky’s death in 1972, his [[Industrial Areas Foundation]], under executive director [[Edward T. Chambers]], moved toward a congregation-based organizing model, emphasizing training and leadership development.  Gamaliel has developed along a similar path under the direction of Galluzzo, a former [[Roman Catholic]] priest who got his introduction to community organizing in the early 1970s in Chicago, where he worked with the Pilsen Neighborhood Community Council, mentored by such organizers as [[Tom Gaudette]] and John Baumann (the founder of [[PICO National Network]]).

==Governance==
Gamaliel’s board of directors has 15 members, and is the ultimate governing authority for the organization, setting policy and overseeing management.  The board and staff are advised by the National Clergy Caucus, the African American Leadership Commission, and the International Leadership Assembly.  Gamaliel operates with a small staff (approximately 20 in 2008), supplemented by interns and consultants.  For example, during the period [[Barack Obama]] worked as a community organizer with the [[Developing Communities Project]] on the far [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] of Chicago (1985-1988), he was also a consultant and trainer for the Gamaliel Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Obama, "Why Organize?" in ''After Alinsky'', p. 36: "He has also been a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation, an organizing institute working throughout the Midwest."&lt;/ref&gt;  Gamaliel has five regional directors covering the Eastern, Mideastern, Midwestern, Southern, and Western United States.   Affiliated organizations are incorporated separately, raise their own funds, and employ their own organizers.  Ana Garcia Ashley became the executive director of Gamaliel in January 2011.

==Current program==
Gamaliel has refocused its efforts from neighborhood organizations to coalitions that can influence wider metropolitan areas and regions.&lt;ref&gt;Swarts, ''Organizing Urban America'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gamaliel has begun to formulate strategies for impacting national policy on such issues as comprehensive [[immigration reform]], [[health care]] for all, jobs and [[full employment]], [[affordable housing]], and equal access [[public transportation]] systems. The [[Transportation Equity Network]] (TEN) is a Gamaliel project.  To date, the major focus of Gamaliel has been such metropolitan areas as Chicago, [[St. Louis]], [[Cleveland]], [[Detroit]], [[Northwest Indiana]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Minneapolis]], and [[Kansas City, Missouri]].  Gamaliel’s long-range plan is to build a metropolitan organization in every major population area in the United States over the next ten years, including raising the necessary money and recruiting the 200 professional organizers essential to reach this goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gamaliel Foundation Strategic Plan |url=http://www.gamaliel.org/Foundation/goals.htm |accessdate=2008-08-30 |publisher=Gamaliel Foundation |year=2008 |work=Gamaliel Foundation website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829140105/http://www.gamaliel.org/Foundation/goals.htm |archivedate=August 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
Gamaliel conducts one-week national leadership trainings three times a year in the United States and once a year in South Africa.  A three-day advanced training is held annually for leaders who have attended the seven-day national training.  A three-day pastors training is offered for leaders who pastor churches.  Each December Gamaliel holds a three-day staff training retreat for all the organizers in its network.  Gamaliel also conducts numerous half-day, full-day, and weekend trainings for local communities.  Ntosake ("she who walks with lions and carries her own things") is a year-long Gamaliel women’s empowerment and leadership development program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gamaliel Training |url=http://www.gamaliel.org/Registration/TrainingForLeaders.htm |accessdate=2008-08-30 |publisher=Gamaliel Foundation |year=2008 |work=Gamaliel Foundation website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829132959/http://www.gamaliel.org/Registration/TrainingForLeaders.htm |archivedate=August 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Themes of Gamaliel trainings include such topics as "the world as it is" versus "the world as it should be," engaging the public arena, principles of congregation-based community organizing, power, self-interest, "one-on-one" [[relational meeting]]s as a building block of organizing, agitation, metropolitan organizing, and building and sustaining an organization.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, ''Doing Justice'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hildegart Rodríguez.jpg|thumb|250px|Hildegart Rodríguez.]]
'''Hildegart Rodríguez Carballeira''' (December 9, 1914 in [[Madrid]] &amp;ndash; June 9, 1933 in [[Madrid]]) was an activist for [[socialism]] and [[sexual revolution]], born and raised by her mother as a model for the woman of the future. She spoke 6 languages [[wunderkind|when eight years old]], finished law school as a teenager, and was a leader of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] and afterward of the [[Federal Party (Spain)|Federal Party]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} By the time she was 17 years old and had become internationally known, her mother shot her to death.

==Childhood==
{{or-section|date=March 2013}}
Hildegart was conceived in  [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] by [[Aurora Rodríguez Carballeira]] and an undisclosed biological father chosen by her mother with [[Eugenics|eugenic]] intentions. When she was sure she was pregnant, she moved to [[Madrid]], where Hildegart was born. Aurora set a clock to wake herself up every hour, allowing her to change her sleep position so blood could irrigate the [[fetus]] uniformly.

Her birth certificate and baptism act says: Hildegart Leocadia Georgina Hermenegilda Maria del Pilar Rodriguez Carballeira, but she only used her first name.&lt;ref name="El Correo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=BENITO|first1=CARLOS|title=Sangre de su sangre. El Correo|url=http://www.elcorreo.com/vizcaya/20101203/mas-actualidad/sociedad/sangre-sangre-201012031032.html|accessdate=13 April 2018|work=www.elcorreo.com|agency=El Correo|publisher=DIARIO EL CORREO|date=3 December 2010|language=SPANISH}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of Aurora's [[atheism]] and opposition to birth registration, she baptised (late) the girl on 23 March and registered on 29 April. Her mother used to explain that Hildegart meant "Garden of Wisdom" in German, but there's no basis to that, the name was either an invention or an alternative spelling of the Nordic/German name [[Hildegard]].

According to later research by Rosa Cal, her father was a brilliant military [[chaplain]], Alberto Payás.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

In June 1928, at age 13½, Hildegart enrolled in the School of Law of the [[Complutense University of Madrid]]. She later gave lessons at its School of Philosophy during the [[Second Spanish Republic]].

==The sexual revolution==
Hildegart was one of the most active people in the Spanish movement for [[sexual revolution|sex reformation]].
She was connected to the European vanguard, corresponding with [[Havelock Ellis]], whom she translated, and [[Margaret Sanger]].
In the foundation of the [[Spanish League for the Sexual Reform]], presided by Dr [[Gregorio Marañón]], she was chosen secretary without opposition.

She had correspondence with many other European personalities, accompanying [[Herbert George Wells]] in his visit to Madrid, but rejecting his offer to go to London as his secretary.
This offer by Wells, who wanted her to develop fully out of the influence of her mother, furthered the persecution ideas of Aurora.

==Death==
There were several hypotheses about the cause of the murder. Hildegart may have fallen in love. She intended to separate from her mother who, out of [[paranoia]], threatened suicide. Aurora's explanation was that "the sculptor, after discovering a minimal imperfection in his work, destroys it." She shot her daughter twice in the head and twice in the heart{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} (three shots to the head and one to the heart, according to Spanish Wikipedia) (one shot to the head and three to the heart, according to Giles Tremlett's Ghosts of Spain).

She was sentenced to 26 years, but was later transferred to a mental institution in [[Ciempozuelos]], Madrid, where she died in 1955.

Rather than counting errors, a paper is judged holistically if it has too many or too few errors to merit a 1, 2 or 3, compared to an [[anchor paper]], or if it meets a writing standard.

[[File:Model International Certificate for Operators of Pleasure Craft.jpg|thumb|250px|Specimen of an International Certificate for Operators of Pleasure Craft in accordance with Resolution No. 40 of the UN/ECE Working Party on Inland Water Transport.]]
[[File:CPI fr verso.jpg|thumb|250px|[[France]] specimen of an International Certificate.]]
An '''International Certificate of Competence''' ('''ICC''') is a certificate, which may be issued to anyone who has successfully completed certain ''national boating licenses'' or has passed an ''examination'' to prove the necessary competence for [[pleasure craft]] operation.

Persons wishing to be tested in the United Kingdom need to be tested by an approved ICC test centre 

Although only guaranteed to be accepted in countries that have adopted the relevant UN Resolution, the ICC is a useful document to carry and will generally be accepted where proof of competence is required.

In very general terms an ICC is required for the inland waterways of [[Europe]] and for inland and coastal waters of [[Mediterranean Countries|Mediterranean countries]]. For the coastal waters of [[Northern Europe]] the ICC is generally  not required, however to all of these generalisations there are exceptions.

==Description of the ICC==

The ICC is a product of the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] Inland Water Committee (UN ECE IWC) Resolution 40 (hereafter called Resolution 40).&lt;ref name="res40"&gt;{{cite web
|title=International Certificate for Operators of Pleasure Craft - Resolution No. 40, Revision 3
|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/doc/2013/sc3wp3/ECE-TRANS-SC3-147-rev3e.pdf 
|work=ECE/TRANS/SC.3/147/Rev.3
|date=2012-10-12
|publisher=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, Inland Transport Committee, Working Party on Inland Water Transport
|location=New York and Geneva
|accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This states that the ICC may be issued by a government of one state to its nationals and residents who may be on the waters of a foreign state, on condition that both accept the requirements and conditions set out in Resolution 40.

Governments may appoint competent authorities to issue ICC on their behalf. Globally [[International Yacht Training Worldwide]] (IYT) has been delegated such authority by both Ireland and the UK, and the [[Royal Yachting Association]] (RYA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noonsite.com/Members/val/R2011-04-04-1 Some Good News Regarding the International Certificate of Competence]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[British Sub-Aqua Club]] (BSAC) are both authorized by the UK.
    
The ICC provides documentary assurance from one government to another that the holder meets the levels of competence laid down in Resolution 40. However, the acceptance of Resolution 40 is often caveated.

==History of the ICC==

The origins of the ICC arose from navigation on the [[Rhine]] and the [[Danube]] ([[Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine]]) and the need for reassurance that vessel operators were competent to ensure safety of navigation and protection of the environment as they moved from one country to another. As a result, on 29 January 1979, the United Nations Working Party on Inland Water Transport adopted '''Resolution 14''', which recommended the introduction of a European document for an International Certificate (International Card) to provide those assurances.&lt;ref name="res14"&gt;{{cite web
|title=International Certificate (International Card) Concerning the Competence of Pleasure Craft Operators - Resolution No. 14, revised
|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/doc/finaldocs/sc3/TRANS-SC3-131e.pdf
|work=Compendium of resolutions of the Principal Working Party on Inland Water Transport, TRANS/SC.3/131
|date= 29 January 1979
|page=27
|publisher= United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, Inland Transport Committee, Working Party on Inland Water Transport
|accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Resolution was also intended to facilitate 'waterborne tourism'.  Until then operators could well have been expected to produce competency certificates for each country whose waters they were on.

In the mid-nineties, the Working Group on Inland Water Transport considered that Resolution 14 needed updating and strengthening and on 16 October 1998 the Working Party adopted their revisions as Resolution 40; this replaced Resolution 14.

The ''International Certificate for Operators of Pleasure Craft'' created in Resolution 40 is now more commonly referred to as the ''International Certificate of Competence'' or simply ''ICC''. The ICC is only applicable where the visited state has also adopted or recognises the ICC as a valid standard of competency.

==Application of the ICC==

Resolution 40 not only included operators of pleasure craft bound for or on the inland and coastal waters of foreign states but specifically included bareboat charter vessels. Significantly, it also set out the nautical, regulatory and technical competency requirements to be achieved and a minimum age (16 years of age) for the issue of an ICC irrespective of individual national schemes.

It is the professional opinion of the UNECE IWC that the standards set out in Resolution 40 provide a reasonable and appropriate level of competence for day sailing with due regard to the safety of navigation and crew and the protection of the environment. It is strongly recommended that governments recognise this rather than be drawn into discussions on where the ICC may or may not fit into their own national schemes – much the same as acceptance of the [[International Driving Permit|international driving licence]].

As of 2013 only 22 countries have adopted either resolution so far, of which 16 are [[European Union|EU]] [[Member state of the European Union|member states]]. In reality many countries choose to accept the ICC even though they have not adopted the resolution – but of course this is on their terms and can be subject to local variations. [[Spain]], [[Greece]] and [[Portugal]], for example, have not adopted Resolution 40 but are still most likely to ask visitors for an ICC. In reality, the ICC is more widely accepted as proof of the holder’s competence than adoption of Resolution 40 would suggest.&lt;ref name="ryaref"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rya.org.uk/infoadvice/boatingabroad/icc/Pages/icc.aspx | title = About the ICC / The ICC and Proof of Competence Abroad / Boating Abroad / Information &amp; Advice | accessdate = 2010-10-10 | date = 2010-08-03 | publisher = RYA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation of Resolution 40===
The following [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|UNECE]] member states have adopted Resolution 40 and thus officially accept the ICC as a proof of competence in their territories:&lt;ref name="res40" /&gt;

[[Austria]],
[[Belarus]],
[[Belgium]],
[[Bulgaria]],
[[Croatia]],
[[Czech Republic]],
[[Finland]],
[[Germany]],
[[Hungary]],
[[Ireland]],
[[Lithuania]],
[[Luxembourg]],
[[Netherlands]],
[[Norway]],
[[Romania]],
[[Slovakia]],
[[South Africa]] (not a member state),
[[Switzerland]] and
the [[United Kingdom]].

===Implementation of Resolution 14===
The following UNECE member states have adopted the earlier Resolution 14. Also these countries accept the ICC:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.unece.org/trans/main/sc3/sc3res.html
|title=Application of United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Resolutions relating to Inland Navigation
|format=PDF
|at=See item ''Annual report on the acceptance of the resolutions''
|accessdate=2013-11-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[France]],
[[Italy]] and
[[Poland]].

===States that have not adopted Resolution 40===
The following UNECE member states have not accepted the Resolution 40 nor the  Resolution 14:

Greece,
[[Moldova]],
Portugal,
Spain,
[[Russian Federation]],
[[Serbia]],
[[Sweden]],
[[Ukraine]] and
[[United States]].

==Individual states==

===Finland===
Finland has adopted the resolution but does not require the ICC for normal yachts ("sufficient age and skill" is enough) and does not use [[CEVNI]] for its inland waters.

Some official and some quality assured non-official certificates (mainly the coastal master certificates of the navigation association and the scouts) are regarded as fulfilling knowledge requirements of ICC for coastal waters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veneily.fi/sv/sjomanskap/behorighet Trafi: Internationellt behörighetsbrev för förare av fritidsbåt]&lt;/ref&gt; Courses for the CEVNI part are arranged separately by many organisations. The certificate itself is issued by the authorities, usually based on such documents.

The ICC is required for masters of boats chartered manned for international voyages (in addition to a domestic certificate) and for masters of recreational vessels with length more than 24 metres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/sv/laki/ajantasa/2009/20091687 Lag om fartygspersonal och säkerhetsorganisation för fartyg (29.12.2009/1687)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
[[International Yacht Training Worldwide|IYT Worldwide]] is authorized by the [[Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport|Irish Department of Transport]] to issue ICCs to any nationality provided they meet the knowledge and competency standards required. The [[Irish Sailing Association]] is authorized by the [[Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport|Irish Department of Transport]]. Uniquely, IYT Worldwide has been approved by the Irish Government to issue ICC s to any qualified applicants of any nationality on their behalf. 
The ICC enables owners  vessels to use them in those European waters where an ICC is required, and proves to local authorities that the skipper has the required Irish qualifications for skippering the vessel.

===United Kingdom===
[[International Yacht Training Worldwide]] (IYT Worldwide), The [[Royal Yachting Association]] (RYA),  and the [[British Sub-Aqua Club]] (BSAC) are with the authority of the [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] (MCA) approved to issue ICCs to those who meet the mandated requirements and the competency requirements.

ICC's are able to be issued by these Associations to citizens of Nations who are not signatories. In this manner, for example, USA citizens can gain the ICC. In the USA, NauticEd International Sailing Education facilitates the issuance of the ICC through the UK government via the Royal Yachting Association.

UK ICCs are for use on British registered vessels in the waters of foreign states that participate in Resolution 40, without the need to comply with those states’ national certification requirements. An ICC does not enable a British ICC holder to skipper a non-British registered vessel. If a British skipper wants to skipper a non-British registered vessel then he/she must be qualified per the regulations of the country in which the vessel is registered.

The UK ICC was only available to British citizens or bona fide British residents.This has now been extended to cover other Nationals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14655">The '''International Physicists' Tournament''' (IPT) is a physics competition for undergraduate students, bachelors or master level (or equivalent), in which students representing their nation and institution have typically 9 months to solve a set of challenging unsolved physics problems, then present and defend them to other teams &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IPT – International Physicists' Tournament |url=http://www.iptnet.info |website=iptnet.info |accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The tournament originated in [[Ukraine]] in 2009 between the Ukraine and the [[Russian Federation]], but, it has since grown to encompass numerous countries spanning multiple continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=David|first1=Larousserie|title=Joutes physiques|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2015/01/12/joutes-physiques_4554585_1650684.html|accessdate=7 April 2017|agency=Le Monde|language=French|date=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially inspired by the [[International Young Physicists' Tournament]] (IYPT) and follows a similar model. Undergraduates may be accompanied by team leaders, who are usually academic research staff or doctoral research students.

==Description==
Teams of up to 6 students are provided with a list of 17 problems which require a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches to their solution. The problems often have no exact solution and are not described directly in the scientific literature &lt;ref name="IPT-EJP"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vanovskiy |first1=Vladimir |title=International Physicists’ Tournament—the team competition in physics for university students |journal=European Journal of Physics |date=1 November 2014 |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=064003 |doi=10.1088/0143-0807/35/6/064003 |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0143-0807/35/6/064003/meta}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Teams may also be accompied by up to two team leaders (usually academic teachers, researchers or students), as well as supporting guests. A typical round in the tournament sees one team acting as a reporter, another acting as an opponent and a third acting as a reviewer. Under special circumstances a fourth team may also be present, which acts purely as an observer. After each round, the teams change roles and repeat until each team has played each role.  Each of these roles is outlined below.

=== The Reporter ===
The goal of the reporter is to present their solution to the problem challenged by the opponent. The reporter ideally presents a solution that contains both a theoretical and experimental treatment of the chosen problem. The presentation should include an outline which helps the audience to develop a good physical intuition for the problem.

The reporting team must also be able to defend their solution against criticism. This criticism is provided by the other teams and by a panel of judges called 'the jury' during the discussion that follows the reporting team's presentation.

=== The opponent ===
The opponent's job is to challenge the reporter to present their solution to one of the 17 initial problems. The goal of the opponent is to find the pros and cons of the reporter's solution and to present their critique it in a short review at the end or the reporters presentation. During this critique, the opponent must suggest the topics that will be the focus of subsequent discussion between the reporting and opposing teams.

=== The reviewer ===
The goal of the reviewer is to give a brief review of the reporter and opponent presentations. They must then discuss and highlight the main ideas that emerged as a result of this discussion while also highlighting any points that the two teams may have overlooked. Although the reviewer can ask questions to the reporter and opponent and take part in the discussion about the problems, their main role is to help the two other teams to reach a consensus and agree on what has been done and what more could be done to solve the problem.

=== The observer ===
When more than three teams are present, a fourth role is used - that of the observer. The observing team simply watches the round, but cannot participate in any of the discussions.

=== The jury ===
The jury is made up of a panel of senior academics and members of the IPT international organising committee. Their role is to provide a grade from 1-10 for each team and should be one which reflects each team's performance during the round. The grades are awarded based on a series of guidelines which vary for each role (Reporter, Opponent or Reviewer). However, there is a certain level of subjectivity when it comes to awarding the marks and each jury member is encouraged to use his/her discretion when applying the guidelines.

== Organisation ==

The tournament is represented by the International Organising Committee (IOC), which comprises representatives from each of the participating countries as well as the executive committee (also shortened to execom). The tournament is continuously managed by an executive committee composed of PhD and academic researchers and teachers from numerous participating countries. The committee is in charge of the likes of; problem selection, year round communication to participants, maintenance of the website and outreach, maintaining and improving the rules and executing the decisions made by the representatives of the countries part of the IPT. On the local level of the tournament, a Local Organising Committee (LOC) from the host institution and the IOC organises the tournament. The execom, and by extension the IPT, is headed by a president voted by the country representatives once every two years. The current president of the IPT is David Collomb &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=David |first1=Collomb |title=Organizing Committees – IPT |url=http://iptnet.info/organizing-committees/ |website=iptnet.info |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The other required posts include the secretary, treasurer and the vice-president. It is important to note that the execom has no voting power.

=== National Selections and pre-selection ===

Should more than one institution per country a apply, the participating country should organise a national selection process. This is organised by the IOC member representing the country and ideally follows the format of the international competition using a subset of the 17 problems chosen. Often the winner of these national selections will hold the country's spot in the final tournament. Should the number of countries registering for the tournament outweigh the number of places available (currently 21), a pre-selection process will be engaged. This pre-selection - or qualification - requires teams registered to submit a report on a one of a subset of the problems. The reports are graded by peer review from various academic research staff and then a rank is drawn to determine which nation's teams will qualify for the final tournament.

=== During the tournament ===

The tournament is composed of selective fights (usually four) and a final fight. Every team competes in all the selective fights, but only the three (or four) teams with the largest number of marks after the selective fights take part in the final.

Each fight involves three (or four) teams competing against each other in three (or four) rounds. During each round, these teams will act as either Reporter, Opponent or Reviewer (and Observer, if the group contains four teams). The teams then rotate around each of the roles until each team has played each role.

=== After the tournament ===

Up to a maximum of two weeks following the previous tournament, suggestions for the next edition's problems are open to the public. Once enough suggested problems have been collected, a committee of academic researchers associated with the IPT gather and form a shortlist of problems for members of participating countries to assign up to 100 points per country to problems. The problems are then ranked by points and re-assessed by the committee, before being released to the public.

== History ==
=== Original Logo ===
[[File:IPT-01.png|thumb|Old logo of the international physicists' tournament]]
The first logo of the International Physicists' Tournament consisted of a collage representing the different fields of physics. The general outline represent electron orbits around a [[coat of arms]]. Six symbols placed in the orbit lobs represents (clockwise) [[Atomic physics]], [[Crystallography]], [[Classical mechanics]], [[Thermodynamics]], [[Electromagnetism]] and [[Optics]]. Two [[wand]]s crossing over the arm of coats symbolises the confrontation during the Physics Fights. Finally, a ribbon is laid across the logo with the letters IPT imprinted in the middle.

'''Isfahan University of Art''' ('''AUI''') ({{lang-fa|دانشگاه هنر اصفهان}}) is a public [[University]] in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], [[Iran]]. It operated under the name of "Farabi University" before 1978, then it became a campus of the University of Art (based at Art University in [[Tehran]]). It was separated and became independent in 1999. The university owns some of the greatest houses in Isfahan, mostly of the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid period]]. The university's buildings are spread out over the city, most of which are old historic sites such as Tohid Khaane Building, David House, Martha Peters House, Haratian House, Sookiaas House, Haghighi House, France School and Ayyoubi and Melal House.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2969">Located in West Side [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], [[Minnesota]] at Baker Center, the '''Jane Addams School for Democracy''' was an organization dedicated to the ideals of [[democracy]] and [[citizenship]].  In an environment that seeks to embody the principles of [[democratic education]], recent [[immigrants]] and college students from the surrounding community come together to benefit from one another's experiences.  This was accomplished through cultural exchanges that take place in several learning circles, where each circle represents a major [[language]] other than [[English language|English]] that is spoken by the participants.  Over time, the Jane Addams School expanded to hold four such learning circles: [[East Africa]]n, [[Hmong language|Hmong]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and another for Children. The school was administered by the Center for Democracy and Citizenship at the University of Minnesota which moved to Augsburg College in 2009 and was renamed the Sabo Center for Democracy and Citizenship &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.augsburg.edu/sabo/|title=Sabo Center for Democracy and Citizenship - Sabo Center for Democracy and Citizenship|website=Sabo Center for Democracy and Citizenship|accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The program closed in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.augsburg.edu/sabo/2016/12/27/jane-addams-school-democracy-comes-close/|title=Jane Addams School for Democracy comes to a close - Sabo Center for Democracy and Citizenship|date=27 December 2016|website=Augsburg.edu|accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While much of the work at Jane Addams School was focused on language and citizenship, the school engaged in all issues that affect the lives of its participants through public work initiatives that include neighborhood art and theater projects with children, efforts to improve [[education]] at local schools, a community wellness project, and work with immigrants on new policy initiatives for citizenship, [[health care]], [[transportation]], and [[House|housing]].

==Philosophy==
Taking inspiration from the [[Chicago]] [[Hull House]] founded by the sociologist [[Jane Addams]], the Jane Addams School for Democracy seeks to create an environment where [[immigrants]] and college students mutually learn from one another in the spirit of democracy, citizenship, and public work.  The School lists its values as including the belief that everyone is a [[teacher]] and everyone is a learner, all [[cultures]] should be honored, adults and children learn together, citizenship means making contributions to the community, and changes occur when people work together.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11755">In the field of [[pedagogy]], '''learning by teaching''' (German: ''Lernen durch Lehren'', short '''LdL''') is a method of teaching in which students are made to learn material and prepare [[lesson]]s to teach it to the other students. There is a strong emphasis on acquisition of [[life skills]] along with the subject matter. This method was originally defined by [[Jean-Pol Martin]] in the 1980s.

The method of having students teach other students has been present since antiquity.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus&gt;{{cite news |last1=Heinrich |first1=Christian |title=Learning by Teaching: The Goal is Independence |url=http://www.goethe.de/ges/spa/prj/sog/mud/en3913352.htm |work=Goethe-Institut |date=November 2007 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most often this was due to lack of resources.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;  For example, the [[Monitorial System]] was an education method that became popular on a global scale during the early 19th century. It was developed in parallel by  Scotsman [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]] who had worked in [[Madras]] and [[Joseph Lancaster]] who worked in London; each attempted to educate masses of poor children with scant resources by having older children teach younger children what they had already learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graves |first1=Frank Pierrepont |title=A Student's History of Education |date=1915 |publisher=Macmillan Company |pages=239ff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPQTAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA239 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic research into intentionally improving education, by having students learn by teaching began in the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gartner |first1=Alan |last2=Kohler |first2=Mary Conway |last3=Riessman |first3=Frank |title=Children teach children; learning by teaching |date=1971 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York |isbn=0-06-013553-0 |edition= 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, [[Jean-Pol Martin]] systematically developed the concept of having students teach other in the context of learning [[French language|French]] as a [[foreign language]], and he gave it a theoretical background in numerous publications.&lt;ref name=Safiye/&gt;  The method was originally resisted, as the German educational system generally emphasized discipline and rote learning.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;  However the method became widely used in Germany in secondary education, and in the 1990s it was further formalized and began to be used in universities as well.&lt;ref name=Safiye&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Safiye |first1=Aslan, |title=Is Learning by Teaching Effective in Gaining 21st Century Skills? The Views of Pre-Service Science Teachers. |journal=Educational Sciences: Theory and Practice |date=October 5, 2015 |volume=15 |issue=6 |url=https://eric.ed.gov/?q=EJ1101263 |language=en |issn=1303-0485}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2008 Martin had retired, and although he remained active [[Joachim Grzega]] took the lead in developing and promulgating LdL.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;&lt;ref name=JPMabout&gt;{{cite web |title=About me |url=https://jeanpol.wordpress.com/about-me/ |publisher=Jean-Pol Martins Weblog |accessdate=10 June 2018 |language=de-DE |date=11 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
[[File:Learning by teaching phases.png|thumb|left|LDL, modeled on the structure of the brain by Martin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kahl |first1=von Reinhard |title=Treibhäuser der Zukunft wie in Deutschland Schulen gelingen ; eine Dokumentation |date=2005 |publisher=Archiv der Zukunft [u.a.] |location=Berlin |isbn=3-407-85830-2 |edition= 2nd, überarb. Aufl.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
After preparation by the teacher, students become responsible for their own learning and teaching. The new material is divided into small units and student groups of not more than three people are formed.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;

Students are then encouraged to experiment to find ways to teach the material to the others. Along with ensuring that students learn the material, another goal of the method, is to teach students [[life skills]] like respect for other people, planning, problem solving, taking chances in public, and communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thimm |first1=Katja |title="Guten Morgen, liebe Zahlen" |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-23011324.html |work=Der Spiegel |date=1 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kahl |first1=Reinhard |title=Unterricht: Schüler als Lehrer |url=https://www.zeit.de/online/2008/43/schueler-lehrer |work=Zeit |date=October 22, 2008 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stollhans |first1=S. |editor1-last=Corradini |editor1-first=E. |editor2-last=Borthwick |editor2-first=K. |editor3-last=Gallagher-Brett |editor3-first=A. |title=Employability for languages: a handbook |date=2016 |publisher=Researchpublishing.net |location=Dublin |isbn=978-1-908416-39-1 |pages=161–164 |chapter-url=https://dx.doi.org/10.14705/rpnet.2016.cbg2016.478 |chapter=Learning by teaching: developing transferable skills.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grzega |first1=Joachim |last2=Schöner |first2=Marion |title=The didactic model LdL (Lernen durch Lehren) as a way of preparing students for communication in a knowledge society |journal=Journal of Education for Teaching |date=4 July 2008 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=167–175 |doi=10.1080/02607470802212157}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The teacher remains actively involved, stepping in to further explain or provide support if the teaching-students falter or the learning-students do not seem to understand the material.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;

The method is distinct from [[tutoring]] in that LdL is done in class, supported by the teacher, and distinct from [[student teaching]], which is a part of [[teacher education]].&lt;ref name=Safiye/&gt;

== Plastic Platypus Learning ==
One way of learning by teaching, is the '''plastic platypus learning''' or '''platypus learning''' technique. This technique is based on evidence that show that teaching an inanimate object improves understanding and knowledge retention of a subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/04/learning-by-teaching-others-is-extremely-effective-a-new-study-tested-a-key-reason-why/ | title=Learning by teaching others is extremely effective – a new study tested a key reason why| date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aslan |first1=Safiye |title=Is Learning by Teaching Effective in Gaining 21st Century Skills? The Views of Pre-Service Science Teachers |journal=Educational Sciences: Theory &amp; Practice |date=2015 |volume=15 |issue=6 |doi=10.12738/estp.2016.1.0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bargh |first1=John A. |last2=Schul |first2=Yaacov |title=On the cognitive benefits of teaching. |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |date=1980 |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=593–604 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.72.5.593}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The advantage of this technique is that that the learner does not need the presence of another person in order to teach the subject.

The name 'plastic platypus learning' is a paraphrase on the known [[software engineering]] technique [[rubber duck debugging]], in which a programmer can find bugs in their code without the help of others, simply by explaining what the code does, line by line, to an inanimate object - namely, a rubber duck.

[[File:Plastic platypus learning cropped.jpg|thumb|Plastic platypus learning in action]]
To increase the effectiveness of plastic platypus learning, learners are advised to do the following:

1. Prepare notes while learning the subject.

2. Prepare the lesson on the subject (as opposed to just teaching it unprepared; this section demands the most time and energy, and may be omitted in some situations).

3. Teach the subject without using the notes at all (the student knows this beforehand).
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1002/acp.3410|title = The learning benefits of teaching: A retrieval practice hypothesis| journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology| volume=32| issue=3| pages=401–410|year = 2018|last1 = Koh|first1 = Aloysius Wei Lun| last2=Lee| first2=Sze Chi| last3=Lim| first3=Stephen Wee Hun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obviously, this technique may work with any inanimate object, and not just plastic platypuses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2406">'''Marcelo Araúz Lavadenz''' is a [[Bolivia]]n festival director, culture promoter, choir leader and music educator.

He was born on October 20, 1934 in [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]] and spend his youth on the [[lowland]]s of [[Palmar de las Islas]]. He studied [[Sociology]] at the [[KU Leuven|Katholic University of Leuven]] in [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name="CirulArt"&gt;CirulArt, [http://www.circulart.org/index.php?modo=promotores&amp;id=79 biography]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Araúz worked initially for the [[France|French]] [[Alliance française]] and the Casa de la Cultura Raúl Otero Reiche in [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]]. Then he became secretary-general for the Asociación Pro Arte y Cultura (Apac), a Bolivian organization for the promotion of art and culture. Furthermore, he is the founder of Urubichá Choir that is dedicated to [[baroque music]]. The baroque in the region of Santa Cruz developed under the influence of old culture exchanges with the local [[Amerindians|Indian people]].&lt;ref name="CirulArt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apac, [http://www.festivalesapac.com/directorio.htm directorio] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VdDdlCdB"&gt;Viceministerio de Desarrollo de las Culturas de Bolivia (2003) [http://www.bolivia.com/empresas/cultura/Boletin_Informativo/boletin184.asp ''Gestion con la entrega de premios''] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is director of two biannual international festivals in Bolovia in the field of [[music]] and [[theater]]: the ''Festival Internacional de Música Barroca y Renacentista "Misiones de Chiquitos"'' and the ''Festival Internacional de Santa Cruz de la Sierra''.&lt;ref name="CirulArt" /&gt;

Araúz was rewarded with prizes several times. One of them was the [[Prince Claus Awards|Prince Claus Award]] from the [[Netherlands]] in 2002. Furthermore he received the highest award of Bolivia in 2003, in the [[Order of the Condor of the Andes]].&lt;ref name="CirulArt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VdDdlCdB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://princeclausfund.org/en/network/user/id/287 profile]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Margaret Ponce Israel''' (a/k/a Marge Israel) (1929–1987) was a painter and ceramist who lived and worked in New York City. She was married to New York artist [[Marvin Israel]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Ponce was born in 1929 in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], brought to the US as an infant.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McGill|first1=Douglas|title=Margaret Israel, 57, an artist|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/24/obituaries/margaret-israel-57-an-artist.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 1987 at age 57 in Manhattan, hit by a tractor-trailer while riding her bike on West 23rd Street.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; 

Israel attended the [[High School of Music &amp; Art]] in New York and [[Syracuse University]], studying ceramics at [[Greenwich House Pottery]], where she eventually became an instructor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Makers: A History of American Studio Craft|last=Koplos|first=Janet and Bruce Metcalf|publisher=University of North Carolina Press, Center for Craft, Creativity, and Design|year=2010|isbn=978-0-8078-3413-8|location=Hendersonville, NC|pages=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1956 Israel won both first and second prize in ceramics at the ''Young Americans'' exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts, today the [[Museum of Arts and Design]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Upon her death, her studio was overflowing with artwork. Her studio/home was a three-story building in Manhattan that was once a horse stable. There she housed a bantam rooster, guinea hens, doves, a rabbit, dogs, and a cat. Her works depict many of these animals, and an exhibit of her work, "A Domestic Bestiary," was at the Perimeter Gallery in [[Chicago]] in February, 1998.  She taught at [[Parsons School of Design]]; [[Greenwich House Pottery]]; High School of Music &amp; Art; [[Y.M.H.A.]]; all in NYC, and at [[Ecole des Beaux Arts]]; [[Stanley William Hayter]] Graphic Art Studio; [[Atelier 17]]; and, [[Academie de la Grande Chaumiere]] all in [[Paris]], [[France]].

'''Yuriy Mikhailovich Chervochkin''' ({{lang-ru|Юрий Михайлович Червочкин}}; 31 December 1984 – 10 December 2007) was a [[Russia]]n [[The Other Russia (coalition)|opposition]] activist. He was murdered at the age of 22. His case shook [[Russia]]n opposition because he was attacked two days before [[Dissenters' March]] and some observers remained convinced that perpetrators of the crime were members of [[Russia]]n [[Militsiya]].

==Oppositional activities==
In 2006, Chervochkin founded a branch of the [[National Bolshevik Party]] in [[Serpukhov]]. On 2 October 2006 Chervochkin had been part of a group of 50 [[National Bolshevik Party|national-bolsheviks]] detained while trying to pass the [[State Duma]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kasparov.ru/material.php?id=4520CB3D827E0|title=Попытка № 2|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 March 2007 Chervochkin had participated in [[direct action]] in a polling station in [[Odintsovo]] to protest against election rigging. Chervochkin was arrested during the action and was placed under arrest for a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.svoboda.org/a/382562.html|title=Арестованы три лимоновца|website=Радио Свобода|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum-msk.org/material/news/307175.html|title=Нацболы атаковали избирательные участки в нескольких регионах России - Новости -  ФОРУМ.мск|website=forum-msk.org|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 June 2007 he was beaten by the [[militsiya]] and arrested for 5 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbp-info.ru/6037.html Провокация против лидера отделения «Другой России» в Серпухове] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011103237/http://nbp-info.ru/6037.html |date=2011-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbp-info.com/6041.html Серпухов: суд взял время на раздумье] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027201704/http://www.nbp-info.com/6041.html |date=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chevochkin was repeatedly detained during the [[Dissenters' March]]es.

==Murder==
22 November 2007 Chervochkin called a journalist hours before his attack and claimed he was being chased by the [[militsiya]] (UBOP), who had repeatedly detained and interrogated him earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sobkorr.ru/news/475D7AFCAB2C6.html|title=ИА Собкор®ru - Новости - Умер  жестоко избитый активист "Другой России" Юра Червочкин|website=www.sobkorr.ru|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sobkorr.ru/news/48442BC35BAA7.html|title=ИА Собкор®ru - Новости - Следственное управление решило возобновить дело о смерти Червочкина, но мать нацбола такого постановления не получала|website=www.sobkorr.ru|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Сочнев"&gt;Алексей Сочнев.[http://www.kasparov.ru/material.php?id=47E0ECF312151 Нет рычагов]&lt;/ref&gt; According to some sources, he reported the same of his bride to be (the leader of National Bolsheviks of Tula Anna Ploskonosova), accusing an officer of militsiya, Alexey Okopny, of being behind it.&lt;ref name="Cуд"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grani.ru/Society/Law/m.207517.html|title=Грани.Ру: Окопный подал в суд на Аксенова и Шехтмана|website=grani.ru|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the evening he was beaten on the head with a baseball bat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kasparov.ru/material.php?id=47472E1EE1B23|title=Зверское избиение|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis explained an open brain injury and a fracture of the skull base. Chervochkin fell into [[coma]]. On 11 December 2007 Yuri Chervochkin died in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grani.ru/Events/m.131115.phtml Избитый в Подмосковье нацбол скончался] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215642/http://grani.ru/Events/m.131115.phtml |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation===
The perpetrators of the crime have never been found. Two investigations, carried out by the local prosecutor’s office, stalled and finally ended, due to lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grani.ru/Politics/Russia/activism/m.162469.html|title=Грани.Ру: Мать Червочкина приковалась наручниками к зданию СКП|website=grani.ru|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grani.ru/Politics/Russia/m.137284.html|title=Грани.Ру: Дело об убийстве Юрия Червочкина закрыто|website=grani.ru|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/society/40086.html|title=Следствие по неосторожности кончилось|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kasparov.ru/material.php?id=4761326EBE0DC|title=УБОП в окопах|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://grani.ru/Politics/Russia/activism/m.162469.phtml Мать Червочкина приковалась наручниками к зданию СКП] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213509/http://grani.ru/Politics/Russia/activism/m.162469.phtml |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition and Chervochkin's family version===
Chervochkin's family, friends and political comrades remained convinced that Chervochkin was the victim of [[Russia]]n [[Militsiya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.svoboda.org/a/425642.html|title=В НБП обвиняют УБОП в смерти своего товарища|website=Радио Свобода|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbp-info.ru/7184.html Убийц Юры Червочкина к ответу!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818094345/http://www.nbp-info.ru/7184.html |date=2012-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbp-info.ru/7098.html Умер избитый УБОПовцами Юрий Червочкин] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820063819/http://www.nbp-info.ru/7098.html |date=2012-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echo.msk.ru/programs/razvorot_morning/57044/ Разворот утренний: Смерть Юрия Червочкина]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of observers believed that the attack may have been motivated by his political activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grani.ru/Events/m.131908.html|title=Грани.Ру: "Ведомости" назвали нацбола Червочкина одной из "персон года"|website=grani.ru|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://namarsh-ru.livejournal.com/1078185.html|title=За что чуть не убили Юрия Червочкина|first1=|last1=anka71|first2=|last2=namarsh_ru|date=27 November 2007|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct responsible for murder they call Department of fight against extremism of Office of fight against organized crime (UBOP) of the Moscow region and personally the chief of this department Alexey Okopny.

On 18 October 2012 Okopny brought an action against one of party leaders «[[The Other Russia (party)|Other Russia]]» (the former National Bolshevik Party) [[Sergei Aksenov]] and civil activist Pavel Shechtman, demanding a denial of statements about his participation in murder.&lt;ref name="Cуд"/&gt; December 6, 2012 the court sentenced Aksenov and Schechtman to a fine (in 40 and 50 thousand roubles), but did not require them to publish a refutation of charges&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grani.ru/tags/police/m.209415.html|title=Грани.Ру: Суд частично удовлетворил иск Окопного к Аксенову и Шехтману|website=grani.ru|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lenta.ru/news/2012/12/06/okopny/|title=Сотрудник Центра "Э" засудил оппозиционеров|publisher=|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, Pavel Shechtman published the article "The Story of a Murder", in which Okopny newly is accused of involvement in the murder, based this time on the materials of the judicial process.&lt;ref name="История"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grani.ru/blogs/free/entries/209518.html|title=Грани.Ру - Павел Шехтман: История одного убийства|website=grani.ru|accessdate=2 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9600">The '''National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE)''' (pronounced: nessie) is a survey mechanism used to measure the level of student participation at [[University|universities]] and [[college]]s in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] as it relates to learning and engagement.'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nsse.indiana.edu/html/origins.cfm|title = Our Origins and Potential|date = |accessdate = |website = National Survey of Student Engagement|publisher = Center for Postsecondary Research - Indiana University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;''' The results of the survey help [[Academic administration|administrators]] and [[professor]]s to assess their students' [[student engagement]]. The survey targets first-year and senior students on campuses.  NSSE developed ten student Engagement Indicators (EIs) that are categorized in four general themes: academic challenge, learning with peers, experiences with faculty, and campus environment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nsse.indiana.edu/html/engagement_indicators.cfm|title = Engagement Indicators|date = |accessdate = |website = National Survey of Student Engagement|publisher = Indiana University Center for Postsecondary Research|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2000, there have been over 1,600 colleges and universities that have opted to participate in the survey.  Additionally, approximately 5 million students within those institutions have completed the engagement survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nsse.indiana.edu/html/about.cfm|title = About NSSE|date = |accessdate = |website = National Survey of Student Engagement|publisher = Center for Postsecondary Research|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, NSSE assesses ''effective teaching'' practices ''and'' student engagement in educationally purposeful activities. The survey is administered and assessed by [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] [[School of education|School of Education]] Center for [[Postsecondary education|Postsecondary]] Research.

== History ==
The initial idea of the National Survey of Student Engagement centers on providing an alternative metric of evaluation for colleges and universities to measure “quality” on a national platform and it is designed specifically to gauge the extent of student engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nsse.indiana.edu/html/origins.cfm|title = Origins and Potential|date = |accessdate = |website = National Survey of Student Engagement|publisher = Center for Postsecondary Research - Indiana University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuh, G. D. (2001). The
National Survey of Student Engagement: Conceptual framework and overview of
psychometric properties. ''Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Center for
Postsecondary Research'', 1-26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The NSSE was birthed in 1998 and financially supported by a grant from the [[The Pew Charitable Trusts|Pew Charitable Trusts]]. Much of the quality metrics according to the initial working group of higher education leaders that the Pew Charitable Trust organized concluded that there were few external incentives for institutions to partake in “''meaningful quality improvement''.” The quality concept as it relates to colleges and universities has largely been impacted by [[accrediting agencies]], government [[regulation]]s (e.g. licensure standards), and ''third-party'' rankings (''e.g.'' ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'') that focus on student selectivity and faculty [[credential]]s.  Nevertheless, these types of quality metrics do not give insight regarding the resources institutions invest to facilitate significant academic experiences/activities or effective instructional practices that demonstrate high-level of engagement and success in college&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Objectives ===
The National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) contestably, serves as a tool for four-year institutions to gather data centered on institutional quality, ultimately to be used to improve undergraduate studies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;National Survey
of Student Engagement. (2014). ''Bringing the Institution into Focus—Annual
Results 2014.''Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Center for Postsecondary
Research.&lt;/ref&gt; This quality is measured by the energy that students spend engaging in meaningful educational experiences ( high-impact
practices) during college that have significantly impacted desired learning outcomes and overall student experiences, regardless of institutional type and the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = What matters in college? Four critical years revisited|last = Astin|first = Alexander W.|publisher = Jossey-Bass|year = 1993|isbn = |location = San Francisco|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pascarella, E. T.,

Measuring the quality of student effort. ''Current Issues in Higher Education'',
''2''(1), 10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Purposeful institutional priorities and practices lead to student engagement and student success in college. Institutions that align their resources to foster engagement potentially experience higher levels of quality– the marriage of purposeful engagement and institutional quality.&lt;ref&gt;Kuh, G.D.
(2001). Assessing what really matters to student learning: Inside the National
Survey of Student Engagement. Change, 33(3), 10-17, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several identifiers that [[researchers]] have studied that draw parallels to student success among institutions; the survey provides colleges and universities with the student engagement data that show strengths and opportunities for growth.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Kuh, George D.
(2008). “High-impact educational practices: What they are, who has access to
them, and why they matter.” AAC&amp;U, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Student Engagement Defined ==
Students’ responses in the survey have been categorized into ten Engagement Indicators (EIs) and narrowly concentrated among four general themes: academic challenge, learning with
peers, experiences with faculty, and campus environment.  NSSEs ten Engagement Indicators include:higher-order learning, reflective and integrative learning, learning strategies, quantitative reasoning, learning with peers, discussions with diverse others, experiences with faculty, effective teaching practices, quality of interactions, and supportive environments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Moreover, NSSE provides results on six High-Impact practices (HIPs) that are duly noted for their positive outcomes on ''student learning'' and ''retention.''&lt;ref&gt;National Survey
of Student Engagement. (2015). Engagement Indicators. Retrieved from National
Survey of Student Engagement :
&lt;nowiki&gt;http://nsse.indiana.edu/html/engagement_indicators.cfm&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  These HIPs are known by researchers as educational experiences that shift one’s trajectory of success in college.  The HIPs refer to: learning community, service-learning, research with faculty (effective for first-year student and seniors), internship or field experience, study abroad, and culminating senior experience that seniors should engage in (e.g. capstone project).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nsse.indiana.edu/html/high_impact_practices.cfm|title = High-Impact Practices|date = |accessdate = |website = National Survey of Student Engagement|publisher = Indiana University Center for Postsecondary Research|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, George Kuh suggested that all students should experience at least one HIP during their first-year and one during senior year.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These teaching and learning practices have been proven to be beneficial to
college students from various backgrounds.

== NSSE Survey- Outcomes ==
The survey offers an unconventional assessment for evaluating collegiate quality by collecting data that is used to depict institutional experiences and instructional practices that affects learning and college student success.  There are three envisioning principles for data collected by NSSE.  The first is to allow a vehicle for institutions to improve upon its undergraduate studies program (e.g. how the institution aligns with its strategic foci). Secondly, external agencies such as accrediting bodies and state agencies of higher education could use the information to gauge institutional effectiveness.  Lastly, the publication of results could be of interest to media outlets as a means of incorporating into college ranking metrics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Selected results ===
* ''While aggregate results generally reveal that underrepresented and'' underprepared students rate the quality of their interactions with others on campus lower relative to their peers, these groups evidenced no relative disadvantage at an appreciable subset of institutions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* ''Average levels of students’ experiences with faculty—effective'' teaching practices and student-faculty interaction—varied notably from one institution to the next, even when examined within selectivity strata.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* ''One in three first-year students rarely met with an advisor. The'' proportion who rarely sought advice was higher among commuting, nontraditional-aged, and part-time students—suggesting the need for special outreach efforts for such students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Oberstudienrat''' ('''OStR''') (senior councillor of studies) is an official title for a certain rank of teacher in [[Germany]], mostly employed in state-run grammar schools. An ''Oberstudienrat'' is a civil servant who belongs to the ''höherer Dienst'' (higher service), a category which is senior to the ''gehobener'' (elevated), the ''mittlerer'' (middle) and the ''einfacher'' (ordinary) ''Dienstgrad'' (service rank) in the civil service. An ''Oberstudienrat'' is remunerated according to category "A 14", which means a salary of at least some 50&amp;nbsp;000&amp;nbsp; € per year, exactly as much as the lower-half Lieutenant Colonels, and after at least two but no more than eight years of service is roughly as much as the lowest rank of judges and state prosecutors. The equivalent title of an official in civil administration is ''Oberregierungsrat'' (senior councillor in government administration).&lt;ref&gt;German civil service ranks, 2017 http://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/beamte/ni/besoldungsgruppen.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;German civil service salary categories 2015 http://www.beamtenbesoldung.org/beamtenbesoldung.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Oberstudienrat'' is the position immediately senior to ''Studienrat'' (councillor in education). Until the 1980s this promotion was reached regularly after a specified time of service. Today, promotion mostly presupposes additional functions and duties.&lt;ref&gt;The Unfree Professions: German Lawyers, Teachers, and Engineers, 1900-1950

About 20 percent of civil servants at educational institutions in Germany are ''Oberstudienräte'' (2014).

The following higher ranks are ''Studiendirektor'' (director of studies) and ''Oberstudiendirektor'' (senior director of studies).

In the former [[German Democratic Republic]], ''Oberstudienrat'' was not used as denominating a rank but solely as an honorary title of high reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Sprache in der DDR: ein Wörterbuch von Birgit Wolf, Walter de Gruyter, 2000 https://books.google.de/books?id=bCw-jyr7tnEC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=oberstudienrat&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=oberstudienrat&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''One Woman Can''' campaign was launched in 2007 by [[Americans for UNFPA]] to raise awareness among Americans that the U.S. is the only country that has ever withheld money from UNFPA, the [[United Nations Population Fund]], for political reasons and to draw attention to the urgent need for Congress and the President to prioritize women’s health and rights.  Since 2002, the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] has withheld $161 million from women everywhere. As a direct result, the Administration’s actions severely compromise the health and dignity of women everywhere.

UNFPA provides women’s health care and promotes the rights of women worldwide. It is the largest international source of such assistance.  As the official committee for UNFPA in the United States, Americans for UNFPA generates awareness of UNFPA’s work, fundraises for field programs and advocates for U.S. policies in support of UNFPA.

The [http://www.americansforunfpa.org/getinvolved One Woman Can] campaign calls on Americans, especially women, to take action to ensure the health and dignity of women everywhere. The campaign features many actions, including writing to Congressmen urging them to support the Women’s Health and Dignity Act and signing the Release the Funds petition to President Bush.

== Methods ==

===Legislation===

The campaign launched on June 5, 2007 by urging Americans to ask their members of Congress to sign-on to the International Women’s Health and Dignity Act.

Championed by U.S. Congressman [[Joseph Crowley]] (D-NY), the International Women’s Health and Dignity Act will restore U.S. moral and political support for UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund’s efforts to combat some of the most intractable problems endured by women. The Act will show that U.S. leadership believes in the work of UNFPA.

“Voters and constituents play a vital role in improving the health and dignity of women,” says [[Anika Rahman]], President, Americans for UNFPA. “Wherever a woman lives, whatever her economic status, whether she is a giver or a receiver of help, she can take some action, large or small, on behalf of UNFPA and women everywhere.”

===Petition===

Though the U.S. was instrumental in forming UNFPA, it has withheld funding to UNFPA since 2002. Each year Congress allocates roughly $40 million from the federal budget to fund UNFPA, but because of a loophole in the law, President Bush is able to block the funding from UNFPA. In the last 5 years, a total of $161 million was withheld from UNFPA, funding that could have prevented hundreds of thousands of maternal deaths and allowed millions of women to delay their first or next pregnancy. So far, the petition has collected over 2,400 signatures.

===Online engagement===

The One Woman Can Campaign utilizes the Internet as a major tool in helping Americans take action for its cause. The campaign created Facebook, MySpace, Digg, Flickr and Del.icio.us accounts, as well as established a relationship with RH Reality Check, an online community and publication serving individuals and organizations committed to advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights. Anika Rahman, the President of Americans for UNFPA, contributes a weekly blog post to the site.

The [[Republic of Panama]] is one of the oldest and best-known tax havens in [[the Caribbean]], as well as one of the most established in the region.&lt;ref name=Maverick&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maverick|first1=J. B.|title=Why Is Panama Considered a Tax Haven?|url=http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/093015/why-panama-considered-tax-haven.asp|accessdate=May 5, 2016|work=Investopedia|date=September 30, 2015|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panama has had a reputation for [[tax avoidance]] since the early [[20th century]], and Panama has been cited repeatedly in recent years as a jurisdiction which does not cooperate with international tax transparency initiatives.

Panama's offshore sector is intimately tied to the [[Panama canal]], which has made it a gateway and ''entrepôt'' for international trade.&lt;ref name="PanamaTJN" /&gt; There are strong similarities between Panama and other leading tax havens like Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai. On paper at least, Panama has the largest shipping fleet in the world, greater than those of the US and China combined, according to the [[Tax Justice Network]].

==Background (1910s–1970s)==
[[File:Panama Canal under construction, 1907.jpg|thumb|Construction work on the [[Gaillard Cut]] of the [[Panama Canal]], 1907]]
A 2014 investigation by journalist [[Ken Silverstein]] published in ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice Magazine]]'' explains how Panama came into being, with US help:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1903, the administration of Theodore Roosevelt created the country after bullying Colombia to hand over what was then the province of Panama. Roosevelt acted at the behest of various banking groups, among them [[J. P. Morgan &amp; Co.]], which was appointed as the country's official "fiscal agent".&lt;ref name=Silverstein /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An operation{{which|date=July 2016}} approved by the [[Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt|Roosevelt administration]] sought to foment armed rebellion, forcing Panama away from Colombia, then politically fragile. Roosevelt achieved this goal with the help of [[William Nelson Cromwell]], a well-connected US Republican lawyer and also legal counsel for JP Morgan's railroad interests. The administration's key objective was allegedly to install a pro-US Panamanian government that would secure US rights over the [[Panama Canal]].&lt;ref name="Diaz-Espino2014"&gt;

|page=120
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty]] resulted, establishing permanent U.S. rights to a [[Panama Canal Zone]] several miles wide, across the neck of the isthmus. Panama became independent from Colombia the same month, and the Panama Canal opened in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2013 academic study published by the Norwegian Center for Taxation, Panama's reputation as a [[tax haven]] began in the year 1919, when it began registering foreign ships in order to help [[Standard Oil]] avoid US taxes and regulations; other US ship owners followed, some seeking to avoid the higher wages and better working conditions imposed by US legislation such as the Seaman's Act and safety standards for sea vessels.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Also, during the [[Prohibition era]], US passenger ships were allowed to serve alcohol to their customers without breaking the law if they had Panamanian registration.&lt;ref name="Armando Jose Garcia Pires"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few years, Panama extended its minimalist approach to taxation, regulation and financial disclosure requirements to the world of [[offshore finance]]. According to the study, "Wall Street interests helped Panama introduce lax company incorporation laws, which let anyone start tax-free, anonymous corporations, with few questions asked".&lt;ref name="Armando Jose Garcia Pires" /&gt;

==Background (1970s–present)==
For decades, offshore finance had a relatively modest profile in Panama, but it took off in the 1970s as world oil prices surged. During this time, the Republic of Panama passed legislation "entrenching corporate and individual financial secrecy".&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;
{{cite news
|title=Panama Papers: How did Panama become a tax haven?
|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-35967590
|work=BBC News
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1982, partly attracted by business opportunities deriving from the Panama Canal and its free trade zone, more than 100 international banks had offices in Panama City.&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt;

According to ''[[Investopedia]]'': "Panama's offshore jurisdiction offers a wide array of excellent financial services, including offshore banking, the incorporation of offshore companies, registration of ships and the formation of Panama trusts and foundations."&lt;ref name=Maverick /&gt; In Panama, no taxes are imposed on offshore companies which engage in business solely outside of the jurisdiction; therefore, the companies which are incorporated in the Republic of Panama and the owners of these companies are exempt from [[corporate taxes]], [[withholding tax]]es, [[capital gains tax]], [[local taxes]], [[estate taxes]] and [[inheritance tax]]. However, businesses within Panama itself are permitted to conduct business there so long as the company pays its local taxes.&lt;ref name=Maverick /&gt;

Panama has been cited repeatedly in recent years by the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] of the [[United States]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) as a jurisdiction which does not cooperate with international tax transparency initiatives due to the legislation which regulates the country's offshore jurisdiction and financial services.&lt;ref&gt;Panama as a jurisdiction which does not cooperate with international tax transparency initiatives:

Alongside incorporation of IBCs, Panama is active in forming tax-evading foundations and trusts, insurance, and boat and shipping registration, according to the [[Tax Justice Network]].&lt;ref name="PanamaTJN" /&gt;

===Financial privacy===
[[File:Countries implicated in the Panama Papers.svg|thumb |325px |right |Countries with politicians, public officials or close associates implicated in the [[Panama Papers]] leak on April 15, 2016]]

An extensive amount of legislation currently exists in the Republic of Panama to protect corporate and financial privacy. However, organisations such as the [[Tax Justice Network]] and other [[advocacy groups]] and [[non-governmental organisations]] state that the main intention of these laws is financial secrecy, as opposed to privacy.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of [[shareholders]] of Panamanian corporations, trusts and foundations are still not required by law to be publicly registered. Panama has no [[exchange controls]]: this means that for individual clients of Panama's offshore banking, as well as for offshore business entities incorporated in Panama, there are no limits or reporting requirements on money transfers into or out of the country.&lt;ref name=Maverick /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt;

Panama also has very strict banking secrecy laws: for example, it is forbidden for Panamanian banks to share any information about offshore bank accounts or account holders, except under special circumstances instigated by the Panamanian authorities. Such regulation has made it difficult to investigate the true extent of the [[Panama Papers]] leak, as severe criminal penalties are enacted to individuals who breach confidentiality.&lt;ref name=Maverick /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt;

Despite this, Panama does not appear on the [[Tax Justice Network]]'s top ten list for financial secrecy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=View 2015 Results|url=http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/introduction/fsi-2015-results|website=Financial Secrecy Index|publisher=Tax Justice Network|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208055612/http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/introduction/fsi-2015-results|archivedate=2015-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Alex Cobham of Tax Justice Network saying "There is a double standard: many developed countries host or support jurisdictions where there is an absence of financial transparency".&lt;ref name="BBC top 10"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Seitz|first1=Max|title=Why the top 10 tax havens don't include Panama|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35998801|work=BBC Mundo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Manuel Noriega]], commander of the [[Panamanian Public Forces#The Panamanian Defense Forces|Panama Defence Forces]], took power in Panama in 1983, Silverstein said, Noriega essentially nationalised the money-laundering business; he partnered with the [[Medellín Cartel|Medellin drug cartel]] and gave it free rein to operate in the country."&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Silverstein&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], ''[[Private Eye]]'' used data collected from the [[Land Registry]] to create "an easily searchable online map ... of properties in England and Wales owned by offshore companies.

Most of these properties are tax avoidance vehicles and in some cases also to conceal wealth of dubious origin."&lt;ref&gt;

A 2003 examination of tax havens by [[Jeffrey Robinson]] quotes a US Customs official as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Panama] is filled with dishonest lawyers, dishonest bankers, dishonest company formation agents and dishonest companies registered there by those dishonest lawyers so that they can deposit dirty money into their dishonest banks. The [[Colon Free Trade Zone|Free Trade Zone]] is the black hole through which Panama has become one of the filthiest money laundering sinks in the world.&lt;ref name="ConversationPanama"&gt;

The [[advocacy group]] the [[Tax Justice Network]] has described [[Panama]] as "the recipient of drugs money from Latin America, plus ample other sources of dirty money from the US and elsewhere".&lt;ref name="ConversationPanama" /&gt; It said "now is a good moment to draw attention to how Panama developed as a secrecy jurisdiction and how it continues to provide full service – wash, rinse and dry – to crooks and money launderers from around the world."&lt;ref name="ConversationPanama" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

'''Patricia Craig''' (''née'' Duncklee; born July 21, 1947) is an [[United States|American]] operatic [[soprano]] and voice teacher.

==Operatic career==
Born Patricia Duncklee in [[Long Island, New York]], she studied music education at [[Ithaca College]], graduating in 1965. Craig gained her first critical vocal acclaim as a winner of the [[Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions]]. Her performing career spans more than three decades of major roles in the leading opera houses of the world. She made her [[Metropolitan Opera]] debut in 1978 as Marenka in ''[[The Bartered Bride]]'', under [[James Levine]], in [[John Dexter]]'s production. Met audiences heard her for the next twelve seasons in a variety of leading roles in operas, including ''[[Madama Butterfly]],'' ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites]],'' ''[[La Bohème]],'' and ''[[Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny]].'' Craig is a specialist in Puccini and Verdi heroines whose other operatic credits include performances with [[New York City Opera]]; [[Teatro la Fenice]] in Venice, Italy; the [[Festival of Two Worlds]] in both Spoleto, Italy, and Charleston, South Carolina; L’Opéra de Marseilles; and the companies of Cincinnati, Miami, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C.  Concert performances include Tchaikovsky's ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|The Queen of Spades]]'' with the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] under [[Seiji Ozawa]].

==Teaching career==
Craig joined the [[New England Conservatory]] faculty in 1990, where she taught until retiring from there in 2010, when she became a member of the voice faculty of the [[San Francisco Conservatory of Music]]. Several of her students have gained recognition in national competitions; others are singing with major opera companies in the United States and abroad. Craig has studied and collaborated with prominent artists including Donald Craig, Marenka Gurevitch, [[Magda Olivero]], James de Blasis, [[Henry Lewis (musician)|Henry Lewis]], [[Jeffrey Tate]], Diane Richardson, Joan Dornemann, [[Martin Katz]], Warren Jones, [[Anton Coppola]], and [[Julius Rudel]].

In addition to her private voice studio in San Francisco and teaching masterclasses she has taught at AIMS in [[Graz|Graz, Austria]], and the Bay Area Summer Opera Theater Institute (BASOTI), where she collaborated for many years with her late husband, the Wagnerian tenor and voice teacher [[Richard Cassilly]]. Craig serves as Founding Chairman of the Board of Overseers for [[Opera Boston]], and advisor to [[Boston Lyric Opera]], and the Bel Canto Institute. She has been a competition adjudicator for organizations including the [[Metropolitan Opera]], the [[Baltimore Opera]], and the Cincinnati [[College-Conservatory of Music]].

{{italic title}}
'''''Privatdozent''''' (for men) or '''''Privatdozentin''''' (for women), abbreviated '''PD''', '''P.D.''' or '''Priv.-Doz.''', is an academic title similar to [[Adjunct professor]] in [[North America]] conferred at some European universities, especially in [[German language|German]]-speaking countries, to someone who holds certain formal qualifications that denote an ability to teach (''[[venia legendi]]'') a designated subject at university level. In its current usage, the title indicates that the holder has permission to teach and examine independently without  having a chair. The title is not necessarily connected to a salaried position, but may entail a nominal obligation to teach.

==Conferment and roles==
A [[Faculty (division)|university faculty]] can confer the title to an academic who has a [[Doctorate#Higher doctorate and post-doctoral degrees|higher doctoral degree]] - usually in the form of a [[habilitation]].&lt;ref name="FAZ-201202"/&gt; The title, ''Privatdozent'', as such does not imply a salaried appointment; it merely denotes permission to teach and examine independently at the conferring faculty without a professorial appointment. At German universities, some title holders are appointed as ''[[Dozent]]'' on a [[Honorarium|fee  basis]], or as senior researchers through externally funded research projects.

Many title holders do not have remuneration agreements with their conferring institution, but depending on local regulations may be required to teach in order to maintain their status as a ''Privatdozent''.&lt;ref name="Zeit-201003"&gt;{{cite news|last1= Pape|first1= Helmut|title= ''Uni-Sklaven, vereinigt euch! ''|trans-title= University Slaves Unite!|url= http://www.zeit.de/2010/13/C-Unisklaven|accessdate= 6 June 2016|work= Die Zeit|date= 25 March 2010}} (in German).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 more than 5000  honorarium ''Privatdozenten'' worked  at German universities without a salary.&lt;ref name="FAZ-201202"&gt;
{{cite news

(in German).
&lt;/ref&gt;
A ''Privatdozent'' ceases to hold the title if appointed at professorial level or if discontinuing lecturing at the faculty. &lt;ref name="FAZ-201202"/&gt;

==History and future==
The title has its origins in German-speaking countries in Europe before 1800. It referred to a lecturer who received fees from his students rather than a university salary.

In [[Prussia]] it started around 1810, and became established  around 1860. From 1900 until 1968, most university professors who were appointed were title holders, as they obtained a habilitation and already held a teaching position.{{fact|date=June 2016}}

In Germany, since the end of the 1960s the requirement of a post-doctoral degree for a professorship has been questioned and in some cases became not always necessary. Since 2002, junior professorships provide a route to a professorship without habilitation. This has led to a decline in universities conferring the title ''Privatdozent'' in certain academic disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2002/08/junior-professors-rise|title=Junior Professors on the Rise|date=2002-08-02|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1883">The '''Queen Mother Pedagogical Institute''' ({{lang-sq|Instituti Femëror Nëna Mbretëreshë}}), was a women's pedagogical high school, created in 1933 in [[Tirana]], [[Albania]].&lt;ref name="Dishnica1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dhimitër Dishnica|title=Motrat Qiriazi: monografi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Z9CAQAAIAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Shtëpia Botuese "Enciklopedike"|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute, approved by Government Decree  nr. 666, date 2 October 1933, opened its doors on 30 November 1933, with 388 students, of which 100 were resident in Tirana, and the other non residents.

''Rapid serial visual presentation'' is an experimental model frequently used to examine the temporal characteristics of attention. The RSVP paradigm requires participants to look at a continuous presentation of visual items which is around 10 items per second. They are all shown in the same place. The targets are placed inside this stream of continuous items. They are separate from the rest of the items known as distracters. The distracters can either be a color change or it can be letters that are among the numbers.

==Overview==
There is a delay of several hundred milliseconds. A person might be asked to identify numbers in a string of letters which are shown one by one. The first number which is an important target, would be caught by the person, however, the second number flashed seconds later might not be observed. RSVP asks the question, What would reading be like if there were no eye movements? A text is delivered at a spot on the screen, like a series of flash cards. The user can set how long each card is to be displayed. The readers are liberated from having to decide how much time to spend on each word because that is set in advance, and saccades, regressive eye movements, line sweeps, and page turning have been eliminated. A reader can fully concentrate on comprehending the text as it flashes through, however, with longer texts the reading experience is found to be monotonous and exhausting. There are a number of theories to explain how and why this works and studies have explored its limitations and parameters to learn more about visual perception. The brain deals with a quick stream of incoming information at all times. With the attentional blink, the brain has to distribute its attentional resources to comprehend, interpret, and store the information properly. The human brain is capable of processing complex tasks, but it has restrictions. The attentional blink is an illustration that has a significant insinuation for individuals who work in environments where they are usually swamped with information. An example of this is an airport baggage screener who might see a knife in one bag, but misses a second knife in another bag that is right behind the first bag.  The failure to recognize the second target is because of the attentional processes that are linked with the identification of the first target.

==History==

Potter (1976)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0278-7393.2.5.509| title = Short-term conceptual memory for pictures| journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning &amp; Memory| volume = 2| issue = 5| pages = 509–522| year = 1976| last1 = Potter | first1 = M. C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  explored the amount people who are able to comprehend and memorize information from fast series of stimuli. Potter had participants search for the RSVP series of pictures for a specific picture which was the target. This was depicted before the appearance of the RSVP series. Results showed that participants performed well on this task. Here, the RSVP rate was eight items per second; however, participants were still able to accurately find the target on 75% of the trials. Performance was not different in the pictures that were previously presented or described. Each picture was acknowledged within 125 milliseconds. However, Potter &amp; Levy (1969) found that performance did change when participants were assessed on a recognition task for the pictures presented in the RSVP sequence. The results showed that the participants’ performance accurately scored 10% in the task when the RSVP rate was eight items per second.

Sperling and colleagues  examined the RSVP paradigm to investigate the dynamics of shifts of spatial attention (e.g., Reeves &amp; Sperling, 1986; Sperling &amp; Weichselgartner, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.93.2.180| pmid = 3714927| title = Attention gating in short-term visual memory| journal = Psychological Review| volume = 93| issue = 2| pages = 180–206| year = 1986| last1 = Reeves | first1 = A. | last2 = Sperling | first2 = G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sperling|first=G|author2=Weichselgartner, E. |title=Episodic theory of the dynamics of spatial attention|journal=Psychological Review|year=1995|volume=102|pages=503–522|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.3.503}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spatial attention is defined as the ability to center on specific stimuli in a visual environment (Johnson &amp; Proctor, 2004). Sperling used an attention shift procedure in which two RSVP series were presented altogether. There was a central point where one was to the left and the other was to the right of the focus point. One series contained letters and the other series contained numbers. The object of the task was for participants to focus on the letter stream and to report items from the number series following a certain letter. Results showed that participants frequently reported numbers that were heard around 400 milliseconds after the cue. They concluded that the findings were parallel with the time participants were required to shift attention from the series that had the letters to the series that had the numbers.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  examined if the same conclusions would be made if the participants had to report items from one RSVP series. Participants had to acknowledge and point out a certain letter and report other items that came after that letter. Results showed participants were more likely to report the items after the letter roughly around 400 milliseconds after the letter was presented. No spatial shift of attention was required. Participants only reported accurately the item following right after the cue but not any other item.

Broadbent and Broadbent (1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3758/BF03210498| title = From detection to identification: Response to multiple targets in rapid serial visual presentation| journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics| volume = 42| issue = 2| pages = 105–13| year = 1987| last1 = Broadbent | first1 = D.

P. | pmid=3627930}}&lt;/ref&gt;  discovered the attentional blink when they used a rapid serial visual presentation task to look at the recognition of multiple target words. Results showed that following the presence of a target, attentional processing is restricted and people can’t report the items that came after the target, however the presence of the item that comes after the target usually misses attentional blindness. This concludes that when two targets are shown within 500 milliseconds of one another and they are separated by one or more distractors, the second target usually falls within an attentional blink and will not be seen.

[[Inattentional blindness]] as also been looked at as a variation of the rapid serial visual presentation. Rees, Russell, Frith, and Driver (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.286.5449.2504| pmid = 10617465| title = Inattentional Blindness Versus Inattentional Amnesia for Fixated but Ignored Words| journal = Science| volume = 286| issue = 5449| pages = 2504–7| year = 1999| last1 = Rees | first1 = G.| last2 = Russell| first2 = C| last3 = Frith| first3 = C.

Participants were asked to watch out for repeats in the letter string or in the pictures that were displayed. They found that the attended words in the task were related to semantic processing.

==Attentional blink==
{{Main|Attentional blink}}

==Modes==

There are two common modes that are used to describe rapid serial visual presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spence|first=Robert|title=Rapid Serial Visual Presentation: Design for Cognition|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781447150855|author2=Witkowski, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the modes is the static mode. Here, the pictures come into view and then disappear without moving. The other mode, the moving mode is where pictures come into view serially, move about the display and then disappear.

===Static mode===
The pictures in the rapid serial visual presentation have the same entry and exit locations.  Pictures are shown one by one at the same rate. Here, participants must attend to a target that is shown for about 100 milliseconds. This is an advantage of this static mode. A disadvantage of the static mode is that there is no chance after that time to validate what was seen.  The attentional blink which usually lasts between 300-400 milliseconds leads up to the other stimuli not being seen. The static mode can produce three different aspects when looking at an image: steady gaze, search to steady and visual search.

===Moving modes===
We are usually represented with presentations that rely a great deal on movement of pictures in a 2D plane. These are more difficult to register in comparison than pictures that move back and forth. The basic psychology of human visual perception explains that people are inclined to register imagery in a 3D world. This mode believes rapid serial visual presentation is important when approaching and processing objects. The moving mode can produce three different aspects when looking at an image: diagonal, stream and ring.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Advantages over conventional reading==
The unique method used by RSVP allows for the reading of unlimited text in a limited position. Researchers from [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]] have found that as many as 12 words per second are readable in controlled situations (720wpm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1145/571985.572014| chapter = Web ''Thumb''| title = Proceedings of the 15th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology  - UIST '02| pages = 205| year = 2002| last1 = Wobbrock | first1 = J. O. | last2 = Forlizzi | first2 = J. | last3 = Hudson | first3 = S. E. | last4 = Myers | first4 = B. A. | isbn = 1581134886}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further research has shown that for shorter pieces of text, RSVP formats increased reading speed by 33% with no significant differences in comprehension or task load.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/3-540-45756-9_18| chapter = Towards an Improved Readability on Mobile Devices: Evaluating Adaptive Rapid Serial Visual Presentation| title = Human Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices| volume = 2411| pages = 225| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science| year = 2002| last1 = Öquist | first1 = G. | last2 = Goldstein | first2 = M. | isbn = 978-3-540-44189-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done by the [[Wichita State University]] suggests that at 250 words per minute (WPM) comprehension was not significantly different from reading done using Palm Reader ([[EReader]]).  Display at 650 WPM reduced comprehension by about 20% versus display at 250 WPM, from a score of 74.6 to 52.1, resulting in an effective 82% increase in words comprehended per minute, assuming the scoring is linear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071222063502/http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/41/rsvp_palm.htm Wichita State]&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that reading rate is determined by size of text and spacing. RSVP allows users to obtain a maximum reading rate through the ability to adjust text size and eliminate space by displaying one item at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1167/7.2.20| pmid = 18217835| title = Crowding and eccentricity determine reading rate| journal = Journal of Vision| volume = 7| issue = 2| pages = 20.1–36| year = 2007| last1 = Pelli | first1 = D.

==Disadvantages and limitations==

Several limitations are presented in the rapid serial visual presentation. The RSVP can cause an unnecessary need for cognitive demand. The memory load for each individual differs and can be high, because using RSVP, more attention is needed. Also, RSVP allows us to miss vital information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | pmid = 3672124
| year = 1987
| author1 = Weichselgartner
| first1 = E
| title = Dynamics of automatic and controlled visual attention

| issue = 4828
| pages = 778–80
| last2 = Sperling
| first2 = G
 | doi=10.1126/science.3672124
}}&lt;/ref&gt; RSVP also often results with [[repetition blindness]] during use. When presented with a sequence of visual stimuli in rapid succession at the same location, readers often fail to detect words prominently repeated in a series, thus potentially missing the main ideas of the text.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Other disadvantages include [[attentional blink]], in which the mind focuses longer on certain words which may strike an emotional chord and puts the reader behind in a sequence, {{citation needed|date=February 2013}} as well as [[temporal masking]], causing certain words when being read aloud in a series may evoke a striking sound or response that makes inaudible the mental articulation of the following word.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Web browsing on small-screen devices===

Using RSVP-based browsers offers a space–time trade-offs for information presentation on small screen devices such as cell phones and PDAs. However to make this solution functional location and context related questions like 'Where am I', 'Where can I usefully go', 'Where have I been' and 'How do I get back to X', need to be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s007790200024| title = RSVP Browser: Web Browsing on Small Screen Devices| journal = Personal and Ubiquitous Computing| volume = 6| issue = 4| pages = 245–252| year = 2002| last1 = De Bruijn | first1 = O.| last2 = Spence | first2 = R.| last3 = Chong | first3 = M. Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
RSVP can aid those with poor eyesight with its one text at a time display that enlarges and highlights the words.

===Peripheral reading===
Peripheral reading is vital to those suffering from [[Central scotoma|central field loss]], which is most commonly seen in the elderly.  Factors which might limit one's peripheral reading rate include acuity, crowding, and eye movements.  Many find difficulty making the correct eye movements for peripheral reading, but the dependence on eye movements can be minimized through the presentation format of RSVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1167/7.2.20| pmid = 18217835| title = Crowding and eccentricity determine reading rate| journal = Journal of Vision| volume = 7| issue = 2| pages = 20.1–36| year = 2007| last1 = Pelli | first1 = D.

===Adolescent sexual offenders===
Limited existing previous research by Beech et al. suggests that images presented in RSVP have the potential to elicit a response from adolescent sexual offenders by measuring the effects of attentional blink.  A stronger attentional blink is expected among adolescent sexual offenders after viewing a series of child related images.  However, this hypothesis has not held up to subsequent research and remains an area of continued debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/1079063208328677| title = Applying Rapid Serial Visual Presentation to Adolescent Sexual Offenders: Attentional Bias as a Measure of Deviant Sexual Interest?| journal = Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment| volume = 21| issue = 2| pages = 135–148| year = 2009| last1 = Crooks | first1 = V.

The school's methods prompted criticism in the media and disputes with the [[London County Council]]. The school closed in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.risinghill.co.uk/md.htm Risinghall Revisited - Michael Duane (1915 – 1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Risinghill: Death of a Comprehensive School, Leila Berg, Penguin Books {{ISBN|978-0-14-020883-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The school buildings in Risinghill Street, London N1, were subsequently utilised by Starcross School which was later renamed [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School]].

Pupils received religious education through Saint Silas Church, which was part of Risinghill. Lessons included technical and craft skills, taught through dual or multi-purpose creative methods.

HRD Press Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, the International Society for Performance Improvement created an honorary award named the Roger Kaufman Award for Societal Impact honoring the work of individuals or groups who apply this systemic performance assessment and planning process with clear impact on societal outcomes.  Kaufman currently works with a variety of organizations around the globe implementing the Mega Planning model for strategic organizational planning, including educational institutions, government organizations, and corporations.

== Brief Bio ==
Kaufman was born and raised in Washington D.C. The son of a mathematical physicist/electrical engineer, Kaufman credits his father's influence for how he has approached his work. In a recent interview with Stephanie Moore, Kaufman explained how there are both two kinds of calculus  - differential and integral. First we learn to differentiate, then we learn but don't always apply integration.  This began to drive him to look for how everything integrates, "how it all goes together," which led him to develop his Mega model and the Organizational Elements Model (OEM) that links three levels of results with two levels of resources and methods. Kaufman's bachelor's  degree from [[George Washington University]] in Psychology, Sociology and Statistics. He completed a Master's at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in Psychology and Industrial Engineering.  This foundation in both psychology and industrial engineering, along with his emphasis on statistics and social sciences, played a significant role the development his Mega planning model for measurable societal value added as a strategic planning model for organizations.  Kaufman completed his doctorate in Communications at [[New York University]].  He previously spent time at [[University of California, Berkeley]] completing additional doctoral work in Industrial/Organizational Psychology.

Kaufman's professional work has been in multiple industries.  Prior to his academic positions, he worked for aerospace organizations including Martin-Baltimore (now Lockheed), [[Boeing]] and [[Douglas Aircraft Company]] primarily focused on human factors, training, and research.  In 1998, he established Roger Kaufman &amp; Associates, a team of human performance professionals who consult with organizations on strategic planning and performance improvement. Upon completion of his doctorate, Kaufman taught at several universities, [[UC Irvine]] (adjunct professor), [[Chapman University]] (Professor of Education), [[United States International University]] (Professor of Psychology and Human Behavior), [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] (Research Professor of Engineering Management), and [[University of Central Florida]] (Industrial engineer faculty Affiliate).  From 1997-2004, Kaufman contributed at [[Old Dominion University]] as Research Professor of Engineering Management.

Concurrently with most of this work, Kaufman was a professor at [[Florida State University]] (FSU), from 1975–2003, for the position he would eventually be awarded professor emeritus status in Educational Psychology and Learning Systems and awarded the Professorial Excellence Award.  While at FSU, Kaufman established and directed the Center for Educational Development and Evaluation and also served as Director of the Office of Needs Assessment and Planning all with the Learning Systems Institute.  During his time at FSU he worked on numerous initiatives for the state of Florida on needs assessment, evaluation, and societal planning, including work with the Florida Department of Education, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Florida Division of Blind Services, Division of Adult &amp; Community Education, the Governor's office,and the United States Navy (Chief of Naval Education &amp; Training/Office of Naval Research) - to name just a few.  In August, 2004, he became Distinguished Research Professor at [[Sonora Institute of Technology]] (ITSON) in Sonora, Mexico.

Kaufman has been the recipient of numerous professional awards including Fellow ([[American Psychology Association]]), Fellow ([[American Educational Research Association]]), Fellow of the American Educational Research Association, Distinguished Contribution to Workplace Learning and Performance (ASTD), and Meritorious Public Service Medal (US Coast Guard/Department of Homeland Security).  He was co-founder of what is now the International Society for Performance Improvement (ISPI).  He has received 14 awards from the association including Significant Contribution Award, and Honorary Member-for-Life (their highest honor).  He has served as President of ISPI and founded the New York Chapter of the association.  Kaufman has published over 275 articles and 41 books on strategic planning, change management, needs assessment, assessment, evaluation and organizational improvement.

== Needs Assessment ==
One of the defining characteristics of Kaufman's work is his emphasis on "need" as a noun, not a verb; it is a gap in results and consequences, not a gap in resources or methods. Kaufman explains when "need" is used as a verb, it presupposes a solution before identifying the actual problem to be solved. When using 'need' as a verb, an intervention has been selected prior to a clear definition of the actual gap in results that would be addressed.  Once a gap, or need, is accurately identified, only then can a means be sensibly selected for moving from current to desired results.

Kaufman expanded this approach to "need" from looking at gaps in products to gaps in outputs and then outcomes: from building block results to results delivered outside the organization to external client and societal results - what the organization used, does, produces, and delivers and the consequences all of that adds measurable value for our shared society. Used in this way, cost-consequences estimates may be made to prioritize closing gaps on the basis of the cost to meet the need as compared to the costs to ignore the need.

Kaufman identified three types, or levels, of needs: Mega, Macro, and Micro.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, R. (2000, 2006). Mega Planning: Practical Tools for Organizational Success. Thousand Oaks, CA. Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; And ''Change, Choices, and Consequences'' published by HRD Press. The following table details the levels of needs and their definitions.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Name of the Organizational Element &amp; Level of Planning
! Brief Description
|-
| Outcomes/Mega	
| Results and their consequences for external clients and society
|-
| Outputs/Macro	
| The results an organization can or does deliver outside of itself
|-
| Products/Micro	
| The building-block results that are produced within the organization
|-
| Processes		
| The ways, means, activities, procedures and methods used internally
|-
| Inputs		
| The human, physical, and financial resources and organization can or does use
|}

These levels of needs are also levels of planning for any organization and indicate a relationship between the levels.  Alignment of objectives at each level is critical to ensure that planning translates into clear organizational operations and ensure that activities at each level add value back up the chain linking measurable to societal value-added.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, S.L., Ellsworth, J., and Kaufman, R. (2008).  Objectives: Are they useful?  A Quick Assessment. Performance Improvement, 47(7), 41-47.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, no level of results is any more important than the others. Rather, it is the alignment of all levels that is critical to achieving desired results.

Extensive examples of planning and aligned objectives can be found in Moore, 2010 and Moore, Ellsworth &amp; Kaufman, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, S.L. (2010). Ethics by Design: A new definition of performance standards and performance accountability.  HRD Press.

== Mega Planning ==

Kaufman has developed a model for strategic thinking and planning he calls "Mega Planning."  Kaufman argues that many organizational planning models incorrectly begin, and end, with internal or organizational performance and therefore fail to provide organizations a chance to plan how they deliver value outside of their organizations.  Traditional planning ends with "Macro" level results, which are organizational results such as profits, graduation rates, ratings, etc.  While these are important measures of organizational performance, they do not indicate the impact of an organization on external clients and society. Kaufman's model is similar to some of the concepts behind "[[double bottom line]]" literature.

"Mega Planning" starts with the question of "What kind of world do you want for your children and grand-children?" with responses distilled in terms of consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Muir, M., Watkins, R. Kaufman, R., &amp; Leigh, D. (1998: Apr.).  Costs-Consequences Analysis: A Primer. Performance Improvement, 37 (4), 8-17, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; An Ideal Vision defines the measurable variables for Mega planning including survival, self-sufficiency, and quality of life.  He calls Mega planning (a system approach) "Mother's Rule" because if you ask just about any mother what kind of world they want for their children, they don't talk to means (credentials of teachers, money spent on social programs) but the survival, health, and happiness of their children.

=== Basic Ideal Vision for Society - indicators for societal well-being ===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! BASIC IDEAL VISION:
The world we want to help create for tomorrow’s child
|-
| There will be no losses of life nor elimination or reduction of levels of well-being, survival, self-sufficiency, and quality of life from any source, including (but not limited to):
* War and/or riot and/or terrorism
* Unintended human-caused changes to the environment including permanent destruction of the environment and/or rendering it nonrenewable
* Murder, rape, or crimes of violence, robbery, or destruction to property
* Substance abuse
* Disease
* Pollution
* Starvation and/or malnutrition
* Destructive behavior, including child, partner, spouse, self, elder, and others
* Discrimination based on irrelevant variable including color, race, age, creed, gender, religion, wealth, national origin, or location
Poverty will not exist, and every woman and man will earn at least as much as it costs them to live unless they are progressing toward being self-sufficient and self-reliant.  No adult will be under the care, custody or control of another person, agency, or substance.  All adult citizens will be self-sufficient and self-reliant as minimally indicated by their consumption being equal to or less than their production.''
This becomes the basis for defining a vision and mission statement that map out exactly how an organization, of any type, will add measurable value to society. Kaufman's models is argued to be the first model for business planning that makes the business case for social responsibility and that establishes a data-based construct for organizational planning and evaluation that goes beyond the walls of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Bernardez, M. (May–June, 2009). Sailing the Winds of “Creative Destruction:” Educational Technology during economic downturns. Educational Technology.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bernardez, M. (2009). Minding the Business of Business: Tools and Models to Design and Measure Wealth Creation. Performance Improvement Quarterly. 22(2) Pp. 17-72.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work by McKinsey &amp; Co's Ian Davis (the Economist, 2005) aligns with this concept. The model was developed over many years, and cross multiple countries and cultures, to validate the measures.  Moore conducted a factor and reliability analysis of the construct, finding that all measures loaded onto a single factor (i.e. described a single concept), r=.95 (a notably high reliability).&lt;ref&gt;Moore, S. L. (2005). The social impact of a profession: An analysis of factors influencing ethics and the teaching of social responsibility in educational technology programs. Unpublished Doctor of Philosophy dissertation, University of Northern Colorado.&lt;/ref&gt;
Kaufman's model has sometimes been referred to as "Kirkpatrick Plus" - an extension of [[Donald Kirkpatrick|Kirkpatrick]]'s Four Levels of Evaluation&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, R., Leigh, D., Foshay, R. and Kaufman, R. (1998). Kirkpatrick Plus: Evaluation and Continuous Improvement with a Community Focus.  Educational Technology Research &amp; Development, 46(4): 90-96.&lt;/ref&gt; by adding Mega—societal value added as a fifth level. However, the debate over this is a rather long-standing one. Some practitioners in the field argue that the fifth level of evaluation is ROI, or "return on investment," evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, J.J. (1997).  Return on Investment in Training and Performance Improvement Programs. Butterworth-Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt; (ROI is still a measure of organizational performance internally, however, and does not measure what the impact of an organization is on society).

Not all researchers agree with the idea that a systemic Ideal Vision can be engineered with such limited background knowledge.  For example [[Boise State University]] Professor Don Winiecki argued that efforts at social engineering from the commonsense position proposed by Kaufman lose sight of possible side-effects and tertiary-effects from chosen means, thus of corrupting or mitigating desired ends.  Winiecki asks for research that goes beyond rational laboratory experiments and ideologically informed generalizations of commonsense reasoning, in order to better understand the socio-cultural, socio-political and socio-economic systems in which social changes must be instituted.&lt;ref&gt;Winiecki, D. J. (2004) Rejoinder to “Saving the World With HPT” A Critical, Scientific and Consultative Reflection. Performance Improvement review, ISPI. September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a  response to this, Professor Emeritus Dale Brethower ([[Western Michigan University]]) argued to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Brethower, D. M. (2005: Feb.). Yes We Can: A Rejoinder to Don Winiecki’s Rejoinder About Saving the World with HPT. Performance Improvement. Vol. 44, No. 2. Pp. 19-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufman argues that since the Ideal Vision was derived by unsystematically asking culturally and geographically diverse populations "what kind of world do you want to help create for tomorrow's child" it is relatively universal. The differences continue to be discussed.

== Examples / Case Studies of Applied Mega ==
At the [[Sonora Institute of Technology]] (ITSON) in Sonora, Mexico, Kaufman and colleagues have worked with the President of the Institute to create a certification, Master's degree, and Ph.D. based on needs assessment and Mega planning.  Students at the Ph.D. level must be working in a company or head of a company and must apply the Mega principles in a real-world project.  Evidence of ITSON's results were first described by Guerra and Rodriguez.&lt;ref&gt;Guerra, I. and Rodriguez, G. (2005). Educational Planning and Social Responsibility:  Eleven Years of Mega Planning at the Sonora Institute of Technology (ITSON). Performance Improvement Quarterly, 18(3) pp. 56-64.&lt;/ref&gt; ITSON also set up a Performance Improvement Institute for applied R&amp;D where there are currently 20 organizations applying Mega thinking and planning.

Other applications include with the US Coast Guard, Concientia (Argentina), Ohio Department of Administration and the Ohio public employees union, the Australian Department of Defense, the New Zealand Army, the Republic of Panama, Refinor de Argentina, among 100+ public and private organizations committed to adding value to all internal and external clients.

'''Rose Lambert''' (September 8, 1878 – December 27, 1974) was an American missionary in the [[Ottoman Empire]] who was the Matron of the orphanage at the town of [[Hadjin]] during and after the 1909 massacres of Armenians in Cilicia. Her accounts of the Hadjin siege and [[Adana massacre]] provide an important insight into these events.

==Early life==
Rose Lambert was born on September 8, 1878, in [[Lehigh County]], [[Pennsylvania]], and was the daughter of George and Amanda Lambert.&lt;ref name=tree /&gt; Her father was a minister in the [[Missionary Church|Mennonite Brethren in Christ Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Mennonite Brethren in Christ Church |editor=Jasper Abraham Huffman |page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from the Deaconess Hospital in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], and then became a teacher in Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shavit|first=David|title=The United States in the Middle East: a historical dictionary|year=1988|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York|isbn=0313253412|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Turkish mission ==
On November 12, 1898, Lambert went to Ottoman [[Turkey]] to work among the Armenian orphans of the [[Hamidian Massacres]]. She arrived in [[Hadjin]] on December 28 and by autumn of 1899 she had 175 orphans under her care.&lt;ref name=mennonite /&gt; Eventually, two orphanages were opened, one for boys and another for girls.&lt;ref name=mennonite /&gt; By 1905, the total number of orphans reached 305.&lt;ref name=mennonite&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Mennonite Brethren in Christ Church|year=1920|publisher=Bethel Publishing Company|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w4USAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq|editor=Jasper Abraham Huffman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1908, the Ittihad or [[Young Turks]] movement overthrew Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] and declared the return of constitutional rule, promising equality for all citizens of Turkey regardless of religion.&lt;ref name=lambert_p30&gt;Lambert, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The improved status of Armenians and other Christian groups under the new regime caused alarm among some provincial Turkish leaders, who feared the loss of their relatively privileged position in society.&lt;ref name=frey_p77&gt;Frey, [https://books.google.com/books?id=m569AfPJkB4C&amp;pg=PA369&amp;dq=%22adana+massacre%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xa8lUp_GFcWRkwWW34CoDg&amp;ved=0CKgBEOgBMBY#v=onepage&amp;q=%22adana%20massacre%22&amp;f=false p. 77].&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 April 1909, a countercoup occurred and Hamid II was briefly returned to power, but although the countercoup collapsed after only a few days, turmoil continued throughout the country.&lt;ref name=frey_p77/&gt; Rumours that Armenians were planning an insurrection&lt;ref name=kerr_p7&gt;Kerr, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eFln8mXSKwoC&amp;pg=PA309&amp;dq=%22adana+massacre%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2_r4UfOBMMuXkwWWr4GoBw&amp;ved=0CHMQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22adana%20massacre%22&amp;f=false p. 7.]&lt;/ref&gt; or that they were committing atrocities against Turks,&lt;ref name=lambert_p44&gt;Lambert, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; spread through the countryside, and shortly after the launch of Hamid's coup, fighting broke out between Turkish and Armenian residents of [[Adana]],&lt;ref name=lambert_p99&gt;Lambert, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; which quickly turned into [[Adana massacre|a massacre of Armenians]] in the town and surrounding villages. News of killings of Armenians soon reached the neighbouring town of Hadjin, where Lambert was still employed in her missionary work, through telegrams and via a trickle of refugees.&lt;ref name="lambert_ch_iv, p_44"&gt;Lambert, Chapter IV; p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the central government unable to restore order in the provinces for several weeks, Hadjin found itself under prolonged siege from armed Turkish villagers&lt;ref name=lambert_ch_v/&gt;&amp;mdash;many of them equipped with modern [[Martini rifle]]s.&lt;ref name=lambert_p33&gt;Lambert, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Adana however&amp;mdash;a city on a plain with a substantial Armenian minority&amp;mdash;Hadjin, as an ethnically homogenous town of some 20,000 Armenians situated high in the mountains, was a much more defensible locality.&lt;ref name=lambert-pp24-26&gt;Lambert, pp. 24–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Hadjin was in a perilous position as its residents were poorly armed and isolated from help, and throughout the siege, they made frantic efforts via telegraph and messenger to enlist aid both from the central government and foreign embassies.&lt;ref name=lambert_ch_v&gt;Lambert, Chapter V.&lt;/ref&gt; Matters were further complicated by the fact that the defence of the town was apparently misinterpreted by some in the central government not as a defence but as a rebellion.&lt;ref name=lambert_pp46-47,60&gt;Lambert, pp. 46–47, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the siege, Lambert became an important source of news to the outside world, as her reports of the massacres and the plight of the Hadjin Armenians, telegraphed to the American consulate, were published in the ''New York Times''. For example, in one telegram published in the ''Times'' on April 23, 1909, Lambert wrote: {{quote|Hadjin has been surrounded for a week by the villagers of this district, who are awaiting the opportunity to storm the place. All roads are closed, and shots are being fired into the town irregularly. The dwellings on the outskirts have been burned. The authorities at Adana have been appealed to for aid, which has not been sent. A rumor from the outside says that an assault will be made on this place to-night.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes&gt;{{cite news|title=American Women in Peril in Hadjin|url=http://www.teachgenocide.org/files/Newsaccounts/NYT%20Articles/NYT%20Article%20-%20April%2023,%201909.pdf|accessdate=3 July 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 23, 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Norah_and_Rose_Lambert.jpg|thumb|right|Norah and Rose Lambert (photograph taken around 1909)]]

A telegram was then sent from Lambert on April 26 and arrived to the United States on April 28. The telegram read in part:
{{quote|The rising against the Christians of Hadjin began nine days ago. The Government sent troops to suppress the fighting between Mohammedans and Christians, but the men were not strong enough numerically to restore order. Many are dead and wounded on both sides.

Desperados occupied the Armenian cloister five days ago, and have been firing on the people without interruption since ... Many shops have been robbed and others undoubtedly will be. The Armenian settlements and villages in the province have been burned and many persons killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HADJIN ALMOST WITHOUT FOOD.: News Received from Miss Lambert, Whose First Messenger Was Killed.|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 29, 1909|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/04/29/101878821.pdf|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lambert later wrote a book entitled ''Hadjin and the Armenian Massacres'', where she gave a more detailed account of her experiences in Hadjin during the 1909 turmoil. Lambert states that, though fired upon day and night, Hadjin's defenders were instructed not to shoot directly at their attackers unless absolutely necessary, as it was anticipated that the more Turks killed during the defence, the harsher would be retribution from the authorities and the Armenians' Turkish neighbours in the aftermath.&lt;ref name=lambert_pp77-78&gt;Lambert, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Lambert also relates how after many attempts to raise the alarm, a regiment of 300 soldiers was despatched from Fekka ([[Feke]]) to end the siege, but instead of dispersing the besiegers, the regiment apparently joined them.&lt;ref name=lambert_p47&gt;Lambert, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, after several weeks, the British consul, who had been informed of the siege by telegraph, was able to organize a relief force of a Turkish regiment led by a reliable officer, which quickly dispersed the besiegers and restored order.&lt;ref name=lambert_pp66,78-81&gt;Lambert, pp. 66, 78–81.&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this point that news of the massacre of up to 30,000 Armenians in the neighbouring locality of Adana reached Hadjin. Lambert wrote: {{quote|Scarcely had the regiment arrived when news reached us of the awful massacre on the plain. Many Christian villages were completely wiped out and not one Armenian left alive. Where there was a mixed population the Armenian quarter was usually destroyed but here and there were places where no great harm was done simply because the officer in charge would not consent to it.

Widows and orphans by the hundreds came flocking back to Hadjin and the villages about us, from the plain, bereft of beloved ones, many of whom had been brutally massacred before their eyes. They were penniless, ragged, barefooted, sick, pale and almost beyond recognition, the mothers, wives, sisters and daughters of the three thousand Hadjin men who had been massacred on the plain.&lt;ref name=lambert_p104&gt;Lambert, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Aftermath ==
[[File:AdanaChristianQuarter.jpg|thumbnail|A street in the Christian quarter of Adana after the massacres (photographed in June 1909)]]
With the siege ended, martial law was established and "a number of the principal village Turks were called to give an account of their deeds."&lt;ref name=lambert_pp81-82&gt;Lambert, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; In their defence, these men testified that they had been driven to violence by false reports of Armenian atrocities and humiliations, and all, according to Lambert, were subsequently pardoned after being given "a little advice".&lt;ref name=lambert_pp81-82/&gt; In contrast with the lenient treatment extended to local Turkish offenders, 70 of the Armenian defenders of Hadjin, including the mayor and his son, city councillors, local defence leaders, and even those who supplied provisions to the defenders including the baker, were imprisoned in harsh conditions awaiting trial, some of them allegedly tortured to extract confessions. While most were released after a few months, several received ten-year jail sentences.&lt;ref name=lambert_pp83-84&gt;Lambert, pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lambert's book closes with a number of personal stories related to her by survivors of the massacres. Of particular interest to Lambert was the fate of a number of her associates, including "our ministers, delegates, deacons, merchants and the head teacher in our girls' orphanage, numbering seventy-six in all."&lt;ref name=lambert_p88&gt;Lambert, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; According to testimony supplied to Lambert, this group, after falling into the hands of a local Turkish leader, were initially promised protection in return for surrendering all their weapons and other possessions, but on doing so were brutally slaughtered by their captors.&lt;ref name=lambert_pp88-90&gt;Lambert, pp. 88–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lambert concludes her book as follows:

{{quote|Space will not permit me to write in detail of the many who were crucified, thrown into the river, killed with swords and axes, burned by the thousands in the churches or in their homes, and of the many who were tortured and killed in such hideous and awful ways that dare not be repeated, but it is estimated that in the vilayet of Adana between twenty and thirty thousand were slain and months later the plain was still strewn with their bones. On our trip to the coast, while resting under the large shade trees for a few moments, Armenian hands gathered the skulls and bones of their fellow countrymen and laid them at our feet.&lt;ref name=lambert_p104&gt;Lambert, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To a friend, she wrote: "I did my utmost for [the Armenians] and at the time felt it would be much easier to be with the martyrs than to live with the memories of the atrocities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reber|first=Elaine Sommers Rich ; foreword by Barbara K.

==Later life==
Lambert returned to the United States in 1910, and married Texas rancher David Musselman the following year, on October 4, 1911.&lt;ref name=tree /&gt; They had five children, David, George, Paul, Rose and John.&lt;ref name=tree&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Tree of Gehman's|url=http://www.bfchistory.org/gehmangenrep.htm|publisher=Bible Fellowship Church Online History Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose Lambert Musselmann died in 1974 at the age of 96 and is buried at the Memorial Park Cemetery in [[Victoria County, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rose L.

The [[Royal Society of London]] '''Michael Faraday Prize''' is awarded for "excellence in communicating science to UK audiences".&lt;ref name="rs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=1783 |title=The Royal Society Michael Faraday Prize (1986) |publisher=Royal Society |accessdate=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Named after [[Michael Faraday]], the medal itself is made of silver gilt, and is accompanied by a purse of £2500. 

==Background==
The prize was first awarded in 1986 to Charles Taylor for "his outstanding presentations of physics and applications of physics, aimed at audiences from six-year-old primary school children to adults".&lt;ref name="rs"/&gt; It is awarded annually and unlike other Royal Society awards such as the [[Hughes Medal]], it has been presented every year since its inception.  The winner is required to present a lecture as part of the Society's annual programme of public events, which is usually held in January of the following year; during the lecture, the President of the Royal Society awards the medal.&lt;ref name="rs3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=1826 |title=Michael Faraday Prize notes for proposers |publisher=Royal Society |accessdate=19 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other prizes awarded by the society, the committee has not always publicly provided a rationale. This has occurred five times—in 2004 to [[Martin Rees]], in 2006 to [[Richard Fortey]], in 2007 to [[Jim Al-Khalili]],  in 2008 to [[John D. Barrow]] and most recently in 2009 to [[Marcus du Sautoy]].&lt;ref name="rs"/&gt;

The '''Schools Sites Act of 1841''' (4 &amp; 5 Vict. c. 38) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] (the [[long title]] of which is ''An Act to afford further Facilities for the Conveyance and Endowment of Sites for Schools'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Schools Sites Act 1841 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/4-5/38/introduction |website=www.legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=4 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allowed land-owners to sell or donate a maximum of one [[acre]] of land to [[charities]] for the provision of schooling 'poor persons'. The act covered [[England]] and [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] was also covered until the [[Education (Scotland) Act 1942]] (although any donated land in Scotland under the act prior to this was not affected by the latter act).

The act was invoked 164 years later on 27 October 2005, in the case of [http://www.fraserandfraser.com Fraser &amp; Fraser] v. Canterbury Diocesan Board of Finance. It was found that the [[Church of England]] had sold land given under the act (mostly for residential developments) and had kept the proceeds, despite a provision in the act that required funds raised from selling the land to be given back the family of the original donator should the land cease to be used for educational purposes. The [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] then declared the money be given to the descendants of the original donator of the land as the act required. Fraser &amp; Fraser appeared on the [[BBC One]] TV programme ''[[Heir Hunters]]''.

''WACOM'' was an international project undertaken through the [[European Union|European Union's]] [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013|Lifelong Learning Programme]], specifically the [[Leonardo da Vinci programme]]. As such, the '''WACOM''' project primarily deals with initial and continuing [[vocational education and training]] (VET) in the European Union. 

This model was established through the [[European Quality Framework|EQF]] in combination with the German Reference Model for Competence Modeling PAS 1093.

== Overview ==

Due to the shortage of the precious resource water and the consequences of the climate change, numerous European policies have been developed and adopted for the protection and sustainable utilisation of water, creating a huge demand in vocational training.&lt;ref&gt;[[Water supply and sanitation in the European Union]]&lt;/ref&gt; Economic factors like privatisation and increasing cost pressure in water management are further increasing these educational needs, leading to the demand for VET opportunities and products that are as short and tailor‐made as possible.
The situation of vocational training in water management was addressed by the WACOM instrument, which attempted to define the needed [[Competence (human resources)|competences]] and qualifications for the different tasks, working places and employees within the water sector. In this way, WACOM strove to lead to a supposed increase in the volume of mobility throughout Europe as well as to a higher transparency and recognition of qualifications and competences. The project aimed at creating general as well as particular modular VET opportunities and products in the water management concerning the addressed competences and qualifications. Through this, the VET opportunities and products were able to be related and mapped to those competences and qualifications for the management of sewage treatment plants. 

In addition, the competence and qualification model offers the basis for the individual identification of missing competences and qualifications, i.e. of clearly limited VET needs. WACOM also supported the European comparability and recognition of vocational training through the combination with credit points ([[ECVET]]) and thus mobility. Next to numerous dissemination activities, WACOM looked in particular for input into the national VET systems and for launching a European Norm initiative as contribution to the European standardisation ([[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]]). Furthermore, the transfer into other sectors and all European countries was carried out through a focus on pilot‐testing, optimization, dissemination, exploitation and sustainable strategies.

== WACOM Main Objectives ==

The overall objective of WACOM was the development and transfer of a reference model for [[Competence (human resources)|competence modelling]] into the water sector of the partner countries, enabling the identification of the VET needs by the employees and learners of required competences and qualifications at specific working places as well as of the improvement of transparency and comparability of VET opportunities and products.

- To support participants in training and further training activities in the acquisition and the use of knowledge, skills and qualifications to facilitate personal development

- To support improvements in quality and innovation in vocational education and training systems, institutions and practices

- To enhance the attractiveness of vocational education and training and mobility for employers and individuals and to facilitate the mobility of working trainees&lt;ref&gt;WACOM Project Website ({{cite web |url=http://www.wacom-project.eu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403011646/http://www.wacom-project.eu/ |archivedate=3 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief description of the WACOM products ==

The development of the WACOM instrument was supported by the transfer of the competence and qualification model into the water sector and by the adaptation for the selected topic management of sewage treatment plants. WACOM influences vocational training in water management and in additional sectors.

The main WACOM products and affects were:

1. "Competence model for the water sector"

Development of WACOM (the WAter COmpetences Model) as the establishment of a competence model for the water sector based on EQF and PAS 1093: the aim was the foundation of the vocational training on the principle of competence modelling based on the identification of the specific demands and needs of the water management and existing practice concerning competence models in the water sector. The experiences gained through the testing of this model aid the plans of other European research projects which also use competence models, such as the [[Agricom]] Project or the [[Compat.egov|Compat.egov Project]].

2. "WACOM instrument"

Optimization and adaptation of WACOM (the WAter COmpetences Model) to the vocational education and training systems and cultures in Europe. Finally the WACOM instrument was used for the description of the competences and qualifications and for the improvement of their transparency and comparability.

== End-of-Project Conferences ==

Two conferences were carried out in order to open the results of the WACOM project for discussion to a larger audience, the 4th European Conference "Innovations in the Environmental Sector" (INES)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INES Website|url=http://www.learning-innovations.eu|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the European Conference "Competence Modelling for the Water Sector",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CM for Water Sector Website|url=http://www.wacom-project.eu/?q=WACOM_Conference_Competence_Modeling|accessdate=3 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203063906/http://www.wacom-project.eu/?q=WACOM_Conference_Competence_Modeling#|archive-date=3 December 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which took place in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] on 21 September 2011.

===Studio Based Learning===

Walden's Path | The Magnet School follows Studio-Based Learning and is inspired by John Dewey’s work and education philosophy. Unlike a lab that uses standardized procedures with set equipment to reproduce a protocol in order to obtain set outcomes, a Studio is a space that invigorates, inspires and provides an opportunity to create, construct and test objectives and hypotheses and analyse data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Studio Based Learning|url=https://www.magnetschool.edu.in/studio-based-learning/|website=www.magnetschool.edu.in|publisher=The Magnet School|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Conference Against Racism''' ('''WCAR''') is a series of international events organized by [[UNESCO]] to promote [[anti-racism|struggle against racism]] ideologies and behaviours. Four conferences have been held so far, in 1978, 1983, 2001, and 2009. Founded after [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]] as a dependent body of the United Nations, UNESCO started as soon as it was created to promote scientific studies concerning [[ethnic group]]s and their diffusion in [[public opinion]] to dispel [[scientific racism|pseudo-scientific rationalizations]] of racism. One of its first published works was ''[[The Race Question]]'' in 1950, signed by various internationally renowned scholars.

== 1978 conference ==

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The 1978 World Conference Against Racism was held in [[Geneva]], Switzerland.  A major focus on the conference was South Africa's [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid policies]] of racial segregation and discrimination.

== 1983 conference ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The 1983 World Conference Against Racism was also held in [[Geneva]], Switzerland

== 2001 conference ==
{{Main|World Conference against Racism 2001}}

The 2001 conference was held in [[Durban]], South Africa, under UN auspices, from 31 August until 8 September 2001. Former Irish president [[Mary Robinson]], then the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, presided as Secretary-General. 

Entitled "World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance," the conference was discussing unfair treatment of one group against another.  Significant time was focused specifically on Israeli treatment of Palestinians{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}, treating violations of human rights and genocide in other parts of the world secondarily.

The 2001 meeting was marked by clashes over the Middle East and the legacy of slavery, and coincided with attacks on Israel and anti-Israel demonstrations at a parallel conference of non-governmental organizations. Canada, followed by the U.S. and Israel walked out midway through the 2001 conference over a draft resolution that, in their opinion, singled out Israel for criticism and likened [[Zionism]] to racism. The European Union also refused to accept demands by Arab states to criticize Israel for "racist practices." [https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h-NABlEjaGSsDBh_qdpdNmX7V6VwD96M0PV00]

Also in the conference, African countries, led by Nigeria and Zimbabwe, and African-American NGOs wanted individual apologies from each of the countries responsible for [[slavery]], recognition of it as a [[crime against humanity]], and reparations called as such. The Europeans pulled together behind the UK and the best the Africans could get was a call for support for the [[New African Initiative]], debt relief, funds to combat AIDS, the recovery of stolen government funds transferred to the West by former dictators and their cohorts, and an end to the [[human trafficking|trafficking in people]]. But the word 'reparations' did not survive.

Within a day of learning that the draft was not ready, they announced they were joining the boycott. See:
* {{cite news|last=Levin|first=Naomi|title=Smith: Why the Durban decision took so long|work=[[The Australian Jewish News]]|place=Melbourne|volume=75|issue=29|page=3|date=24 April 2009}}
* [http://jta.org/news/article/2009/03/17/1003772/australia-ready-to-boycott-durban-ii Australia ready to boycott Durban II]&lt;/ref&gt; announced they would not participate in the conference.

Mark Mardell of the BBC news reported: On the Monday the Conference was to begin, Italian Foreign Minister [[Franco Frattini]] (who was until last year the [[European Commissioner]] for security and justice) had told the Italian newspaper ''Il Giornale'' that Europe's failure to agree on a common approach was "a very serious mistake, because it shows our inability, despite all the words uttered in this connection, to come up with at least a lowest common denominator on a basic problem: namely the struggle against discrimination, on behalf of which we in Brussels so often speak out".

Frattini continued, "I should imagine that a compromise was preferred at any price. And this, despite the fact that in the documents prepared for the rendezvous in Geneva, apart from a few minor improvements, a basic approach has been maintained equating Israel with a racist country rather than a democracy. There are still unacceptable phrases which, if there had been a smidgen of consistency with what was said at the EU ministers' meeting, should have convinced people to forgo attending the conference – as we have decided to do, and as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and The Netherlands have decided to do." (Mark Mardell, BBC News)

New Zealand's Foreign Minister Murray McCully said he was not satisfied that the wording of the review would prevent the conference from "descending into the same kind of rancorous and unproductive debate that took place in 2001," and he reported that he was concerned that it could be used by Muslim countries to criticize Israel and to limit free speech when it comes to criticizing their religion. (reported by the Associated Press on 20 April)

On the opening day of the conference, France said that Europeans would walk out if Ahmadinejad made any anti-Semitic remarks. "We will have to be very clear. We will not tolerate any slips," French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner told France Info. "If he utters racist or anti-Semitic accusations, we will leave the room immediately."&lt;ref name="rfi.fr"/&gt;

Germany had decided to stay away from the meeting amid western concerns that the event may take on anti-Semitic overtones, a senior official confirmed in Berlin Thursday.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com" /&gt;

In his opening address, Secretary-General of UN [[Ban Ki-Moon]] said, "Some nations who by rights should be helping us to forge a path to a better future are not here. Outside these halls, interest groups of many political and ideological stripes shout against one another in acrimony."&lt;ref name="rfi.fr"/&gt;

Later in the day, about 40 delegates walked out during Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's speech after he described Israel as a "racist government" and attacked the creation of the state of Israel.  France, which had warned of a walkout, described it as "hate speech", the BBC reported.

The walkout was a public relations disaster for the United Nations,&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; which had hoped the conference would be a shining example of what the UN is supposed to do best: uniting to combat injustice in the world, said the BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva. Her colleague [[Jeremy Paxman]] described the walkout as a "stunt", arguing that people should have the right to criticise [[Zionism]].

President Ahmadinejad, the only major leader to attend the conference, said Jewish migrants from Europe and the United States had been sent to the Middle East after World War II "in order to establish a racist government in the occupied Palestine".  He continued, through an interpreter: "And in fact, in compensation for the dire consequences of racism in Europe, they helped bring to power the most cruel and repressive racist regime in Palestine."  French Ambassador Jean-Baptiste Mattei said: "As soon as he started to address the question of the Jewish people and Israel, we had no reason to stay in the room."&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Walkout at Iran leader's speech|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8008572.stm|accessdate=25 January 2011|publisher=BBC|date=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

British ambassador [[Peter Gooderham]], also among those who left, said Mr Ahmadinejad's comments were "offensive and inflammatory".  "Such outrageous anti-Semitic remarks should have no place in a UN anti-racism forum", he announced to gathered reporters.  (BBC News)

'''Yoryi Morel''' (born '''Jorge Octavio Morel Tavárez'''; 25 October 1906,&amp;ndash;1979) was a painter from the [[Dominican Republic]]. Along with [[Jaime Colson]] and [[Darío Suro]], he is considered one of the founders of the modernist school of Dominican painting.

==Life and career==
Morel was born in [[Santiago de los Caballeros]], the son of Enrique Morel Bocanegra and Ana Teresa Tavárez Cabreja. He spent most of his career in [[Santiago Province (Dominican Republic)|Santiago Province]]. 

Although he began his art studies at the age of 11 at [[Fine art|Bellas Artes]] with his mentor and also his teacher [[Juan Bautista Gómez]], he is generally considered to be self-taught. Morel for many years was devoted to teaching in [[Dominican Republic]] . His teachings influenced several generations of Dominicans artist such as [[Ney Cruz]], he was leading Dominican ''[[costumbrista]]'' painter and is known for his [[landscape art|landscapes]], genre paintings, and [[portrait painting|portraits]].

Morel held his first solo exhibition in [[Santo Domingo]] in 1932. In 1940, he founded the "Yoryi" Academy, a fine-arts school in Santiago de los Caballeros , which was attended by [[Clara Ledesma]]. He participated in the Dominican Republic's first biennial art exhibition in 1942, and won first prize in the sixth biennial in 1952. 

== Awards ==
He was declared the "Pintor Nacional" (national painter) by the [[Congress of the Dominican Republic|Dominican Congress]] on October 25, 2006.

Morel was also appointed Deputy Director of the National School of Fine Art in 1948 and was honored by the Dominican government in 1973 with the “[[Order of Merit of Duarte, Sánchez and Mella]]” and the rank of "Caballero."

Two retrospectives were held to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth: ''Por los Caminos de Nuestra Expresión'' at the [[Museo Bellapart]] in Santo Domingo in 2006 and ''Autonomía y Trascendencia'' at Centro León in Santiago de los Caballeros in 2007.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
He married [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] Ilonka Szabó, daughter of Károly Szabó and Szanet Czeglédy, with whom he had three children: Jorge Enrique Morel Szabó (1946), Janos Laszlo Morel Szabó (1949), and Ilonka Morel Szabó (1954). He also had two daughters from a previous relationship with Rosa Flete: Yolanda Antonia Morel Flete (1943) and Filomena Morel Flete.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;
