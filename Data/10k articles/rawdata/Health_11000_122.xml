'''Alice Copping''' (14 May 1906 &amp;ndash; 16 January 1996&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=877556&amp;fileId=S0007114596001249 An Appreciation: Alice Mary Copping&lt;/ref&gt;) was senior lecturer in nutrition, [[Queen Elizabeth College]], [[University of London]]. She was born in [[Stratford, New Zealand]].

Copping attended [[Victoria University of Wellington]], [[New Zealand]], and graduated as Master of Science in 1926. She was awarded the Sarah Ann Rhodes scholarship the following year, and did two years of research work under J. C. Drummond at [[University College London]]. She then returned to New Zealand to lecture at the School of Home Science, [[University of Otago]] for a year, before returning to London to work in the Division of Nutrition at the Lister Institute.

Copping was employed as the editorial assistant of the periodical Nutrition Abstracts and Reviews from its inception in 1931, and for a period of nearly 20 years worked solidly for the Institute on research on topics such as [[Vitamin B complex]], [[bread]] and [[wheat]] products, and wartime diets.

In 1949 she was employed on the staff of Queen Elizabeth College, and became a senior lecturer during her time there. Copping was a consultant on nutrition education for the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]/[[World Health Organization]] symposium in 1959, and in 1961 acted as chairman of programme for the Third International Congress of Dietetics in London.

When Thiam was young, his father was government minister and the ambassador to [[Morocco]]. Thiam is also the grandnephew of [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]], Ivory Coast's first president. Thiam was trained as a medical doctor at the [[Université de Cocody]] and worked in public hospitals until 1989. He moved to [[Paris]] where he worked as a journalist. He returned to Ivory Coast in 1993 after the death of Houphouët-Boigny.

A '''bimalleolar fracture''' is a [[Fracture (bone)|fracture]] of the [[ankle]] that involves the [[lateral malleolus]] and the [[medial malleolus]]. Studies have shown&lt;ref name="tejwani"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tejwani|first=Nirmal|title=Are Outcomes of Bimalleolar Fractures Poorer Than Those of Lateral Malleolar Fractures with Medial Ligamentous Injury?|journal=Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery|year=2007|issue=89|pages=1438–1441|doi=10.2106/JBJS.F.01006|url=http://www.ejbjs.org/cgi/content/abstract/89/7/1438|accessdate=26 November 2010|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; that bimalleolar fractures are more common in women, people over 60 years of age, and patients with existing comorbidities.&lt;ref name="tejwani"/&gt;
==Cause==
{{Empty section|date=September 2017}}

==Diagnosis==
{{Empty section|date=September 2017}}

==Treatment ==

Surgical treatment will often be required, usually an [[Internal fixation|Open Reduction Internal Fixation]]. This involves the surgical [[Reduction (orthopedic surgery)|reduction]], or realignment, of the fracture followed by the implementation of surgical implants to aid in the healing of the fracture.&lt;ref name="verettas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verettas|first=D.A.|title=Talar body fracture combined with bimalleolar fracture|journal=Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery|date=July 2008|volume=128|issue=7|pages=731–734|pmid=17940778|doi=10.1007/s00402-007-0475-8|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Prognosis==
According to some studies, patients with bimalleolar fractures had significantly worse function in the ankle one year after [[Surgery|surgical]] treatment. After recovering fully from their fractures, the majority of patients experience little to mild pain and have few restrictions in functionality.&lt;ref name="tejwani"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55052">[[Image:Human Breastmilk - Foremilk and Hindmilk.png|thumb|400px|Two 25-milliliter samples of human breast milk. The lefthand sample is first milk produced and the righthand sample is milk produced later during the same pumping.]]
'''Breast milk''' is the [[milk]] produced by the [[breast]]s (or mammary glands) of a [[human]] female to feed a child. Milk is the primary source of nutrition for [[newborn]]s before they are able to eat and digest other foods; older infants and toddlers may continue to be [[breastfeeding|breastfed]],  in combination with other foods from six months of age when solid foods should be introduced.

==Methods==
The baby [[Breastfeeding|nursing]] from its own mother is the most common way of obtaining breast milk, but the milk can be [[breast pump|pumped]] and then fed by [[baby bottle]], cup and/or spoon, supplementation drip system, or [[nasogastric tube]]. In preterm children who do not have the ability to suck during their early days of life, avoiding bottles and tubes, and use of cups to feed expressed milk and other supplements is reported to result in better breastfeeding extent and duration subsequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Collins CT, Gillis J, McPhee AJ, Suganuma H, Makrides M | title = Avoidance of bottles during the establishment of breast feeds in preterm infants | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 10 | pages = CD005252 | date = October 2016 | pmid = 27756113 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005252.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Breast milk can be supplied by a woman other than the baby's mother, either via donated pumped milk (generally from a [[breastmilk donation|milk bank]] or via informal milk donation), or when a woman nurses a child other than her own at her breast, a practice known as [[wetnurse|wetnursing]].

The [[World Health Organization]] recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, with solids gradually being introduced around this age when signs of readiness are shown. Supplemented breastfeeding is recommended until at least age two and then for as long as the mother and child wish.&lt;ref name="who1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/exclusive_breastfeeding/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Exclusive breastfeeding |publisher=Who.int |date=2011-01-15 |access-date=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==

Breastfeeding offers health benefits to mother and child even after infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/infantfeeding_recommendation/en/

Breastfeeding also provides health benefits for the mother. It assists the uterus in returning to its pre-pregnancy size and reduces post-partum bleeding, as well as assisting the mother in returning to her pre-pregnancy weight.

Though it now is almost universally prescribed, in some countries in the 1950s the practice of [[breastfeeding]] went through a period where it was out of vogue and the use of [[infant formula]] was considered superior to breast milk. However, it is now universally recognized that there is no commercial formula that can equal breast milk.

[[File:Breastfeeding(milkfinal).png|frame|right|When the baby sucks its mother's breast, a hormone called oxytocin compels the milk to flow from the alveoli, through the ducts (milk canals) into the sacs (milk pools) behind the areola and then into the baby's mouth]]

Under the influence of the hormones [[prolactin]] and [[oxytocin]], women produce milk after [[childbirth]] to feed the [[baby]]. The initial milk produced is referred to as [[colostrum]], which is high in the [[immunoglobulin]] [[IgA]], which coats the [[gastrointestinal tract]]. This helps to protect the newborn until its own [[immune system]] is functioning properly. It also creates a mild laxative effect, expelling [[meconium]] and helping to prevent the build-up of [[bilirubin]] (a contributory factor in [[jaundice]]).

Actual inability to produce enough milk is rare, with studies showing that mothers from developing countries experiencing nutritional hardship still produce amounts of milk of similar quality to that of mothers in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;Prentice, A.M., Paul, A., Prentice, A., Black, A., Cole, T., &amp; Whitehead, R. (1986). Cross - cultural differences in lactational performance. In Maternal Environmental Factors in Human Lactation. Human Lactation 2, pp. 13 = 44 [Hamosh, M., &amp; Goldman, A.S. (eds). New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many reasons a mother may [[low milk supply|not produce enough breast milk]]. Some of the most common reasons are an improper latch (i.e., the baby does not connect efficiently with the nipple), not nursing or pumping enough to meet supply, certain medications (including estrogen-containing [[hormonal contraceptives]]), illness, and dehydration. A rarer reason is [[Sheehan's syndrome]], also known as postpartum [[hypopituitarism]], which is associated with prolactin deficiency and may require hormone replacement.

The amount of milk produced depends on how often the mother is nursing and/or [[breast pump|pumping]]: the more the mother nurses her baby or [[breast pump|pumps]], the more milk is produced.&lt;ref name="mayo1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/breast-feeding/FL00120 |title=Breast-feeding: Pumping and maintaining your milk supply |publisher=MayoClinic.com |date=2010-03-13 |access-date=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.llli.org/FAQ/increase.html |title=How Can I Increase My Milk Supply? |publisher=LLLI |date=2011-06-21 |access-date=2011-10-26 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parenting.ivillage.com/newborn/nbreastfeed/0,,456z,00.html |title=Breast milk: Increasing supply - iVillage |publisher=Parenting.ivillage.com |date=2010-01-01 |access-date=2011-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514140816/http://parenting.ivillage.com/newborn/nbreastfeed/0,,456z,00.html# |archive-date=2010-05-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babies.sutterhealth.org/breastfeeding/bf_production.html |title=How Breast Milk is Produced |publisher=Babies.sutterhealth.org |access-date=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is beneficial to nurse when the baby wants to nurse rather than on a schedule. A [[Cochrane review]] came to the conclusion that a greater volume of milk is expressed whilst listening to relaxing audio during breastfeeding, along with warming and massaging of the breast prior to and during feeding. A greater volume of milk expressed can also be attributed to instances where the mother starts pumping milk sooner, even if the infant is unable to breastfeed.&lt;ref name="BeckerSmith2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Becker GE, Smith HA, Cooney F | title = Methods of milk expression for lactating women | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 2 | pages = CD006170 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25722103 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006170.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sodium]] concentration is higher in hand-expressed milk, when compared with the use of manual and electric pumps, and fat content is higher when the breast has been massaged, in conjunction with listening to relaxing audio. This may be important for [[low birthweight]] infants.&lt;ref name="BeckerSmith2015"/&gt; If pumping, it is helpful to have an electric, high-grade pump so that all of the milk ducts are stimulated. [[Galactagogue]]s increase milk supply, although even herbal variants carry risks; therefore non-pharmaceutical methods should be tried first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kellymom.com/bf/can-i-breastfeed/herbs/fenugreek/

Breast milk contains complex proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and other biologically active components. The composition changes over a single feed as well as over the period of lactation.&lt;ref name="National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andreas NJ, Kampmann B, Mehring Le-Doare K | title = Human breast milk: A review on its composition and bioactivity | journal = Early Human Development | volume = 91 | issue = 11 | pages = 629–35 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26375355 | doi = 10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2015.08.013 | hdl = 10044/1/25981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Colostrum vs breastmilk.jpg|thumb|Colostrum vs breastmilk]]

During the first few days after delivery, the mother produces [[colostrum]]. This is a thin yellowish fluid that is the same fluid that sometimes leaks from the breasts during pregnancy. It is rich in protein and antibodies that provide passive immunity to the baby (the baby's immune system is not fully developed at birth). Colostrum also helps the newborn's digestive system to grow and function properly.

Colostrum will gradually change to become mature milk. In the first 3–4 days it will appear thin and watery and will taste very sweet; later, the milk will be thicker and creamier. Human milk quenches the baby's thirst and hunger and provides the proteins, sugar, minerals, and antibodies that the baby needs.

In the 1980s and 1990s, lactation professionals (De Cleats) used to make a differentiation between foremilk and hindmilk. But this differentiation causes confusion as there are not two types of milk. Instead, as a baby breastfeeds, the fat content very gradually increases, with the milk becoming fattier and fattier over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mohrbacher|first1=Nancy|title=Worries About Foremilk and Hindmilk|url=https://breastfeedingusa.org/content/article/worries-about-foremilk-and-hindmilk|website=Breastfeeding USA|access-date=1 March 2015|date=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human milk contains 0.8% to 0.9% protein, 4.5% fat, 7.1% carbohydrates, and 0.2% ash (minerals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Belitz H | title = Food Chemistry |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer |edition=4th |year=2009 |isbn=978-3-540-69935-4 |page=501 [table 10.5] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbohydrates are mainly [[lactose]]; several lactose-based oligosaccharides have been identified as minor components. The fat fraction contains specific [[triglycerides]] of [[palmitic acid|palmitic]] and [[oleic acid]] (O-P-O triglycerides), and also lipids with trans bonds (see: [[trans fat]]). The lipids are [[vaccenic acid]], and [[Conjugated linoleic acid]] (CLA) accounting for up to 6% of the human milk fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Precht D, Molkentin J | title = C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3 trans and cis fatty acid isomers including conjugated cis delta 9, trans delta 11 linoleic acid (CLA) as well as total fat composition of German human milk lipids | journal = Die Nahrung | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 233–44 | date = August 1999 | pmid = 10481820 | doi = 10.1002/(sici)1521-3803(19990801)43:4&lt;233::aid-food233&gt;3.3.co;2-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Friesen R, Innis SM | title = Trans fatty acids in human milk in Canada declined with the introduction of trans fat food labeling | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 136 | issue = 10 | pages = 2558–61 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16988126 | doi = 10.1093/jn/136.10.2558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal proteins are alpha-[[lactalbumin]], [[lactoferrin]] (apo-lactoferrin), [[IgA]], [[lysozyme]], and [[serum albumin]]. In an acidic environment such as the [[stomach]], alpha-lactalbumin [[protein folding|unfolds]] into a different form and binds [[oleic acid]] to form a complex called [[Experimental cancer treatment#HAMLET (human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells)|HAMLET]] that kills [[tumor]] cells.

Women [[breastfeeding]] should consult with their physician regarding substances that can be unwittingly passed to the infant via breast milk, such as [[alcohol]], viruses ([[HIV]] or [[HTLV-1]]) or medications. Even though most infants infected with HIV contract the disease from breastfeeding, most infants that are breastfed by their HIV positive mothers never contract the disease.&lt;ref name="Wahl_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wahl A, Baker C, Spagnuolo RA, Stamper LW, Fouda GG, Permar SR, Hinde K, Kuhn L, Bode L, Aldrovandi GM, Garcia JV | title = Breast Milk of HIV-Positive Mothers Has Potent and Species-Specific In Vivo HIV-Inhibitory Activity | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 89 | issue = 21 | pages = 10868–78 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26292320 | pmc = 4621099 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.01702-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While this paradoxical phenomenon suggests that the risk of HIV transmission between an HIV positive mother and her child via breastfeeding is small, studies have also shown that feeding infants with breast milk of HIV-positive mothers can actually have a preventative effect against HIV transmission between the mother and child.&lt;ref name="Wahl_2015" /&gt; This inhibitory effect against the infant contracting HIV is likely due to unspecified factors exclusively present in breast milk of HIV-positive mothers.&lt;ref name="Wahl_2015" /&gt;

Most women that do not breastfeed use [[infant formula]], but breast milk donated by volunteers to human milk banks can be obtained by prescription in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/breastfeeding/index.cfm?page=359 |title=Breastfeeding &amp;#124; Health benefits for mother and baby |publisher=womenshealth.gov |date=2010-08-01 |access-date=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, research has shown that women who rely on infant formula could minimize the gap between the level of immunity protection and cognitive abilities a breastfed child benefits from versus the degree to which a bottle-fed child benefits from them. This can be done by supplementing formula-fed infants with bovine milk fat globule membranes (MFGM) meant to mimic the positive effects of the MFGMs which are present in human breast milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hernell O, Timby N, Domellöf M, Lönnerdal B | title = Clinical Benefits of Milk Fat Globule Membranes for Infants and Children | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 173 Suppl | pages = S60–5 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27234413 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpeds.2016.02.077 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison to other milks ==
All [[mammal]]ian species produce milk, but the composition of milk for each species varies widely and other kinds of milk are often very different from human breast milk. As a rule, the milk of mammals that nurse frequently (including human babies) is less rich, or more watery, than the milk of mammals whose young nurse less often. Human milk is noticeably thinner and sweeter than cow's milk.

Whole cow's milk contains too little [[iron]], [[retinol]], [[vitamin E]], [[vitamin C]], [[vitamin D]], [[unsaturated fat]]s or essential [[fatty acid]]s for human babies.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Health, 1994.

== Alternative uses ==

In addition to providing essential nourishment to infants, human milk; i.e., breast milk, has a number of valuable uses, especially medicinal uses, for both children and adults. It has been used medicinally for thousands of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Nicki | last = Heskin | name-list-format = vanc | work = Bella Online | title = Medicinal Uses of Breast milk | url = http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art41924.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breast milk contains strong [[antibodies]] and [[antitoxin]]s that many people believe promote healing and better overall health. However, breast milk lacks sterile and antiseptic properties if a nursing mother is infected with certain [[communicable disease]]s, such as [[HIV]] and CMV, as breast milk can transmit such diseases to infants and other people.&lt;ref name="pmid6245360"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stagno S, Reynolds DW, Pass RF, Alford CA | title = Breast milk and the risk of cytomegalovirus infection | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 302 | issue = 19 | pages = 1073–6 | date = May 1980 | pmid = 6245360 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM198005083021908 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mabuka J, Nduati R, Odem-Davis K, Peterson D, Overbaugh J | title = HIV-specific antibodies capable of ADCC are common in breastmilk and are associated with reduced risk of transmission in women with high viral loads | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1002739 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22719248 | pmc = 3375288 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002739 | editor1-last = Desrosiers | editor1-first = Ronald C | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breast milk has been used as a [[home remedy]] for minor [[ailment]]s, such as [[conjunctivitis]], [[insect bites and stings]], [[contact dermatitis]], and infected [[wounds]], [[burn]]s, and [[abrasion (medical)|abrasion]]s. Breast milk has also been used [[alternative medicine|alternatively]] to boost the [[immune system]] of ill persons having [[viral gastroenteritis]], [[influenza]], the [[common cold]], [[pneumonia]], etc., because of its [[immunologic]] properties. However, breast milk should never be seen or construed as a "[[panacea (medicine)|cure-all]]". Some medical experts are convinced that breast milk can induce [[apoptosis]] in some types of [[cancer cells]]. However, more research and evidence are needed in this area of cancer treatment.&lt;ref name="Hallgren O, Aits S, Brest P, Gustafsson L, Mossberg AK, Wullt B, Svanborg C 2008 217–40"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Hallgren O, Aits S, Brest P, Gustafsson L, Mossberg AK, Wullt B, Svanborg C | title = Apoptosis and tumor cell death in response to HAMLET (human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells) | volume = 606 | pages = 217–40 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18183931 | doi = 10.1007/978-0-387-74087-4_8 | isbn = 978-0-387-74086-7 | series = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A minority of people, including restaurateurs Hans Lochen of [[Switzerland]] and Daniel Angerer of [[Austria]], who operates a restaurant in New York City, have used human breast milk, or at least advocated its use, as a substitute for cow's milk in [[dairy]] products and food [[recipe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = New York Daily News | title = Restaurant Drops Plan to Cook with Breast Milk | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2008/09/18/2008-09-18_restaurant_drops_plan_to_cook_with_breas.html | first = Rosemary | last = Black | name-list-format = vanc | date = 18 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tammy Frissell-Deppe, a family counsellor specialized in [[attachment parenting]], published a book, titled ''A Breastfeeding Mother's Secret Recipes'', providing a lengthy compilation of detailed food and beverage recipes containing human breast milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Tammy | last = Frissell-Deppe | name-list-format = vanc | title = A Breastfeeding Mother's Secret Recipes: Breast milk Recipes, Fun Food for Kids and Quick Dishes! | location = Dracut, MA | publisher = JED Publishing | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[animal rights]] organization known as [[PETA]] ignited a firestorm of criticism when it urged a dairy company to replace the cow's milk they use in their ice cream products with human breast milk as a way to stop cattle abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = PETA.org | title = The Breast Is Best!

Attempts to formulate [[soap]] from breast milk have also been made, and those using it claim that its effectiveness as a [[cleanser]] is greater than, or equal to, that of traditional soaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = The Traditional Midwife | title = Mother's Milk Soap | url = http://traditionalmidwife.com/mothersmilksoap.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pesticides and other toxic substances [[bioaccumulate]]; i.e., creatures higher up the [[food chain]] will store more of them in their [[body fat]]. This is an issue in particular for the [[Inuit]], whose [[Inuit diet|traditional diet]] is predominantly meat. Studies are looking at the effects of [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] and [[persistent organic pollutants]] in the body; the breast milk of Inuit mothers is extraordinarily high in toxic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;''Silent Snow: The Slow Poisoning of the Arctic'' by Marla Cone, Grove Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

An Icecreamist in London's Covent Garden started selling an ice cream named Baby Gaga in February 2011. Each serving costs £14. All the milk was donated by a Mrs Hiley who earns £15 for every 10 ounces and calls it a "great recession beater".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-12569011 | work=BBC News | location=London | title=Breast milk ice cream goes on sale in Covent Garden. | date=2011-02-24 | access-date=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ice cream sold out on its first day.

While there is no scientific evidence that shows that breast milk is more advantageous for adults than cow's milk, according to several 2015 news sources breast milk is being used by [[bodybuilders]] for its nutritional value. In a February 2015 [[ABC News]] article one former competitive body builder said, "It isn’t common, but I’ve known people who have done this. It’s certainly talked about quite a bit on the bodybuilding forums on the Internet." Calling bodybuilders "a strange breed of individuals,” he said, “Even if this type of thing is completely unsupported by research, they’re prone to gym lore and willing to give it a shot if there is any potential effect.” At the time the article was written, in the U.S. the price of breast milk procured from milk banks that pasteurize the milk, and have expensive quality and safety controls, was about $10 an ounce, and the price in the alternative market online, bought directly from mothers, ranges from $1 to $4 per US fluid ounce, compared to cow's milk at about $3.44 a gallon.&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/body-builders-pounding-breast-milk/story?id=29020910 | title=Why Bodybuilders Are Pounding Down Breast Milk | publisher=ABC News | date=17 February 2015 | access-date=4 December 2015 | last = Neporent | first = Liz | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.menshealth.com/fitness/human-breast-milk-and-bodybuilding | title=Bodybuilders Are Drinking Human Breast Milk.

== Market ==
{{main|human milk bank}}
There is a [[Market (economics)|market]] for human breast milk, both in the form of [[wet nurse]] service and milk product. As a product, breast milk is exchanged by [[human milk bank]]s as well as directly between milk donors and customers mediated by websites on the Internet. Human milk banks generally have standardized measures for screening donors and storing the milk, while donors on websites vary in regard to these measures. A study in 2013 came to the conclusion that 74% of breast milk samples from providers found from websites were colonized with [[Gram-negative bacteria]] or had more than 10,000 [[colony-forming unit]]s/mL of [[aerobic bacteria]].&lt;ref name=Keim2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keim SA, Hogan JS, McNamara KA, Gudimetla V, Dillon CE, Kwiek JJ, Geraghty SR | title = Microbial contamination of human milk purchased via the Internet | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 132 | issue = 5 | pages = e1227–35 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24144714 | pmc = 4530303 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2013-1687 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth happens during transit.&lt;ref name=Keim2013/&gt; According to the FDA, the bacteria in fresh milk doubles every 20 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Refrigerator Thermometers: Cold Facts about Food Safety | url = https://www.fda.gov/food/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm253954.htm | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration }}&lt;/ref&gt; Breast milk is considered to be healthier than cow's milk and infant formula when it comes to feeding an infant in the first 6 months of life, but only under extreme situations do international health organizations support feeding an infant breast milk from a healthy wet nurse rather than that of its biological mother.&lt;ref name="Geraghty_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Geraghty SR, Heier JE, Rasmussen KM | title = Got milk?

'''The Children's Tumor Foundation''' (CTF) is a [[501(c)3|501(c)(3]]) foundation dedicated to improving the health and well-being of individuals and families affected by [[neurofibromatosis]] (NF). Their four-part mission includes propelling drug research and development through a series of strategic investments, strengthening patient support, increasing public awareness of NF and establishing [[best practices]] in clinical care for affected individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Foundation|url=http://www.ctf.org/About-the-Foundation/Mission-Statement.html|website=The Children's Tumor Foundation|publisher=Children's Tumor Foundation|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation is incorporated in all 50 states with active chapters and affiliates in 37 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Relations|url=http://www.ctf.org/Community-Relations/Community-Relations-Homepage.html|publisher=Children's Tumor Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; CTF is the largest private funder of NF research.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jessen|first1=Walter|title=The 2010 NF Conference: Connecting the Public With the Research|url=http://www.highlighthealth.com/cancer/the-2010-nf-conference-connecting-the-public-with-the-research/|website=www.highlighthealth.com/cancer/the-2010-nf-conference-connecting-the-public-with-the-research/|publisher=Highlight HEALTH|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Established in 1978 as the National Neurofibromatosis Foundation by Lynne Ann Courtemanche, RN, neurologist Allen E. Rubenstein, MD and Joel S. Hirschtritt, Esq., the organization changed its name to Children’s Tumor Foundation in 2005.  In the early years, the organization’s focus was on providing patient support and organizing the NF community.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bettermann|first1=Peter|title=The National Neurofibromatosis Foundation|date=2005|publisher=The Children's Tumor Foundation|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, their aim incorporated discovering the genes that cause NF. CTF began concentrating on [[translational research]] in 2005; in 2008 CTF also began to fund [[clinical trials]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Innovator Spotlight: Q&amp;A with John Risner|url=http://train.fastercures.org/CCC/spot_ctf.html|website=TRAIN Central Station|publisher=FasterCures|accessdate=12 October 2014|date = March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of President and Chief Scientific Officer Annette Bakker, the organization has shifted from a more traditional funding model to a funder-partner model in order to accelerate the [[drug discovery]] process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Notable achievements ==
The Foundation awarded its first grants in 1988, launching the first neurofibromatosis research program in the world. In 1985, they organized the NF Conference, the first major gathering of NF scientists and clinicians.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Foundation: Milestones|url=http://www.ctf.org/About-the-Foundation/Milestones.html|website=ctf.org|publisher=Children's Tumor Foundation|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 and 1993, respectively, labs funded by grants from the Foundation identified the genes for NF1 and NF2.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 1997, CTF launched an international summer camp for youth affected by NF. In 2006, the Foundation began funding a [[drug discovery]] initiative and piloted a program for a network of NF clinics. They launched a [[patient registry]] in 2012 and a specimen [[biobank]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bioworld.com/content/%E2%80%98gate%E2%80%99-foundation-enter-here-early-de-risking-and-add-indications|title = 'Gate' Foundation? Enter Here for Early De-Risking and Add-On Indications|date = 3 April 2014|accessdate = 15 September 2014|website = BioWorld|publisher = Thomson Reuters|last = Osborne|first = Randy|registration = Yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Foundation established Synodos for NF2, a first-of-its kind collaboration of NF scientists working across institutions to find a cure for NF2. A similar project, Synodos for NF1, is planned to begin in 2015.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Funding model ==
In recent years, CTF has shifted its funding model from that of a more traditional non-profit organization to one more aligned with the [[venture capital]] approach advocated by the [[Milken Institute|Milken Institute’s]] [[FasterCures]] model. CTF now situates itself as a catalyst of NF research and has created active partnerships with patients, scientists, [[research institutions]] and both the [[biotechnology]] and [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] industries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Major initiatives and key investments ==
* '''The Young Investigator's Award''' (YIA): Begun in 1985, this two-year award is granted to post-doctoral and early-career scientists. It is intended to establish awardees as independent investigators. Many former awardees have become leaders in the field of NF research and within the clinical community.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* '''Drug Discovery Initiative''' (DDI): Begun in 2006, this award facilitates [[Preclinical development|preclinical]] screenings to develop data of both ''[[in vitro]]'' and ''[[in vivo]]'' screening of NF therapeutics.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* '''Children’s Tumor Foundation NF Clinic Network: '''CTF established the NF Clinic Network in 2007. This network currently includes 47 affiliate clinics throughout the United States, all of which adhere to current consensus clinical care guidelines for NF. Over 10,000 patients with NF are treated at these clinics annually.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* '''NF Conference''': In 1985, CTF convened the first-ever scientific meeting focusing on neurofibromatosis with the goal of encouraging research and fostering collaboration in the scientific community. Held annually, it is now considered the preeminent meeting of NF scientists and clinicians worldwide.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* '''NF Forum''': In response to continued layperson interest in the proceedings of the NF Conference, CTF initiated the NF Forum. Held annually, the Forum is attended by those affected by NF and their families as well as scientists and advocates in the NF field. It is held contingent to the NF conference on a biannual basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ctf.org/NF-Forum/NF-Forum-2013.html|title = CTF.org|date = |accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = Children's Tumor Foundation|last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141229013933/http://www.ctf.org/NF-Forum/NF-Forum-2013.html|archivedate = 29 December 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''NF Preclinical Drug Screening Consortium''' (NFPC): The NFPC was a $4M, 4-year multi-site preclinical drug screening consortium designed to accelerate identification of candidate drug therapies and speed their progress to the clinic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Consortium''' (NFTC): Launched in 2013, this collaboration with the NF Therapeutics Acceleration Program at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] is a three-year program that continues preclinical testing using animal models established during the NF Preclinical Drug Screening Consortium.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Patient Registry''': The registry’s intended primary outcome is “to speed the development of promising new treatments.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://nfregistry.patientcrossroads.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=427&amp;Itemid=513&amp;lang=en|title = Patient Crossroads|date = |accessdate = 1 January 2015|website = FAQ's|publisher = Patient Crossroads|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as a referral source for clinical trials and provides registered patients with up-to-date, personalized information about their particular manifestation(s) of NF.  It currently has over 5000 registrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://nfregistry.patientcrossroads.org/|title = Patient Crossroads|date = |accessdate = 1 January 2015|website = NF Registry|publisher = Patient Crossroads|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Synodos for NF2''': Launched in 2014, Synodos for NF2 is [[consortium]] of scientists from a variety of institutions who have agreed to collaborate, sharing data in real time and working together to find treatments for NF2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.genomeweb.com/synodos-initiative-formed-battle-neurofibromatosis|title = GenomeWeb|date = 10 March 2014|accessdate = 20 October 2014|website = Synodos Initiative Formed to Battle Neurofibromatosis|publisher = GenomeWeb|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Synodos for NF1''': Announced in 2014 and launching in early 2015, Synodos for NF1 is a consortium of scientists from a variety of institutions who have agreed to collaborate, sharing data in real time and working together to find treatments for NF1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ctf.org/Research/Synodos-for-NF1.html|title = Children's Tumor Foundation|date = |accessdate = 1 January 2015|website = Synodos for NF1: Call for Applicants|publisher = Children's Tumor Foundation|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Patient support ==
The Foundation publishes educational brochures for patients, their caregivers and other interested parties on a variety of subjects. Many of these brochures are available in both English and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ctf.org/Patient-Information/Patient-Information-Brochures.html|title = CTF.org|date = |accessdate = 4 January 2014|website = Information Brochures|publisher = Children's Tumor Foundation|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation in the NF Registry offers additional support to patients and their families. In addition to providing up-to-date information about applicable clinical trials, the registry allows patients and their families the opportunity to receive information targeted to their specific NF-related symptoms. In addition to these efforts, The Foundation also sponsors an annual summer camp for youth living with NF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ctf.org/Learn-About-NF/NF-Camp.html|title = CTF.org|date = |accessdate = 4 January 2015|website = NF Camp|publisher = Children's Tumor Foundation|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy ==
CTF advocates on a national level for funding of neurofibromatosis research. The Foundation is considered instrumental in securing both initial and ongoing funding through the Department of Defense Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program Neurofibromatosis Research Program (CDMRP-NFRP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations for 2003: Department of Labor|last = |first = |publisher = US Government Printing Office|year = 2002|isbn = |location = United States|pages = 1243, 1247}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of their efforts, CTF organizes volunteers to petition their representatives in Congress and the Senate online, by letter and in person, to urge continued and increased funding through both the CDMPR-NFRP and the [[National Institutes of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ctf.org/How-You-Can-Help/Advocacy.html|title = How You Can Help: Advocacy|date = |accessdate = November 11, 2014|website = Advocacy:  How You Can Help|publisher = Children's Tumor Foundation|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundraising programs ==
The Foundation sponsors a number of programs designed to raise money and bolster NF awareness, as well as provide a sense of community for those who live with NF. These programs include Racing4Research, NF Endurance, NF Walk and Cupid’s Undie Run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ctf.org/How-You-Can-Help/|title = CTF.org|date = |accessdate = 15 October 2014|website = How You Can Help|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2697">In [[multivariate statistics]], the '''congruence coefficient''' is an index of the similarity between factors that have been derived in a [[factor analysis]]. It was introduced in 1948 by [[Cyril Burt]] who referred to it as ''unadjusted correlation''. It is also called ''Tucker's congruence coefficient'' after [[Ledyard Tucker]] who popularized the technique. Its values range between -1 and +1. It can be used to study the similarity of extracted factors across different samples of, for example, test takers who have taken the same test.&lt;ref name="lorenzo"&gt;Lorenzo-Seva, U. &amp; ten Berge, J.M.F. (2006). Tucker’s Congruence Coefficient as a Meaningful Index of Factor Similarity. ''Methodology, 2,'' 57–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jensen"&gt;Jensen, A.R. (1998). ''The ''g'' factor: The science of mental ability''. Westport, CT: Praeger, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="herve"&gt;Abdi, H. (2007). [http://wwwpub.utdallas.edu/~herve/Abdi-RV2007-pretty.pdf RV Coefficient and Congruence Coefficient.] In Neil Salkind (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Measurement and Statistics.'' Thousand Oaks (CA): Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[column vector]]s of factor loadings for two different samples. The formula for the congruence coefficient, or ''r&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'', is then&lt;ref name="jensen"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r_c=
\frac{
\sum{XY}}
\sqrt{\sum{X^2}\sum{Y^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Interpretation==

Generally, a congruence coefficient of 0.90 is interpreted as indicating a high degree of factor similarity, while a coefficient of 0.95 or higher indicates that the factors are virtually identical. Alternatively, a value in the range 0.85–0.94 has been seen as corresponding to a fair similarity, with values higher than 0.95 indicating that the factors can be considered to be equal.&lt;ref name="lorenzo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jensen"/&gt;

The congruence coefficient can also be defined as the [[cosine]] of the angle between factor axes based on the same set of variables (e.g., tests) obtained for two samples (see [[Cosine similarity]]). For example, with perfect congruence the angle between the factor axes is 0 degrees, and the cosine of 0 is 1.&lt;ref name="jensen"/&gt;

==Comparison with Pearson's ''r''==

The congruence coefficient is preferred to [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson's ''r'']] as a measure of factor similarity, because the latter may produce misleading results. The computation of the congruence coefficient is based on the deviations of factor loadings from zero, whereas ''r'' is based on the deviations from the mean of the factor loadings.&lt;ref name="jensen"/&gt;

[[Malay titles#Datuk Sri|Datuk Seri]] [[Doctor of Philosophy|Dr.]] [[Hajji|Haji]] '''Dzulkefly bin Ahmad''' ([[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: ذلكفلي بن احمد; born 1 January 1956) is a [[Malaysian people|Malaysian]] politician and serves in the Cabinet of Malaysia as the [[Ministry of Health (Malaysia)|Minister of Health]] since 21 May 2018. He is currently the Member of the [[Parliament of Malaysia]] for [[Kuala Selangor]] for the second time since 2018. He presently is a member of the [[Parti Amanah Negara]] (Amanah), a component party in [[Pakatan Harapan]] (PH) coalition.

Dzulkefly previously held the same parliamentary seat of Kuala Selangor for the first time from 2008 until 2013 but under [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party]] (PAS).

==Early life==
Dzulkefly holds a bachelor's degree from the [[University of Birmingham]] and a master's degree from the [[University of Surrey]]. He later completed his doctorate in [[toxicology]] from the [[Imperial College]] (St. Mary's Hospital Medical School) in 1993.&lt;ref name="bdig"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BjCV5nPlSHL/|title=Bernama Radio on Instagram: “Infografik: Profil Menteri Kesihatan #BernamaRadio #semuanyatentanganda #pakatanharapan”|website=[[Instagram]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Dzulkefly made his debut in the [[Malaysian general election, 2004|2004 election]], contesting the [[Rembau (federal constituency)|Rembau]] parliamentary seat in Negeri Sembilan for PAS  but lost. He was elected to Parliament in the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 election]], winning the seat of Kuala Selangor, which had been held by the ruling [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) coalition.&lt;ref name="2008 election results"&gt;{{Cite web

The Herald|decision of the Malaysian High Court]] to allow a Catholic publication to use the term "Allah".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/48263-khir-toyo-says-in-mourning-over-allah-ruling|title=Khir Toyo says in mourning over Allah ruling|last=Mustafa Kamal|first=Shazwan|date=1 January 2010|publisher=The Malaysian Insider|accessdate=11 January 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105020716/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/48263-khir-toyo-says-in-mourning-over-allah-ruling|archivedate=5 January 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dzulkefly was a prominent member of the moderate, or "Erdogan" (after the [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan|Turkish politician]]), faction of PAS. He lost his parliamentary seat in the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|2013 election]], tallying 460 votes fewer than the [[Barisan Nasional]] candidate [[Irmohizam Ibrahim]].&lt;ref name="2008 election results"/&gt; Despite the loss, he was re-elected to the party's central committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/searealtime/2013/11/24/moderates-hold-sway-in-malaysias-islamic-party-poll/|title=Moderates Hold Sway In Malaysia’s Islamic Party Poll|last=Ganghopadhyay|first=Abhrajit|date=24 November 2013|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected again in the [[Malaysian general election, 2018|2018 election]] as an AMANAH candidate.

[[Madagascar]] is among very few countries in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] with an opportunity to slow the [[human immunodeficiency virus]] epidemic and avert the socioeconomic destruction that is evident in high-prevalence areas. With the internal and external migration of workforce to keep up with the labor needs of these economic zones, Madagascar will be faced with an increased problem containing HIV, which would have a negative effect on the economic and development efforts. If these problems are not proactively addressed, Madagascar could actually reverse the benefits brought to the country through the period of economic prosperity and increase its health and social burden.&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/global_health/aids/Countries/africa/madagascar_05.pdf "Health Profile: Madagascar"].

Even though low, the HIV prevalence in Madagascar is increasing, as seen among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics; prevalence in this population rose from 0.064% in 1995 to 1.1% in 2003. Madagascar's rapid increase in HIV prevalence is likely influenced by a variety of conditions, including low literacy, widespread poverty, limited access to health and social services, high rates of partner change, and an increasingly transient population. Madagascar also has some of the highest rates of [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs) in the world. Services for prevention and treatment of HIV, such as counseling and testing and antiretroviral therapy, are being offered, but only a small portion of the [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] in need currently benefit from these interventions. At the end of 2003, Madagascar had only 13 sites offering counseling and testing services to 2,082 clients annually. Treatment for HIV is still limited in Madagascar, with only one site in the country currently offering antiretroviral therapy at the end of 2003. As of September 2004, only 30 of an estimated 17,000 adults in need of treatment for advanced HIV were receiving antiretroviral therapy.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

==National response==
Efforts by the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) and other donors to garner the commitment of the [[Government of Madagascar]] to HIV prevention and treatment have paid off. One of the primary supports to addressing Madagascar's emerging epidemic is the powerful political commitment at the highest levels of the new government. Just after his inauguration in 2002, President [[Marc Ravalomanana]] publicly established his leadership in HIV prevention. He chairs the nation's multisectoral HIV/AIDS program [Conseil National de Lutte contre le SIDA (CNLS)]. President Ravalomanana is committed to aggressively fighting the spread of HIV, and the government has taken bold steps to control the spread of the infection. The National Strategic Framework was approved by the government in December 2001 and was adjusted following the first national seroprevalence survey in 2003. The country's overall strategy focuses on behavior change and prevention, treatment of HIV and STIs, and AIDS education.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

With the guidance of USAID and other partners, the Government of Madagascar is actively responding to gaps in its HIV/AIDS program. The government will use $13.4 million from [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] to expand current interventions by opening 40 new counseling and testing sites in 2005 and will reinforce existing HIV-prevention measures by ensuring use of universal precaution measures, reinforcing blood transfusion safety, and providing free condoms in public health care facilities. New interventions will include measures to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission in 11 districts and the provision of psychosocial and community medical care for about 500 to 750 persons living with HIV/AIDS. The program will also lay the groundwork for the care of the estimated 30,000 children orphaned by AIDS.&lt;ref name=usaid/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=July 2007}}

'''Healing''' is the process of the restoration of [[health]] from an unbalanced, diseased or damaged organism. The result of healing can be a cure to a health challenge, but one can heal without being cured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.samueliinstitute.org/File%20Library/About%20Us/Samueli-Institute-Strategic-Plan.pdf|title=Building the Science of Healing|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The profession of nursing has been traditionally concerned with matters of healing, whereas historically the profession of medicine has been concerned with curing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McElligott|first=D|date=2010|title=Healing: The journey from concept to nursing practice|journal=Journal of Holistic Nursing|volume=28 | issue = 4 |pages=251–9|via=|pmid=20660908|doi=10.1177/0898010110376321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With physical damage or disease suffered by an organism, healing involves the repair of living [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] and the [[biological system]] as a whole and resumption of normal functioning. It is the process by which the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the [[Human body|body]] regenerate and repair to reduce the size of a damaged or [[necrosis|necrotic]] area and replace it with new living tissue. The replacement can happen in two ways: by ''regeneration'' in which the necrotic cells are replaced by new cells that form similar tissue as was originally there; or by ''repair'' in which injured tissue is replaced with [[scar|scar tissue]]. Most [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] will heal using a mixture of both mechanisms.

It is also referred to in the context of the grieving process.

In [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]], healing is the process by which [[neuroses]] and [[psychoses]] are resolved to the degree that the client is able to lead a normal or fulfilling existence without being overwhelmed by [[Psychopathology|psychopathological]] phenomena. This process may involve [[psychotherapy]], [[pharmaceutical]] treatment or [[alternative medicine|alternative]] approaches such as [[Holistic health|traditional spiritual healing]].

==Regeneration==
In order for an [[injury]] to be healed by regeneration, the cell type that was destroyed must be able to replicate. Cells also need a [[collagen]] framework along which to grow. Alongside most cells there is either a [[basement membrane]] or a [[extracellular matrix|collagenous network]] made by [[fibroblast]]s that will guide the cells' growth.  Since [[ischaemia]] and most [[toxin]]s do not destroy collagen, it will continue to exist even when the cells around it are dead.

===Example===
[[Acute tubular necrosis]] (ATN) in the [[kidney]] is a case in which cells heal completely by regeneration. ATN occurs when the [[epithelial cell]]s that line the kidney are destroyed by either a lack of [[oxygen]] (such as in [[hypovolemic shock]], when blood supply to the kidneys is dramatically reduced), or by toxins (such as some [[antibiotic]]s, [[heavy metals]] or [[carbon tetrachloride]]).

Although many of these epithelial cells are dead, there is typically patchy necrosis, meaning that there are patches of epithelial cells still alive. In addition, the collagen framework of the tubules remains completely intact.

The existing epithelial cells can replicate, and, using the basement membrane as a guide, eventually bring the kidney back to normal. After regeneration is complete, the damage is undetectable, even [[Microscope|microscopically]].

Healing must happen by repair in the case of injury to cells that are unable to regenerate (e.g. neurons). Also, damage to the collagen network (e.g. by [[enzyme]]s or physical destruction), or its total collapse (as can happen in an [[infarct]]) cause healing to take place by repair.

==Genetics==
Many genes play a role in healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=21719 | pmid=9751744 | volume=95 | title=Genetic analysis of a mammalian wound-healing trait | author=McBrearty BA, Clark LD, Zhang XM, Blankenhorn EP, Heber-Katz E | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | pages=11792–7 | doi=10.1073/pnas.95.20.11792}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in wound healing, P21 has been found to allow mammals to heal spontaneously. It even allows some mammals (like mice) to heal wounds without scars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/mar/15/mice-genetics-p21-heal-no-scar Genetic discovery promises healing without scars]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/107/13/5845.abstract Lack of p21 expression links cell cycle control and appendage regeneration in mice]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[LIN28]] gene also plays a role in wound healing. It is dormant in most mammals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-limb-regeneration-ins/ New Limb Regeneration Insight Surprises Scientists]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the proteins [[MG53]] and [[TGF beta 1]] play important roles in wound healing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160302135149.htm Gene identified that helps wound healing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wound healing==
{{main | Wound healing}}

In response to an incision or wound, a [[Wound healing|wound healing cascade]] is unleashed.  This cascade takes place in four phases: clot formation, inflammation, proliferation, and maturation.

===Clotting phase===
Healing of a wound begins with [[clot]] formation to stop bleeding and to reduce infection by bacteria, [[virus]]es and [[fungi]]. Clotting is followed by [[neutrophil]] invasion three to 24 hours after the wound has been incurred, with [[mitosis|mitoses]] beginning in [[epithelium|epithelial]] cells after 24 to 48 hours .{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Inflammation phase===
In the inflammatory phase, [[macrophage]]s and other [[phagocytosis|phagocytic]] cells kill bacteria, debride damaged tissue and release chemical factors such as [[growth hormone]]s that encourage fibroblasts, [[epithelial cell]]s and endothelial cells which make new [[capillary|capillaries]] to migrate to the area and divide.

===Proliferative phase===
In the proliferative phase, immature [[granulation tissue]] containing plump, active fibroblasts forms. Fibroblasts quickly produce abundant type III [[collagen]], which fills the defect left by an open wound. Granulation tissue moves, as a wave, from the border of the injury towards the center.

As granulation tissue matures, the fibroblasts produce less collagen and become more spindly in appearance. They begin to produce the much stronger type I collagen. Some of the fibroblasts mature into myofibroblasts which contain the same type of [[actin]] found in [[smooth muscle]], which enables them to contract and reduce the size of the wound.

===Maturation phase===
During the maturation phase of wound healing, unnecessary vessels formed in granulation tissue are removed by [[apoptosis]], and type III collagen is largely replaced by type I. Collagen which was originally disorganized is cross-linked and aligned along tension lines. This phase can last a year or longer. Ultimately a scar made of collagen, containing a small number of fibroblasts is left.

== Tissue damaged by inflammation ==
After inflammation has damaged tissue (when combatting bacterial infection for example) and pro-inflammatory [[eicosanoid]]s have completed their function, healing proceeds in 4 phases.&lt;ref&gt;''The Anti-Inflammation Zone'', Barry Sears, pages 230-233, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recall phase===
In the recall phase the [[adrenal gland]]s increase production of [[cortisol]] which shuts down eicosanoid production and inflammation.

===Resolution phase===
In the Resolution phase, pathogens and damaged tissue are removed by [[macrophage]]s (white blood cells). Red blood cells are also removed from the damaged tissue by macrophages. Failure to remove all of the damaged cells and pathogens may retrigger inflammation. The two subsets of macrophage M1 &amp; M2 plays a crucial role in this phase, M1 macrophage being a pro inflammatory while as M2 is a regenerative and the plasticity between the two subsets determine the tissue inflammation or repair.

===Regeneration phase===
In the Regeneration phase, blood vessels are repaired and new cells form in the damaged site similar to the cells that were damaged and removed.  Some cells such as neurons and muscle cells (especially in the heart) are slow to recover.

===Repair phase===
In the Repair phase, new tissue is generated which requires a balance of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids.  Anti-inflammatory eicosanoids include [[lipoxin]]s, [[epi-lipoxin]]s, and [[resolvin]]s, which cause release of growth hormones.

'''HealthRight International''' is a global health and human rights organization. HealthRight was founded in 1990 by physician and human rights advocate Dr. [[Jonathan Mann (WHO official)|Jonathan Mann]]. 

HealthRight International was known as Doctors of the World-USA from its founding in 1990 until it adopted its new name in 2009, and from 1990 to 2009 was the U.S. delegation to the Medecins du Monde International Network. In 2011, a new Medecins du Monde organization was registered in the United States as Doctors of the World USA.  This new Doctors of the World is not in any way related to HealthRight or the works and projects HealthRight performed as Doctors of the World-USA from 1990-2009.


Headquartered in New York, HealthRight has worked in over 30 countries, with current projects in [[Kenya]], [[Mexico]], [[Nepal]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[United States]], and [[Vietnam]].

==Priorities &amp; Projects==

HealthRight projects combine direct service, systems strengthening, and advocacy. Its projects are sustained and grown under local conditions and then transferred to local ownership. Projects address health and social crises made worse by human rights violations, with a particular focus and expertise on:

* [[HIV/AIDS]], [[tuberculosis|TB]], and [[malaria]], including the rights of people with these diseases to care and protection from stigma and discrimination
* [[Women's health]], including women's right to safe and effective maternal and neonatal care, as well as information and equal access to protection and quality health services
* The health and welfare of orphans and other at risk children and youth, whose well-being may be endangered when they lack supportive families or social networks
* Care and support for survivors of human rights violations such as [[torture]], [[human trafficking]], and gender-based violence

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1667">The '''Health Insurance Organisation''' is a state agency which runs the healthcare system in [[Cyprus]].  It administers the funds which pays for the [[Gesy]] system.

It negotiates with the [[Cyprus Medical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Health Minister calls foul on medical association for not playing ball on Gesy |url=https://cyprus-mail.com/2018/04/02/health-minister-calls-foul-medical-association-not-playing-ball-gesy/ |accessdate=11 September 2018 |publisher=Cyprus Mail |date=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was criticised by the official audit in 2018 which said that “Execution of important projects that are necessary for the implementation of the Gesy like reorganization/autonomy of state hospitals, which should have been handled as a matter of priority have been greatly delayed.”  No criteria were in place for selecting overseas centres to which patients would be sent for treatments not available on the island. Most patients were sent to UK, Germany, Greece, and Israel but the financial arrangements were unsatisfactory. In 2016  276 patients were sent to Germany at a cost of about €5.2 million, and 426 to Greece at a cost of about €3 million. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Health ministry ‘measures to boost staffing’ focused on satisfying demands of doctors and nurses, audit shows |url=https://cyprus-mail.com/2018/08/20/health-ministry-measures-to-boost-staffing-focused-on-satisfying-demands-of-doctors-and-nurses-audit-shows/ |accessdate=11 September 2018 |publisher=Cyprus Mail |date=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Health in Syria''', although emphasized by the country's ruling [[Baath Party]] and improving significantly in recent years, has been declining due to the ongoing [[Syrian Civil War|civil war]] which saw the destruction of many hospitals nationwide, and the deterioration in the functionality of some medical equipment due to the lack of spare parts and maintenance shortages of drugs and medical supplies due to sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Health care in Syria before and during the crisis | pmc=3697421 | pmid=23826546 | doi=10.4103/2231-0770.102275 | volume=2 | year=2012 | journal=Avicenna J Med | pages=51–53 | last1 = Kherallah | first1 = M | last2 = Alahfez | first2 = T | last3 = Sahloul | first3 = Z | last4 = Eddin | first4 = KD | last5 = Jamil | first5 = G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whatsoever, healthcare has been improving in government-held areas with many public and private hospitals still functioning.

Health expenditures reportedly accounted for 3.3 percent of the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 2014.&lt;ref name="worldfactbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sy.html |title=The World Factbook |publisher= CIA | accessdate= 23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Syria's population was an estimated 18,028,549.&lt;ref name="worldfactbook"/&gt; In 2017, the average life expectancy for Syrians is 75 years, 72 for males and 77 for females,&lt;ref name="worldfactbook"/&gt; compared to the average life expectancy in 1960, which was 52 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN|title=Life expectancy at birth, total (years)|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate= 23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total dependency ratio was 72.8 in 2015,&lt;ref name="worldfactbook"/&gt; while the [[median age]] was 24 in 2017.&lt;ref name="worldfactbook"/&gt;

Key health indicators in Syria show that infectious diseases and illnesses related to environmental pollution remain serious problems. The rate of prevalence of [[HIV]]/AIDS in 2001 was 0.01 percent.

=== Obesity ===
In 2017, the adult prevalence rate for obesity was 27.8, and in 2009 10% of children under 5 were obese.&lt;ref name="worldfactbook"/&gt; In 2016, Syria ranked 35 in the list of countries by body mass index, according to the World Health Organisation data on Prevalence of Obesity, published in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Topics, Obesity|url=http://www.who.int/topics/obesity/en/|publisher=World Health Organisation|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sanitation ===
In 2015, 95.7% of the population had access to sanitation and 90.1% of the population had access to clean water.&lt;ref name="worldfactbook"/&gt; Although water pollution poses a threat to the availability of clean water and sanitation, as analyses of water samples for ammonia, suspended solids and BOD in Aleppo's Quweiq River and the lower part of the [[Orontes River|Orontes]] exceeded the allowable limits.&lt;ref name="NEAP"&gt;The Ministry of State for

{{main article|Smoking in Syria}}
Smoking in Syria is steadily increasing in popularity amongst Syrians, mainly in the forms of [[cigarette]]s or [[Hookah|Narghiles]]. Syrians collectively spend about $600 million per year on tobacco consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mabardi|first=Roueida|title=Smoking Ban Leaves Cafes Empty and Waterpipes Abandoned|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/Apr/29/Syrias-smoking-ban-leaves-cafes-empty-and-water-pipes-abandoned.ashx#ixzz1rQlBkkBg|accessdate=2 May 2012|newspaper=The Daily Star: Lebanon|date=April 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 20% of women and 60% of men smoke and 98% of the overall population is affected by passive smoking.&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera"&gt;{{cite web|title=Smoking Ban Burns Syrian Businesses|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sccQeN89suw|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the assumption that smoking, specifically the narghile, is embedded in Syrian culture, this phenomenon has only recently become widespread.

Despite this, whatsoever, Smoking in Syria has been banned inside [[Coffeehouse|cafe]]s ([[hookah]] bars), restaurants and other [[public space]]s by a presidential [[decree]] which was issued on 12 October 2009 which went into effect on 21 April 2010. [[Syria]] was the first [[Arab country]] to introduce such a ban. The decree also outlaws smoking in schools, universities, health centres, sports halls, cinemas and theaters and on [[public transport]]. The restrictions include the [[narghile]]. According to the official  [[Syrian Arab News Agency]], fines for violating the ban range from 500 to 100,000 [[Syrian pound]]s (US$11 to $2,169).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Syria smoking ban enters into force| newspaper = BBC News| date = 21 April 2010| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8634411.stm| accessdate = 22 April 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

People under the age of 18 are not allowed to buy tobacco in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Healthcare System ==
Syria’s health system is relatively decentralized and focuses on offering primary healthcare at three levels: village, district, and provincial. According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), in 1990 Syria had 41 general [[hospital]]s (33 public, 8 private), 152 specialized hospitals (16 public, 136 private), 391 rural health centers, 151 urban health centers, 79 rural health units, and 49 specialized health centers; [[hospital bed]]s totaled 13,164 (77 percent public, 23 percent private), or 11 beds per 10,000 inhabitants. The number of state hospital beds reportedly fell between 1995 and 2001, while the population had an 18 percent increase, but the opening of new hospitals in 2002 caused the number of hospital beds to double.

WHO reported that in 1989 Syria had a total of 10,114 [[physician]]s, 3,362 [[dentist]]s, and 14,816 [[nurse]]s and [[midwive]]s; in 1995 the rate of health professionals per 10,000 inhabitants was 10.9 physicians, 5.6 dentists, and 21.2 nurses and midwives. Despite overall improvements, Syria’s health system exhibits significant regional disparities in the availability of healthcare, especially between urban and rural areas. The number of private hospitals and doctors increased by 41 percent between 1995 and 2001 as a result of growing demand and growing wealth in a small sector of society. Almost all private health facilities are located in large urban areas such as [[Damascus]], [[Aleppo]], [[Tartus]], and [[Latakia]].&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Syria.pdf Syria country profile].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10562">'''Hospital accreditation''' has been defined as “A self-assessment and external peer assessment process used by health care organizations to accurately assess their level of performance in relation to established standards and to implement ways to continuously improve”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/323/7310/443] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003162940/http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/323/7310/443|date=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critically, accreditation is not just about standard-setting: there are analytical, counseling and self-improvement dimensions to the process.  There are parallel issues in [[evidence-based medicine]], [[quality assurance]] and [[medical ethics]] (see below), and the reduction of [[medical error]] is a key role of the accreditation process. Hospital accreditation is therefore one component in the maintenance of [[patient safety]]. However, there is limited and contested evidence supporting the effectiveness of accreditation programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hinchcliff|first=R|author2=Greenfield, D |author3=Moldovan, M |author4=Westbrook, J.I |author5=Pawsey, M |author6=Mumford, V |author7= Braithwaite, J |title=Narrative synthesis of health service accreditation literature|journal=BMJ Quality and Safety|date=4 October 2012|volume=Online First|doi=10.1136/bmjqs-2012-000852|url=http://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/early/2012/10/03/bmjqs-2012-000852.short?rss=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly speaking, there exist two types of hospital accreditation:
#Hospital and healthcare accreditation which takes place within national borders
#[[International healthcare accreditation]].

==Background==

[[Hospital]]s and [[healthcare]] services are vital components of any well-ordered and humane society, and will indisputably be the recipients of societal resources.  That hospitals should be places of safety, not only for patients but also for the staff and for the general public, is of the greatest importance. Quality of hospitals and healthcare services is also of great interest to many other bodies, including governments, NGOs targeting healthcare and social welfare, professional organisations representing doctors, patient organisations, shareholders of companies providing healthcare services, etc.  However, accreditation schemes are not the same thing as government-controlled initiatives set up to assess healthcare providers with only governmental objectives in mind - ideally, the functioning and finance of hospital accreditation schemes should be independent of governmental control.

How quality is maintained and improved in hospitals and healthcare services is the subject of much debate.  Hospital surveying and accreditation is one recognised means by which this can be achieved.

It is not just an issue of hospital quality.  There are financial factors as well.  For example, in the USA, up until recently the [[Joint Commission]] exercised a ''de facto'' veto over whether or not US hospitals and other health providers were able to participate, and therefore earn from, the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] programs.  This situation has changed in recent years.

==National schemes==
Accreditation schemes recognised as providers of national healthcare accreditation services include:
* [[Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care]] (AAAHC) - based in the United States [http://www.aaahc.org/]
* [[Accreditation Association for Hospitals/Health Systems]] (AAHHS) - based in the United States [http://www.aahhs.org/]
* American Accreditation Commission International (AACI) - based in the United States 
* [[CHKS Ltd]] is a specialist provider of healthcare accreditation programmes based in the UK and accredited to ISQua and ISO 17021:2011 standards www.chks.co.uk
* Malaysian Society for Quality in Health, or MSQH - based in [[Malaysia]][http://www.msqh.com.my/]
* [[QHA Trent Accreditation]] - based in the UK-[[Europe]] [http://www.qha-international.co.uk/home]
* The [https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/our-work/assessment-to-the-nsqhs-standards/ National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards] (NSQHS Standards) developed by the [https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/ Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care] (ACSQHC) 
* Australian Council for Healthcare Standards International, or ACHSI  - based in Australia [http://www.achs.org.au/ACHSI/]

* [[Co.N.A.S.]], National Commission for Accreditation of Hospitals based in Bucharest, Romania [http://www.conas.gov.ro]
* [[National Accreditation Board for Hospitals &amp; Healthcare Providers|National Accreditation Board for Hospitals &amp; Healthcare Providers (NABH)]] based in India 

The different accreditation schemes vary in quality, size, intent and the skill of their marketing. They also vary considerably in terms of the cost incurred by hospitals and healthcare institutions.  They have varying degrees of commitment to assessing [[medical ethics|medical ethical]] standards and clinical standards.

==International schemes==

Some accreditation schemes also undertake [[international healthcare accreditation]] work outside of their base country. One of the large number of accreditation schemes in the United States, the [[Joint Commission]] (TJC) currently being the best known, has created [[Joint Commission International]], or JCI.  In recent years, [[DNV]] have been challenging TJC in the USA. Accreditation Canada accredited its first organization internationally in 1967 in Bermuda [http://www.internationalaccreditation.ca/aboutus/history.aspx]. In 2010, Accreditation Canada International (ACI [http://www.internationalaccreditation.ca]) is created to provide accreditation to hospitals, clinics, primary care centers and health systems. [[Acreditas Global]] [http://www.aaahc.org/international/] (formerly AAAHC International) is present in [[Peru]] since 2012 and [[Costa Rica]].

The former Trent Accreditation Scheme (TAS) from the UK was the first to accredit a hospital in Asia, in Hong Kong in 2000 [http://www.union.org/new/english/about_us/mission.htm], and [[QHA Trent Accreditation]] from the UK have continue to work in the same field.  Since TAS started the process, others, such as [[Joint Commission International|JCI]] and [[Accreditation Canada International|ACI]], have entered the market.

[[DNV Healthcare]] is a Norwegian-US health care accrediting organisation providing a [[quality management system]] constructed in accordance with [[ISO 9001]] and approved by the U.S. [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS)[https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Provider-Enrollment-and-Certification/SurveyCertificationGenInfo/Downloads/CMS-Approved-Accreditation-Organizations.pdf].

[[CHKS Ltd]] is a specialist international provider of healthcare accreditation programmes based in the UK and accredited to ISQua and ISO 17021:2011 standards www.chks.co.uk

AACI is an international accreditation provider based in Hendersonville,NC,USA and accredited to ISQua, as well as ISO 17021:2015 standards [http://www.aacihealthcare.com www.aacihealthcare.com]  

The [http://www.cohsasa.co.za/ Council for Health Service Accreditation of Southern Africa (COHSASA)] is the only internationally accredited quality improvement and accreditation body for healthcare facilities in Africa. In the past 23 years over 600 facilities throughout the continent have entered the COHSASA program to improve the quality and safety of healthcare provided to patients. COHSASA holds a fourth consecutive accreditation by the International Society for Quality in Health Care (ISQua), the global authority responsible for ensuring health accreditors themselves meet standards.

'''Human placental lactogen''' ('''hPL'''), also called '''human chorionic somatomammotropin''' ('''HCS'''), is a [[polypeptide]] [[placenta]]l hormone, the human form of [[placental lactogen]] ([[chorionic]] somatomammotropin). Its structure and function are similar to those of human [[growth hormone]]. It modifies the metabolic state of the mother during [[pregnancy]] to facilitate the energy supply of the [[fetus]]. hPL has anti-[[insulin]] properties. hPL is a hormone secreted by the [[syncytiotrophoblast]] during pregnancy.  Like [[human growth hormone]], hPL is encoded by genes on [[chromosome 17]]q22-24. It was identified in 1963.&lt;ref name="pmid14068826"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Josimovich JB, Atwood BL, Goss DA | title = Luteotrophic, Immunologic and Electrophoretic Properties of Human Placental Lactogen | journal = Endocrinology | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 410–20 |date=October 1963 | pmid = 14068826 | doi = 10.1210/endo-73-4-410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
hPL [[molecular mass]] is 22,125 and contains single chain consisting of 191 [[amino acid]] residues that are linked by two [[disulfide bonds]] and the structure contains 8 helices.  A crystal structure of hPL was determined by [[X-ray diffraction]] to a resolution of [[Angstrom|2.0 Å]].&lt;ref name="pmid16546209"/&gt;

==Levels==
hPL is present only during pregnancy, with maternal serum levels rising  in relation to the growth of the fetus and placenta. Maximum levels are reached near term, typically to 5&amp;ndash;7&amp;nbsp;mg/L (5-7 micrograms/ml)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/408910_2|title=Medscape Log In|website=www.medscape.com|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Higher levels are noted in patients with [[multiple gestation]]. Little hPL enters the fetal circulation. Its [[biological half-life]] is 15 minutes.

==Physiologic function==
hPL affects the metabolic system of the maternal organism in the following manners:

* In a [[bioassay]], hPL mimics the action of [[prolactin]], yet it is unclear whether hPL has any role in human [[lactation]].
* Metabolic:
** ↓ maternal [[insulin]] sensitivity, leading to an increase in maternal blood glucose levels. 
** ↓ maternal glucose utilization, which helps ensure adequate fetal nutrition (the mother responds by increasing beta cells). Chronic [[hypoglycemia]] leads to a rise in hPL.
** ↑ [[lipolysis]] with  the release of [[free fatty acid]]s.  With fasting and release of hPL, free fatty acids become available for the maternal organism as fuel,  so that relatively more [[glucose]] can be utilized by the fetus. Also, [[ketone]]s formed from free fatty acids can cross the [[placenta]] and be used by the fetus.
These functions help support fetal nutrition even in the case of maternal [[malnutrition]].

hPL is a potent [[agonist]] of the [[prolactin receptor]] and a weak agonist of the [[growth hormone receptor]].&lt;ref name="JamesonGroot2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Larry Jameson|author2=Leslie J. De Groot|title=Endocrinology: Adult and Pediatric E-Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xmLeBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2490|date=25 February 2015|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-323-32195-2|pages=2490–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prolactin-like activity===
hPL has been found to bind to the prolactin receptor with equal [[affinity (pharmacology)|affinity]] to that of prolactin in rabbit milk fat gobule membrane, and hPL and prolactin have been found to possess very similar lactogenic activity ''[[in vitro]]'' in mouse and rat [[mammary gland]] [[explant culture|explant]]s.&lt;ref name="Neville2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret Neville|title=Lactation: Physiology, Nutrition, and Breast-Feeding|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNvTBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA150|date=11 November 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4613-3688-4|pages=150–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, hPL has been found to stimulate [[DNA synthesis]] in human mammary [[fibroadenoma]] cells transplanted into mice, which suggests that hPL promotes the growth of the human mammary gland similarly to prolactin.&lt;ref name="Neville2013" /&gt; As hPL circulates at concentrations that are 100-fold higher than those of prolactin during pregnancy, these findings suggest that hPL may play an important role in human [[mammogenesis]] during this time.&lt;ref name="Neville2013" /&gt; However, the relative affinities of hPL and prolactin for the human prolactin receptor have yet to be published and the effects of hPL on normal human mammary epithelial tissue have not yet been investigated, and so a definitive role of hPL in human mammary gland development during pregnancy has not been established at present.&lt;ref name="Neville2013" /&gt;

===Growth hormone-like activity===
hPL has weak actions similar to those of [[growth hormone]], causing the formation of [[protein]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] in the same way that growth hormone, but 100 times more hPL than growth hormone is required to promote growth.&lt;ref name="isbn81-8147-920-3"&gt;{{cite book |author= Guyton and Hall |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |edition=11 |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2005 |origyear= |pages= 1033 |quote= This hormone has weak actions similar to those of [[growth hormone]], causing the formation of [[protein]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] in the same way that growth hormone. |isbn=81-8147-920-3 |oclc= |doi= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, hPL has a blood level of more than 50 times that of hGH&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-06-01|title=Growth Hormone: Reference Range, Interpretation, Collection and Panels|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2089136-overview#a1}}&lt;/ref&gt;, hence its effects must not be ignored. An enhancer for the human placental lactogen gene is found 2 kb downstream of the gene and participates in the cell-specific control gene expression.

==Clinical measurement==
While hPL has been used as an indicator of  fetal well-being and growth, other [[fetal testing]] methods have been found to be more reliable.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Also, normal pregnancies have been reported with undetectable maternal levels of hPL.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13197">'''Joseph G. Ponterotto''' is an American psychologist, author and professor. He is currently a tenured professor of counseling psychology and the  Coordinator of the [[Mental Health Counseling]] Program at [[Fordham University]]'s Graduate School of Education. He is a licensed psychologist and mental health counselor, as well as a psychobiographer and multicultural consultant. His research interests are in acculturation, racism, immigration, multicultural counseling and education, qualitative/quantitative research methods including scale development, the history of psychology, and [[psychobiography]].

Ponterotto is known for his teaching style at Fordham University, wherein he blends both traditional and experiential practices. As a practicing clinician he brings the richness and diversity of the therapeutic process into the curriculum.  He has also contributed over 100 peer-reviewed journal articles, 13 academic books, and other notable works to the field of multicultural counseling, assessment, and research, including the Handbooks of Multicultural Counseling, the Handbooks of Multicultural Assessment, and Preventing Prejudice: A Guide for Counselors, Educators, and Parents. Ponterotto is perhaps best known for his first work of psychobiography titled ''A Psychobiography of [[Bobby Fischer]]: Understanding the Genius, Mystery, and Psychological Decline of a [[World Chess Champion]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://psqtest.typepad.com/blogPostPDFs/201226433_psq_57-41_expertiseInChess.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which also led becoming a historical consultant on the 2015 [[Edward Zwick]]-directed film ''[[Pawn Sacrifice]]'', starring [[Tobey Maguire]] as [[Bobby Fischer]] and [[Liev Schreiber]] as [[Boris Spassky]].&lt;ref name=faculty&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fordham.edu/info/21029/faculty_profiles/3178/joseph_g_ponterotto|title=Joseph G.

==Biography ==
Ponterotto was born and raised in the [[Bronx, New York]]. He entered [[Iona College (New York)|Iona College]] in [[New Rochelle, New York]] in 1976 and attained a bachelor's degree (B.A.) in Psychology. from the education institution In 1980. Soon after, he accepted an invitation into the [[Counseling Psychology]] Program at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].  He started in the Master's program there for the first year and then met his mentor, Dr. Jesus Manual Casas who recommended that he transition into the doctoral program.  Ponterotto credits Casas for inspiring his interests in multicultural research and social advocacy. From September 1981 until his graduation  in May 1985, he was part of a team with his mentor who conducted research in the [[Chicano]] Community. During this time, Ponterotto and Cases engaged in  prolonged discussions on their life experiences and concepts such as unearned privilege, culture, oppression, and injustice. He learned how to reflect on his own heritage and bilingualism and how this ties into important elements of life like identity development and professionalism.&lt;ref name=journey&gt;Ponterotto, J. G. &amp; Duran, E.  (2014). Finding my cultural selves: The journey continues. In M. E. Gallardo (Ed.), Developing cultural humility: Embracing race, privilege and power (pp.&amp;nbsp;27–48).  Los Angeles, CA:  Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Casas became the chair for Ponterretto's [[Doctoral dissertation]], "The Effects of Select Parental Variables, Cognitive Home Stimulation, and Teacher-Child Interactive Behavior on the Academic Performance of Low-Income [[Mexican American]] Children".

Ponterotto credits minority scholars in multicultural research for sustaining his commitment and self-confidence as a graduate student and new professional in the field, including; Thomas Parham, Janet Helms, William Cross, Derald Wing Sue, and first and foremost Casas.&lt;ref name=journey/&gt;

Ponterotto also acknowledges  his faculty colleagues and students at Fordham University for their roles in the evolution of his professional career, particularly his interest in qualitative research and how it can inform multicultural counseling. Since his arrival in 1987, Dr. Ponterotto cites Fordham leaders such as Leo Goldman and [[Merle Keitel]] for creating an academic environment that emphasized qualitative research. He also thanks his students, especially those he mentored in his early career, for shedding light on how these methods can be administered to thoroughly learn about a specific multicultural population while also generating a sense of social justice that honors and benefits the research participants as well as advancing science.&lt;ref name=journey/&gt;

==Career==
Ponterotto is a tenured professor with over 30 years of teaching and administrative experience in the field of psychology.  From 1985 until 1987 he held the position of Assistant Professor in Counseling Psychology within the Department of Educational Psychology at the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]]. In 1987, he joined Fordham University's Graduate School of Education as an Assistant Professor of Counseling Psychology in the Division of Psychological and Educational Services (PES).  Over the years at Fordham he was promoted to Associate and then Full Professor and has held a number of administrative positions.  Presently, he coordinates the master's degree program in [[Mental Health Counseling]].

Ponterotto primarily teaches Master's and Doctoral students from a vast range of programs, such as;  school psychology, clinical psychology, mental health counseling, school counseling, and counseling psychology. He regularly teaches courses in multicultural counseling, psychological measurement and assessment, career counseling, quantitative/qualitative research methods, and history of psychology.&lt;ref name=faculty/&gt;

==Counseling and supervision ==
Ponterotto's professional work as a clinician started in 1981 when he saw his first clients while a graduate student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 1984 he attained the position of Clinic Coordinator and Supervisor of the Counseling Psychology Training Clinic at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 1985, he became a counselor and supervisor at the Educational Psychology Training Clinic for the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and was later promoted to Director from 1986 to 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/author/joseph-g-ponterotto|title=Ponterotto, Joseph - SAGE Publications Inc|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, he opened his own small psychotherapy practice in New York City, where he specializes in examining the impact of different social-cultural contexts on the individual person, families, and career development. He also helps gifted clients (e.g., [[chess prodigies]]) pursue their talents while also managing healthy and balanced aspects of everyday life.

==Awards and honors==
Ponterotto has received several awards and honors that are university-based, national, and international. In 1994, he was a co-winner of the "Early Career Scientist/Practitioner Award," given by [[American Psychological Association|APA]]'s Division 17. As a faculty member, he has received the Distinguished Contribution to Multicultural Education Award (1997-1998) and Scanlon Award (2003) from the Graduate School of Education. In 2007, he earned the Bene Merenti Award for 20 years of service at Fordham University. That same year he received the honor of "Distinguished Alumnus-Research and Scholarship" by the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In addition, he was presented the "Visionary Leadership Award" at the APA National Multicultural Conference and Summit in Seattle, Washington. He also received the 17th Annual Janet E. Helms Award for Mentoring and Scholarship from [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] at the 24th Winter Roundtable on Cultural Psychology and Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.fordham.edu/inside-fordham-category/ponterotto-receives-helms-award-for-mentoring-and-scholarship/|title=Ponterotto Receives Helms Award for Mentoring and Scholarship|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research contributions==
Ponterotto contributes to research in psychology by essentially working "behind the scenes" of publishing academic literature and other resources, where he has served on editorial boards for various scholarly journals and book publishers.  He is also a former Associate Editor of the [[Journal of Counseling Psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/special/2115202.aspx|title=Knowledge in Context: Qualitative Methods in Counseling Psychology Research|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ponterotto is an active researcher who has published over 100 peer-reviewed journal articles, which commenced while in his graduate studies. His research interests mirror the subjects he teaches, as he explores topics such as acculturation, racism, immigration, multicultural counseling and education, and qualitative/quantitative research methods.  For example, Dr. Ponterotto emphasizes throughout his works that qualitative inquiry approaches such as interviews with participants and their families are highly imperative for research, practice, training, empowering, and honoring different ethnicities, races, cultures and their respective beliefs, values, and traditions. This view is evident within his most cited article named "Qualitative Research in Counseling Psychology: A Primer on Research Paradigms and Philosophy of Science." Published in 2005, this article presented an overview of research paradigms that have been used by psychologists in theory and practice and specifically urges that qualitative methods and other research alternatives are taken into account in order to effectively train future students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/cou/52/2/126/|title=Qualitative research in counseling psychology: A primer on research paradigms and philosophy of science.|first=Joseph G.|last=Ponterotto|date=1 April 2005|publisher=|volume=52|issue=2|pages=126–136|accessdate=24 April 2017|doi=10.1037/0022-0167.52.2.126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ponterotto is well known in academia for developing and advocating for innovative measures or scales (e.g., survey instruments) that are sensitive to cultural and ethnic differences to ensure that any research conducted or treatment initiatives are valid, appropriate, and inclusive.  He is co-developer of the Quick Discrimination Index, the Teacher Multicultural Attitude Survey, the Multicultural Counseling Knowledge and Awareness Scale, and most recently, the Multicultural Personality Inventory.  These measures are used worldwide.

Ponterotto is the co-author and or co-editor of 13 educational books.   Ponterotto is also the author of a  psychobiography (his first) on Bobby Fischer, titled  ''A Psychobiography of Bobby Fisher: Understanding the Genius, Mystery, and Psychological Decline of a World Chess Champion''. Being an avid chess player himself,  Ponterotto decided to perform a detailed psychological evaluation on the trajectory of Bobby Fischer's life from his fame as a chess grandmaster at 15, which turned him into an international star and his being recognized as a prodigal genius, to his pitfalls and bizarre behaviors over time that ultimately led to his exile and death. His 2012 book is based on four years of research that included interviews with surviving family members, friends, chess masters, journalists, and biographers who knew Fischer as well as reviews of archives and available, [[FBI]] files related to the Fischer family. Based on the piecing together this agglomerated data, he was able to draw major conclusions that highlight Fischer's extraordinary intelligence and mental health challenges.  Ponterotto's psychobiography notably grabbed the attention of the producers of the 2015 major motion picture ''Pawn Sacrifice'', for which he served as a historical consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.fordham.edu/education-and-social-services/new-major-motion-picture-owes-its-historical-accuracy-to-fordham-education-professor/|title=New Major Motion Picture Owes Its Historical Accuracy to Fordham Education Professor|publisher=|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Kava was historically grown only in the Pacific islands of Hawaii, Federated States of [[Micronesia]], [[Vanuatu]], [[Fiji]], the [[Samoa]]s and [[Tonga]]. An [[inventory]] of ''P. methysticum'' distribution showed it was cultivated on numerous islands of Micronesia, [[Melanesia]], [[Polynesia]], and [[Hawaii]], whereas specimens of ''P. wichmannii'' were all from [[Papua New Guinea]], the [[Solomon Islands]], and Vanuatu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Vincent Lebot|author2=Patricia Siméoni|title=Is the Quality of Kava (Piper methysticum Forst. f.) Responsible for Different Geographical Patterns?|journal=Ethnobotany Research &amp; Applications|date=2004|volume=2|pages=19–28|url=https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/135/4/I1547-3465-02-019.pdf|doi=10.17348/era.2.0.19-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kava shrub thrives in loose, well-drained soils where plenty of air reaches the roots. It grows naturally where rainfall is plentiful (over 2,000&amp;nbsp;mm/yr). Ideal growing conditions are {{convert|70|-|95|°F|°C}} and 70–100% relative humidity. Too much sunlight is harmful, especially in early growth, so kava is an [[understory]] crop.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Kava cannot reproduce sexually. Female flowers are especially rare and do not produce fruit even when hand-pollinated. Its cultivation is entirely by propagation from stem [[cutting (plant)|cuttings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.hawaii.edu/~strauch/PlantTropics/PropCanoePlants.html#awa|title=Notes on Propagating Traditional Hawaiian Plants|last=|first=|date=|website=FoodPlant Tropics|access-date=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, plants are harvested around four years of age, as older plants have higher concentrations of kavalactones. After reaching about 2 m height, plants grow a wider stalk and additional stalks, but not much taller. The roots can reach a depth of 60&amp;nbsp;cm.

=== Cultivars ===
[[File:John LaFarge - Young Girls Preparing Kava Outside of the Hut Whose Posts Are Decorated wih Flowers.jpg|thumb|Women preparing kava, by [[John La Farge]], c. 1891]]
Kava consists of sterile cultivars cloned from its wild ancestor, ''Piper wichmanii''.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt; Today it comprises hundreds of different cultivars grown across the Pacific. Each cultivar has not only different requirements for successful cultivation, but also displays unique characteristics both in terms of its appearance, and in terms of its psychoactive properties.&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;

==== Noble and non-noble kava ====
Scholars make a distinction between the so-called "noble" and non-noble kava. The latter category comprises the so-called "tudei" (or "two-day") kavas, medicinal kavas and wild kava (''Piper wichmanii'', the ancestor of domesticated ''Piper methysticum'').&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Teschke 2503–2516"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teschke|first=Rolf|last2=Lebot|first2=Vincent|date=2011-10-01|title=Proposal for a Kava Quality Standardization Code|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027869151100319X|journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology|volume=49|issue=10|pages=2503–2516|doi=10.1016/j.fct.2011.06.075|pmid=21756963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, only noble kavas have been used for regular consumption due to their more favourable composition of kavalactones and other compounds that produce more pleasant effects and have lower potential for causing negative side-effects, such as nausea or "kava hangover".&lt;ref name=:1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuchta 1647–1653"/&gt;

The perceived benefits of noble cultivars explain why only these cultivars were spread around the Pacific by Polynesian and Melanesian migrants, with presence of non-noble cultivars limited to the islands of Vanuatu from which they originated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More recently, it has been suggested that the widespread use of tudei cultivars in the manufacturing of several kava products might have been the key factor contributing to the rare reports of adverse reactions to kava observed among the consumers of kava-based products in Europe.&lt;ref name="Kuchta 1647–1653"/&gt;

Tudei varieties have traditionally not been grown in Hawaii and Fiji, but in recent years there have been reports of farmers attempting to grow "isa" or "palisi" non-noble cultivars in Hawaii and of imports of dried tudei kava into Fiji for further re-exporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=262207|title=Drink the right mix - Fiji Times Online|website=www.fijitimes.com|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tudei cultivars may be easier and cheaper to grow, while it takes up to 5 years for noble kava to mature, non-noble varieties can often be harvested just one year after being planted.

The concerns about the adverse effects of non-noble varieties produced by their undesirable composition of kavalactones and high concentrations of potentially harmful compounds ([[flavokavain]]s), that are not present in any significant concentration in the noble varieties, have led to legislation prohibiting exports from such countries as Vanuatu.&lt;ref name="Kuchta 1647–1653"/&gt; Likewise, efforts have been made to educate the non-traditional customers about the difference between noble and non-noble varieties and that non-noble varieties do not offer the same results as noble cultivars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/289424/vanuatu-hopes-for-kava-export-growth|title=Vanuatu hopes for kava export growth|date=2015-11-11|website=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/programmes/datelinepacific/audio/201778477/vanuatu-kava-cleared-for-european-market|title=Vanuatu kava cleared for European market|date=2015-11-12|website=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, government regulatory bodies and non-profit NGOs have been set up with the declared aim of monitoring kava quality, producing regular reports, certifying vendors selling proper, noble kava and warning customers against products that may contain tudei varieties.&lt;ref name="teschke2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teschke|first=Rolf|last2=Sarris|first2=Jerome|last3=Lebot|first3=Vincent|date=2011-01-15|title=Kava hepatotoxicity solution: A six-point plan for new kava standardization|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S094471131000303X|journal=Phytomedicine|volume=18|issue=2–3|pages=96–103|doi=10.1016/j.phymed.2010.10.002|pmid=21112196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Growing regions ====
In Vanuatu, exportation of kava is strictly regulated. Only strains they deem as "noble" varieties that are not too weak or too potent are allowed to be exported. Only the most desirable strains for everyday drinking are selected to be noble varieties to maintain quality control. In addition, their laws mandate that exported kava must be at least five years old and farmed organically. Their most popular noble strains are "Boroguu" or "Boronggoru" from [[Pentecost Island]], "Melomelo" from [[Aoba Island]] (called ''sese'' in north [[Pentecost Island]]), and "Palarasul" kava from [[Espiritu Santo]]. In Vanuatu, Tudei ("two days") kava is reserved for special ceremonial occasions and exporting it is not allowed. "Palisi" is a popular Tudei variety.

In [[Hawaii]], there are many other strains of kava ({{lang-haw|ʻawa}}). Some of the most popular strains are the ''Mahakea'', ''Moʻi'', ''Hiwa'' and ''Nene'' varieties. The ''[[Aliʻi]]'' (kings) of [[History of Hawaii|precolonial Hawaii]] coveted the ''Moʻi'' variety, which had a strong cerebral effect due to a predominant amount of the [[kavalactone]] kavain. This sacred variety was so important to them that no one but royalty could ever experience it, "lest they suffer an untimely death". The reverence for Hiwa in old Hawaiʻi is evident in this portion of a chant recorded by [[Nathaniel Bright Emerson]] and quoted by E. S. Craighill and Elizabeth Green Handy. "This refers to the cup of sacramental ʻawa brewed from the strong, black ʻawa root (ʻawa hiwa) which was drunk sacramentally by the kumu hula":

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The day of revealing shall see what it sees:
A seeing of facts, a sifting of rumors,
An insight won by the black sacred ʻawa,
A vision like that of a sacred god!{{cite quote|date=October 2017}}&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Winter describes a [[hula]] prayer for inspiration which contains the line, ''He ʻike pū ʻawa hiwa.'' Pukui and Elbert translated this as "a knowledge from kava offerings". Winter explains that ʻawa, especially of the Hiwa variety, was offered to hula deities in return for knowledge and inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/hawaiian-awa-views-of-an-ethnobotanical-treasure/oclc/77501873|title=Hawaiian ʻawa: views of an ethnobotanical treasure|last=Johnston|first=Ed|last2=Rogers|first2=Helen|last3=Association for Hawaiian ʻAwa|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Association for Hawaiian ʻAwa|location=Hilo, Hawaii|page=34|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relationship with kawakawa ====
Kawakawa (''[[Macropiper excelsum|Piper excelsum]]'') plant, known also as "Maori kava", may be confused with kava. While the two plants look similar and have similar names, they are different but related species. Kawakawa is a small tree endemic to New Zealand, having importance to traditional medicine and [[Māori culture]]. As noted by the Kava Society of New Zealand, "in all likelihood, the kava plant was known to the first settlers of Aotearoa [New Zealand]. It is also possible that (just like the Polynesian migrants that settled in Hawaii) the Maori explorers brought some kava with them. Unfortunately, most of New Zealand is simply too cold for growing kava and hence the Maori settlers lost their connection to the sacred plant."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kavasociety.nz/blog/2018/2/5/kava-vs-kawakawa-and-the-maori-memories-of-kava|title=Kava vs Kawakawa {{!}} Kava use in New Zealand {{!}} Maori Memories of Kava|last=|first=|date=|website=kavasociety.nz|access-date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, "in New Zealand, where the climate is too cold for kava, the Maori gave the name kawa-kawa to another ''Piperaceae M. excelsum'', in memory of the kava plants they undoubtedly brought with them and unsuccessfully attempted to cultivate. The Maori word kawa also means "ceremonial protocol", recalling the stylized consumption of the drug typical of Polynesian societies".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kawakawa is commonly used in Maori traditional medicine for the treatment of skin infections, wounds and cuts, and (when prepared as a tea) for stomach upsets and other minor illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://maoriplantuse.landcareresearch.co.nz/WebForms/PeoplePlantsDetails.aspx?firstcome=firstcome&amp;PKey=DF6C4669-4A57-4473-8B3F-CE49593273A2|title=Māori Plant Use Database Plant Use Details of Macropiper excelsum|website=maoriplantuse.landcareresearch.co.nz|access-date=2016-07-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811031207/http://maoriplantuse.landcareresearch.co.nz/WebForms/PeoplePlantsDetails.aspx?firstcome=firstcome&amp;PKey=DF6C4669-4A57-4473-8B3F-CE49593273A2|archivedate=11 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Composition ===
Fresh kava root contains on average 80% [[water]]. Dried root contains approximately 43% [[starch]], 20% [[dietary fibre|dietary fiber]], 15% [[kavalactone]]s,&lt;ref name=wang/&gt; 12% water, 3.2% [[sugar]]s, 3.6% [[protein (nutrient)|protein]], and 3.2% [[micronutrient|minerals]].

In general, kavalactone content is greatest in the roots and decreases higher up the plant into the stems and leaves.&lt;ref name=wang/&gt; Relative concentrations of 15%, 10% and 5% have been observed in the root, stump, and basal stems, respectively.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The relative content of kavalactones depends not only on plant segment, but also on the kava plant varieties, plant maturity, geographic location, and time of harvest.&lt;ref name=wang/&gt; The kavalactones present are [[kavain]], [[demethoxyyangonin]] and [[yangonin]], which are higher in the roots than in the stems and leaves, with [[dihydrokavain]], [[methysticin]], and [[dihydromethysticin]] also present.&lt;ref name=wang/&gt;

The mature roots of the kava plant are harvested after a minimum of four years (at least five years ideally) for peak kavalactone content. Most kava plants produce around {{convert|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of root when they are harvested. Kava root is classified into two categories: crown root (or chips) and lateral root. Crown roots are the large-diameter pieces that look like ({{convert|1.5|to|5|in|mm}} diameter) wooden poker chips. Most kava plants consist of approximately 80% crown root upon harvesting. Lateral roots are smaller-diameter roots that look more like a typical root. A mature kava plant is about 20% lateral roots. Kava lateral roots have the highest content of kavalactones in the kava plant. "Waka" grade kava is made of lateral roots only.

Potentiation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activity may underlie the [[anxiolytic]] effects of kava, while elevation of dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens likely underlie the moderately [[psychotropic]] effects the plant can produce.

===Detection===
Recent usage of kava has been documented in forensic investigations by quantitation of kavain in blood specimens. The principal urinary metabolite, conjugated 4'-OH-kavain, is generally detectable for up to 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;R.

== Preparations==
[[File:Kava fiji.jpg|thumb|right|Kava root drying in [[Lovoni]] village, [[Ovalau (Fiji)|Ovalau]], [[Fiji]]]]

=== Traditional preparation ===
Kava is consumed in various ways throughout the [[Pacific Ocean]] cultures of [[Polynesia]], [[Vanuatu]], [[Melanesia]] and some parts of [[Micronesia]] and [[Australia]]. Traditionally, it is prepared by either chewing, grinding or pounding the roots of the kava plant. Grinding is done by hand against a cone-shaped block of dead [[coral]]; the hand forms a [[Mortar and pestle|mortar]] and the coral a [[pestle]]. The ground root/bark is combined with only a little water, as the fresh root releases moisture during grinding. Pounding is done in a large stone with a small log. The product is then added to cold water and consumed as quickly as possible.

The extract is an [[emulsion]] of kavalactone droplets in starch and buttermilk. The taste is slightly pungent, while the distinctive aroma depends on whether it was prepared from dry or fresh plant, and on the variety. The colour is grey to tan to opaque greenish.

Kava prepared as described above is much more potent than processed kava. Chewing produces the strongest effect because it produces the finest particles. Fresh, undried kava produces a stronger beverage than dry kava. The strength also depends on the species and techniques of cultivation. Many find mixing powdered kava with hot water makes the drink stronger.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In Vanuatu, a strong kava drink is normally followed by a hot meal or tea. The meal traditionally follows some time after the drink so the [[psychoactive]]s are absorbed into the bloodstream quicker. Traditionally, no flavoring is added.

In Papua New Guinea, the locals in Madang province refer to their kava as ''waild koniak'' ("wild cognac" in English).

[[Fijians]] commonly share a drink called ''grog'' made by pounding sun-dried kava root into a fine powder, straining and mixing it with cold water. Traditionally, grog is drunk from the shorn half-shell of a coconut, called a ''bilo''. Grog is very popular in [[Fiji]], especially among young men, and often brings people together for storytelling and socializing. Drinking grog for a few hours brings a numbing and relaxing effect to the drinker; grog also numbs the tongue and grog drinking typically is followed by a "chaser" or sweet or spicy snack to follow a ''bilo''.

[[Pharmaceutical]] and [[herbal supplement]] companies extract kavalactones from the kava plant using solvents such as [[supercritical carbon dioxide]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Viorica|first=Lopez-Aila|title=Supercritical fluid extraction of kava lactones from Piper methysticum (kava) herb|doi=10.1002/jhrc.1240201007|volume=20|issue=10|year=1997|journal=Journal of High Resolution Chromatography|pages=555–559}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[acetone]] and [[ethanol]] to produce pills standardized with between 30% and 90% kavalactones.&lt;ref name=teschke2011/&gt;

Numerous scholars&lt;ref name="teschke16" /&gt; and regulatory bodies&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; have raised concerns over the safety profile of such products.

One group of scholars say that organic solvents introduce compounds that can affect the liver into the standardized product; these compounds are not extracted by water and consequently largely absent from kava prepared with water.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraft|first=M|last2=Spahn|first2=T W|last3=Menzel|first3=J|last4=Senninger|first4=N|last5=Dietl|first5=K.-H|last6=Herbst|first6=H|last7=Domschke|first7=W|last8=Lerch|first8=M M|date=2001|title=Fulminantes Leberversagen nach Einnahme des pflanzlichen Antidepressivums Kava-Kava|url=https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/11544547|journal=DMW - Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift|language=en|volume=126|issue=36|pages=970–972|doi=10.1055/s-2001-16966|pmid=11544547|issn=0012-0472}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when compared with water extraction, organic solvents extract vastly larger amounts of flavokavains, compounds associated with adverse reactions to kava that are present in very low concentrations in noble kava, but significant in non-noble.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhou|first=Ping|last2=Gross|first2=Shimon|last3=Liu|first3=Ji-Hua|last4=Yu|first4=Bo-Yang|last5=Feng|first5=Ling-Ling|last6=Nolta|first6=Jan|last7=Sharma|first7=Vijay|last8=Piwnica-Worms|first8=David|last9=Qiu|first9=Samuel X.|date=December 2010|title=Flavokawain B, the hepatotoxic constituent from kava root, induces GSH-sensitive oxidative stress through modulation of IKK/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2992378/|journal=The FASEB Journal|volume=24|issue=12|pages=4722–4732|doi=10.1096/fj.10-163311|issn=0892-6638|pmc=2992378|pmid=20696856}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuchta 1647–1653" /&gt;

Also "chemical solvents used do not extract the same compounds as the natural water extracts in traditional use. The extraction process may exclude important modifying constituents soluble only in water".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In particular, it has been noted that, unlike traditional, water-based preparations, products obtained with the use of organic solvents do not contain [[glutathione]], an important liver-protecting compound.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003-10-01|title=Kava lactones and the kava-kava controversy|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031942203003819|journal=Phytochemistry|language=en|volume=64|issue=3|pages=673–679|doi=10.1016/S0031-9422(03)00381-9|issn=0031-9422|last1=Whitton|first1=Peter A|last2=Lau|first2=Andrew|last3=Salisbury|first3=Alicia|last4=Whitehouse|first4=Julie|last5=Evans|first5=Christine S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another group of researchers noted: "The extraction process (aqueous vs. acetone in the two types of preparations) is responsible for the difference in toxicity as extraction of glutathione in addition to the kava lactones is important to provide protection against hepatotoxicity".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

It has also been argued that kavalactone extracts have often been made from low-quality plant material, including the toxic aerial parts of the plant, non-noble kava varieties, or plants affected by mold, which, in light of the chemical solvents' ability to extract far greater amounts of the potentially toxic compounds than water, makes them particularly problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.docdroid.net/jHcw2HK/11-0303-march2011-ahpa-report-kava-special-report.pdf|title=11_0303_March2011_AHPA_Report_Kava_Special_Report.pdf|access-date=2018-09-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuchta 1647–1653" /&gt;

In the context of these concerns, the [[World Health Organization]] advises against the consumption of ethanolic and acetonic kavalactone extracts, and says that "products should be developed from water-based suspensions of kava".&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2KXWY6kPESUC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=%22products+should+be+developed+from+water-based+suspensions+of+kava%22+WHO#v=onepage&amp;q=%22products%20should%20be%20developed%20from%20water-based%20suspensions%20of%20kava%22%20WHO&amp;f=false|title=Assessment of the Risk of Hepatotoxicity with Kava Products|last=Organization|first=World Health|date=2007|publisher=WHO Regional Office Europe|isbn=9789241595261|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governments of New Zealand and Australia prohibit the sales of such kavalactone extracts, and only permit the sale of kava products in their natural form or produced with cold water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2011C00587|title=Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code - Standard 2.6.3 - Kava|last=Health|website=www.legislation.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kava culture ===
[[File:Kava.JPG|thumb|A sign showing a "Kava licence area" at [[Yirrkala]], in the [[Northern Territory]] of [[Australia]]]]
{{Main|Kava culture}}

Kava is used for medicinal, religious, political, cultural and social purposes throughout the Pacific. These cultures have a great respect for the plant and place a high importance on it. In Fiji, for example, a formal ''yaqona'' (kava) ceremony will often accompany important social, political, or religious functions, usually involving a ritual presentation of the bundled roots as a ''sevusevu'' (gift), and drinking of the ''yaqona'' itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Biturogoiwasa |first1=Solomoni |first2=Anthony R. |last2=Walker |year=2001 |title=My Village, My World: Everyday Life in Nadoria, Fiji |location=Suva, Fiji |publisher=Institute of Pacific Studies, University of the South Pacific |pages=17–20 |isbn=978-982-02-0160-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tomlinson |first1=Matt |year=2007 |title=Everything and Its Opposite: Kava Drinking in Fiji |journal=Anthropological Quarterly |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=1065–81 |doi=10.1353/anq.2007.0054}}{{synthesis inline|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the importance of kava in religious rituals and the seemingly (from the Western point of view) unhygienic preparation method, its consumption was discouraged or even banned by Christian missionaries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Kava bars ===
{{see also|Nakamal}}
With kava's increasing popularity, bars serving the plant in its liquid state are beginning to open up outside of the South Pacific.&lt;ref name="Kuchta 1647–1653" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/22/nyregion/in-brooklyn-a-hare-krishna-reckoning.html|title=In Brooklyn, a Hare Krishna Reckoning|first=Kaya|last=Laterman|date=22 December 2017|publisher=|accessdate=22 December 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some bars have been committed to only serving the traditional forms and types of kava, other establishments have been accused of serving non-traditionally consumed non-noble kava varieties which are cheaper, but far more likely to cause unpleasant effects and adverse reactions, or of serving kava with other substances, including alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/news/south-florida-kava-bars-unworried-about-two-day-kava-6452978|title=South Florida Kava Bars Unworried about Two-Day Kava|last=Swanson|first=Jess|date=2014-03-20|access-date=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of consumption ==

The nature of effects will largely depend on the strain of the kava plant and the form of its consumption.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Traditionally, only noble kava cultivars have been consumed as they are accepted as safe and produce desired effects.&lt;ref name="Lebot 554–560"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lebot|first=V.|last2=Do|first2=T.

As noted in one of the earliest Western publications on kava (1886): "A well prepared Kava potion drunk in small quantities produces only pleasant changes in behavior. It is therefore a slightly stimulating drink which helps relieve great fatigue. It relaxes the body after strenuous efforts, clarifies the mind and sharpens the mental faculties".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S2FnAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=%22listening+to+kava%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Kava: Medicine Hunting in Paradise: The Pursuit of a Natural Alternative to Anti-Anxiety Drugs and Sleeping Pills|last=Kilham|first=Christopher S.|date=1996-06-01|publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co|isbn=9781620550342|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to contemporary descriptions:
{{quote|Kava seizes one’s mind. This is not a literal seizure, but something does change in the processes by which information enters, is retrieved, or leads to actions as a result. Thinking is certainly affected by the kava experience, but not in the same ways as are found from caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, or marijuana. I would personally characterize the changes I experienced as going from lineal processing of information to a greater sense of "being" and contentment with being. Memory seemed to be enhanced, whereas restriction of data inputs was strongly desired, especially with regard to disturbances of light, movements, noise and so on. Peace and quiet were very important to maintain the inner sense of serenity. My senses seemed to be unusually sharpened, so that even whispers seemed to be loud while loud noises were extremely unpleasant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;}}

{{quote|When the mixture is not too strong, the subject attains a state of happy unconcern, well-being and contentment, free of physical or psychological excitement. At the beginning conversation comes in a gentle, easy flow and hearing and sight are honed, becoming able to perceive subtle shades of sound and vision. Kava soothes temperaments. The drinker never becomes angry, unpleasant, quarrelsome or noisy, as happens with alcohol. Both natives and whites consider kava as a means of easing moral discomfort. The drinker remains master of his conscience and reason.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;}}

Despite its psychoactive effects, kava is not considered to be physically addictive and its use does not lead to dependency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lebot|first=V.|last2=Lèvesque|first2=J.|date=1989-01-01|title=The origin and distribution of kava (Piper methysticum Forst.

==Toxicity, safety and potential side effects==

=== General observations ===
A 2016 comprehensive review of kava safety conducted by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) concluded that: "On balance, the weight-of-evidence from both a long history of use of kava beverage and from the more recent research findings indicates that it is possible for kava beverage to be consumed with an acceptably low level of health risk".&lt;ref name="fao-who" /&gt; The authors of the review noted that:

{{quote|Kava beverage has a long history of consumption in the South Pacific and has an important role in traditional community ceremonies. In recent times, it has become more widely consumed as a recreational beverage in both the South Pacific islander community as well as in the wider international community. Within these communities, kava is considered to be a safe and enjoyable beverage, based on a long tradition of use and little evidence of harm. There is little documented evidence of adverse health effects associated with traditional moderate levels of consumption of kava beverage, with only anecdotal reports of general symptoms of lethargy and headaches.Whether this reflects genuine low incidence or an under-reporting of adverse health effects is unclear. Clinical trials examining the efficacy of aqueous extracts of kava in treating anxiety, although limited, have also not identified adverse health effects.&lt;ref name="fao-who" /&gt;}}

At the same time, it was observed that:

{{quote|On the other hand, there is strong evidence that high levels of consumption of kava beverage can result in scaly skin rash, weight loss, nausea, loss of appetite and indigestion. These adverse health effects, while significant, are considered to be reversible upon cessation of kava use. Other possible effects include sore red eyes, laziness, loss of sex drive and general poor health. No effect on cognition, which might be associated with the pharmacological activity of kava, has been identified. No information is available on the potential for kava beverage consumption to impact on the incidence of chronic disease. Moderate to high kava beverage consumption also produces a reversible increase in the liver enzyme gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), which may be an early indicator of [[cholestasis]]. Clinical surveys in Aboriginal communities in northern Australia with a history of heavy kava use have not revealed any evidence of long-term liver damage associated with consumption of kava beverage.&lt;ref name="fao-who" /&gt;}}

A human health risk assessment conducted by the Australian and New Zealand governments concluded that:

{{quote|The available data indicates that traditional kava beverage prepared from the root has a long tradition of safe use in the South Pacific Islands. It is compositionally different from kava products prepared by extraction using organic solvents. While excessive consumption of the traditional kava beverage may lead to adverse health effects, such as kava dermopathy'' [see below], ''there is no evidence that occasional use of kava beverage is associated with any long-term adverse effects. (...) The available data (...) does not suggest any specific health problems associated with moderate use of kava beverage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;}}

=== Effects on the liver ===
According to a 2010 discussion paper prepared for the [[Codex Alimentarius Commission]]: "kava has had at least a 1500-year history of relatively safe use, with liver side effects never having arisen in the ethnopharmacological data. (...) Clinical trials of kava have not revealed hepatotoxicity as a problem. This has been confirmed by further studies evaluating the toxicology of kava drink. ''Based on available scientific information it can be inferred that kava as a traditional beverage is safe for human consumption''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discussion paper on the development of a standard for kava|date=1 October 2010|url=http://www.ikec.org/sites/default/files/Codex%20alimentarius%20kava_draft_0.pdf|publisher=Codex Alimentarius Commission, United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, concerns were raised about the safety of kava, which led to restrictions and regulations in several countries,&lt;ref name=pmid21073405/&gt; as well as reports by the United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | title=Hepatic Toxicity Possibly Associated with Kava-Containing Products – United States, Germany, and Switzerland, 1999&amp;nbsp;2002 | journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | year=2002 | volume=51 | pages=1065–1067 | url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5147a1.htm | accessdate=16 September 2005 | issue=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Center for Food Safety |author2=Applied Nutrition | title=Kava-Containing Dietary Supplements May Be Associated with Severe Liver Injury | publisher=United States Food and Drug Administration | year=2002 | url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/addskava.html | accessdate=16 June 2005 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325210855/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/addskava.html | archivedate=25 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the media reports from Europe, 2002 the US FDA issued a (now archived) Consumer Advisory stating that, "Kava-Containing Dietary Supplements May be Associated With Severe Liver Injury."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm085482.htm|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|title=Consumer Advisory: Kava-Containing Dietary Supplements May be Associated With Severe Liver Injury|date=25 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likwise, LiverTox of the [[National Library of Medicine]]/[[National Institutes of Health]] noted that: "The frequency of adverse reactions to kava, particularly liver injury, is not known...Between 50 and 100 cases of clinically apparent liver injury have been published or discussed in the literature. Advocates for the herb have strongly rejected these numbers, disputing both their accuracy and the causality assessment process. Still, there seem to be convincing evidence in some cases of severe hepatitis ending in fulminant hepatic failure, requiring liver transplantation, and even leading to death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://livertox.nih.gov/KavaKava.htm|title=Kava kava|date=6 December 2016|publisher=National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, Bethesda, MD|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the concerns were related to a small number of reports indicating potential cases of [[hepatotoxicity]] caused by consumption of various commercial products derived from kava. A number of scientists and medical practitioners criticized the poor quality of the reports by pointing out that most of the reported rare cases of hepatotoxicity involved patients with a history of alcohol or prescription drugs abuse or concomitant use of medicines known as potentially hepatotoxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 41301937|title = Tradition and toxicity: Evidential cultures in the kava safety debate|last = Baker|first = Jonathan|date = 2011|journal = Social Studies of Science|doi = 10.1177/0306312710395341|pmid = 21879526|volume=41|issue = 3|pages=361–384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the Australian studies from the late 1990s suggesting an association between health problems and heavy kava use&lt;ref name="health.gov.au"&gt;[http://www.health.gov.au/internet/drugstrategy/publishing.nsf/Content/545C92F95DF8C76ACA257162000DA780/$File/indigenous-background.pdf "National Drug Strategy - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Complementary Action Plan 2003–2009 - Background Paper"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005112731/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/drugstrategy/publishing.nsf/Content/545C92F95DF8C76ACA257162000DA780/$File/indigenous-background.pdf |date=5 October 2009 }}.

More rigorous clinical research has found no evidence of any significant negative health issues (including any irreversible liver damage) that could be linked to kava.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clough|first=Alan R.|last2=Bailie|first2=Ross S.|last3=Currie|first3=Bart|date=2003-01-01|title=Liver Function Test Abnormalities in Users of Aqueous Kava Extracts|journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology|volume=41|issue=6|pages=821–829|doi=10.1081/CLT-120025347|issn=0731-3810|pmid=14677792}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of this information and subsequent research&lt;ref name="Kuchta 1647–1653" /&gt; on 10 June 2014, the German Administrative Court overturned the 2002 ban reinstating the regulatory requirements of 2001. The court stated that risk from kava exposure had not been clearly demonstrated, nor does it appear unusually high, an opinion presumably driven by the very small number of cases of reported toxicity (n ~ 3) with even a certain degree of causality linked to kava in a global kava-consuming community that may number in the millions of doses consumed daily.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to one comprehensive review: "Despite the link to kava and liver toxicity demonstrated in vivo and in vitro, in the history of Western kava use, toxicity is still considered relatively rare. Only a fraction of the handful of cases reviewed for liver toxicity could be, with any certainty, linked to kava consumption and most of those involved the co-ingestion of other medications/supplements. That means that the incident rate of liver toxicity due to kava is one in 60-125 million patients."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to an in-depth human health risk assessment commissioned by the New Zealand and Australian governments, while consumption of kava may result in such minor and reversible side effects as kava dermopathy (see below), ''"there is no evidence that occasional use of kava beverage is associated with any long-term adverse effects, including effects on the liver.''"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2016-05-25|title=Kava: A Human Health Risk Assessment|url=http://www.foodstandards.govt.nz/publications/documents/30_Kava1.pdf|journal=Technical Report Series No 30|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent publications also confirm that noble kava roots appear to be safe and that the previously reported rare cases of hepatotoxicity were in most cases likely related to rare allergic reactions or the poor quality of the plant material, including unsuitable cultivars or parts of the plant and plants affected by mold.&lt;ref name="Kuchta 1647–1653"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pantano|first=Flaminia|last2=Tittarelli|first2=Roberta|last3=Mannocchi|first3=Giulio|last4=Zaami|first4=Simona|last5=Ricci|first5=Serafino|last6=Giorgetti|first6=Raffaele|last7=Terranova|first7=Daniela|last8=Busardò|first8=Francesco P.|last9=Marinelli|first9=Enrico|date=2016-04-16|title=Hepatotoxicity Induced by "the 3Ks": Kava, Kratom and Khat|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=17|issue=4|doi=10.3390/ijms17040580|issn=1422-0067|pmc=4849036|pmid=27092496|pages=580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bjcp"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Sarris|first2=Jerome|last3=Schweitzer|first3=Isaac|year=2012|title=Kava hepatotoxicity in traditional and modern use: The presumed Pacific kava paradox hypothesis revisited|journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|volume=73|issue=2|pages=170–4|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2011.04070.x|pmc=3269575|pmid=21801196|last1=Teschke|first1=Rolf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, aside from "the small number of cases of kava hepatotoxicity [that might have been] due to an idiosyncratic reaction of the metabolic type",&lt;ref name=bjcp/&gt; "liver injury by kava is basically a preventable disease".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In order to minimize or eliminate the risk of liver injury, only high-quality plant material should be used in the preparation of kava supplements or kava beverages.&lt;ref name=teschke2011/&gt; In particular, the use of the so-called "two-day" (known also as "tudei", "isa", "palisi") and wild (''[[Piper wichmanii]]'') cultivars traditionally not consumed should be avoided.&lt;ref name="Kuchta 1647–1653" /&gt; The use of these cultivars in the manufacturing of kava-based pharmaceutical products is undesirable due to their very different [[phytochemistry]] and relatively high concentrations of potentially harmful compounds (flavokavains).&lt;ref name="Kuchta 1647–1653" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lebot 554–560"/&gt; While other ("noble") cultivars also contain these compounds, toxicity seems to be triggered only at relatively high concentrations, too high to be of relevance with the use of noble kava or its corresponding extract preparations".&lt;ref name="Kuchta 1647–1653" /&gt; Such cultivars mainly grow in Vanuatu which outlawed their exports in 2004.&lt;ref name="Teschke 2503–2516" /&gt;

=== Other adverse reactions ===
Adverse reactions may result from the poor quality of kava raw material used in the manufacturing of various kava products.&lt;ref name=teschke2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=drugs/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teschke|first=Rolf|last2=Schulze|first2=Johannes|title=Risk of Kava Hepatotoxicity and the FDA Consumer Advisory|url=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/186893|journal=JAMA|year=2010|volume=304|issue=19|pages=2174–5|doi=10.1001/jama.2010.1689|pmid=21081732|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="teschke16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teschke|first=Rolf|last2=Sarris|first2=Jerome|last3=Glass|first3=Xaver|last4=Schulze|first4=Johannes|year=2016|title=Kava, the anxiolytic herb: back to basics to prevent liver injury?|journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|volume=71|issue=3|pages=445–448|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2010.03775.x|issn=0306-5251|pmc=3045554|pmid=21284704}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the potential for hepatotoxicity, adverse reactions from chronic use may include cognitive or visual impairment, rashes or dermatitis, seizures, weight loss, and malnutrition, but there is only limited high-quality research on these possible effects.&lt;ref name=fao-who/&gt;&lt;ref name=drugs/&gt;

On the basis of research findings and long history of safe use across the South Pacific, experts recommend using water-based extractions of high-quality peeled rhizome and roots of the noble kava cultivars to minimize the potential of adverse reactions to chronic use.&lt;ref name=fao-who/&gt;&lt;ref name=teschke2011/&gt;

=== Potential interactions ===
Several adverse interactions with drugs have been documented, both prescription and nonprescription&amp;nbsp;– including, but not limited to, [[anticonvulsants]], alcohol, [[anxiolytics]] (CNS depressants such as [[benzodiazepines]]), [[antipsychotics]], [[levodopa]], diuretics, and drugs metabolized by CYP450 in the liver.&lt;ref name=drugs/&gt;

A few notable potential drug interactions are, but are not limited to:
* Alcohol: It has been reported that combined use of alcohol and kava extract can have additive sedative effects.&lt;ref name=drugs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cairney S. |author2=Maruff P. |author3=Clough A.

* Anxiolytics (CNS depressants such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates): Kava may have potential additive CNS depressant effects (such as sedation and anxiolytic effects) with [[benzodiazepines]] and [[barbiturates]].&lt;ref name=drugs/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* [[Dopamine]] [[agonist]] - [[levodopa]]: One of levodopa’s chronic side effects that Parkinson’s patients experience is the "on-off phenomenon" of motor fluctuations where there will be periods of oscillations between "on" where the patient experiences symptomatic relief and "off" where the therapeutic effect wears off early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lees AJ|title=The on-off phenomenon|journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry|year=1989|volume=Suppl|issue=9|pages=29–37|pmid=1033307|doi=10.1136/jnnp.52.suppl.29}}&lt;/ref&gt; When taking levodopa and kava together, it has been shown that there is an increased frequency of this "on-off phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;Izzo AA, Ernst E.

=== Kava dermopathy ===
Long term and heavy kava consumption is associated with a fully reversible [[cutaneous condition|skin condition]] known as "kava dermopathy" or ''kani kani'' (in Fiji) characterised by dry and scaly skin covering the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and back.&lt;ref name=drugs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruze|first=P.|date=1990-06-16|title=Originally published as Volume 1, Issue 8703Kava-induced dermopathy: a niacin deficiency?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/014067369091458M|journal=The Lancet|volume=335|issue=8703|pages=1442–1445|doi=10.1016/0140-6736(90)91458-M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norton 89–97"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norton|first=Scott A.|last2=Ruze|first2=Patricia|date=1994-07-01|title=Kava dermopathy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962294701423|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|volume=31|issue=1|pages=89–97|doi=10.1016/S0190-9622(94)70142-3|pmid=8021378}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first symptom to appear is usually dry, peeling skin; some Pacific Islanders purposely consume large quantities of Kava for several weeks in order to get the peeling effect, resulting in a layer of new skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kava Side Effects|url=http://www.kavalibrary.com/side-effects.html|website=The Kava Library|accessdate=8 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These effects appeared at consumption levels between 31-440 grams a week of kava powder. Despite numerous studies, the mechanism that causes kava dermopathy is poorly understood "but may relate to interference with cholesterol metabolism".&lt;ref name="Norton 89–97" /&gt; The condition is easily treatable with abstinence or lowering of kava intake as the skin appears to be returning to its normal state within a couple of weeks of reduced or no kava use.&lt;ref name="Norton 89–97" /&gt; Kava dermopathy should not be confused with rare instances of allergic reactions to kava that are usually characterised by itchy rash or puffy face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019096229870547X|title=Sebotropic drug reaction resulting from kava-kava extract therapy: A new entity?|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|volume=38|issue=1|pages=104–6|doi=10.1016/S0190-9622(98)70547-X|pmid=9448214|access-date=2016-10-24|year=1998|last1=Jappe|first1=Uta|last2=Franke|first2=Ingolf|last3=Reinhold|first3=Dirk|last4=Gollnick|first4=Harald P.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Kava is under preliminary research for its potential [[psychoactive]]&lt;ref name=pmid21073405/&gt; &amp;ndash; primarily [[anxiolytic]] &amp;ndash; sleep-inducing, and sleep-enhancing properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wheatley|first=David|date=2001-06-01|title=Stress-induced insomnia treated with kava and valerian: singly and in combination|journal=Human Psychopharmacology|volume=16|issue=4|pages=353–356|doi=10.1002/hup.299|issn=1099-1077|pmid=12404572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary [[randomised controlled trial|randomized controlled trials]] in [[anxiety disorder]]s indicate a higher rate of improvement in anxiety symptoms after kava treatment, relative to placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarris|first=Jerome|last2=Stough|first2=Con|last3=Bousman|first3=Chad|last4=Wahid|first4=Zahra|last5=Murray|first5=Greg|last6=Teschke|first6=Rolf|last7=Dowell|first7=Ashley|last8=Ng|first8=Chee|last9=Schweitzer|first9=Isaac|date=2013-10-01|title=Kava in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology|language=en|volume=33|issue=5|pages=643–48|doi=10.1097/JCP.0b013e318291be67|pmid=23635869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional medicine==
[[File:Yaqona-bundle-Fiji-2010.jpg|thumb|A traditional Fijian yaqona bundle of roots]]

Over centuries, kava has been used in the [[traditional medicine]] of the South [[Pacific Islands]] for [[central nervous system]] and peripheral effects.&lt;ref name="Showman 56–67"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Showman|first=Angelique F.|last2=Baker|first2=Jonathan D.|last3=Linares|first3=Christina|last4=Naeole|first4=Chrystie K.|last5=Borris|first5=Robert|last6=Johnston|first6=Edward|last7=Konanui|first7=Jerry|last8=Turner|first8=Helen|date=2015-01-01|title=Contemporary Pacific and Western perspectives on 'awa (Piper methysticum) toxicology|journal=Fitoterapia|volume=100|pages=56–67|doi=10.1016/j.fitote.2014.11.012|issn=1873-6971|pmid=25464054}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted in one literature review: "Peripherally, kava is indicated in traditional Pacific medicine for urogenital conditions ([[gonorrhea]] infections, chronic [[Urinary tract infection|cystitis]], difficulty urinating), reproductive and women's health (...), gastrointestinal upsets, respiratory ailments ([[asthma]], coughs, and [[tuberculosis]]), skin diseases and topical wounds, and as an [[analgesic]], with significant subtlety and nuance attending the precise strain, plant component (leaf, stem, root) and preparative method to be used".&lt;ref name="Showman 56–67"/&gt;

==Regulation==
Kava remains legal in most countries. Regulations often treat it as a food or [[dietary supplement]].

===Australia===
In Australia, the supply of kava is regulated through the National Code of Kava Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2009C01242|title=Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code - Standard 2.6.3 - Kava|publisher=Federal Register of Legislation|accessdate=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travellers to Australia are allowed to bring up to 2&amp;nbsp;kg of kava in their baggage, provided they are at least 18 years old, and the kava is in root or dried form. Commercial import of larger quantities is allowed, under licence for medical or scientific purposes. These restrictions were introduced in 2007 after concern about abuse of kava in indigenous communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tga.gov.au/restrictions-import-kava-australia|title=Restrictions on the import of kava to Australia|date=14 April 2015|website=Therapeutic Goods Administration, Department of Health, Australian Government|accessdate=22 October 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian [[Therapeutic Goods Administration]] has recommended no more than 250&amp;nbsp;mg of kavalactones be taken in a 24‑hour period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tga.gov.au/cm/kavafs0504.htm | accessdate=10 July 2006 | title=Kava fact sheet | publisher=Therapeutic Goods Administration, Government of Australia | date=April 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720200953/http://www.tga.gov.au/cm/kavafs0504.htm | archivedate=20 July 2006 | df=dmy-all }} ([http://www.tga.gov.au/cm/kavafs0504.pdf Download PDF 44KB] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820014802/http://www.tga.gov.au/cm/kavafs0504.pdf |date=20 August 2006 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Kava possession is limited to 2&amp;nbsp;kg per adult in the [[Northern Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nt.gov.au/law/crime/kava|title=Kava|publisher=Northern Territory Government|date=12 December 2016|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), Sydney|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2015/02/18/islanders-shocked-australia-moves-ban-kava|title=Islanders shocked as Australia moves to ban kava|date=10 July 2015|author=Armbruster, Stefan|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it was banned in [[Western Australia]] previously in the 2000s, the Western Australian Health Department announced lifting of its ban in February 2017, bringing Western Australia "into line with other States" where it has always remained legal, albeit closely regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thewest.com.au/news/health/kava-legal-in-relaxation-of-was-drug-laws-ng-b88384684z|title=Kava legal in WA, marketed at troubled sleepers|date=2017-02-13|newspaper=The West Australian|access-date=2017-02-13|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Following the discussions on the safety of certain pharmaceutical products derived from kava and sold in Germany, in 2002 the EU imposed a temporary ban on imports of kava-based pharmaceutical products. The sale of kava plant became regulated in [[Switzerland]], [[France]], and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=C.I.J.M.

In Germany, kava-based pharmaceutical preparations are currently prescription drugs. Furthermore, patient and professional information brochures have been redesigned to warn about potential side effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pharmazeutische-zeitung.de/index.php?id=57419Kava-Kava, Comeback unter strengen Auflagen](in German).

Until August 2018, Poland was the only EU country with an "outright ban on kava" and where the mere possession of kava was prohibited and may have resulted in a prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dailypost.vu/news/kava-banned-in-poland/article_845575d3-6dd0-5c03-a1c4-e0720c868a7a.html|title=KAVA BANNED IN POLAND|last=Garae|first=Len|work=Vanuatu Daily Post|access-date=2018-09-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the new legislation, kava is no longer listed among prohibited substances and it is therefore legal to possess and consume the plant,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20180001591|title=Rozporządzenie Ministra Zdrowia z dnia 17 sierpnia 2018 r. w sprawie wykazu substancji psychotropowych, środków odurzających oraz nowych substancji psychoaktywnych|website=prawo.sejm.gov.pl|language=en|access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it remains illegal to sell or import commercially for the purpose of human consumption.

===New Zealand===
When used traditionally kava is regulated as a food under the Food Standards Code. Kava can also be used as a herbal remedy. When used in this way kava is currently regulated by the Dietary Supplements Regulations. Only traditionally consumed forms and parts of the kava plant (i.e. pure roots of the kava plant and water extractions prepared from these roots) can legally be sold as food or dietary supplements in New Zealand. The sale of never traditionally consumed above-ground parts of the plant (unlike the roots of the plant, the aerial parts contain very small amounts of kavalactones and instead contain a mildly toxic alkaloid pipermethysticin&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;) and non-water based extract (such as CO2, acetonic or ethanol extractions) is prohibited for the purpose of human consumption (but can be sold as an ingredient in cosmetics or other products not intended for human consumption).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/dunne-kava-unaffected-psychoactive-substances-bill|title=Dunne: Kava unaffected by Psychoactive Substances Bill|website=The Beehive|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gazette.govt.nz/notice/id/2015-gs1906|title=Standard 2.6.3 – Kava – Food Standards (Proposal P1025 – Code Revision) Variation—Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code – Amendment No. 154 - 2015-gs1906 - New Zealand Gazette|website=gazette.govt.nz|access-date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Health Canada]] issued an order prohibiting the sale of any product containing kava.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Marketed Health Products Directorate Heath Products and Foods Branch|journal=Canadian Adverse Reaction Newsletter|volume=12|issue=4|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/medeff/bulletin/carn-bcei_v12n4-eng.php|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the restrictions on kava were lifted in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/applic-demande/guide-ld/newdrug-drognouv/ndrugs_ndrogue-eng.php |title=Listing of Drugs Currently Regulated as New Drugs (The New Drugs List) |date=26 May 2016 |website=www.hc-sc.gc.ca |publisher=Health Canada |accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health Canada lists 5 kava ingredients as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthlinkbc.ca/healthtopics/content.asp?hwid=tn7356spec|title=Kava|publisher=HealthLink BC, Government of British Columbia|date=22 May 2015|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webprod.hc-sc.gc.ca/nhpid-bdipsn/ingredsReq.do?srchRchTxt=kava&amp;srchRchRole=-1&amp;mthd=Search&amp;lang=eng|title=Ingredients - Kava|publisher=Health Canada|date=2017|accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the US [[regulation of food and dietary supplements by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] issued a Consumer Advisory: "Kava-Containing Dietary Supplements May be Associated With Severe Liver Injury." No legal action was taken and this advisory has since been archived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/ucm085482.htm|title=Consumer Advisory: Kava-Containing Dietary Supplements May be Associated With Severe Liver Injury|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|date=25 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vanuatu===
The Pacific island-state of Vanuatu has passed legislation to regulate the quality of its kava exports. Vanuatu prohibits the export or consumption of non-noble kava varieties or the parts of the plant that are unsuitable for consumption (such as leaves and stems).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faolex.fao.org/docs/html/van38473.htm|title=Vanuatu - Legislation - Kava Act 2002|website=faolex.fao.org|access-date=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Lead poisoning''' is a type of [[metal poisoning]] caused by [[lead]] in the body.&lt;ref name=WHO2016/&gt; The [[brain]] is the most sensitive.&lt;ref name=WHO2016/&gt; Symptoms may include abdominal pain, [[constipation]], headaches, irritability, memory problems, [[infertility|inability to have children]], and [[paresthesia|tingling]] in the hands and feet.&lt;ref name=CDC2013Sym&gt;{{cite web|title=Lead Information for Workers|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/lead/health.html|website=CDC|accessdate=14 October 2016|date=30 September 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018215410/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/lead/health.html|archivedate=18 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It causes almost 10% of [[intellectual disability]] of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems.&lt;ref name=WHO2016/&gt; Some of the effects are permanent.&lt;ref name=WHO2016/&gt; In severe cases [[anemia]], [[seizures]], [[coma]], or [[death]] may occur.&lt;ref name=CDC2013Sym/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO2016/&gt;

&lt;!-- Exposure and diagnosis --&gt;
Exposure to lead can occur by contaminated air, water, dust, food, or consumer products.&lt;ref name=WHO2016/&gt; Children are at greater risk as they are more likely to put objects in their mouth such as those that contain [[lead paint]] and absorb a greater proportion of the lead that they eat.&lt;ref name=WHO2016/&gt; Exposure at work is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults with certain occupations at particular risk.&lt;ref name=Gra2007/&gt; Diagnosis is typically by measurement of the [[blood lead level]].&lt;ref name=WHO2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Lead poisoning and health|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs379/en/|website=WHO|accessdate=14 October 2016|date=September 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018024720/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs379/en/|archivedate=18 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Centers for Disease Control]] (US) has set the upper limit for blood lead for adults at 10&amp;nbsp;µg/dl (10&amp;nbsp;µg/100 g) and for children at 5&amp;nbsp;µg/dl.&lt;ref name=CDC2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Advisory Committee On Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention (ACCLPP)|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/ACCLPP/acclpp_main.htm|publisher=CDC|accessdate=18 May 2012|date=May 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504235623/http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/ACCLPP/acclpp_main.htm|archivedate=4 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Code of Federal Regulations of the United States of America|date=2005|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sb06AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA116|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105194927/https://books.google.com/books?id=sb06AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA116|archivedate=2017-11-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elevated lead may also be detected by changes in [[red blood cell]]s or dense lines in the bones of children as seen on [[X-ray]].&lt;ref name=Dap2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dapul|first1=H|last2=Laraque|first2=D|title=Lead poisoning in children.|journal=Advances in Pediatrics|date=August 2014|volume=61|issue=1|pages=313–33|pmid=25037135|doi=10.1016/j.yapd.2014.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment  --&gt;
Lead poisoning is preventable.&lt;ref name=WHO2016/&gt; This includes individual efforts such as removing lead-containing items from the home,&lt;ref name=Need2004/&gt; workplace efforts such as improved ventilation and monitoring,&lt;ref name=CDC2016Prev&gt;{{cite web|title=Lead Information for Employers|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/lead/prevention.html|website=CDC|accessdate=14 October 2016|date=30 September 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018210747/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/lead/prevention.html|archivedate=18 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nationwide policies such as laws that ban lead in products such as paint and gasoline, reduce allowable levels in water or soil, and provide for cleanup of contaminated soil.&lt;ref name=WHO2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dap2014/&gt; The major treatments are removal of the source of lead and the use of medications that bind lead so it can be [[excretion|eliminated from the body]], known as [[chelation therapy]].&lt;ref name=Dap2014/&gt; Chelation therapy in children is recommended when blood levels are greater than 40–45&amp;nbsp;µg/dl.&lt;ref name=Dap2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Do Parents Need to Know to Protect Their Children?|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/acclpp/blood_lead_levels.htm|website=CDC|accessdate=14 October 2016|date=30 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009233521/http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/acclpp/blood_lead_levels.htm|archivedate=9 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medications used include [[dimercaprol]], [[edetate calcium disodium]], and [[succimer]].&lt;ref name=Gra2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gracia|first1=RC|last2=Snodgrass|first2=WR|title=Lead toxicity and chelation therapy.|journal=American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy|date=1 January 2007|volume=64|issue=1|pages=45–53|pmid=17189579|doi=10.2146/ajhp060175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;
In 2016 lead is believed to have resulted in 540,000 deaths.&lt;ref name=WHO2016/&gt; It occurs most commonly in the [[developing world]].&lt;ref name=WHO2016/&gt; Those who are poor are at greater risk.&lt;ref name=WHO2016/&gt; Lead is believed to result in 0.6% of the world's [[disease burden]].&lt;ref name=Need2004/&gt; People have been mining and using lead for thousands of years.&lt;ref name=Dap2014/&gt; Descriptions of lead poisoning date to at least 2000 BC,&lt;ref name=Dap2014/&gt; while efforts to limit lead's use date back to at least the 16th century.&lt;ref name=Need2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Needleman|first1=H|title=Lead poisoning|journal=Annual Review of Medicine|volume=55|pages=209–22|year=2004|pmid=14746518|doi=10.1146/annurev.med.55.091902.103653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns for low levels of exposure begin in the 1970s with there being no safe threshold for lead exposure.&lt;ref name=WHO2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dap2014/&gt;

==Classification==
&lt;!-- DEFINITIONS --&gt;
Classically, "lead poisoning" or "lead intoxication" has been defined as exposure to high levels of lead typically associated with severe health effects.&lt;ref name="Grant09-785"&gt;[[#CITEREFGrant09|Grant (2009)]] p. 785&lt;/ref&gt; Poisoning is a pattern of symptoms that occur with toxic effects from mid to high levels of exposure; toxicity is a wider spectrum of effects, including [[subclinical]] ones (those that do not cause symptoms).&lt;ref name="Guidotti07-PedClin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guidotti|first1=TL|last2=Ragain|first2=L|title=Protecting children from toxic exposure: three strategies|journal=Pediatric Clinics of North America|volume=54|issue=2|pages=227–35, vii|year=2007|pmid=17448358|doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2007.02.002|citeseerx=10.1.1.533.907}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, professionals often use "lead poisoning" and "lead toxicity" interchangeably, and official sources do not always restrict the use of "lead poisoning" to refer only to symptomatic effects of lead.&lt;ref name="Guidotti07-PedClin"/&gt;

The amount of lead in the blood and tissues, as well as the time course of exposure, determine toxicity.&lt;ref name="Pearson03"/&gt;
&lt;!-- ACUTE VS. CHRONIC --&gt;
Lead poisoning may be acute (from intense exposure of short duration) or chronic (from repeat low-level exposure over a prolonged period), but the latter is much more common.&lt;ref name="Trevor07-479"&gt;[[#CITEREFTrevor07|Trevor, Katzung, Masters (2007)]] p. 479&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- BLOOD LEVELS --&gt;
Diagnosis and treatment of lead exposure are based on blood lead level (the amount of lead in the blood), measured in [[microgram]]s of lead per [[deciliter]] of blood (μg/dL). Urine lead levels may be used as well, though less commonly. In cases of chronic exposure lead often sequesters in the highest concentrations first in the bones, then in the kidneys. If a provider is performing a provocative excretion test, or "chelation challenge", a measurement obtained from urine rather than blood is likely to provide a more accurate representation of total lead burden to a skilled interpreter.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;Lowry, Jennifer A. (2010) [http://www.who.int/selection_medicines/committees/expert/18/applications/4_2_LeadOralChelators.pdf ORAL CHELATION THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH LEAD POISONING] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126141333/http://www.who.int/selection_medicines/committees/expert/18/applications/4_2_LeadOralChelators.pdf |date=2016-01-26 }}. ''WHO''&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the [[World Health Organization]] state that a blood lead level of 10&amp;nbsp;μg/dL or above is a cause for concern; however, lead may impair development and have harmful health effects even at lower levels, and there is no known safe exposure level.&lt;ref name="Rossi09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbosa"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbosa Jr|first1=F|last2=Tanus-Santos|first2=JE|last3=Gerlach|first3=RF|last4=Parsons|first4=PJ|title=A Critical Review of Biomarkers Used for Monitoring Human Exposure to Lead: Advantages, Limitations, and Future Needs|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=113|issue=12|pages=1669–74|year=2005|pmid=16330345|pmc=1314903|doi=10.1289/ehp.7917}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities such as the American Academy of Pediatrics define lead poisoning as blood lead levels higher than 10&amp;nbsp;μg/dL.&lt;ref name="Ragan09-JAAPA"/&gt;

&lt;!-- ORGANIC VS. INORGANIC --&gt;
Lead forms a variety of compounds and exists in the environment in various forms.&lt;ref name="Grant09-761"&gt;[[#CITEREFGrant09|Grant (2009)]] p. 761&lt;/ref&gt; Features of poisoning differ depending on whether the agent is an [[organic compound]] (one that contains carbon), or an [[inorganic]] one.&lt;ref name="Katzung07-948"/&gt; Organic lead poisoning is now very rare, because countries across the world have phased out the use of organic [[gasoline#Lead|lead compounds as gasoline additives]], but such compounds are still used in industrial settings.&lt;ref name="Katzung07-948"/&gt; Organic lead compounds, which cross the skin and respiratory tract easily, affect the [[central nervous system]] predominantly.&lt;ref name="Katzung07-948"/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Symptoms of lead poisoning (raster).png|thumb|upright=1.3|Symptoms of lead poisoning.]]
&lt;!-- ABOUT S/S --&gt;
Lead poisoning can cause a variety of [[symptom]]s and [[medical sign|signs]] which vary depending on the individual and the duration of lead exposure.&lt;ref name="Karri08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kosnett05-825"/&gt; Symptoms are nonspecific and may be subtle, and someone with elevated lead levels may have no symptoms.&lt;ref name="Mycyk05-463"/&gt; Symptoms usually develop over weeks to months as lead builds up in the body during a chronic exposure, but acute symptoms from brief, intense exposures also occur.&lt;ref name="Dart041426"/&gt;
&lt;!-- ORGANIC LEAD --&gt;
Symptoms from exposure to organic lead, which is probably more toxic than inorganic lead due to its lipid solubility, occur rapidly.&lt;ref name="Timbrell08"&gt;{{cite book |title= Principles of Biochemical Toxicology |edition=4th |chapter=Biochemical mechanisms of toxicity: Specific examples |editor= Timbrell, J.A. |year= 2008 |publisher=Informa Health Care |isbn= 978-0-8493-7302-2|ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poisoning by organic lead compounds has symptoms predominantly in the central nervous system, such as [[insomnia]], [[delirium]], [[cognitive deficit]]s, [[tremor]], hallucinations, and convulsions.&lt;ref name="Katzung07-948"/&gt;

&lt;!--
CHILDREN V. ADULTS--&gt;
Symptoms may be different in adults and children; the main symptoms in adults are headache, [[abdominal pain]], [[memory loss]], [[kidney failure]], male reproductive problems, and weakness, pain, or tingling in the extremities.&lt;ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pearce|first1=JM|title=Burton's line in lead poisoning|journal=European Neurology|volume=57|issue=2|pages=118–9|year=2007|pmid=17179719|doi=10.1159/000098100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early symptoms of lead poisoning in adults are commonly nonspecific and include depression, loss of appetite, intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and [[myalgia|muscle pain]].&lt;ref name="Merrill07"/&gt; Other early signs in adults include [[malaise]], fatigue, decreased [[libido]], and problems with sleep.&lt;ref name="Karri08"/&gt; An unusual taste in the mouth and personality changes are also early signs.&lt;ref name="Patrick06"/&gt;

In adults, symptoms can occur at levels above 40&amp;nbsp;μg/dL, but are more likely to occur only above 50–60&amp;nbsp;μg/dL.&lt;ref name="Karri08"/&gt; Symptoms begin to appear in children generally at around 60&amp;nbsp;μg/dL.&lt;ref name=Need2004/&gt; However, the lead levels at which symptoms appear vary widely depending on unknown characteristics of each individual.&lt;ref name="Bellinger04-Pedi"/&gt; At blood lead levels between 25 and 60&amp;nbsp;μg/dL, [[neuropsychiatric]] effects such as delayed [[reaction time]]s, irritability, and difficulty concentrating, as well as slowed [[motor nerve]] conduction and headache can occur.&lt;ref name="Kosnett06-240"&gt;[[#CITEREFKosnett06Pois|Kosnett (2006)]] p.240&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anemia]] may appear at blood lead levels higher than 50&amp;nbsp;μg/dL.&lt;ref name="Merrill07"/&gt; In adults, abdominal [[colic]], involving [[Paroxysmal attack|paroxysm]]s of pain, may appear at blood lead levels greater than 80&amp;nbsp;μg/dL.&lt;ref name="Kosnett05-825"&gt;[[#CITEREFKosnett05|Kosnett (2005)]] p. 825&lt;/ref&gt; Signs that occur in adults at blood lead levels exceeding 100&amp;nbsp;μg/dL include [[wrist drop]] and [[foot drop]], &lt;!-- because of neuropathy --&gt; and signs of [[encephalopathy]] (a condition characterized by [[cerebral edema|brain swelling]]), such as those that accompany increased [[intracranial pressure|pressure within the skull]], [[delirium]], coma, [[seizures]], and [[headache]].&lt;ref name="Henretig061314"&gt;[[#CITEREFHenretig06|Henretig (2006)]] p. 1314&lt;/ref&gt; In children, signs of encephalopathy such as bizarre behavior, discoordination, and apathy occur at lead levels exceeding 70&amp;nbsp;μg/dL.&lt;ref name="Henretig061314"/&gt; For both adults and children, it is rare to be asymptomatic if blood lead levels exceed 100&amp;nbsp;μg/dL.&lt;ref name="Kosnett05-825"/&gt;

===Acute poisoning===
In acute poisoning, typical neurological signs are pain, muscle weakness, [[paresthesia|numbness and tingling]], and, rarely, symptoms associated with [[encephalitis|inflammation of the brain]].&lt;ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"/&gt; Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are other acute symptoms.&lt;ref name="Brunton07-31"/&gt; Lead's effects on the mouth include [[astringent|astringency]] and a metallic taste.&lt;ref name="Brunton07-31"/&gt; [[Gastrointestinal problem]]s, such as [[constipation]], [[diarrhea]], [[poor appetite]], or [[weight loss]], are common in acute poisoning. Absorption of large amounts of lead over a short time can cause [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] (insufficient fluid in the [[circulatory system]]) due to loss of water from the gastrointestinal tract.&lt;ref name="Brunton07-31"/&gt; [[Hemolysis]] (the rupture of [[red blood cells]]) due to acute poisoning can cause [[anemia]] and [[hemoglobinuria|hemoglobin in the urine]].&lt;ref name="Brunton07-31"/&gt; Damage to kidneys can cause changes in urination such as [[oliguria|decreased urine output]].&lt;ref name="Brunton07-31"/&gt; People who survive acute poisoning often go on to display symptoms of chronic poisoning.&lt;ref name="Brunton07-31"/&gt;

===Chronic poisoning===
Chronic poisoning usually presents with symptoms affecting multiple systems,&lt;ref name="Katzung07-948"/&gt; but is associated with three main types of symptoms: [[gastrointestinal]], [[neuromuscular]], and [[neurological]].&lt;ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"/&gt; [[Central nervous system]] and neuromuscular symptoms usually result from intense exposure, while gastrointestinal symptoms usually result from exposure over longer periods.&lt;ref name="Brunton07-31"/&gt; Signs of chronic exposure include loss of [[short-term memory]] or concentration, depression, nausea, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and numbness and tingling in the extremities.&lt;ref name="Patrick06"/&gt;{{ums|date=December 2017}} Fatigue, problems with sleep, headaches, stupor, slurred speech, and anemia are also found in chronic lead poisoning.&lt;ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"/&gt; A "lead hue" of the skin with [[pallor]] and/or [[lividity]] is another feature&lt;!--of chronic lead poisoning--&gt;.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005).

====Kidneys====
Kidney damage occurs with exposure to high levels of lead, and evidence suggests that lower levels can damage kidneys as well.&lt;ref name="Grant09-789"&gt;[[#CITEREFGrant09|Grant (2009)]] p. 789&lt;/ref&gt; The toxic effect of lead causes [[nephropathy]] and may cause [[Fanconi syndrome]], in which the [[proximal tubule|proximal tubular]] function of the kidney is impaired.&lt;ref name="Rubin08-267"&gt;[[#CITEREFRubin08|Rubin, Strayer (2008)]] p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term exposure at levels lower than those that cause lead nephropathy have also been reported as [[nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxic]] in patients from developed countries that had chronic kidney disease or were at risk because of hypertension or [[diabetes mellitus]].&lt;ref name="Ekong06KidneyInt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ekong|first1=EB|last2=Jaar|first2=BG|last3=Weaver|first3=VM|title=Lead-related nephrotoxicity: a review of the epidemiologic evidence|journal=Kidney International|volume=70|issue=12|pages=2074–84|year=2006|pmid=17063179|doi=10.1038/sj.ki.5001809}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
GOUT --&gt;Lead poisoning inhibits excretion of the waste product [[uric acid|urate]] and causes a predisposition for [[gout]], in which urate builds up.&lt;ref name="Wright83JReum"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=LF|last2=Saylor|first2=RP|last3=Cecere|first3=FA|title=Occult lead intoxication in patients with gout and kidney disease|journal=The Journal of Rheumatology|volume=11|issue=4|pages=517–20|year=1984|pmid=6434739}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8035397"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin JL, Huang PT |title=Body lead stores and urate excretion in men with chronic renal disease |journal=J.

====Cardiovascular system====
Evidence suggests lead exposure is associated with [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], and studies have also found connections between lead exposure and [[coronary artery|coronary]] [[heart disease]], [[heart rate variability]], and death from stroke, but this evidence is more limited.&lt;ref name="Navas-Acien06"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Navas-Acien|first1=A|last2=Guallar|first2=E|last3=Silbergeld|first3=EK|last4=Rothenberg|first4=SJ|title=Lead Exposure and Cardiovascular Disease—A Systematic Review|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=115|issue=3|pages=472–82|year=2007|pmid=17431501|pmc=1849948|doi=10.1289/ehp.9785}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who have been exposed to higher concentrations of lead may be at a higher risk for cardiac [[autonomic dysfunction]] on days when [[ozone]] and fine particles are higher.&lt;ref name="Park09Epidem"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=SK|last2=O'Neill|first2=MS|last3=Vokonas|first3=PS|last4=Sparrow|first4=D|last5=Wright|first5=RO|last6=Coull|first6=B|last7=Nie|first7=H|last8=Hu|first8=H|last9=Schwartz|first9=J| displayauthors = 8|title=Air Pollution and Heart Rate Variability: Effect Modification by Chronic Lead Exposure|journal=Epidemiology|volume=19|issue=1|pages=111–20|year=2008|pmid=18091001|pmc=2671065|doi=10.1097/EDE.0b013e31815c408a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reproductive system====
Lead affects both the male and female reproductive systems. In men, when blood lead levels exceed 40&amp;nbsp;μg/dL, [[sperm count]] is reduced and changes occur in volume of sperm, their [[motility]], and their [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]].&lt;ref name="Grant09-792"&gt;[[#CITEREFGrant09|Grant (2009)]] p. 792&lt;/ref&gt;
A pregnant woman's elevated blood lead level can lead to [[miscarriage]], [[Preterm birth|prematurity]], low [[birth weight]], and problems with development during childhood.&lt;ref name="Cleveland08"/&gt; Lead is able to pass through the [[placenta]] and into breast milk, and blood lead levels in mothers and infants are usually similar.&lt;ref name="Dart041426"/&gt; A fetus may be poisoned ''in utero'' if lead from the mother's bones is subsequently mobilized by the changes in metabolism due to pregnancy; increased calcium intake in pregnancy may help mitigate this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Bellinger05BirthDef"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellinger|first1=DC|title=Teratogen update: lead and pregnancy|journal=Birth Defects Research.

====Nervous system====

Lead affects the [[peripheral nervous system]] (especially [[motor nerve]]s) and the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Dart041426"/&gt; Peripheral nervous system effects are more prominent in adults and central nervous system effects are more prominent in children.&lt;ref name="Bellinger04-Pedi"/&gt; Lead causes the [[axon]]s of [[neuron|nerve cells]] to degenerate and lose their [[myelin]] coats.&lt;ref name="Dart041426"/&gt;

&lt;!-- COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE IN CHILDREN --&gt;Lead exposure in young children has been linked to [[learning disability|learning disabilities]],&lt;ref name="Meyer-IntJHyge"/&gt; and children with blood lead concentrations greater than 10&amp;nbsp;μg/dL are in danger of [[developmental disability|developmental disabilities]].&lt;ref name="Brunton07-31"/&gt; Increased blood lead level in children has been correlated with decreases in [[intelligence quotient|intelligence]], nonverbal reasoning, [[short-term memory]], attention, reading and arithmetic ability, [[fine motor skill]]s, [[emotional regulation]], and [[Social skill|social engagement]].&lt;ref name="Cleveland08"/&gt;

&lt;!-- LOW LEVELS --&gt;
The effect of lead on children's cognitive abilities takes place at very low levels.&lt;ref name="Lanphear05EnvironHealth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cleveland08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bellinger08"/&gt; There is apparently no lower threshold to the [[dose-response relationship]] (unlike other heavy metals such as [[mercury (element)|mercury]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Needleman|first1=HL|last2=Schell|first2=A|last3=Bellinger|first3=D|last4=Leviton|first4=A|last5=Allred|first5=EN|title=The long-term effects of exposure to low doses of lead in childhood.

&lt;!-- COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE IN ADULTS --&gt;
High blood lead levels in adults are also associated with decreases in cognitive performance and with psychiatric symptoms such as depression and anxiety.&lt;ref name="Shih07"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shih|first1=RA|last2=Hu|first2=H|last3=Weisskopf|first3=MG|last4=Schwartz|first4=BS|title=Cumulative Lead Dose and Cognitive Function in Adults: A Review of Studies That Measured Both Blood Lead and Bone Lead|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=115|issue=3|pages=483–92|year=2007|pmid=17431502|pmc=1849945|doi=10.1289/ehp.9786}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found in a large group of current and former inorganic lead workers in Korea that blood lead levels in the range of 20–50&amp;nbsp;μg/dL were correlated with neuro-cognitive defects.&lt;ref name="Kosnett07EnvironHealthPers"/&gt; Increases in blood lead levels from about 50 to about 100&amp;nbsp;μg/dL in adults have been found to be associated with persistent, and possibly permanent, impairment of central nervous system function.&lt;ref name="Grant09-789"/&gt;

===Occupational exposure===
[[File:Recycling lead in a lead-acid battery recovery facility.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A man in a hard hat with a clear face plate leans over a conveyor belt with a metal instrument. He is in a factory setting with heavy machinery in the background.|[[Battery recycling]] workers are at risk for lead exposure.&lt;ref name="Brodkin07-CMAJ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brodkin|first1=E|last2=Copes|first2=R|last3=Mattman|first3=A|last4=Kennedy|first4=J|last5=Kling|first5=R|last6=Yassi|first6=A|title=Lead and mercury exposures: interpretation and action|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal |volume=176|issue=1|pages=59–63|year=2007|pmid=17200393|pmc=1764574|doi=10.1503/cmaj.060790}}&lt;/ref&gt; This worker ladles molten lead into billets in a lead-acid battery recovery facility.]]

In adults, occupational exposure is the main cause of lead poisoning.&lt;ref name="Need2004" /&gt; People can be exposed when working in facilities that produce a variety of lead-containing products; these include [[radiation shield]]s, ammunition, certain surgical equipment, developing dental x-ray films prior to digital x-rays (each film packet had a lead liner to prevent the radiation from going through), fetal monitors, plumbing, circuit boards, jet engines, and ceramic glazes.&lt;ref name="Patrick06"/&gt;{{ums|date=December 2017}} In addition, lead miners and smelters, plumbers and fitters, auto mechanics, glass manufacturers, construction workers, battery manufacturers and recyclers, firing range instructors, and plastic manufacturers are at risk for lead exposure.&lt;ref name="Sanborn"/&gt; Other occupations that present lead exposure risks include welding, manufacture of rubber, printing, [[zinc]] and [[copper]] smelting, processing of [[ore]], combustion of [[solid waste]], and production of paints and pigments.&lt;ref name="Dart041424"&gt;[[#CITEREFDart04|Dart, Hurlbut, Boyer-Hassen (2004)]] p. 1424&lt;/ref&gt; Parents who are exposed to lead in the workplace can bring lead dust home on clothes or skin and expose their children.&lt;ref name="Dart041424"/&gt; Occupational exposure to lead increases the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]], in particular: [[stroke]], and [[high blood pressure]].&lt;ref name="SBU2017"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbu.se/en/publications/sbu-assesses/occupational-health-and-safety--chemical-exposure/|title=Occupational health and safety – chemical exposure|publisher=[[Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services]] (SBU)|date=2017-03-28|website=www.sbu.se|language=en|access-date=2017-06-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food ===
Lead may be found in food when food is grown in soil that is high in lead, airborne lead contaminates the crops, animals eat lead in their diet, or lead enters the food either from what it was stored or cooked in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Castellino|first1=Nicolo|last2=Sannolo|first2=Nicola|last3=Castellino|first3=Pietro|title=Inorganic Lead Exposure and Intoxications|date=1994|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780873719971|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=059oObc8X48C&amp;pg=PA86|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105194927/https://books.google.com/books?id=059oObc8X48C&amp;pg=PA86|archivedate=2017-11-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paint===
Some lead compounds are colorful and are used widely in paints,&lt;ref name="Henretig06"&gt;[[#CITEREFHenretig06|Henretig (2006)]] p. 1310&lt;/ref&gt; and lead paint is a major route of lead exposure in children.&lt;ref name="Gilbert06"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilbert|first1=SG|last2=Weiss|first2=B|title=A rationale for lowering the blood lead action level from 10 to 2 μg/dL|journal=Neurotoxicology|volume=27|issue=5|pages=693–701|year=2006|pmid=16889836|pmc=2212280|doi=10.1016/j.neuro.2006.06.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in 1998–2000 found that 38 million housing units in the US had lead-based paint, down from a 1990 estimate of 64 million.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The prevalence of lead-based paint hazards in U.S. housing|doi=10.1289/ehp.021100599|jstor=3455813|year=2002|last1=Jacobs|first1=David E.|last2=Clickner|first2=Robert P.|last3=Zhou|first3=Joey Y.|last4=Viet|first4=Susan M.|last5=Marker|first5=David A.|last6=Rogers|first6=John W.|last7=Zeldin|first7=Darryl C.|last8=Broene|first8=Pamela|last9=Friedman|first9=Warren| displayauthors = 8|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=110|issue=10|pages=A599–606|pmid=12361941|pmc=1241046}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deteriorating lead paint can produce dangerous lead levels in household dust and soil.&lt;ref name="Dart041423"&gt;[[#CITEREFDart04|Dart, Hurlbut, Boyer-Hassen (2004)]] p. 1423&lt;/ref&gt; Deteriorating lead paint and lead-containing household dust are the main causes of chronic lead poisoning.&lt;ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"/&gt; The lead breaks down into the dust and since children are more prone to crawling on the floor, it is easily ingested.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Many young children display [[Pica (disorder)|pica]], eating things that are not food. Even a small amount of a lead-containing product such as a paint chip or a sip of glaze can contain tens or hundreds of milligrams of lead.&lt;ref name="Kosnett06-241"/&gt; Eating chips of lead paint presents a particular hazard to children, generally producing more severe poisoning than occurs from dust.&lt;ref name="Chisolm04-222"/&gt; Because removing lead paint from dwellings, e.g. by sanding or torching creates lead-containing dust and fumes, it is generally safer to seal the lead paint under new paint (excepting moveable windows and doors, which create paint dust when operated).&lt;ref name="Salvato03"/&gt; Alternatively, special precautions must be taken if the lead paint is to be removed.&lt;ref name="Salvato03"&gt;[[#CITEREFSalvato03|Salvato (2003)]] p.116&lt;/ref&gt; In [[oil painting]] it was once common for colours such as yellow or white to be made with lead carbonate. [[Lead paint#Oil paints|Lead white]] oil colour was the main white of oil painters until superseded by compounds containing zinc or titanium in the mid-20th century. It is speculated that the painter [[Caravaggio]] and possibly [[Francisco Goya]] and [[Vincent van Gogh's health|Vincent Van Gogh]] had lead poisoning due to overexposure or carelessness when handling this colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jun/16/caravaggio-italy-remains-ravenna-art|title=The mystery of Caravaggio's death solved at last – painting killed him|author=Tom Kington|newspaper=the Guardian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825140508/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/jun/16/caravaggio-italy-remains-ravenna-art|archivedate=2013-08-25|df=|date=2010-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soil===
[[File:Gas pump lead warning.jpg|thumb|right|A lead warning on a fuel pump. [[Tetraethyllead]], which used to be added to automotive gasoline (and still is added to some [[avgas|aviation gasolines]]), contributed to soil contamination.|alt=a closeup of a red gasoline pump with a warning label that reads, "for use as a motor fuel only" (in larger writing) "contains lead" (in smaller writing) "(tetraethyl)"]]
Residual lead in soil contributes to lead exposure in urban areas.&lt;ref name="Guidotti07-PedClin"/&gt; It has been thought that the more polluted an area is with various contaminants, the more likely it is to contain lead. However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination in soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barltrop D, Strehlow CD, Thornton I, Webb JS |title=Absorption of lead from dust and soil |journal=Postgrad Med J |volume=51 |issue=601 |pages=801–4 |date=November 1975 |pmid=1208289 |pmc=2496115 |doi=10.1136/pgmj.51.601.801}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, [[tire balance#Environmental consequences|tire weights]], or [[pesticide]]s used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as [[foundry|foundries]] or smelters.&lt;ref name="Woolf07-PedClin"/&gt; Although leaded soil is less of a problem in countries that no longer have [[gasoline#Lead|leaded gasoline]], it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of [[urban agriculture]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Murphy, K. |date=May 13, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/garden/14lead.html?pagewanted=1&amp;hpw |title=For urban gardeners, lead is a concern |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=September 18, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503034153/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/garden/14lead.html?pagewanted=1&amp;hpw |archivedate=May 3, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard.&lt;ref name="Yu05-188"&gt;[[#CITEREFYu05|Yu (2005)]] p.188&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water===
Lead from the atmosphere or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water.&lt;ref name="Yu05"&gt;[[#CITEREFYu05|Yu (2005)]] p.187&lt;/ref&gt; It is also potentially in [[drinking water]], e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder.&lt;ref name="Chisolm04-222"&gt;[[#CITEREFChisolm04|Chisolm (2004)]] pp. 221–22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Menkes06-703"&gt;[[#CITEREFMenkes06|Menkes (2006)]] p.703&lt;/ref&gt; Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily, chemicals can be added to municipal water to increase the [[pH]] and thus reduce the [[Corrosion|corrosivity]] of the public [[water supply]].&lt;ref name="Chisolm04-222"/&gt; [[Chloramine]]s, which were adopted as a substitute for [[chlorine]] [[disinfectant]]s due to fewer health concerns, increase corrositivity.&lt;ref name="Maas2005" /&gt; In the US, 14–20% of total lead exposure is attributed to [[drinking water]].&lt;ref name="Maas2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maas|first1=RP|last2=Patch|first2=SC|last3=Morgan|first3=DM|last4=Pandolfo|first4=TJ|title=Reducing lead exposure from drinking water: recent history and current status |journal=Public Health Reports |volume=120|issue=3|pages=316–21|year=2005|pmid=16134575|pmc=1497727|doi=10.1177/003335490512000317}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a team of seven reporters from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' discovered [[Lead contamination in Washington, D.C. drinking water|high levels of lead in the drinking water in Washington, D.C.]] and won an award for [[investigative reporting]] for a series of articles about this contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alum Wins Investigative Reporting Award with Post Team |publisher=[[University of Maryland College Park|University of Maryland]] |date=February 25, 2005 |url=http://www.journalism.umd.edu/newrel/05newrel/scohen05.html |accessdate=2007-11-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060912005549/http://www.journalism.umd.edu/newrel/05newrel/scohen05.html |archivedate = September 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=HONORS |newspaper=The Washington Post|date=February 23, 2005 |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Flint water crisis]], a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source elevated lead levels in drinking water in domestic tap water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/15/this-is-how-toxic-flints-water-really-is/|title=This is how toxic Flint's water really is|author=Christopher Ingraham|date=15 January 2016|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/01/18/us/flint-michigan-water-crisis-five-things/index.html|title=Flint's water crisis: 5 things to know  - CNN.com|author=Eliott C.

Like [[Flint, Michigan]] and [[Washington, D.C.]], a similar fate had fallen on the State of Wisconsin, where they are estimated in having to replace up to 176,000 underground pipes due being made of lead. The city of [[Madison, Wisconsin]] addressed the issue and replaced all of their piping, but there are still others that have yet to follow suit. While there are chemical methods that could help reduce the amount of lead in the water distributed, the sure fix would be replacing the pipes completely. The problem with this solution is that while the state may replace the pipes below ground, it will be up to the homeowners to fix the pipes on their property which could end up being pretty pricey, about $3,000 on average pricey. Experts say that if the city were to replace their pipes and the citizens were to keep the old pipes located in their homes, there would be a potential for more lead to flow into their [[drinking water]]. The ultimate goal is for a total overhaul to take place, but this would require the citizens to buy into the pipe replacement. Such a move would allow the preservation of present health and secure greater health for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wpr.org/wisconsin-senate-unanimously-passes-bill-remove-lead-water-pipes | title=Wisconsin Senate Unanimously Passes Bill to Remove Lead Water Pipes| date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Collecting rainwater from roof runoff used as potable water may contain lead if there are lead contaminants on the roof or in the storage tank.&lt;ref name="Rossi09"/&gt; The Australian Drinking Water Guidelines allow a maximum of .01&amp;nbsp;mg/L lead in water.&lt;ref name="Rossi09"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rossi|first1=E|title=Low Level Environmental Lead Exposure – A Continuing Challenge|journal=The Clinical Biochemist.

===Lead-containing products===
Lead can be found in products such as [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]], an ancient cosmetic from the Middle East, South Asia, and parts of Africa that has many names; and from some toys.&lt;ref name="Guidotti07-PedClin"/&gt; [[2007 Chinese export recalls|In 2007, millions of toys made in China were recalled]] from multiple countries owing to safety hazards including lead paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/08/14/recall/index.html|title=Mattel CEO: 'Rigorous standards' after massive toy recall|publisher=CNN|date=November 15, 2007|accessdate=September 26, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825115546/http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/08/14/recall/index.html|archivedate=August 25, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vinyl mini-blinds, found especially in older housing, may contain lead.&lt;ref name="Ragan09-JAAPA"/&gt;&lt;!--
MEDICINE--&gt;
Lead is commonly incorporated into [[herbalism|herbal remedies]] such as Indian [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] preparations and remedies of Chinese origin.&lt;ref name="Rossi09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karri08"/&gt; There are also risks of elevated blood lead levels caused by folk remedies like ''azarcon'' and ''greta'', which each contain about 95% lead.&lt;ref name="Karri08"/&gt;

FOOD --&gt;
Ingestion of metallic lead, such as small lead fishing lures, increases blood lead levels and can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schep|first1=LJ|last2=Fountain|first2=JS|last3=Cox|first3=WM|last4=Pesola|first4=GR|title=Lead shot in the appendix|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=354|issue=16|pages=1757; author reply 1757|year=2006|pmid=16625019|doi=10.1056/NEJMc060133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madsen|first1=HH|last2=Skjdt|first2=T|last3=Jrgensen|first3=PJ|last4=Grandjean|first4=P|title=Blood lead levels in patients with lead shot retained in the appendix|journal=Acta Radiologica (Stockholm, Sweden : 1987)|volume=29|issue=6|pages=745–6|year=1988|pmid=3190952|doi=10.1080/02841858809171977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Durlach|first1=V|last2=Lisovoski|first2=F|last3=Gross|first3=A|last4=Ostermann|first4=G|last5=Leutenegger|first5=M|title=Appendicectomy in an unusual case of lead poisoning|journal=Lancet|volume=1|issue=8482|pages=687–8|year=1986|pmid=2869380|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(86)91769-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)|title=Death of a child after ingestion of a metallic charm—Minnesota, 2006|journal=MMWR.

Contact with ammunition is a source of lead exposure.

Because game animals can be shot using lead bullets, the potential for lead ingestion from game meat consumption has been studied clinically and epidemiologically. In a recent study conducted by the CDC,&lt;ref name=Iqbal2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iqbal|first1=Shahed|last2=Blumenthal|first2=Wendy|last3=Kennedy|first3=Chinaro|last4=Yip|first4=Fuyuen Y.|last5=Pickard|first5=Stephen|last6=Flanders|first6=W.

The study found that participants' age, sex, housing age, current hobbies with potential for lead exposure, and game consumption were all associated with blood lead level (PbB).

According to a study published in 2008, 1.1% of the 736 persons consuming wild game meat tested had PbB ≥5 μg/dl&lt;ref name="Iqbal"&gt;{{cite web|last=Iqbal |first=Shahed |title=Epi-AID Trip Report: Assessment of human health risk from consumption of wild game meat with possible lead contamination among the residents of the State of North Dakota |url=http://www.rmef.org/NR/rdonlyres/F07627AA-4D94-4CBC-B8FD-4F4F18401303/0/ND_report.pdf |work=Epi-AID Trip Report |publisher=National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Atlanta, Georgia, USA. |accessdate=March 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526095843/http://www.rmef.org/NR/rdonlyres/F07627AA-4D94-4CBC-B8FD-4F4F18401303/0/ND_report.pdf |archivedate=May 26, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015 The US HHS/CDC/NIOSH designated 5&amp;nbsp;µg/dL (five micrograms per deciliter) of whole blood, in a venous blood sample, as the reference blood lead level for adults. An elevated BLL is defined as a BLL ≥5&amp;nbsp;µg/dL. This case definition is used by the ABLES program, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), and CDC’s National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). Previously (i.e. from 2009 until November 2015), the case definition for an elevated BLL was a BLL ≥10&amp;nbsp;µg/dL.&lt;ref name="NIOSH2015"/&gt;

Copper-jacketed, lead-based bullets are more economical to produce and use than lead or any other material.  Alternative materials are available such as steel, copper, and tungsten, but alternatives are universally less effective and/or more expensive. However, the biggest impediment to using the vast majority of alternatives relates to current laws in the United States pertaining to armor-piercing rounds. Laws and regulations relating to armor-piercing ammunition expressly prohibit the use of brass, bronze, steel, tungsten, and nearly every metallic alternative in any bullet that can be shot by a handgun, which at this time is nearly every caliber smaller than 50BMG (including the popular .223 Remington, .308 Winchester and .30-06 to name just a few). Some lead-based bullets are resistant to fragmentation, offering hunters the ability to clean game animals with negligible risk of including lead fragments in prepared meat. Other bullets are prone to fragmentation and exacerbate the risk of lead ingestion from prepared meat. In practice, use of a non-fragmenting bullet and proper cleaning of the game animal's wound can eliminate the risk of lead ingestion from eating game;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; however, isolating such practice to experimentally determine its association with [[blood lead levels]] in study is difficult. [[Bismuth]] is an element used as a lead-replacement for shotgun pellets used in waterfowl hunting although shotshells made from bismuth are nearly ten times the cost of lead.

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Tera-ethyl-lead-chemical.png|right|thumb|[[Tetraethyllead]], still used as an additive in some fuels, can be absorbed through the skin.&lt;ref name="Patrick06"/&gt;{{ums|date=December 2017}} |alt=Two chemical diagrams of tetra-ethyl lead, or (CH3CH2)4Pb. On the left one, carbon and hydrogen are labeled, on the right they are shown as lines only.]]

&lt;!-- MEANS OF ABSORPTION --&gt;
Exposure occurs through [[inhalation]], [[ingestion]] or occasionally skin contact. Lead may be taken in through direct contact with mouth, nose, and eyes (mucous membranes), and through breaks in the skin. [[Tetraethyllead]], which was a gasoline additive and is still used in fuels such as aviation fuel, passes through the skin; however [[inorganic]] lead found in paint, food, and most lead-containing consumer products is only minimally absorbed through the skin.&lt;ref name="Patrick06"/&gt;{{ums|date=December 2017}} The main sources of absorption of inorganic lead are from ingestion and inhalation.&lt;ref name="Merrill07"&gt;[[#CITEREFMerrill07|Merrill, Morton, Soileau (2007)]] p. 860&lt;/ref&gt; In adults, about 35–40% of inhaled lead dust is deposited in the lungs, and about 95% of that goes into the bloodstream.&lt;ref name="Merrill07"/&gt; Of ingested inorganic lead, about 15% is absorbed, but this percentage is higher in children, pregnant women, and people with deficiencies of calcium, zinc, or iron.&lt;ref name="Karri08"/&gt; Infants may absorb about 50% of ingested lead, but little is known about absorption rates in children.&lt;ref name="Grant09-767"&gt;[[#CITEREFGrant09|Grant (2009)]] p. 767&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--
STORAGE --&gt;
The main body compartments that store lead are the blood, soft tissues, and bone; the half-life of lead in these tissues is measured in weeks for blood, months for soft tissues, and years for bone.&lt;ref name="Karri08"/&gt; Lead in the bones, teeth, hair, and nails is bound tightly and not available to other tissues, and is generally thought not to be harmful.&lt;ref name="Rubin08"&gt;[[#CITEREFRubin08|Rubin, Strayer (2008)]] p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more serious health effects on children.&lt;ref name="Barbosa"/&gt; The estimated half-life of lead in bone is 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;years, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone.&lt;ref name="Patrick06"/&gt;{{ums|date=December 2017}} The half-life of lead in the blood in men is about 40&amp;nbsp;days, but it may be longer in children and pregnant women, whose bones are undergoing [[bone remodeling|remodeling]], which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream.&lt;ref name="Barbosa"/&gt; Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone.&lt;ref name="Hu07"/&gt; Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs.&lt;ref name="Dart041426"&gt;[[#CITEREFDart04|Dart, Hurlbut, Boyer-Hassen (2004)]] p. 1426&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
EXCRETION
--&gt;Lead is removed from the body very slowly, mainly through urine.&lt;ref name="Pearson03"/&gt; Smaller amounts of lead are also eliminated through the feces, and very small amounts in hair, nails, and sweat.&lt;ref name="Kosnett06-238"/&gt;

===Enzymes===
[[File:196-Lead Poisoning-1qnv.tif|thumb|right|[[Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase|ALAD enzyme]] with lead bound ({{PDB|1QNV}})]]
The primary cause of lead's toxicity is its interference with a variety of enzymes because it binds to [[sulfhydryl group]]s found on many enzymes.&lt;ref name="Pearson03"/&gt; Part of lead's toxicity results from its ability to mimic other metals that take part in biological processes, which act as [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s in many enzymatic reactions, displacing them at the enzymes on which they act.&lt;ref name="Dart041426"/&gt; Lead is able to bind to and interact with many of the same [[enzyme]]s as these metals but, due to its differing chemistry, does not properly function as a cofactor, thus interfering with the enzyme's ability to catalyze its normal reaction or reactions. Among the essential metals with which lead interacts are calcium, iron, and zinc.&lt;ref name="Kosnett06-238"&gt;[[#CITEREFKosnett06Pois|Kosnett (2006)]] p.238&lt;/ref&gt;

The lead ion has a [[lone pair]] in its electronic structure, which can result in a distortion in the [[Coordination complex|coordination]] of [[ligand]]s, and in 2007 was hypothesized to be important in lead poisoning's effects on enzymes (see {{section link|Lone pair|Unusual lone pairs}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gourlaouen|first1=Christophe|last2=Parisel|first2=Olivier|title=Is an Electronic Shield at the Molecular Origin of Lead Poisoning?

&lt;!-- HEME --&gt;
One of the main causes for the pathology of lead is that it interferes with the activity of an essential enzyme called [[delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase]], or [[ALAD]] (see image of the enzyme structure), which is important in the biosynthesis of [[heme]], the cofactor found in [[hemoglobin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaffe|first1=E.

The brain is the organ most sensitive to lead exposure.&lt;ref name="Cecil08"/&gt; Lead is able to pass through the endothelial cells at the [[blood brain barrier]] because it can substitute for [[calcium|calcium ions]] and be uptaken by [[Plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase|calcium-ATPase pumps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lidsky|first=Theodore|title=Lead neurotoxicity in children: basic mechanisms and clinical correlates|journal=Brain|year=2003|doi=10.1093/brain/awg014|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/126/1/5.full|pmid=12477693|volume=126|issue=Pt 1|pages=5–19|display-authors=etal|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211225741/http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/126/1/5.full|archivedate=2016-02-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead poisoning interferes with the normal development of a child's brain and [[nervous system]]; therefore children are at greater risk of lead [[neurotoxicity]] than adults are.&lt;ref name="Sanders09"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanders|first1=T|last2=Liu|first2=Y|last3=Buchner|first3=V|last4=Tchounwou|first4=PB|title=Neurotoxic Effects and Biomarkers of Lead Exposure: A Review|journal=Reviews on Environmental Health|volume=24|issue=1|pages=15–45|year=2009|pmid=19476290|pmc=2858639|doi=10.1515/REVEH.2009.24.1.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a child's developing brain, lead interferes with [[synapse]] formation &lt;!-- "syaptic modeling" --&gt; in the [[cerebral cortex]], [[neurochemical]] development (including that of neurotransmitters), and organization of [[ion channel]]s.&lt;ref name="Mycyk05-462"/&gt; It causes loss of neurons' [[myelin]] sheaths, reduces numbers of neurons, interferes with neurotransmission, and decreases neuronal growth.&lt;ref name="Pearson03"/&gt;

&lt;!-- NMDA-Receptor --&gt;
Lead-ions (Pb{{sup|2+}}), like magnesium-ions (Mg{{sup|2+}}), blocks [[NMDA receptor]]s.

Diagnosis includes determining the clinical signs and the medical history, with inquiry into possible routes of exposure.&lt;ref name="Henretig061316"&gt;[[#CITEREFHenretig06|Henretig (2006)]] p. 1316&lt;/ref&gt; [[medical toxicology|Clinical toxicologists]], medical specialists in the area of poisoning, may be involved in diagnosis and treatment.

[[Blood film]] examination may reveal [[basophilic stippling]] of red [[blood cells]] (dots in red blood cells visible through a microscope), as well as the changes normally associated with iron-deficiency anemia ([[microcytosis]] and [[hypochromic|hypochromasia]]).&lt;ref name="Rubin08-267"/&gt; This may be known as [[sideroblastic anemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lubran|first1=MM|title=Lead toxicity and heme biosynthesis.|journal=Annals of Clinical and Laboratory Science|date=1980|volume=10|issue=5|pages=402–13|pmid=6999974}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, basophilic stippling is also seen in unrelated conditions, such as megaloblastic anemia caused by [[vitamin]] B12 (colbalamin) and [[folate]] deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Fischer C |title=Kaplan Medical USMLE Steps 2 and 3 Notes: Internal Medicine, Hematology |pages=176–177 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recommended steps by individuals to reduce the blood lead levels of children include increasing their frequency of hand washing and their intake of calcium and iron, discouraging them from putting their hands to their mouths, vacuuming frequently, and eliminating the presence of lead-containing objects such as blinds and jewellery in the house.&lt;ref name="Payne08"/&gt; In houses with lead pipes or plumbing solder, these can be replaced.&lt;ref name="Payne08"/&gt; Less permanent but cheaper methods include running water in the morning to flush out the most contaminated water, or adjusting the water's chemistry to prevent corrosion of pipes.&lt;ref name="Payne08"/&gt; Lead testing kits are commercially available for detecting the presence of lead in the household.&lt;ref name="Salvato03-117"&gt;[[#CITEREFSalvato03|Salvato (2003)]] p.117&lt;/ref&gt; As hot water is more likely than cold water to contain higher amounts of lead, use only cold water from the tap for drinking, cooking, and for making baby formula.  Since most of the lead in household water usually comes from plumbing in the house and not from the local water supply, using cold water can avoid lead exposure.&lt;ref name="EPH"&gt;National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Measures such as dust control and household education do not appear to be effective in changing children's blood levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nussbaumer-Streit|first=Barbara|last2=Yeoh|first2=Berlinda|last3=Griebler|first3=Ursula|last4=Pfadenhauer|first4=Lisa M.|last5=Busert|first5=Laura K.|last6=Lhachimi|first6=Stefan K.|last7=Lohner|first7=Szimonetta|last8=Gartlehner|first8=Gerald|date=2016-10-16|title=Household interventions for preventing domestic lead exposure in children|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=10|pages=CD006047|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006047.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=27744650|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prevention measures also exist on national and municipal levels.

People receiving dimercaprol need to be assessed for peanut allergies since the commercial formulation contains peanut oil.

SIDE EFFECTS
--&gt;
Chelating agents can have [[adverse medical effect|adverse effects]];&lt;ref name="Brodkin07-CMAJ"/&gt; for example, chelation therapy can lower the body's levels of necessary nutrients like zinc.&lt;ref name="Lightfoot08-VetClin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bradberry|first1=S|last2=Vale|first2=A|title=A comparison of sodium calcium edetate (edetate calcium disodium) and succimer (DMSA) in the treatment of inorganic lead poisoning|journal=Clinical Toxicology|volume=47|issue=9|pages=841–58|year=2009|pmid=19852620|doi=10.3109/15563650903321064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelating agents taken orally can increase the body's absorption of lead through the intestine.&lt;ref name="Pearson03-370"/&gt;

&lt;!--
CHELATION CHALLENGE
--&gt;
Chelation challenge, also known as provocation testing, is used to indicate an elevated and mobilizable body burden of heavy metals including lead.&lt;ref name="Brodkin07-CMAJ"/&gt; This testing involves collecting urine before and after administering a one-off dose of chelating agent to mobilize heavy metals into the urine.&lt;ref name="Brodkin07-CMAJ"/&gt; Then urine is analyzed by a laboratory for levels of heavy metals; from this analysis overall body burden is inferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=BK|last2=Schwartz|first2=BS|last3=Stewart|first3=W|last4=Ahn|first4=KD|title=Provocative chelation with DMSA and EDTA: evidence for differential access to lead storage sites|journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine|volume=52|issue=1|pages=13–9|year=1995|pmid=7697134|pmc=1128144|doi=10.1136/oem.52.1.13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chelation challenge mainly measures the burden of lead in soft tissues, though whether it accurately reflects long-term exposure or the amount of lead stored in bone remains controversial.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Katzung07-948"/&gt; Although the technique has been used to determine whether chelation therapy is indicated and to diagnose heavy metal exposure, some evidence does not support these uses as blood levels after chelation are not comparable to the reference range typically used to diagnose heavy metal poisoning.&lt;ref name="Brodkin07-CMAJ"/&gt; The single chelation dose could also redistribute the heavy metals to more sensitive areas such as central nervous system tissue.&lt;ref name="Brodkin07-CMAJ"/&gt;

&lt;!-- RISK FACTORS --&gt;
Risk factors for elevated lead exposure include alcohol consumption and smoking (possibly because of contamination of tobacco leaves with lead-containing pesticides).&lt;ref name="Hu07"/&gt; Adults with certain risk factors might be more susceptible to toxicity; these include calcium and iron deficiencies, old age, disease of organs targeted by lead (e.g. the brain, the kidneys), and possibly genetic susceptibility.&lt;ref name="Kosnett07EnvironHealthPers"/&gt; &lt;!--
SEX --&gt;
Differences in vulnerability to lead-induced neurological damage between males and females have also been found, but some studies have found males to be at greater risk, while others have found females to be.&lt;ref name="Bellinger04-Pedi"/&gt;

==Prognosis==

===Reversibility===
Outcome is related to the extent and duration of lead exposure.&lt;ref name="Chisolm04-223"&gt;[[#CITEREFChisolm04|Chisolm (2004)]] p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Effects of lead on the physiology of the kidneys and blood are generally reversible; its effects on the central nervous system are not.&lt;ref name="Rubin08-267"/&gt; While peripheral effects in adults often go away when lead exposure ceases, evidence suggests that most of lead's effects on a child's central nervous system are irreversible.&lt;ref name="Bellinger04-Pedi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellinger|first1=DC|title=Lead|journal=Pediatrics|volume=113|issue=4 Suppl|pages=1016–22|year=2004|pmid=15060194|doi=10.1542/peds.113.4.S1.1016|doi-broken-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children with lead poisoning may thus have adverse health, cognitive, and behavioral effects that follow them into adulthood.&lt;ref name="Woolf07-PedClin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woolf|first1=AD|last2=Goldman|first2=R|last3=Bellinger|first3=DC|title=Update on the clinical management of childhood lead poisoning|journal=Pediatric Clinics of North America|volume=54|issue=2|pages=271–94, viii|year=2007|pmid=17448360|doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2007.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encephalopathy===
Lead encephalopathy is a medical emergency and causes permanent brain damage in 70–80% of children affected by it, even those that receive the best treatment.&lt;ref name="Mycyk05-463"/&gt; The mortality rate for people who develop cerebral involvement is about 25%, and of those who survive who had lead encephalopathy symptoms by the time chelation therapy was begun, about 40% have permanent neurological problems such as [[cerebral palsy]].&lt;ref name="Brunton07-31"&gt;[[#CITEREFBrunton07|Brunton (2007)]] p. 1131&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead poisoning was among the first known and most widely studied work and [[environmental hazard]]s.&lt;ref name="Flora08"/&gt; One of the first metals to be [[smelting|smelted]] and used,&lt;ref name="Henretig06"/&gt; lead is thought to have been discovered and first [[mining|mine]]d in [[Anatolia]] around 6500 BC.&lt;ref name="Gilbert06"/&gt; Its density, workability, and corrosion resistance were among the metal's attractions.&lt;ref name="Flora08"/&gt;

&lt;!-- GREEKS --&gt;
In the 2nd century BC the Greek botanist [[Nicander]] described the [[colic]] and [[paralysis]] seen in lead-poisoned people.&lt;ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Need2004" /&gt; [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]], a Greek physician who lived in the 1st century AD, wrote that lead makes the mind "give way".&lt;ref name="Henretig06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Needleman09-AnnEP"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Needleman|first1=H|title=Low level lead exposure: history and discovery|journal=Annals of Epidemiology|volume=19|issue=4|pages=235–8|year=2009|pmid=19344860|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2009.01.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--ROMANS --&gt;
Lead was used extensively in [[Roman aqueduct]]s from about 500 BC to 300 AD&lt;ref name="Gilbert06"/&gt; [[Julius Caesar]]'s engineer, [[Vitruvius]], reported, "water is much more wholesome from [[earthenware]] pipes than from lead pipes. For it seems to be made injurious by lead, because [[white lead]] is produced by it, and this is said to be harmful to the human body."&lt;ref name="Prioreschi98"&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of Medicine, Volume 3 Of Roman Medicine |last= Prioreschi |first= P |year=1998 |publisher= Horatius Press |isbn= 978-1-888456-03-5 |page=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gout]], prevalent in affluent Rome, is thought to be the result of lead, or leaded eating and drinking vessels.  Sugar of lead ([[lead(II) acetate]]) was used to sweeten wine, and the gout that resulted from this was known as "saturnine" gout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Couper RTL. |title=The Severe Gout of Emperor Charles V |journal=N Engl J Med |year=2006 |volume=355 |issue=18 |pages=1935–36 |doi=10.1056/NEJMc062352 |pmid=17079773 |last2=Fernandez |first2=P. L. |last3=Alonso |first3=P. L. |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is even hypothesized that lead poisoning may have contributed to the [[decline of the Roman Empire]],&lt;ref name="Need2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Henretig06"/&gt; a hypothesis thoroughly disputed:

{{quote|The great disadvantage of lead has always been that it is poisonous. This was fully recognised by the ancients, and Vitruvius specifically warns against its use. Because it was nevertheless used in profusion for carrying drinking water, the conclusion has often been drawn that the Romans must therefore have suffered from lead poisoning; sometimes conclusions are carried even further and it is inferred that this caused infertility and other unwelcome conditions, and that lead plumbing was largely responsible for the decline and fall of Rome.

Two things make this otherwise attractive hypothesis impossible. First, the [[calcium carbonate]] deposit that formed so thickly inside the [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]] channels also formed inside the pipes, effectively insulating the water from the lead, so that the two never touched. Second, because the Romans had so few [[faucet|taps]] and the water was constantly running, it was never inside the pipes for more than a few minutes, and certainly not long enough to become contaminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodge|1992|p=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, recent research supports the idea that the lead found in the water came from the supply pipes, rather than another source of contamination. It was not unknown for locals to punch holes in the pipes to draw water off, increasing the number of people exposed to the lead.
{{quote|Thirty years ago, Jerome Nriagu argued in a milestone paper that Roman civilization collapsed as a result of lead poisoning. [[Clair Patterson]], the scientist who convinced governments to ban lead from gasoline, enthusiastically endorsed this idea, which nevertheless triggered a volley of publications aimed at refuting it. Although today lead is no longer seen as the prime culprit of Rome’s demise, its status in the system of water distribution by lead pipes (fistulæ) still stands as a major public health issue.

Romans also consumed lead through the consumption of [[defrutum|defrutum, carenum, and sapa]], [[must]]s made by boiling down fruit in lead cookware. Defrutum and its relatives were used in [[ancient Roman cuisine]] and cosmetics, including as a [[food preservative]].&lt;ref name="Brighton"&gt;{{cite video|title=Tales of the Living Dead: Poisoned Roman Babies|publisher=Brighton TV for National Geographic|people=Director: Chris Warren|medium=television|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of leaden cookware, though popular, was not the general standard and copper cookware was used far more generally. There is also no indication how often sapa was added or in what quantity.

The consumption of sapa as having a role in the fall of the Roman Empire was used in a theory proposed by geochemist Jerome Nriagu&lt;ref name="pmid6338384"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nriagu JO |title=Saturnine gout among Roman aristocrats.

In 1984, John Scarborough, a pharmacologist and classicist, criticized the conclusions drawn by Nriagu's book as "so full of false evidence, miscitations, typographical errors, and a blatant flippancy regarding primary sources that the reader cannot trust the basic arguments."&lt;ref&gt;Scarborough, John (1984).

The painter [[Caravaggio]] might have died of lead poisoning.

Caravaggio is known to have exhibited violent behavior, a symptom commonly associated with lead poisoning.

In 17th-century Germany, the physician [[Eberhard Gockel]] discovered lead-contaminated wine to be the cause of an epidemic of [[colic]].&lt;ref name="Eisinger-colic" /&gt; He had noticed that monks who did not drink wine were healthy, while wine drinkers developed colic,&lt;ref name="Pearce07-EurNeurol"/&gt; and traced the cause to sugar of lead, made by simmering [[litharge]] with vinegar.&lt;ref name="Eisinger-colic" /&gt; As a result, [[Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of Württemberg]] issued an [[edict]] in 1696 banning the adulteration of wines with litharge.&lt;ref name="Eisinger-colic"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisinger|first1=J|title=Lead and wine.

In the 18th century lead poisoning was fairly frequent on account of the widespread drinking of [[rum]], which was made in [[still]]s with a lead component (the "worm"). It was a significant cause of mortality amongst slaves and sailors in the colonial West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Caribbean Connection|title=A Preliminary Investigation of Lead  Poisoning in a Napoleonic Era Naval Cemetery in Antigua, W.I.|volume=2|date=October 2012|authors=Varney, Tamara L, Murphy, A.

&lt;!-- 19TH AND 20TH CENTURIES --&gt;
With the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century, lead poisoning became common in the work setting.&lt;ref name="Henretig06"/&gt; The introduction of lead paint for residential use in the 19th century increased childhood exposure to lead; for millennia before this, most lead exposure had been [[occupational disease|occupational]].&lt;ref name="Bellinger04-Pedi"/&gt; An important step in the understanding of childhood lead poisoning occurred when [[toxicity]] in children from lead paint was recognized in Australia in 1897.&lt;ref name="Henretig06"/&gt; France, Belgium, and Austria banned white lead interior paints in 1909; the [[League of Nations]] followed suit in 1922.&lt;ref name="Gilbert06"/&gt; However, in the United States, laws banning lead house paint were not passed until 1971, and it was phased out and not fully banned until 1978.&lt;ref name="Gilbert06"/&gt;

The 20th century saw an increase in worldwide lead exposure levels due to the increased widespread use of the metal.&lt;ref name="Grant09-757"&gt;[[#CITEREFGrant09|Grant (2009)]] p. 757&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1920s, [[Gasoline#Lead|lead was added to gasoline]] to improve its [[combustion]]; lead from this [[exhaust gas|exhaust]] persists today in [[soil]] and dust in buildings.&lt;ref name="Rossi09"/&gt; [[Blood]] lead levels worldwide have been declining sharply since the 1980s, when leaded gasoline began to be phased out.&lt;ref name="Rossi09"/&gt; In those countries that have banned lead in [[solder]] for food and drink cans and have banned leaded [[gasoline additive]]s, blood lead levels have fallen sharply since the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Mycyk05-467"&gt;[[#CITEREFMycyk05|Mycyk, Hryhorczuk, Amitai (2005)]] p. 467&lt;/ref&gt;

This section of the [[list of rampage killers]] contains those cases that occurred in [[Asia]].

This section does '''not''' include [[List of rampage killers#School massacres|school massacres]]; [[List of rampage killers#Workplace killings|workplace killings]]; [[List of rampage killers#Religious, political or racial crimes|religious, political, or racial crimes]]; or mass murders that took place primarily in a [[List of rampage killers#Domestic violence|domestic environment]], like familicides, which are covered in their own categories. Cases where the primary motive for the murders was to facilitate or cover up another [[felony]], like robbery, are also excluded.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.

All abbreviations used in the table are explained [[#Abbreviations and footnotes|below]].

[[File:LIJ Zuckerberg pavilion fr eastern lawn jeh.jpg|thumb|LIJMC]]
'''Long Island Jewish Medical Center''' (LIJMC or LIJ) is a clinical and [[teaching hospital|academic]] hospital within the [[Northwell Health]] system. It is an 583-bed, non-profit [[tertiary care]] [[teaching hospital]] serving the greater [[New York metropolitan area]]. The {{convert|48|acre|sing=on}} campus is {{convert|15|mi}} east of [[Manhattan]], on the border of [[Queens]] and Nassau Counties, in [[Glen Oaks, Queens]] and [[Lake Success, New York]], respectively. Its postal address is [[New Hyde Park]] (11040 and 11042) on both sides of the [[city limits]].

LIJMC has three components: Long Island Jewish Hospital, Steven &amp; Alexandra Cohen Children’s Medical Center of New York and The [[Zucker Hillside Hospital]]. Long Island Jewish Hospital is a 452-bed tertiary adult care hospital with advanced diagnostic and treatment technology, and modern facilities for medical, surgical, dental and obstetrical care.  As the primary teaching hospital for the [[Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell]] and the Long Island Campus for the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]], LIJMC’s graduate medical education program is one of the largest in New York State, and programs are in divisions headed by full-time faculty.

LIJ's full-time staff includes more than 500 physicians, who supervise care in all major specialties and participate in the medical center’s extensive teaching and research programs.

The medical center is located on the southeast side of [[North Shore Towers]].

The Center was founded in 1954 by a group of nine philanthropists, including [[Jacob H. Horwitz]].&lt;ref name=nyobit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff writer |title=Obituary: Jacob H. Horwitz, 100, Innovator In Fashion and Hospital Founder |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/14/nyregion/jacob-h-horwitz-100-innovator-in-fashion-and-hospital-founder.html |accessdate=5 July 2015 |work=The New York Times |date=14 October 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children born at Long Island Jewish Medical Center are typically born at Katz Women's Hospital, on the [[Queens]] side of the complex, thus those children are born within [[New York City]], not [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]]'s Lake Success.

'''Lottie Cornella Isbell Blake, M.D.,''' (10 June 1876 - 16 November 1976) was an African-American physician, medical missionary, and educator. Blake was the first black Seventh Day Adventist to become a physician. She is remembered for her revolutionary success in hydrotherapy which at the time was not seen as a sophisticated medical treatment. Lottie Blake, along with her husband Dr. [[David Emanuel Blake]], travelled and worked in Panama, Haiti, and Jamaica as a self-supporting medical missionary. During her life, Dr. Lottie Blake became licensed to practice medicine in Ohio, Tennessee, Alabama, Panama, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Blake found the cure for “Smokey City pneumonia” which was caused by smog in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Kim SDA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kim|first1=Haiyoung|title=DR. LOTTIE I. BLAKE: THE FIRST SDA BLACK PHYSICIAN"|url=http://www.adventistheritage.org/article/58/resources/pioneer-stories/dr-lottie-i-blake-the-first-sda-black-physician|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 50 years of service, Lottie Blake was honored by the American Medical Association as eighty-one years old.

== Early Life ==
Lottie Isbell Blake was born in Appomattox, Virginia, the daughter of Fannie and Thomas Isbell. When Lottie was three, the Isbell family moved from Virginia to Columbus, Ohio. Thomas Isbell was a carpenter and Fanny Isbell helped to establish the Union Grove Baptist church while raising Lottie and her nine siblings. The Isbell children were raised as Baptists for much of their youth but when Lottie was twenty years old she, her mother, and her sister Mamie converted to become members of the Seventh-day Adventist church.

== Education ==
Following high school, Blake went on to receive her teaching certification at age 20. Though she had studied to become a teacher, Blake went on to train and work as a nurse at the [[Battle Creek Sanitarium]] in Battle Creek Michigan which was founded by members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, director of the Battle Creek Sanitarium, with whom she lived and worked under became a mentor for Blake during her years as a nurse. Encouraged by Dr. Kellogg, Blake then attended medical school. She graduated from the [[American Medical Missionary College]] in 1902 at 26 years old, becoming the first black Seventh Day Adventist to become a physician.&lt;ref name="Kim SDA" /&gt;

== Early Career ==
Initially, Blake’s missionary work remained within the southern United States. She worked as the director of the Rock City Sanitarium in Nashville, Tennessee and a practicing physician in Birmingham, Alabama. After an epidemic broke out in an orphanage in Huntsville, Alabama, Blake relocated to work there to help. She later went on to work at the Huntsville Oakwood Manual Training School, now Oakwood College, in Huntsville Alabama, where she was the first black faculty member and where she established a nurses training program. After marrying her husband Dr. David Emanuel Blake in 1907, the couple moved to Nashville to work in treatment rooms before moving back to Columbus, Ohio in 1912.

== Missionary Work ==

=== Panama ===
Blake, her husband, and their five children left the United States in 1913 to do missionary work in Panama. The couple served as self-supporting medical missionaries while Lottie Blake cared for their five children. For the four years that the family lived in Panama, Blake engaged in less medical work instead focusing primarily on establishing a school for her children and the children of wealthy people who lived in the area. Yellow Fever and Malaria were the primary illnesses affecting the region of the Panama Canal where the family resided, which became the primary focuses of doctors during that time period. Working with minimal resources, the Blakes were able to successfully acquire the space and equipment to do medical work. It was during this time period in Panama that every member of the Blake family became infected with malaria at some point.

=== Haiti ===
After Panama, the family relocated to Port-au-Prince, Haiti in 1917. With little savings and with Haiti being occupied by U.S. Marines, the Blake family stayed in Haiti for only three months, finding the circumstances to be too challenging to live and work in. In this short period of time, the Blakes did manage to establish a church in Port-au-Prince.

=== Jamaica ===
The Blake family then went to Jamaica, where David Blake had been born and raised, they lived with relatives for eighteen months. 

== Post-Missionary Work ==
Dr. David Blake moved to Charleston, West Virginia with the intention of setting up a medical practice before sending for his family, only he died of pneumonia within a week of arriving in 1917. Lottie Blake sent her children to live with family in Columbus, Ohio while she went to practice in Charleston. In 1920, Blake moved to Columbus where she practiced medicine until 1935. At this point, Blake moved to Pittsburgh, Philadelphia where she focused on the treatment of women and children. It was here that she found the cure for “Smokey City pneumonia”, which was a type of pneumonia caused by the pollution and smog in Pittsburgh. She continued to work in Pittsburgh until her retirement in 1957 at eighty-one years old.

== Death ==
Dr. Lottie Blake died of natural causes November 16, 1976 at 100 years old.&lt;!-- Important, do not remove this line before article has been created. --&gt;

'''Mabel Jones''' (c1865 -1923)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women|last=|first=|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2006|isbn=0 7486 1713 2|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British physician and a sympathizer to the [[Women's Social and Political Union|Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU)]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8Ng3DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT537&amp;lpg=PT537&amp;dq=dr+mabel+jones+suffragette#v=onepage&amp;q=dr%20mabel%20jones%20suffragette&amp;f=false|title=Rise Up Women!: The Remarkable Lives of the Suffragettes|last=Atkinson|first=Diane|date=2018-02-08|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781408844069|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical career ==
Trained in London and from 1898, she worked in a practice with her fellow student, [[Helen Boyle|Dr Helen Boyle]] in Brighton after moving from Hull&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rebel Girls: How votes for women changed Edwardian lives|last=Liddington|first=Jill|publisher=Virago|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then moved on to Glasgow in 1908. Although Dr Jones initially handled the routine cases in Hove, Brighton, the clinic was focused in treating women and it was mostly female led. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thekeep.info/international-womens-day-brightons-pioneering-female-doctors/|title=International Women’s Day: Brighton’s pioneering female doctors - The Keep|date=2015-03-09|work=The Keep|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Jones  was  also noted for helping others who were sympathetic to the cause.&lt;blockquote&gt;"Dr. Mabel Jones did very well in helping the boys to get over their little colds and fevers. ... illustrate how genuine a feminist Paschal had become between two ardent suffragists, his wife and mother, he too called on Dr. Mabel Jones' services"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shining Cycles of Love|last=Dart|first=Anna Coggins|publisher=Wayside Press|year=1959|isbn=|location=University of California|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Queen Elisabeth Medal (Belgium) ==

== Frances Gordon's case ==
Jones evaluated the health state of suffragette [[Frances Gordon]] after she was released from Perth prison. A part of the report she produced was quoted in a letter to the ''Glasgow Evening Times''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/992988822|title=The Scottish suffragettes and the press|last=Sarah|first=Pedersen,|isbn=9781137538345|location=London, United Kingdom|oclc=992988822|date=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;"I saw her (Miss Gordon) at Midnight in July 3. Her appearance was appalling, like a famine victim: the skin brown, her face bones standing out, her eyes half shut, her voice a whisper, her hands quite cold, her pulse a thread."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8A0rDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=%22mabel+jones%22+suffrage#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mabel%20jones%22%20suffrage&amp;f=false|title=The Scottish Suffragettes and the Press|last=Pedersen|first=Sarah|date=2017-07-03|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137538345|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This quote  and the Press exposure of pictures of women on stretchers after release from prisons led to questions in the House of Commons, giving voice to the female suffrage cause&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Parliamentary Debates (official report): House of Commons|last=|first=|publisher=H.M.Stationery Office|year=1914|isbn=|location=Great Britain|pages=cclvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the book ''Martyrs in our Mydst'', Leah Leneman openly questions the level of accuracy of Dr Jones report on Frances Gordon and also challenges the official version:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Comparing the [prison] medical officer's daily reports with Frances Gordon's story as related by Mabel Jones, it is clear that the later did indeed contained a good deal of distortion, but a far greater distortion was the version of the events provided by the medical officer and Chairman of the Prison Commission to the Scottish Office"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Martyrs in our mydst. Dundee, Perth and the forcible feeding of suffragettes.|last=Leneman|first=Leah|publisher=The Abertay Historical Society|year=1993|isbn=|location=Dundee|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Supporting other suffragettes ==
It is uncertain if Jones went to London to meet the Pankhursts to protest that Janie Allan was removed from the West of Scotland branch of the WSPU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide 1866-1928|last=Crawford|first=Elizabeth|publisher=|isbn=978-1135434021|location=|pages=|date=2003-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Women's Library Archive has a printed leaflet of a visit by Dr Jones to Mrs Pankhurst in a cell at the Central Police Station&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/dat/gb106-7kgg/7kgg/3/22|title=The Treatment of Mrs Pankhurst: Dr Mabel Jones's statement|last=|first=|date=11 Mar 1914|website=Women's Library Archive; Katie Gliddon Papers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. She did  also co-examine the gynaecological damage done by the violent use of rectal feeding on [[Frances Parker|Fanny Parker]] &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  and reported in the WSPU newsletters about other cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Becoming 'medical women': British Female Physicians and the Politics of Professionalism|last=Michaelsen|first=Kaaren Leigh|publisher=University of California|year=2003|isbn=|location=Berkeley|pages=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monitor has been a part of [[NHS Improvement]] since 1 April 2016. Previously it was an executive [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[Department of Health (UK)|Department of Health]].  It is the sector regulator for health services in England.  Its chief executive is [[Jim Mackey (Chief Executive)|Jim Mackey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/people/jim-mackey |title=Jim Mackey |publisher=GOV.UK |date= |accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its Chair is [[Ed Smith (NHS)|Ed Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/people/ed-smith |title=Ed Smith CBE, FCA, CPFA, Hon DUniv, Hon LLDs |publisher=GOV.UK |date=2016-04-01 |accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The body was established in 2004 under the [[Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/43/section/2 |title=Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2007-01-03 |accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made it responsible for authorising, monitoring and regulating NHS [[foundation trust]]s.

The [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/7/part/3/chapter/1/enacted |title=Health and Social Care Act 2012 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date=2016-11-14 |accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave Monitor additional duties.

In addition to assessing NHS trusts for foundation trust status and ensuring that foundation trusts are well led, in terms of quality and finances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monitor.gov.uk/about-monitor/how-we-do-it/how-monitor-regulates-nhs-foundation-trusts |title=Home &amp;#124; NHS Improvement |publisher=Monitor.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monitor also has a duty to:

* set prices for NHS-funded care in partnership with [[NHS England]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monitor.gov.uk/regulating-health-care-providers-commissioners/regulating-prices-nhs-funded-care/why-the-payment-sys |title=Home &amp;#124; NHS Improvement |publisher=Monitor.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* enable [[integrated care]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monitor.gov.uk/regulating-health-care-providers-commissioners/enabling-integrated-care |title=Home &amp;#124; NHS Improvement |publisher=Monitor.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* safeguard [[patient choice]] and prevent anti-competitive behaviour which is against the interests of patients;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monitor.gov.uk/regulating-health-care-providers-commissioners/cooperation-and-competition |title=Home &amp;#124; NHS Improvement |publisher=Monitor.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 
* support commissioners to protect essential health care services for patients if a provider gets into financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monitor.gov.uk/regulating-health-care-providers-commissioners/supporting-the-continuity-services |title=Home &amp;#124; NHS Improvement |publisher=Monitor.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monitor's main tool for carrying out these functions is the NHS provider licence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monitor.gov.uk/regulating-health-care-providers-commissioners/licensing-providers |title=Home &amp;#124; NHS Improvement |publisher=Monitor.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contains obligations for providers of NHS services.

The Health and Social Care Act 2012 requires everyone who provides an NHS health care service to hold a licence unless they are exempt under regulations made by the Department of Health.

Foundation trusts are licensed from 1 April 2013. All other non-exempt providers will be required to apply for a licence from April 2014.

It was announced in June 2015 that the chief executive posts at '''Monitor''' and the [[NHS Trust Development Authority]] were to be merged, although there would not be a complete merger of the organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TDA and Monitor to share single chief executive|url=http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2015/06/tda-and-monitor-share-single-chief-executive|accessdate=21 July 2015|publisher=Public Finance|date=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016 both organisations became part of [[NHS Improvement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=KPMG wins £1m contract to design NHS Improvement|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/home/updated-kpmg-wins-1m-contract-to-design-nhs-improvement/5091477.article|accessdate=14 November 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In July 2014, Monitor was criticised by the [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons (PAC)]] for the lack of clinical expertise and frontline NHS experience amongst its staff.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (2014) [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmpubacc/407/40703.htm “Public Accounts Committee - Fourth Report. Monitor: regulating NHS Foundation Trusts”], Conclusions and Recommendations (4). Prepared 4 July 2014. Retrieved 10 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The PAC noted that: “Only 21 of Monitor's 337 staff have an NHS operational background and only 7 have a clinical background, which damages Monitor's credibility in dealing with trusts and its effectiveness in diagnosing problems and developing solutions”.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (2014) [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmpubacc/407/40703.htm “Public Accounts Committee - Fourth Report. Monitor: regulating NHS Foundation Trusts”], Conclusions and Recommendations (4), Prepared 4 July 2014. Retrieved 10 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The PAC also criticised the proportion of Monitor’s budget spent on external consultants (£9 million of Monitor's £48 million budget in 2013-14) and found that “some NHS foundation trusts had been allowed to struggle for far too long in breach of their regulatory conditions. It has taken Monitor too long to help trusts in difficulty to improve, with three trusts having been in breach of their regulatory conditions since 2009”.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (2014) [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmpubacc/407/40703.htm “Public Accounts Committee - Fourth Report. Monitor: regulating NHS Foundation Trusts”], Conclusions and Recommendations (2), Prepared 4 July 2014. Retrieved 10 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the PAC’s hearing, of 147 foundation trusts 39(26%) were expected to be in deficit by the end of 2013-14 and on 31 December 2013 25 (17%) were in breach of the conditions attached to their status.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (2014) [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmpubacc/407/40703.htm “Public Accounts Committee - Fourth Report. Monitor: regulating NHS Foundation Trusts”], Conclusions and Recommendations (3), Prepared 4 July 2014. Retrieved 10 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
The PAC also noted: “It is wholly inappropriate that the same person acted as both Chair and Chief Executive of Monitor between March 2011 and January 2014. This was contrary to corporate governance good practice and Monitor's own guidance to NHS foundation trusts”.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (2014) [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmpubacc/407/40703.htm “Public Accounts Committee - Fourth Report. Monitor: regulating NHS Foundation Trusts”], Conclusions and Recommendations (9), Prepared 4 July 2014. Retrieved 10 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The board of MONITOR  has a majority representation from former or seconded employees of KPMG, PWC and Deloitte while still awarding contracts to these organisations worth millions of pounds http://www.reasonandreality.org/?p=2400.

== Regulatory action ==
In July 2013 six [[NHS Foundation Trust]]s were [http://www.monitor.gov.uk/home/news-events-publications/latest-press-releases/health-sector-regulator-puts-six-foundation-trus placed in special measures] as a result of the [[Keogh Review]] of patient safety:

* [[Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]]
* [[Burton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]]
* [[Medway NHS Foundation Trust]]
* [[Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]]
* [[Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]]
* [[Tameside Hospital NHS Foundation Trust]]

Subsequent Trusts  placed in special measures:

* [[The Queen Elizabeth Hospital King’s Lynn NHS Foundation Trust]] October 2013
* [[East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust]] August 2014 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=East Kent Health Trust placed into special measures by Monitor following damning CQC report on sites in Canterbury, Ashford and Margate|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/canterbury/news/health-trust-placed-into-special-22735/|accessdate=28 September 2014|publisher=Kent Online|date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enforcement action has been taken on 21 occasions in the first 10 months of 2013/4, compared to just nine instances in the whole of 2012-13. Monitor's former chief executive David Bennett admitted the regulator’s “arm’s length” distance from foundation trusts had become “a little shorter” as it intervened more readily and that increased monitoring and intervention was explained by “a declined appetite for risk” among “Parliament, the government and the public”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Monitor interventions double in response to Francis|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/exclusive-monitor-interventions-double-in-response-to-francis/5067481.article#.UveLE4WAQUE|accessdate=9 February 2014|newspaper=Health Service Journal|date=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Details of the regulatory action Monitor has taken at NHS foundation trusts are available on its website: http://www.monitor.gov.uk/about-your-local-nhs-foundation-trust/regulatory-action/nhs-foundation-trusts-special-measures-or-un.

In August 2015 Monitor issued a letter to all Foundation Trusts telling them to fill vacancies “only where essential” and warning that current financial plans are “quite simply unaffordable” as NHS providers collectively forecast a deficit of £2bn in 2015-16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS told to fill only essential vacancies due to 'almost unprecedented' finances|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/04/nhs-told-to-fill-vacancies-only-where-essential-due-to-looming-funding-crisis|accessdate=22 August 2015|publisher=Guardian|date=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stafford Hospital investigation ==
In 2010 the [[Stafford Hospital scandal]] investigation recommended that Monitor de-authorise the [[Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust]].&lt;ref name=francis-report&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_113018|title=Robert Francis Inquiry report into Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust|author=Robert Francis QC|publisher=House of Commons|date=24 February 2010|isbn=978-0-10-296439-4|accessdate=2010-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with the investigation report recommendation, [[Secretary of State for Health]], [[Andy Burnham]], agreed to a further Independent Inquiry of the commissioning, supervisory and regulatory bodies for Foundation Trusts.&lt;ref name=francis-report /&gt;

==Anti-competitive behaviour==
[[Spire Healthcare]] alleged in 2013 that a block contract agreed between [[Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]] and the [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s in Blackpool, and Fylde and Wyre offered a “clear incentive” for GPs to refer patients to the foundation trust and that this was anti-competitive behaviour.  The contract provided the trust with a guaranteed income regardless of the number of patients that chose to use its services.  Monitor conducted an investigation and decided In September 2014 that there was no evidence to support the claim though they did conclude that Blackpool CCG’s plans did not “go far enough” to ensure patients would be offered choice, or that the right to choice would be “publicised and promoted”.  Blackpool CCG complained that not a single GP, practice manager or patient was spoken to by the investigating team, nor was a single practice visited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Regulator rejects private hospital's complaint against CCGs|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/finance/regulator-rejects-private-hospitals-complaint-against-ccgs/5075165.article#.VEq49isoKzY|accessdate=24 October 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014 former chief executive David Bennett admitted that the organisation had yet to identify a strategy to counter those opposed to competition because it clashed with their personal ideologies. He claimed  organisations were using competition regulations as an “easy excuse” for avoiding making necessary changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bennett: Monitor ‘struggling’ to get message across on competition|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/bennett-monitor-struggling-to-get-message-across-on-competition/5075145.article#.VErIICsoKzY|accessdate=25 October 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014 after the publication of [[NHS England]]'s ‘Five year forward view’ Bennett defended Choice and competition as "one of the ways in which we can drive change and improvement for patients, and we don’t see that that will cease to be the case.” - though competition was not mentioned by NHS England.  He also said that Monitor, the [[NHS Trust Development Authority]] and NHS England planned to develop “a whole system, geographically based intervention regime” which could, include a ‘special measures’ approach to areas facing serious problems with care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bennett: Competition can ‘drive improvement’ for patients|url=http://www.healthinvestor.co.uk/ShowArticle.aspx?ID=3599|accessdate=15 November 2014|publisher=Health Investor|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Zealand AIDS Foundation''' (NZAF) is [[Aotearoa New Zealand]]’s national [[HIV]] prevention and healthcare organisation.  Its funding is derived from grants, donations and the Ministry of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moh.govt.nz/moh.nsf|title=Ministry of Health NZ|work=Ministry of Health NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NZAF has a vision of ‘a world without AIDS’ and aims to achieve this by preventing the transmission of HIV and supporting people affected by HIV and AIDS.

==Programs==
The NZAF provides health and support services to people with HIV to maximise their health and their ability to maintain [[safe sex]]ual practice,&lt;ref&gt;UNGASS Country Progress Report New Zealand Jan 2008-Dec 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and HIV prevention programmes targeted at the communities most at risk, including HIV and syphilis rapid testing and sexual health clinics.  The NZAF also undertakes research, strategic analysis and policy advice.

The NZAF National Office is in Auckland, and there are regional centres in [[Christchurch]] and [[Wellington]].  The NZAF employs more than 40 staff and has well over 100 regular volunteers.  There are also NZAF-trained professional contractors providing HIV and [[syphilis]] rapid testing and counselling in many other regions across Aotearoa New Zealand.
Outside of Aotearoa New Zealand, the NZAF manages an international development programme working with partners in the Pacific committed to the rights and health of Pacific men who have sex with men and [[transgender]] people.

==History==
Founded in 1985, the NZAF has grown from the response of Aotearoa New Zealand’s [[gay]] communities to the impending HIV [[epidemic]]. From its earliest days as a [[grassroots movement]], the NZAF provides a New Zealand  response to HIV, bringing history, passion, knowledge, and diversity to fight the emerging trends of the HIV epidemic.

During 2009, the NZAF introduced the NZAF HIV Prevention Plan 2009-2014;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzaf.org.nz/hiv-prevention/item/hiv-prevention-plan-2009-2014]&lt;/ref&gt; a significant review and redesign of the population health programme. The plan includes a clear focus on building a [[condom]] culture in Aotearoa New Zealand.  Get it On!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getiton.co.nz/|title=Great Safe Gay Sex Information Website for Gay Men in NZ from L.Y.C|work=getiton.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the new [[social marketing]] programme developed and supported by the NZAF that is committed to doing that.  An important part of this programme is the largest gay community event in Aotearoa New Zealand, the Get it On! [[Big Gay Out]].

'''Nicola Ferguson Sturgeon''' (born 19 July 1970) is a Scottish politician serving as the [[List of First Ministers of Scotland|fifth]] and current [[First Minister of Scotland]] and leader of the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) since November 2014. She is the first woman to hold either position. Sturgeon has been a member of the [[Scottish Parliament]] since 1999, first as an [[additional member system|additional member]] for the [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Glasgow electoral region]] from 1999 to 2007 and as the member for [[Glasgow Southside (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Southside]] since 2007 (known as [[Glasgow Govan (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] from 2007 to 2011).

A law graduate of the [[University of Glasgow]], Sturgeon worked as a [[solicitor]] in [[Glasgow]]. After being elected to the Scottish Parliament, she served successively as the SNP's shadow minister for education, health, and justice. In 2004 she announced that she would stand as a candidate for the leadership of the SNP following the resignation of [[John Swinney]]. However, she later withdrew from the contest in favour of [[Alex Salmond]], standing instead as [[wikt:depute|depute]] (deputy)&lt;!-- This is how the SNP spell that word: "depute". It is not a spelling error--&gt; leader on a joint ticket with Salmond.

Both were subsequently elected, and as Salmond was still an MP in the House of Commons, Sturgeon led the SNP in the Scottish Parliament from 2004 to 2007. The SNP won the highest number of seats in the Scottish Parliament in [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2007|the 2007 election]] and Salmond was subsequently appointed First Minister. He appointed Sturgeon as [[Deputy First Minister of Scotland|Deputy First Minister]] and [[Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing]]. She was appointed as [[Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Investment and Cities]] in 2012.

Following the defeat of the [[Yes Scotland|"Yes"]] campaign in the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|2014 Scottish independence referendum]], Salmond announced that he would be resigning as party leader at the SNP party conference that November, and would resign as First Minister after a new leader was chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/alex-salmond-resignation-nicola-sturgeon-destiny|title=Alex Salmond's resignation could give Nicola Sturgeon her day of destiny|author=Libby Brooks|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 September 2014|accessdate=19 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209154913/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/19/alex-salmond-resignation-nicola-sturgeon-destiny|archivedate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; No one else was nominated for the post by the time nominations closed, leaving Sturgeon to [[Scottish National Party leadership election, 2014|take the party leadership unopposed]] at the SNP's annual conference. She was formally elected to succeed Salmond as First Minister on 19 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-30011421|title=The transition from Alex Salmond to Nicola Sturgeon|first=Glenn|last=Campbell|work=BBC News|date=13 November 2014|accessdate=19 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117032228/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-30011421|archivedate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sturgeon grew up in [[Prestwick]] and [[Dreghorn]]. She attended Dreghorn Primary School from 1975 to 1982 and [[Greenwood Academy, Dreghorn|Greenwood Academy]] from 1982 to 1988. She later studied at the [[University of Glasgow]], where she read [[Law]]. Sturgeon graduated with a [[Bachelor of Laws]] (Hons) in 1992 and a [[Diploma in Legal Practice]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alba.org.uk/scot07constit/g04.html |title=Candidates and Constituency Assessments |publisher=Alba.org.uk |date= |accessdate=17 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606052650/http://www.alba.org.uk/scot07constit/g04.html |archivedate=6 June 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; During her time at Glasgow University she was active as a member of the [[Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association]] and the [[students' representative council]].

Following her graduation, Sturgeon completed her legal traineeship at McClure Naismith, a Glasgow firm of solicitors, in 1995. After qualifying as a [[solicitor]], she worked for Bell &amp; Craig, a firm of solicitors in [[Stirling]], and later at the [[Drumchapel]] [[Law Centre]] in [[Glasgow]] from 1997 until her election to the [[Scottish Parliament]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-25333635|title=The Nicola Sturgeon story|last=Sim|first=Philip|date=26 May 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=21 November 2017|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915002848/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-25333635|archivedate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
Sturgeon joined the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) in 1986, having already become a member of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and quickly became their Youth Affairs Vice Convener and Publicity Vice Convener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snp.org/media-centre/news/2014/apr/sturgeon-now-or-never-banish-trident|title=Sturgeon: "Now or never" to banish Trident|date=5 April 2014|accessdate=6 July 2014|publisher=Scottish National Party|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708202748/http://www.snp.org/media-centre/news/2014/apr/sturgeon-now-or-never-banish-trident|archivedate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snp.org/nicola_sturgeon_fm |title=About: Nicola Sturgeon MSP |publisher=Scottish National Party |accessdate=2 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715123308/http://www.snp.org/nicola_sturgeon_fm |archivedate=15 July 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; She first stood for election in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 general election]] as the SNP candidate in the [[Glasgow Shettleston (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Shettleston]] constituency, and was the youngest parliamentary candidate in Scotland, failing to win the seat.

Sturgeon also stood unsuccessfully as the SNP candidate for the Irvine North [[Ward (electoral subdivision)|ward]] on [[Cunninghame]] District Council in May 1992, for the [[Baillieston]]/[[Mount Vernon, Glasgow|Mount Vernon]] ward on [[Strathclyde|Strathclyde Regional Council]] in 1994, and for the [[Bridgeton, Glasgow|Bridgeton]] ward on [[Glasgow City Council]] in 1995.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In the mid-1990s, Sturgeon and [[Charles Kennedy]] went together on a political study visit to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-32975311|title=Sturgeon on Charles Kennedy 'a most talented politician'|work=BBC News|date=2 June 2015|accessdate=4 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602110544/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-32975311|archivedate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dathan|first1=Matt|title=Nicola Sturgeon reveals how she and Charles Kennedy watched Trainspotting together as she pays tribute to former Lib Dem leader|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nicola-sturgeon-reveals-how-she-and-charles-kennedy-watched-trainspotting-together-as-she-pays-tribute-to-former-lib-dem-leader-10292645.html|website=independent.co.uk|date=2 June 2015|accessdate=4 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603075431/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nicola-sturgeon-reveals-how-she-and-charles-kennedy-watched-trainspotting-together-as-she-pays-tribute-to-former-lib-dem-leader-10292645.html|archivedate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]] saw Sturgeon selected to fight the [[Glasgow Govan (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]] seat for the SNP. Boundary changes meant that the notional [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] majority in the seat had increased substantially. However, infighting between the two rival candidates for the Labour nomination, [[Mohammad Sarwar (politician)|Mohammed Sarwar]] and [[Mike Watson, Baron Watson of Invergowrie|Mike Watson]], along with an energetic local campaign, resulted in Glasgow Govan being the only Scottish seat to see a swing away from Labour in the midst of a Labour [[Landslide victory|landslide]] nationwide. Sarwar did, however, win the seat with a majority of 2,914 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/news/05/0505/stats.shtml|title=BBC Politics 97|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324034533/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/news/05/0505/stats.shtml|archivedate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this, Sturgeon was appointed as the SNP's spokesperson for energy and education matters.

Sturgeon stood for election to the [[Scottish Parliament]] in the [[Scottish Parliamentary Election, 1999|first Scottish Parliament election]] in 1999 as the SNP candidate for [[Glasgow Govan (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Govan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicola-Sturgeon|title=Nicola Sturgeon {{!}} Biography &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=21 November 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171008035648/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicola-Sturgeon|archivedate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she failed to win the seat, she was placed first in the SNP's regional list for the [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliamentary Electoral Area)|Glasgow region]], and was thus elected as a [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]].  During the first term of the Scottish Parliament, Sturgeon served as a member of the [[Shadow Cabinet]]s of both [[Alex Salmond]] and [[John Swinney]]. She was [[Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning|Shadow Minister for Children and Education]] from 1999 to 2000, [[Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing|Shadow Minister for Health and Community Care]] from 2000 to 2003, and [[Cabinet Secretary for Justice|Shadow Minister for Justice]] from 2003 to 2004.

==Depute Leader and Deputy First Minister==
[[File:Scottish Cabinet, May 2011.jpg|thumb|left|Sturgeon (front right) with Alex Salmond and the rest of the Scottish Government cabinet following election in 2011]]
On 22 June 2004, John Swinney resigned as Leader of the SNP following poor results in the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (United Kingdom)|European Parliament election]]. His then-depute,&lt;!-- This is how the SNP spell that word: "depute". It is not a spelling error--&gt; [[Roseanna Cunningham]], immediately announced her intention to stand for the leadership. The previous leader, Alex Salmond, announced at the time that he would not stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3828657.stm |title=Under-fire SNP leader resigns |publisher=BBC News |date=22 June 2004 |accessdate=17 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040627024827/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3828657.stm |archivedate=27 June 2004  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 June 2004, Sturgeon announced that she would also be a candidate in the forthcoming election for the leadership, with [[Kenny MacAskill]] as her running mate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3835951.stm |title=Sturgeon contests SNP leadership |work=BBC News |date=24 June 2004 |accessdate=17 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040702040939/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3835951.stm |archivedate=2 July 2004  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Salmond later announced that he did intend to stand for the leadership; Sturgeon subsequently withdrew from the contest and declared her support for Salmond, standing instead as his running mate for the depute&lt;!-- This is how the SNP spell that word: "depute". It is not a spelling error--&gt; leadership. It was reported that Salmond had privately supported Sturgeon in her leadership bid, but decided to run for the position himself as it became apparent she was unlikely to beat Cunningham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Swanson |first=Ian |url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=809422004 |title=Edinburgh News- "Salmond in shock bid for leader" |publisher=Edinburghnews.scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=17 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050921102702/http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=809422004 |archivedate=21 September 2005  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the SNP hierarchy lent their support to the Salmond-Sturgeon bid for the leadership, although MSP [[Alex Neil (politician)|Alex Neil]] backed Salmond as leader, but refused to endorse Sturgeon as depute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Denholm |first=Andrew |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=922912004 |title=Scotsman.com- "Salmond's arch-rival buries hatchet with declaration of support" |publisher=Thescotsman.scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=17 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101133105/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=922912004 |archivedate=1 November 2005  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the leadership contest were announced on 3 September 2004, with Salmond and Sturgeon elected as Leader and Depute&lt;!-- This is how the SNP spell that word: "depute".

As leader of the SNP in the Scottish Parliament, Sturgeon became a high-profile figure in Scottish politics and often clashed with [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] [[Jack McConnell]] at [[First Minister's Question Time (Scotland)|First Minister's Questions]]. This included rows over the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons']] decision to replace the Trident nuclear weapon system, and the SNP's plans to replace [[council tax]] in Scotland with a [[local income tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6454509.stm |title=Parties clash on Trident and tax |publisher=BBC News |date=15 March 2007 |accessdate=17 January 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319190615/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6454509.stm |archivedate=19 March 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sturgeon defeated [[Gordon Jackson (politician)|Gordon Jackson]] with a 4.7% swing to the SNP in the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007 election]] in Glasgow Govan. The election resulted in a hung parliament, with the SNP the largest party by a single seat; the SNP subsequently formed a minority government. Sturgeon was appointed as the [[Deputy First Minister of Scotland|Deputy First Minister]] and [[Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing]] by [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] Salmond. In the position she saw through party pledges such as scrapping prescription charges and reversing [[Emergency department|accident and emergency]] closures, she also became more widely known internationally for her handling of the [[2009 flu pandemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-25333635|title=The Nicola Sturgeon story|publisher=BBC News|date=19 November 2014|accessdate=20 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212154331/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-25333635|archivedate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/sturgeon-snp-scotland-independence-campaign|title=Rise of Nicola Sturgeon: from 'nippy sweetie' to SNP leader?|publisher=Channel 4 News|date=24 September 2014|accessdate=20 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221003604/http://www.channel4.com/news/sturgeon-snp-scotland-independence-campaign|archivedate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was supported in her role as Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing by [[Shona Robison]] MSP, the [[Minister for Public Health and Sport]], and by Alex Neil MSP, the [[Minister for Housing and Communities]].

Sturgeon was retained as Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing until a reshuffle one year later, when she was appointed as [[Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Investment and Cities]] and an additional role overseeing the [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|referendum on]] [[Scottish independence]], essentially putting her in charge of the SNP's referendum campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-19487544|title=Scottish cabinet reshuffle: Nicola Sturgeon given new independence role|date=5 September 2012|accessdate=6 July 2014|publisher=BBC News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031082123/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-19487544|archivedate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, Sturgeon said that she believed that independence would allow Scotland to build a stronger and more competitive country, and would change spending priorities to address "the scandal of soaring poverty in a country as rich as Scotland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/25/scotland-independence-economy-grow-sturgeon |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Severin |last=Carrell |title=Scottish independence would allow economy to grow, says Sturgeon |date=25 May 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221151359/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/25/scotland-independence-economy-grow-sturgeon |archivedate=21 December 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The personal debt of gratitude I owe Alex is immeasurable. He has been my friend, mentor and colleague for more than 20 years. Quite simply, I would not have been able to do what I have in politics without his constant advice, guidance and support through all these years.

On 19 November 2014, Salmond formally resigned as [[First Minister of Scotland]] and the election for the new First Minister took place the following day. Sturgeon and [[Ruth Davidson]], the leader of the [[Scottish Conservative Party|Scottish Conservatives]], stood for election. Sturgeon received 66 votes, Davidson received 15 and there were 39 abstentions. As mentioned above, the SNP's absolute majority made Sturgeon's election all but certain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Nicola Sturgeon is elected first minister of Scotland|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-30118626|work = BBC News|date = 19 November 2014|access-date = 28 January 2016|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150220125708/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-30118626|archivedate = 20 February 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sturgeon was formally sworn into office the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/nicola-sturgeon-sworn-in-as-first-minister-1-3610975 |title=Nicola Sturgeon sworn in as First Minister |publisher=Johnston Press |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=20 November 2014 |accessdate=23 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141123073826/http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/nicola-sturgeon-sworn-in-as-first-minister-1-3610975 |archivedate=23 November 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 November 2014, she was appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] and therefore granted the title, '[[The Right Honourable]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privy Council appointments: November 2014|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/privy-council-appointments-november-2014|website=Press release|publisher=Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street|accessdate=16 April 2015|date=20 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110103205/https://www.gov.uk/government/news/privy-council-appointments-november-2014|archivedate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 November, she unveiled her [[Scottish Cabinet|Cabinet]] with a 50/50 gender balance, promoting [[Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Employment and Sustainable Growth|Finance Secretary]] John Swinney to become her [[Deputy First Minister of Scotland|Deputy First Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/21/nicola-sturgeon-scottish-cabinet-equal-gender-balance |title=Nicola Sturgeon announces Scottish cabinet with equal gender balance |newspaper=The Guardian |date=21 November 2014 |accessdate=2 May 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514192555/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/21/nicola-sturgeon-scottish-cabinet-equal-gender-balance |archivedate=14 May 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By most accounts, Sturgeon took a more conciliatory approach to governing than Salmond.{{failed verification|date=June 2018}}  For instance, during her first First Minister's Questions after being sworn in, she said that she came into her new post "with an open mind and a willingness to hear proposals from all sides of the chamber."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLkmguGQ8a4 Nicola Sturgeon officially sworn in as Scotland's First Minister].

====UK 2015 general election====
Sturgeon took part in several Scottish and UK-wide [[United Kingdom general election debates, 2015|TV election debates]] in the run up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]] and according to opinion polls was regarded to have had a successful performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/polls-confirm-nicola-sturgeon-tv-debate-success-1-3747812 |title=Polls "confirm Nicola Sturgeon TV debate success" |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=21 April 2015 |accessdate=13 May 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518100132/http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/polls-confirm-nicola-sturgeon-tv-debate-success-1-3747812 |archivedate=18 May 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SNP went on to win a [[landslide victory]] in Scotland, winning 56 out of 59 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32635871|title=BElection 2015: SNP wins 56 of 59 seats in Scots landslide|work=BBC News|date=8 May 2015|accessdate=29 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521003643/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32635871|archivedate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 April 2015, a leaked memo from the [[Scotland Office]] alleged that Sturgeon privately told the French ambassador [[Sylvie Bermann]] that she would "rather see David Cameron remain as PM". This was in contrast to her publicly stated opposition to a Conservative Government on the run up to the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=John|first1=Simon|title=Nicola Sturgeon secretly backs David Cameron|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/SNP/11514933/Nicola-Sturgeon-secretly-backs-David-Cameron.html|website=telegraph.co.uk|date=3 April 2015|accessdate=26 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421104508/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/SNP/11514933/Nicola-Sturgeon-secretly-backs-David-Cameron.html|archivedate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memo was quickly denied by both Sturgeon and the French consulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lewis |last=Smith |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/sturgeon-denies-telling-french-ambassador-she-wants-the-tories-to-win-the-election-10155267.html |title='Categorically, 100%, untrue': Nicola Sturgeon denies telling French ambassador she wants the Tories to win the election |publisher=Independent Print Limited |newspaper=The Independent |date=3 April 2015 |accessdate=17 June 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617184706/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/sturgeon-denies-telling-french-ambassador-she-wants-the-tories-to-win-the-election-10155267.html |archivedate=17 June 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32182452|title=French consul general denies Nicola Sturgeon Tory comments|website=BBC News|date=4 April 2015|accessdate=29 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407082959/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32182452|archivedate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later noted that the memo had contained a disclaimer that parts of the conversation may have been "lost in translation" and its release had been ordered by then [[Secretary of State for Scotland|Scottish Secretary]] [[Alistair Carmichael]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Settle|first1=Michael|title=Carmichael caught in his own tangled web of deceit|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/wider-political-news/carmichael-caught-in-his-own-tangled-web-of-deceit.126958092|website=HeraldScotland.com|accessdate=23 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526012230/http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/wider-political-news/carmichael-caught-in-his-own-tangled-web-of-deceit.126958092|archivedate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32874009|title=Alistair Carmichael rejects calls to resign over leaked Nicola Sturgeon memo|website=BBC News|date=25 May 2015|accessdate=29 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527214320/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32874009|archivedate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sturgeon stated that Carmichael had "engaged in dirty tricks" and that he should consider his position as an [[Member of Parliament|MP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32849065|title=Nicola Sturgeon condemns Alistair Carmichael leak 'dirty tricks'|website=BBC News|date=22 May 2015|accessdate=29 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525040118/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32849065|archivedate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scottish Parliament election, 2016====
Sturgeon contested her first election as SNP leader at the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2016|2016 election]]. The SNP fell two seats short of securing another overall majority. Nonetheless, with 63 seats, the SNP was still by far the largest party in the chamber, with more than double the seats of the next-largest party, the Scottish Tories.&lt;ref name="results"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-scotland-36243712 |title=New MSPs to arrive at Holyrood for first day |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=9 May 2016 |accessdate=9 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509101055/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-scotland-36243712 |archivedate=9 May 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="map"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-36215186 |title=Election 2016: Before-and-after and party strength maps |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=6 May 2016 |accessdate=9 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509104930/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2016-36215186 |archivedate=9 May 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sturgeon was formally nominated for a second term on 17 May, defeating Lib Dem leader [[Willie Rennie]] by a vote of 63 to 5, with 59 members abstaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36300892 | title=Nicola Sturgeon wins Scottish first minister vote | work=BBC News | publisher=BBC | date=17 May 2016 | accessdate=17 May 2016 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517211603/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36300892 | archivedate=17 May 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second term, 2016–===
====2016 EU membership referendum====
[[File:Nicola Sturgeon meets EU diplomats following the Brexit result.jpg|thumb|left|Sturgeon meets diplomats from 27 [[European Union]] countries at [[Bute House]] to address the rights and conditions of EU nationals resident in Scotland following the EU referendum result]]
The UK Government held a referendum to decide the future of the United Kingdom's European Union membership in which all 32 council areas in Scotland voted by a majority for the United Kingdom to remain a member of the EU. Across Scotland, 62% of voters backed the UK remaining a member of the EU, with 38% voting for the UK to leave. Overall 52% of voters in the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU, with 48% voting to remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum/results|title=EU Referendum Results|publisher=BBC News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624000307/http://www.bbc.com/news/politics/eu_referendum/results|archivedate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the result, on 24 June 2016, Sturgeon said that [[Scottish Government]] officials would begin planning for a second independence referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/scotland-could-seek-independence-again-after-u-k-brexit-vote-n598166|title=Scotland Seeks Independence Again After U.K. 'Brexit' Vote|first=Alastair|last=Jamieson|date=24 June 2016|work=NBC News|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624095905/http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/scotland-could-seek-independence-again-after-u-k-brexit-vote-n598166|archivedate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/world/europe/brexit-scotland-independence-referendum.html|title=Scotland Says New Vote on Independence Is ‘Highly Likely’|first=Kimiko|last=De Freytas-Tamura|date=25 June 2016|work=The New York Times|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216050257/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/world/europe/brexit-scotland-independence-referendum.html|archivedate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sturgeon claimed that it was "clear that the people of Scotland see their future as part of the European Union" and that Scotland had "spoken decisively" with a "strong, unequivocal" vote to remain in the European Union.&lt;ref name="ft2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/06a90f8c-39c0-11e6-a780-b48ed7b6126f.html#axzz4CRXecPen|title=Scots' backing for Remain raises threat of union's demise|first=Mure|last=Dickie|date=24 June 2016|newspaper=Financial Times|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160627153845/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/06a90f8c-39c0-11e6-a780-b48ed7b6126f.html#axzz4CRXecPen|archivedate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sturgeon said it was "democratically unacceptable" that Scotland could be taken out of the EU "against its will".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1716977/second-scotland-referendum-highly-likely|title=Second Scotland Referendum 'Highly Likely'|publisher=Sky News|date=24 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624120648/http://news.sky.com/story/1716977/second-scotland-referendum-highly-likely|archivedate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June, Sturgeon said she would communicate to all EU member states that Scotland had voted to stay in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-result-live-counting-leave-remain-brain-in-europe|title=Nicola Sturgeon says second Scottish referendum 'highly likely' – as it happened|date=24 June 2016|publisher=The Guardian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211043100/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-result-live-counting-leave-remain-brain-in-europe|archivedate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An emergency Scottish cabinet meeting on 25 June agreed that the Scottish Government would seek to enter negotiations with the EU and its member states, to explore options to protect Scotland's place in the EU."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/25/sturgeon-seeks-urgent-brussels-talks-to-protect-scotlands-eu-membership|title=Sturgeon to lobby EU members to support Scotland's bid to remain|first1=Severin|last1=Carrell|first2=Jennifer|last2=Rankin|date=25 June 2016|work=The Guardian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103182025/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/25/sturgeon-seeks-urgent-brussels-talks-to-protect-scotlands-eu-membership|archivedate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stv250616"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stv.tv/news/politics/1358598-sturgeon-to-seek-eu-talks-to-protect-scotland-s-memebrship/ |title=Sturgeon to seek EU talks to 'protect' Scotland's membership |first=Aidan |last=Kerr |website=STV News |publisher=STV |date=25 June 2016 |accessdate=27 June 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628005333/http://stv.tv/news/politics/1358598-sturgeon-to-seek-eu-talks-to-protect-scotland-s-memebrship/ |archivedate=28 June 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sturgeon later said that while she believed in Scottish independence, her starting point in these discussions was to protect Scotland's relationship with the EU.&lt;ref&gt;

Sturgeon was planning to meet with EU leaders in Brussels to discuss Scotland remaining in the EU. However, [[Donald Tusk]], President of the European Council, said that such discussions would be "not appropriate" considering the "situation in the UK".&lt;ref name="johnson1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Simon |date=28 June 2016 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/28/nicola-sturgeon-heading-to-brussels-for-talks-with-european-parl/ |title=Nicola Sturgeon snubbed by EU member states including Germany |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=London, UK |access-date=28 June 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628132659/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/28/nicola-sturgeon-heading-to-brussels-for-talks-with-european-parl/ |archivedate=28 June 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, she was able to arrange for a meeting on 29 June with European Parliament President [[Martin Schulz]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36645355 |title=Sturgeon sets up expert group to advise on aftermath of Brexit vote |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=28 June 2016 |website=BBC News – Scotland Politics |publisher=BBC |access-date=28 June 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630005249/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36645355 |archivedate=30 June 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Sturgeon said the reception had been "sympathetic", but she conceded that she did not underestimate the challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36656980 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Brexit: Spain and France oppose Scotland EU talks |date=29 June 2016 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |access-date=29 June 2016 |quote=The French president and Spanish prime minister have both said they are opposed to the EU negotiating potential membership for Scotland. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630233857/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36656980 |archivedate=30 June 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:First Minister meets the Prime Minister at Bute House.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sturgeon welcomes British Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] to [[Bute House]], 2016]]

Sturgeon met with new UK Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] in Edinburgh on 15 July 2016 after the latter had made it clear that UK unity was a high priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Heather |date=14 July 2016 |title=Theresa May's decisive reshuffle draws line under Cameron era |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/theresa-mays-decisive-reshuffle-draws-line-under-cameron-era |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |access-date=15 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160714203907/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/theresa-mays-decisive-reshuffle-draws-line-under-cameron-era |archivedate=14 July 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Sturgeon said that "It would be inconceivable for any prime minister to seek to stand in the way of a referendum if that is what the Scottish Parliament voted for ... if there's a clear sense that that's what people in Scotland want, would be completely the wrong thing to do." She added a conciliatory note, however in her assessment of May: "She's a woman who has a fairly businesslike way of doing things, which I have too. So I think we can find a way of working together, notwithstanding those disagreements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36800536 |title=Theresa May and Nicola Sturgeon meet for Brexit talks |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=15 July 2016 |website=BBC News – Scotland Politics |publisher=BBC |access-date=15 July 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160715220121/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36800536 |archivedate=15 July 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Future referendum on independence====

Sturgeon confirmed in June 2016 that the Scottish government has formally agreed to draft legislation to allow a second independence referendum to take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36631738|title=EU referendum: The 'stark difference' between Wales and Scotland|publisher=BBC News|date=25 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160628182427/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36631738|archivedate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the constitution is a 'reserved' matter under the [[Scotland Act 1998]], for a future referendum on Scottish independence to be binding under UK law, it would need to receive the consent of the British Parliament to take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/contents|title=Scotland Act 1998|last=|first=|date=|website=Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=|access-date=25 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629003653/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/contents|archivedate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 2016 Sturgeon made it clear that her motion to begin discussions with the EU (for Scotland to remain in the [[European Union]]) did not constitute a proposal for a second referendum on independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Press Association&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Nicola Sturgeon says independence vote would be proposed ‘if best or only way to protect EU place’ |url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/politics/scottish-politics/215192/nicola-sturgeon-says-independence-vote-proposed-best-way-protect-eu-place/ |newspaper=The Courier |location=Dundee, Scotland |date=28 June 2016 |access-date=28 June 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629154441/https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/politics/scottish-politics/215192/nicola-sturgeon-says-independence-vote-proposed-best-way-protect-eu-place/ |archivedate=29 June 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, her statements indicated that she had parliamentary authority to explore "options" for keeping Scotland in the EU, "including independence".&lt;ref name="johnson1"/&gt; By 13 October 2016, she announced the first formal step towards launching a new referendum, called the "Independence Referendum Bill".&lt;ref name="bbc13octobersnpsnicolasturgeonannounces"&gt;{{cite news|title=SNP's Nicola Sturgeon announces new independence referendum bill|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37634338|accessdate=13 October 2016|work=BBC|date=13 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013080947/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37634338|archivedate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the day the Prime Minister triggered [[Article 50]], formally allowing the process of the United Kingdom leaving the [[European Union]], the [[Scottish Parliament]] voted 69 to 59 in favour of another independence referendum,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/28/scottish-parliament-votes-for-second-independence-referendum-nicola-sturgeon|title=Scottish parliament votes for second independence referendum|last=editor|first=Severin Carrell Scotland|date=28 March 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=6 April 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406103856/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/28/scottish-parliament-votes-for-second-independence-referendum-nicola-sturgeon|archivedate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; formally giving Sturgeon the legal mandate to write to Theresa May to allow another referendum to take place.

====European Union membership====
[[File:FM meets with Juncker.jpg|thumb|left|Sturgeon meets with [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], [[President of the European Commission]] in 2016 to discuss Brexit]]
Following the 2016 UK referendum on the exiting the European Union, Sturgeon has called for Scotland's place in the European single market to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ashley Cowburn (Political Correspondent) |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nicola-sturgeon-determined-to-protect-scotlands-place-in-eu-a7154271.html |title=Nicola Sturgeon 'determined' to protect Scotland's place in EU |publisher=The Independent |date=25 July 2016 |accessdate=28 March 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313044537/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nicola-sturgeon-determined-to-protect-scotlands-place-in-eu-a7154271.html |archivedate=13 March 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the UK-wide vote for the United Kingdom to leave the [[European Union]], the [[Scottish Government]], headed by Sturgeon, launched the ''Scotland's Place in Europe'' document, a white paper setting out the Scottish Government's aims and wishes of Scotland's role in Europe post-Brexit. The paper was sent to the central [[British Government]] to be read by Prime Minister [[Theresa May]]. ''Scotland's Place in Europe'' was the first post-Brexit strategy by any government in the British isles, including the central UK Government who pushed ahead to hold the vote in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.gov.scot/news/scotlands-place-in-europe-4 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804162126/https://news.gov.scot/news/scotlands-place-in-europe-4 |archivedate=4 August 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document, published in December 2016, seeks for Scotland to remain a member of the European Single Market to allow the [[Economy of Scotland]] to benefit from free trade deals across the remaining 27 European Union nations. Furthermore, it seeks that remaining within the European Single Market would be beneficial for trade across the entire United Kingdom, whereby it benefits the economies of both Scotland and the United Kingdom as well as benefiting the wider economy and trade of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2016/12/9234 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603233918/http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2016/12/9234 |archivedate=3 June 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within ''Scotland's Place in Europe'', the Scottish Government highlights that there are several ways that Scotland could retain its membership of the European Single Market, but most notably by becoming an independent sovereign country within the EU which is the preferred option of Sturgeon and the wider SNP led-Scottish Government.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38379916 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120174020/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38379916 |archivedate=20 January 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than trade and single market membership, Sturgeon advocates the importance of the rights of EU nationals currently working and residing within Scotland and that there rights and liberties are protected post-Brexit.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; As immigration and border controls remain a reserved matter,&lt;ref name="parliament.scot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/Education/18642.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722092046/http://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/Education/18642.aspx |archivedate=22 July 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sturgeon has called on strong working with Prime Minister Theresa May and the UK Government to ensure this is achieved. Other issues set in the document include protection over laws and legislation which affects Scotland, protection of worker's rights and entitlements, a review of the devolution settlement in Scotland that will be affected by Brexit such as farming and fishery industries and additional powers granted to Scotland to protect and promote Scottish interests.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Recently, Sturgeon has advocated for a second independence referendum to be held at the end of the Brexit process which is expected around 2019, claiming that there is "too much at stake for Scotland for the Brexit process to be imposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nicola-sturgeon-snp-second-independence-referendum-brexit-scotland-election-2017-manifesto-a7762816.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918115045/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nicola-sturgeon-snp-second-independence-referendum-brexit-scotland-election-2017-manifesto-a7762816.html |archivedate=18 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;". A week prior to the Brexit negotiations beginning between the UK Government, 27 EU member state governments and the [[European Commission]], Sturgeon called on Prime Minister Theresa May to "pause" Brexit negotiations to allow for the creation of a four way government approach to Brexit involving the [[Northern Ireland Executive]], [[Welsh Government]], UK Government and Scottish Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/12/nicola-sturgeon-calls-for-may-to-pause-brexit-negotiations |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708062503/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/12/nicola-sturgeon-calls-for-may-to-pause-brexit-negotiations |archivedate=8 July 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Sturgeon criticised the approaches taken by both Theresa May and the British Government towards the Brexit approach, claiming that May "will struggle" as she is a "difficult person to build a rapport with". In the same interview, Sturgeon committed to no independence referendum being held prior to the terms of a UK wide Brexit deal being agreed and presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/06/nicola-sturgeon-says-difficult-theresa-may-will-struggle-with-brexit-talks |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714061853/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/06/nicola-sturgeon-says-difficult-theresa-may-will-struggle-with-brexit-talks |archivedate=14 July 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nicola Sturgeon addresses journalists over Brexit.jpg|thumb|right|Sturgeon addresses journalists over Brexit at [[Bute House]]]]

Along with First Minister of Wales Carwyn Jones, Sturgeon criticised in a statement the Brexit repeal bill to convert EU law into British law as a "power grab", because the bill "does not return powers from the EU to the devolved administrations, as promised" but "returns them solely to the UK government and parliament, and imposes new restrictions on the [[Scottish Parliament]] and [[National Assembly for Wales]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-40586269|title=Sturgeon: EU repeal bill a 'power grab'|date=13 July 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=14 September 2017|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914222912/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-40586269|archivedate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fears were reiterated in September, when the Scottsh devolved government recommened its Parliament to withhold its consent for the bill. Scotland and Wales are expected to propose amendments to the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-scotland/scottish-government-recommends-rejection-of-eu-withdrawal-bill-idUKKCN1BN1PL|title=Scottish government recommends rejection of EU withdrawal bill|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.K.|access-date=14 September 2017|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913175751/http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-scotland/scottish-government-recommends-rejection-of-eu-withdrawal-bill-idUKKCN1BN1PL|archivedate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a view towards Brexit, Sturgeon demanded greater powers for the Scottish Parliament, arguing that Brexit is threatening Scotland's [[Scottish devolution settlement|devolution settlement]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/nicola-sturgeon-calls-for-united-front-to-protect-devolution-1-4556755|title=Nicola Sturgeon calls for united front to protect devolution|website=www.scotsman.com|language=en|access-date=14 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912131031/http://www.scotsman.com/news/nicola-sturgeon-calls-for-united-front-to-protect-devolution-1-4556755|archivedate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With London seeking to restrict immigration to the United Kingdom, she asserted that Scotland should be able to set its own immigration policy, as well as policies relating to employment and trade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Scottish local elections, 2017====
{{Main|Scottish local elections, 2017}}
Sturgeon and the SNP went into the Scottish council elections that were held on 4 May 2017, as the largest political party in the 32 local council areas in Scotland, having 424 councillors elected to serve on the councils across Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/vote2012/council/scotland.stm|title=BBC News – Vote 2012 – Scottish Council Results|website=BBC News|accessdate=28 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506180240/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/vote2012/council/scotland.stm|archivedate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opinion polling for the council elections conducted in early 2017 suggested that the SNP looked set to repeat this level of success, with 47% of the public claiming they will be voting for SNP candidates on election day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/labour-set-for-heavy-defeat-in-scottish-council-elections-poll-1-4366511|title=Labour set for heavy defeat in Scottish council elections – poll|website=www.scotsman.com|accessdate=28 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001214004/http://www.scotsman.com/news/labour-set-for-heavy-defeat-in-scottish-council-elections-poll-1-4366511|archivedate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Publicly speaking about the 2017 Scottish council elections, Sturgeon has said that the elections were a clear choice between voting for herself and [[Ruth Davidson]], the leader of the [[Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party]], citing the stark fall in support of the [[Scottish Labour Party]] and their leader [[Kezia Dugdale]] over the past several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/15237638.Sturgeon__Council_elections_a_choice_between_SNP_and_Tories/|title=Sturgeon: Council elections a choice between SNP and Tories|website=HeraldScotland|accessdate=28 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430030051/http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/15237638.Sturgeon__Council_elections_a_choice_between_SNP_and_Tories/|archivedate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the engagement in June 2016, Sturgeon highlighted the concerns raised in Scotland by the Brexit vote and claimed that Scotland's desire to remain within the European Union was met with "sympathy" from Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://firstminister.gov.scot/3181-2/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010004559/https://firstminister.gov.scot/3181-2/ |archivedate=10 October 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Catalonian independence referendum, 2017====

In the run up to the [[Catalan independence referendum, 2017]], Nicola Sturgeon offered her own personal backing and that of the [[Scottish Government]] to [[Catalonia]] in the holding of a democratic and fair independence referendum, stating that "self determination was an important principle".&lt;ref name="Archived copy"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-41350999 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005050053/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-41350999 |archivedate=5 October 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of Spain has criticised Sturgeon for her comments and intervention to the independence movement in Catalonia, claiming that Sturgeon had "totally misunderstood" the situation in Spain and Catalonia.&lt;ref name="Archived copy"/&gt; In response to the mass police attacks and violence against Catalans on polling day, Sturgeon expressed her personal concern over the situation in Catalonia and the response shown by the Spanish Government and the Spanish police, claiming that all should condemn the violence taking place "regardless of their views on independence" and that the central Spanish Government in [[Madrid]] should allow the polling to take place before "someone gets hurt" as a result of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-41453955 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116215619/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-41453955 |archivedate=16 November 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
[[File:Sturgeon addresses the United Nations, 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Sturgeon delivering a speech at the [[United Nations]] in New York City]]
In the run up to the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, then [[President of the United States]] [[Barack Obama]] offered his support to the [[Better Together (campaign)|Better Together]] side, claiming that the United Kingdom was better united, with Scotland remaining within it. There was much speculation that Obama's last minute intervention in the referendum debate and offering his support to a "strong, robust and united" United Kingdom was due to concerns in [[Washington D.C.]] that one of the United States' closest allies could separate and weaken the relation between the United States and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/11103256/Barack-Obama-tells-Scotland-stay-united.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004015921/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scottish-independence/11103256/Barack-Obama-tells-Scotland-stay-united.html |archivedate=4 October 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sturgeon was highly critical of Obama's intervention in the debate, claiming that his intervention "helped" boost the number of votes [[Yes Scotland]] received. Sturgeon claimed she was not "sore" about the intervention shown by Barack Obama, but his claim about a strong United Kingdom had a "strange" impact on Scots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nicola-sturgeon/11664708/Nicola-Sturgeon-Obamas-referendum-plea-backfired.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004015906/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nicola-sturgeon/11664708/Nicola-Sturgeon-Obamas-referendum-plea-backfired.html |archivedate=4 October 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sturgeon was highly critical of [[Donald Trump]] during the [[United States presidential election, 2016]] and had publicly backed his [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] rival [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/nicola-sturgeon-backs-hillary-president-9204999 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001214420/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/nicola-sturgeon-backs-hillary-president-9204999 |archivedate=1 October 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sturgeon had been highly critical of Donald Trump and his policies, highlighting her disapproval of his language and views relating to sexism and misogyny, and stating upon Trump's victory that she hopes "Trump turns out to be a president different to the one he was during his campaign and reaches out to those who felt vilified by his campaign".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-37940485 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123083406/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-37940485 |archivedate=23 January 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Trump's victory during the Presidential election, Sturgeon and Trump spoke on the phone to discuss the future relationship and diplomatic approaches between both the United States and Scotland with Sturgeon offering her well wishes to Trump following his success. Sturgeon highlighted that "Scotland and the United States will continue to cooperate in those areas where we share common interests and goals, and when appropriate we will also look to have constructive dialogue on issues where our views differ".&lt;ref name="stv.tv"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://stv.tv/news/politics/1378606-nicola-sturgeon-congratulates-donald-trump-on-inauguration/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001213437/https://stv.tv/news/politics/1378606-nicola-sturgeon-congratulates-donald-trump-on-inauguration/ |archivedate=1 October 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sturgeon had also previously stripped Donald Trump of his ambassadorial role for Scottish businesses with the Scottish Government in the aftermath of Trump's views of an outright ban of [[Muslims]] from entering the United States. Sturgeon claimed following comments made by Trump in relation to Muslims entering the United States that he was "not fit" for the ambassadorial role with the Scottish Government.&lt;ref name="stv.tv"/&gt;

====Spain====

[[Spain]] and its former [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]] [[Mariano Rajoy]] had always been highly critical and against the idea of an independent Scotland, with Rajoy always claiming that Scotland would be "outside" of the [[European Union]] should it have voted for independence from the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-25132026 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 November 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128173756/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-25132026 |archivedate=28 November 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the Scottish Government and Sturgeon had argued that due to being a current member of the European Union as part of the United Kingdom that Scotland would be granted automatic entry as it jointed the European Union as part of the United Kingdom in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/resource/0043/00439021.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 April 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427124745/http://www.gov.scot/resource/0043/00439021.pdf |archivedate=27 April 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Spain had always doubted that theory and viewpoint of the Scottish Government, claiming that Scotland would be waiting a number of years to gain entry to the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/17/spain-independent-scotland-years-eu-membership |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001213716/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/17/spain-independent-scotland-years-eu-membership |archivedate=1 October 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the United Kingdom's decision to withdraw its membership of the European Union, Prime Minister Rajoy once again was critical of the views taken by the Scottish Government when he rejected calls from Sturgeon for Scotland to remain within the European Single Market. The Spanish Secretary of State to the European Union, Jorge Toledo, claimed that "if the United Kingdom leaves the single market then the whole United Kingdom leaves the single market" going onto claim further that there is only "one negotiator that is the UK Government&lt;ref name="holyrood.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.holyrood.com/articles/news/spain-rejects-nicola-sturgeons-plan-scotland-stay-single-market |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002024841/https://www.holyrood.com/articles/news/spain-rejects-nicola-sturgeons-plan-scotland-stay-single-market |archivedate=2 October 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;". Mariano Rajoy told the meeting of the [[European Council]] that he was block any independent and separate deal put forward by Sturgeon and the Scottish Government.&lt;ref name="holyrood.com"/&gt;

[[File:Nicola Sturgeon meets with Niels Annan, German Minister, 2018.jpg|thumb|right|Sturgeon meets with [[Niels Annen]], [[Minister of State]] at the German [[Federal Foreign Office]], June 2018]]

Sturgeon has been highly critical of the Spanish Governments actions and the way it has dealt with the affairs relating to the Catalan independence referendum held in October 2017, highlighting to Mariano Rajoy that instead he should follow "the shining example" that was created as part of the [[Edinburgh Agreement (2012)|Edinburgh Agreement]] between the Scottish and British Governments that allowed Scotland to hold a legally binding referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/15554327.Iain_Macwhirter__Madrid_should_have_learned_the_lesson_of_the_Scottish_independence_referendum/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002022033/http://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/15554327.Iain_Macwhirter__Madrid_should_have_learned_the_lesson_of_the_Scottish_independence_referendum/ |archivedate=2 October 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====

In 2016, it was announced by Sturgeon that she would be opening a Scottish embassy in Germany to strengthen international relations between both [[Germany]] and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/14/nicola-sturgeon-to-open-german-embassy-because-she-does-not-trus/&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, Sturgeon travelled to [[Berlin]] with representatives from twelve Scottish based companies on a trade delegation to promote inwards investment in Scotland and to promote and strengthen trading connections with Germany. Sturgeon also met with [[Niels Annen]], [[Minister of State]] of the [[Federal Foreign Office]], marking the first meeting between the Scottish Government and the new German Government which was elected under the [[Fourth Merkel cabinet]] in March 2018. Furthermore, Sturgeon met with [[Michael Müller (politician)|Michael Müller]], the [[Governing Mayor of Berlin]] to discuss the future cooperation around the [[2018 European Championships]], being held in Glasgow and Berlin in August.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-44592877&lt;/ref&gt;

====Republic of Ireland====
[[File:Nicola Sturgeon meets with Michael Higgins, President of Ireland.jpg|thumb|left|Sturgeon meets Irish President [[Michael D. Higgins]]]]
As First Minister, Sturgeon has endured a long-standing relationship with the [[Republic of Ireland]] and the [[Government of Ireland]], meeting regularly with both [[Taoiseach]] [[Enda Kenny]] and his successor, [[Leo Varadkar]]. Sturgeon claims that the relationship between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland is "more important than ever", with Sturgeon completing numerous trips to the Republic of Ireland to continue to promote Scottish trade and business, cultural and economic ties between the Republic of Ireland and Scotland, as well as strengthening Irish-Scottish relations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/republic-of-ireland/nicola-sturgeon-ties-between-scotland-and-ireland-more-important-than-ever-36197281.html&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[British-Irish Council]], members of both the Scottish Government and Government of Ireland meet regularly to discuss and agree on areas of mutual concern and interest relating to the [[British Isles]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britishirishcouncil.org/about-council&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Sturgeon was invited to address the [[Seanad Éireann]], the upper house of the Parliament of the Republic of Ireland, making her the first serving head of government in the world to address the Seanad Éireann.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-37952259&lt;/ref&gt; Sturgeon used her speech of the parliament to highlight the "long tradition of co-operation" between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, stating that this was "even more important" since the British vote to withdraw from the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt; During the same visit, Sturgeon met [[President of Ireland]] [[Michael D. Higgins]] along with [[Charles Flanagan]], the minister for foreign affairs, during her visit to [[Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;President Michael Higgins and Charles Flanagan, the minister for foreign affairs, during her visit to Dublin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the decision to leave the European Union, Sturgeon has endured a strong relationship with the Republic of Ireland to ensure a strong Scottish deal and to explore options relating to trade can continue once the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. In June 2018, Sturgeon, Varadkar and [[First Minister of Wales]] [[Carwyn Jones]] held an emergency summit in the [[Channel Islands]] where Varadkar highlighted that the Republic of Ireland was preparing for a "no deal Brexit". In response, both Sturgeon and Jones issued a joint ministerial statement to put pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May to reconsider her stance on withdrawing the United Kingdom from the EU Customs Union.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/978163/Brexit-news-ireland-leo-varadkar-nicola-sturgeon-scotland-carwyn-jones-wales&lt;/ref&gt;

Sturgeon is noted for campaigning for [[women's rights]] and [[gender equality]], and is a self-described [[feminism|feminist]]; she has argued that Scotland's feminist movement is not simply symbolic, but "sends a powerful signal about equality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/30/post-referendum-scotland-feminist-paradise |title=Is post-referendum Scotland a feminist paradise? |work=The Guardian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221150909/https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/sep/30/post-referendum-scotland-feminist-paradise |archivedate=21 December 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has hailed Scottish feminist economist [[Ailsa McKay]] as one of her inspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beaton|first=Connor|title= Economics professor passes after cancer battle|work=The Targe|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Woman's Hour|BBC's Women's Hour]], Sturgeon revealed that it was [[Margaret Thatcher]] that inspired her to enter politics, because, due to rising unemployment in Scotland at the time, she developed "a strong feeling that it was wrong for Scotland to be governed by a Tory government that we hadn't elected".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-25333635|title=The Nicola Sturgeon story|last=Sim|first=Philip|date=26 May 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=14 September 2017|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915002848/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-25333635|archivedate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Osteolathyrism''' is a [[collagen]] cross-linking [[Deficiency (medicine)|deficiency]] brought on by dietary over-reliance on the seeds of ''[[Lathyrus sativus]]'' or grass pea, a legume often grown as a [[famine crop]] in [[Asia]] and [[East Africa]].&lt;ref name=Rosenthal&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenthal|first=Gerald|title=Plant Nonprotein Amino and Imino Acids: Biological, Biochemical, and Toxicological Properties|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780323157742|chapter=Toxic Constituents and their Related Metabolites|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other members of the genus are also known to cause the disease, including ''[[Lathyrus sylvestris|L. sylvestris]]'', ''[[Lathyrus cicera|L. cicera]]'', and ''[[Lathyrus clymenum|L. clymenum]]''.&lt;ref name=Rosenthal /&gt; ''L. sativus'' grows well under famine conditions, often severe drought, where it is cultivated.&lt;ref name=Rosenthal /&gt;  The condition results in damage to [[bone]] and [[mesenchyme|mesenchymal connective tissues]].&lt;ref name=Rosenthal /&gt; It is seen in [[human|people]] in combination with [[neurolathyrism]] and [[angiolathyrism]] in areas where [[famine]] demands reliance on a [[crop]] with known detrimental effects. It occurs in [[cattle]] and [[horse]]s with diets overreliant upon the grass pea.  Osteolathyrism is caused by a variety of osteolathyrogenic compounds, specifically excitatory amino-compounds.  The most widely-studied of these compounds is [[beta-aminopropionitrile]] (BAPN), which exerts its deleterious effect by an unknown yet potently irreversible mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmarth KR, Froines JR (November 1992). "''In Vitro'' and ''In Vivo'' Inhibition of Lysyl Oxidase by Aminopropionitriles".  ''Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health'' 37 (3): 411-423&lt;/ref&gt; Other instigators are [[ureide]]s, [[semicarbazide]]s and [[thiosemicarbazide]]s, which are believed to [[chelate]] the prosthetic [[copper|Cu(II)]]-[[bipyridine]] [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] complex in the [[enzyme]] [[lysyl oxidase]].&lt;ref&gt;Dawson DA, Rinaldi AC, Poch G (August 2002). "Biochemical and toxicological evaluation of agent-cofactor reactivity as a mechanism of action for osteolathyrism". ''Toxicology'' 177 (2-3): 267-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Lysyl oxidase is an important enzyme for the creation of crosslinks between [[collagen]] triple-helices in [[connective tissue]].  By [[oxidation|oxidizing]] the terminal [[amino group]] of [[lysine]], an [[aldehyde]] is created.  This aldehyde can undergo several reactions with neighboring aldehydes or [[amine]]s to create strong [[covalent]] cross-links between collagen [[tertiary structure]]s in [[bone]] and [[cartilage]].  The main product of these reactions is the [[aldimine]] compound [[dehydrohydroxylysinonorleucine]].&lt;ref&gt;Bailey AJ, Peach CM (1971). "The Chemistry of the Collagen Cross-Links: The Absence of Reduction of Dehydrolysinonorleucine and Dehydrohydroxylysinonorleucine ''in Vivo''". ''The Biochemical Journal'' 121: 257-259.&lt;/ref&gt;  This unique crosslink can be formed by the [[Schiff base]] mechanism in which the lone pair of [[electron]]s on a [[primary amine]] react with the [[carbonyl]] carbon of an aldehyde.  Other crosslinks include the formation of an α,β-[[saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] [[ketone]] via [[aldol condensation]] and hydroxylysinonorleucine.  

If these crosslinks are not formed, as in the case of osteolathyrism, the synthesis of strong [[mesenchymal]] and [[mesodermal]] tissue is inhibited.  Symptoms of osteolathyrism include weakness and fragility of connective tissue (i.e., skin, bones, and blood vessels ([[angiolathyrism]]) and the [[paralysis]] of the lower extremities associated with neurolathyrism.  For these reasons, compounds containing lathyrogens should be avoided during [[pregnancy]] and growth of a [[child]].

'''Penile plethysmography''' ('''PPG''') or '''phallometry''' is measurement of [[blood]]flow to the [[human penis|penis]], typically used as a proxy for measurement of [[sexual arousal]]. The most commonly reported methods of conducting penile plethysmography involve the measurement of the circumference of the penis with a mercury-in-rubber or electromechanical [[strain gauge]], or the volume of the penis with an airtight cylinder and inflatable cuff at the base of the penis. [[Corpus cavernosum penis|Corpora cavernosa]] nerve penile plethysmographs measure changes in response to inter-operative electric stimulation during surgery. The volumetric procedure was invented by [[Kurt Freund]] and is considered to be particularly sensitive at low arousal levels. The easier to use circumferential measures are more widely used, however, and more common in studies using [[erotic film]] stimuli. A corresponding device in women is the [[vaginal photoplethysmograph]].&lt;ref&gt;Prause, Nicole, and Erick Janssen. "Blood flow: Vaginal photoplethysmography." Women’s sexual function and dysfunction: Study, diagnosis, and treatment (2006): 359-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

For sexual offenders it is typically used to determine the level of sexual arousal as the subject is exposed to sexually suggestive content, such as pictures, movies or audio, although some have argued that phallometry is not always appropriate for the evaluation of sexual preferences or treatment effects.&lt;ref name="simon"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Simon W.

G. | year = 1992 | title = The plethysmograph reconsidered: Comments on Barker and Howell | url = | journal = Bulletin of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 13–25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1998 large-scale meta-analytic review of the scientific reports demonstrated that phallometric response to stimuli depicting children, though only 32% accurate, had the highest accuracy among methods of identifying which sexual offenders will go on to commit new sexual crimes.&lt;ref name = Hanson1998&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hanson R.

For [[prostatectomy]] [[nerve-sparing surgery]], the surgeon applies a mild electrical stimulation near the [[cavernous nerves of penis]] to verify their locations and avoid operative trauma. Damage to these difficult-to-see nerves can cause [[erectile dysfunction]] outcomes. At the surgery's conclusion, the electrical stimulation penile plethysmograph result is a [[prognosis]] which helps to manage the erectile function outcomes earlier than the many months required for recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Klotz L, Heaton J, Jewett M, etal |title=A randomized phase 3 study of intraoperative cavernosa nerve stimulation with penile tumescence monitoring to improve nerve sparing during radical prostatectomy |journal=J.

==Types==
There are two types of penile plethysmograph:

*Volumetric air chamber
:When this is placed over the subject's penis, as [[tumescence]] increases, the air displaced is measured.
*Circumferential transducer
:This uses a mercury-in-rubber or indium/gallium-in-rubber ring or electromechanical [[strain gauge]] and is placed around the shaft of the subject's penis to measure changes in circumference.

The circumferential type is more common,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Howes R. J. | year = 1995 | title = A survey of plethysmographic assessment in North America | url = | journal = Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 9–24 | doi=10.1007/bf02254871}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the volumetric method is believed to be more accurate at low arousal levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuban M, Barbaree HE, Blanchard R |title=A comparison of volume and circumference phallometry: response magnitude and method agreement |journal=Arch Sex Behav |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=345–59 |date=August 1999 |pmid=10553495 |doi= 10.1023/A:1018700813140|url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0004-0002&amp;volume=28&amp;page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant suppliers of PPG machines include Behavioral Technology Inc. and Medical Monitoring Systems. The device is known to be used in [[Brazil]], [[UK|Britain]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Hong Kong]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Slovak Republic]], [[Spain]], and the [[United States]].

The surgical machine is supplied as CaverMap by Blue Torch Medical Technology, Inc.

A roughly equivalent procedure for women, [[vaginal photoplethysmograph]]y, measures blood through the walls of the [[vagina]], which researchers claim increases during sexual arousal.

==History==
The original volumetric was developed during the 1950s by [[Kurt Freund]] in then-[[Czechoslovakia]]. Freund later wrote, "In the early fifties homosexual interaction was still an indictable offense in Czechoslovakia. I was of course opposed to this measure, but I still thought, as did my colleagues at the psychiatric university hospital in Prague where I was working, that homosexuality was an experientially acquired neurosis". He then developed phallometry to replace [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] methods of assessment because "[P]sychoanalysis had turned out to be a failure, virtually unusable as an instrument for individual diagnosis or research....When phallometry began to look promising as a test of erotic sex and age preferences, we started using it mainly as a test of [[pedophilia]], that is determining who has an erotic preference for children over adults".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Freund K | year = 1991 | title = Reflections on the development of the phallometric method of assessing sexual preference | url = | journal = Annals of Sex Research | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 221–228 | doi = 10.1007/BF00850054 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In post–World War II Czechoslovakia, Freund was assigned by the communist government the task of identifying among military conscripts men who were falsely declaring themselves to be gay to avoid the draft.&lt;ref name = wilson2006&gt;Wilson, R. J., &amp; Mathon, H. F. (2006, fall). Remembering Kurt Freund (1914-1996). ''ATSA Forum.''

==Reliability and validity==
In 1994, the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (Fourth Edition) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] stated that penile plethysmography has been used in research settings to assess various paraphilias by measuring an individual's sexual arousal in response to visual and auditory stimuli. The reliability and validity of this procedure in clinical assessment have not been well established, and clinical experience suggests that subjects can simulate response by manipulating mental images."&lt;ref name="dsmiv"&gt;DSM-IV, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, a recent meta-analysis provides support for the validity of phallometric testing as a measure of sexual interests in children across 37 samples and 6,785 individuals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McPhail|first=Ian V.|last2=Hermann|first2=Chantal A.|last3=Fernane|first3=Stephanie|last4=Fernandez|first4=Yolanda M.|last5=Nunes|first5=Kevin L.|last6=Cantor|first6=James M.|title=Validity in Phallometric Testing for Sexual Interests in Children: A Meta-Analytic Review|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1073191117706139|journal=Assessment|language=en|doi=10.1177/1073191117706139|year=2017|page=107319111770613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Hanson and Bussière published a comprehensive meta-analysis of 61 scientific reports on the prediction of sexual offenses spanning more than 40,000 individual cases. They ascertained that of all the methods attempted and reported, penile phethysmographic responses to imagery depicting [[children]] was the single most accurate predictor of sexual re-offense across 7 studies reporting data from phallometric testing.&lt;ref name = Hanson1998/&gt; Another meta-analysis in 2005 of 13 studies and 2,180 individual cases repeated the finding that phallometric responses to children was a strong predictor of sexual re-offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hanson R.

A more recent meta-analysis that included 16 samples and 2,709 sexual offenders replicated and extended the previous findings that phallometric responding to children is a predictor of sexual re-offence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This meta-analysis extended previous meta-analytic research by showing phallometric responding to both male and female pedophilic and [[Hebephilia|hebephilic]] stimuli predict sexual re-offence.   Further, this meta-analysis showed that phallometric testing predicts sexual re-offence in distinct subgroups of sexual offenders against children.

===Critique of methodological problems===
There are criticisms of the methodology used to determine the reliability and specificity of penile plethysmography. One such criticism is that while penile plethysmography is said to be important for being more objective than a test subject’s subjective reports on sexual arousal, the argument for penile plethysmography being a more reliable gauge of sexual arousal than vaginal plethysmography is still that there is a higher correspondence on average between what the test subjects report and what the instruments observe in male subjects than in female subjects. There is a criticism of this discrepancy for lacking consistency in the standards of whether or not subjective reports are useful. There is also criticism regarding the possibility of sampling bias being greater in male subjects of penile plethysmography than in female subjects of vaginal plethysmography, males being generally more aware of their physical sexual responses than females in most cultures may cause the male volunteers to be almost exclusively individuals who have category specific erections due to those with nonspecific erections fearing erection in taboo contexts and therefore not signing up for the studies. This effect may explain apparent male specificity as a result of methodological bias. The difference between tests of volunteers and tests of convicted or suspected sex offenders in penile plethysmography results may be caused by the sex offender group often effectively lacking the choice not to volunteer, without difference in erection patterns from the average population. One criticism of reoffending studies is that cultural attitudes that assume that men are sexually attracted to what they phallometrically respond to may cause men with no actual sexual interest in children to identify as pedophiles due to knowing that they phallometrically respond to them, making them more likely to be convicted again.&lt;ref&gt;Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology, Scott O. Lilienfeld, Steven Jay Lynn, Jeffrey M. Lohr 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;At the Fringes of Science, 1998, Michael W. Friedlander&lt;/ref&gt;

==Utility==

=== Erectile dysfunction ===

==== Volumetric penile plethysmography ====
In one study, 21% of the subjects were excluded for various reasons, including "the subject's erotic age-preference was uncertain and his phallometrically diagnosed sex-preference was the same as his verbal claim" and attempts to influence the outcome of the test.&lt;ref name="57-1-100"/&gt; This study found the sensitivity for identifying pedohebephilia in sexual offenders against children admitting to this interest to be 100%.  In addition, the sensitivity for this phallometric test in partially admitting sexual offenders against children was found to be 77% and for denying sexual offenders against children to be 58%.  The specificity of this volumetric phallometric test for pedohebephilia was estimated to be 95%.

Further studies by Freund have estimated the sensitivity of a volumetric test for pedohebephilia to be 35% for sexual offenders against children with a single female victim, 70% for those with two or more female victims, 77% for those offenders with one male victim, and 84% for those with two or more male victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freund|first1=K.|last2=Watson|first2=R.

In a similar study, the sensitivity of a volumetric test for pedophilia to be 62% for sexual offenders against children with a single female victim, 90% for those with two or more female victims, 76% for those offenders with one male victim, and 95% for those with two or more male victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freund|first1=K.|last2=Watson|first2=R.

Another study examined the possibility that juvenile sex offenders might be able to suppress arousal deemed deviant.  Of the juveniles who exhibited sexual arousal, categorization was made into two age appropriate categories—Adult and Peer responders—and three age inappropriate categories—Child, Child/Adult, and Nondiscriminating responders—based on whether they had the greatest sexual arousal in response to adult female, peer female, or younger child female stimuli.  Sexual arousal in response to older adult women or peers was deemed age appropriate;  sexual arousal in response to significantly younger females was deemed inappropriate.  Many of the juveniles who denied responsibility for their offenses showed no sexual arousal at all—however about one-third still showed age inappropriate arousal despite denying responsibility for their offenses.&lt;ref name="23-1-87"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Becker J.V. |author2=Kaplan M |author3=Tenke C |title=The Relationship of Abuse History, Denial and Erectile Response Profiles of Adolescent Sexual Perpetrators |journal=Behavior Therapy |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=87–97 |date=Winter 1992 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005789405803107 |doi=10.1016/s0005-7894(05)80310-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-dressing===
Phallometry might distinguish men with erotic interests in [[cross-dressing]] from non-cross-dressers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Buhrich N. |author2=McConaghy N. | year = 1977 | title = The discrete syndromes of transvestism and transsexualism | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 483–495 | doi=10.1007/bf01541153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Freund K. |author2=Seto M.

===Biastophilia===
There is some evidence that phallometry can distinguish groups of men with [[biastophilia]] (a [[paraphilia]] involving [[rape]]) from groups of men without it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Seto M.

==Legal admissibility==
In general, phallometric test results are employed as part of the sentencing and rehabilitation phase of forensic systems, but ''not'' for determining whether a specific defendant is guilty of any specific offense against any specific person.

=== United States ===

====Use as trial evidence====
In the [[United States]], a scientific technique could not be used as evidence in court unless the technique was "generally accepted" as reliable in the relevant scientific community. This was known as the [[Frye standard]], adopted in 1923. In 1993, the doctrine was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in favor of a more comprehensive "reliable foundation" test in ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals]]''. In the [[Daubert standard]], the "generally accepted" test was no longer determinative. Several other factors could now be considered, including whether the technique had been published and peer reviewed. Myers notes, "Courts that have considered penile plethysmography generally rule that the technique is not sufficiently reliable for use in court."&lt;ref name="myers"&gt;Myers JEB (2005). ''Myers on Evidence in Child, Domestic, and Elder Abuse Cases.'' Aspen Publishers Online {{ISBN|0-7355-5668-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''United States v. Powers'' the court excluded the penile plethysmograph test because it failed to qualify under Daubert's scientific validity prong for two reasons: the scientific literature does not regard the test as a valid diagnostic tool, and "a vast majority of incest offenders who do not admit their guilt, such as Powers, show a normal reaction to the test. The Government argues that such [[false negative]]s render the test unreliable."&lt;ref name="powers"&gt;''United States v. Powers'', 59 F.3d 1460 (4th Cir. 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Barker and Howell, penile plethysmography (PPG) does not meet the legal threshold for the guilt phase for the following reasons:&lt;ref name="barker"&gt;Barker and Howell, The Plethysmograph: A Review of Recent Literature, 20 ''Bull. Am. Acad. of Psychiatry and Law'' 13 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

*No standardization
*Test results are not sufficiently accurate
*Results are subject to faking and voluntary control by test subjects

They concluded, "Until a way can be devised to detect and/or control false negatives and false positives, the validity of the test data will be questionable."&lt;ref name="barker"/&gt; Responding to Barker and Howell, Simon and Schouten noted, "Our own analysis suggests that the standardization and faking issues, as well as other problems not addressed in the Barker and Howell paper, warrant much more guarded conclusions about the use of the plethysmograph in legal and clinical settings."&lt;ref name="simon"/&gt; Prentky noted "the increased likelihood in forensic settings that dissimulation may compromise the validity of the assessment."&lt;ref name="prentky"&gt;Prentky RA, Knight RA, Lee AFS (1997) Risk factors associated with recidivism among extrafamilial child molesters. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology.''&lt;/ref&gt; Hall and Crowther noted penile plethysmography "may be even more problematic than other [methods] in assessing susceptibility of the test to faking."&lt;ref name="hall"&gt;Hall GCN, Crowther JH (1991).

In ''State of North Carolina v. Spencer'',&lt;ref name="spencer"&gt;North Carolina v. Spencer, 459 S.E.2d 812, 815 (N.C. Ct. App. 1995),&lt;/ref&gt; the court reviewed the literature and case law and concluded that penile plethysmography was scientifically unreliable: "Despite the sophistication of the current equipment technology, a question remains whether the information emitted is a valid and reliable means of assessing sexual preference."

More recently, a substantial amount of research data has been gathered and reviewed, and significant steps have been taken toward standardization.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} According to Launay (1999), "[T]he validity of the technique for research and clinical assessment is now established;"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/cbm.317 | last1 = Launay | first1 = G. | year = 1999 | title = The phallometric assessment of sex offenders: an update | url = | journal = Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 254–274 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is only the use in guilt-determination proceedings that is inappropriate.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Fedoroff and Moran called it an "experimental procedure" and noted, "Virtually every expert who has written about phallometry has cautioned that it is insufficiently sensitive or specific to be used to determine the guilt or innocence of a person accused of a sex crime."&lt;ref name="fedoroff"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fedoroff | first1 = JP | last2 = Moran | first2 = B | year = 1997 | title = Myths and Misconceptions about Sex Offenders | url = | journal = The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-conviction use====
Phallometry is widely considered appropriate for treatment and supervision of convicted [[Sex and the law|sex offenders]]: "Courts have permitted plethysmographic testing for monitoring compliance by convicted sex offenders with the conditions of their community placement as part of crime-related treatment for sexual deviancy."&lt;ref&gt;Sachsenmaier, S.

Weber'', 2006 U.S. App. LEXIS 15111 (9th Cir. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The device is routinely used at civil commitment facilities, but "some clinicians and offenders say it is easy, particularly in a laboratory, to stifle arousal and thus cheat on a plethysmograph test."&lt;ref name="goodnough"&gt;Goodnough A, Davey M (March 6, 2007). [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/06/us/06civil.html For Sex Offenders, a Dispute Over Therapy's Benefits.] ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; This has been reported to occur in 16% of cases.&lt;ref name="pmid11281033"/&gt;

During the [[Catholic sex abuse cases]], the reliability of the test was questioned by some officials in the [[Sexual abuse scandal in Philadelphia archdiocese|Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia]]. Later, these officials chose to seek therapy at an institution where the plethysmograph was not used.&lt;ref&gt;''Court of Common Pleas, First Judicial District of PA'', County Investigating Grand Jury, 9-17-2003
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===

Courts in [[Canada]] came to a similar conclusion as those in the United States. The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] adopted the [[Daubert standard|Daubert doctrine]] in ''R. v . J.-L.J.'' [2000] 2 S.C.R. 600, which upheld a lower court's decision to exclude testimony by a psychiatrist who had administered several tests on the accused, including a penile plethysmograph:

{{quote|A level of reliability that is quite useful in therapy because it yields some information about a course of treatment is not necessarily sufficiently reliable to be used in a court of law to identify or exclude the accused as a potential perpetrator of an offence. In fact, penile plethysmography has received a mixed reception in Quebec courts: ''Protection de la jeunesse'' – 539, [1992] R.J.Q. 1144; ''R. c. Blondin'', [1996] Q.J. No. 3605 (QL) (S.C.); L. Morin and C. Boisclair in "La preuve d'abus sexuel: allégations, déclarations et l'évaluation d'expert" (1992), 23 R.D.U.S. 27. Efforts to use penile plethysmography in the United States as proof of disposition have largely been rejected: ''People v. John W.'', 185 Cal.App.3d 801 (1986); ''Gentry v. State'', 443 S.E.2d 667 (Ga. Ct. App. 1994); ''United States v. Powers'', 59 F.3d 1460 (4th Cir. 1995); ''State v. Spencer'', 459 S.E.2d 812 (N.C. App. 1995); J. E. B.

As of 2010, all youth in sex offender treatment programs administered by the Youth Forensic Psychiatric Service of [[British Columbia]] were offered a voluntary penile plethysmograph test to predict whether they can properly control their deviant arousal, or whether they will require medication or other forms of treatment. According to sceptics, however, the test does not reliably predict recurrent violations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/07/29/adrian-macnair-b-c-government-rethinks-penis-arousal-tests/ Adrian MacNair: B.C. government rethinks penis-arousal tests (National Post, July 29, 2010)] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120711073409/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/07/29/adrian-macnair-b-c-government-rethinks-penis-arousal-tests/ |date=July 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics and legality of use===
[[Robert Todd Carroll]] writes, "More objectionable than the questionable scientific validity of the device, however, are the moral and legal questions its use raises."&lt;ref name="todd2003"&gt;Carroll, Robert Todd (2003). Penile plethysmograph (PPG). ''The skeptic's dictionary: a collection of strange beliefs, amusing deceptions, and dangerous delusions,'' pp. 278-281. John Wiley and Sons, {{ISBN|978-0-471-27242-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll and others cite the legality of the depictions of minors, as well as the constitutionality of requiring PPG for admission to jobs or the military, or in custody cases. In ''Harrington v. Almy'' the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] found that a PPG ordered to be administered by [[William O'Donohue]] as a precondition of employment was a violation of plaintiff's rights under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="harrison"&gt;''Harrington v.

The EU's leading human rights agency, the Fundamental Rights Agency, has criticised the use of phallometric tests by the Czech Republic to determine whether asylum seekers presenting themselves as homosexual were in fact gay. According to the Agency, the Czech Republic was in 2010 the only EU country to employ a sexual arousal test, which the Agency said could violate the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11954499 Czech gay asylum 'phallometric test' criticised by EU (BBC, December 8, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the [[EU commission]] issued a statement calling the Czech practice illegal, saying "The practice of phallometric tests constitutes a strong interference with the person's private life and human dignity. This kind of degrading treatment should not be accepted in the European Union, nor elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/22/32349 Czech sexuality tests not legal, EU commission says (EUobserver, 17.05.2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Czech Interior Ministry replied that the testing was conducted only after written consent has been obtained, and when it was not possible to use a different method of verification. According to the Ministry, all those who had passed the test had been granted asylum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2010/12/08/czech_republic_defends_test_of_gay_asylum_seekers_despite_eu_criticism.html Czech Republic defends test of gay asylum seekers despite EU criticism (Thestar.com, Dec 08 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Mid-1800s – 1945: From botanicals to the first synthetic drugs===

The modern pharmaceutical industry traces its roots to two sources.  The first of these were local apothecaries that expanded from their traditional role distributing botanical drugs such as [[morphine]] and [[quinine]] to wholesale manufacture in the mid 1800s. Rational [[drug discovery]] from plants started particularly with the isolation of [[morphine]], analgesic and sleep-inducing agent from opium, by the German apothecary assistant Friedrich Sertürner who named the compound after the Greek god of dreams, [[Morpheus (mythology)|Morpheus]]. Multinational corporations including [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]], [[Hoffman-La Roche]], Burroughs-Wellcome (now part of [[Glaxo Smith Kline]]), [[Abbott Laboratories]], [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] and [[Upjohn]] (now part of [[Pfizer]]) began as local apothecary shops in the mid-1800s.  By the late 1880s, German dye manufacturers had perfected the purification of individual [[organic compounds]] from  tar and other mineral sources and had also established rudimentary methods in [[organic synthesis|organic chemical synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/83/8325/8325emergence.html |title=Top Pharmaceuticals: Introduction: EMERGENCE OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY: 1870-1930 |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of synthetic chemical methods allowed scientists to systematically vary the structure of chemical substances, and growth in the emerging science of [[pharmacology]] expanded their ability to evaluate the biological effects of these structural changes.

====Epinephrine, norepinephrine, and amphetamine====
By the 1890s, the profound effect of [[Adrenal gland|adrenal]] extracts on many different tissue types had been discovered, setting off a search both for the mechanism of chemical signalling and efforts to exploit these observations for the development of new drugs. The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as [[hemostatic]] agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897, [[John Jacob Abel|John Abel]] of [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins University]] identified the active principle as [[adrenaline|epinephrine]], which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist [[Jokichi Takamine]] later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to [[Parke-Davis]].  Parke-Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name [[Epinephrine (medication)|Adrenalin]]. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of [[asthma]] attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 ([[Primatene Mist]]).&lt;ref name="Sneader2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Sneader|title=Drug Discovery: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jglFsz5EJR8C|date=31 October 2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-01552-0|pages= 155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rasmussen 2006 288–323"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Making the First Anti-Depressant: Amphetamine in American Medicine, 1929-1950 |journal=J Hist Med Allied Sci |year=2006 |last=Rasmussen |first=Nicolas |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=288–323 |doi=10.1093/jhmas/jrj039 |pmid=16492800}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1929 epinephrine had been formulated into an inhaler for use in the treatment of nasal congestion.

While highly effective, the requirement for injection limited the use of epinephrine{{clarify|reason=Only epinephrine is mentioned until this point. What is norepinephrine? The context implies this should say 'epinephrine' instead.|date=June 2015}} and orally active derivatives were sought. A structurally similar compound, [[ephedrine]], (actually more similar to [[norepinephrine]],) was identified by Japanese chemists in the ''Ma Huang'' plant and marketed by Eli Lilly as an oral treatment for asthma.  Following the work of Henry Dale and George Barger at Burroughs-Wellcome, academic chemist Gordon Alles synthesized amphetamine and tested it in asthma patients in 1929. The drug proved to have only modest anti-asthma effects, but produced sensations of exhilaration and palpitations. Amphetamine was developed by [[Smith, Kline and French]] as a nasal decongestant under the trade name [[Benzedrine|Benzedrine Inhaler.]] Amphetamine was eventually developed for the treatment of [[narcolepsy]], [[post-encephalitic parkinsonism]], and mood elevation in depression and other psychiatric indications.  It received approval as a New and Nonofficial Remedy from the American Medical Association for these uses in 1937 and remained in common use for depression until the development of [[tricyclic antidepressants]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Rasmussen 2006 288–323"/&gt;

====Discovery and development of the barbiturates====
[[File:Veronal.jpg|thumb|upright|Diethylbarbituric acid was the first marketed barbiturate. It was sold by Bayer under the trade name Veronal]]
In 1903, [[Hermann Emil Fischer]] and [[Joseph von Mering]] disclosed their discovery that diethylbarbituric acid, formed from the reaction of diethylmalonic acid, phosphorus oxychloride and urea, induces sleep in dogs. The discovery was patented and licensed to [[Bayer pharmaceuticals]], which marketed the compound under the trade name [[Veronal]] as a sleep aid beginning in 1904. Systematic investigations of the effect of structural changes on potency and duration of action led to the discovery of [[phenobarbital]] at Bayer in 1911 and the discovery of its potent anti-epileptic activity in 1912.  Phenobarbital was among the most widely used drugs for the treatment of [[epilepsy]] through the 1970s, and as of 2014, remains on the World Health Organizations list of essential medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yasiry Z, Shorvon SD |title=How phenobarbital revolutionized epilepsy therapy: the story of phenobarbital therapy in epilepsy in the last 100 years |journal=Epilepsia |volume=53 Suppl 8 |issue= |pages=26–39 | date=December  2012 |pmid=23205960 |doi=10.1111/epi.12026 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=López-Muñoz F, Ucha-Udabe R, Alamo C |title=The history of barbiturates a century after their clinical introduction |journal=Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=329–43 | date=December  2005 |pmid=18568113 |pmc=2424120 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1950s and 1960s saw increased awareness of the addictive properties and abuse potential of barbiturates and amphetamines and led to increasing restrictions on their use and growing government oversight of prescribers.  Today, amphetamine is largely restricted to use in the treatment of [[attention deficit disorder]] and phenobarbital in the treatment of [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 |journal=NEJM |date=1965-11-25 |volume=273 |pages=1222–1223 |doi=10.1056/NEJM196511252732213 |quote="Officers of the Food and Drug Administration, aware of the seriousness of the problem, estimate that approximately half the 9,000,000,000 barbiturate and amphetamine capsules and tablets manufactured annually in this country are diverted to illegal use.

====Insulin====
A series of experiments performed from the late 1800s to the early 1900s revealed that [[diabetes]] is caused by the absence of a substance normally produced by the pancreas.  In 1869, [[Oskar Minkowski]] and [[Joseph von Mering]] found that diabetes could be induced in dogs by surgical removal of the pancreas.  In 1921, Canadian professor [[Frederick Banting]] and his student Charles Best repeated this study, and found that injections of pancreatic extract reversed the symptoms produced by pancreas removal.  Soon, the extract was demonstrated to work in people, but development of insulin therapy as a routine medical procedure was delayed by difficulties in producing the material in sufficient quantity and with reproducible purity.  The researchers sought assistance from industrial collaborators at Eli Lilly and Co. based on the company's experience with large scale purification of biological materials.  Chemist [[George B. Walden]] of Eli Lilly and Company found that careful adjustment of the pH of the extract allowed a relatively pure grade of insulin to be produced.  Under pressure from Toronto University and a potential patent challenge by academic scientists who had independently developed a similar purification method, an agreement was reached for non-exclusive production of insulin by multiple companies.  Prior to the discovery and widespread availability of insulin therapy the life expectancy of diabetics was only a few months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rosenfeld L |title=Insulin: discovery and controversy |journal=Clin. Chem. |volume=48 |issue=12 |pages=2270–88 | date=December  2002 |pmid=12446492 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early anti-infective research: Salvarsan, Prontosil, Penicillin and vaccines====
The development of drugs for the treatment of infectious diseases was a major focus of early research and development efforts; in 1900 pneumonia, tuberculosis, and diarrhea were the three leading causes of death in the United States and mortality in the first year of life exceeded 10%.&lt;ref name="www.cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr47/nvs47_28.pdf |title=www.cdc.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/lead1900_98.pdf |title=www.cdc.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911 [[arsphenamine]], the first synthetic anti-infective drug, was developed by [[Paul Ehrlich]] and chemist Alfred Bertheim of the Institute of Experimental Therapy in Berlin. The drug was given the commercial name Salvarsan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sepkowitz KA |title=One hundred years of Salvarsan |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=365 |issue=4 |pages=291–3 | date=July  2011 |pmid=21793743 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp1105345 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ehrlich, noting both the general toxicity of [[arsenic]] and the selective absorption of certain dyes by bacteria, hypothesized that an arsenic-containing dye with similar selective absorption properties could be used to treat bacterial infections.  Arsphenamine was prepared as part of a campaign to synthesize a series of such compounds, and found to exhibit partially selective toxicity.  Arsphenamine proved to be the first effective treatment for [[syphilis]], a disease which prior to that time was incurable and led inexorably to severe skin ulceration, neurological damage, and death.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Ehrlich's approach of systematically varying the chemical structure of synthetic compounds and measuring the effects of these changes on biological activity was pursued broadly by industrial scientists, including [[Bayer]] scientists Josef Klarer, Fritz Mietzsch, and [[Gerhard Domagk]].  This work, also based in the testing of compounds available from the German dye industry, led to the development of [[Prontosil]], the first representative of the [[sulfonamide]] class of [[antibiotics]].  Compared to arsphenamine, the sulfonamides had a broader spectrum of activity and were far less toxic, rendering them useful for infections caused by pathogens such as [[streptococci]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aminov RI |title=A brief history of the antibiotic era: lessons learned and challenges for the future |journal=Front Microbiol |volume=1 |issue= |pages=134 |year=2010 |pmid=21687759 |pmc=3109405 |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2010.00134 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Domagk received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]] for this discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hager|first1=Thomas|title=The demon under the microscope : from battlefield hospitals to Nazi labs, one doctor's heroic search for the world's first miracle drug|date=2006|publisher=Harmony Books|location=New York|isbn=1-4000-8213-7|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nobel Prize Facts|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/facts/|website=www.nobelprize.org|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the dramatic decrease in deaths from infectious diseases that occurred prior to [[World War II]] was primarily the result of improved public health measures such as clean water and less crowded housing, and the impact of anti-infective drugs and vaccines was significant mainly after World War II.&lt;ref name="www.nber.org"&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Cutler |first2=Ellen |last2=Meara |title=Changes in the Age Distribution of Mortality Over the 20th Century |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 8556 |date=October 2001 |doi=10.3386/w8556 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein 2012 167"&gt;{{cite book |last=Klein |first1=Herbert |title=A Population History of the United States |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2012 |page=167 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, [[Alexander Fleming]] discovered the antibacterial effects of [[penicillin]], but its exploitation for the treatment of human disease awaited the development of methods for its large scale production and purification.  These were developed by a U.S. and British government-led consortium of pharmaceutical companies during the Second World War.&lt;ref name=JParas&gt;{{cite book

Early progress toward the development of vaccines occurred throughout this period, primarily in the form of academic and government-funded basic research directed toward the identification of the pathogens responsible for common communicable diseases. In 1885 [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Pierre Paul Émile Roux]] created the first [[rabies vaccine]]. The first [[diphtheria vaccine]]s were produced in 1914 from a mixture of [[diphtheria toxin]] and [[Diphtheria antitoxin|antitoxin]] (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths.  In 1923 parallel efforts by [[Gaston Ramon]] at the Pasteur Institute and [[Alexander Glenny]] at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of [[GlaxoSmithKline]]) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with [[formaldehyde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/timelines/diphtheria |title=Diphtheria — Timelines — History of Vaccines |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, [[Maurice Hilleman]] of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first [[Japanese encephalitis vaccine|vaccine against Japanese encephelitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/13/local/me-hilleman13++ |title=Maurice R.

====Unsafe drugs and early industry regulation====
[[File:Elixir Sulfanilamide.jpg|thumb|upright|In 1937 over 100 people died after ingesting a solution of the antibacterial [[sulfanilamide]] formulated in the toxic solvent diethylene glycol]]
Prior to the 20th century drugs were generally produced by small scale manufacturers with little regulatory control over manufacturing or claims of safety and efficacy. To the extent that such laws did exist, enforcement was lax. In the United States, increased regulation of vaccines and other biological drugs was spurred by tetanus outbreaks and deaths caused by the distribution of contaminated smallpox vaccine and diphtheria antitoxin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/Milestones/ucm128305.htm |title=Significant Dates in U.S. Food and Drug Law History |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Biologics Control Act of 1902 required that federal government grant premarket approval for every biological drug and for the process and facility producing such drugs.  This was followed in 1906 by the [[Pure Food and Drugs Act]], which forbade the interstate distribution of adulterated or misbranded foods and drugs. A drug was considered misbranded if it contained alcohol, morphine, opium, cocaine, or any of several other potentially dangerous or addictive drugs, and if its label failed to indicate the quantity or proportion of such drugs.  The government's attempts to use the law to prosecute manufacturers for making unsupported claims of efficacy were undercut by a Supreme Court ruling restricting the federal government's enforcement powers to cases of incorrect specification of the drug's ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fdareview.org/history.shtml#first |title=FDAReview.org, a project of The Independent Institute |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 over 100 people died after ingesting "[[Elixir Sulfanilamide]]" manufactured by S.E. Massengill Company of Tennessee.  The product was formulated in [[diethylene glycol]], a highly toxic solvent that is now widely used as antifreeze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/aboutfda/whatwedo/history/productregulation/sulfanilamidedisaster/default.htm |title=Sulfanilamide Disaster |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the laws extant at that time, prosecution of the manufacturer was possible only under the technicality that the product had been called an "elixir", which literally implied a solution in ethanol.  In response to this episode, the U.S. Congress passed [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938]], which for the first time required pre-market demonstration of safety before a drug could be sold, and explicitly prohibited false therapeutic claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/aboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/origin/ucm054826.htm |title=FDA History - Part II |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Streptomycin, discovered during a Merck-funded research program in Selman Waksman's laboratory at Rutgers in 1943, became the first effective treatment for tuberculosis.  At the time of its discovery, sanitoriums for the isolation of tuberculosis-infected people were an ubiquitous feature of cities in developed countries, with 50% dying within 5 years of admission.&lt;ref name="Kingston W 441–62"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Rosaleen|title=Antibacterial agents chemistry, mode of action, mechanisms of resistance, and clinical applications|date=2012|publisher=WiBlackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=9780470972458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Federal Trade Commission report issued in 1958 attempted to quantify the effect of antibiotic development on American public health. The report found that over the period 1946-1955, there was a 42% drop in the incidence of diseases for which antibiotics were effective and only a 20% drop in those for which antibiotics were not effective. The report concluded that "it appears that the use of antibiotics, early diagnosis, and other factors have limited the epidemic spread and thus the number of these diseases which have occurred". The study further examined mortality rates for eight common diseases for which antibiotics offered effective therapy (syphilis, tuberculosis, dysentery, scarlet fever, whooping cough, meningococcal infections, and pneumonia), and found a 56% decline over the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Trade Commission Report of Antibiotics Manufacture, June 1958 (Washington D.C., Government Printing Office, 1958) pages 98-120&lt;/ref&gt; Notable among these was a 75% decline in deaths due to tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Trade Commission Report of Antibiotics Manufacture, June 1958 (Washington D.C., Government Printing Office, 1958) page 277&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Measles US 1944-2007 inset.png| alt=Measles cases 1944-1964 follow a highly variable epidemic pattern, with 150,000-850,000 cases per year. A sharp decline followed introduction of the vaccine in 1963, with fewer than 25,000 cases reported in 1968. Outbreaks around 1971 and 1977 gave 75,000 and 57,000 cases, respectively. Cases were stable at a few thousand per year until an outbreak of 28,000 in 1990. Cases declined from a few hundred per year in the early 1990s to a few dozen in the 2000s. | thumb | Measles cases reported in the [[United States]] before and after introduction of the vaccine.]]

During the years 1940-1955, the rate of decline in the U.S. death rate accelerated from 2% per year to 8% per year, then returned to the historical rate of 2% per year. The dramatic decline in the immediate post-war years has been attributed to the rapid development of new treatments and vaccines for infectious disease that occurred during these years.&lt;ref name="www.nber.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein 2012 167"/&gt;
Vaccine development continued to accelerate, with the most notable achievement of the period being [[Jonas Salk]]'s 1954 development of the polio vaccine under the funding of the non-profit National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. The vaccine process was never patented, but was instead given to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture as a low-cost [[generic drug|generic]].  In 1960 Maurice Hilleman of [[Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme]] identified the [[SV40]] virus, which was later shown to cause tumors in many mammalian species.  It was later determined that SV40 was present as a contaminant in polio vaccine lots that had been administered to 90% of the children in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=SWEET BH, HILLEMAN MR |title=The vacuolating virus, S.V. 40 |journal=Proc.

Other notable new vaccines of the period include those for measles (1962, John Franklin Enders of Children's Medical Center Boston, later refined by Maurice Hilleman at Merck), Rubella (1969, Hilleman, Merck) and mumps (1967, Hilleman, Merck)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofvaccines.org/ |title=History of Vaccines — A Vaccine History Project of The College of Physicians of Philadelphia |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States incidences of rubella, congenital rubella syndrome, measles, and mumps all fell by &gt;95% in the immediate aftermath of widespread vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6204a1.htm |title=Prevention of Measles, Rubella, Congenital Rubella Syndrome, and Mumps, 2013 |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first 20 years of licensed measles vaccination in the U.S. prevented an estimated 52 million cases of the disease, 17,400 cases of [[mental retardation]], and 5,200 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bloch AB, Orenstein WA, Stetler HC, etal |title=Health impact of measles vaccination in the United States |journal=Pediatrics |volume=76 |issue=4 |pages=524–32 |year=1985 |pmid=3931045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early developments in the field of treating hypertension included quaternary ammonium ion sympathetic nervous system blocking agents, but these compounds were never widely used due to their severe side effects, because the long term health consequences of high blood pressure had not yet been established, and because they had to be administered by injection.

In 1952 researchers at Ciba discovered the first orally available vasodilator, hydralazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sneader |first1=Walter |title=Drug Discovery.

====Oral Contraceptives====
Prior to the second world war, birth control was prohibited in many countries, and in the United States even the discussion of contraceptive methods sometimes led to prosecution under [[Comstock laws]].  The history of the development of oral contraceptives is thus closely tied to the [[Birth control movement in the United States|birth control movement]] and the efforts of activists [[Margaret Sanger]], [[Mary Dennett]], and [[Emma Goldman]]. Based on fundamental research performed by [[Gregory Pincus]] and synthetic methods for progesterone developed by [[Carl Djerassi]] at [[Syntex]] and by [[Frank Colton]] at [[G.D. Searle &amp; Co.]], the first oral contraceptive, [[Enovid]], was developed by E.D. Searle and Co. and approved by the FDA in 1960.  The original formulation incorporated vastly excessive doses of hormones, and caused severe side effects.  Nonetheless, by 1962, 1.2 million American women were on the pill, and by 1965 the number had increased to 6.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/health/a-brief-history-of-the-birth-control-pill/480/ |title=A brief history of the birth control pill - The pill timeline &amp;#124; Need to Know &amp;#124; PBS |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/why-the-oral-contraceptive-is-just-known-as-the-pill-4337831/?no-ist |title=Why the Oral Contraceptive Is Just Known as "The Pill" |format= |publisher=www.smithsonianmag.com |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/250337.stm |title=BBC News &amp;#124; HEALTH &amp;#124; A short history of the pill |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegulation/SelectionsFromFDLIUpdateSeriesonFDAHistory/ucm092009.htm |title=FDA's Approval of the First Oral Contraceptive, Enovid |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of a convenient form of temporary contraceptive led to dramatic changes in social mores including expanding the range of lifestyle options available to women, reducing the reliance of women on men for contraceptive practice, encouraging the delay of marriage, and increasing pre-marital co-habitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15984258 |title=BBC News - How the contraceptive pill changed Britain |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thalidomide and the Kefauver-Harris Amendments====
[[File:NCP14053.jpg|thumb|Malformation of a baby born to a mother who had taken thalidomide while pregnant.]]
In the U.S., a push for revisions of the FD&amp;C Act emerged from Congressional hearings led by Senator [[Estes Kefauver]] of Tennessee in 1959. The hearings covered a wide range of policy issues, including advertising abuses, questionable efficacy of drugs, and the need for greater regulation of the industry. While momentum for new legislation temporarily flagged under extended debate, a new tragedy emerged that underscored the need for more comprehensive regulation and provided the driving force for the passage of new laws.

On 12 September 1960, an American licensee, the William S. Merrell Company of Cincinnati, submitted a new drug application for Kevadon ([[thalidomide]]), a sedative that had been marketed in Europe since 1956. The FDA medical officer in charge of reviewing the compound, [[Frances Oldham Kelsey|Frances Kelsey]], believed that the data supporting the safety of thalidomide was incomplete. The firm continued to pressure Kelsey and the FDA to approve the application until November 1961, when the drug was pulled off the German market because of its association with grave congenital abnormalities. Several thousand newborns in Europe and elsewhere suffered the [[teratogenic]] effects of thalidomide. Without approval from the FDA, the firm distributed Kevadon to over 1,000 physicians there under the guise of investigational use. Over 20,000 Americans received thalidomide in this "study," including 624 pregnant patients, and about 17 known newborns suffered the effects of the drug.{{citation needed|reason=Where does "17" come from?|date=June 2015}}

The thalidomide tragedy resurrected Kefauver's bill to enhance drug regulation that had stalled in Congress, and the [[Kefauver-Harris Amendment]] became law on 10 October 1962. Manufacturers henceforth had to prove to FDA that their drugs were effective as well as safe before they could go on the US market. The FDA received authority to regulate advertising of prescription drugs and to establish [[good manufacturing practices]]. The law required that all drugs introduced between 1938 and 1962 had to be effective. An FDA - National Academy of Sciences collaborative study showed that nearly 40 percent of these products were not effective. A similarly comprehensive study of over-the-counter products began ten years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/FOrgsHistory/CDER/CenterforDrugEvaluationandResearchBrochureandChronology/ucm114470.htm#1951 |title=Brochure: The History of Drug Regulation in the United States |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970–1980s===

====Statins====
In 1971, Akira Endo, a Japanese biochemist working for the pharmaceutical company Sankyo, identified mevastatin (ML-236B), a molecule produced by the fungus Penicillium citrinum, as an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, a critical enzyme used by the body to produce cholesterol.  [[Animal testing|Animal trials]] showed very good inhibitory effect as in [[clinical trial]]s, however a long term study in dogs found toxic effects at higher doses and as a result mevastatin was believed to be too toxic for human use.  Mevastatin was never marketed, because of its adverse effects of tumors, muscle deterioration, and sometimes death in laboratory dogs.

[[P. Roy Vagelos]], chief scientist and later CEO of [[Merck &amp; Co]], was interested, and made several trips to Japan starting in 1975. By 1978, Merck had isolated [[lovastatin]] (mevinolin, MK803) from the fungus ''[[Aspergillus terreus]]'', first marketed in 1987 as Mevacor.&lt;ref name=Tobert_2003&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tobert |first=Jonathan A. |date=July 2003 |title=Lovastatin and beyond: the history of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors |journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery |volume=2 |issue=7 |pages=517–526 |doi=10.1038/nrd1112 |issn=1474-1776 |pmid=12815379}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Endo_1992&gt;{{cite journal | author = Endo A | title = The discovery and development of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors | journal = Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 33 | issue = 11 | pages = 1569–82 | date = 1 November 1992 | pmid = 1464741 | url = http://www.jlr.org/cgi/reprint/33/11/1569 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Endo_2004&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Endo   | first = Akira  | title = The origin of the statins  | journal = International Congress Series   | volume = 1262  | pages = 3–8  |  year = 2004 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B7581-4C9R7K1-2&amp;_user=5915660&amp;_origUdi=B6X14-4DPSB32-P&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_coverDate=05%2F31%2F2004&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_orig=article&amp;_acct=C000068853&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=5915660&amp;md5=b7da267cdd480f83626db6ca9959aed4  | doi = 10.1016/j.ics.2003.12.099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1994, the results of a Merck-sponsored study, the [[Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study]], were announced. Researchers tested [[simvastatin]], later sold by Merck as Zocor, on 4,444 patients with high cholesterol and heart disease. After five years, the study concluded the patients saw a 35% reduction in their cholesterol, and their chances of dying of a heart attack were reduced by 42%.&lt;ref name="4S"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Randomised trial of cholesterol lowering in 4444 patients with coronary heart disease: the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) | journal = Lancet | volume = 344 | issue = 8934 | pages = 1383–9 | date = November 1994 | pmid = 7968073 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(94)90566-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Zocor and Mevacor both made Merck over US$1 billion.

==Research and development==
{{Main|Drug discovery|Drug development}}
'''Drug discovery''' is the process by which potential [[medications|drugs]] are discovered or designed. In the past most drugs have been discovered either by isolating the active ingredient from traditional remedies or by [[serendipity|serendipitous]] discovery. Modern [[biotechnology]] often focuses on understanding the [[metabolic pathway]]s related to a [[disease]] state or [[pathogen]], and manipulating these pathways using [[molecular biology]] or [[biochemistry]]. A great deal of early-stage drug discovery has traditionally been carried out by universities and research institutions.

'''Drug development''' refers to activities undertaken after a compound is identified as a potential drug in order to establish its suitability as a medication. Objectives of drug development are to determine appropriate [[Pharmaceutical formulation|formulation]] and [[dosing]], as well as to establish [[drug safety|safety]]. Research in these areas generally includes a combination of ''[[in vitro]]'' studies, ''[[in vivo]]'' studies, and [[clinical trials]]. The cost of late stage development has meant it is usually done by the larger pharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | publisher = Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development | title = Annual Impact Report | url = http://csdd.tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, large multinational corporations exhibit [[vertical integration]], participating in a broad range of drug discovery and development, manufacturing and quality control, marketing, sales, and distribution. Smaller organizations, on the other hand, often focus on a specific aspect such as discovering drug candidates or developing formulations. Often, collaborative agreements between research organizations and large pharmaceutical companies are formed to explore the potential of new drug substances. More recently, multi-nationals are increasingly relying on [[contract research organization]]s to manage drug development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Clinical-Development/Pfizer-teams-with-Parexel-and-Icon-in-CRO-sector-s-latest-strategic-deals|title=Pfizer teams with Parexel and Icon in CRO sector's latest strategic deals|author=Outsourcing-Pharma.com|work=Outsourcing-Pharma.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The cost of innovation===

[[medication|Drug]] discovery and development is very expensive; of all compounds investigated for use in humans only a small fraction are eventually [[Approved drugs|approved]] in most nations by government appointed medical institutions or boards, who have to approve new [[medication|drugs]] before they can be marketed in those countries. In 2010 18 NMEs (New Molecular Entities) were approved and three [[biologics]] by the FDA, or 21 in total, which is down from 26 in 2009 and 24 in 2008. On the other hand, there were only 18 approvals in total in 2007 and 22 back in 2006. Since 2001, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has averaged 22.9 approvals a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmalot.com/2011/02/how-many-new-drugs-did-fda-approve-last-year/ |title=How Many New Drugs Did FDA Approve Last Year?|publisher=pharmalot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This approval comes only after heavy investment in [[pre-clinical development]] and [[clinical trial]]s, as well as a commitment to ongoing [[safety monitoring]]. Drugs which fail part-way through this process often incur large costs, while generating no revenue in return. If the cost of these failed drugs is taken into account, the cost of developing a successful new drug ([[new chemical entity]], or NCE), has been estimated at about 1.3 billion USD&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csdd.tufts.edu/Research/Milestones.asp|title=Research|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;(not including [[Pharmaceutical marketing|marketing expenses]]). Professors Light and Lexchin reported in 2012, however, that the rate of approval for new drugs has been a relatively stable average rate of 15 to 25 for decades.&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;{{cite news|author=Perry, Susan|title=Donald Light and Joel Lexchin in BMJ 2012;345:e4348, quoted in: Big Pharma's claim of an 'innovation crisis' is a myth, BMJ authors say|url=http://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2012/08/big-pharmas-claim-innovation-crisis-myth-bmj-authors-say|date=8 August 2012|publisher=MinnPost|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry-wide research and investment reached a record $65.3 billion in 2009.&lt;ref name="Press release"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrma.org/about/about-phrma|title=About PhRMA - PhRMA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the cost of research in the U.S. was about {{dollarsign|$}}34.2 billion between 1995 and 2010, revenues rose faster (revenues rose by {{dollarsign|$}}200.4 billion in that time).&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt;

A study by the consulting firm [[Bain &amp; Company]] reported that the cost for discovering, developing and launching (which factored in marketing and other business expenses) a new drug (along with the prospective drugs that fail) rose over a five-year period to nearly $1.7 billion in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Has the Pharmaceutical Blockbuster Model Gone Bust?|url=http://www.bain.com/about/press/press-releases/has-the-pharmaceutical-blockbuster-model-gone-bust.aspx|website=www.bain.com|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Forbes, by 2010 development costs were between $4 billion to $11 billion per drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2012/02/10/the-truly-staggering-cost-of-inventing-new-drugs/ | title = The Truly Staggering Cost Of Inventing New Drugs | date = 2012-02-10 | author = Matthew Harper | work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these estimates also take into account the [[opportunity cost]] of investing capital many years before revenues are realized (see [[Time-value of money]]). Because of the very long time needed for discovery, development, and approval of pharmaceuticals, these costs can accumulate to nearly half the total expense. A direct consequence within the pharmaceutical industry value chain is that major pharmaceutical multinationals tend to increasingly outsource risks related to fundamental research, which somewhat reshapes the industry ecosystem with biotechnology companies playing an increasingly important role, and overall strategies being redefined accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.portail-ie.fr/article/1256/Are-European-biotechnology-companies-sufficiently-protected/ | title = Are European biotechnology companies sufficiently protected? | date = 2015-06-18 | author = IMS Health | work=Portal of Competitive Intelligence}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some approved drugs, such as those based on re-formulation of an existing [[active ingredient]] (also referred to as Line-extensions) are much less expensive to develop.

===Controversies===
Due to repeated accusations and findings that some clinical trials conducted or funded by pharmaceutical companies may report only positive results for the preferred medication, the industry has been looked at much more closely by independent groups and government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;list_uids=14970094&amp;dopt=Abstract|title=Association between industry funding and statistically significant pro-industry findings in medical and surgical randomized trials|publisher=|vauthors=Bhandari M, Busse JW, Jackowski D, Montori VM, Schunemann H, Sprague S, Mears D, Schemitsch EH, Heels-Ansdell D, Devereaux PJ |date=2004-02-17|accessdate=2007-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to specific cases in which unfavorable data from pharmaceutical company-sponsored research was not published, the [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] have published new guidelines urging companies to report all findings and limit the financial involvement in drug companies of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moynihan|first1=R.|title=Who pays for the pizza?

Drug researchers not directly employed by pharmaceutical companies often look to companies for grants, and companies often look to researchers for studies that will make their products look favorable. Sponsored researchers are rewarded by drug companies, for example with support for their conference/symposium costs. Lecture scripts and even journal articles presented by academic researchers may actually be "ghost-written" by pharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barnett|first1=Antony|title=Revealed: how drug firms 'hoodwink' medical journals|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/dec/07/health.businessofresearch|accessdate=19 May 2016|work=the Guardian|date=7 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation by [[ProPublica]] found that at least 21 doctors have been paid more than $500,000 for speeches and consulting by drugs manufacturers since 2009, with half of the top earners working in [[psychiatry]], and about $2 billion in total paid to doctors for such services. [[AstraZeneca]], [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] and [[Eli Lilly]] have paid billions of dollars in federal settlements over allegations that they paid doctors to promote drugs for unapproved uses. Some prominent medical schools have since tightened rules on faculty acceptance of such payments by drug companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ornstein|first1=Tracy Weber, Charles|title=Dollars for Docs Mints a Millionaire|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/dollars-for-docs-mints-a-millionaire|accessdate=19 May 2016|work=ProPublica|date=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this viewpoint, an article and associated editorial in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] in May 2015 emphasized the importance of pharmaceutical industry-physician interactions for the development of novel treatments, and argued that moral outrage over industry malfeasance had unjustifiably led many to overemphasize the problems created by financial conflicts of interest.  The article noted that major healthcare organizations such as National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health, the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, the World Economic Forum, the Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, and the Food and Drug Administration had encouraged greater interactions between physicians and industry in order to bring greater benefits to patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1503623 |title=Revisiting the Commercial–Academic Interface — NEJM |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMms1502493#t=article |title=Reconnecting the Dots — Reinterpreting Industry–Physician Relations — NEJM |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product approval==
In the United States, new pharmaceutical products must be approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) as being both safe and effective. This process generally involves submission of an [[Investigational New Drug]] filing with sufficient pre-clinical data to support proceeding with human trials. Following IND approval, three phases of progressively larger human clinical trials may be conducted. Phase I generally studies [[toxicity]] using healthy volunteers. Phase II can include [[pharmacokinetics]] and [[dosing]] in patients, and Phase III is a very large study of efficacy in the intended patient population. Following the successful completion of phase III testing, a [[New Drug Application]] is submitted to the FDA. The FDA review the data and if the product is seen as having a positive benefit-risk assessment, approval to market the product in the US is granted.&lt;ref name="standard2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liberti L, McAuslane JN, Walker S |title=Standardizing the Benefit-Risk Assessment of New Medicines: Practical Applications of Frameworks for the Pharmaceutical Healthcare Professional
|url=http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Abstract/2011/25030/Standardizing_the_Benefit_Risk_Assessment_of_New.1.aspx |journal=Pharm Med |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=139–46 |year=2011 |doi=10.1007/BF03256855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourth phase of post-approval surveillance is also often required due to the fact that even the largest clinical trials cannot effectively predict the prevalence of rare side-effects. [[Postmarketing surveillance]] ensures that after marketing the safety of a drug is monitored closely. In certain instances, its indication may need to be limited to particular patient groups, and in others the substance is withdrawn from the market completely.

The FDA provides information about approved drugs at the Orange Book site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cder/ob/default.htm|title=Electronic Orange Book|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=2007-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, the [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] approves drugs for use, though the evaluation is done by the [[European Medicines Agency]], an agency of the [[European Union]] based in London. Normally an approval in the UK and other European countries comes later than one in the USA.  Then it is the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE), for England and Wales, who decides if and how the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) will allow (in the sense of paying for) their use.  The [[British National Formulary]] is the core guide for pharmacists and clinicians.

In many non-US western countries a 'fourth hurdle' of [[cost effectiveness|cost effectiveness analysis]] has developed before new technologies can be provided. This focuses on the efficiency (in terms of the cost per [[QALY]]) of the technologies in question rather than their efficacy. In England and Wales NICE decides whether and in what circumstances drugs and technologies will be made available by the NHS, whilst similar arrangements exist with the [[Scottish Medicines Consortium]] in Scotland, and the [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee]] in Australia. A product must pass the threshold for cost-effectiveness if it is to be approved. Treatments must represent 'value for money' and a net benefit to society.

===Orphan drugs===
{{Main|Orphan drug}}
There are [[Orphan Drug Act|special rules]] for certain rare diseases ("orphan diseases") in several major drug regulatory territories. For example, diseases involving fewer than 200,000 patients in the United States, or larger populations in certain circumstances are subject to the Orphan Drug Act.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/orphan/oda.htm|title=The Orphan Drug Act (as amended)|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=2007-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because medical research and development of drugs to treat such diseases is financially disadvantageous, companies that do so are rewarded with tax reductions, fee waivers, and market exclusivity on that drug for a limited time (seven years), regardless of whether the drug is protected by patents.

In 2011, global spending on prescription drugs topped $954 billion, even as growth slowed somewhat in Europe and North America. The United States accounts for more than a third of the global pharmaceutical market, with $340 billion in annual sales followed by the EU and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vfa.de/download/SHOW/en/statistics/pharmaceuticalmarket/vfastat_30_en_fa_mt.pdf/vfastat_30_en_sw_mt.pdf (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging markets such as China, Russia, South Korea and Mexico outpaced that market, growing a huge 81 percent.&lt;ref name='forbes-10'&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/home/sciencesandmedicine/2006/03/21/pfizer-merck-amgen-cx_mh_pk_0321topdrugs.html|title=The World's Ten Best-Selling Drugs|author1=Herper, Matthew  |author2=Kang, Peter |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=[[Forbes]]|date=2006-03-22|accessdate=2007-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imshealth.com/deployedfiles/ims/Global/Content/Corporate/Press%20Room/Top-Line%20Market%20Data%20&amp;%20Trends/2011%20Top-line%20Market%20Data/Regional_Pharma_Market_by_Spending_2011-2016.pdf|title=Creating Connected Solutions for Better Healthcare Performance|work=IMS Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top ten best-selling drugs of 2013 totaled $75.6 billion in sales, with the anti-inflammatory drug [[Humira]] being the best-selling drug worldwide at $10.7 billion in sales. The second and third best selling were Enbrel and Remicade, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/27/bestselling-prescription-drugs|title=World's 10 bestselling prescription drugs made $75bn last year|author=Julia Kollewe|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top three best-selling drugs in the United States in 2013 were Abilify ($6.3 billion,) Nexium ($6 billion) and Humira ($5.4 billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/stats/top100/2013/sales|title=Top 100 Drugs for 2013 by Sales - U.S. Pharmaceutical Statistics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-selling drug ever, [[Atorvastatin|Lipitor]], averaged $13 billion annually and netted $141 billion total over its lifetime before Pfizer's patent expired in November 2011.

[[IMS Health]] publishes an analysis of trends expected in the pharmaceutical industry in 2007, including increasing profits in most sectors despite loss of some patents, and new 'blockbuster' drugs on the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imshealth.com/ims/portal/front/articleC/0,2777,6025_3665_79210022,00.html|title=IMS Health Forecasts 5 to 6 Percent Growth for Global Pharmaceutical Market in 2007|publisher=IMS Health|date=2006-10-24|accessdate=2007-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patents and generics ===
Depending on a number of considerations, a company may apply for and be granted a [[chemical patent|patent]] for the drug, or the process of producing the drug, granting exclusivity rights typically for about 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/patents_faq.html#patent_role Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225083135/http://www.wipo.int/patentscope/en/patents_faq.html |date=25 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only after rigorous study and testing, which takes 10 to 15 years on average, will governmental authorities grant permission for the company to market and sell the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phrma.org/files/NDA2006.pdf|format=PDF|title=New Drug Approvals in 2006|date=March 2007|accessdate=2008-02-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080228023631/http://www.phrma.org/files/NDA2006.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patent protection enables the owner of the patent to recover the costs of research and development through high profit margins for the [[brand]]ed drug. When the patent protection for the drug expires, a [[generic drug]] is usually developed and sold by a competing company.  The development and approval of generics is less expensive, allowing them to be sold at a lower price. Often the owner of the branded drug will introduce a generic version before the patent expires in order to get a head start in the generic market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phrma.org/files/IMS%20Authorized%20Generics%20Report_6-22-06.pdf|format=PDF|title=Assessment of Authorized Generics in the U.S|publisher=IMS Consulting|date=June 2006|accessdate=2008-02-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080228023633/http://www.phrma.org/files/IMS+Authorized+Generics+Report_6-22-06.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restructuring has therefore become routine, driven by the patent expiration of products launched during the industry's "golden era" in the 1990s and companies' failure to develop sufficient new blockbuster products to replace lost revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dddmag.com/news-Sanofi-Laying-Off-1700-in-US-101110.aspx|title=Sanofi Laying Off 1,700 in US|work=Drug Discovery &amp; Development}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prescriptions ===
In the U.S., the value of prescriptions increased over the period of 1995 to 2005 by 3.4 billion annually, a 61 percent increase. [[Annual pharmaceutical drug sales|Retail sales of prescription drugs]] jumped 250 percent from $72 billion to $250 billion, while the average price of prescriptions more than doubled from $30 to $68.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2007 Health and Nutrition - Census|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2007pubs/08abstract/health.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==

Advertising is common in healthcare journals as well as through more mainstream media routes. In some countries, notably the US, they are allowed to advertise directly to the general public. Pharmaceutical companies generally employ sales people (often called 'drug reps' or, an older term, 'detail men') to market directly and personally to physicians and other healthcare providers. In some countries, notably the US, [[pharmaceutical lobby|pharmaceutical companies also employ lobbyists]] to influence politicians. Marketing of prescription drugs in the US is regulated by the federal [[Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA)|Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987]].

===To healthcare professionals===
The book ''[[Bad Pharma]]'' also discusses the influence of drug representatives, how ghostwriters are employed by the drug companies to write papers for academics to publish, how independent the academic journals really are, how the drug companies finance doctors' continuing education, and how patients' groups are often funded by industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldacre|first1=Ben|title=Bad pharma : how drug companies mislead doctors and harm patients|date=2014|isbn=9780865478060|edition=First American Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct to consumer advertising===
{{Main|Direct-to-consumer advertising}}

Since the 1980s new methods of marketing for prescription drugs to consumers have become important. Direct-to-consumer media advertising was legalised in the FDA Guidance for Industry on Consumer-Directed Broadcast Advertisements.

==Controversy about drug marketing and lobbying==
There has been increasing controversy surrounding pharmaceutical marketing and influence. There have been accusations and findings of influence on doctors and other health professionals through drug reps including the constant provision of marketing 'gifts' and biased information to health professionals;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/05/AR2005050501115_pf.html|title= Merck CEO Resigns as Drug Probe Continues|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|date=2005-05-06|accessdate=2007-05-23 | first=Marc | last=Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt; highly prevalent advertising in journals and conferences; funding independent healthcare organizations and health promotion campaigns; lobbying physicians and politicians (more than any other industry in the US&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicintegrity.org/rx/report.aspx?aid=723|title=Drug Lobby Second to None: How the pharmaceutical industry gets its way in Washington|publisher=publicintegrity.org|date=2005-07-07|accessdate=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;); sponsorship of [[medical school]]s or nurse training; sponsorship of continuing educational events, with influence on the curriculum;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moynihan|first1=R.|title=Drug company sponsorship of education could be replaced at a fraction of its cost|journal=BMJ|date=29 May 2003|volume=326|issue=7400|pages=1163–1163|doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7400.1163|pmid=12775595|pmc=1126044}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hiring physicians as paid consultants on medical advisory boards.

Some advocacy groups, such as [[No Free Lunch (organization)|No Free Lunch]] and [[AllTrials]], have criticized the effect of drug marketing to physicians because they say it biases physicians to prescribe the marketed drugs even when others might be cheaper or better for the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. No Free Lunch|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2003/03/dr-no-free-lunch|website=Mother Jones|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been related accusations of [[disease mongering]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moynihan|first1=Ray|last2=Cassels|first2=Alan|title=Selling sickness : how the drug companies are turning us all into patients|date=2005|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|location=Crows Nest, N.S.W.|isbn=1-74114-579-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;(over-medicalising) to expand the market for medications. An inaugural conference on that subject took place in Australia in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collections.plos.org/plosmedicine/diseasemongering-2006.php|title=A Collection of Articles on Disease Mongering|publisher=Public Library of Science|accessdate=2007-05-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607212643/http://collections.plos.org/plosmedicine/diseasemongering-2006.php|archivedate=7 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the Government-funded [[National Prescribing Service]] launched the [http://www.nps.org.au/health_professionals/ferh "Finding Evidence – Recognising Hype"] program, aimed at educating GPs on methods for independent drug analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pharmaceutical Market Research, Trends And Analysis Reports|url=https://literated.com/industry/Pharmaceutical-Industry|publisher=www.literated.com|accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 review by a special committee of the [[UK]] government came to all the above conclusions in a European Union context&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epha.org/a/1773|title=UK parliamentarians put the pharma industry under the spotlight|publisher=European Public Health Alliance|accessdate=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst also highlighting the contributions and needs of the industry.

Meta-analyses have shown that psychiatric studies sponsored by pharmaceutical companies are several times more likely to report positive results, and if a drug company employee is involved the effect is even larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buchkowsky | first1 = SS | last2 = Jewesson | first2 = PJ | date = Apr 2004 | title = Industry sponsorship and authorship of clinical trials over 20 years | url = | journal = Ann Pharmacother | volume = 38 | issue = 4| pages = 579–85 | pmid = 14982982 | doi=10.1345/aph.1D267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Perlis RH, Perlis CS, Wu Y, Hwang C, Joseph M, Nierenberg AA |title=Industry sponsorship and financial conflict of interest in the reporting of clinical trials in psychiatry |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=162 |issue=10 |pages=1957–60 |date=October 2005  |pmid=16199844 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.162.10.1957 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tungaraza | first1 = T | last2 = Poole | first2 = R | date = Jul 2007 | title = Influence of drug company authorship and sponsorship on drug trial outcomes | url = | journal = Br J Psychiatry | volume = 191 | issue = 1| pages = 82–3 | pmid = 17602130 | doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.106.024547}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influence has also extended to the training of doctors and nurses in medical schools, which is being fought.

It has been argued that the design of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] and the expansion of the criteria represents an increasing medicalization of human nature, or "[[disease mongering]]", driven by drug company influence on psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Healy | first1 = D | year = 2006 | title = The Latest Mania: Selling Bipolar Disorder | url = http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030185&amp;ct=1 | journal = PLoS Med | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | page = e185 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030185 | pmid = 16597178 | pmc = 1434505 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090212110644/http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0030185&amp;ct=1 | archivedate = 12 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The potential for direct [[conflict of interest]] has been raised, partly because roughly half the authors who selected and defined the DSM-IV psychiatric disorders had or previously had financial relationships with the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cosgrove|first1=Lisa|last2=Krimsky|first2=Sheldon|last3=Vijayaraghavan|first3=Manisha|last4=Schneider|first4=Lisa|title=Financial Ties between DSM-IV Panel Members and the Pharmaceutical Industry|journal=Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics|date=2006|volume=75|issue=3|pages=154–160|doi=10.1159/000091772|pmid=16636630}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, starting in 2013, under the Physician Financial Transparency Reports (part of the Sunshine Act), the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services has to collect information from applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations in order to report information about their financial relationships with physicians and hospitals. Data are made public in the  Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services website. The expectation is that relationship between doctors and Pharmaceutical industry will become fully transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.gov/openpayments/|title=Open Payments|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report conducted by the [[Center for Responsive Politics]], there were more than 1,100 lobbyists working in some capacity for the pharmaceutical business in 2017. In the first quarter of 2017, the health products and pharmaceutical industry spent $78 million on lobbying member of the United States Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lipton |first=Eric |last2=Thomas |first2=Katie |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/29/health/drug-lobbyists-battle-cry-over-prices-blame-the-others.html |title=Drug Lobbyists’ Battle Cry Over Prices: Blame the Others |work=[[New York Times]] |date=2017-05-29 |accessdate=2017-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulatory issues ===
[[Ben Goldacre]] has argued that regulators – such as the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA) in the UK, or the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in the United States – advance the interests of the drug companies rather than the interests of the public due to revolving door exchange of employees between the regulator and the companies and friendships develop between regulator and company employees.&lt;ref name="bad"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldacre|first1=Ben|title=Bad pharma : how drug companies mislead doctors and harm patients|date=2014|isbn=9780865478060|pages=123–124|edition=First American Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that regulators do not require that new drugs offer an improvement over what is already available, or even that they be particularly effective.&lt;ref name="bad" /&gt;

Others have argued that excessive regulation suppresses therapeutic innovation, and that the current cost of regulator-required clinical trials prevents the full exploitation of new genetic and biological knowledge for the treatment of human disease.  A 2012 report by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology made several key recommendations to reduce regulatory burdens to new drug development, including 1) expanding the FDA's use of accelerated approval processes, 2) creating an expedited approval pathway for drugs intended for use in narrowly defined populations, and 3) undertaking pilot projects designed to evaluate the feasibility of a new, adaptive drug approval process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-fda-final.pdf |title=www.whitehouse.gov |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmaceutical fraud===
{{See also|List of largest pharmaceutical settlements in the United States}}
{{US-centric|section|date=August 2015}}
[[Pharmaceutical fraud]] involves deceptions which bring financial gain to a pharmaceutical company. It affects individuals and [[public health insurance|public]] and [[private health insurance|private insurers]]. There are several different schemes&lt;ref name="FBIFraudTypes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/fcs_report2006/financial-crimes-report-to-the-public-fiscal-year-2006#Health|publisher=FBI|year=2006|title=Financial Crimes to the Public Report 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; used to defraud the [[health care system]] which are particular to the pharmaceutical industry. These include: Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Violations, Off Label Marketing, Best Price Fraud, CME Fraud, Medicaid Price Reporting, and Manufactured Compound Drugs.&lt;ref name="FBIHealthCareGeneral"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/white_collar/health-care-fraud|title=FBI-Health Care Fraud|publisher=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of this amount $2.5 billion was recovered through ''False Claims Act'' cases in FY 2010. Examples of fraud cases include the [[GlaxoSmithKline]] $3 billion settlement, [[Pfizer]] $2.3 billion settlement and [[Merck &amp; Co.]] $650 million settlement. Damages from fraud can be recovered by use of the [[False Claims Act]], most commonly under the ''[[qui tam]]'' provisions which rewards an individual for being a "[[whistleblower]]", or [[relator (law)]].&lt;ref name="DOJHealthCareFraudReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/usao/tne/health_care.html|title=Department of Justice|publisher=Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every major company selling the antipsychotics — [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], [[Eli Lilly]], [[Pfizer]], [[AstraZeneca]] and [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] — has either settled recent government cases, under the False Claims Act, for hundreds of millions of dollars or is currently under investigation for possible health care fraud. Following charges of illegal marketing, two of the settlements set records last year for the largest criminal fines ever imposed on corporations. One involved Eli Lilly's antipsychotic [[Zyprexa]], and the other involved  [[Bextra]]. In the Bextra case, the government also charged Pfizer with illegally marketing another antipsychotic, [[Geodon]]; Pfizer settled that part of the claim for $301 million, without admitting any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=bied2010&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/business/03psych.html?_r=3&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Side Effects May Include Lawsuits |author=Duff Wilson |date=2 October 2010 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 2012, [[GlaxoSmithKline]] pleaded guilty to criminal charges and agreed to a $3 billion settlement of the largest health-care fraud case in the U.S. and the largest payment by a drug company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18673220| title=GlaxoSmithKline | date= 4 July 2012 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement is related to the company's illegal promotion of prescription drugs, its failure to report safety data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-02/glaxosmithkline-agrees-to-pay-3-billion-in-u-s-drug-settlement.html |title=GlaxoSmithKline Agrees to Pay $3 Billion in U.S. Drug Settlement |date=2 July 2012 | work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[bribing]] doctors, and promoting medicines for uses for which they were not licensed. The drugs involved were [[Paxil]], [[Wellbutrin]], [[Advair]], [[Lamictal]], and [[Zofran]] for off-label, non-covered uses. Those and the drugs [[Imitrex]], [[Lotronex]], [[Flovent]], and [[Valtrex]] were involved in the [[Kickback (bribery)|kickback scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/articles/wnyc-news/2012/jul/02/drug-giant-pays-record-setting-fine/|title=NY to Get Millions in GlaxoSmithKlein Settlement|author=Fred Mogul|publisher=[[WNYC]]|date=2 July 2012|accessdate=2 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419053720/http://www.wnyc.org/articles/wnyc-news/2012/jul/02/drug-giant-pays-record-setting-fine/|archivedate=19 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18673220|title=BBC News -GlaxoSmithKline to pay $3bn in US drug fraud scandal|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=2 July 2012|date=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/business/glaxosmithkline-agrees-to-pay-3-billion-in-fraud-settlement.html|title=Glaxo Agrees to Pay $3 Billion in Fraud Settlement|date=2 July 2012|author1=Thomas, Katie  |author2=Schmidt, Michael S. |lastauthoramp=yes |work=The New York Times|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a list of the four largest settlements reached with pharmaceutical companies from 1991 to 2012, rank ordered by the size of the total settlement.

==Developing world==

===Patents===
Patents have been criticized in the developing world, as they are thought to reduce access to existing medicines.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: 't Hoen, Ellen. "TRIPS, Pharmaceutical Patents, and Access to Essential Medicines: A Long Way from Seattle to Doha". ''Chicago Journal of International Law'', 27(43), 2002; Musungu, Sisule F., and Cecilia Oh. "The Use of Flexibilities in TRIPS by Developing Countries: Can They Provide Access to Medicines?" Commission on Intellectual Property Rights, Innovation and Public Health, The World Health Organization, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Reconciling patents and universal access to medicine would require an efficient international policy of [[Price discrimination#International price discrimination|price discrimination]]. Moreover, under the [[TRIPS]] agreement of the [[World Trade Organization]], countries must allow pharmaceutical products to be patented. In 2001, the WTO adopted the [[Doha Declaration]], which indicates that the TRIPS agreement should be read with the goals of public health in mind, and allows some methods for circumventing pharmaceutical monopolies: via [[compulsory licensing]] or [[parallel imports]], even before patent expiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Declaration on the TRIPS agreement and public health|url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min01_e/mindecl_trips_e.htm|publisher=World Trade Organization|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2001, 40 multi-national pharmaceutical companies brought litigation against [[South Africa]] for its [[Medicines and Related Substances Control Amendment Act, 1997|Medicines Act]], which allowed the generic production of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for treating HIV, despite the fact that these drugs were on-patent.&lt;ref&gt;"Pharmaceutical Manufacturer's Association v. The President of South Africa (PMA)", 2002 (2) SA 674 (CC) (S. Africa).&lt;/ref&gt; HIV was and is an [[epidemic]] in South Africa, and ARVs at the time cost between 10,000 and 15,000 USD per patient per year. This was unaffordable for most South African citizens, and so the South African government committed to providing ARVs at prices closer to what people could afford. To do so, they would need to ignore the patents on drugs and produce generics within the country (using a compulsory license), or import them from abroad. After international protest in favour of public health rights (including the collection of 250,000 signatures by [[Médecins Sans Frontières|MSF]]), the governments of several developed countries (including The Netherlands, Germany, France, and later the US) backed the South African government, and the case was dropped in April of that year.&lt;ref name="HelferAustin2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Laurence R. Helfer|author2=Graeme W. Austin|title=Human Rights and Intellectual Property: Mapping the Global Interface|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Suxwq8LXMdwC|date=7 March 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49691-9|pages=145–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, GlaxoSmithKline (the worlds 6th largest Pharmaceutical) announced that it would be dropping its patents in poor countries so as to allow independent companies to make and sell versions of its drugs in those areas, thereby widening the public access to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GlaxoSmithKline to 'drop patents in poor countries for better drug access'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-35933692|accessdate=19 May 2016|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; GlaxoSmithKline published a list of 50 countries they would no longer hold patents in, affecting 1 billion people worldwide.

===Charitable programs===
In 2011 four of the top 20 corporate charitable donations and eight of the top 30 corporate charitable donations came from pharmaceutical manufacturers.  The bulk of corporate charitable donations (69% as of 2012) comes by way of non-cash charitable donations, the majority of which again were donations contributed by pharmaceutical companies.  Some of those large pharmaceutical companies are “patient assistance” foundations, providing financial support to individuals in purchasing prescription medicines, but pharmaceutical companies are also huge givers of in-kind products, i.e. presumably their own drugs.  Non-cash donations of product can be "profit maximizing…as part of an inventory control issue when they have excess inventories” for some corporations, says Patrick Rooney of Giving USA in an interview with Nonprofit Quarterly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bumper Year for Corporate Donations Reveals Profit Motives|url=http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=15869|website=www.corpwatch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charitable programs and drug discovery &amp; development efforts by pharmaceutical companies include:
* "[[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]]'s Gift", wherein billions of [[river blindness]] drugs were donated in Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merk|url=http://www.cartercenter.org/healthprograms/showdoc.asp?programID%3D2%26submenu%3Dhealthprograms |accessdate=30 August 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826235817/http://www.cartercenter.org/healthprograms/showdoc.asp?programID=2&amp;submenu=healthprograms |archivedate=26 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pfizer]]'s gift of free/discounted [[fluconazole]] and other drugs for [[AIDS]] in [[South Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aegis.com/pubs/atn/2000/ATN34003.html Pfizer Will Donate Fluconazole to South Africa&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[GlaxoSmithKline|GSK]]'s commitment to give free albendazole tablets to the WHO for, and until, the elimination of [[lymphatic filariasis]] worldwide.
* In 2006, [[Novartis]] committed US$755 million in corporate citizenship initiatives around the world, particularly focusing on improving access to medicines in the developing world through its Access to Medicine projects, including donations of medicines to patients affected by [[leprosy]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]]; [[Glivec]] patient assistance programs; and relief to support major humanitarian organisations with emergency medical needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporate Responsibility: Novartis|url=https://www.novartis.com/about-us/corporate-responsibility|website=www.novartis.com|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2260">'''Premium Friday''' is a campaign to promote consumer spending advocated by the Japanese government and Japanese business organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kyodo|first1=Jiji|title=‘Premium Friday’ campaign draws little attention in Tokyo|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/03/04/business/survey-finds-3-7-percent-workers-left-early-first-premium-friday/#.WQAcz9KGOHs|accessdate=26 April 2017|agency=The Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had been expected to have a favorable effect to the movement to improve work style.

== Background ==
It is a campaign promoted by the Japanese business sector led by the [[Government of Japan]] and [[Japan Business Federation]] recommending to spend more enriched life every last Friday each month. Tied up with a movement to improve [[work style]], it is recommending to end work at 15:00. Since last Friday of a month end tends to be when salary has just been paid, it is advocating to spend the afternoon shopping or travelling. This has been implemented on February 24, 2017.

The initiative is part of an attempt to address the punishingly long hours many Japanese are expected to work, prompted by the suicide of a 24-year-old employee at the advertising firm [[Dentsu]] who was doing more than 100 hours' overtime in the months before her death. While some major companies, such as [[Honda]], the drinks maker [[Suntory]] and the confectioner [[Morinaga &amp; Company|Morinaga]], have adopted the optional scheme, others are less enthusiastic about the prospect of a mid-afternoon staff exodus. A survey of 155 big companies by the [[Nikkei Business Publications|Nikkei business]] newspaper showed that 45% had no immediate plans to implement the scheme, with 37% saying they had either decided to enter into the spirit of Premium Friday or had plans to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/24/premium-fridays-japan-gives-workers-break-go-shopping|title=Premium Fridays: Japan gives its workers a break – to go shopping|last=McCurry|first=Justin|date=2017-02-24|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-23|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting changes to the mother's [[Endocrine system|hormonal]] and [[immune system]] may harm the fetus's (and after birth, the infant's) immune function and [[brain development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal= Adv Nurs Sci |date=2005 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=345–55 |title= Effects of maternal prenatal stress on infant outcomes: a synthesis of the literature |vauthors=Ruiz RJ, Avant KC |pmid=16292020 |doi=10.1097/00012272-200510000-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2010.06.002|journal= Brain Res Rev |date=2010 |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=56–79 |title= Prenatal stress and brain development |vauthors=Charil A, Laplante DP, Vaillancourt C, King S |pmid=20550950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prenatal stress is shown to have several affects in fetal brain development. In the hippocampus of adult male rats, prenatal stress has shown to decrease the rate of proliferation and cell death in the hypothalamus-pituitary axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Baquedano E, García-Cáceres C, Diz-Chaves Y, Lagunas N, Calmarza-Font I, Azcoitia I, Garcia-Segura LM, Argente J, Chowen JA, Frago LM |title=Prenatal stress induces long-term effects in cell turnover in the hippocampus-hypothalamus-pituitary axis in adult male rats |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=e27549 |year=2011 |pmid=22096592 |pmc=3212572 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0027549 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prenatal stressed animals have prolonged corticosterone response. Removing the [[adrenal glands]] of the mother eliminates the effect of the pup's corticosterone response. Supplementing the [[Adrenalectomy|adrenalectamized]] mother with [[corticosterone]], rescued the [[HPA axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-axis]] response to maternal stress for prenatally stressed offspring. Prenatal stress caused high [[glucocorticoids]], which in turn affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis negative feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barbazanges A, Piazza PV, Le Moal M, Maccari S |title=Maternal glucocorticoid secretion mediates long-term effects of prenatal stress |journal=J.

A study by García-Cáceres et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=García-Cáceres C, Lagunas N, Calmarza-Font I, Azcoitia I, Diz-Chaves Y, García-Segura LM, Baquedano E, Frago LM, Argente J, Chowen JA |title=Gender differences in the long-term effects of chronic prenatal stress on the HPA axis and hypothalamic structure in rats |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=35 |issue=10 |pages=1525–35 |date=November 2010 |pmid=20558007 |doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2010.05.006 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306-4530(10)00136-8|hdl=10261/62340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that prenatal stress decreases cell turnover and proliferation in the hypothalamus of adult rats, which reduces structural plasticity and reduces the response to stress in adulthood. This study also showed that when prenatally stressed rats were stressed in adulthood the females showed an increase in [[corticotropin-releasing hormone ]] suggesting it to be an up-regulation in the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis. Males showed no elevation of corticosterone levels. Increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone with no effect of adult stress and a decrease in the corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA in the hypothalamus showed a down-regulation. The author concludes that this makes prenatally stressed females less reactive to later life stressors than males.

==Prenatal stress and gender differences in hormones==
Pups that underwent prenatal stress showed lower plasma testosterone when compared to the control pups. This is caused by the disruption of prenatal development which did not allow the complete masculinization of the prenatally stressed pups’ central nervous system. Particularly in the striatum of the prenatally stressed male pups showed an increase in [[vanilmandelic acid]], [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]], [[5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid]] which all can affect sexual behavior. The prenatally stressed male pups showed a significant latency in mounting behavior when compared to controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerardin DC, Pereira OC, Kempinas WG, Florio JC, Moreira EG, Bernardi MM |title=Sexual behavior, neuroendocrine, and neurochemical aspects in male rats exposed prenatally to stress |journal=Physiol. Behav. |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=97–104 |date=January 2005 |pmid=15642612 |doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2004.10.014 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0031-9384(04)00464-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When doing the [[radial arm maze]] task prenatally stressed male rats showed a greater increase in dopamine than the prenatally stressed females, which is suggested to facilitate the impairment for the males doing the maze task, but improved the female’s performance. There was also an effect on the corticosterone secretion for prenatally stressed females. Being prenatally stressed increased the anxiety response of the female rats. Yet, it had no effect on the males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bowman RE, MacLusky NJ, Sarmiento Y, Frankfurt M, Gordon M, Luine VN |title=Sexually dimorphic effects of prenatal stress on cognition, hormonal responses, and central neurotransmitters |journal=Endocrinology |volume=145 |issue=8 |pages=3778–87 |date=August 2004 |pmid=15142991 |doi=10.1210/en.2003-1759 |url=http://endo.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15142991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexually dimorphic brain regions==
Prenatal stress does have an effect on brain sexual differentiation after measuring the volume of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area of both female and males in the control and stressed groups. Prenatal stress inhibits the masculinzation of the male brain by inhibiting the growth of the [[Sexually dimorphic nucleus|sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area]]. Previous studies found that a decrease in testosterone is seen in pups of prenatally stressed mothers. Authors suggest this may cause the reduced in the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area and says it is similar to the effects of neonatal castration. Also, stressed males had larger sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area at birth, but then at 20 and 60 days are found to only have 50% of the volume of the control males. Whereas control males are two times larger than control females on days 20 and 60, but the stressed males show no statistical difference to control females on respective days. These findings show support that the male brain is not showing the expected sexual dimorphism when prenatally stressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson DK, Rhees RW, Fleming DE |title=Effects of prenatal stress on differentiation of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) of the rat brain |journal=Brain Res. |volume=332 |issue=1 |pages=113–8 |date=April 1985 |pmid=3995257 |doi= 10.1016/0006-8993(85)90394-4|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0006-8993(85)90394-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another study led by Kerchner et al. investigated the volume of the medial [[amygdala]] and the two compartments posterodorsal and the posteroventral in mice that also were prenatally stressed. Posterodorsal is thought to show organizational and activational effects from [[gonadal steroids]]. The medial amygdala for the control and stressed males was 85% larger than females with the males (stressed and control) resembling each other. To look for specific regions within the medial amygdala that may have been affected, data showed that both the posterodorsal and posteroventral, all male groups were larger in volume than the females, but male groups did not significantly differ from each other. This study confirmed that the medial amygdala is sexually dimorphic; the males are larger than the females. The posterodorsal and posteroventral were shown to be sexually dimorphic too. The writer suggested that these areas may act similarly to sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area in response to testosterone, but prenatal stress did not show an effect on the medial amygdala as it does on the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area. Also, the posteroventral was 40% larger in control males than females. These results were thought to be caused by the sensitive period of the medial amygdala which is in the first days after birth. The medial amygdala, posterodorsal and posteroventral all show to be resistant against demasculinization from prenatal stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kerchner M, Malsbury CW, Ward OB, Ward IL |title=Sexually dimorphic areas in the rat medial amygdala: resistance to the demasculinizing effect of prenatal stress |journal=Brain Res. |volume=672 |issue=1–2 |pages=251–60 |date=February 1995 |pmid=7749746 |doi= 10.1016/0006-8993(94)01378-U|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0006-8993(94)01378-U}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prenatal stress and gender roles==
A longitudinal study done on prenatal stress and gender roles showed that prenatal stress only plays a small part in the gender roles the offspring takes on and mentions it has more to do with older siblings, maternal use of alcohol and/or tobacco, maternal education, and the observance or teaching of “traditional sex roles” from the parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hines M, Johnston KJ, Golombok S, Rust J, Stevens M, Golding J |title=Prenatal stress and gender role behavior in girls and boys: a longitudinal, population study |journal=Horm Behav |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=126–34 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12367566 |doi= 10.1006/hbeh.2002.1814|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0018506X02918143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prenatal stress and mindfulness-based interventions==
Prenatal stress and negative mood during pregnancy has been shown to increase the risk for poor childbirth outcomes and postnatal maternal mood problems. Additionally, prenatal distress can interfere with the mother-infant attachment and child development outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authors=P.D. Wadha, C.A. Sandman, T.J. Garite |title=The neurobiology of stress in human pregnancy: implications for prematurity and development of the fetal central nervous system. |journal=Progress in Brain Research |volume=133 |pages=131–142 |date=2001 |doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(01)33010-8|isbn=9780444505484 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authors=Bonari, L., Pinto, N., Ahn, E., Einarson, A.,  Wadha |title=The neurobiology of stress in human pregnancy: implications for prematurity and development of the fetal central nervous system.  |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=49  |issue=11 |pages=726–35 |date=2004 |doi= 10.1016/S0079-6123(01)33010-8|series=Progress in Brain Research  |isbn=9780444505484  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the clear association between prenatal stress and child outcomes, frequently women do not receive screening, prevention, or treatment for mood or stress concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Flynn, H.

Given the relationship between prenatal stress and child outcomes, it is essential to examine interventions that aim to reduce anxiety, depression, and stress during pregnancy. Mindfulness based stress reduction has been demonstrated to reduce anxiety and depression for people with stress-related and chronic medical conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Astin, J.A., Shapiro S.L., Eisenberg D.M., Forys K.L. |title=Mind-body medicine: state of the science, implications for practice. |journal=The Journal of the American Board of Family Practice |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=131–147 |date=2003 |doi= 10.3122/jabfm.16.2.131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One pilot study shows promise for the potential of a mindfulness-based intervention to reduce negative affect and anxiety of women during pregnancy. Based out of the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute, investigators Dr. Cassandra Vieten and Dr. John Astin conducted a wait-list control pilot study that tested a group-based mindfulness intervention. There were 31 women enrolled in the study: 13 women were assigned to the intervention and 18 women were assigned to the control group.  Measures of anxiety, negative affect, positive affect, depression, mindfulness, perceived stress, and affect regulation were taken before intervention or control was assigned and after the intervention or control was completed. Measures were repeated at a follow-up visit 3 months after the intervention or control was completed. The investigators found a significant decrease in anxiety (p&lt;.05) and negative affect (p &lt;.04) in women who completed the mindfulness based intervention, but not a significant decrease in depression, positive affect, mindfulness, affect regulation, and perceived stress. These results suggest that mindfulness intervention during pregnancy reduce anxiety and negative affect of mothers.  This study is a promising start to the potential impact that mindfulness based interventions could have on reducing prenatal stress, and thereby improving child outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Veiten, C., &amp; Astin, J. |title=Effects of a mindfulness-based intervention during pregnancy on prenatal stress and mood: Results of a pilot study.  |journal=Archives of Women's Mental Health  |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=67–74 |date=2008 |doi= 10.1007/s00737-008-0214-3|pmid=18317710  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timing of Prenatal Stress and Impact on Development ==
A study by Sandman and Davis &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Elysia P.|last2=Sandman|first2=Curt A.|date=2010|title=The Timing of Prenatal Exposure to Maternal Cortisol and Psychosocial Stress Is Associated With Human Infant Cognitive Development|jstor=40598969|journal=Child Development|volume=81|issue=1|pages=131–148|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2009.01385.x|pmid=20331658|pmc=2846100}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that the timing of prenatal stress is crucial to understanding how prenatal stress affects prenatal and postnatal development. Cortisol is often used to measure stress as it is a hormone that is released during stressful events. If an expectant mother is experiencing a stressful event such as income insecurity or being a teenage mother, cortisol is secreted as a result. However, as demonstrated by Sandman and Davis, the timing of cortisol release can sometimes have a harmful effect on development and sometimes not depending on when in pregnancy stress is experienced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sandman and Davis studied "125 full- term infants at 3, 6, and 12 months of age"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to determine the effects of maternal cortisol timing differences on development. They found that "exposure to elevated concentrations of cortisol early in gestation was associated with a slower rate of development over the 1st year and lower mental development scores at 12 months" and "elevated levels of maternal cortisol late in gestation were associated with accelerated cognitive development and higher scores at 12 months".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Overall, cortisol's effects on infant cognitive development are dependent upon the timing of cortisol release.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Road Safety Authority''' ({{lang-ga|Údarás Um Shábháilteacht Ar Bhóithre}}), or '''RSA''', is a state agency formed by the [[Irish Government]] to promote [[road safety]] within the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The agency has devolved control of much of the work of the [[Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport]].

== History and Governance ==
It was established in September 2006, charged with the task of improving safety on the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s roads and established under the ''Road Safety Authority Act 2006'', in response to the [[List of countries by traffic-related death rate|high number of deaths]] on Irish roads.&lt;ref name="rsa"&gt;{{cite web| title=Welcome to the Road Safety Authority | publisher =Road Safety Authority | url=
http://www.rsa.ie/ | accessdate =2009-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation's headquarters are located at Primrose Hill, Ballina, Co. Mayo. The current chairperson of the RSA is former TD [[Liz O'Donnell]] who succeeded veteran TV and radio celebrity, former host of the Late Late Show [[Gay Byrne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Gay Byrne named head of Road Safety Authority | publisher=[[Irish Times]] | date =2006-03-03 | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2006/0327/breaking50.html | accessdate=2009-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Byrne secured a second 5-year term in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/motors/2011/1102/1224306905920.html |title=Hard Shoulder|work =[[Irish Times]]|date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 16 June 2014, he announced his intention to step down as Chairman on 5 August 2014.

Some controversy was caused when Mr. Byrne was shown traveling in a car with [[Terry Wogan]] when Mr. Byrne appeared not to be wearing his seatbelt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.examiner.ie/home/do-as-i-say-not-as-i-do-gaybo-caught-wearing-seatbelt-incorrectly-143899.html|title=Do as I say, not as I do: Gaybo caught wearing seatbelt incorrectly|work=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=01/02/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Byrne has also admitted to drink driving in the past, "but said it was part of the Irish culture at the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/i-drank-and-drove-home-from-late-late-says-gay-1801757.html|work=Irish Independent|title=I drank and drove home from Late Late, says Gay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSA was mentioned in relation to public agencies continuing to operate outside of the remit of the [[Data Protection Commissioner|Office of the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner]], in a speech delivered by [[Emily O'Reilly]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ombudsman.gov.ie/en/SpeechesandArticles/Ombudsmansspeeches/Name,11772,en.htm|title=Address by Emily O'Reilly - Ombudsman and Information Commissioner at Institute of Public Administration &amp; Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accounting - Conference on Good Governance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the CEO of the RSA, [[Noel Brett]] stepped down from his position as chief executive of the State-funded Road Safety Authority (RSA) to take up a position as chief lobbyist for the [[Irish Banking Federation]] :

''"His appointment will come as a surprise given his lack of experience in the financial services sector, especially when the main banks in Ireland are striving to return to profitability and are under significant pressure to deal with the issue of mortgage arrears."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/sectors/financial-services/road-safety-chief-noel-brett-appointed-as-head-of-banking-industry-lobby-group-1.1488761 | title=as head of banking industry lobby group | work=Irish Times | date=August 9, 2013 | accessdate=August 16, 2018 | author=Hancock, Ciarán }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions ==
Amongst the functions of the RSA are the promotion of road safety, research on accidents and road safety, driver testing and licensing, as well as establishing vehicle-related and other safe driving standards.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web| title=About Us | publisher =Road Safety Authority | url=http://www.rsa.ie/Utility/About-Us/Key-facts/ | accessdate =2009-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSA and An Garda Síochána enforce the licensing provisions of the Road Transport Acts: "As well as a fine, if you are an unlicensed haulier you can expect the RSA to look closely at your compliance with other laws, such as those covering: Drivers’ hours rules, Road traffic requirements, Roadworthiness of your vehicles and trailers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsa.ie/RSA/Professional-Drivers/Owners-and-managers/Road-haulage-enforcement/ |publisher=RSA.ie |title=Road haulage enforcement |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331040126/http://www.rsa.ie/RSA/Professional-Drivers/Owners-and-managers/Road-haulage-enforcement/ |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSA is also responsible for monitoring progress of The National Road Safety Strategy (2007-2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.rsa.ie/publication/publication/upload/822_RSA_Strategy_ENG.pdf |title=National Road Safety Strategy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219130333/http://rsa.ie/publication/publication/upload/822_RSA_Strategy_ENG.pdf |archivedate=19 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to reduce collisions, deaths and injuries on Irish roads by 30%. Achieving this would bring Ireland in line with countries that are considered to have the safest roads in the world – such as Holland, Sweden and the UK.

Under the banner of [http://www.ndls.ie NDLS] (National Driver Licence Service) the RSA is now responsible for the issuing of [http://www.adidriving.ie/forms-and-resources/ driving licences] in Ireland.

==Initiatives==
The RSA's "He drives, she dies" campaign, which aimed to raise awareness among female drivers of the risks of getting into cars with men they feel may not drive safely, came in for some criticism in the Irish media. The country's [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland|Broadcasting Complaints Commission]] also received a number of complaints from members of the public relating to the campaign. RSA Chief Executive Noel Brett defended the campaign as justified by accident statistics, saying that "women need to know that they are being killed through male-dominated driver errors such as speeding and drink driving," adding "male drivers are four times more likely to be involved in a fatal collision than a female driver." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/national-news/he-drives-she-dies-campaign-is-sexist---gerry-1852819.html|title=He Drives, She Dies campaign is sexist -- Gerry|date=6 August 2009|publisher=Herald.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribune.ie/news/article/2009/jul/19/male-drivers-disgusted-by-rsas-sexist-ad-campaign|title=Male drivers 'disgusted' by RSA's 'sexist' ad campaign|date=19 July 2009|publisher=Tribune.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authority subsequently announced it was considering a number of practical options to further its aim to cut death rates among the country's young male drivers, including the possibility of a late-night driving curfew for all male drivers under the age of 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/driving-curfew-proposed-to-save-young-mens-lives-1868264.html | work =Irish Independent | first=Anne | last=Lucey | title=Driving curfew proposed to save young men's lives | date=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other recent initiatives include the recommendation of a number of changes to Ireland's [[National Car Test]], which is supervised by the RSA, requiring vehicles older than ten years to be tested every year as opposed to biennially, while stricter controls will be introduced on non-functioning fault warning lights, overly noisy exhausts, and tinted windows and windscreens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/motors/2009/1216/1224260753473.html | work=The Irish Times | title=NCT every year for older cars | date=2009-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the Road Safety Authority received information from vehicle checking agency [[Cartell]] about the issue of written off cars from the UK being imported, repaired and registered for use in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'', [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/motors/2008/0116/1200260550417.html Repaired write-offs back on the roads], Wed 1 Jan 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent ''[[Irish Times]]'' article provoked an investigation by the Garda Siochána, Vehicle Registration Unit, Road Safety Authority and Revenue Commissioners. This resulted in a change to legislation so that from September 2010 all imported vehicles must be taken to a National Car Test Centre for inspection before being registered in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;NCTS website, [http://www.ncts.ie/vrt.html "VRT Bookings"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226183458/http://www.ncts.ie/vrt.html |date=26 December 2012 }}, retrieved 21 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, it was announced that the RSA had struck an agreement under which the disqualification of drivers in Ireland and in the UK will be mutually recognised. The accord, which is the first such deal between two EU member states, will come into effect in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Cross-border deal will target banned drivers|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/crossborder-deal-will-target-banned-drivers-14599390.html|date=16 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 [[RTÉ]] revealed that individuals in some of the National Car Testing Service centres could issue an NCT car safety certificate on payment of €100 for cars with serious safety defects. The tests are subcontracted to and conducted by Applus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/0517/taxi.html|title=RTÉ on the NCT|date=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011 Ireland's improvement in reducing road safety fatalities enabled it to be ranked in sixth place for road safety in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/report-irish-roads-six-safest-in-europe-509852.html|title=Report: Irish roads 'six safest in Europe'|date=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RSA stated: "The number of Irish road deaths fell to 212 in 2010, the lowest level on record, down 26 from 2009. The Government’s road safety target of achieving no more than 252 deaths per annum by the end of 2012 was achieved three years ahead of schedule."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsa.ie/RSA/Road-Safety/Our-Research/Deaths-injuries-on-Irish-roads/|title=Deaths and injuries on Irish roads}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 October 2011, the RSA announced a joint venture with the Irish Tyre Industry Association with the intention of promoting a "tyre safety" week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsa.ie/Utility/News/2011/RSA-and-ITIA-launch-National-Tyre-Safety-Day/ |date=5 October 2011 |title=RSA and ITIA launch 'National Tyre Safety Day' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222021550/http://rsa.ie/Utility/News/2011/RSA-and-ITIA-launch-National-Tyre-Safety-Day/ |archivedate=22 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later the RSA issued a fresh announcement distancing itself from the practical demonstration of vehicle stopping distances it had earlier endorsed after it was alleged that one of the test vehicles used in the tyre safety demonstration had had its ABS braking system disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsa.ie/Utility/News/2011/Statement-Regarding-Tyre-Safety-Demo-Aired-on-RTE-TV-News/ |title=Statement Regarding Tyre Safety Demo Aired on RTÉ TV News |date=7 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117033446/http://rsa.ie/Utility/News/2011/Statement-Regarding-Tyre-Safety-Demo-Aired-on-RTE-TV-News/ |archivedate=17 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the RSA, having been consulted to offer an opinion on a [https://web.archive.org/web/20130621175213/http://www.asai.ie/complaint_view.asp?CID=1008&amp;BID=49 TV advertisement] for Meteor (a mobile telephone service provider), concluded that "they were of the view that the advertisement promoted highly dangerous road user behaviour."

The advertisement included a comedic segment showing a cyclist following a bus to receive free wifi.
Whilst the cyclist depicted in the Meteor ad was wearing a helmet, he was using a mobile phone whilst riding a bicycle.

'''Smoking in Iran''' has been [[smoking ban|banned]] in all public places since 2007. This includes all state bodies, hotels, restaurants. The law also bans the smoking of traditional waterpipes (''[[ghalyun]]'') which were common in Iranian [[tea house]]s. A smoking ban for all car drivers nationwide was implemented in March 2006, and although offenders can face fines, the ban has been widely ignored. The sale of tobacco products to anyone under the age of 18 is prohibited and is punishable by the confiscation of the vendor's tobacco products and a fine.

About 20% of the adult male and 4.5% of the adult female population smoke tobacco (12 million smokers according to some estimates).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-235/0812241246201050.htm |title=وب سایتهای ایرنا - Irna |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217191537/http://www2.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-235/0812241246201050.htm |archivedate=2012-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/09/jun/1006.html |title=25% of death in Iran caused by tobacco: Minister |publisher=Payvand.com |date=2009-05-31 |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 60,000 Iranians die directly or indirectly due to smoking every year (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smokersclubinc.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1834 |title=Iran Compulsory Rules |publisher=The Smokers Club, Inc. |date=2007-12-22 |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoking is responsible for 25% of deaths in the country.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Approx. 54-60 billion cigarettes are believed to be consumed annually in Iran.&lt;ref name="New law"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3446">The '''STROBE''' ''('''ST'''rengthening the '''R'''eporting of '''OB'''servational studies in '''E'''pidemiology)'' Statement is a reporting guideline including a checklist of 22 items that are considered essential for good reporting of [[observational studies]].
It has been published in several leading biomedical journals in October and November 2007 and is referred to in the [[Vancouver guidelines]] (Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals) established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.

== Purpose ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The STROBE Statement was developed by the STROBE Initiative, an international collaboration of epidemiologists, methodologists, statisticians, researchers and journal editors with the aim to assist authors when writing up analytical observational studies, to support editors and reviewers when considering such articles for publication, and to help readers when critically appraising published articles.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=von Elm|first1=E|last2=Altman|first2=DG|last3=Egger|first3=M|last4=Pocock|first4=SJ|last5=Gøtzsche|first5=PC|last6=Vandenbroucke|first6=JP|last7=STROBE|first7=Initiative.|title=The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement: guidelines for reporting observational studies.|journal=PLoS Medicine|date=16 October 2007|volume=4|issue=10|pages=e296|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040296|pmid=17941714|pmc=2020495}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Extensions ==
Extensions to STROBE include RECORD, for "The REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected Data".&lt;ref name=Benchimol-2015&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Benchimol EI, Smeeth L, Guttmann A, et al |title=The REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected health Data (RECORD) Statement |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=12 |issue=10 |pages=e1001885|year=2015 |pmid=26440803 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001885 |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001885 |pmc=4595218}}&lt;/ref&gt; RECORD is intended for observational studies using routinely collected health data, such as health administrative data, electronic health records, and registry data.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.record-statement.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''voluntary termination of pregnancy''' is a proposed [[abortion law]] bill in [[Argentina]]. 

==Contents==
The text of the bill only uses the term "[[abortion]]" when it makes references to articles of the [[Penal Code of Argentina|penal code]], that would be modified. In all other cases, it uses the term "voluntary termination of pregnancy".&lt;ref name="perlas"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/2018/06/12/las-perlas-del-proyecto-de-legalizacion-del-aborto-que-se-vota-en-diputados/|title= Las "perlas" del proyecto de legalización del aborto que se vota en Diputados|trans-title= The "pearls" of the abortion legalization project voted by deputees|language= Spanish|author= Claudia Peiro|date= June 12, 2018|publisher= Infobae|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also makes reference to both women and people that may become pregnant, in reference to cases of [[transgender pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.clarin.com/sociedad/aborto-proyecto-refiere-mujeres-personas-gestantes_0_B1cNbapxX.html|title= Aborto: por qué el proyecto se refiere a "mujeres y personas gestantes"|trans-title= Abortion: Why does the project talk about "women and people that may become pregnant"|language= Spanish|author= |date= June 12, 2018|publisher= Clarín|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An abortion may be performed during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, with no requirements other than the woman's desire. After that point, an abortion may be performed in the case of [[rape]], risk to the life or health of the woman, or risk of [[stillbirth]]. Those three cases may allow abortion at any point of the pregnancy, even in its last stages. In the case of rape, a woman only needs to sign an oath, without needing to make a [[criminal complaint]]. [[Minor (law)|Minors]] do not require parental authorization to abort. There is no limit on the number of times a woman may perform abortions.&lt;ref name="perlas"/&gt;

Once the woman informs her desire to abort, the healthcare facility has a maxium of five days to perform it. The pre-abortion interviews are restricted to information about abortion methods, and may not attempt to discourage the woman from aborting. The process must keep discretion about the identity of the woman. All healcare facilities, both public and private, must guarantee to perform abortions in the time required and for free. Judicial authorizations are not needed.&lt;ref name="perlas"/&gt;

Medics are allowed to claim themselves [[conscientious objector]]s, by signing a registry beforehand. This can only be done on a personal level, healthcare facilities are not allowed to do so, even those founded by religious organizations.&lt;ref name="perlas"/&gt; 

The bill also instructs the establishment of [[sex education]] in schools and policies to prevent unwanted pregnancies, although those had already been in place. It also instructs the creation of abortion-related statistics.&lt;ref name="perlas"/&gt;

The sanctions in the penal code remain for the cases when a medic performs an abortion without the woman's authorization. A medic that performs an abortion after the 15th week of pregnancy without it being among the accepted cases may be sentenced to prison, from three months to a year. A medic who delays, obstructs or refuses to perform an abortion may be sentenced to prison, from six months to two years, and with a disqualification for the double of time. If this refusal led to the birth of the baby, the sentence raises from two to five years.&lt;ref name="perlas"/&gt;

President [[Mauricio Macri]] encouraged the discussion of an [[abortion law]] during the [[2018 opening of regular sessions of the National Congress of Argentina]].&lt;ref name="revivi"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2113185-mauricio-macri-congreso-discurso-apertura-sesiones-legislativas-2018|title= Mauricio Macri en el Congreso: reviví el minuto a minuto de la Asamblea Legislativa|trans-title= Mauricio Macri in the Congress, relive the minute by minute of the Legislative assembly|language= Spanish|author= |date= March 1, 2018|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some months of [[abortion debate]] in the media, the bill was approved by the internal commisions of the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]] for general legislation, health, penal legislation and family. It was approved by 64 to 57 votes, which allowed it to be discussed by the chamber itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2143301-el-proyecto-para-la-despenalizacion-del-aborto-obtuvo-dictamen-en-comision-64-votos-a-favor-57-en-contra|title= El proyecto para la despenalización del aborto obtuvo dictamen en comisión: 64 votos a favor, 57 en contra|trans-title= The project for the legalization of abortion got dictum in the committees: 64 for, 57 against|language= Spanish|author= Laura Serra|date= June 12, 2018|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was approved by the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies]] by a narrow margin of 129 to 125 votes. The proposal divided both the legislators of [[Cambiemos]] and the [[Justicialist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-abortion/argentina-lower-house-passes-legal-abortion-bill-in-tight-vote-idUSKBN1JA1ZT|title= Argentina lower house passes legal abortion bill in tight vote|author= |date= June 14, 2018|publisher= Reuters|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political reactions==
===Cambiemos===
[[Elisa Carrió]], one of the most influential figures of the official government coalition, is a strong pro-life advocate. She suspected that some legislators were instructed to vote in support of the bill, and threatened to leave the coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2152043-macri-recibio-anoche-a-la-ucr-para-limar-asperezas-tras-las-criticas-de-carrio|title= Macri recibió anoche a la UCR para limar asperezas tras las críticas de Carrió|trans-title= Macri met the UCR tonight to make amends after the criticisms of Carrió|language= Spanish|author= Mariano Obarrio|date= July 11, 2018|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Víctor Fernández, archbishop of [[La Plata]], asked the president to use a [[veto]] against the law, if he was truly against abortion. [[Marcos Peña]], chief of the cabinet of ministers, confirmed that Macri would honor the result of the discussion, and would not veto the bill if approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2151980-pena-insistio-en-que-macri-no-vetara-la-ley-si-es-sancionada|title= Debate por el aborto: Peña insistió en que Macri no vetará la ley si es sancionada|trans-title= Abortion debate: Peña insisted that Macri will not veto the law if approved|language= Spanish|author= Jaime Rosemberg|date= July 11, 2018|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peronism===
The Peronist factions in Argentina (the [[Justicialist Party]], the [[Renewal Front]] and the [[Front for Victory]]) are also divided over the project. During the preliminary discussions in the Senate, there were conflicting views over the chance of doctors refusing to perform abortions as [[conscientious objector]]s. [[Miguel Pichetto]] opposed it, claiming that everybody should obey the law. [[José Mayans]] considered instead that a state-enforced killing would be similar to a [[capital punishment]], which is not allowed in the Argentine legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2152109-fuerte-pelea-entre-senadores-del-pj-por-el-aborto|title= Fuerte pelea entre senadores del PJ durante el debate por el aborto|trans-title= Strong clash between senators of the PJ during the abortion debate|language= Spanish|author= Gustavo Ybarra|date= July 11, 2018|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[Guillermo Snopek]], who is against abortion, requested that the minister of health [[Adolfo Rubinstein]] was not allowed to make a speech during the preliminary discussions in the senate. He considered that such a speech could influence the legislators and be a breach to the [[separation of powers]]. He also accused him of having ties with the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2155653-aborto-impugnan-la-presentacion-del-ministro-rubinstein|title= Aborto: impugnan la presentación de Rubinstein en el Senado|trans-title= Abortion: they reject the speech of Rubinstein in the senate|language= Spanish|author= Gustavo Ybarra|date= July 23, 2018|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The request was dismissed, and Rubinstein made his speech without problems. He clarified that he was not talking in the name of the government but just of the ministry of health, and that he only intended to provide relevant statistics, and not engage in the moral aspects of the abortion debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2156044-los-cruces-con-el-ministro-rubinstein-dominaron-la-audiencia-sobre-el-aborto|title= Los cruces con el ministro Rubinstein dominaron la audiencia sobre el aborto|trans-title= The discussions with minister Rubinstein dominated the abortion summit|language= Spanish|author= Gustavo Ybarra|date= July 25, 2018|publisher= La Nación|accessdate=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
