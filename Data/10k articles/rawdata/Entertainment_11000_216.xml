'''''5 Against the House''''' is a 1955 American [[heist film]] [[film noir|noir]] directed by [[Phil Karlson]] and starring [[Guy Madison]], [[Brian Keith]], and [[Kim Novak]], in one of her first film appearances. Based on a story by [[Jack Finney]], the film centers on a fictional robbery of what was a real [[Nevada]] casino, [[Harold's Club]]. The supporting cast includes [[William Conrad]].  The screenplay was based on [[Jack Finney]]'s 1954 novel of the same name, which was later serialized by ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{AFI film|id=51499|title=5 Against the House}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
During a weekend side-trip to [[Reno, Nevada]], college friends Brick (Keith), Al (Madison), Ronnie ([[Kerwin Mathews]]) and Roy ([[Alvy Moore]]) visit the Harold's Club casino.

After an hour spent gambling and socializing, the group prepares to leave. Ronnie, however, has lost money playing roulette and must cash a check at the cashier's window. He is accompanied there by Roy but, unbeknownst to either of them, the cashier is being threatened by a man with a gun. Using a concealed security alarm, the cashier alerts casino officials, who apprehend not only the would-be robber, but also Roy and Ronnie. Al persuades the police to release Roy and Ronnie, but the inquisitive Ronnie has become obsessed with the idea of a spectacular casino robbery, and he begins forming his own plans to rob Harold's Club after he overhears one of the police officers say, "There's no way it [robbing Harold's Club] can be done."

Back at college, the incident is seemingly forgotten, though Ronnie begins developing his plans in earnest. Al also reestablishes his relationship with his girlfriend, Kaye (Kim Novak), who has recently become a singer at a local nightclub. Al takes Brick, Roy and Ronnie to see one of her shows. After the performance, Brick, a [[Korean War]] veteran, is provoked into fighting a fellow student over a former girlfriend and, afterward, he suffers from the effects of a dissociative [[psychotic episode]] due to an ongoing battle with [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]. Later that night, Al encourages a distraught Brick to return to a veteran’s hospital for treatment, but he refuses.

Later, Ronnie finalizes his plan to rob Harold’s Club. Claiming that the robbery would be an adventurous "first" in their otherwise ordinary lives, Ronnie reveals the plan to Brick and Roy, maintaining that all the money would be returned, thereby ensuring that no one involved would be guilty of a prosecutable crime. Though initially skeptical, Brick and Roy gradually abandon their misgivings. The wealthy Ronnie then uses his personal inheritance funds to purchase an untraceable trailer and car and fabricate a wooden cart that is identical to the cash carts used at Harold's — the most important component of the heist.

Ronnie determines that the robbery can only go ahead if Al participates, maintaining that at least four people will be needed for the dangerously complex operation. But Brick, Roy and Ronnie agree that Al will not go along with the robbery if he is made aware of it beforehand. Coincidentally, the day before the robbery, Al proposes to Kaye, and they decide to go to Reno with the others to get married right away.

On the way to Reno, Al recognizes the cart's design while riding in the trailer and inadvertently turns on a small reel-to-reel recorder hidden inside the cart itself and listens to a sinister recording. Ronnie reveals his robbery plans to Kaye and Al. Shocked, they refuse to participate.

Brick then pulls out a revolver and seizes control. Fearing a life of destitution and confinement, the increasingly volatile and disturbed Brick explains that the robbery will go ahead as intended, but with one difference: the money will not be returned. Brick threatens to kill Al if anyone attempts to sabotage the plan.

Once they arrive at the casino, the robbery is carried out efficiently as Reno’s casino district is filled with costumed partiers celebrating a cowboy-themed [[fête]]. In the chaotic festivities, the disguised Brick, Ronnie and Al blend into the crowd and convince a cart operator ([[William Conrad]]) to retrieve cash from the money room, using the prerecorded message to make him believe that there is a desperate man with a gun in the cart who will shoot him if he does not cooperate.

After the robbery, Brick leaves the others behind and escapes with the money, but Al pursues him into a casino parking structure. Kaye, having alerted police, follows them, and a tense standoff ensues. Ultimately, Al convinces Brick to give up peacefully. No one else is arrested and Al and Kaye embrace on a crowded street.

==Reception==
[[File:BrianKeith5house.jpg|right|thumb|[[Brian Keith]] in the trailer]]
The film was praised upon its release by A. H. Weiler, the film critic at ''[[The New York Times]]'', who cited, "brisk direction, crisp, idiomatic and truly comic dialogue" as being chief among its positive qualities, but held reservations about the film's development of characters and back-story.&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B06E7D6133AE53BBC4952DFB066838E649EDE Wiler, A.H].

Accessed: August 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary reviewer Richard Harland Smith has reported that Kim Novak received "favorable, albeit condescending reviews" for her portrayal of "night-club chanteuse" Kaye Greylek, which improved her status at Columbia Pictures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/thismonth/article.jsp?cid=202631 Smith, Richard Harland].

==Influence==
Released in 1955, ''5 Against the House'' is an early example of a filmed [[Heist film|heist]], and an early film depiction of casino-robbery, to be later typified by, among others, ''[[Ocean's 11]]'', its remake and sequels. [[Martin Scorsese]] has indicated that his 1995 film ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'' was influenced by Karlson's own production.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Richard Harland. Ibid. Accessed: August 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==
On November 3, 2009, Sony Pictures released the film on standard-definition [[DVD]] as a part of their collection Film Noir Classics, Volume I with other early noir films ''[[The Big Heat]]'', ''[[The Lineup (film)|The Lineup]]'', ''[[Murder by Contract]]'', and ''[[The Sniper (1952 film)|The Sniper]]''.

'''African popular music''', like [[Music of Africa|African traditional music]], is vast and varied. Most contemporary genres of African popular music build on cross-pollination with western popular music. Many [[List of popular music genres|genres of popular music]] like [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[zouk]], and [[African Rumba|rumba]] derive to varying degrees on musical traditions from Africa, taken to the Americas by enslaved Africans. These rhythms and sounds have subsequently been adapted by newer genres like [[Rock music|rock]], and [[rhythm and blues]]. Likewise, African popular music has adopted elements, particularly the musical instruments and [[recording studio]] techniques of western music. The term "'''afropop'''" (also styled '''afro-pop''' or '''afro pop''') is sometimes used to refer to contemporary African pop music. The term does not refer to a specific style or sound,&lt;ref name="secouer"&gt;"[https://archive.is/20071021083103/http://www.bbc.co.uk/africabeyond/africaonyourstreet/glossary/ African on your street: Glossary (BBC)]". Archived from [http://www.bbc.co.uk/africabeyond/africaonyourstreet/glossary/ the original].&lt;/ref&gt; but is used as a general term for African popular music.

==Influence of Afro-Cuban music==
[[File:Orch baob 062608 001.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Orchestra Baobab]]
Cuban music has been popular in sub-Saharan Africa since the mid twentieth century. It was Cuban music that more than any other, that provided the initial template for Afropop. To the Africans, [[clave (rhythm)|clave]]-based Cuban popular music sounded both familiar and exotic.&lt;ref&gt;Nigerian musician Segun Bucknor: "Latin American music and our music is virtually the same"—quoted by Collins 1992 p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Africa v. 1''. states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Beginning in the 1940s, Afro-Cuban [son] groups such as Septeto Habanero and Trio Matamoros gained widespread popularity in the Congo region as a result of airplay over [[Radio Congo Belge]], a powerful radio station based in Léopoldville (now Kinshasa DRC). A proliferation of music clubs, recording studios, and concert appearances of Cuban bands in Léopoldville spurred on the Cuban music trend during the late 1940s and 1950s."&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Africa v. 1''. 2010 p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Congolese bands started doing Cuban covers and singing the lyrics phonetically. Soon, they were creating their own original Cuban-like compositions, with French lyrics. The Congolese called this new music ''rumba'', although it was really based on the son. The Africans adapted guajeos to electric guitars, and gave them their own regional flavor. The guitar-based music gradually spread out from the Congo, increasingly taking on local sensibilities. This process eventually resulted in the establishment of several different distinct regional genres, such as [[soukous]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, John Storm. ''Afro-Cuban Comes Home: The Birth and Growth of Congo Music''. Original Music cassette tape (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuban popular music played a major role in the development of many contemporary genres of African popular music. John Storm Roberts states: "It was the Cuban connection, but increasingly also New York [[salsa (music)|salsa]], that provided the major and enduring influences—the ones that went deeper than earlier imitation or passing fashion. The Cuban connection began very early and was to last at least twenty years, being gradually absorbed and re-Africanized."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts 1986. 20: 50. ''Afro-Cuban Comes Home: The Birth and Growth of Congo Music''.&lt;/ref&gt; The re-working of Afro-Cuban rhythmic patterns by Africans brings the rhythms full circle.

The re-working of the harmonic patterns reveals a striking difference in perception. The I IV V IV harmonic progression, so common in Cuban music, is heard in pop music all across the African continent, thanks to the influence of Cuban music. Those chords move in accordance with the basic tenets of Western music theory. However, as Gerhard Kubik points out, performers of African popular music do not necessarily perceive these progressions in the same way: "The harmonic cycle of C-F-G-F [I-IV-V-IV] prominent in Congo/Zaire popular music simply cannot be defined as a progression from tonic to subdominant to dominant and back to subdominant (on which it ends) because in the performer's appreciation they are of equal status, and not in any hierarchical order as in Western music."&lt;ref&gt;Kubik 1999 p. 105. ''Africa and the Blues''. Jackson, MI: University Press of Mississippi. {{ISBN|1-57806-145-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest wave of Cuban-based music to hit Africa was in the form of salsa. In 1974 the Fania All Stars performed in [[Zaire]] (known today as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]), Africa, at the 80,000-seat Stadu du Hai in Kinshasa. This was captured on film and released as ''Live In Africa'' (''Salsa Madness'' in the UK). The Zairean appearance occurred  at a music festival held in conjunction with the [[Muhammad Ali]]/[[George Foreman]] [[Rumble in the Jungle|heavyweight title fight]]. Local genres were already well established by this time. Even so, salsa caught on in many African countries, especially in the Senegambia and Mali. Cuban music had been the favorite of Senegal's nightspot in the 1950s to 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Stapleton 1990 116-117. ''African Rock: The Pop Music of a Continent''. New York: Dutton.&lt;/ref&gt; The Senegalese band [[Orchestra Baobab]] plays in a basic salsa style with congas and timbales, but with the addition of Wolof and Mandinka instruments and lyrics.

According to Lise Waxer: "African salsa points not so much to a return of salsa to African soil (Steward 1999: 157) but to a complex process of cultural appropriation between two regions of the so-called Third World."&lt;ref&gt;Waxer 2002 p. 12. ''Situating Salsa: Global Markets and Local Meanings in Latin Popular Music''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-8153-4020-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1990s African artists have also been very active through the super-group [[Africando]], where African and New York musicians mix with leading African singers such as Bambino Diabate, [[Ricardo Lemvo]], [[Ismael Lo]] and [[Salif Keita]]. It is still common today for an African artist to record a salsa tune, and add their own particular regional touch to it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8098">'''Alejandro "Alex" Omes''' (c. 1971 – January 12, 2015) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]]-born [[United States|American]] [[nightlife]] [[impresario]] and [[concert promoter]]. In 1999, Omes and [[Russell Faibisch]], his then-business partner, co-founded the [[Ultra Music Festival]], an outdoor [[electronic music|electronic]] [[music festival]] held annually in [[Miami, Florida]]. Since its founding, Ultra Music Festival has grown into one of the country's and the world's largest [[electronic dance music]] festivals.&lt;ref name=cos&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Ultra Music Festival co-founder Alex Omes found dead |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/01/ultra-music-festival-co-founder-alex-omes-found-dead/ |work=[[Consequence of Sound]] |date=2015-01-13 |accessdate=2015-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=miamiherald&gt;{{cite news|first=Howard|last=Cohen|title=Ultra co-founder, Miami nightlife fixture Alex Omes dies at 43 |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/obituaries/article6352869.html |work=[[Miami Herald]] |date=2015-01-20 |accessdate=2015-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 400,000 people attended Ultra Music Festival over the course of two weekends in 2013, the highest number of attendees to date.&lt;ref name=miamiherald/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Omes was born and raised in [[Argentina]].&lt;ref name=miamiherald/&gt; He moved to Miami Beach, [[Florida]], when he was 9 years old with his mother and brother, Carlos Omes.&lt;ref name=miamiherald/&gt; Alex Omes graduated from [[Miami Beach Senior High School]].&lt;ref name=miamiherald/&gt;&lt;ref name=mntimes&gt;{{cite news|first=Jose D.|last=Duran|title=How Russell Faibisch Built Ultra Music Festival -- and Whom He's Battled Along the Way |url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2013-03-14/music/how-russell-faibisch-built-ultra-music-festival-and-whom-he-s-battled-along-the-way/full/ |work=[[Miami New Times]] |date=2013-03-14 |accessdate=2015-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==
He began his career within Miami's club and electronic music scenes as a [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] at the Cameo [[nightclub]] in Miami Beach during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=mntimes/&gt; He then became a publisher of an electronic and dance music magazine called ''D'VOX'', which focused on Miami's emerging electronic dance music industry during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=mntimes/&gt; Omes acquired professional contacts within the city's music and DJ culture while working at ''D'VOX'' and the nightclubs.&lt;ref name=mntimes/&gt;

One of Omes's contacts within the music industry was Russell Faibisch, with whom he conceived the idea for a beachfront music festival that would become Ultra.&lt;ref name=mntimes/&gt; The two met at an event.  In a 2013 interview with Miami New Times, Faibisch recalled, "I was doing an event and had to place some ads...That's when I met Alex Omes, who had the vision. We started Ultra together."&lt;ref name=mntimes/&gt; Omes and Faibisch, who had similar interests in club music, soon became close friends and, later, business partners.&lt;ref name=mntimes/&gt; Together, they brainstormed the idea for a beachfront music festival to be held alongside the annual [[Winter Music Conference]] (WMC).&lt;ref name=mntimes/&gt; Thousands of attendees and electronic music fans had attended WMC annually since its creation in 1985.&lt;ref name=mntimes/&gt; The two business partners saw potential for a dance music event during the same week as WMC.&lt;ref name=mntimes/&gt; 

Faibisch and Omes organized the first Ultra Music Festival on March 13, 1999, in [[Collins Park]] in Miami Beach's [[South Beach]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name=mntimes/&gt; Artists performing at the first Ultra's main stage included [[Paul van Dyk]], [[DJ Baby Anne]] and [[Josh Wink]].&lt;ref name=mntimes/&gt; The 1999 Ultra festival proved popular, with 10,000 concertgoers in attendance, though Omes and Faibisch still saw a financial loss of between $10,000 and $20,000 on the project during its first year.&lt;ref name=mntimes/&gt; 

Ultra Music Festival was held as a one-day event from 1999 until 2006. It was expanded into a two-day festival from 2007 to 2010, eventually reaching across two consecutive weekends in 2013. Ultra Music Festival reverted to a three-day concert in 2014. The event has featured some of the world's top electronic and dance [[DJs]] and artists, including [[Avicii]], DJ Eddie G, [[Deadmau5]], [[Tiësto]], Paul van Dyk, and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].&lt;ref name=miamiherald/&gt;

Omes was pushed out of Ultra on August 10, 2010 after Ultra Music Festival officials ended its decade-long association with the Winter Music Conference.&lt;ref name=cos/&gt;&lt;ref name=mntimes/&gt; Omes charged that he had been forced out of Ultra following a "secret [[shareholders]]' meeting" in a lawsuit filed in 2012.&lt;ref name=mntimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=mntimes2&gt;{{cite news|first=S.|last=Pajot|title=Alex Omes: Memorial Service Announced for Ultra Cofounder |url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/crossfade/2015/01/alex-omes_memorial_service_ultra-music-festival_founder_miami_2015.php |work=[[Miami New Times]] |date=2014-01-20 |accessdate=2015-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alex Omes soon partnered with another Miami nightlife promoter, Emi Guerra. Together, Omes and Guerra co-founded Go Big Productions, an event company, to stage concerts and other major events in Miami.&lt;ref name=miamiherald/&gt; In 2011 and 2012, Go Big Productions held concerts featuring [[Swedish House Mafia]] on the same weekends as the Ultra Music Festival.&lt;ref name=cos/&gt;&lt;ref name=miamiherald/&gt; Go Big also planned a new two-day, multistage concert, called the UR1 music festival, which was scheduled to be held in [[downtown Miami]] in 2012, coinciding with [[Art Basel]].&lt;ref name=miamiherald/&gt; However, UR1, which would have featured [[Kanye West]] and [[Lou Reed]] as headliners, was cancelled due to lower than expected ticket sales.&lt;ref name=cos/&gt;&lt;ref name=miamiherald/&gt;

==Lawsuit and death==
In August 2012, Omes filed a $33 million lawsuit against Faibisch and two other Ultra Music Festival executives, Charlie Faibisch and Adam Russakoff, alleging that they had conspired to oust him from "the now financially successful event" (Ultra) following a "secret shareholders' meeting.&lt;ref name=cos/&gt;&lt;ref name=mntimes/&gt; The lawsuit alleged that the three knew that Omes would never agree to break off an existing affiliation with the Winter Music Conference.&lt;ref name=mntimes/&gt;

A two-week trial for the lawsuit began on Tuesday, January 13, 2015, in Miami.&lt;ref name=miamiherald/&gt; However, Alex Omes never arrived for that day's court proceedings.&lt;ref name=miamiherald/&gt; Omes's brother, Carlos, and his attorney, Aaron Resnick, became concerned when Omes didn't show up for the opening arguments on Tuesday morning.&lt;ref name=miamiherald/&gt; They discovered Alex Omes dead at his home at the age of 43.&lt;ref name=miamiherald/&gt; Omes had died on Monday night, January 12, 2015, according to a report from the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner.&lt;ref name=miamiherald/&gt;&lt;ref name=mntimes3&gt;{{cite news|first=Juan D.|last=Duran|title=Alex Omes, Ultra Cofounder and Miami Nightlife Icon, Has Died |url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/crossfade/2015/01/alex-omes_dead_ultra-music-festival_founder_miami_2015.php |work=[[Miami New Times]] |date=2014-01-13 |accessdate=2015-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; His cause of death was released by the medical examiner on March 9, 2016, saying that Omes had amphetamines, ketamine, cocaine and GHB in his system when he died and cocaine was found in his apartment. Omes was survived by his son, Joshua Omes, and former wife, Karie Omes.&lt;ref name=mntimes2/&gt; His funeral was held at [[St. Patrick Catholic Church (Miami Beach, Florida)|St. Patrick Catholic Church]] in Miami Beach on January 23, 2015.&lt;ref name=miamiherald/&gt;&lt;ref name=mntimes2/&gt;

'''Berikaoba''' ({{lang-ka|ბერიკაობა}}) is an improvised [[masquerade ceremony|masqueraded]] folk theatre in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], stemming from the [[paganism|pagan]] festivity of fertility and rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Burney, Charles Allen &amp; [[David Marshall Lang|Lang, David Marshall]] (1972), ''The Peoples of the Hills: Ancient Ararat and Caucasus'', p. 224. Praeger&lt;/ref&gt; The name is derived from a [[Common Kartvelian]] [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''ber'' (ბერ), meaning "a child". The scenes of Berikaoba range from those of explicitly [[eroticism|erotic]] nature to [[political satire]] and social protest.&lt;ref name="Georgia Today"&gt;Strelkova, Ruso.

Garland Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8240-6034-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Berikaoba typically involves several men, the berika, who are mostly disguised as animals. The costumes and masks for the [[mystery play|mystery]] are made of animal hide. Animal skulls, tails, feathers, horns, [[pumpkin]]s, ribbons and bells are used to add colorfulness to the scene. The festivity begins with a gathering of villagers who chose actors for the mystery. The procession of berikas – accompanied by sounds of [[bagpipes]] ([[gudastviri|stviri]]) – move door-to-door to pick wine, honey, floor, meat and other victuals served by hosts. The main characters in the procession are a "bride" called Kekela (კეკელა) and a groom who, after a series of attempts, persuades Kekela to marry her. The wedding is then disrupted by an appearance of a "[[Tatars|Tatar]]", a reference to the centuries of invasions from neighboring [[Muslim]] powers. The groom is killed and the people console Kekela, promising her a better husband. As berikas try to resuscitate the groom with help of healing water, herbs and minerals, the news spreads about the abduction of Kekela. This brings the groom back to life. He chases the kidnappers and relieves her bride. The performance finishes with a lengthy feast, ''[[Supra (feast)|supra]]''.&lt;ref name="Georgia Today"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abakelia, Nino (2008), [http://www.folklore.ee/Folklore/vol40/abakelia.pdf "The Spaciotemporal Patterns of Georgian Winter Solstice Festivals"].

The similar tradition, ''keenoba'' (ყეენობა, from "the [[Khan (title)|Khan]]"), satirizing the foreign invaders of Georgia and later the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] officialdom, enjoyed particular popularity in the 19th-century [[Tbilisi]] and its environs.&lt;ref name="Suny"&gt;[[Ronald Grigor Suny|Suny, Ronald Grigor]] (1994), ''The Making of the Georgian Nation'', p. 90.

The '''Big Apple Comic Con''' is a [[New York City]] [[comic book]] convention, the longest-running comic book/[[speculative fiction]]/pop culture convention in New York City. It was started by retailer Michael "Mike Carbo" Carbonaro in March [[1996 in comics|1996]] in the basement of the [[St. Paul the Apostle Church (Manhattan)|St. Paul the Apostle Church]]. A location that a competing show promotor Sunrise Productions Scooty O'Donnell and Partner Richard Ritz Whom Held The New York Horror-Fi Con there on October 4, 1997.  During its heyday from 2001–2008, the Big Apple Comic Con often featured multiple shows per year, with a large three-day "national" convention held in November, usually held at the Penn Plaza Pavilion. The show was owned by [[Wizard Entertainment]] from 2009 to 2013, but is now back in the hands of Carbonaro.

Over the course of its history, the convention has been known as the '''Big Apple Convention''', the '''Big Apple Comic Book Art, and Toy Show''', and the '''Big Apple Comic Book, Art, Toy &amp; Sci-Fi Expo'''; with the November shows known as the '''National Comic Book, Art, Toy, and Sci-Fi Expo''', the '''National Comic Book, Art, and Sci-Fi Expo''', and the '''National Comic Book, Comic Art, and Fantasy Convention'''. In 2014, the name "Big Apple Convention" was revived by Carbonaro for a show scheduled for March 7, 2015. The Big Apple Comic Convention has continued yearly since then, the latest show April 14-15, 2018.

Though it primarily focuses on comic books, the convention features a large range of [[popular culture|pop culture]] elements, such as books, cinema, [[science fiction]]/fantasy, television, animation, [[anime]], [[manga]], toys, [[horror fiction|horror]], [[collectible card game]]s, video games, [[webcomics]], and [[fantasy]] novels. Along with panels, seminars, and workshops with comic book professionals, the Big Apple Comic Con often features previews of upcoming films, and such evening events as the costume contest overseen by "Captain Zorikh" [[Zorikh Lequidre]]. 

The convention regularly hosts hundreds of artists, exhibitors and film and television personalities in a huge floorspace for exhibitors. The show includes an autograph and photo op opportunities with all of the guests, as well as the Artists' Alley where comics artists can sign autographs and sell or do free sketches.

In 2009, Michael Carbonaro established his own independent one-day convention known as the '''New York Comic Book Marketplace''' which ran annually through 2014.&lt;ref name=Pate /&gt;

== History ==

=== Antecedents ===
Major comic book conventions in New York City prior to the Big Apple Comic Con included [[Dave Kaler]]'s [[Academy Con]], which ran annually from 1965–1967; [[Phil Seuling]]'s [[Comic Art Convention]], which ran annually from 1968–1983 (Seuling died in 1984); and the large annual [[Creation Convention|Creation]] conventions, usually taking place over the weekend following [[Thanksgiving]] from 1971–1987. (Creation sometimes put on as many as a half-dozen smaller New York City shows per year).&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;Grant, Steven. [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=14149 "Permanent Damage: Issue #43,"] ''Comic Book Resources'' (July 10, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; From 1993-1995, promoter Frederic Greenberg&lt;ref&gt;Butash, Titian. "Human conflicts make superheroes appeal to fans of all ages," ''Austin American Statesman'' (01 Jan 1989), p. E11.&lt;/ref&gt; began hosting [[Great Eastern Conventions]] shows annually at venues including the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]]. (Great Eastern also ran shows in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts.) Other companies, including Dynamic Forces, held New York City conventions, but all were on a smaller scale than the Seuling shows. Changes in the industry, popular culture, and the resurgent city itself since the troubled 1960s and '70s made large-scale comic-book conventions difficult to hold profitably. Jonah Weiland of ComicBookResources.com also noted that "... dealing with the various convention unions made it difficult for most groups to get a show off the ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Weiland|first=Jonah|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=5400|title=Battling Conventions?

=== Birth of the show ===
[[File:10.17.09TomNoonanByLuigiNovi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tom Noonan]] at the Big Apple Comic Con, October 17, 2009]]
On February 29, 1996, Greenberg cancelled what had been advertised as a larger-than-usual Great Eastern show, scheduled for March 2–3 at the [[New York Coliseum]], which the fan press had suggested&lt;ref name=Newswatch&gt;"Newswatch: NYC Comics Convention Cancelled, Fans Irate," ''The Comics Journal'' #185 (Mar. 1996), pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; might herald a successor to the [[Comic Art Convention]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} As a substitute event, comic book retailers Carbonaro and Vincent Zurzuolo on the spur of the moment mounted the first Big Apple Convention (dubbed "[[Hallelujah]] Con" or "The Show Must Go On"&lt;ref&gt;Miller, John Jackson. [http://www.cbgxtra.com/cbgs-1996-order-estimates-for-diamond-comic-distributors-and-heroes-world-distribution "Capital Sale Tops Turbulent Year: The Top 10 Comics News Stories of 1996,"] ''Comics Buyer's Guide'' #1210 (Jan. 24, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Con) in the basement of the [[Church of St. Paul the Apostle (New York City)|Church of St. Paul the Apostle]].&lt;ref name=Pate&gt;Pate, Brian [http://www.conventionscene.com/2012/03/30/mike-carbonaro-retiring-from-convention-promoting-with-final-2012-nycbm-show/#u8E2y4liHsA2mPPg.99 "Mike Carbonaro Retiring From Convention Promoting with Final 2012 NYCBM Show,"] Convention Scene (Mar. 30, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Their show attracted over 4,000 attendees, most of whom had been planning to attend the scheduled Great Eastern Show.&lt;ref name=Newswatch /&gt;

After the success of the initial 1996 show, Big Apple scheduled six separate conventions for 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Six Big Apple Cons Set for '97," ''Comics Buyer's Guide'' (Jan. 31, 1997), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Big Apple held two conventions, a two-day September show and a one-day affair in October. In 1999 there was a March show and the three-day "National" show held in November;&lt;ref&gt;Frankenhoff, Brent. "Big Apple Blossoms into National Comic Book, Comic Art, and Toy Show," ''Comics Buyer's Guide'' (Oct. 22, 1999), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; 2000 followed the same pattern. (The National show had by this time moved to the Metropolitan Pavilion; other shows continued to be held at St. Paul's Church.) Over the years, these small shows attracted many comics creators and pop-culture figures, and by 2000 the convention had moved to the Metropolitan Pavilion on West 18th Street in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000930040024/http://www.bigapplecon.com/unflash.html |title=Big Apple Comic Book, Art &amp; Toy Show|date=November 10–12, 2000| archivedate=September 30, 2000|publisher=BigAppleCon.com|url=http://www.bigapplecon.com/unflash.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2001 was a big year for Big Apple, with five conventions spread throughout the year. In 2002 four shows were held, and in 2003 Big Apple put on six separate conventions. In 2003, "Captain Zorikh" Lequidre began running the costume contest, which became well known for its audience-participation judging.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} 

By 2004 (which saw four separate shows), the convention had moved to the Penn Plaza Pavilion at the [[Hotel Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013082323/http://www.bigapplecon.com/ |title=The National Comic Book, Art &amp; Sci-Fi Expo|date=November 19–21, 2004|archivedate=October 13, 2004|publisher=BigAppleCon.com|url=http://www.bigapplecon.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509134048/http://www.bigapplecon.com/ |title=Big Apple Comic Book, Art, Toy &amp; Sci-Fi Expo|date=June 7–8, 2008|archivedate=May 9, 2008|publisher=BigAppleCon.com|url=http://www.bigapplecon.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930100426/http://www.bigapplecon.com/ |title=Big Apple Comic Book, Art, Toy &amp; Sci-Fi Expo|date=November 14–16, 2008|archivedate=September 30, 2008|publisher=BigAppleCon.com|url=http://www.bigapplecon.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, show organizers claimed to have attracted over 30,000 attendees throughout the year.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In 2005, Big Apple put on five shows, repeating that pattern in 2006. (From 2006–2009, the June shows were given the moniker "Summer Sizzler.") 2007 saw three shows; Captain Zorikh, who had previously been managing Internet promotions and other aspects of the convention (including the costume contest), was named general manager of the convention; he acted in this role through the 2008 shows.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} 

By 2008, the frequency of Big Apple Conventions was slowing down, with just two shows, a Summer Sizzler and the usual three-day November National convention. The last show before Wizard's purchase of Big Apple was a June Summer Sizzler; 2009 was also the final year there were multiple Big Apple Conventions held. 

=== Acquisition by Wizard Entertainment ===
[[File:Alien abduction (4020916585).jpg|thumb|Big Apple Comic Con, October 17, 2009]]
In 2009, the Big Apple Comic Con was purchased by [[Wizard Entertainment]]; Michael Carbonaro was retained as a senior adviser. The first show under Wizard was held October 2009 at Pier 94 in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;[[1010 WINS]]. New York. October 16, 2009, broadcast.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wizardworld.com/guests-apple.html Guest page for the October 2009 Big Apple Convention at Wizard World] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511091956/http://www.wizardworld.com/guests-apple.html |date=May 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point the new manager, [[Spat Oktan]], who had hosted costume contests at other conventions, took over the costume contest and Captain Zorikh was put in charge of the children's costume contest, while continuing in other capacities.

By 2011, [[Reed Exhibitions]]' [[New York Comic Con]], held annually at the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]], had become the dominant New York City-area comic convention, and was taking away from the appeal of the Big Apple Comic Con.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Wizard sat out 2012 and held a new "Wizard World New York City Experience" show on June 28–30, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wizardworld.com/home-nyc.html Wizard World New York City Experience show page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213120621/http://www.wizardworld.com/home-nyc.html |date=2013-02-13 }}. Accessed February 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New York Comic Book Marketplace ===
Though not branded as a "Big Apple Convention" and not affiliated with Wizard World, some might consider the next iteration of the Big Apple Comic Con to have been held on March 31, 2012, at the Penn Plaza Pavilion. It was Michael Carbonaro's third '''New York Comic Book Marketplace''', and announced as Carbonaro's final convention.&lt;ref name=Pate /&gt;&lt;ref name="Calmixx"&gt;Calmixx (March 28, 2012). [http://geekpropaganda.net/?p=5147 "Another Comic Book Era Comes to a Close..."]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. GeekPropaganda.&lt;/ref&gt; The guest of honor was [[Stan Lee]]; other guests included [[George Pérez]], [[Joe Sinnott]], [[Dick Ayers]], [[Carmine Infantino]], [[Jim Steranko]], [[Irwin Hasen]], [[Mike Royer (comics)|Mike Royer]], [[Arthur Suydam]], [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]], [[Rich Buckler]], and [[Johnny Brennan]], and Captain Zorikh's costume contest&lt;ref&gt;Romano, Lauren (March 27, 2012). [https://news.yahoo.com/stan-lee-york-comic-book-marketplace-come-nyc-224800747.html "Stan Lee and the New York Comic Book Marketplace Come to NYC"]. [[Yahoo! News]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Carbonaro held another NYCBM at the Hotel Pennsylvania on April 13, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycbm.com "Mike Carbo's NYCBM"]. [[LiveJournal]]. Retrieved March 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 NYCBM was held at the [[Hotel New Yorker]] on March 1, and featured extensive [[zombie]] programming, including the premier screening of ''Zombie Hunters: City of the Dead'' Episode 10.

== Revival ==
Michael Carbonaro regained the Big Apple Comic Con brand in 2014 and held the "20th Anniversary Return of the Big Apple Convention" on March 7, 2015, moving the show to a larger and more accessible space [[Pennsylvania Plaza|Penn Plaza Pavilion]]. He completely revamped and expanded the show with new management and a commitment to creating a non-corporate comic book convention that reflects the diversity and interests of the New York Community. 

== Criticism ==
Comics creator [[Evan Dorkin]] was a critic of the Big Apple Con. He singled out the November 2008 show in particular as "the worst convention I've ever had the displeasure to sit through", for the lackluster celebrity guests, the lack of floor plan guides for attendees, inconsistently-functioning restrooms, elevator and escalators, the poorly performing volunteer staff, and an overall seedy, [[flea market]] atmosphere of rude dealers, creators inattentive to fans, and attendees who were disproportionately male. Dorkin, who vowed never to return to the venue, also singled out the cramped space of the venue, in particular Artist's Alley, which he speculated may have constituted a [[fire hazard]].&lt;ref name=Dorkin&gt;Dorkin, Evan (November 16, 2008). [http://evandorkin.livejournal.com/176123.html "National Tragedy"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712002747/http://evandorkin.livejournal.com/176123.html |date=2015-07-12 }}.

'''Comité de libération du cinéma français''' was an organization of [[filmmaker]]s in [[France]] created in 1943. The most well-known members are [[Jacques Becker]], [[Pierre Blanchar]], [[Louis Daquin]], [[Jean Painlevé]], and [[Jean-Paul Le Chanois]]. Members of this organization made projects for [[French cinema]] for after the War. During the [[German occupation of France in World War II]] they made films about the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]], such as one showing a Maquis camp in [[Vercors Plateau|Vercors]]. During the uprising in [[Paris]] they filmed the documentary ''Journal de la résistance : la Libération de Paris'' (directed by [[André Zwobada]]). Parts of this movie were used in the newsreel ''France Libre Actualités''.

The group also created its own underground film journal called [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27%C3%89cran_fran%C3%A7ais L’Ecran français] in 1943. After the war, the publication became a place where film critics could debate each other, such as the iconic argument over [[Citizen Kane]] between [[Andre Bazin]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. The publication ended in 1953.

The same stories are included in the ''[[Moksopaya]]'', on which the ''Yoga Vasistha'' was based, as well.

In the beginning of the book Vasistha states that the stories have a "definite purpose and a limited intention.

'''''Diablo Immortal''''' is an upcoming [[action role-playing]] [[hack and slash]] video game in the [[Diablo (series)|''Diablo'' series]] designed for [[massively multiplayer online|online multiplayer]] play on mobile devices. Developed by [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard]] and [[NetEase]], the game was announced in late 2018 and is planned for release on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] with no set release date.

== Gameplay ==

''Diablo Immortal'' is a [[massively multiplayer online]] [[action game]] in the [[Diablo (series)|''Diablo'' series]] designed for play on mobile devices.{{r|Verge: full-fledged}}&lt;!-- hack n slash goes here --&gt; The fast-paced{{r|Polygon: not for me}} ''Immortal'' is set between the events of ''Diablo 2'' and ''Diablo 3'',{{r|Polygon: reskin}} and borrows the look and feel of the latter.{{r|Polygon: not for me}} 

The game is designed for a touchscreen, with virtual controls that overlay the display: a directional thumbstick and ability buttons. The player can aim the ability by holding its button.{{r|Polygon: not for me}} Each of the six character classes—Barbarian, Wizard, Monk, Necromancer, Demon Hunter, and Crusader{{r|Polygon: reskin}}—have four abilities,{{r|Kotaku: preview}} which differ across character classes. For example, the Barbarian's class abilities include a slamming hammer and turning into a whirlwind. The Wizard casts a beam of electricity that boomerangs back to its source, dealing damage twice.{{r|Polygon: not for me}} Skills generally aim towards the nearest enemy.{{r|Kotaku: preview}} Blizzard plans for each class to have 12 unlockable skills, from which the player choose five to use concurrently.{{r|Kotaku: preview}}

Defeated enemies drop items ("loot") that can be equipped via a pop-up button.{{r|Kotaku: preview}} Players can join and leave groups that play through "dynamic events".{{r|Verge: full-fledged}} Unlike other ''Diablo'' series games, in the ''Immortal'' preview, the mana resource is removed and newly equipped items do not change the visual appearance of the player's character.{{r|Kotaku: preview}}

== Development ==

''Immortal'' is co-developed by Blizzard and NetEase.{{r|Verge: full-fledged}} The latter developer had been Blizzard's partner for Chinese market releases.{{r|Polygon: reskin}} Blizzard intended to bring the core ''Diablo'' experience to the smartphone platform. As a result, its interfaces reflect choices that would make that experience best fit the medium.{{r|Polygon: response}} By designing for a smartphone gaming audience, ''Immortal'' was designed to reach demographics and geographic regions that use mobile phones as their main gaming platform and may not otherwise interact with ''Diablo'' on other gaming platforms.{{r|Polygon: response}}

The game is planned for release on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] platforms.{{r|Polygon: reskin}} No release date is set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Welsh |first1=Oli |title=There's an all-new Diablo game called Diablo Immortal |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=2018-11-02 |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-02-theres-an-all-new-diablo-game-called-diablo-immortal |language=en |accessdate=2018-11-04 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Players can pre-register on the game's website for admission to [[playtest]] the [[beta release|beta]].{{r|Verge: full-fledged}} Blizzard also announced plans to keep the ''Immortal'' experience fresh after its initial release with the regular addition of stories and characters.{{r|Verge: full-fledged}} The game was announced at the opening ceremony of BlizzCon in November 2018.

==Reception==
====Pre-release====
The announcement's response was largely negative.{{r|Polygon: response}} While traditional gaming audiences often express skepticism towards diluted mobile versions of a cherished franchise, the ''Diablo'' series community's discontent was compounded by their anticipation for a larger announcement.{{r|Polygon: reskin|Polygon: response}} They expressed their discontent through online channels, likening ''Immortal'' to a reskin of one of NetEase's prior games, ''Crusaders of Light''.{{r|Polygon: reskin}} Blizzard responded that ''Immortal'' is but one ''Diablo'' series game in active development, and pointed to the company's multi-platform development experience and the success of the mobile version of ''[[Hearthstone (video game)|Hearthstone]]''  as evidence of Blizzard's capacity to overcome uncertainty and do right by their core audience.{{r|Polygon: response}} Blizzard also debunked a rumor that they had withheld announcement of a main ''Diablo'' sequel due to the negative response at ''Immortal''{{'}}s reveal; Blizzard stated "we didn’t pull any announcements from BlizzCon this year or have plans for other announcements. We do continue to have different teams working on multiple unannounced Diablo projects, and we look forward to announcing when the time is right."{{r|IGN: withholding}}.

After the reveal at [[BlizzCon]], developers participated in a Q&amp;A with attendees. Two particular questions leveled at Wyatt Cheng, Principal Game Designer at Blizzard, drew significant attention from media and audiences alike, with one attendee asking if the announcement was an "out of season [[April Fools']] joke"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph Knoop|url=https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/diablo-immortal/|title=‘Is this an April Fools joke?’ Blizzard fans are having a fit over the new Diablo mobile game|publisher=The Daily Dot|date=November 3, 2018|accessdate=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eli Becht|title=WATCH: Fan Asks If Diablo: Immortal Is April Fool's Joke

Previews of the game's demo approved of the game's controls,{{r|Polygon: not for me|Kotaku: preview}} its interface having been tested by prior NetEase games,{{r|Kotaku: preview}} &lt;!--While ''Kotaku'' described the controls as intuitive and occasionally slow,{{r|Kotaku: preview}}--&gt;though ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''{{'s}} reviewer noted difficulties in precision controls.&lt;!--with ranged classes?--&gt;{{r|Polygon: not for me}} The locked abilities made some character classes less enjoyable to play, as the Wizard's ability cooldown timers made the class less effective in groups.{{r|Kotaku: preview}}

Demo reviewers felt that where ''Immortal'' captured the series' look and feel, it omitted some of its core tenets,{{r|Polygon: not for me|Kotaku: preview}} or as ''Polygon'' put it, ''Diablo''{{'s}} "soul".{{r|Polygon: not for me}} Whereas the mobile game captured the basic Diablo experience, the reviewers questioned whether the new entry had enough new content to remain fresh.{{r|Polygon: not for me|Kotaku: preview}}&lt;!-- enough to warrant the transition to imprecise hardware.{{r|Polygon: not for me}}--&gt;&lt;!--Journalists noted similarities between the game's user interface and that of free-to-play mobile game ''Crusaders of Light'' (2017) by [[NetEase]]. The developer collaborates with Blizzard to release the latter's games in China.{{r|Polygon: reskin}}--&gt;

'''Don Maclean''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] [[Order of St. Sylvester|KSS]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-18220967 Comedian Don Maclean made Papal Knight], bbc.co.uk; accessed 27 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[England|English]] [[actor]] and [[comedian]], who appeared on the [[BBC]] [[television series]] ''[[Crackerjack (TV series)|Crackerjack]]'' with [[Michael Aspel]], [[Peter Glaze]] and [[Jan Hunt]] in the 1970s.

Born in [[Birmingham]], he attended Clifton Road School, [[Balsall Heath]] and [[St. Philip's School]], which was a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[grammar school]] for boys in [[Edgbaston]]. His first job was as a [[civil servant]] at the [[Inland Revenue]] and he was an entertainer in pubs, clubs and holiday camps. Maclean's first television appearance was on the soap opera ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' and early in his career he was a comedy compère of the [[BBC]] Television Series ''[[The Black and White Minstrel Show]]''.

On Crackerjack Maclean usually performed a live routine or routines with Glaze in front of a studio audience of children and a filmed insert with Glaze, in the style of a silent comedy film. Live routines would almost always work in the 'joke' where an exasperated Glaze would exclaim 'Maclean!' to which Maclean would answer 'Yes, I had a bath this morning!'. Also notable was that when responding to Glaze's exasperation, Maclean would regularly give an alliterative reply, such as "Don't get your knickers in a knot" or "Don't get your tights in a twist".

Maclean also appeared in the film ''[[Carry On Columbus]]''. A practising Roman Catholic, from 1990 Maclean presented [[BBC Radio 2]]'s religious show ''Good  Morning Sunday'', until he was replaced by [[Aled Jones]] in 2006.

He hosted the panel games ''The Clever Dick-Athlon'' (1988–90) and ''Are You Sitting Comfortably'' (1993–96), both for Radio 2, and ''[[First Letter First]]'' (1993) for BBC1. He also toured in the play ''There's No Place Like a Home'' with [[Gorden Kaye]]. In 2009, he claimed that the BBC is keen on programmes which attack churches and that there is a wider secularist campaign to get rid of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christian.org.uk/news/20090623/bbc-is-anti-christian-and-pro-muslim-says-ex-host "BBC is anti-Christian and pro-Muslim says ex host"], christian.org.uk; accessed 21 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Mclean pleaded guilty to [[drink-driving]] and had his licence suspended for twelve months.&lt;ref name=BhamMail /&gt;

'''Ducks Unlimited''' (DU) is an American [[nonprofit organization]] [[501(c)]] dedicated to the [[conservation movement|conservation]] of [[wetlands]] and associated upland habitats for waterfowl, other wildlife, and people. It has maintained a worldwide membership of about 700,000 since January 2013.&lt;ref name=DU-factsheet&gt;{{cite web|title=National Fact Sheet| url= http://www.ducks.org/media/_global/_documents/stateFactSheets/NationalFactSheet.pdf| website= Ducks.org| publisher= Ducks Unlimited| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130328112035/http://www.ducks.org/media/_global/_documents/stateFactSheets/NationalFactSheet.pdf| archivedate= March 28, 2013| accessdate= January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DU-factsheet2016&gt;{{cite web |title= National Fact Sheet| url= http://www.ducks.org/media/_global/_documents/stateFactSheets/NationalFactSheet.pdf| website= Ducks.org| publisher= Ducks Unlimited| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160222050835/http://www.ducks.org/media/_global/_documents/stateFactSheets/NationalFactSheet.pdf| archivedate= February 22, 2016 | accessdate= January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and profile==
In 1927, an offshoot of the Boone and Crockett Club was created specifically for sport bird management and operated until 1930 as the American Wild Fowlers. Membership included such people as Arthur Bartley and [[Nash Buckingham]], who would later be very instrumental in the conservation movement. In 1930, [[Joseph P. Knapp]], a publishing tycoon who successfully obtained such notable publications as ''The Associated Sunday Magazine'', Crowell Publishing Company, ''Collier’s Weekly'', ''Farm and Fireside'' and the book publisher P.F. Collier &amp; Sons, founded More Game Birds in America and American Wild Fowlers was quickly absorbed into the new organization.

In 1937, Knapp, Robert Winthrop, and a small group of conservation philanthropists decided to focus on the decreasing waterfowl populations, and the habitat necessary to sustain them in Canada, and formed Ducks Unlimited Inc. As had happened before, More Game Birds in America was absorbed by the new waterfowl organization.&lt;ref name= honored&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.boone-crockett.org/news/featured_story.asp?area=news&amp;ID=132 | publisher= Boone and Crockett Club| title= Ducks Unlimited Honored by B&amp;C Club| date= March 21, 2012| website= boone-crockett.org| access-date= January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Bolen| first = Eric| title = Waterfowl Management: Yesterday and Tomorrow| journal =The Journal of Wildlife Management| volume = 64| issue = 2| pages = 323–335|date=April 2000| doi = 10.2307/3803230| jstor =3803230 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Fowlers 1927"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://cdm103401.cdmhost.com/cdm/singleitem/collection/p16013coll13/id/949/rec/1 | title= A Proposed Plan of Activities for The Wild Fowlers of North America| year= 1927| publisher= The Wild Fowlers of North America, Boone and Crockett Club Archives, Montana Memory Project| access-date= January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ducks Unlimited Canada was incorporated in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada, on March 10, 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal =Ducks Unlimited| volume = 76| issue = 1| page =10|title=Ducks Unlimited|date=January–February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ducks Unlimited also works in Mexico through their sister organization, Ducks Unlimited de Mexico.

DU has conserved at least 12.5 million acres&lt;ref name= DUH&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ducks.org/Hunting/Ducks-Unlimited-and-Hunting| title= Ducks Unlimited and Hunting |website= Ducks.org| publisher= Ducks Unlimited| access-date= January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; — perhaps more than 13.8 million acres — of waterfowl habitat in [[North America]].&lt;ref name=PhilMag&gt;{{cite news |last= Jones|first=Lindsay|title=Ducks in a Row| url= http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/excellence_in_philanthropy/ducks_in_a_row |accessdate=8 January 2013| work= Philanthropy| date= Fall 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; DU partners with a wide range of corporations, governments, other [[non-governmental organization]]s, landowners, and private citizens to restore and manage areas that have been degraded and to prevent further degradation of existing wetlands. DU is also active in working with others to recommend government policies that will positively influence wetlands and the environment.&lt;ref name= gpolicies&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ducks.org/conservation/public-policy | website= Ducks.org| publisher= Ducks Unlimited| title= Public Policy| access-date= January 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; DU generated more than $235 million in revenues during their 2012 fiscal year,&lt;ref name=PhilMag /&gt; of which a minimum of 80 percent&lt;ref name= DUH /&gt; goes directly toward habitat conservation.&lt;ref name=DU-factsheet /&gt; Their sources of revenue include federal and state habitat reimbursements, conservation easements, sponsors and members, major gifts and donations and royalties/advertisement. Through its conservation activities, DU benefits biodiversity, water quality, the environment and the economy in the areas in which it is active. The Ducks Unlimited logo was commissioned and then created by Winnipeg artist Ernie Wilson.

January 29, 2017, marked Ducks Unlimited’s 80th anniversary. ConocoPhillips, a multinational energy corporation headquartered in Houston, received the inaugural Ducks Unlimited Corporate Conservation Achievement Award at DU’s 80th annual convention in San Antonio, celebrating the organizations 80th anniversary. 

In keeping with Ducks Unlimited's founders' intentions, the organization promotes the continuation of safe and regulated waterfowl hunting. The majority of DU's financial contributors and 90 percent of members are hunters.&lt;ref name= DUH /&gt; Its [http://www.ducks.org/news-media/ducks-unlimited-magazine ''DU Magazine''] contains many historical and practical articles on waterfowl hunting, and it obtains revenue from advertisements of waterfowling equipment such as shotguns, ammunition, decoys, and bird calls.

=== 2017 Annual Report ===
According to Ducks Unlimited 2017 Annual Report, 2017 marked the seventh consecutive year that the budget goals were surpassed, with total revenues approaching $224 million. Over 58,000 DU volunteers organized 4,050 events which attracted over 577,000 attendees. The $86 million of philanthropic revenue generated in 2017 surpassed that which was raised in 2016 by over $1.8 million from contributions by 5,000 donors and 700,000 members.

Ducks Unlimited included a list of new goals for 2018 in their annual report. In the upcoming year, the organization intends to:

* Dedicate at least 80 cents of each dollar to conservation
* Complete the ongoing Rescue Our Wetlands campaign by raising $2 billion by December 2018
* Continue support for the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA) as well as the conservation provisions in the upcoming Farm Bill

==Conservation==
Traditionally, most DU wetland conservation projects were conducted on waterfowl breeding areas in the Canadian prairies by its sister organization, Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC). DUC has however expanded its operations to include projects in every Canadian province and territory, not just in the prairies. DU has also expanded its operations to include conservation projects in every state of the United States and in Mexico. It retains primary focus on [http://www.ducks.org/conservation/where-we-work habitats most important to waterfowl]; including the restoration of duck breeding habitat in Canada and the northern central states, and also duck overwintering habitat, mostly in the coastal and southern states and in Mexico.

=== Methods ===

Ducks Unlimited places strong emphasis on science and research. It works closely with biologists and ecologists to evaluate habitat needs and to monitor how birds respond to various environmental changes. Some of the methods used by Ducks Unlimited to conserve habitats are:&lt;ref name="DU-how we work"&gt;{{cite web|title=How DU Conserves Wetlands and Waterfowl|url=http://www.ducks.org/conservation/how-du-conserves-wetlands-and-waterfowl|publisher=Ducks Unlimited|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Restoring grassland: Grassland cover helps hens conceal their nests and increases their chances of successfully hatching a clutch, as well as increases sexual productivity and heightens the chance of producing offspring.
;Replanting forests: Forests that flood regularly due to overflowing riverbanks, such as the bottomland hardwood forests in the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain|Mississippi Alluvial Valley]] make for ideal wintering habitat for ducks, and provide essential breeding and foraging habitat for other wildlife species. However, 80% of these forests have been cleared and natural flooding has been reduced by 50–90%.
;Restoring watersheds: When watersheds are disturbed, contaminants wash into wetlands and disrupt the plants, fish and animals. DU restores drained wetlands, protects stream corridors and establishes buffer strips that filter nutrients and silt.
;Educating landowners: DU works with farmers, ranchers and other landowners to improve the agricultural and recreational value of their land while making it more wildlife-friendly.
;Conservation easements: Conservation easements protect the natural resource values of a property in perpetuity. The landowner maintains actual ownership of the land, but agrees to certain development restrictions.  Since 75% of U.S. wetlands are on private property, conservation easements play a crucial role in the conservation movement.
;Acquiring land: The direct purchase of wetlands to restore and protect it. Once restoration is complete, DU generally sells or donates the property to a group or agency that will manage it for wildlife.

Ducks Unlimited also works closely with government leaders, conservation leaders, private landowners and farmers to ensure that environmental provisions are contained in the Farm Bill. The Farm Bill supports programs such as the [[Conservation Reserve Program]] (CRP) and [[Wetlands Reserve Program]] (WRP).

=== Regions of special interest ===

[[Image:Barringer-Arial.jpg|thumb|[[Barringer Slough]] in [[Geology of Iowa|Iowa]], a remnant of the extensive prairie wetlands that once covered the region.]]

Ducks Unlimited takes a continental, landscape approach to wetland conservation. While DU works in all 50 states, the organization focuses its efforts and resources on the habitats most beneficial to waterfowl and in greatest jeopardy of disappearing. The following areas are considered to be DU's top 5 conservation priorities:&lt;ref name=DU-factsheet /&gt;

'''ESL Pro League Season 4''' (shortened as '''EPL Season 4''') was a [[Counter-Strike: Global Offensive]] tournament run by [[ESL (eSports)|ESL]]. It was the fourth season of the [[ESL Pro League]], and had an overall prize pool of $750,000 . For the first time, the Finals took place in South America – [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], from October 28 to October 30.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.pro.eslgaming.com/csgo/proleague/news/the-us-750k-esl-csgo-pro-league-season-4-finals-are-coming-to-brazil/&lt;/ref&gt; Teams from two continents, North America and Europe competed in fourteen team leagues to attempt to qualify for the Finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.pro.eslgaming.com/csgo/proleague/matches/|title=ESL CS:GO Pro League|last=ESL|website=en.pro.eslgaming.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe's season began with [[FaZe Clan]] defeating Team X (which later formed into Heroic) and ended with [[Team Dignitas]] defeating Virtus.pro in a best of three 6th place decider. North America's season started with [[Cloud9]] defeating [[Team Liquid]] and ended with [[Immortals (eSports)|Immortals]] defeating [[Echo Fox]]. In the finals, [[Cloud9 (eSports)|Cloud9]] defeated [[SK Gaming]] 2-1 to become the ESL Pro League Season 4 Champions and take home $200,000 prize money; this upset would also mark the first time a North American won an international premier event since iBUYPOWER won ESEA Season 16 - Global Invite Division in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.pro.eslgaming.com/csgo/proleague/finals/tournament/playoffs/#?matchday=1|title=ESL CS:GO Pro League|last=ESL|website=en.pro.eslgaming.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The format was slightly different to the previous renditions of the tournament.

Each continent featured the top 11 teams from ESL Pro League Season 3, one team from the ESEA Season 21: Premier Division Qualifier, one team from the ESL Pro League Season 3 Relegation, and one team from the Wild Card Qualifier. Teams within each continent played each other twice to determine the top four qualifiers to the Finals in Brazil. There was be a total of nine weeks in this phase of the tournament. All games were played online.

Teams that placed seventh to eleventh are automatically invited to next season's ESL Pro League. 12th and 13th place are invited to Season 4's Relegation and 14th place will be placed in the ESEA Premier Season 24.

The Finals consisted of twelve teams, six from Europe and six from North America. These teams were separated into two groups. The group stage consisted of every team in each group playing against each other. The top three teams in each group moved on to the Playoffs. The knockout stages were a best of three format. All games in the Finals were played offline. The top team in each group received a bye and automatically moved onto the Semifinals. The other four teams played in the Round of Six. The winners of those two games moved on to the Semifinals, and the winner of the Semifinals moved onto the Finals.

===Standings===
The final standings are shown below. Each team's in-game leader is shown first. The rosters shown reflect the rosters as they were by the end of the season. For instance, Timothée "DEVIL" Démolon was replaced with Christophe "SIXER" Xia on Team EnVyUS midway through the season. Therefore, SIXER's name is shown instead of DEVIL's.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;Finn "karrigan" Andersen was on the Astralis until the end of the regular season. However, FaZe Clan acquired the Danish in-game leader before the São Paolo Finals. Since Astralis did not qualify for the Finals and FaZe did, karrigan's name is shown in both Astralis's and FaZe's rosters.&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;Team EnVyUs was forced to forfeit its first map to Virtus.pro as two of its players could not log on to their accounts. The second map was played as normal.&lt;/small&gt;

'''[[Justice]]''' in [[economics]] is a subcategory of [[welfare economics]] with models frequently [[Mathematical problem|representing]] the ethical-social [[social choice|requirements]] of a given theory,&lt;ref&gt;• Developed along more general lines in [[Allan Gibbard]], 1990, ''Wise Choices, Apt Feelings''. [http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198249856.do#.UPWifx1LWSo Description] and chapter-preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=qiDaZ-evhUQC&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false links.]&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Marc Fleurbaey, 2008.  "ethics and economics," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition.  [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000272&amp;edition=current&amp;q Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; whether "in the large", as of a just [[social order]],&lt;ref&gt;For example, in Barry Clark and [[Herbert Gintis]], 1978, "Rawlsian Justice and Economic Systems," ''Philosophy &amp; Public Affairs'', 7(4), pp. [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2264960?uid=3739936&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21101568848421 302]-325.&lt;/ref&gt; or "in the small", as in the [[equity (economics)|equity]] of "how institutions distribute  specific benefits and burdens".&lt;ref&gt;The latter is the subject of [[H. Peyton Young]], 1994, ''Equity: In Theory and Practice'', Princeton University Press, discussed in general terms and as quoted, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=H0IQ0PKZ4WYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA6=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 6-7];  [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5379.html description], [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=H0IQ0PKZ4WYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false preview], and [http://www.econ.jhu.edu/People/Young/scans/Equity.pdf chapter 1] (via [[scrolling]]).&lt;/ref&gt;  That theory may or may not elicit acceptance. In the [[JEL classification codes|Journal of Economic Literature classification codes]] 'justice' is scrolled to at [[JEL classification codes#Microeconomics JEL: D Subcategories|JEL: D63]], wedged on the same line between '[[Equity (economics)|Equity]]' and '[[Economic inequality|Inequality]]' along with 'Other Normative Criteria and Measurement'.  Categories above and below the line are [[Externalities]] and [[Altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;• Peter J. Hammond, 1987. "altruism," ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'', v. 1, pp. 85-87.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • James Andreoni, William T. Harbaugh, and Lise Vesterlund, 2008.

As to the latter, [[Paul Samuelson]] (1947),&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Samuelson, 1947. ''[[Foundations of Economic Analysis]]'', ch. VIII ("Welfare Economics"), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; expanding on work of [[Abram Bergson]], [[representation (mathematics)|represents]] a social welfare function in general terms as any ethical belief system required to order any (hypothetically feasible) social states for the entire society as "better than", "worse than", or "indifferent to" each other. [[Kenneth Arrow]] (1963) showed a difficulty of trying to extend a social welfare function consistently across different hypothetical [[ordinal utility function]]s even apart from justice.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth J. Arrow, 1963. ''[[Social Choice and Individual Values]]'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;  Utility maximization survives, even with the rise of [[ordinal utility|ordinal-utility]]/[[Pareto efficiency|Pareto]] theory, as an ethical basis for [[economic policy|economic-policy]] judgments&lt;ref&gt;• Jonathan Riley, 2008.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Fahrenheit 9/11'' controversies}}
The content of the 2004 documentary film ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' generated controversy before, during, and after its release a few months prior to the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]]. The film, directed by [[Michael Moore]], criticizes the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s attempt to pursue [[Osama bin Laden]] in the aftermath of the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]], as well as the [[Iraq War]]. Although ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' was generally praised by film critics and won various awards, Bush defenders and several other commentators criticized the film for inconsistencies, lack of context and for being made available online for free download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/5342052/ns/today-entertainment/t/fahrenheit-web-leak-stirs-controversy/|title='Fahrenheit 9/11' Web leak stirs controversy|publisher=MSNBC|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003002522/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/5342052/ns/today-entertainment/t/fahrenheit-web-leak-stirs-controversy/|archivedate=October 3, 2012|access-date=July 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2004-06-25/entertainment/moore.film_1_bin-michael-moore-iraq-war?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title=Moore defends ‘Fahrenheit’ |publisher=CNN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009113044/http://articles.cnn.com/2004-06-25/entertainment/moore.film_1_bin-michael-moore-iraq-war?_s=PM%3ASHOWBIZ |archivedate=October 9, 2012 |quote=Moore's film ... has come under attack from Bush defenders and some commentators. |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt;

==Ray Bradbury's title dispute==
The title of the film refers to [[Ray Bradbury|Ray Bradbury's]] novel ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' and the September 11 attacks of 2001. The ''Fahrenheit 451'' reference is emphasized by the film's tagline "''The temperature where freedom burns''" (compare with ''Fahrenheit 451's'' tagline, "''The temperature at which books burn''"). Moore has stated that the title came from the subject of an e-mail he received from a fan shortly after September 11.

Bradbury was upset by what he considered the appropriation of his title, and wanted the film renamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5324876/|title= "Fahrenheit 451" author wants title back|work=Hardball with Chris Matthews|date=June 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/ID/5319756/ |title=Call it a tale of two 'Fahrenheits'|publisher=MSNBC|date= June 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move America Forward's letter-writing campaign==
The conservative political action group [[Move America Forward]] mounted a letter-writing campaign pressuring theater chains not to screen the film, which it compared to "an [[al-Qaeda]] training video."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/entertainment/columnists/howard_gensler/8933698.htm?1c |author=Howard Gensler|title=Moore controversy over '9/11 Fahrenheit'|work=Philadelphia Daily News|date=June 16, 2004 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041119212806/http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/entertainment/columnists/howard_gensler/8933698.htm?1c |archivedate = November 19, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We've been causing them [the cinemas] an enormous amount of aggravation", said group member and talk radio host [[Melanie Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.salon.com/ent/feature/2004/06/23/fahrenhype/index_np.html |title=Michael Moore terrorizes the Bushies! |author=John Gorenfeld |work=Salon |date=June 23, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614085409/http://archive.salon.com/ent/feature/2004/06/23/fahrenhype/index_np.html |archivedate=June 14, 2006 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Citizens United's FEC challenge ==
[[Citizens United (organization)|Citizens United]], a conservative group run by [[David Bossie]], filed a complaint before the [[Federal Election Commission]] charging that ads for the film constitute political advertising and thus may not be aired 60 days before an election or 30 days before a party convention. On August 5, the FEC unanimously dismissed the complaint finding no evidence that the movie's ads had broken the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fec.gov/press/press2004/20040806mur.html FEC finding] August 6, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; A further complaint filed in 2005 was also rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fec.gov/press/press2005/20050809mur.html FEC finding] August 9, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy over the film's content ==

Shailagh Murray described ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' as a "harshly satirical and controversial portrait of the Bush presidency."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Shailagh. "Fahrenheit 9/11 Has Recruited Unlikely Audience: U.S. Soldiers", ''The Wall Street Journal''. July 12, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Dalton of ''[[The Times]]'' wrote that the movie "hits enough of its satirical targets to qualify as an important and timely film."&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Stephen. [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/dvd/article493041.ece Fahrenheit 9/11], ''The Times''. October 16, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Desson Thomson]] says "there is more to ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' than partisan ridicule. ... What's remarkable here isn't Moore's political animosity or ticklish wit. It's the well-argued, heartfelt power of his persuasion."&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Desson. "Fahrenheit 9/11: Connecting with a Hard Left'', ''The Washington Post''. May 18, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Author and blogger [[Andrew Sullivan]] expressed the opposite view, writing that Moore's film is "deeply corrosive of the possibility of real debate and reason in our culture."&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Andrew. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,994630,00.html Blinded By The Light], ''Time'' magazine. July 12, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian journalist [[Linda McQuaig]] wrote in response to Sullivan: "Hell, the media shut down real debate long ago. It is precisely because the debate has been so thoroughly corroded by the mainstream media ... that Moore's film is being so gratefully received by so many."&lt;ref&gt;McQuaig, Linda. "Fahrenheit 9/11 Places Real Issues in the Spotlight", ''The Toronto Star''. July 11, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Denis Hamill considers ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' to be a "corrective to the daily drumbeat of right-wing [[talk radio]]."&lt;ref name="hamill"&gt;Hamill, Denis.

[[English-American]] journalist and literary critic [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] politician [[Ed Koch]] contend that ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' contains distortions and untruths and is propaganda.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2004/06/unfairenheit_911.html|title=Unfairenheit 9/11: The lies of Michael Moore|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|date=June 21, 2004|work=[[Slate magazine]]|accessdate=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="koch"&gt;Koch, Edward.

July 26, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens also compared Michael Moore to [[Leni Riefenstahl]] in his critique for ''Slate'' magazine: "Here we glimpse a possible fusion between the turgid routines of [[MoveOn.org]] and the filmic standards, if not exactly the filmic skills, of [[Sergei Eisenstein]] or Leni Riefenstahl."&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt; He later labeled Moore "a completely promiscuous opportunist [and] extremely callous person."&lt;ref name="scarborough" /&gt;

Author and political commentator Peter Holding called Hitchens' analogy "hysterical, unfair and offensive," adding that "some of the criticism directed towards Moore's film displays the very same characteristics for which Moore's film has been criticised". Fellow ''Slate'' columnist and Iraq war critic [[David Edelstein]], though generally supportive of the film, wrote ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' "is an act of counterpropaganda that has a boorish, bullying force", but called it a "legitimate abuse of power."&lt;ref&gt;Edelstein, David.

June 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent French intellectual [[Bernard-Henri Lévy]] agreed the war was "a bad idea", but was sympathetic to the [[neoconservative]] point of view and disagreed with what he perceived to be the film's "core" argument, that "we have no reason to be interfering" in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Broudy, Oliver.

April 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Scarborough]] alleges that Moore has ducked criticism and dodged interviews from both himself and Hitchens.&lt;ref name="scarborough"&gt;Scarborough Country for June 30, [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5344115/ Transcript], MSNBC ''Scarborough Country'', July 1, 2004.{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore has published both a list of facts and sources for ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' and a document establishing agreements between the points made in his film and the findings of the [[National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|9/11 Commission]] (the independent, bipartisan panel directed by Congress and Bush to investigate the facts and circumstances surrounding the September 11 attacks).&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Michael. [http://www.michaelmoore.com/warroom/f911notes/ Factual Back-Up For Fahrenheit 9/11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041010190803/http://www.michaelmoore.com/warroom/f911notes/ |date=October 10, 2004 }}, michaelmoore.com, July 10, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bush reading to school children ===

Early on in the film, Moore explains that Bush continued reading "[[The Pet Goat]]" with a classroom of second graders at [[Emma E. Booker Elementary School]] in [[Sarasota, Florida]] for an extended period of time after being told of the attacks.

The school's principal, Gwendolyn Tose'-Rigell, explained, "I don't think anyone could have handled it better. What would it have served if he had jumped out of his chair and ran out of the room?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Sarasota principal defends Bush from 'Fahrenheit 9/11' portrayal |publisher=THE ASSOCIATED PRESS |date=June 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the schoolchildren, now grown, have expressed similar views; Mariah Williams, one of the students, stated in 2011 that, "I'm just glad he didn't get up and leave because then I would have been more scared and confused."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2069327,00.html#ixzz1LKYKu5YU The Interrupted Reading: The Kids with George Bush on 9/11], Time.com, May 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[9/11 Commission]] Staff Report entitled ''Improvising a Homeland Defense'' said: "The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/staff_statement_17.pdf| title=Improvising a Homeland Defense| format=PDF}}, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;

According to senior White House correspondent [[Bill Sammon]] and his inside look at the Bush administration's response to 9/11, ''Fighting Back: The War on Terrorism from Inside the White House'', Press Secretary [[Ari Fleischer]] was holding up a legal pad upon which he had written a message telling Bush not to say anything yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Suddenly, a time to lead | author=Bill Sammon |work=The Washington Times |date=October 7, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Christopher Hitchens crop 2.jpg|thumb|Christopher Hitchens]]
According to Christopher Hitchens, Moore had argued in a previous public debate that [[Osama bin Laden]] was to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and thus questions the treatment of bin Laden in the film. "Something – I cannot guess what, since we knew as much then as we do now – has since apparently persuaded Moore that Osama Bin Laden is as guilty as hell. Indeed, Osama is suddenly so guilty and so all-powerful that any other discussion of any other topic is a dangerous 'distraction' from the fight against him. I believe that I understand the convenience of this late conversion."&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt; Hitchens was subsequently invited to appear on Joe Scarborough's [[MSNBC]] talk show, ''[[Scarborough Country]]'', at which point a tape recording of his debate with Moore at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] in 2002 was replayed.&lt;ref name="scarborough" /&gt;

{{quote|text='''Moore:''' It seems as if he and his group were the ones who did this, then they should be tracked down, captured, and brought to justice.&lt;br&gt;
'''Hitchens:'''  What is the "if" doing in that last sentence of yours?&lt;br&gt;
'''Moore:'''  Well, all people are innocent until proven guilty in this country. ...  Even the worst piece of scum.&lt;br&gt;
'''Hitchens:'''  I feel I have to press you on that.  You regard it as an open question, the responsibility of Osama bin Laden?&lt;br&gt;
'''Moore:'''  Until anyone is convicted of any crime, no matter how horrific the crime, they are innocent until proven guilty.  And as Americans...&lt;br&gt;
'''Hitchens:'''  No, that's all I asked you.&lt;br&gt;
'''Moore:'''  Never leave that position.&lt;br&gt;
'''Hitchens:''' I'm sorry. So bin Laden's claims of responsibility strike you as the ravings of a clown's, say?}}

When the video ended, Hitchens proceeded to explain: "Why does someone who thought that Osama was innocent and Afghanistan was no problem suddenly switch in this way?  Because unless he says that he was dead wrong all along and Osama Laden was innocent and wronged, he can't say that everything else is a distraction from the hunt for Osama." Host Joe Scarborough agreed with Hitchens and criticised Moore for inconsistency, accusing him of "hypocrisy" for assuming bin Laden is innocent one minute "and yet, in this movie, at the very beginning, he criticizes George Bush for not assuming the [[bin Laden family]] is somehow guilty, then letting them out of the country."

''[[Flak Magazine|Flak]]'' magazine editor Stephen Himes, after watching ''Scarborough Country'' and reviewing a transcript of the Telluride debate, wrote that Hitchens had misconstrued Moore's remarks: "Hitchens actually performs some [[Bill Clinton|Clintonian]] semantic gymnastics here. Moore's ''if'' is not intending 'I think Osama is innocent and the Afghan war is unjustified;' he's trying to make an argument for American [[due process]]: 'If he and his group were the ones who did this, then they should be tracked down, captured and brought to justice'."&lt;ref name="himes"&gt;Himes, Stephen.

August 6, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic Christopher Parry also took issue with Hitchens' interpretation of Moore's remarks, writing "If you've got to build a case against [[Jeffery Dahmer]], you've got to build a case against Bin Laden."

{{quote|text=Allow me to explain Moore's motivation, as if it needed explaining to anyone with a concept of logic, law and due process. Bin Laden ''is'' innocent until proven guilty in the eyes of the law. That ''is'' the American Way. Indeed, it's the World Way. But in order to prove his guilt, one must build a case, capture him and put him to trial... But in ''Fahrenheit 9/11'', Moore has a different point to make. What he's saying in ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' is, why, exactly, when the pursuit of Osama Bin Laden is completely justified, have only 14,000 troops been sent after him, while ten times that number have been sent into Iraq to take over a country that had ''nothing to do with 9/11''?&lt;ref name="parry"&gt;Parry, Christopher.

[[CNN]] news anchor [[Daryn Kagan]] asked Moore why, if he is so willing to uphold the law, he could also be critical of the Bush administration for pursuing Osama bin Laden at the same time. Moore replied:

{{quote|text=Because if you have a suspect and the suspect gets away, the police, or our military, have a right to go after and get that suspect. In fact, they should go get the suspect. And [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]]'s point, and my point is, is that they make a half-hearted effort ... because they didn't want to divert resources from what their main goal was, which was to go in and invade Iraq. And that's what they've been about since Day 1.&lt;ref&gt;Kagan, Daryn.

=== Saudi flights ===
Moore implicates the [[White House]] in allowing relatives of Osama bin Laden to leave the United States without being interviewed at length by the [[FBI]]. In his narration in the movie, Moore states that "At least six private jets and nearly two dozen commercial planes carried the Saudis and the Bin Ladens out of the U.S. after September 13." Moore based this statement on the research of [[Craig Unger]], author of ''[[House of Bush, House of Saud]]'', whom he interviewed for the film. Passenger lists can be found at the House of Bush website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houseofbush.com/files.php |title=The Bush-Saudi Files: The Documents|author=Craig Unger|work=House of Bush, House of Saud |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927231352/http://www.houseofbush.com/files.php |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Approval of the flights====
[[File:Richard clarke.jpg|thumb|Richard Clarke]]
Christopher Hitchens points to a statement by former [[counterterrorism]] chief [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] when interviewed by ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' newspaper in May 2004, in which "he, and he alone, took the responsibility for authorizing [the] Saudi departures."&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt; Hitchens says that Moore interviewed Clarke and "either he didn't ask Clarke, who authorized those flights, or Clarke told him it was me and only me, and he didn't think it was good enough to use. ... Either way, that's below the level of trash TV, trash journalism."&lt;ref name="scarborough" /&gt; After quitting his White House position, Clarke became a prominent critic of the Bush administration's war on terrorism. Hitchens contends that the film does not mention Clarke's remarks so that it can criticize Bush for not going after Bin Laden's family, while holding up Clarke as a heroic, anti-war figure.&lt;ref name=slate /&gt;

The filmmaker defended himself in an interview with [[ABC News]] correspondent [[Jake Tapper]], answering: "Actually I do [display the] article and it's blown up 40 foot on the screen, you can see Richard Clarke's name right there saying that he approved the flights based on the information the FBI gave him. It's right there, right up on the screen. I don't agree with Clarke on this point. Just because I think he's good on a lot of things doesn't mean I agree with him on everything."&lt;ref name="tapper"&gt;Tapper, Jake. [http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=116504 Having His Say … Michael Moore Calls Fahrenheit 9/11 a Valid, Alternate View], ABC News. June 25, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore, on his website and in ''The Official Fahrenheit 9/11 Reader'', points to additional statements by Richard Clarke, also published in ''The Hill'', which he believes support his contention that the White House approved the flights.&lt;ref name="official_reader"&gt;Moore, Michael. ''The Official Fahrenheit 9/11 Reader'', Penguin Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a chronological summary:

* '''September 3, 2003''': In his testimony before the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]]'s [[U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security|Subcommittee on Terrorism]], Clarke said: "It is true that members of the bin Laden family were among those who left. We knew that at the time. I can't say much more in open session, but it was a conscious decision with complete review at the highest levels of the State Department and the [[FBI]] and the [[White House]]."&lt;ref&gt;York, Byron. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_18_55/ai_109411350 How did assorted bin Ladens get out of America after September 11?] ''National Review''. September 29, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''March 24, 2004''': In testimony to the [[9/11 Commission]], Clarke indicated that the request was not abnormal, "The Saudi embassy, therefore, asked for these people to be evacuated; the same sort of thing that we do all the time in similar crises, evacuating Americans. The request came to me and I refused to approve it." He goes on to explain that the FBI eventually approved the flights and he describes conversations in which the FBI has said that there was no one who left on those flights who the FBI now wants to interview.
* '''March 24, 2004''': "I would love to be able to tell you who did it, who brought this proposal to me, but I don't know. The two – since you press me, the two possibilities that are most likely are either the [[U.S. State Department|Department of State]] or the [[White House Chief of Staff]]'s Office. But I don't know."
* '''May 25, 2004''': In an interview with ''The Hill'' newspaper, published the following day, Clarke said: "I take responsibility for it. I don't think it was a mistake, and I'd do it again." He went on to say that "It didn't get any higher than me... On 9&amp;ndash;11, 9&amp;ndash;12 and 9&amp;ndash;13, many things didn't get any higher than me. I decided it in consultation with the FBI."

====The FBI's denial that it had a role in approving the flights====
On May 18, 2004, ''The Hill'' quoted [[FBI]] spokesman on counterterrorism [[John Iannarelli]] as denying that the FBI had any "role in facilitating these flights one way or another."&lt;ref name="wholetblsleave"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040629082831/http://www.hillnews.com/news/051804/binladen.aspx "Who let bin Ladens leave U.S.?"]; Bolton, Alexander; ''The Hill''. May 18, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI's denial of involvement was repeated to ''The Hill'' by another spokesperson, Donna Spiser, in a May 26, 2004 article. She is quoted as saying "We haven't had anything to do with arranging and clearing the flights."&lt;ref name="clarkeclaimsresp"&gt;Bolton, Alexander. "Clarke claims responsibility", ''The Hill''. May 26, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; She states that the FBI's involvement was limited to interviewing those people on the flight it thought were of interest: "We did know who was on the flights and interviewed anyone we thought we needed to."

====Alleged lack of cooperation from the White House====

The May 18 article in ''The Hill'', which was published prior to Clarke's May 25 claim of responsibility, quoted 9/11 Commission vice-chair [[Lee H. Hamilton]] as saying: "We don't know who authorized [the flights]. We've asked that question 50 times." A May 26 article in ''The Hill'' quoted another Commission member, Tim Roemer, as being unconvinced by Clarke's claim of sole responsibility for approving the flights: "It doesn't seem that Richard Clarke had enough information to clear it... I just don't think that the questions are resolved, and we need to dig deeper... Clarke sure didn't seem to say that he was the final decisionmaker. I believe we need to continue to look for some more answers."&lt;ref name="clarkeclaimsresp" /&gt;

Allegations concerning the Bush administration's refusal to provide information to the 9/11 Commission about the Saudi flights are disputed. The May 18, 2004 article in ''The Hill'' says that Commission vice-chairman Lee Hamilton "disclosed the administration's refusal to answer questions on the sensitive subject during a recent closed-door meeting with a group of Democratic senators, according to several Democratic sources." It also says that Republican Commission member [[John Lehman]] "said... that he told the senators the White House has been fully cooperative." President Bush, who met privately with the Saudi Arabian ambassador on the morning of Sept. 13, 2001, is suspected of personally authorizing the controversial flights while all other air travel had been halted.&lt;ref name="wholetblsleave" /&gt;

====Interviewing of bin Laden relatives====
Moore interviews author Craig Unger and retired FBI agent Jack Cloonan, both of whom say bin Laden family members were not questioned in a serious manner at length before being allowed to leave. The [[National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|September 11 Commission]] has found that 22 of the 26 people on the "bin Laden" flight were interviewed before being allowed to leave the country with many being asked "detailed questions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/staff_statement_10.pdf|title=Immediate Response to 9/11: The Saudi Flights|pages=12|format=PDF|work=National Commission On Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; A September 2, 2004 CNN news article reported that "However, in a recent interview with the AP, bin Laden's estranged sister-in-law said she does not believe that family members have cut [Osama] off entirely. [[Carmen Binladin]], who has changed the spelling of her name and lives in [[Switzerland]], said bin Laden is not the only religious brother in the family, and she expects his sisters to support him as well. 'They are very close to Osama,' she said."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/09/02/binladen.wealth.ap/ |title=Bin Laden's wealth not the force behind 9/11 |author=The Associated Press |date=September 2, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041026080104/http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/09/02/binladen.wealth.ap/ |archivedate=October 26, 2004 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=September 10, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Declassified FBI documents====

In June 2007, [[Judicial Watch]] published partially declassified FBI documents on the flights obtained under a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request.&lt;ref name="jwatch"&gt;{{cite web

In several cases, "Saudi travelers were not interviewed before departing the country, and F.B.I. officials sought to determine how what seemed to be lapses had occurred."&lt;ref&gt;Lichtblau, Eric.

=== War in Iraq ===
[[File:Iraq, Saddam Hussein (222).jpg|thumb|Saddam Hussein]]
The film suggests that the invasion of Iraq was an illegitimate attack on a sovereign nation – an unnecessary attack against an exaggerated threat. It makes a case against components of the [[Bush Doctrine]], specifically against the concepts of [[pre-emptive war]] combined with American [[unilateralism]]. The film also contends that the focus of the United States should have been directed elsewhere.

Christopher Hitchens criticized the film for not mentioning the history of repression, aggression, [[war crime]]s and the general state of [[human rights in Saddam Hussein's Iraq]], nor Iraq's noncompliance with numerous United Nations resolutions.&lt;ref name=slate /&gt; Hitchens writes, "in this peaceable kingdom, according to Moore's flabbergasting choice of film shots, children are flying little kites, shoppers are smiling in the sunshine, and the gentle rhythms of life are undisturbed. Then—wham! From the night sky come the terror weapons of American [[imperialism]]. Watching the clips Moore uses, and recalling them well, I can recognize various Saddam palaces and military and police centers getting the treatment. But these sites are not identified as such. In fact, I don't think [[Al Jazeera]] would, on a bad day, have transmitted anything so utterly propagandistic."&lt;ref name=slate /&gt; While interviewing Hitchens on his show, Scarborough claimed to be outraged at Moore's portrayal of the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]], claiming Moore's film suggests "those killing Americans in Iraq aren't the enemy, but rather they are the revolution and the [[Minutemen]], who are sure to win their battle against the occupation"&lt;ref name="scarborough" /&gt; and that "Moore says that the enemy is George Bush and Saddam Hussein and [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi|Mr. Zarqawi]] and Mr. Bin Laden are no problem. ... Indeed, they are the Minutemen. They're the staunch American revolutionaries."&lt;ref name="scarborough" /&gt;

Moore has frequently stated his opinion that Saddam was a brutal tyrant, though this opinion is not mentioned in the film. He said calling attention to Saddam's crimes was unnecessary considering the corporate media had continually pressed that point themselves, making it public knowledge.
{{cquote|Who doesn't know that Saddam was a bad guy? The media did a wonderful job hammering that home every day in order to convince the public that they should support the war. For 20 seconds in this film, I become essentially the only person to say, I want you to take a look at the human beings that were living in Iraq in 2003. [...] Anyone who takes that and says that I'm trying to say that Saddam's Iraq was some utopia is just a crackpot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fierman|first=Daniel|title=The Passion Of Michael Moore|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 9, 2004 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,659914,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Christopher Hitchens criticizes Moore for stating, in his film, that Iraq had not killed or attacked an American: "Moore asserts that Iraq under Saddam had never attacked or killed or even threatened (his words) any American. I never quite know whether Moore is as ignorant as he looks, or even if that would be humanly possible."&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt; Hitchens writes that [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] terrorists [[Muhammad Zaidan]] and [[Abu Nidal]] had been free to move in and out of [[Baghdad]], and that Saddam's armed forces had exchanged fire and killed American soldiers during the first [[Gulf War]]. When interviewed by Jake Tapper, Moore denied having said Hussein's regime had not ever killed an American, insisting his movie had been misquoted: "That isn't what I said. Quote the movie directly. ''Murdered''. The government of Iraq did not commit a premeditated murder on an American citizen."&lt;ref name="tapper" /&gt; His narration is reproduced verbatim in ''The Official Fahrenheit Reader'', including a chapter on critiques and supporting evidence.&lt;ref&gt;"Iraq," Moore's narration proceeds, is "a nation that had never attacked the United States. A nation that had never threatened to attack the United States. A nation that had never murdered a single American citizen." Moore, Michael.

====Children of members of Congress serving in Iraq====
[[File:Mark Kennedy, official photo portrait, color.jpg|thumb|Congressman Mark Kennedy]]
Moore says that only one member of Congress had a child serving in Iraq: [[United States Army|Army]] [[Staff Sergeant]] Brooks Johnson, the son of Senator [[Tim Johnson (U.S. Senator)|Tim Johnson]] (D-SD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/fahrenheit-911-facts/factual-back-up-for-fahrenheit-911-section-six |title=Factual Back-Up for Fahrenheit 9/11: Section Six |publisher=Michael Moore |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119052659/http://michaelmoore.com/words/fahrenheit-911-facts/factual-back-up-for-fahrenheit-911-section-six |archivedate=November 19, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Karen Kucher]], when ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' was nearing release to the home-video market, two additional Congressmen's children were stationed in Iraq: the son of Congressman [[Duncan L. Hunter]] (R-CA), [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] Lieutenant [[Duncan D. Hunter]] (who was later elected to Congress himself); and the son of [[Joe Wilson (U.S. politician)|Joe Wilson]] (R-SC), [[United States Army National Guard|Army National Guard]] [[Captain (land)|Captain]] Alan Wilson.&lt;ref name="SDUnion-Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040913/news_1m13duncan.html|title=Serving on two fronts|work=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]|author=Karen Kucher|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628201317/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040913/news_1m13duncan.html|archivedate=June 28, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fahrenheit 9/11'' also used footage of Moore confronting various members of Congress, encouraging them to enlist their own children to fight in Iraq. Moore approached Congressman [[Mark Kennedy (politician)|Mark Kennedy]] (R-MN) and showed Kennedy giving Moore a quizzical, confused look. Kennedy expressed displeasure about his portrayal, saying he offered to help Moore and also indicated he had a nephew serving in Afghanistan, but this was edited out of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A849-2004Jun23_3.html |title='Fahrenheit 9/11' Is a Red-Hot Ticket |work=Washington Post |author1=Hanna Rosin |author2=Mike Allen |date=June 24, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peter Damon lawsuit ===
Moore's inclusion of a 10-second clip with amputee Peter Damon has been criticized. Damon said the filmmaker "should be ashamed of himself" for claiming that soldiers were deceived into supporting the Iraq War and for using his injuries as reason to oppose the conflict. Damon "agree[s] with the President 100%. A lot of the guys down at [[Walter Reed Hospital|Walter Reed]] feel the same way." According to Damon's doctor, Lt. Col. Chester Buckenmaier, Moore took "a very positive thing we're doing for soldiers" who lost limbs and "used it to tell a lie." Responding to the criticism, associate producer Joanne Doroshow said, "Anybody who has seen the film knows we have nothing but the deepest respect for the soldiers who were wounded. One of the purposes of the movie was to examine the impossible situation they were put into and to raise questions about why they were sent there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sisk |first=Richard |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2004/08/15/2004-08-15_g_i__pans__9-11__role__hurt_.html |title=G.I. pans '9/11' role |publisher=New York ''Daily News'' |date=August 15, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009055305/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2004/08/15/2004-08-15_g_i__pans__9-11__role__hurt_.html |archivedate=October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Flame''''' is a controversial 1996 [[war film]] directed by [[Ingrid Sinclair]],&lt;ref name="newsreel1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsreel.org/nav/title.asp?tc=CN0034|title=Flame|publisher=California Newsreel|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced by [[Joel Phiri]] and [[Simon Bright]],&lt;ref name="zimmedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zimmedia.com/flame/|title=Flame|publisher=Zimmedia|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stars Marian Kunonga and Ulla Mahaka.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116317/|title=Flame (1998)|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first Zimbabwean film since independence set during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], and served as a tribute to the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]]'s many female guerrillas.&lt;ref name="newsreel1" /&gt;

==Plot==
In 1975, Florence, an impulsive young peasant girl from the [[Mashonaland]] countryside, decides to run away and join the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU) after her father is detained by the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]]. She and her friend Nyasha subsequently brave the dangers of the African bush on a long trek to a refugee camp in neighbouring [[Mozambique]], where they are trained as militants by ZANU's insurgent wing, ZANLA. Both adopt new revolutionary identities: Nyasha becomes ''Liberty'', representing her desire for self-sufficiency, while Florence brands herself ''Flame'', representing passion.

Life in the Mozambican refugee camps is hard: Flame and Liberty must learn to deal with the hardship and constant dangers of insurgent life. To complicate matters, some unscrupulous male guerrillas - such as Comrade Che, a ZANLA [[political commissar]], assume that female members of the party would be available to satisfy their sexual desires. When Flame rejects his advances, Che rapes and impregnates her with his child.

Although naturally devastated, Flame reconciles with Che and is shattered when he and their son are killed by a Rhodesian [[air strike]]. Determining she has nothing to live for but the conflict, Flame goes on to distinguish herself during ZANLA raids on farms and infrastructure. [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1980|Zimbabwean independence]] in the 1980s proves bittersweet for Flame, who finds it difficult adjusting to civilian life. Under [[Robert Mugabe]]'s new government, rural unemployment is rising, thousands continue to migrate to urban areas in search of work, and many ZANLA veterans - including Flame's new husband - feel disillusioned or ignored. Flame relocates to [[Harare]], where Liberty has used her background as an [[intelligence officer]] to secure a lucrative administrative post, although their reunion is short-lived: Flame wants assistance but Liberty no longer believes in the [[Collectivism|collectivist]] principles of mutual support and shared purpose once preached by ZANU during the bush war.

The two acquaintances finally attend a [[Heroes' Day]] party, nearly fifteen years after their struggle against white Rhodesia began, in an increasingly authoritarian Zimbabwe. They continue to greet passerby with the old [[Pan-Africanism|pan-Africa]]n slogan, ''"[[A luta continua]]"'' ("the struggle continues") as the film closes.

Ultimately, it passed Zimbabwean [[film censorship|censors]] and became a [[box office]] success and the number one film of the year in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="newsreel2" /&gt;

Hershey]], then Director of the [[Selective Service]]. '''General Hershey Bar''', '''General HersheyBar''', and '''General Hershy Bar''' spelling variants can be found in the General's own publications and those of the general public when referring to him.

==Biography==

Born William Arthur Matons in September 1906 and died October 13, 1993 (dates not verified).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Hershey Bar LC Linked Data Service (Library of Congress)|url=http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n97873128.html|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Matons danced under his birth name in the 1930s in the Modern Dance worlds of New York. Matons then began to use Calypso Kid, on stage and on the radio during the Calypso Craze of the 40s. He also used Calypso Joe, a stage name created when he was a [[calypso music|calypso]] dancer, promoter, night club owner in the 40s and 50s.&lt;ref name="Library of Congress"&gt;{{cite web|title=Matons, William - LC Linked Data Service|url=http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n97873128.html|website=Library of Congress|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in the 1960s he adopted the name General Hershy Bar. He kept the name the rest of his life, and most of the time in public he stayed 'in character' as part of his anti-war street-theater.

===Early life - Wisconsin to New York (1920s-early1930s)===
He was adopted and raised by Lithuanian parents who encouraged his ad-lib performing talents. He was a modern dancer and choreographer in New York in the 1930s. He was born in Cleveland Ohio, the son of gypsy immigrants. His father settled down to a life making violins in Cleveland, and then moved shortly to Racine, Wisconsin where Matons went to grade school. The family then moved to Milwaukee where he attended a semester of high school before going to work in the steel mills. After this job he was a steeple-jack, coast guardsman, cook on a yacht, and also sold jewelry. He read books on dancing and found notice of [[Charles Weidman]] dance scholarships in New York City. After only three months with Weiman's group he appeared in ''Americana''. In his twenties he was dance director of ''Railroads on Parade'' at the NY World's Fair and danced in ''As Thousands Cheer''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dornbrook|first1=Don|title=Wisconsin Man Became America's "Calypso King": Concert Dancer Matons First Introduced Trinidad Folk Music to New York|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19470204&amp;id=Tx0aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BSUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6177,1680851&amp;hl=en|accessdate=31 January 2016|work=The Milwaukee Journal: Green Sheet|publisher=The Journal Company|date=4 February 1047|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern dance career in New York (1930s)===
During the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], the NY modern dance world was influenced by the politics of the left as covered in Ellen Graf's book, ''Stepping Left Dance and Politics in New York City 1928-1942''. Bill Matons appears on the cover of this book in the center.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Stepping Left: Dance and Politics in New York City, 1928-1942|last = Graff|first = Ellen|publisher = [[Duke University Press]]|year = 1997|isbn = 9780822319481|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

William, or Bill Matons danced with the [[Humphrey-Weidman]] company in New York, from 1933 to 1936 and again in 1940. He appeared in the [[Charles Weidman]] works, ''Ringside'', ''Studies in Conflict'', ''Candide'' (1933), ''Traditions'' (1935), and ''American Saga'' (1936) &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = José Limón: An Unfinished Memoir - Volume 17 of Studies in dance history|last = Limon|first = Jose|publisher = [[Wesleyan University Press]]|year = 2001|isbn = 9780819565051|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''Americana'', ''As Thousands Cheer(1933)'', and ''Everywhere I Roam''. He was director of the experimental unit of the New Dance League, which evolved from the Workers Dance League between 1931-1935.

As Thousands Cheer, by Irving Berlin and [[Moss Hart]], opened Sept 30, 1933 at the [[Music Box Theatre|Music Box Theater]] and closed Sept 8, 1934, with 400 performances by the Charles Weidman dancers Letitia Ide and Jose Limon with William Matons and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/Whos_who/2684/40966/As-Thousands-Cheer|title = As Thousands Cheer PlaybillVault.com|date = |access-date = February 5, 2016|website = The Playbill Vault|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 1936 at Bennington, Vermont, the New Dance League presented performances by [[Anna Sokolow]], Bill Matons, Fara Lynn, and Eva Desca.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; April 25, 1937 New Dance League presented Dances of Today at St. James Theater. Included at this show were, ''Songs of Protest - Lay Down Late and Sistern and Brethern'', ''Song for Soviet Youth Day'', ''Under the Swastika: Germans Think with Your Blood'', ''Though we be flogged''. Bill Matons also appeared in ''Letter to a Policeman in Kansas City''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1938 he danced some early poems of [[Kenneth Patchen]] in New York and is mentioned in Patchen's papers at the UCSC special collections archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt3r29q25b/entire_text/|title = Guide to the Kenneth Patchen Papers|date = |access-date = January 28, 2016|website = Online Archive of California|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was choreographer for the Lenin Peace Pageant at Madison Square Garden in 1937. Performed with [[Ailes Gilmour]] in "''Adelante''," a [[Works Progress Administration]] sponsored Broadway musical in 1939.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.1939nyworldsfair.com/ftp/39_RR_PlayBill.PDF|title = 1939 NY Worlds Fair Play Bill for Railroads on Parade|date = 1939|accessdate = 7 January 2016|website = 1939 NY Worlds Fair|publisher = 1939 NY Worlds Fair Play Bill|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Adelante'', a work with a Spanish theme, opened April 4, 1939 at Daly's Theater and had 16 performances and Matons created the leading role and danced it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The show included [[Helen Tamiris]] among others. Tamiris was important in the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] Federal Dance Project and believed strongly in using dance to explore social themes.

Matons led the Experimental Dance Group in the late 1930s. His dancers included a young [[Rebecca Lepkoff]]. He choreographed for the [[1939 New York World's Fair|1939 Worlds Fair]] in New York, creating the dance for ''Railroads on Parade - Drama of Transport''. The music for this was written by [[Kurt Weill|Kurt Weil]]. Weil had started the score in spring 1938. It was written as a Circus Opera using the elements of theater music from opera to circus. Matons hired [[Rebecca Lepkoff]] for the Worlds Fair show and as he could pay a decent wage, uncommon at during the depression, Lepkoff used this money to buy her first camera, starting her photography career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Life on the Lower East Side: Photographs by Rebecca Lepkoff, 1937-1950|last = Lepkoff|first = Rebecca|publisher = [[Princeton Architectural Press]]|year = 2006|isbn = 9781568986067|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author Ramsay Burt described how Matons choreographed and produced, ''One Sixth of the Earth'' while with Humphrey-Weidman. Burt notes that Matons used the motif of "...poignant speeches by anonymous witnesses in the crowd...derived from the tradition of agit-prop Living Newspapers with origins in the Soviet Union".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Alien Bodies: Representations of Modernity, 'Race' and Nation in Early Modern Dance|last = Ramsay|first = Burt|publisher = Routledge|year = 2002|isbn = 9781134758340|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939 Matons was still working with [[Doris Humphrey]] in the Humphrey-Weidman company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Days on Earth: The Dance of Doris Humphrey|last = Siegel|first = Marcia B.|publisher = [[Duke University Press]]|year = 1993|isbn = 9780822313465|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calypso period (late 1930s to 1950s)===
In 1938 while with Humphrey and Weidman he began to focus on calypso dance and music. Earlier in his life, while working on a boat, he heard the music while working on a ship stopped in [[Trinidad]] (1935), but he had not considered the dance aspect at that time. He found a Spanish music store in [[Harlem]] owned by Costellanos Molinas, brought some music home, and made up some dances in 1938. He coached performers from the West Indies in dances and stage techniques to improve their showmanship. He started to import singers to the US and began to have a monopoly on calypso there.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Late 1938 he brought calypso to New York City night life at the Village Vanguard with the Duke of Iron, Gerald Clark and his Calypso Serenaders and a half dozen dancers. The show included satirical acts on important issues of the day. The Calypso Kid stages the revues at the Vanguard with the songs "Edward the VIII" or "Roosevelt in Trinidad" made into small skits with pantomime and dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Island Sounds in the Global City: Caribbean Popular Music and Identity in New York, ISAM MONOGRAPHS.34|last = Allen|first = Ray|publisher = University of Illinois Press|year = 1998|isbn = 0252070429|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matons and his calypso crew traveled the US and beyond performing shows. Calypso was still a fairly niche market until Joe Miller a radio comic brought the song, "Rum and Coco-Cola" to the US in 1945. A calypso craze swept the nation following this. Many of the songs were banned from radio play at the time due to the earthy nature of many calypso songs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Matons' importance in the start of the Calypso Craze is noted in the book, "Encuentros sincopados: el caribe contemporáneo a través de sus prácticas musicales -''Historia (Siglo Veintiuno Editores) Pensamiento caribeño''" by Lara Ivette Lopez de Jesus; "...there never was any organized dance for the calypso; therefore no calypso dance ever existed in reality, only in name...The first person who organized such a dance was an American named Bill Maton{{sic|expected=Matons}}, a dancer. He had visited Trinidad in 1935, and appeared in shows in the US and Canada"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encuentros sincopados: el caribe contemporáneo a través de sus prácticas musicales Historia (Siglo Veintiuno Editores) Pensamiento caribeño|last = Lopez de Jesus|first = Lara Ivette|publisher = Siglo XXI|year = 2003|isbn = 9682324319|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 40s and 50s he was performing with [[Calypso music|calypso]] singers and operating a night club in NY where he used the name Calypso Kid and then Calypso Joe. A picture of him as Calypso Joe in costume in 1952 is on the Dallas Library Site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://catalog.dallaslibrary.org/polaris/search/title.aspx?ctx=1.1033.0.0.6&amp;pos=1|title = Dallas Library Catalog|date = 1952|access-date = February 5, 2016|website = Dallas Public Library|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A notice in Billboard for April 7, 1945 mentions him coming to Hollywood, "...now that Rum and Coca Cola is hot..." with his revue of calypso stars [[Lord Beginner]], Lord Caresser, Lord Dignity, Chief Eagle Eye, [[The Duke of Iron]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uBEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PT29&amp;ots=wC8eRb9rtY&amp;dq=bill%20matons%20calypso&amp;pg=PT29#v=onepage&amp;q=bill%20matons%20calypso&amp;f=false|title = Billboard|last = |first = |date = April 7, 1945|work = |access-date = January 28, 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He operated a calypso night club in [[Honolulu]] in the 1950s.

[[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation]] in Los Angeles came out with Calypso Joe (1957) starring [[The Duke of Iron]] and [[Angie Dickinson]] among others. Papers noted that it did not include Matons, or compensate him for the use of the name he had spent years building up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FOElAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=o_QFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6510%2C1718578|title = "Calypso Joe Film Irks Calypso Joe", Washington Afro-American, April 9th, 1957, page 6|last = |first = |date = |work = |access-date = Jan 28, 2016|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-war work (1960s to 1990s)===
In Los Angeles he self-published several monographs and booklets using the publishing company he created, Handicap Publications. The PeaceNut cartoons were published by Handicap, showing a business location of 5420 Carlton Way, Hollywood, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Those Lovable Peace-Nuts page 7|url = http://www.berkeleycitizen.org/Dunphy/peacenut6.htm|website = www.berkeleycitizen.org|accessdate = 2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Handicap Pictures was established for producing short films in "true bloody color", as he said. Titles included, ''[[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] the Defoliate President'', and ''Damn the constitution-undeclared wars-full speed ahead'' with the theme song ''your lyin’ cheat in’ heart'' and he mentions his saying "give war no quarter because it ain’t worth a dime" in one. He published his book, ''kiss don't kill" in 1967 (Handicap Publications).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kiss Don't Kill (book) WorldCat.org|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/kiss-dont-kill/oclc/21615389|website=OCLC WorldCat|publisher=Handicap Publications|accessdate=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another publication was "Get off your apathy!: a biography of [[Florence Beaumont]], who burned herself instead of others! —like phony politicians", by Thomas Michael Dunphy (aka "General Wastemoreland"), Handicap Publications 1968.

[[File:6141 Afton Place, Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|The Afton Arms Apartments, 6141 Afton Place, Los Angeles CA (aka Malaga Castle]]).

In 1972 he became the manager of an apartment building in Hollywood, CA. The 42-unit Afton Arms Apartments were built in 1924 at 6141 Place and El Centro in Los Angeles by architect Leland Bryant. The building was the site of many important dissident activities, [[Hollywood blacklist#The Hollywood Ten and other 1947 blacklistees|The Hollywood Ten]] and [[Art Kunkin]]'s [[Los Angeles Free Press|LA Free Press]] both used the Grand Ball room. In 1987, [[Hillel Slovak]] of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] was found dead in his apartment in the building where he lived. The General renamed the building "The Happy Malaga Castle" in 1972&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1995-09-20/news/ls-47830_1_beautiful-buildings LA times article], LA times.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 he was one of the participants at the first [[Doo Dah Parade]], an irreverent alternative to the traditional formality of the [[Rose Parade]] in Pasadena. Through the late 1970s to early 1980s he lived on Harvard Blvd in Hollywood, CA. In Hollywood he would 'perform' his anti-war guerrilla street theater for tourists to [[Grauman's Chinese Theater]] and other [[Hollywood Boulevard]] locations, including while on the RTD bus he got around on. He died October 13, 1993. He was frequently seen partnered with General Waste More Land (aka Tom Dunphy), a parody of [[William Westmoreland|General William Westmoreland]]. The characters were common at [[street theater]] performances and demonstrations against U.S. military involvement in [[Vietnam]]. Tom Dunphy (aka "General Waste More Land") still lives in Berkeley Ca (see video below). He would greet people on the street he met as "General" and salute often as well, which was saying that we are all Generals and so complicit in war.

* In 1969 General Hershey Bar supposedly showed up at the [[Altamont Free Concert|Altamont free concer]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t in California where performers included the [[Rolling Stones]].

It is likely that he actually did not appear in the movie, but that this was someone else. There was a case brought by General Hershy Bar regarding the use of his image in the Altamont concert movie by the Rolling Stones. In that case he says it was not him, but General Waste More Land that appears in the movie.

Generically, the word '''goof''' is another term for a [[wikt:mistake|mistake]]. However, the term is also used in a number of specific senses. Several origins have been proposed for the word. According to Merriam-Webster, "goof" is likely a variation of "goff" in an English dialect, meaning simpleton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/goof |title=Definition Merriam Webster |access-date=2007-07-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923143438/http://mw1.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/goof |archive-date=2009-09-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some say the word may come from an identically pronounced [[Hebrew]] word meaning "body", some even say it was just a mistake happened while typing the word " good", hence the word "goof" is also known as other word for mistake. Others believe that it was inspired by the [[Disney]] character, [[Goofy]] (though it is more likely that the character got his name from the word, not the word from the character). See the etymological explanation of [[wikt:Hessu Hopo|Hessu Hopo]], 'Goofy' in Finnish language.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Thomas sticky tack face.jpg|250px|thumb|A [[Goof (Thomas &amp; Friends)|goof]] within ''[[Thomas &amp; Friends]]'']] --&gt;
There is a Spanish word, "gofio," which refers to the balls of toasted flour and salt eaten by the original inhabitants of the [[Canary Islands]]. In Latin America (esp. Cuba) the word "comegofio" (lit. "gofio-eater") came to refer to anyone from the Canaries, stereotyped as primitive or stupid.

==Cinema==
In [[filmmaking]], a '''goof''' is a mistake made during film production that finds its way into the final released picture. Depending upon the film and the actual scene, the goof may have different effects: a loss in [[Realism (dramatic arts)|realism]], an annoyance, or it could just be funny. It is often a type of [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] error. Goofs are also known as "[[blooper]]s"&lt;ref&gt;Normally used on the [https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Goofs/ IMDb site]for bloopers. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410142828/http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Goofs/ |date=2010-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "mistakes".

There are several types of goofs, for example:
* Somebody or something from the film crew is in the picture that wasn't planned (e.g., [[camera]] and cameraman is reflected in a mirror, or the [[microphone]] is visible, a rope pushing a character over is visible, a hook pulling a character up in the air is visible).
* [[Chronology|Chronological]] or conditional errors (e.g. a [[cigarette]] getting longer with the next scene, a cup or glass gaining in volume in the next scene, damage to a building that disappears, or moved props)
* Historical inaccuracies and anachronisms (e.g., an [[High-definition television|HDTV]] set in a film set in the 1970s, radio tower in cowboy movie).
* Geographic: an object or landmark reveals the scene was filmed in a different city than the city it is set. This is very common in [[Hollywood]] films that are shot in [[Canada]].
* Problems in audio or soundtrack (e.g. a [[dog]] barking before its mouth moves, a person's lips carry on moving after they have finished speaking).
* [[Intertitles]] displaying wrong words (e.g. a character called "John" may have his name misspelled ''Jhon'' in the subtitles by accident).

Goofs can be found in a large number of films, even in very expensive productions. ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'' for example has been counted to have 200 goofs in it, ranging from disappearing props, to a storm trooper hitting his head on an opening door.

==Other uses==

In broader usage, a goof is a mistake, or a foolish person. In the context of foolishness, the word was a favorite of [[Dennis Farina]] on the TV series ''[[Crime Story (TV series)|Crime Story]]''.

It can also be a synonym for funny, awesome, silly, dumb, or hysterical, and is often used to express someone who is particularly silly and takes the silliness to another level; such as the Disney character Goofy.

"Goof" can also be extended into "goofball" or "goofer" a term which describes one who is goofy, foolish, silly or ludicrous. In some urban communities the term "goofy yute" is commonly used.

In some parts of Canada, "goof" has been used in the prison system, mainly associated with child abusers and later used to describe sexual offenders of any sort. Sometimes, the inmate who has been called a "goof" must defend himself with physical violence against the inmate who called him that name. It also is used, especially in Canadian elementary and high schools, as a general insult.

'''Gunnar Brunvoll''' (6 June 1924 &amp;ndash; 27 April 1999) was a Norwegian impresario and opera administrator. He was co-founder of Norsk Operaselskap, and was manager at [[Norwegian National Opera and Ballet|Den Norske Opera]] for more than twenty years.

==Personal life==
Brunvoll was born in [[Bærum]] as a son of [[Jonas Brunvoll, Sr.|Jonas Brunvoll]] and [[Kirsten Brunvoll|Kirsten Sørsdal]], and was a brother of singer [[Jonas Brunvoll, Jr.|Jonas Brunvoll]]. He was married to Solveig Pettersen.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Gunnar Brunvoll |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Bjørn |last=Simensen |authorlink= |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=http://snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Gunnar_Brunvoll/utdypning |language=Norwegian |accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]] he was involved in the civil resistance movement, including editing of the [[Underground media in German-occupied Europe|illegal newspaper]] ''Norge''.&lt;ref name=luihn-1960&gt;{{cite book|title=De illegale avisene |first=Hans |last=Luihn |pages=47–48 |publisher=Universitetsforlaget |location=Oslo / Bergen |year=1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both his parents and his brother Jonas ended up in [[concentration camp]]s in Germany,&lt;ref name=fangenskap&gt;{{cite book|title=Nordmenn i fangenskap 1940&amp;ndash;1945 |editor-first=Kristian |editor-last=Ottosen|editor-link=Kristian Ottosen |page=151 |publisher=Universitetsforlaget |location=Oslo |year=2004 |origyear=1995 |edition=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Gunnar escaped to Sweden and further to Great Britain and Canada, where he was trained as a pilot at the training camp [[Little Norway]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christensen|first=Trygve|title=Bærum og krigen 1940–1945|publisher=Bærum Bibliotek |location=Bæeum |year=1995|page=104&amp;ndash;107 |isbn=82-991713-5-0|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Brunvoll did not continue his military career after World War II. In 1945 he established his own impresario and concert agency. The agency introduced strongmen, illusionists and performing artists.

==Synopsis==
The film is about a protagonist's journey from religious hatred to love with the theme of the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|partition of Bengal]] in the background. Its relevance in the present environment clouded by religious extremism was widely unrecognised. This is the story of Saket Ram, as narrated by his grandson. The film takes place as Ram, a retired archaeologist, lies on the deathbed, on 6 December 1999, the 7th anniversary of the [[Demolition of the Babri Masjid|destruction of the Babri Mosque]] in [[Ayodhya]].

==Plot==
{{Plot|film|date=July 2018}}
The movie begins at present day with Saket Ram ([[Kamal Haasan]]), an 89-year-old Hindu man at his death bed in [[Madras]]. He is being taken care of by his grandson Saket Ram Junior, a famous novelist who writes historical fiction, and their family doctor, Munawar. Ram Jr. explains how he grew up listening to his grandfather's stories. He then narrates one of his grandfather's strangest stories that he plans to use for his next novel. As Ram Jr. narrates the story, Ram is reminded of it.

The scene reverts to the 1940s, when he and his good friend, Amjad Ali Khan ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) are archaeologists working together under their boss, [[Mortimer Wheeler]], in [[Mohenjo-daro]] in the [[Sindh|Sindh province]] in what was then North-West India. Relations are pleasant between the Indians and the English. Saket and Amjad do not approve of [[partition of India|partition]] and the [[creation of Pakistan|creation]] of [[Pakistan]]. Although many [[Indian Muslims]] plan to move to Pakistan, Amjad decides to stay in India as he believes it is his homeland and he does not wish to live under [[Sharia]] law.

After the archaeological site is shut down out of fear of riots, young Ram returns to Calcutta to be with his wife, Aparna ([[Rani Mukherjee]]), a school teacher. On his way home, he witnesses the riots and chaos over the issue of the formation of Pakistan and the call by [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]], the founder of modern Pakistan, for [[Direct Action Day|"Direct Action"]]. While out to get some food, Ram manages to save an innocent [[Sikh]] girl from the hands of a Muslim gang. When he returns to his house, he finds a group of Muslims entering his house. They brutally rape and murder Aparna. Saket, unable to cope with his tragic loss, kills the Muslims who raped and killed his wife in a fit of rage.

Outside his house, he runs into Shriram Abhyankar ([[Atul Kulkarni]]), who is part of a Hindu nationalist group determined to fight the Muslims' malice and persecution with similar brute force, and assassinate Gandhi for what they perceive to be his treachery towards Hindu dominated India. Gandhi wants Hindus and Muslims to co-exist peacefully with a hope of winning over the hearts of the rioters through sheer self-pity, but Abhyankar and his fellow extremists have lost patience at what they deemed Gandhi's unreasonable stand to appease the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] and their demand for Pakistan.

Back in his hometown of [[Thanjavur]], Ram's Uncle Bahsyahm and Aunt Vasanthato urge him to remarry. He is then married to the daughter of family friends, Mythili ([[Vasundhara Das]]). While his wedding is being celebrated across the village, Ram tells his childhood friends Vedha and Yegham that he has no reason to be happy since the world's biggest political divorce is going on with the separation of [[Pakistan]] in the north. During his first night, he learns that Mythili, like her family, are supporters of Gandhi and that the Mahatma will be visiting [[Calcutta]] a few days later on the anniversary of the bloody riots. Ram travels to [[Calcutta]] alone and learns that a Mr. Nair now lives at his old apartment. Nair gives him a goddess painting drawn by Aparna not long before her death. Later that night, Ram joins a mob that confronts Gandhi and [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy|Suhrawardy]], then [[Prime Minister of Bengal|Chief Minister of Bengal]], about the bloody riots. When questioned about whether they take full responsibility for the riots, both of them accept and ask for forgiveness. The mob forgives them, but Ram refuses to.

Although Ram remains aloof at first, he slowly falls in love with Mythili. However, on their honeymoon in  [[Maharashtra]], Ram and Mythili bump into a disguised Abhyankar, who introduces them to a dethroned Maharaja. During a hunting trip with Abhyankar and the Maharaja, Ram is reunited with an old friend from [[Calcutta]], Manohar Lalwani ([[Saurabh Shukla]]) who lost his family and home in the riots. After seeing Lalwani's misery, Ram realizes he has still not gotten over Aparna's murder. Under Abhyankar's influence, Ram comes to the belief that Mahatma Gandhi is solely responsible for the division of India and of the two religions and also of having supported whom they viewed as the enemy. Hindu fundamentalists, including the Maharaja and Abhyankar, are furious and plot to murder Gandhi. Ram unwittingly becomes a part of their militant organization that plots to do away with Gandhi. Due to a horse-riding accident, Abhyankar has left a quadriplegic and has Ram swear that he will carry on his work, that of killing the Mahatma.

Back in present day, Ram Senior's situation worsens. Ram Junior tries to convince his father Mohan to accompany them to the hospital, but he is uninterested for some unknown reason. In the end, Ram Jr. and Munavar take him to the hospital but are stopped by the police since there are bomb blasts in Madras due to Hindu-Muslim communal riots. Ram asks "Even now?". A Muslim soldier, Ibrahim makes them hide in an underground shelter for their safety. As they try to stay silent to avoid being attacked by the mob, Ram reminisces about how he plotted to kill Gandhi many decades ago.

Back in newly independent India, Ram begins to prepare to assassinate Gandhi once he returns to Madras. A pregnant Mythili becomes worried as her husband grows more distant and invites her parents and in-laws over to cheer him up. However, Ram has made up his mind to end Gandhi's life and leaves home for Varanasi, where he goes through a purification ritual. Then, he heads for Delhi and unknowingly stays at the same hotel as another fundamentalist planning to kill Gandhi, [[Nathuram Godse]]. When the police arrive to question Godse, a paranoid Ram hides his gun in a truck. Later on, Ram goes to the soda factory in [[Chandni Chowk]] where the truck was heading to.

In Chandni Chowk, Ram is reunited with Amjad, who takes him to the soda factory. It is revealed that many Muslims civilians, including Amjad's wife Nafisa and their children, are hiding there out of fear of being attacked by Hindus during curfew. When it is discovered that Ram came there for a gun, the Muslims became suspicious that he might be out to kill them, attack him. A fight ensues that triggers a series of violent events in the area. While trying to escape both Hindu and Muslim mobs, Amjad finds out that Ram is in Delhi to assassinate Gandhi and he tries to convince his friend to not do it. He reveals that his father did not die of natural causes. He was murdered by a Hindu mob.

He begs him, kneeling and asking forgiveness for Aparna's death. He says he forgives Ram for his father's. Then he asks Ram to shoot him and tells him that he will take Ram's bullet if his death will grant both Hindus and Muslims peace. He says that he is willing to die if his death gets rid of the hatred that has turned Ram mad.

Just then, they are cornered by a Hindu mob who try to kill Amjad, but he is saved by Ram. Amjad is struck on the back of the head and Ram takes him back to the soda factory. Together, they then help protect the Muslims hiding in the soda factory until the authorities arrive to control the situation. Amjad is shot in the leg.

Amjad is fatally injured and is questioned by Officer Rao about the man who started the violence. He is asked about the fake name, Bhaivan, that Ram used since he arrived at his hotel.

Before dying, Amjad lies that he has never seen that man before, and all he knows is his brother Ram who despite everything, saved his life. He dies holding his brother's hand.

Ram then bumps into father-in-law and his friend who are there to meet Gandhi. He learns that his uncle and aunt have died after learning he has left. Gandhi requests to see Ram to invite him on his long walk to Pakistan after finding out he helped save innocent Muslims.  Ram ultimately changes his mind about Gandhi after seeing that his teachings are all about love and non-violence. He decides against assassinating the leader, and attempts to confess the truth to him in order to beg for forgiveness. However, it is too late as Gandhi is eventually killed by another assassin, Nathuram Godse. Ironically, Gandhi dies without his famous last words: "Hey Ram!" as popularly believed, and as in Richard Attenborough's film Gandhi.

Then on,  Ram lives by [[Gandhism|Gandhian principles]]. As the situation on the streets starts to cool down, Ram whispers his last words to his grandson and eventually dies. Before Ram Junior leaves with his grandfather's body, he learns that the soldier's name is Ibrahim and that he is a Muslim.

During his funeral, Gandhi's great-grandson [[Tushar Gandhi|Tushar]] comes and sees Ram Senior's private room which is full of historical photos. Ram Junior hands over Gandhi's footwear and spectacles which his late grandfather had previously collected from the place of the shootout and had treasured throughout his life.

==Production==
The shooting was started in  Madhava Perumal Temple, Mylapore. Violinist [[L. Subramaniam]] was selected to work as the music composer and completed recording songs for the project. However, before finishing his entire commitment for the film, he left the project fearing that his association with the film may offend [[Hindu]] people due to its contentious storyline.&lt;ref name="red"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/1999/nov/18kamal.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803154941/http://www.rediff.com/movies/1999/nov/18kamal.htm |archivedate= 3 August 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ilayaraaja]] was subsequently selected to replace him and helped score music over the version recorded by Subramaniam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenindia.com/old/jan28/music1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121035534/http://www.screenindia.com/old/jan28/music1.htm |archivedate=21 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His background score was recorded by a Symphony Orchestra for the second time for an Indian film, the first time being by Ilaiyaraaja himself three years before for the [[Malayalam]] epic ''[[Guru (1997 film)|Guru]]'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/Specials/98/August/Raja3.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924042411/http://www.indolink.com/tamil/cinema/Specials/98/August/Raja3.htm |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Subramaniam, the Sankaracharya of Kanchi, had also filmed an interview scene for the film but later requested that his portions were removed to avoid controversy.&lt;ref name="red"/&gt;

Actor [[Shah Rukh Khan]] did not ask for any remuneration from Kamal Haasan as he considered it an honour and privilege to work with one of his mentors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/SRK-didnt-take-money-for-Hey-Ram/articleshow/20313213.cms |title=SRK didn't take money for Hey Ram |work=The Times of India |date=29 May 2013 |accessdate=16 January 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015091010/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/SRK-didnt-take-money-for-Hey-Ram/articleshow/20313213.cms |archivedate=15 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Haasan initially intended to title the film as ''Satya Sodanai'', which loosely translates to ''My Experiments With Truth'', the title of [[Gandhi]]'s [[The Story of My Experiments with Truth|autobiography]].&lt;ref name="red"/&gt;
Role of Shriram Abhyankar played by [[Atul Kulkarni]] was supposed to do by noted Marathi actor [[Mohan Gokhale]], he had started working on film in Madras but suddenly he passed away due to heart attack in sleep, later Hassan roped Kulkarni another noted Marathi actor to do this role, becoming one of the best performance of his career.

Production on the film cost a total of {{Indian Rupees}}11 crore rupees, excluding Kamal Haasan's salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/mp/2004/09/22/stories/2004092200320100.htm|title=The Hindu : Metro Plus Chennai : No stopping him|website=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a speculation that the film would clash with [[Rajinikanth]] starrer [[Padayappa]]. Which proved to be untrue. 

=== Reviews ===
''Hey Ram'' received highly positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/04/21/stories/2003042100600200.htm|title=The Hindu : In a new avataar|website=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charu Nivedita]] wrote that the film is a self-declaration of Kamal Hassan's [[Hindutva]] agenda and added that the flm per se failed on artistic grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://charuonline.com/blog/?p=6276|title=ஹே ராம் – ஒரு இந்துத்துவ அஜெண்டா - Charuonline|website=charuonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; T Krithika Reddy from ''[[The Hindu]]'' wrote, "Live sound, prosthetic make-up (Micheal Westmore), splendid cinematography (Thiru), magnificent art work (Sabu Cyril) and painstakingly designed costumes (Sarika) are some of the other highlights of this magnum opus, which is distinct in style and content...The chemistry between Kamal and Rani is explosive to say the least. Shah Rukh Khan, as usual comes up with an impeccable performance. Vasundhara, as the stoic second wife makes an impressive debut. Naseerudin Shah as Gandhi steals a clear march over the others in supporting roles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/2000/02/25/stories/09250221.htm |title=Film Review: ''Hey!

He covered the [[entertainment industry]] for both ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' (1953–1960, 1979–1992) and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' (1992–2008)  during a career which spanned seven decades.&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite news|first=Pat|last=Saperstein |title=Hy Hollinger, Longtime Variety Reporter, Dies at 97 |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/hy-hollinger-dies-dead-variety-reporter-1201613764/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2015-10-08 |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thr&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Barnes |title=Hy Hollinger, Former THR Writer and International Editor, Dies at 97 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hy-hollinger-dead-thr-writer-780168 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2015-10-08 |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollinger helped to developed a new system for tracking the overseas [[box office]] while working for ''Variety's'' [[London]] bureau.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; He later served as the international editor at ''The Hollywood Reporter'' from 1992 until 2008, when he retired at the age of 90.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; Hollinger was considered an expert on the international box office and the sale independent productions directly to foreign [[film distributor]]s.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Hollinger was born '''Herman Hollinger''' in [[The Bronx]], [[New York City]], on September 3, 1918.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; He attended [[Townsend Harris High School]] in [[Queens, New York]].&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; He worked as a messenger and copy boy in the classified ad department at the ''New York Times'' on Saturdays from 1932 to 1935 as a high school student.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; During college, Hollinger landed an internship at [[CBS Radio]], which included a position assisting CBS' coverage of the [[1940 Republican National Convention]] in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; Hollinger graduated from [[City College of New York]] and received a [[master's degree]] from the [[Columbia School of Journalism]].&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

===Career===
He served in the [[Armed Forces Radio]] from 1942 to 1945 during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; Following the end of the war, Hollinger wrote for a weekly newspaper in [[suburban]] [[Philadelphia]] and worked as a [[sports reporter]] for the now defunct ''[[New York Morning Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;

Hollinger departed ''[[The Morning Telegraph]]'' to take a job as a [[publicist]] at [[Warner Bros.]].&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; He next joined ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', the weekly entertainment [[trade magazine]], from 1953 to 1960.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; While working under ''Variety's'' London bureau chief Don Grove, Hollinger co-developed a new system for tracking the overseas box office, which had been difficult to follow at the time.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;

Hollinger then returned to [[public relations]] as a publicity director for [[Paramount Pictures]]' [[Telemeter (pay television)|International Telemeter Company]], an experimental [[pay television]] operation, which existed during the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; He was later promoted, first to Paramount's European production publicity director, based in [[London]], and then to Paramount's "ad-pub", or Vice President of Marketing.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; He worked on some of Paramount's best known productions of the era, including the 1970 film, ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]''.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;
 
During the early 1970s, Hollinger left Paramount Pictures following a change in the studio's leadership.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; He worked in corporate public relations, beginning in 1972.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; His clients included the [[National Basketball Players Association]] and [[Sagittarius Productions]], owned by [[Edgar Bronfman, Sr.]], the head of [[Seagram]] at the time.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

In the late 1970s, Hollinger ran into [[Syd Silverman]], his former boss at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' during the 1950s, and Robert Hawkins, a Variety executive, in [[Midtown Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; His chance encounter with Silverman and Hawkins led Hollinger to rejoin the staff of ''Variety'' in 1979 as an associate editor focused on international issues within the industry.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; At the time of Hollinger's hiring, ''Variety'', based in New York City, and ''Daily Variety'', based in [[Hollywood]], essentially operated as distinct, separate media entities.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; The decision to hire Hollinger in 1979 marked "the first time in many years that weekly Variety will have its own editorial presence in the film capital," according to a story later published at the time.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

In 1980, Hollinger broke the story that the [[List of Cannes Film Festival juries (Feature films)|jury]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], chaired that year by [[Kirk Douglas]], had been surprised that a French film, ''[[My American Uncle]]'', had been awarded the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] by Cannes' organizers, despite the fact that the jury had rejected the film as the winner.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;

Hollinger also reported on the widespread dissatisfaction with the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and [[MIFED]], a now defunct [[film market]] held annually in [[Milan]].&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; International film merchants, based in Los Angeles, had to attend Cannes and MIFED, to sell their films to overseas markets during the 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; At the time, there were no comparable venues to sell U.S. films to the world markets held in the United States.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; His reports on the foreign sales monopolies held by Cannes and MIFED led to the establishment of the [[American Film Market]] (AFM) in 1981.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; Hollinger's work has been credited with the need an American alternative to Cannes and MIFED.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; Robert Meyers, a founding member and first chairman of the American Film Market, recalled asking other film executives, "Why are we all going to Cannes just to sell the American independent film, and why not right here in the U.S.?", after reading a series of Hollinger's stories in ''Variety''.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; The American Film Market, one of the film industry's leading marketplaces, is now held annually in [[Santa Monica, California]].&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

In 1992, Hollinger left Variety, to become the international editor of ''''The Hollywood Reporter''''. Hollinger served as ''The Hollywood Reporter's'' international editor from 1992 until 2008, when he retired at the age of 90.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;

Hy Hollinger died at [[Olympia Medical Center]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], on October 7, 2015, at the age of 97.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;  Hollinger's wife of 61 years, actress [[Gina Collens]], died on May 31, 2014, at the age of 90.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;&lt;ref name=thr2&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Barnes |title=Actress Gina Collens Dies at 90 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/actress-gina-collens-dies-at-714770 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2014-06-24 |accessdate=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by their daughter, Alicia Hollinger, an artist and [[illustrator]].&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;&lt;ref name=thr2/&gt;

==DVD==
[[CBS Home Entertainment|CBS DVD]] (distributed by [[Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount]]) has released all ten seasons on DVD in Regions 1, 2 &amp; 4.  Due to music licensing issues, most of the original music has been replaced on these DVD releases.&lt;ref name="Music"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/newsitem.cfm?NewsID=6373|title=Trad Mag Reports That Some Tunes Will Be Replaced|work=TVShowsonDVD.com|accessdate=September 1, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123015411/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/newsitem.cfm?NewsID=6373|archivedate=November 23, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deleted songs include "[[Damn, I Wish I Was Your Lover]]", "[[Losing My Religion]]", and "In The Mood". Starting with Season 2, some episodes are edited from their original broadcast versions.

For reasons that were never made clear, the first three season releases used promotional pictures from their succeeding seasons instead of the actual promotional pictures that were taken while the seasons aired. Due to the group pictures from the fourth season being used on the third season DVD and the absence of [[Shannen Doherty]] in later seasons, a collage of still photos was used on the fourth season. [[Jamie Walters]] was not featured on the covers of any of the seasons that he regularly appeared in (although he did appear in some of the DVD menu still shots for seasons 5 and 6).  [[Kathleen Robertson]] was only featured on the cover of the seventh season, even though she had been a regular since season 6, recurring in the entirety of season 5 and made her first appearance towards the end of season 4 (her photo was, however, used in one of the inner cases for the season 6 release).

[[Hilary Swank]] who was cast as a main star in the eighth season is featured on the cover of the DVD, even though she left halfway through her only season on the show, while [[Vincent Young (actor)|Vincent Young]], who joined the cast that same year, is not on the cover at all, or on the cover of the ninth season (he is, however, featured on the tenth season cover), but [[Lindsay Price]], [[Vanessa Marcil]] and  [[Luke Perry]] were all featured on the cover, as were [[Jason Priestley]] and [[Tiffani Thiessen|Tiffani-Amber Thiessen]] who both departed the series after a few episodes. [[Daniel Cosgrove]] was not featured on the Season 9 cover either even though he was a regular also (he is featured on the season 10 cover).

For seasons 1-8, the DVDs were packaged in individual slim plastic cases which were then housed in a large outer cardboard box. Beginning with season 9, the discs were fitted into a singular standard-sized DVD case. Initial copies came with an outer cardboard slipcase.

The ninety-minute pilot episode was released separately on June 15, 2004.

On November 5, 2013, Paramount released ''Beverly Hills 90210 - The Complete Series'' on DVD in Region 1, with extra bonuses not available on the season sets.&lt;ref name="complete"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Beverly-Hills-90210-The-Complete-Series/18811|title=Date, Cost, New Packaging, New Bonus Disc for '''The Complete Series'''|work=TVShowsOnDVD.com|accessdate=August 6, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810232453/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Beverly-Hills-90210-The-Complete-Series/18811|archivedate=August 10, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Maddox''' (1747–1822; Russian: Михаил Егорович Маддокс, ''Mikhail Yegorovich Maddox'', also spelled '' Medoks'', ''Maddocks'', ''Mattocks'') was an English entrepreneur and theatre manager active in [[Imperial Russia]].  He was co-founder, with Prince Ouroussoff, of the Petrovsky Theatre, the first permanent opera theatre in Moscow and predecessor of the [[Bolshoi Theatre]].

== Life and career ==

Described as a famous equilibrist, Michael Maddox arrived first in Russia in 1766 as the manager of a museum of 'mechanical and physical representations', visiting both [[St Petersburg]] and Moscow. Leaving Russia he travelled to [[Madrid]] with his museum, and spent time in London in the ensuing decade.  It is unclear whether he was related to Anthony Maddox, the successful slack-wire and theatre performer who drowned on a sea voyage to [[Dublin]] in 1758 along with [[Theophilus Cibber]].  There exists a possibility of confusion between the two with regard to references to [[equilibrism]].

On returning to Russia before 1776, Michael Maddox was taken into partnership in the theatre company formed that year by the Moscow Prosecutor, Prince [[Pyotr Vasilyevich Urusov| Pyotr Vasilyevich Ouroussoff]]. Maddox had had an established record of success at the [[Haymarket Theatre]], London, where it is said that in 1770 his were the most prosperous entertainments ever carried on in that house. His profits in one season are stated to have amounted to £11,000, £2,500 more than [[David Garrick]]'s a few years earlier.

Ouroussoff had been granted a ten-year licence for theatrical and other performances.  For four years they enjoyed success in a wooden theatre at [[Znamenka Street]], the [[Znamensky Theatre]], before it burnt down in early 1780.  Maddox then raised enough credit to buy his share of the company from Prince Ouroussoff and employ architect Christian Rosberg the same year to construct a new brick and stone building that faced [[Petrovka Street]].  It thus became known as the Petrovsky Theatre.  The theatre had four storeys of boxes and two spacious galleries.  The pit had two series of benches, with enclosed seats at the sides.  The sumptuously decorated boxes were available to let at from three hundred to a thousand roubles and upwards.  Admittance to the pit was one rouble.

Maddox obtained a further ten-year licence from Moscow's Governor, [[Vasily Dolgorukov (governor)|Prince Dolgoruky-Krymsky]], but financial difficulties meant that ownership of the theatre passed to the Office of Imperial Theatres in 1792.  Empress [[Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg)|Maria Feodorovna]] granted Maddox a life-long pension of 3,000 roubles for his contribution to the creation of Moscow theatre.  The theatre was operational until 1805, when it burned down just before a performance of [[Ferdinand Kauer]]'s ''[[Rusalka]]''.  It was replaced by the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] on the same site.

== Maddox Theatre Company ==

The Maddox troupe delivered 425 performances of drama, ballet and opera during this time.   These included more than 100 different operas, mainly of the comic opera/''opéra comique'' type by composers such as [[Grétry]], [[Dalayrac]], [[Mehul]], [[Paisiello]], [[Philidor]] and [[Martin y Soler]], as well as Russians such as [[Yevstigney Fomin]] and [[Vasily Pashkevich]].

The foreign operas were largely performed in Russian translations by [[Sergey Glinka]], [[Platon Levshin]], [[Ivan Dmitrievsky]], and others.  Three notable melodramas ([[Yevstigney Fomin|Fomin]]'s ''Orfeo'' and G. A. [[Jiří Antonín Benda|Benda]]'s ''Pygmalion'' and ''Medea &amp; Jason'') were part of the repertoire.
Theatre productions in Russian translation included [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo &amp; Juliet]]'' and [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Mahomet (play)|Mahomet]]''. The most successful works, however, were those of [[August von Kotzebue]], such as ''Menschenhass und Reue'', ''The Papagoy'', and ''Armuth und Edelsinn''.

Masquerades for 1,500 people or more, where carnival costume was compulsory, were held in the mirror-bedecked rotunda. This part of the structure alone had cost fifty thousand roubles to construct. [[William Tooke]] in the chapter "Sketch of Mosco" (sic) from his ''History of Russia'' describes the audience in the pit of the theatre as "perhaps, in many respects, one of the most polite that can be anywhere seen.  The ears are never rent with those noisy marks of disapprobation, which do not correct bad actors, and which distress and overpower the inexperienced and timid."&lt;ref&gt;William Tooke, ''History of Russia, from the Foundation of the Monarchy by Rurik, to the Accession of Catherine the Second'' (London: T. N. Longman and O. Rees, 1800), p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1783, Maddox also created and ran a [[Vauxhall Gardens]] enterprise concurrently in the Moscow suburbs, where operas and plays were performed from mid-May to September. A long gallery led to a grand circular hall for dancing.  From the dancing-hall there was a large area surrounded by a covered gallery, having in the middle an elevated platform for the orchestra.  This gallery was chiefly used for promenading.  Beyond this was a hall allotted to refreshments of all kinds.  On the sides were billiards rooms.  In the evenings the galleries were illuminated with coloured lamps, and on particular days fireworks displays were set off.  It is likely that Maddox and his wife retained ownership of this after the Petrovsky was taken on by the Office of Imperial Theatres.

== Miscellaneous ==

Maddox manufactured a tower clock for Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]], which is currently displayed in the [[Kremlin Armoury]] in Moscow.

He married a German woman from an aristocratic family and fathered eleven children, one of them the adventurer Roman Medoks. His wife survived him and continued with ownership of some theatrical buildings.

The suggestions that he was a Professor of Mathematics from [[Oxford University]] and that he had tutored the [[Paul I of Russia|Tsarevich Pavel]] prior to moving to Moscow have not been substantiated.

[[Alexander Chayanov]], whose wife Olga wrote a book on the history of the Maddox Theatre, set a portion of his Gothic tale "Venediktov" in the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Muireann Maguire, ''Red Spectres'' (OVERLOOK, 2013; {{ISBN|1468303481}}), pp. 68 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5426">A '''nudity clause''' is a paragraph or a section in a performer’s legal contract that stipulates which parts, if any, of the performer's body are to be exposed during a theatrical, television, cinematic, or other type of production. The clause may stipulate that a performer will not be required to perform in the [[Nudity|nude]], or it may specify that a performer is not allowed to perform in the nude. Nevertheless, a character they play may appear to be nude by the use of a "[[body double]]" in place of the performer during a [[Nudity in film|nude scene]] or the use of a flesh-colored [[bodystocking]] or a pubic area-covering [[merkin]]. Sometimes a performer will refuse to accept a role which involves nudity.

Most performing contracts stipulate which body parts may be used in the final product.&lt;ref name=globe&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/the-naked-truth-about-on-screen-nudity/article550548/ |title=The naked truth about on-screen nudity|first= Liam|last= Lacey|work=theglobeandmail.com |date=2 March 2012|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may, for example, be the back above the waist, include the buttocks, breasts, pubic hair, etc. They may also specify which parts cannot be shown - such as hands, neck, profile, etc. There are strict union guidelines around on-set nudity, which requires actors to be told of any nude scenes well in advance and nudity waivers require directors to itemize exactly what will be shown and how.&lt;ref name=globe/&gt;

At times exposure of each body part is given a commercial value and open to negotiation.&lt;ref name=globe /&gt; In 2001, [[Halle Berry]] appeared in the film ''[[Swordfish (film)|Swordfish]]'', which featured her first nude scene.&lt;ref name="Hyland"&gt;Ian Hyland (September 2, 2001). [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20010902/ai_n14532259/ "The Diary: Halle's bold glory"]. ''Sunday Mirror''. Accessed 2009-07-05.

[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1310430/Halle-Berry-earns-extra-357000-for-topless-scene.html "Halle Berry earns extra £357,000 for topless scene"]. ''The Telegraph''. Accessed 2008-04-29.&lt;/ref&gt; The brief flash of her breasts reportedly added $500,000 to her fee.&lt;ref&gt;Christa D'Souza (December 31, 2001). [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4727871/And-the-winner-is....html "And the winner is...] ''The Telegraph''. Accessed 2010-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Berry, however, denied this,&lt;ref name="Hyland"/&gt; explaining that after turning down numerous roles that required nudity, she decided to make ''Swordfish'' because her husband, [[Eric Benét]], supported her and encouraged her to take risks.&lt;ref name="ebony"&gt;"Halle's big year". (November 2002) ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
{{Original research|following paragraphs|date=October 2007}}
Especially when they are launching their careers, many female performers refuse roles that require them to perform nude, either for personal or professional reasons; companies such as Disney often go to great lengths to protect their performers' 'family friendly' image.  'No-nudity' clauses are relatively rare, in that an actress that is approached to perform such a role is usually at a stage in their career where a polite refusal is acceptable, and in most cases, body-doubles, body-stockings or other alternate options are available.{{fact|date=September 2015}}

== Studio imposition ==
Sometimes it is the studios or production companies that insist that their actresses do not take part in nude scenes or other appearances. For example, to preserve her wholesome image, [[Annette Funicello]], who was under contract with [[Walt Disney]], was not allowed to be seen in a two-piece bathing suit or show her navel in the [[beach party film]]s of the 1960s for [[American International Pictures]]; though the prohibition was not always followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Myth of the Hidden Navel|url=http://www.beachpartymoviemusic.com/TheMythoftheHiddenNavel.html|accessdate=February 20, 2012|publisher=Beachpartymoviemusic.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103012357/http://www.beachpartymoviemusic.com/themythofthehiddennavel.html|archive-date=2014-01-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== For cartoon characters ==
No-nudity clauses have also forbidden cartoon characters from appearing nude. [[Pamela Anderson]], for example, who appeared nude many times in print and in films, informed [[Reuters]] that she insisted on a no-nudity clause for her cartoon alter ego in ''[[Stripperella]]'', the adult animated series created by [[Stan Lee]].&lt;ref name="jambar"&gt;{{cite news|last=Andrews|first=Mark|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722105228/http://www.thejambar.com/news/anderson-hypocritical-with-no-nudity-clause-1.2572105|url=http://www.thejambar.com/news/anderson-hypocritical-with-no-nudity-clause-1.2572105|date=June 25, 2003|archivedate=July 22, 2012|title=Anderson hypocritical with no-nudity clause|dead-url=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The short was written and directed by Andrew Jimenez and [[Mark Andrews (filmmaker)|Mark Andrews]] and produced by [[Osnat Shurer]], head of Pixar's Shorts group. The score for the short was written by [[Michael Giacchino]]. Like many Pixar shorts, the film is completely free of dialogue and vocal effects, instead using music (played by the characters) and pantomime to tell the story. Unlike most Pixar shorts, which are solely driven by storyboarding and scriptwriting, the music in ''One Man Band'' was developed directly alongside the film's story; Giacchino collaborated extensively with the film's directors due to the large role of music in the short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pixar.com/one-man-band/#one-man-band-2 |title=One Man Band |website=pixar.com |publisher=Disney-Pixar |accessdate=May 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2006 it was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]], but lost to ''[[The Moon and the Son: An Imagined Conversation]]'' by John Canemaker and Peggy Stern. It was included in the [[Animation show of shows|Animation Show of Shows]] in 2005.

== Plot ==
Bass, a skilled and proud [[Busking|street performer]], plays a routine tune in a deserted Italian [[village]] [[town square|square]] in the afternoon, waiting for a [[pedestrian]] to tip him in his rusty iron cup. Soon, he spots Tippy, a humble peasant girl clutching a big [[gold coin]], with the intention of dropping it in the plaza [[fountain]] to make a wish. Bass, seizing the opportunity, immediately plays an [[impromptu]] piece, capturing the young girl's attention. 

Just when Tippy is about to drop the coin into Bass's cup, a newcomer steps onto the scene. Treble, a suave and flamboyant street performer, plays a more attractive song, effectively stealing Tippy's attention, much to the anger of Bass. Not to be outdone, Bass ups his ante, with Treble daring to take it even further. As the two rivals unleash their arsenal of musical weapons, trying to vie for the attention (or rather, the tip) of Tippy, the girl cowers in their wild musical cacophony, and in the process, accidentally drops her sole gold coin, which falls down a drain and gets lost in the sewers of the village.

Heartbroken, Tippy sniffles, but then angrily demands from Treble and Bass a replacement coin for the one they made her lose. When both musicians come up empty-handed, Tippy insists she take one of Treble's violins and Bass's iron cup in an attempt to get her money back by playing solo. She then tunes the violin and begins to play it like a true [[virtuoso]], prompting a passing pedestrian to drop a large bag of gold coins onto her cup. 

Elated, Tippy hugs the bag and approaches the fountain, but not before she pulls two coins out of her bag and tempts Treble and Bass. But as they eagerly reach out to grab them, she tosses the coins into the top of the fountain, out of reach, much to their dismay. A [[post-credits scene]] shows that it is now nighttime, with Treble standing on Bass, trying to reach for the coins in vain. As the two start to fall backwards, the film ends.

==Production==
Beginning development shortly after the completion of ''[[The Incredibles]]'', ''One Man Band'' was directed by Andrew Jiminez and [[Mark Andrews (filmmaker)|Mark Andrews]], who had previously worked together on films such as ''[[The Iron Giant]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]''.&lt;ref name="directors"&gt;https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Dueling-Pixar-directors-Andrew-Jimenez-and-Mark-2503098.php&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2004, they were approached by [[Ed Catmull]] and asked to visit his office; according to the duo, they were initially concerned about the implications of this, but were later relieved after Catmull requested that they begin working on a brand new short film for [[Pixar]].&lt;ref name="directors"/&gt; Jiminez and Andrews decided to create a film centered around music, a subject which they were both decidedly passionate about, and began developing a story about two musicians quarreling over the donation of a young peasant girl. The short was pitched to Pixar CEO [[John Lasseter]] and ''The Incredibles'' director [[Brad Bird]], who quickly accepted the film for production.&lt;ref name="directors"/&gt;

== Music ==
The violinists featured in the score for the film are:
* Clayton Haslop ("Treble")
* Mark Robertson ("Tippy")

The score was recorded at the Paramount Scoring Stage in Hollywood, CA. The filmmakers used a 38-piece orchestra as well as several soloists, including the ones listed above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Jessen | first=Taylor | url=http://www.awn.com/articles/coveted-five-2006-s-oscar-nominated-animated-shorts/page/2,1 | title=The Coveted Five: 2006’s Oscar-Nominated Animated Shorts | work=[[Animation World Network]] | date=February 24, 2006 | accessdate=July 31, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807225336/http://www.awn.com/articles/coveted-five-2006-s-oscar-nominated-animated-shorts/page/2%2C1 | archivedate=August 7, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music during the credits is [[Pablo de Sarasate]]'s ''[[Zigeunerweisen]]''.

The '''Ontario Film Review Board''' ({{lang-fr|Commission de contrôle cinématographique de l’Ontario}}) is an agency of the government of the [[Canadian province]] of [[government of Ontario|Ontario]] that is responsible for that province's [[motion picture rating system]]. Until recently the board reported to the [[Ministry of Consumer Services (Ontario)|Minister of Consumer Services]] but as of 1 October 2015, the board is overseen by the Ontario Film Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://news.ontario.ca/mgs/en/2015/09/new-ontario-film-authority-to-oversee-classification-and-theatres.html |title=New Ontario Film Authority to Oversee Classification and Theatres |date=30 September 2015 |accessdate=19 November 2015 |publisher=Ministry of Government and Consumer Services        }}&lt;/ref&gt; The board's activities are based on the ''[[Film Classification Act, 2005]]''.

==History==
A three-person Board of Censors was established on 27 June 1911 following passage of the ''Theatres and Cinematographs Act, 1911''. The initial members were Chair George E. Armstrong, Robert Wilson and Otter Elliott. From that point, films to be shown in Ontario legally required review and approval by the board.&lt;ref name=GM28Jun1911&gt;{{cite news | title=Moving Picture Censors Appointed / No suggestive, immoral or obscene films will be passed | publisher=''[[The Globe and Mail|The Globe]]'' | date=28 June 1911 | page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board's censorship authority included newsreels, for example footage from a 1937 General Motors strike was banned "to avoid propaganda by either side."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HC8rAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4588,2237161 | title=Hepburn Lauds Offer | publisher=''[[The Gazette (Montreal)]]'' | date=17 April 1937 | page=12 | accessdate=2010-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board of Censors began to provide basic film classifications from 1 June 1946, initially as a year-long pilot project to designate certain films which were deemed inappropriate for children. Theatre operators were required to identify such films as "adult entertainment" on marquees and advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Must State if Movies Not Fit for Children | publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]'' | date=20 May 1946 | page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Films to be marked 'for adults' June 1 | publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]'' | date=29 May 1946 | page=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Blue Dahlia]]'' and ''Her Kind of Man'' were among the first films to be identified as adult entertainment in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Movie advertisement - The Blue Dahlia | publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]'' |date=1 June 1946 | page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Movie advertisement - Her Kind of Man | publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]'' | date=5 June 1946 | page=32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further changes to the ''Theatres Act'' in 1975 empowered what was now known as the Ontario Censor Board to review and censor videotapes and [[8 mm film]] formats as well as conventional theatrical films.&lt;ref name=OFRB1988 /&gt; In the late 1970s and early 80s the Board was involved in a number of high-profile disputes with the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] (known then as the Festival of Festivals) over the Board's refusal to approve some films for screening without cuts, and for banning other films outright. In 1977, the board ordered cuts from the film ''[[Je, tu, il, elle]]'' which depicted two women having sex; the Festival pulled the film from its programme. In 1978, it demanded a 38-second cut from a love scene in ''[[In Praise of Older Women (1978 film)|In Praise of Older Women]]''; director [[Robert Lantos]] agreed but at the last minute substituted the uncut version of the film. The screening was introduced by federal [[Secretary of State for Canada]] [[John Roberts (Canadian politician)|John Roberts]] who publicly denounced the board, telling the audience at the [[Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres|Elgin Theatre]] that “because of the actions of the Ontario censor it is time for an active affirmation that censors shouldn’t tell people what they should or should not see.” In 1982, the board refused to approve [[Pierre Rissient]]’s ''[[Cinq et la peau]]''; instead of substituting another film, festival organizers protested the ban by posting a sign outside the theatre explaining why the screen was being kept dark.&lt;ref name=torontoist/&gt;

The board's high profile actions against various films being screened at the festival had the unintended effect of raising their profile and audience interest. According to former festival director Helga Stephenson, “Silly old [Ontario Censor Board chairman] Mary Brown filled some theatres with some pretty tame stuff. The ranting and raving was a very good way to get the festival into the minds of the public, but internationally it was hugely embarrassing. And it filled the theatre with the wrong people, because they came looking for nothing but blow jobs, and they found themselves in the middle of a long, hard, boring film waiting for a few seconds of a grainy image showing something that looked vaguely like a male sex organ.”&lt;ref name=torontoist&gt;http://torontoist.com/2013/09/censoring-the-toronto-international-film-festival/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the name of the board was changed  to the Ontario Film Review Board after the provincial government amended the ''Theatres Act''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Censors' rules set for films videos | first=Stephen | last=Brunt | publisher=''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' | date=5 February 1985 | page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board composition changed from full-time civil servants to part-time members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Malcolm|title=Censored! Only in Canada: The History of Film Censorship - the Scandal Off the Screen|year=1981|publisher=Virgo Press|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988 festival films became exempt from review by the board provided the audience was limited to those eighteen and over.&lt;ref&gt;http://covell.ca/ontario-film-review-board-vs-toronto-film-festival/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the original and much amended Theatres Act was replaced by the ''[[Film Classification Act]]''

In 2013 the [[Ontario Film Authority]] was incorporated. It entered into an agreement with the Minister of Consumer Services dated 5 May 2014. On 1 October 2015, an amendment to Ontario Regulation 187/09 came into effect, providing that the Ontario Film Authority is the sole administrative authority for the purpose of administering all provisions of the ''Film Classification Act, 2005'' and the regulations made under that Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://canlii.ca/t/52j7c#sec2_1 Section 2.1 of O. Reg. 187/09], as amended by [https://files.ontario.ca/gazette_docs/ontariogazette_147-47_wa.pdf O. Reg. 208/14] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119203512/https://files.ontario.ca/gazette_docs/ontariogazette_147-47_wa.pdf |date=2015-11-19 }}, as amended by [https://files.ontario.ca/gazette_docs/ontariogazette_148-16_wa.pdf O. Reg. 61/15] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119182733/https://files.ontario.ca/gazette_docs/ontariogazette_148-16_wa.pdf |date=2015-11-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This restructuring of administrative oversight in 2015 was "part of a larger provincial initiative to streamline more than 200 boards and commissions", according to ''The Toronto Star''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Toronto Star |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2015/06/04/ontario-film-review-board-wants-to-end-profiting-from-screening-porn.html |title=Ontario Film Review Board wants to end profiting from screening porn  |author=David Weisz |date=4 June 2015 |accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Censored film cases===
Significant cases have occurred where a film was either banned outright in Ontario, or certain scenes were ordered removed:

* 1926: ''[[Moana (1926 film)|Moana]]'' - the censor board would not approve this film unless 300 feet, or about 4% of the footage, was removed. The depiction of topless Samoan women in the production was cited as the cause for this censorship. The film was defended by artist [[Arthur Heming]] and others, while it was approved by film review authorities in Manitoba and Saskatchewan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Abolition of censors and box office motives figure in barring film | publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]'' | date=5 February 1926 | page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Censor has banned film which artists acclaim as wonderful picture | publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]'' | date=4 February 1926 | page=1 | first=Augustus | last=Bridle }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1940: ''[[The March of Time]]'' newsreel episode "Canada At War" was banned until the [[Canadian federal election, 1940|1940 federal election]] was completed, as Premier [[Mitchell Hepburn]] charged that the production was "pure political propaganda for the Mackenzie King Government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tIEjAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5873,5287924 | title=Night News: Ontario Bars Film Until After Election | date=4 March 1940 | page=13 | publisher=''Lewiston Evening Journal'' | author=[[Associated Press]] | accessdate=2010-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The newsreel was allowed in Quebec where cinemas in [[Hull, Quebec]] reported significant audience levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Z4cwAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3248,805630 | title=Looking Backward | publisher=''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' | date=4 March 1955 | page=41 | accessdate=2010-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1978: ''[[In Praise of Older Women (1978 film)|In Praise of Older Women]]'' - The Board requested a two-minute cut from this federally funded and Canadian made film, showing as the festival opener at the Toronto Film Festival. The cut was negotiated down to 38 seconds, but most sources claim an uncut version was shown at the festival. The offending scene was simulated sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=William|title=Film Festival Confidential|year=2005|publisher=MacArthur|location=Toronto|isbn=1-55278-523-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1978: ''[[Pretty Baby (film)|Pretty Baby]]'' - The film was fully banned from Ontario as it depicted a prostitute who was a [[Minor (law)|minor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_JxRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PG0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=ontario%20censors%20ban%20film%20on%20prostitu&amp;pg=4290%2C1313704 | title=Ontario Censors Ban Film on Prostitute, 12 | publisher=''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' | date=8 April 1978 | page=25 | accessdate=2010-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1980: ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|The Tin Drum]]'' - Specific scenes were ordered deleted before the film could be shown in Ontario. The director and distributor initially refused to edit the film but eventually agreed to a compromise where the film would be distributed with fewer cuts than originally ordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0jY0AAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1024,1792321 | title=Sin strip exceeds Tin Drum hands down | first=Catherine | last=Ford | date=4 June 1980 | publisher=''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' | page=99 | accessdate=2010-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FFwxAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6209,3326164 | title=Ontario to get 'Drum' | author=[[The Canadian Press]] | date=27 November 1980 | page=85 | publisher=''[[The Gazette (Montreal)]]'' | accessdate=2010-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2000: ''[[Baise-moi]]'' - This film originally played uncut at the Toronto Film Festival. When it was rated for general release, it was banned due to excessive explicit sexual content. The distributor resubmitted the film for consideration as an adult sex film, but it was banned due to sexual violence. Eventually the film was approved and rated R, after a small cut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Devine|first=Siobhan|title=My Tango With Porn|year=2003|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|format=Film}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2001: ''[[Fat Girl]]'' - The Film Review Board ordered deletion of scenes from most of the film's 93-minute length, effectively banning the production. Scenes of sexuality involving a 13-year-old character were cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.screendaily.com/ontario-bans-breillats-controversial-fat-girl/407513.article | title=Ontario bans Breillat's controversial Fat Girl | first=Agnes | last=Poirier | date=14 November 2001 | publisher=''[[Screen International|Screen Daily]]'' | accessdate=2010-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's distributors filed an appeal with the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]], but the Film Review Board reconsidered and passed the film intact for Ontario audiences before the appeal could be heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.screendaily.com/ontario-passes-breillats-fat-girl-uncut/4012010.article | title=Ontario passes Breillat's Fat Girl uncut | first=Agnes | last=Poirier | date=30 January 2003 | publisher=''[[Screen International|Screen Daily]]'' | accessdate=2010-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several sources claim the Board banned the NFB anti-pornography documentary ''[[Not a Love Story]].'' The Board was asked to rate this film, along with three others, submitted by a group of artists, known as the Ontario Film and Video Appreciation Society (OFVAS). The Board refused to view or rate ''Not a Love Story'' on the grounds that OFVAS did not own the film or have any distribution rights. Ratings were provided on the other films. The artists then took the Board to court over the ratings given, and the refusal to rate ''Not a Love Story.'' The Board's actions were challenged under the new [[Canadian Constitution]].

The Ontario Divisional Court ruled in 1983 that film classification and censorship were justifiable under the Constitution. The court also determined that three of the Board's rulings were valid. Approval with time and place restrictions in the case of ''The Art of Worldly Wisdom'' and ''Rameau's Nephew'' was considered a "valid exercise of the Board's power." The Board's refusal to review ''Not A Love Story: A Film About Pornography'' was acceptable as the Board did not need to perform hypothetical reviews. The film had not been submitted for commercial distribution, and the judge noted "the applicants were seeking permission to show a film they did not own and which they had no right to exhibit." Concerning the Board's ban of the fourth film, ''Amerika'', the court ruled that the Board had no legally defined rights to determine what the public could view. The government appealed to the Ontario Supreme Court, but the appeal was dismissed in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;"Ontario Film and Video Appreciation Society v. Ontario Board of Censors (1983), 41 O.R. (2d) 583, 147 D.L.R. (3d) 58, 34 C.R. (3d) 73 (Div. Ct.); affirmed (1984), 45 O.R. (2d) 80, 2 O.A.C. 388, 5 D.L.R. (4th) 766 (C.A.)"&lt;/ref&gt; The government subsequently added regulations to define the Board`s powers.

'''''Rayman Raving Rabbids 2''''' is the second installment of the ''[[Raving Rabbids]]'' party franchise, in which the [[Rabbid]]s attempt to invade Earth and have set up headquarters near a local shopping mall. Players have the option to play as a Rabbid or as [[Rayman (character)|Rayman]], who has disguised himself as a Rabbid to infiltrate their plans. The game features 54 minigames. This is the first Rayman game to have an E10+ rating by the ESRB,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/wii/action/raymanravingrabbids2/news.html?sid=6177456&amp;om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=multimodule&amp;tag=multimodule;picks;story;2|title=GC '07: Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 Multiplayer Hands-On|accessdate=2007-08-31|work=wii}}&lt;/ref&gt; a greater emphasis on simultaneous multiplayer gameplay compared to the original game, and online leaderboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consolemonster.com/newspost.php?id=0000002228|title=Ubisoft's 2007 Wii Schedule|accessdate=2007-06-19|work=Wii Monster|first=Luke|last=De'ath}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is followed by ''[[Rayman Raving Rabbids: TV Party]]''.

==Gameplay==
Minigames in Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 are played by entering a mode known as 'Trips', which is divided into five regions of the Earth: USA, Europe, Asia, South America, and Tropics. Each region has 9 minigames, 5 of which are randomly chosen each time the player begins a trip. Completing a trip unlocks those minigames, which can later be played individually through Free Play mode. Additionally, players can use a Trip Customization mode to create their own trips using the available minigames.

Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 features a wide variety of minigames that focus on different themes and use different control schemes. In rhythm music games, players use selective instruments (singing, guitar, drum, keyboard, etc.) to perform as part of a Rabbid band. Each minigame can be played with up to four players at once, as either Rabbids or Rayman.

Shooting games, which in the first Rayman Raving Rabbids were scattered among the regular levels, have now been moved to a separate area called the Shooting Arcade, where they can be played after completion of Trips. These [[first person (video games)|first-person]] [[Shoot 'em up#Tube and rail shooters|rail shooter]] games utilize real footage of locations around the world with Rabbids digitally inserted. As with other games in the Raving Rabbids series, [[plunger]]s serve a primary role as [[ammunition]].

The game has been released on the Wii and Nintendo DS. PC versions exist, but are available only in Russia, Poland &amp; China{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. In the Russian version there are only 16 mini-games. In the Poland &amp; China version there are 4 parts of 16 mini-games (4 mini-games in one part).

===Character customization===
''Raving Rabbids 2'' features an ability to create both custom [[Rayman]] outfits as well as custom [[Raving Rabbids|Rabbids]]. These outfits are often parodies or references to famous [[Film|movie]] or [[video game]] characters, including [[Indiana Jones]], [[Spider-Man]], [[Superman]], [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]], [[Sam Fisher (Splinter Cell)|Sam Fisher]], [[Ken Masters]] from [[Street Fighter]], a Mantel Trooper from the [[PlayStation 3]] game [[Haze (video game)|Haze]], [[Sailor Moon]], [[Command &amp; Conquer: Generals|Command and Conquer: Generals]], a Krusty Krew hat from the TV series [[SpongeBob SquarePants]],  [[Friday the 13th]] and the Altair costume from another Ubisoft game, [[Assassin's Creed]] that often referred by fans as "The Bunny Creed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2007/11/18/rayman_raving_rabbids_2_by_nanaki|title=Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 review.|accessdate=2007-11-18|work=Nintendo Life|first=Thomas|last=Bowskill |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071214010311/http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2007/11/18/rayman_raving_rabbids_2_by_nanaki |archivedate = December 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

===Characters===
[[Rayman (character)|Rayman]] and the [[Rayman#Raving Rabbids|Rabbid]]s return in this game.  Players take the role of Rayman in Trips mode, and have the option of playing as either Rayman or a Rabbid in Free Play mode. It is possible to unlock costumes for both Rayman and Rabbids by completing high scores in both minigames and shooting games, or by shooting a specific Rabbid in each shooting game. Occasionally, when the player beats a high score, a new Rabbid will join their party as a play-and-customizable character.

===Story===
The game starts with Rayman infiltrating a [[Shopping mall|mall]] overrun by Rabbids. As he's about to sneak in, he disguises himself wearing two socks on his head, a headband, two makeshift eyes, and inhaling [[helium]] into his [[lungs]] (in order to disguise his voice, thus blending in more with the other Rabbids). He then picks up a soda can and throws it to distract two guard Rabbids and steals one of their [[plunger]]s. Rayman climbs to the roof of the facility and peers through a skylight, where he observes the Rabbids watching a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] of everyday human life. Seconds later, one of the Rabbids jerks its head, noticing Rayman's presence. Accidentally, he falls into the mall and is spotted. A Rabbid with split color eyes (also known as Professor Barranco 3) walks up to him and [[Fourth wall|whips out a European Wii copy of the]] [[Rayman Raving Rabbids|first Raving Rabbids game]]. Taking a look at the cover, it seems to recognize Rayman. Thinking quickly, Rayman screams "BWAAAAAAAAH!", convincing the Rabbids that he is one of their own. Rayman and the Rabbids are then led into an airborne submarine, taking him to a location for invasion.

====Nintendo DS story====
The Nintendo DS version of the game features a similar storyline with a few differences. The Wii version shows how Rayman invades the Rabbids HQ in disguise, while the DS storyline explains how Rayman followed the Rabbids to Earth and learns on how the Rabbids plan to act like humans. He then decides to help the humans by following the Rabbids on each area of the world (i.e. USA, Europe, Asia, etc.) by collecting information and evidence on the Rabbids antics and behavior which he then gives the info to the humans to help prevent any more Rabbid attacks in the future at the end of story mode, which happened again, while remarking on how the Rabbids are too stupid to properly understand the world and human behavior.

==Development==

===Previews and marketing===
The original teaser trailer is a parody of the trailer for the 2007 [[Transformers (film)|Transformers]] film. As with other games in the ''Raving Rabbids'' series, [[Ubisoft]] released a number of humorous promotional videos entitled "Around the World", featuring Rabbids in a number of locations such as [[Japan]]; [[France]]; and [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]]. Featuring the music of [[Around the World (Daft Punk song)|Around the World]] by [[Daft Punk]].

''Rayman Raving Rabbids 2'' received mixed to positive reviews as well as slightly less praise in comparison to its predecessor, with a 68% [[GameRankings]] average&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamerankings.com/wii/939473-rayman-raving-rabbids-2/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; (''Rayman Raving Rabbids'' had a 76% [[GameRankings]] average).

'''Rockstar Games Toronto ULC''' (formerly '''Imagexcel''', '''GameTek Canada''' and '''Rockstar Canada Inc.'''), [[doing business as]] '''Rockstar Toronto''', is a Canadian [[video game developer]] based in [[Oakville, Ontario]]. The company was established in 1988 as Imagexcel, and became part of [[GameTek]]'s [[Alternative Reality Technology]] (ART) subsidiary in March 1995. The studio was acquired by [[Take-Two Interactive]] in July 1997, as part of ART being sold off, and became part of Take-Two Interactive's [[Rockstar Games]] label in 1999 as Rockstar Canada. In August 2002, the company was renamed Rockstar Toronto to avoid confusion with the newly-acquired [[Rockstar Vancouver]].

Rockstar Toronto has primarily been a [[porting]] house for games developed by other subsidiaries of Rockstar Games, but also developed the 2005 game ''[[The Warriors (video game)|The Warriors]]'', based on the 1979 [[The Warriors (film)|film of the same name]], and co-developed ''[[Max Payne 3]]'', as part of [[Rockstar Studios]], in 2011. Following the release of ''Max Payne 3'', Rockstar Vancouver was folded and merged into Rockstar Toronto, with the resulting company moving into new, bigger offices.

== History ==

=== As Imagexcel and GameTek Canada (1988–1999) ===
Imagexcel was founded around 1988, as a sister company to [[Gray Matter (company)|Gray Matter]]. Under that name, the company produced games such as ''[[Techno Cop]]'' (1988) and ''[[The Ultimate Ride]]'' (1990), together with Gray Matter, with their final game under the Imagexcel having been ''[[Quarantine (video game)|Quarantine]]'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/01/15/have-you-played-quarantine/ |title=Have You Played… Quarantine? |first=Alice |last=O'Connor |date=15 January 2015 |website=rockpapershotgun.com |accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/GameBytes/issue21/greviews/quaran.html |title=QUARANTINE CD-ROM from Gametek/Imagexcel |author= |date= |website=www.ibiblio.org |accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March 1995, the company was announced to have been acquired by [[Alternative Reality Technology]] (ART), a subsidiary of [[GameTek]], becoming GameTek Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/GameTek's+Alternative+Reality+Technology+division+acquires+Imagexcel,...-a016636811 |title=GameTek's Alternative Reality Technology division acquires Imagexcel, opens Canadian office. – Free Online Library |author= |date= |website=www.thefreelibrary.com |accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acquisition was completed by 7 April 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telecompaper.com/news/gametek-acquires-imagexcel-assets--53218 |title=GAMETEK ACQUIRES IMAGEXCEL ASSETS |author= |date= |website=www.telecompaper.com |accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of ART, the company developed ''[[Quarantine II: Road Warrior]]'', which was released in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/10/31/road-warrior-game/ |title=Have You Played… Quarantine II: Road Warrior? |first=Alice |last=O'Connor |date=31 October 2015 |website=rockpapershotgun.com |accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Dark Colony]]'', which was released in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-colony-review/1900-2538496/ |title=Dark Colony Review |first=Tim |last=Soete |date=19 September 1997 |website=gamespot.com |accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 July 1997, [[Take-Two Interactive]] announced that they had acquired several assets from GameTek, including ART with GameTek Canada, GameTek's European offices, and distribution rights to GameTek's ''Dark Colony'', ''[[Jeopardy! (video game)|Jeopardy!]]'' and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (video game)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gametek-assets-sold-to-take-2/1100-2467081/ |title=GameTek Assets Sold to Take 2 |first=Chris |last=Johnston |date=26 April 2000 |website=gamespot.com |accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As part of Rockstar Games (1999–present) ===
In early 1999, GameTek Canada was merged out of ART and was turned into Rockstar Canada, a new studio in Take-Two Interactive's newly-established [[Rockstar Games]] label. Although their first duties covered creating two ''[[Grand Theft Auto (video game)|Grand Theft Auto]]'' [[expansion packs]], ''[[Grand Theft Auto: London 1969|London 1969]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: London 1961|Lonson 1961]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kotaku.com/ranking-the-grand-theft-auto-games-from-worst-to-best-1791387873 |title=Ranking The Grand Theft Auto Games, From Worst To Best |first=Zack |last=Zwiezen |date= |website=kotaku.com |accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; their primary tasks later became [[Porting|ports]] of titles published by Rockstar Games to [[PlayStation 2]], that being ''[[Oni (video game)|Oni]]'' (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/25/technology/game-theory-guns-and-fists-for-hire.html |title=Guns, And Fists, for Hire |author= |date=25 January 2001 |website=The New York Times |accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'' (2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/article_30999 |title=Payne gets some consolation |first= |last=Gestalt |date=4 August 2001 |website=eurogamer.net |accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ronald McDonald''' is a [[clown]] character used as the primary [[mascot]] of the [[McDonald's]] [[fast-food restaurant]] chain. In [[television commercial]]s, the clown inhabited a fantasy world called [[McDonaldland]] and has adventures with his friends Mayor McCheese, the Hamburglar, Grimace, Birdie the Early Bird, and The Fry Kids. Since 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/69989/brief-history-mcdonaldland-and-toys-and-lawsuit-it-spawned|title=A Brief History of McDonaldland and the Toys (and Lawsuit) It Spawned|last=Bellomo|first=Mark|date=2016-10-04|work=|newspaper=[[Mental Floss]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; McDonaldland has been largely phased out, and Ronald is instead shown interacting with normal children in their everyday lives.

Many people work full-time making appearances in the Ronald McDonald costume, visiting children in hospitals and attending regular events. At its height there may have been as many as 300 full-time clowns at McDonald's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heller|first1=Karen|title=It’s the worst time in history to be a clown. They just want you to love them again.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/its-the-worst-time-in-history-to-be-a-clown-they-just-want-you-to-love-them-again/2018/03/29/ff911a62-2934-11e8-b79d-f3d931db7f68_story.html|accessdate=2 April 2018|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=30 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also [[Ronald McDonald House]]s where parents can stay overnight when visiting sick children in nearby [[chronic care]] facilities.

==History==
===Willard Scott===
The origin of Ronald McDonald involves [[Willard Scott]] (at the time, a local radio personality who also played [[Bozo the Clown]] on [[WRC-TV]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1959 until 1962), who performed using the [[moniker]] "Ronald McDonald, the Hamburger-Happy Clown" in 1963 on three separate television spots. These were the first three television ads featuring the character.&lt;ref name=heavyweights&gt;{{cite episode | url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_iz/episode/0,3195,FOOD_31138_56604,00.html | title=Big Burger Business: McDonald's and Burger King | series=Heavyweights | network=Food Network | airdate=2008-04-21 | season=2 | number=3 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012014631/http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_iz/episode/0,3195,FOOD_31138_56604,00.html | archivedate=2008-10-12 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott, who went on to become [[NBC|NBC-TV]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'' weatherman, claims to have "created Ronald McDonald" according to the following excerpt from his book ''Joy of Living'':
:At the time, [[Bozo the Clown|Bozo]] was the hottest children's show on the air. You could probably have sent [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto the Dog]] or [[Dumbo|Dumbo the Elephant]] over and it would have been equally as successful. But I was there, and I was Bozo&amp;nbsp;... There was something about the combination of [[hamburger]]s and Bozo that was irresistible to kids&amp;nbsp;... That's why when Bozo went off the air a few years later, the local McDonald's people asked me to come up with a new character to take Bozo's place. So, I sat down and created Ronald McDonald.&lt;ref name=heavyweights/&gt;

At the time, Scott was working for Oscar Goldstein, the Washington DC area McDonald's franchisee, and numerous sources describe Scott's role as only playing the part of Ronald McDonald, while giving credit for the creation of the mascot to Goldstein and his ad agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=McDonald's sends in the clown, again | website=[[USA Today]] | date=December 10, 2001 | url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2001-12-11-ronald.htm | access-date=November 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== McDonald's version ===
[[File:RonaldMcDonald-trademarkia-originaltrademark1967.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The original Ronald McDonald as pictured on the United States trademark application filed in 1967]] McDonald's does not mention [[George Voorhis]] or acknowledge that Willard Scott created Ronald in their statement:
{{quote|"The smile known around the world," Ronald McDonald is second only to Santa Claus in terms of recognition. (According to one survey, 96% of all schoolchildren in the United States of America recognize Ronald (stunning-stuff.com)). In his first television appearance in 1963, the clown was portrayed by Willard Scott.}}

On March 28, 2000, Henry Gonzalez, McDonald's Northeast Division President, thanked Scott for creating Ronald McDonald, during a taped tribute to Scott on the ''Today Show''. Yet
in 1965, Roy Burgold assigned Aye Jaye as Boss Clown worldwide in charge of hiring, writing, creating shows, media handling, training, and major events such as The White House appearances, Macy Days, etc., and finally opening Ronald worldwide for 35&amp;nbsp;years. Aye Jaye was responsible for the hiring of hundreds of past field Ronalds.

Circus performer Coco the Clown (real name [[Michael Polakovs]]) was hired in 1966 to revamp Ronald's image, and he created the now familiar costume and make-up.&lt;ref name=TimesObit&gt;{{citation |title=Michael Polakovs: Circus Clown |date=28 December 2009 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article6968955.ece |newspaper=The Times |accessdate=2 August 2010 |location=London |first=James |last=Bone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Corporate Accountability International]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] suggested Ronald McDonald should retire due to [[childhood obesity]],&lt;ref&gt;http://wbztv.com/local/ronald.mcdonald.retirement.2.1605159.html&lt;/ref&gt; however McDonald's CEO Jim Skinner said there are no plans to retire him.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=McDonald's says no way Ronald will retire |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/McDonalds-says-no-way-Ronald-apf-1794463468.html?x=0 |publisher=Yahoo! |accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, McDonald's announced that Ronald McDonald will re-appear in their commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=McDonald's Puts Ronald Back to Work |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704101604576247121216914168?mod=googlenews_wsj?x=0 |publisher=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=2 April 2011 |first=Annie |last=Gasparro |date=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Ace Metrix]] says Ronald McDonald ads are no longer effective. On May 18, 2011, Corporate Accountability International renewed their call to retire Ronald McDonald, by running ads in major newspapers and launching several web pages dedicated to the retirement of the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesunnews.com/2011/05/19/2166917/midlife-crisis-for-ronald-mcdonald.html|title=Midlife crisis for Ronald McDonald?|last=Rexrode|first=Christina|work=[[The Sun News]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=2011-05-19|accessdate=2011-05-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120912014059/http://www.thesunnews.com/2011/05/19/2166917/midlife-crisis-for-ronald-mcdonald.html|archivedate=2012-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, McDonald's CEO [[Jim Skinner]] defended Ronald McDonald by saying that he is an ambassador for good and "it's all about choice".

Various forms of the name "Ronald McDonald" as well as costume [[clown|clown face]] persona, etc. are registered trademarks of McDonald's. McDonald's trains performers to portray Ronald using identical mannerisms and costume, to contribute to the illusion that they are one character.

McDonald's marketing designers and stylists changed elements of the Ronald McDonald character, persona, style, costume, and clown face when they adopted the clown as a trademark.

==International localization==
[[File:SouthwestAsiaRonnie.jpg|thumb|right|Ronald McDonald at a military base in [[Southwest Asia]].]]

In [[Thailand]], Ronald McDonald greets people in the traditional Thai "[[Thai greeting|wai]]" greeting gesture of both hands pressed together. The Thai version of the company mascot was created in 2002 by the local Thai franchise, McThai, as part of a "McThai in the Thai Spirit" campaign. The figure has also been exported to India and other countries where a similar gesture is used.&lt;ref&gt;Rungfapaisarn, Kwanchai. "Ronald's 'wai' to hit the States." ''The Nation'' (Thailand), September 18, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In [[China]], out of respect for Ronald McDonald as an adult, children refer to him as 麦当劳叔叔 (Uncle McDonald). In [[Japan]], Ronald McDonald is called Donald McDonald due to a lack of a clear "r" sound in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[Japanese phonology|enunciation]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ronald and Donald McDonald keep their cultural identities". ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', December 17, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Licensed works==

===Film===

==Subversion==
Because of his prominence, Ronald McDonald has become a symbol not just of McDonald's but of the fast food industry in the USA as a whole,{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} as well as Corporate America, [[capitalism]], [[globalization]], and other broader topics. As such, the costume and iconography of Ronald McDonald is often appropriated by protestors and artists wishing to subvert the icon and communicate a message that runs counter to the corporate narrative. For example, in 2000, protestors in [[Hong Kong]] dressed as Ronald McDonald to protest McDonald's labor policy in [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fast Food: The Good, the Bad and the Hungry|last=Smith|first=Andrew F.|publisher=Reaktion Books Ltd|year=2016|isbn=9781780236094|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics have claimed that a clown mascot targeting children for fast food is unethical. A group of 550 doctors took out newspaper ads in 2011 demanding Ronald McDonald's retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/ronald-mcdonald-bad-kids-mcdonalds-hits-back-critics-calls-clown-ambassador-good-article-1.141877|title=Is Ronald McDonald an evil influence? McDonalds hits back at clown critics|last=Goldwert|first=Lindsay|date=2011-05-19|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2017-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Corporate Accountability International in Boston, Massachusetts suggested that Ronald McDonald should be retired due to childhood obesity in the United States; however, then McDonald's CEO Jim Skinner said there were no plans to retire the character.

On May 18, 2011, Corporate Accountability International renewed their call to retire Ronald McDonald, by running ads in major newspapers and launching several web pages dedicated to the retirement of the character. McDonald's CEO [[James A. Skinner|Jim Skinner]] defended Ronald McDonald by saying that he is an ambassador for good and "it's all about choice".

Shortly afterwards, McDonald's Website News Statements announced that Ronald McDonald is here to stay. In 2014, McDonald's new CEO Don Thompson said that Ronald McDonald does not encourage kids to eat unhealthy foods. He stated Ronald McDonald only spreads joy and smiles. The Corporate Accountability International failed to retire him due to the fact that he is a national icon and has been around for half a century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4858">[[File:Berlin Musikinstrumentenmuseum 03.jpg|thumb|250px|Entrance to the State Institute for Music Research, Berlin]]
The '''State Institute for Music Research''' ({{lang-de|Staatliches Institut für Musikforschung}} or ''SIMPK'') is a [[Musicology|musicological]] research facility in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] for the study of [[Musical Instruments]], [[Music History]], [[Music Theory]] and [[Music technology]]. It is an agency of the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]] and operates the [[Berlin Musical Instrument Museum]].

==History==
The current Institute is a direct descendant of several institutions of the former [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. In 1888, a formalized collection of ancient musical instruments was established at the Prussian Royal Academy of Music. By 1902, the collection had grown substantially through the financial support of [[Wilhelm II]].  In 1919 [[Curt Sachs]], one of the founders of the field of [[organology]] (the study of musical instruments), was appointed the first Director of the instrument collection. In 1917, an Institute for Musicological Research was also founded under the patronage of [[Prince Adolf of Schaumburg-Lippe]] in [[Bückeburg]].

At the start of the [[Third Reich]] in 1933, Sachs was dismissed and forced to emigrate by the [[Nazi Party]]. In 1935 a new National Institute for German Music Research was founded in Berlin, led by [[Max Seiffert]], incorporating the old Royal College and the [[Bückeburg]] Institute. [[World War II]] then saw the nearly complete destruction of the Institute and the Museum. In 1943, the instruments, scores and library collections were evacuated from Berlin to protect them from [[Bombing of Berlin during World War II|Allied bombing]]. Despite extensive security, the majority were lost. In January 1945, "by Decree of the Reich Minister for Science, Education and Education", the Institute was closed. At war's end, only 700 of the original 4,000 musical instruments survived.

After the war, what remained of the Institute came under the direct control of the [[West Berlin]] city government and a painstaking reconstruction began, with a focus on the valuable instruments collection. In 1949 it was given accommodations at [[Charlottenburg Palace]]. On the 200th anniversary of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s death in 1950, the Institute held the first chamber music concert on historic instruments. In 1962 the Institute came under the administration of the newly created [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]], and the Department for Musical Acoustics was established in 1965 through a grant from the [[Fritz Thyssen]] Foundation. A ceremony was held to lay the foundation stone for the Institute's current building in 1979 on the [[Kulturforum]], which opened to the public in 1984.

==Organization==

===Division I: Musical Instruments Museum ===
The [[Berlin Musical Instrument Museum]] or "MIM" collects instruments from the European [[art music]] school from the 16th to the 21st century. It holds about 3,200 instruments, of which 800 can be seen on permanent display. Those that are playable are played regularly. It is one of the most representative collections in Germany in its diversity. The museum also operates a restoration workshop and has its own concert hall with an active program of chamber concerts.

===Division II: Music Theory and Music History===
This department conducts large-scale research projects in the fields of [[Music Theory]] and [[Music History]] from antiquity to the present. It also operates the Institute's library with a special focus on [[organology]] and the [[Second Viennese School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sim.spk-berlin.de/wiener_schule_301.html The conceptual plan to edit the correspondence of the Second Viennese School]&lt;/ref&gt; It also manages the German National contribution to the [[RILM]] Abstract of Music Literature. Bibliographical work of the Institute is currently organized in the form of interactive database 
[[Bibliography of Music Literature|'''BMS ''online''''']].

===Division III: Acoustics and Music technology===
This Department researches [[Recording studio]] technology, services the Institute's Electronic equipment, and manages the full digitization its resources. One major project captures the sounds of the historic musical instruments in the Museum systematically and them develops mathematical models to describe them. Recordings from concerts at the Museum are also part of the tasks of the Department. [[Digital recording]] studio space allows it to create high-quality master CDs in-house.

{{refimprove|date=March 2017}}

"'''The Aristocrats'''" (also called "'''The Debonaires'''" or "'''The Sophisticates'''" in some tellings) is a [[taboo]]-defying [[Off-color humor|off-color joke]] that has been told by numerous [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedians]] since the [[vaudeville]] era. The joke was the subject of a 2005 documentary [[the Aristocrats (film)|film of the same name]]. It received publicity when it was used by [[Gilbert Gottfried]] during the [[New York Friars' Club|Friars' Club]] [[Roast (comedy)|roast]] of [[Hugh Hefner]] in September 2001.

==Traditional format==
This joke almost always has these elements—alternative versions may change this form.
# '''''Setup:''''' A family act going in to see a [[talent agent]]; either the whole family or just one family member (usually the father).
#*The agent asks what they do.
#*If the whole family is present, the act is performed for the agent; otherwise it is described.
#'''''Act:''''' It is described in as much detail as the teller prefers.
#*While most tellings follow one of a few basic forms, the description of the act is meant to be an [[ad lib]].
#*Traditionally, the description is tasteless and [[Ribaldry|ribald]]. The goal is to significantly transgress [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]]. Taboo acts such as [[incest]], [[rape]], [[child sexual abuse]], [[coprophilia]], [[coprophagia]], [[bestiality]], [[necrophilia]] and [[murder]] are common themes.
#'''''[[Punch line]]:''''' The shocked (or intrigued) agent asks what the act is called, and the proud answer (sometimes delivered with a flourish) is: "The Aristocrats!"; Some versions have the agent then asking, "So&amp;nbsp;– Is that all ya' got?"

==History in print==

*In 2005, [[Jackie Martling]]'s website cited "The Aristocrats" as appearing on page 987 of [[Gershon Legman]]'s ''[[Rationale of the Dirty Joke]], Second Series'', published in 1975.&lt;ref name=jokeland&gt;{{cite web | title="The Aristocrats" from ''Rationale Of The Dirty Joke, An Analysis Of Sexual Humor Series Two: No Laughing Matter'' | url = http://jokeland.com/legman.html | accessdate = 2007-03-26 | last = Martling | first = Jackie | authorlink = Jackie Martling | year = 2005 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051224085118/http://jokeland.com/legman.html | archivedate = 2005-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Legman retells the joke, complete with its traditional vaudevillian flourishes, although he does not attribute the joke to vaudeville roots. Instead, Legman learned the joke from a young man who grew up in a broken home.&lt;ref name=jokeland/&gt;
* In a 2005 interview, comedian [[Barry Cryer]] said he had heard the joke "fifty years ago".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The verdict | url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1560568,00.html | date=2005-09-02 | work=[[The Guardian]] | author=Logan, Brian |accessdate = 2007-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2010, comedian singer/songwriter Mark Silverman did a musical telling of the joke on his third album titled ''Perverse Milkman Art''.  Track number five is simply titled "The Aristocrats", and the song lyrics follow the traditional set up and punchline, but go so far as to include [[Satan]] being summoned from [[Hell]] to wage a new world war and to "rule the earth for a millennium."

If you just found the South Park kids performing the joke, and think a link should be added here then 1) see [[The Aristocrats (film)]] 2) know that the clip is from that film, not the TV show, [[South Park]] 3) please don't add it here, as we already have a link to a fairly authoritative database of versions of the joke.

in 2009 dollars. (removed - out of date) --&gt;

Reviews of the film were mixed. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] scored ''The Bank'' at 65% from 36 professional reviews (average rating 5.8/10), but 45% from 11 "top critic" reviews (average rating 5.5/10).  Australian film review site Urban Cinefile's three reviewers summarized the film as "favourable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=5225&amp;s=Reviews |publisher=Urban Cinefile |location=Australia |title=''Bank, The'' |author1=Andrew L.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''New York Times'' concluded "As far-fetched as the movie is ...  conveys an engaging zest for upper-crust mischief. The two stories come together in the hurtling final lap as Wayne confronts Simon in his country house while Jim puts his perfected program into operation. The upshot is a whopper of an ending that is as silly as it is satisfying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/25/movies/film-in-review-the-bank.html |title=Film in Review; ''The Bank' |newspaper=New York Times |first=Stephen|last=Holden |date=25 October 2002 |accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Post'' gave the film 1.5/4 stars, stating "Despite a crafty premise and a clever kink in the tale that almost saves it, Connolly isn't dexterous enough to achieve the Hitchockian level of suspense the movie needs." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Megan |last=Turne |title=''The Bank'' |newspaper=New York Post	 |date=25 October 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Los Angeles Times'' stated "Connolly might well have constructed a brisker, more exciting picture with more vivid and involving characters. As it is, the film takes too long to become truly compelling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-thomas3jan03,0,6546786.story |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030209231227/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-thomas3jan03,0,6546786.story |archivedate=2003-02-09 |date=3 January 2003 |title=Movie Review : ''The Bank'' has the chops, not the sizzle : The Australian film has a provocative premise, but it's short on color and is none too brisk. |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |first=Kevin  |last=Thomas |accessdate=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Flash''''' is an ongoing [[American comic book]] series featuring the [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] of the [[Flash (comics)|same name]]. The character's first incarnation, [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], first appeared in ''[[Flash Comics]]'' #1. When the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Flash [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] was introduced, that character took over ''Flash Comics'' numbering and the series was retitled as ''The Flash''.

Although the Flash is a mainstay in the DC Comics stable, the series has been canceled and rebooted eight times. The first series featuring Barry Allen was canceled at issue #350 in the event of the character's death in the universe altering event ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''.  When [[Wally West]] succeeded Allen as the Flash, a new series began with new numbering in June 1987. That series was briefly canceled in 2006 in the wake of the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' event, but was restarted with its original numbering in 2007, only to be canceled again in 2008 in the wake of Barry Allen's return in ''[[Final Crisis]]'' and ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]''. The series was revived for a third volume by writer [[Geoff Johns]] and artist [[Francis Manapul]] after the completion of the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event in 2010. A fourth volume was launched in 2011 as part of [[The New 52]]. A [[The Flash (2016 comic book)|fifth volume]] was launched in 2016  as part of [[DC Rebirth]].

==Publication history==

===Volume 1 (1959–1985)===

Volume 1 starred Barry Allen as the Flash and the series assumed the numbering of the original ''Flash Comics'' with issue #105 (March 1959) written by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and drawn by [[Carmine Infantino]].&lt;ref name="Irvine93"&gt;{{cite book|last=Irvine|first= Alex|authorlink = Alexander C.

The series continued the numbering from ''Flash Comics'' and gave Barry Allen his own title.  Issue #105 also debuted the Mirror Master.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comics historian [[Les Daniels]] noted that "''The Flash''" was a streamlined, modernized version of much that had gone before, but done with such care and flair that the character seemed new to a new generation of fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|title = DC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes|chapter= Flashback The Return of the Super Hero|publisher= [[Little, Brown and Company|Bulfinch Press]]|year = 1995|location= New York, New York|page= 117|isbn= 0-8212-2076-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broome and Infantino collaboration saw the introduction of several supervillains many of whom became part of the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]]. The [[Mirror Master]] first appeared in issue #105&lt;ref name="Irvine93" /&gt; and the following issue saw the debuts of [[Gorilla Grodd]] and the [[Pied Piper (comics)|Pied Piper]].&lt;ref&gt;Irvine "1950s" in Dolan, p. 94: "Two popular villains debuted in ''The Flash'' #106...'Menace of the Super-Gorilla' saw Barry Allen battle Gorilla Grodd...[and] in 'The Pied Piper of Peril', Hartley Rathaway...hired himself out to criminals as the Pied Piper and became Allen's nemesis."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Captain Boomerang]] first challenged the Flash in issue #117 (December 1960)&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie, Michael "1960s" in Dolan, p. 101: "Writer John Broome and artist Carmine Infantino kept even the Flash off-balance when they introduced George 'Digger' Harkness and his hand-held rebounding weaponry."&lt;/ref&gt; and the 64th century villain [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] was introduced in issue #128 (May 1962).&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 105: "A failed stage magician from the 64th century, Abra Kadabra debuted in this story by writer John Broome and artist Carmine Infantino."&lt;/ref&gt; Another villain from the future, [[Professor Zoom]] first appeared in issue #139 (September 1963).&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 109: "This issue saw 25th-century criminal Eobard Thawne use his era's advanced science on an old Flash costume.

[[Wally West|Kid Flash]] and the [[Elongated Man]] were respectively introduced in issues #110 and 112 as allies of the Flash.&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 100: "Editor Julius Schwartz, writer John Broome, and artist Carmine Infantino introduced the Elongated Man, a stretchable super-sleuth."&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable issues of this era was issue #123 (September 1961), which featured the story titled "[[Flash of Two Worlds]]".&lt;ref name="McAvennie103"&gt;McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 103: "This classic Silver Age story resurrected the Golden Age Flash and provided a foundation for the Multiverse from which he and the Silver Age Flash would hail."&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Allen meets his inspiration [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], after accidentally being transported to a parallel universe where Garrick existed. In this previous continuity, Garrick and the other characters of the Golden Age only existed as comics characters in the mainline shared universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Gardner Fox|Fox, Gardner]]| penciller= [[Carmine Infantino|Infantino, Carmine]]| inker= [[Joe Giella|Giella, Joe]]| story= Flash of Two Worlds!| title= The Flash| issue= 123| date= September 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; This brought about a new concept in the formative stage of what would become the [[DC Universe]], and gave birth to the current conceptualization featuring it as a [[multiverse]].&lt;ref name="McAvennie103" /&gt;

Barry Allen married his longtime love interest [[Iris West]] in issue #165 (November 1966).&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 119: "Barry Allen and iris West's wedding day...was [DC's] most anticipated...Writer John Broome and artist Carmine Infantino were the team behind the nuptials in the story 'One Bridegroom Too Many!'"&lt;/ref&gt;
Infantino's last issue was #174 (November 1967) and the next issue saw [[Ross Andru]] become the new artist of the series as well as featuring the second race between the Flash and [[Superman]], two characters known for their super-speed powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[E.

The series presented [[metafiction]]al stories featuring [[List of comics creators appearing in comics|comics creators appearing within the Flash's adventures]] such as the "Flash &amp;mdash; Fact Or Fiction" in issue #179 in which the Flash finds himself on "[[Earth Prime]]". He contacts the "one man on Earth who might believe his fantastic story and give him the money he needs. The editor of that ''Flash'' comic mag !"  Julius Schwartz helps the Flash build a [[cosmic treadmill]] so that he can return home.&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 130: "Trapped on 'Earth-Prime', the Flash knew only one man could possibly help him: DC Comics editor Julius Schwartz."&lt;/ref&gt;  Several years later, the series' longtime writer [[Cary Bates]] wrote himself into the story in issue #228.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Cary Bates|Bates, Cary]]| penciller= [[Irv Novick|Novick, Irv]]| inker= [[Tex Blaisdell|Blaisdell, Tex]]| story= The Day I Saved the Life of the Flash| title= The Flash| issue= 228| date= July–August 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four months after the cancellation of his own title, [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] began a backup feature in ''The Flash'' #217 (Aug.-Sept. 1972) and appeared in most issues through ''The Flash'' #246 (Jan. 1977) until his [[Green Lantern (comic book)|own solo series]] was revived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Greenberger|first = Robert|authorlink = Robert Greenberger|title = Green Lantern The Emerald Backups|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue = 64|pages = 3–9|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date = May 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz, who had edited the title since 1959, left the series as of issue #269 (January 1979).&lt;ref name="GCD-Schwartz"&gt;{{gcdb|type=editor|search= Julius+Schwartz|title= Julius Schwartz (editor)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Bates wrote ''The Flash'' #275 (July 1979) wherein the title character's wife, [[Iris West Allen]] was killed.&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 182: "Life for the Fastest Man Alive screeched to a halt after writer Cary Bates and artist Alex Saviuk played 'The Last Dance' for the Flash's wife, Iris West Allen."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Don Heck]] became the artist of the series with issue #280 (Dec. 1979) and drew it until #295 (March 1981).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Coates|first = John|title = Don Heck: A Work of Art|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|year = 2014|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|page = 92|isbn = 978-1605490588}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Flash'' #300 (Aug. 1981) was in the [[Dollar Comics]] format and featured a story by Bates and Infantino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Weiss|first = Brett|title = ''The Flash'' #300|journal = Back Issue!|issue = 69|pages = 58–60|publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing|date = December 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Doctor Fate]] was featured in a series of back-up stories in ''The Flash'' from #306 (Feb. 1982) to #313 (Sept. 1982) written by [[Martin Pasko]] and [[Steve Gerber]] and drawn by [[Keith Giffen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Riley|first = Shannon E.|title = A Matter of (Dr.) Fate Martin Pasko and Keith Giffen Discuss Their Magical ''Flash'' Backup Series|journal= Back Issue!|issue = 64|pages = 64–68|publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing|date = May 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major shakeup occurred in the title in the mid-1980s. The Flash inadvertently kills his wife's murderer, the [[Professor Zoom|Reverse-Flash]], in ''The Flash'' #324 (Aug. 1983).&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Matthew K. "1980s" in Dolan, p. 203: "Written by Cary Bates, with art by Flash legend Carmine Infantino, the story saw...[the Flash] accidentally break the Reverse-Flash's neck."&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to an extended storyline titled "The Trial of the Flash" in which the hero must face the repercussions of his actions. Bates became the editor as well as the writer of ''The Flash'' title during this time and oversaw it until its cancellation in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb|type=editor|search= Cary+Bates|title= Cary Bates (editor)}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Trial of the Flash" was collected in a volume of the ''[[Showcase Presents]]'' series in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bates| first = Cary| title = Showcase Presents: Trial of the Flash| publisher = DC Comics| year = 2011| pages = 592| isbn = 1-4012-3182-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before Barry Allen's death in ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the series was cancelled with issue #350 (October 1985). In the final issue of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', [[Wally West]], previously known as Allen's sidekick Kid Flash, stated his intent to take up his uncle's mantle as the Flash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|penciller= [[George Pérez|Pérez, George]]|inker= [[Jerry Ordway|Ordway, Jerry]]|story= Final Crisis|title= [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]|issue= 12| date= March 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume 2 (1987–2006, 2007–2008)===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Wallyflash1.png|thumb|left|170px|Cover for ''Flash'' vol. 2 #1 (June 1987). Art by [[Jackson Guice]] and Larry Mahlstedt.]] --&gt;
Featuring [[Wally West]] as the main character, the Flash mostly operated out of [[Keystone City]]. The second series was launched by writer [[Mike Baron]] and artist [[Jackson Guice]] in June 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 228: "Written by Mike Baron, with art by Jackson Guice, the Flash's new adventures began with his twentieth birthday party."&lt;/ref&gt; Featuring long runs most notably by writers [[Mark Waid]] and [[Geoff Johns]], the second volume originally went in a different direction from the series starring Barry Allen by making Wally West more flawed. This Flash could not constantly maintain his super-speed because of his [[hypermetabolism]], and would consume gargantuan amounts of food in order to continue operating at top speed. This metabolic limitation would later be continued into Barry Allen's character for the brief television series ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]'' broadcast in 1990-91, as well as ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' series which debuted in 2014, though to a lesser degree.

Mark Waid's tenure on the title in the 1990s brought back more traditional Flash aspects from Barry Allen's era by reforming the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]], some of which were new incarnations of old characters, and bringing more of a sci-fi/fantasy aspect that had been lost in Flash titles since Allen's departure. Waid made Wally West much more powerful in an attempt to take him out of Barry Allen and Jay Garrick's shadows. Waid and artist [[Mike Wieringo]] introduced [[Bart Allen|Impulse]] in issue #92 (July 1994).&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 265: "The brainchild of writer Mark Waid and artist Mike Wieringo, Impulse burst onto the scene at quite a pace.  Young Bart Allen, the grandson of the Silver Age Flash, Barry Allen, was raised in a future timeline."&lt;/ref&gt; Wally West married [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]] in issue #142 (October 1998).&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 285: "Wally West was going to marry his longtime love interest Linda Park...thanks to writers Mark Waid and Brian Augustyn, and artist Pop Mhan."&lt;/ref&gt;

When writer [[Geoff Johns]] stepped aboard with issue #164 (September 2000), he refocused the character on some of the Silver Age aspects by spending single issues on building the psychology of the various Rogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]| penciller= [[Angel Unzueta|Unzueta, Angel]]|inker= [[Doug Hazlewood|Hazlewood, Doug]]|story= Lightning in a Bottle| title= The Flash|volume= 2|issue= 164|date= September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Johns, Geoff| penciller= [[Peter Snejbjerg|Snejbjerg, Peter]]| inker= Snejbjerg, Peter|story= Rogue Profile: Heat Wave|title= The Flash|volume= 2|issue= 218|date= March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johns created [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]], the third of the [[Reverse-Flash]]es, and fleshed out the environmental character of Keystone City in an attempt to make it unique in comparison to other fictional DC cities such as [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] or [[Gotham City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Johns, Geoff|penciller= [[Scott Kolins|Kolins, Scott]]|inker= Hazlewood, Doug| story= Rogue Profile: Zoom|title= The Flash|volume= 2|issue= 197| date= June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the "[[One Year Later]]" event and Wally West's disappearance in ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', DC canceled ''The Flash'' vol. 2 with issue #230 (March 2006) in favor of a new series starring [[Bart Allen]] as the Flash. The new series, titled ''The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'', ran only 13 issues and ended with Bart's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Marc Guggenheim|Guggenheim, Marc]]|penciller= [[Tony Daniel|Daniel, Tony]]| inker= [[Jonathan Glapion|Glapion, Jonathan]]; [[Marlo Alquiza|Alquiza, Marlo]]; Daniel, Tony|story= Full Throttle: Conclusion|title= The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive|issue= 13| date= August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Waid returned to the title briefly in 2007 with the series resuming with #231 to bring about the return of Wally West but the series was canceled again at issue #247 in late 2008 with the return of Barry Allen in the event series ''[[Final Crisis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Alan Burnett|Burnett, Alan]]| penciller= [[Carlo Barberi|Barberi, Carlo]]; [[Jim Calafiore|Calafiore, Jim]]; [[Andre Coelho|Coelho, Andre]]

In 2010, DC Comics announced that after the completion of ''The Flash: Rebirth'' and ''Blackest Night'', Geoff Johns would return to writing a new ''Flash'' ongoing series with artist [[Francis Manapul]].&lt;ref name="source"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2009/09/08/the-dastardly-death-of-the-rogues|title= The Dastardly Death of the Rogues!|first= Alex|last= Segura|date= September 8, 2009|work= The Source|publisher= DC Comics|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6AssTkCQ2|archivedate= September 22, 2012|deadurl= |accessdate= September 22, 2012|quote= Writer Geoff Johns would be writing a new ongoing ''Flash'' series?

It was followed one week later with the release of ''The Flash'' vol. 3 #1. On June 1, 2011, it was announced that all series taking place within the shared [[DC Universe]] would be either canceled or relaunched with new #1 issues, after a new continuity was created in the wake of the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' event. ''The Flash'' was no exception, and the first issue of the new series was released on September 2011.

===Volume 4 (2011–2016)===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, DC Comics relaunched ''The Flash'' with issue #1, with writing and art handled by [[Francis Manapul]] and Brian Buccellato.&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb series|id= 61181|title= The Flash ''vol. 4'}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with all of the titles associated with the DC relaunch, Barry Allen appears to be about five years younger than the previous incarnation of the character. Superheroes at large have appeared only in the past five years, and are viewed with at best, suspicion, and at worst, outright hostility. In this new continuity, Barry's marriage to Iris West never took place, and he is instead in a relationship with longtime co-worker [[Patty Spivot]]. In this new series, the Flash draws deeper into the Speed Force, enhancing his mental abilities while still trying to get a full grasp on his powers, which he doesn't yet exert total control over.

As revealed in issue #0 of this series, Barry Allen's father was placed in prison for the murder of his mother. While the evidence seems to indicate his father's guilt, Barry makes proving his father's innocence a priority. The murder occurred shortly after Barry returned victorious from a school spelling bee, and Barry placed the trophy he won on his mother's grave in her memory. Barry is also part of the main cast of the relaunched ''Justice League'' series, making his debut in the series' second issue.

Writers [[Robert Venditti]] and [[Van Jensen]] and artist [[Brett Booth]] became the new creative team on ''The Flash'' as of issue #30 (June 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2014/01/13/the-flash-comic-book-series-tv/4357593/|title= The Flash speeds into a big breakout year in 2014|first= Brian|last= Truitt|date= January 13, 2014|work= [[USA Today]]|archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6dZA1JiLk|archivedate= December 6, 2015|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume 5 (2016–present)===
During [[DC Rebirth]], Barry is no longer the only Flash. It is revealed that Wally West has been lost in the Speed Force for ten years, realizing during this time that Barry is not responsible of changing the timeline after the Flashpoint crisis, the unknown entity used Barry's time travelling as an opportunity to fundamentally alter reality. The fallout of the recent Darkseid War allowed Wally to try and reach out to his former friends in the hopes of either returning or warning them of the truth, but each attempt caused him to fall further into the Speed Force. After realizing not even Linda (his traditional "lightning rod") could remember him, Wally sank into desolation and chose to appear before Barry one last time to thank him for the life he had given him. Just before Wally disappeared, Barry remembered him and dragged him free of the Speed Force. Following a tearful reunion, Wally gave Barry his warning of the true source of the universal change and the dangers to come. Because of Wally, Barry is now aware that the timeline is not reset correctly after Flashpoint and thus another alternate timeline. However, he still cannot remember his pre-Flashpoint life, such as people like Jay Garrick and the details of his feuds with the Reverse-Flash / Eobard Thawne (who now remembers their pre-Flashpoint history), and remembers Wally from their new DC Rebirth timeline history. Despite being informed by Wally that another party is responsible, Barry remains in guilt over his mistakes, and seeks to find and stop them in hopes of making amends.Although the two decide to keep Wally's return secret from Iris based on Wally's own experience with Linda, Barry encourages him to return to the Teen Titans, but also recommends that he don a new costume to reflect that he is the Flash rather than 'Kid Flash'. While Wally considers his options, Barry visits Batman to discuss the new evidence of some outside force attacking them, musing on how personal this assault appears, but despite the potential danger, Batman and Barry agree to keep their investigation to themselves until they know what they are up against.

'''''The Iron Man''''' is a 1930 [[animated]] film which was directed by [[John Foster (cartoonist)|John Foster]] and Harry Bailey.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=CROC - Cartoons and Stories for Kids|title=The Iron Man {{!}} Aesop's Fables {{!}} Classic Cartoons for Kids|date=2018-05-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiG3opPs74M&amp;t=0s&amp;list=LLZEvCl9KAuwYAPJ03uaA77g&amp;index=2|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced by [[The Van Beuren Corporation]], and released by [[Pathé|Pathe]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a film distributor which had the newsreel [[Pathe News]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=British Pathé|title=Pathe News Titles (1962)|date=2014-04-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVrqnJYsQzk|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stcuthbertshouse.com/videos-and-media/pathe-news|title=Pathe News|last=Sage|first=Dave|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The film was also part of the early sound cartoon series entitled ''[[Aesop's Sound Fables]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, although the film is part of that-said series, the film is actually not based on a fable written by [[Aesop]]. Another abnormality with this film is that although it was released in 1930,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=M7vwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=good+old+schooldays+1930&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkvIXDqOXbAhXML8AKHfGgCgQQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20iron%20man&amp;f=false|title=The First Hollywood Sound Shorts, 1926–1931|last=Bradley|first=Edwin M.|date=2009-04-27|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476606842|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the copyright notice on the actual film reads in roman numerals [[MCMXXIX]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which translates to 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://roman-numerals.info/MCMXXIX|title=Roman Numerals: MCMXXIX = 1929|website=Roman Numerals|language=en|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

]]
The film begins with a male cat walking down the street singing and playing a [[musicbox]]. He then descends onto a neighborhood. He plays there until [[Farmer Al Falfa]], a recurring character in the Aesop series, looks out of his window, and describes the music as "rotten". He then gets out of his house, and asks the cat to leave. He compiles, by running off the screen. The farmer, then chases a pair of chickens, who were there when the cat first descended onto the neighborhood. They then fly up onto a [[branch]] of a [[tree]]. Once up there, one chicken lays an [[egg]] and flings it at the farmer. The farmer, for retaliation, acquires a [[saw]], and climbs up the tree, nearly falling off it whilst climbing. Once at the same level as the chickens, he brings out his saw and begins to cut. As soon as they realise that the farmer is cutting off an individual branch, which would make the farmer fall off the tree. The chickens retreat to the trunk of the tree. However, the tree branch comically stays standing, whilst the rest of the tree collapses. The farmer then descends from the branch to the ground. However, the branch hits him and the animals, who were watching the ordeal, starts to laugh at him. The farmer then returns home. Once he is back home and sitting on the stair leading to his front door, the postal service arrives with a [[Mail#Other mail services|package]] which is delivered via a [[horse drawn carriage]]. That package is an machine, an iron man. Once the farmer opens up the package. The robot starts to dance, with the farmer following along. During the dance, the robot kicks the farmer. So, in retaliation, the farmer kicks the robot back. This causes the robot to malfunction, by gradually increasing in size, until it is bigger than the [[Earth]]. The robot then explodes. The farmer then laughs at the animals. Until, the debris comically falls from space and reassembles the robot. Both the farmer and the animals run from the robot in the closing shot of the cartoon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The film ends with a moral, which is portrayed with a duck and a sleeping Milton Mouse, the only time he is featured in this cartoon. The duck states that, "An oyster is a fish dressed up like a nut". The duck's statement wakes up the sleeping mouse. The duck then tugs at the mouse's [[fishing pole]], mistaking Milton that he has caught a fish. Milton proceeds to pull at the pole, which results in him falling off the duck and into the water. The film ends with the duck laughing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Characters ==
This cartoon, unlike other ''Aesop Sound Fables'' at that time, does not features Rita Mouse and features Milton Mouse only once. Milton is featured in the moral which is at the end of the cartoon. Instead, another recurring character entitled Farmer Al Falfa is featured in this cartoon, portrayed as the main character, he unexpectedly receives the iron man via post. Other characters in the film are a variety of species of animals, and the iron-man, who chases after all the characters at the end of the cartoon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Reception ==
The film gathered positive reviews from the film magazines at that time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/motionpic41moti|title=Motion Picture News (Jan - Mar 1930)|last=Motion Picture News|first=|date=1930|publisher=New York, Motion Picture News|others=New York The Museum of Modern Art Library|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Motion Picture Hearld, September 19, 1931&lt;/ref&gt; The Motion Picture News said that the film has "nearly everything needed in a short of pen-and-ink variety", and also said the film's music created "many laughs when tied up to the antics to the cartoon characters". The magazine's closing comment is that "A good slapstick, or a short dramatic number will go along well with this."

It was followed by the 2008 sequel ''[[The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor]]''.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE 400-700 WORDS. --&gt;
In 3067 BC, the [[List of characters in The Mummy series#Mathayus (The Scorpion King)|Scorpion King]] leads his army on a campaign to conquer the known world. Seven years later, his army is defeated while attacking [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and exiled to the desert of Ahm Shere, where his men die of heat exhaustion. After vowing to give [[Anubis]] his soul for the power to defeat his enemies, an [[oasis]] forms to hide the Scorpion King's [[pyramid]] and he receives a legion of jackal warriors. The Army of Anubis sweeps across Egypt, but once their task is finished, Anubis claims the Scorpion King's soul and his army.

In 1933, Rick and Evelyn O'Connell explore a ruined mortuary temple in ancient Thebes with their son, Alexander, where they find the Bracelet of Anubis. In London, the bracelet locks onto Alex, showing him a vision directing him to Ahm Shere. Alex has seven days to reach the oasis before the bracelet will kill him when the sun's rays shine on the Scorpion King's pyramid.

Evelyn is captured by an Egyptian cult who resurrect [[Imhotep (character)|Imhotep]]; they wish to use his power to defeat the Scorpion King, giving him command of Anubis's army to take over the world. The cult, led by Baltus Hafez, the [[British Museum]]'s [[curator]], includes a warrior named Lock-Nah and Meela Nais, the latter being a reincarnation of Imhotep's lover [[Anck-su-namun]]. Rick sets out to rescue Evelyn, accompanied by her brother Jonathan and the [[Medjay|Medjai]] Ardeth Bay.

Hafez attempts to sacrifice Evelyn but a fight ensues between Rick and Imhotep. Imhotep awakens mummified soldiers to kill Rick and the others. Freeing Evelyn, they flee on a double-decker bus. Alex is kidnapped by Lock-Nah, and along with the cult travels to Egypt. The O'Connells pursue along with Rick's associate from past adventures, Izzy, a pilot who provides the group with transportation.

The bracelet gives Alex directions to Ahm Shere and they travel there by train. Alex leaves clues for his parents, who follow in Izzy's [[dirigible]]. Imhotep uses the Book of the Dead to give Meela Nais the soul of Anck-su-namun, but inadvertently allows Evelyn to recover her memories of her previous life as Princess Nefertiri, the bracelet's keeper and [[Pharaoh]] [[Seti I]]'s daughter. Lock-Nah finds Alex leaving clues, so Imhotep makes a wall of water that attacks the dirigible, causing the O'Connells to crash into the jungle of Ahm Shere. Izzy stays with the dirigible to repair it. The O'Connells attack the cult, and both groups are attacked by pygmy mummies. Rick retrieves Alex while Ardeth Bay kills Lock-Nah. They escape the pygmies, who kill the cult except for Baltus, Imhotep and Anck-su-namun.

Rick and Alex make it to the pyramid before sunrise, where the bracelet detaches from Alex's arm. Ardeth regroups with the Medjai in case Anubis's army rises. Evelyn is mortally stabbed by Anck-su-namun. Baltus puts the bracelet on and revives the Army of Anubis. Imhotep's powers are taken by Anubis, forcing him to fight as a mortal. Rick finds Imhotep summoning the Scorpion King and fights him, but the Scorpion King interrupts them, and Imhotep claims that Rick intends to kill him. The Medjai battle Anubis's army of jackal warriors. While Rick and the Scorpion King fight, Baltus is killed. Jonathan and Alex steal the Book of the Dead from Anck-su-namun and use it to resurrect Evelyn, who confronts Anck-su-namun while Alex and Jonathan help Rick.

The scepter Jonathan has been carrying extends into a spear that can kill the Scorpion King. The Medjai defeat Anubis' army, but find they have only defeated the vanguard. Rick sends the Scorpion King and his army back to the Underworld by killing the Scorpion King with the spear of Osiris, causing the oasis to be sucked back into the pyramid. Rick and Imhotep hang above a pit that leads to the underworld. Evelyn risks her own life to save Rick, but Anck-su-namun abandons Imhotep, who chooses to fall to his death after witnessing his lover's betrayal. Anck-su-namun falls into a pit of [[scorpion]]s and is eaten alive. The O'Connells reach the top of the sinking pyramid, and Izzy arrives with a modified dirigible and rescues the O'Connells as the oasis and the pyramid disappear. They depart into the sunset.

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 47% based on 140 reviews with an average rating of 5.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "In ''The Mummy Returns'', the special effects are impressive, but the characters seem secondary to the computer generated imagery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mummy_returns/ |title=The Mummy Returns |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 48 out of 100 based on 31 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref name="metac"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/mummyreturns |title=The Mummy Returns |publisher=[[Metacritic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A-" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt; {{cite web |url=https://www.cinemascore.com/publicsearch/ajax/title/bXVtbXkgcmV0dXJucw== |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]], who awarded the first film three stars, gave the second film only two, saying that "The mistake of ''The Mummy Returns'' is to abandon the characters, and to use the plot only as a clothesline for special effects and action sequences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20010504/REVIEWS/105040304/1023 |title=Review |author=Roger Ebert |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] of ReelViews gave the film two and a half stars (out of four), calling it "hollow, lightweight entertainment—not unpleasant, but far from the summer's definitive action/adventure flick."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/m/mummy2.html |title=Review |author=James Berardinelli |publisher=ReelViews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth Turan of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' gave the film a positive review, praising its "constant plot turns, cheeky sensibility and omnipresent action sequences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/top/1,1419,L-LATimes-Movies-X!ArticleDetail-31481,00.html?search_area=Movies&amp;channel=Movies |title=Review |author=Kenneth Turan |publisher=Los Angeles Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020602133316/http://www.calendarlive.com/top/1,1419,L-LATimes-Movies-X!ArticleDetail-31481,00.html?search_area=Movies&amp;channel=Movies |archivedate=2002-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd McCarthy of [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] praised "the nonstop action of the final hour", saying that it "bursts with visual goodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=review&amp;reviewid=VE1117797948&amp;categoryid=31&amp;query=%22The+Mummy+Returns%22 |title=Review |author=Todd McCarthy |publisher=Variety | date=May 3, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joe Morgenstern of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' gave the film a negative review, saying that it "has all of the clank but none of the swank of the previous version."&lt;ref name="metac"/&gt; Charles Taylor of [[Salon.com]] was also not impressed, calling ''The Mummy Returns'' "everything the first ''Mummy'' was fun for not being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://salon.com/ent/movies/review/2001/05/04/mummy_returns/index.html |title=Review |author=Charles Taylor |publisher=Salon.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726114149/http://www.salon.com/ent/movies/review/2001/05/04/mummy_returns/index.html |archivedate=2008-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[animal husbandry]] and [[animal fancy]], animals can compete in various shows and sports for '''titles''' signifying excellence. These titles vary depending on the species of the animal, the kind of show, and the country the event is held in.

==Dogs==

===Conformation Shows===
Dogs competing in [[conformation show]]s are eligible to win two titles. The first is [[best of breed]], which signifies that a given animal is the best of its breed at the show. These best of breed winners then compete to win [[Conformation show|best in show]]. Animals that win enough best of breeds and best of shows are called ''Champions'', and their [[show name]]s are prefixed with Ch., such as [[Warren Remedy|Ch. Warren Remedy]].

===Dog Sports===
Dogs competing in a variety of [[dog sports]] are eligible to earn a number of titles. Often the first, or basic tile, signifies that a given animal has displayed a competent level and capable of proceeding in a given discipline. The next title is often incremented by class, level or a [[Championship (dog)|Champion]], proceeded by a [[Championship (dog)|Grand Champion]] title, in that particular activity.&lt;ref name=UKCtitles&gt;{{cite web|title=What titles can you earn at UKC?|url=http://www.ukcdogs.com/Web.nsf/WebPages/DogEvents/TitleAbbreviations|publisher=[[United Kennel Club]]|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dog's [[Breed registry#Registered names and naming traditions|registered names]] is then appended or prefixed with the title earned. This varies with the [[Breed registry|registry]] or sanctioning body that the title was awarded under. Both prefixed and appended titles are represented in [[Morghem's .500 Nitro Express]]'s fully titled name [[Lure coursing|CA]]&lt;ref name=UKCtitles /&gt; [[Weight pulling|UWP]]&lt;ref name=UKCtitles /&gt; [[Rally obedience|URO1]]&lt;ref name=UKCtitles /&gt; [[Championship (dog)|CH]]&lt;ref name=UKCtitles /&gt; [[Dock jumping|USJ]]&lt;ref name=UKCtitles /&gt; [[Purebred dog|'PR']] [[Morghem's .500 Nitro Express]] [[Canine Good Citizen|CGC]]&lt;ref name=CGCtitle&gt;{{cite web|title=CGC As a Title|url=https://www.akc.org/dog-owners/training/canine-good-citizen/title/|publisher=[[American Kennel Club]]|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; TT.

The '''Udukku''', also known as ''Udukkai'',({{Lang-ta|உடுக்கை}}) ({{Lang-ml|ഉടുക്ക്}}) , is an Indian traditional percussion instrument of [[Dravidian peoples|dravidian]] origin, once popular in [[Tamil Nadu]] [[Kerala]],  and north and east parts of [[Sri Lanka]], similar to [[Damaru]] and [[Edakka]], larger than the former but smaller than the latter.

Udukku is a smaller version of [[Edakka]], shaped like an hour glass.&lt;ref name="Milapfest"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.milapfest.com/instruments-india/explore-instruments/the-udukkai/ | title=Milapfest | publisher=Milapfest | date=2014 | accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is about 8 to 10 inches long with a girth of 6 to 8 inches on both ends and tapering towards the centre.&lt;ref name="Nathalaya"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nathalaya.co.uk/instruments/percussion/udukku | title=Nathalaya | publisher=Nathalaya | date=2014 | accessdate=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="India 9"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.india9.com/i9show/Udukku-66020.htm | title=India 9 | publisher=India 9 | date=2014 | accessdate=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body of the instrument is traditionally made out of kiln fired clay but later variants are made of wood, preferebly from a single hollow block of Jackfruit wood. Brass bodies are also used in some parts.&lt;ref name="Milapfest" /&gt; The ends of the instrument is covered across the mouth with cured and dried animal hide, goat skin is the preferred leather. Hoops are placed on the edge of the instrument body and the skin is tightened using strings woven from end to end.&lt;ref name="Milapfest" /&gt; Udukku is played on one side and the non playing side is provided with one or two metallic wire snares, enabling the player to generate more resonance. A strap made of cloth is fixed to the middle of the instrument  for clasping it. Coloured balls made of cotton strings are also placed hanging from the instrument as an embellishment.&lt;ref name="Nathalaya" /&gt;

Udukku is commonly played as the percussion accompaniment in temple rituals or in folk culture.&lt;ref name="India 9" /&gt; The ''Ayyappan Pattu'' performed at [[Sabarimala]] temple in Kerala to propitiate [[Lord Ayyappa]], uses Udukku as the percussion accompaniment&lt;ref name="Udukku Chandai"&gt;{{cite AV media | url=https://www.amazon.com/Udukku-Chandai/dp/B0019TRPAY | title=Ayyappan Arputhangal | publisher=Geethanjali | date=2006 | medium=Music album | ASIN=B0019TRPAY}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is often called ''Udukku Pattu''.&lt;ref name="India Video"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indiavideo.org/kerala/arts/ritual-art-forms/ayyappan-paattu-74.php | title=India Video | publisher=India Video | date=2014 | accessdate=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Udukku Kotti Pattu'', is a traditional art form of Kerala where the vocal rendition of the song is accompanied by the Udukku rhythms.&lt;ref name="Chendamelam"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chendamelam.net/udukkupattu.html | title=Chendamelam | publisher=Chendamelam | date=2014 | accessdate=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Udukku Kotti Pattu"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://traditionsinkerala.blogspot.ae/2014/01/udukku-kotti-pattu-folk-song.html | title=Udukku Kotti Pattu | publisher=Traditions in Kerala | date=17 January 2014 | accessdate=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that Udukku was popular in [[Jafna]], Sri Lanka even during the 9th century AD.&lt;ref name="Google Book"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k9DpMY206bMC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;dq=Udukku+musical+instrument&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5_jTDM_P41&amp;sig=r2NnfRH5We8nBqOi1i2LhE8r2t0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z41rVK4Midc8mviBkAM&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Udukku%20musical%20instrument&amp;f=false | title=Ancient Jaffna: Being a Research Into the History of Jaffna from Very Early Times to the Portug[u]ese Period | publisher=Asian Educational Services | author=C.

== Playing style ==
Udukku is played holding it horizontally, only on one side, generally the right side, while the left hand is used to clasp the instrument with the cloth strap.&lt;ref name="India 9" /&gt; The fingers, mainly index, middle and ring fingers, along with the inner palm are used for playing and the cloth strap is squeezed or released to adjust the tightness of the leather to attain pitch modulation.&lt;ref name="India 9"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.india9.com/i9show/Udukku-66020.htm | title=India 9 | publisher=India 9 | date=2014 | accessdate=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fingers of the left hand are also used to adjust the tightness by pulling the strings directly.&lt;ref name="Nathalaya" /&gt;

'''Vacanţa Mare''', or '''The Great Holiday''' (referring to the [[summer break]]), is a [[Romania]]n [[humour]] group. The group was established in 1988 by [[Dan Sava]], [[Mugur Mihăescu]] and [[Radu Pietreanu]]. In 2007 the group is formed by Mihăescu, Pietreanu and [[Florin Petrescu|Florin ''Axinte'' Petrescu]], but also includes some co-workers: [[Iulian Ilinca|Iulian ''Frankfurt'' Ilinca]], [[Emil Rădinoiu|Emil ''Mitică'' Rădinoiu]], [[Mirela Stoian|Mirela ''Lila'' Stoian]] and [[George Robu|George ''Romică'' Robu]].

==The beginnings==

Vacanţa Mare was formed as a student hobby group in the late 1980s. At first the group was made up by five, but it was not very popular. After two members left the group, Vacanţa Mare started to have shows by the seaside, especially during the summer holidays. In 1992, at a non-professional stand-up comedy contest, the group came in second for the "Burduful de Aur" award, where they were spotted by talent hunter Nicu Dragosin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sibianulonline.ro/articol/ziar/sibiu/primele-zile-din-vacanta-mare/8353/ Sibianul nr. 97/5 decembrie 2005 - Primele zile din Vacanţa Mare]&lt;/ref&gt; He determined them to continue their stand-up comedy acts (they wanted to give up their routine at that point), while transforming them from amateurs into a professional group. Their first motto was ''Noi nu suntem normali'' (literally "We're not normal").

The group became famous and began staging 4 tours yearly: two national tours in spring and autumn and two at the seaside and sometimes in [[Bucharest]]. The three used to do parodies of songs, changing the lyrics and replacing them with political events sung alongside a guitar. The group made a signature entrance on stage, with a soundtrack based on "[[The Final Countdown (song)|The Final Countdown]]" by [[Europe (band)|Europe]]. Furthermore, their exit was always done on a remix of [[Floare de Iris]] of the [[Iris (Romanian band)|Iris]] band and on the [[Folk music|folk]] song [[Ţăranul e pe câmp]] (known in English as "The Farmer In The Town"), the spectators being invited to sing along. The show consisted from a series of 5-10 [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] and stand-up routines, 5–10 minutes each, followed by 5–30 minutes of song remixes playing satirizing a political or cultural event. Many of the sketches featured common Romanian regional or cultural stereotypes (such as the stupid policemen in Garcea, the stereotypical countryside fools, always drunk and fighting each other in Leana and Costel, or the not-so-successful thieves in Crapu and Menumorut).

==TV shows==

After Dan Sava's death in 1999, the two remaining members continued to activate, in the autumn of 1999 the group started a weekly show on [[Pro TV]]. The shows had a running time of one hour, being aired at prime-time (8 PM). The rival TV station [[Antena 1 (Romania)|Antena 1]] responded with a similar show from [[Divertis]], a remarkably similar group, that inspired the formation of Vacanța Mare in the late 80s. The show format consisted of two parts - half an hour of comedic sketches such as ''Râdeţi cu oameni ca noi'', ("Laugh with the likes of us"), ''Spectacol Vacanţa Mare'', ("The Vacanţa Mare Show") and ''Stăpânii [[Manele]]lor'', ("The Masters of [[Manele]]" - a pun on ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' translated in Romanian as ''Stăpânul Inelelor''). This part of the show is somewhat similar to [[BBC]]'s [[Little Britain]] show. The second half of the show it was reserved to a theatrical comedic series (''Leana and Costel''), featuring the life of their famous characters in the village of [[Sadova, Dolj]].

A few years in the collaboration with [[Pro TV]], the show started to lose audience, being moved to a later time segment (10 PM). However, the group made two movies: [[Garcea si oltenii]] (2001) and [[Trei fraţi de belea]] (2006). Both movies where heavily promoted by [[Media Pro Pictures]], a subsidiary of the company that also owns [[Pro TV]], and "Garcea și oltenii" grossed the highest box office figures for a Romanian movie after 1989 (almost 290.000 spectators viewed the movie in [[Romania]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=5201&amp;art=12475&amp;cHash=e62626f651 Cotidianul, 9 mai 2006 - Filmele româneşti au prins gustul promovării]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 2007 the group left [[Pro TV]] for [[Kanal D]] for a salary of 300.000[[Euro|€]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kanald.ro/emisiuni_em5.html Kanal D - Vacanţa Mare - Garcea reloaded]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==

*''The professor and his assistant'' - they were the main characters in their first comedy series "Pastila timpului" ("The time pill") which was the second half of their original PRO-TV show from 1999. The 2 characters would travel to a different time period every episode, get into trouble and barely escape using the "Time pill".
*''Garcea'' - the stereotypical image of the Romanian traffic [[policeman]], slow, stupid (he is barely literate) and always threatening people with his [[Baton (law enforcement)|baton]] or with his ticket book.
*''Leana and Costel'' - a peasant couple from [[Sadova, Dolj]]. Stereotypical rural idiots, with a stereotypical [[Oltenia]] accent, always drinking [[ţuică]] and fighting each other, they get themselves in all kinds of troubles while trying different [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s. Other well-known characters from the "Leana and Costel" series are their stupid fat son Axinte, their mentally slow and horny daughter Lila, their greedy neighbor Mitică, the inn-keeper Romică and Frankfurt, a local gypsy.
*''Boier Moflea si Voda'' - "Moflea the Noble and the King", an ironic image of a king in medieval Romania and a member of the aristocracy. They would often debate and find ridiculous solutions to several problems of the kingdom. Moflea had a trademark upper-lip. Another well-known character of the series was Gheorghe the Peasant, who represented a satire of the medieval Romanian peasant.
*''Crapu and Menumorut'' - two fairly idiotic thieves, of [[Fictional representations of Romani people|gypsy]] ethnicity, performing robberies with varying degrees of (in)success around the world.
*''Istvan Kopefalagyi "Pisti" '' - an ironic image of a member of the Hungarian minority in Romania. He would always complain that he was being mistreated.

==Cultural Influence==

The group had an important influence amongst the Romanian public - a traffic policeman is commonly referred to as "Garcea", while some of their tag lines became common phrases in the urban vocabulary (such as ''iezista o esplicatie'' - a grammatically incorrect form of ''există o explicație'' - "There is an explanation" for a stereotypical explanation).
Also, a Hungarian is commonly referred to as "Pishty", a [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] character played by Mugur.

'''Warkop''' (an abbreviation of '''War'''ung '''Kop'''i, meaning "coffee stall") were an [[Indonesia]]n comedy troupe that enjoyed success in radio, films and television over the 1980s and 1990s. Assembled in [[Jakarta]] on 1976 under [[Prambors FM|Prambors]] management, they initially went by the name Warkop Prambors. They soon burgeoned as the country's top comedy group, surpassing [[Srimulat]] and [[Jakarta Group]]. After their film debut, they settled on the name Warkop DKI (taken from the initials of the three main members: Dono, Kasino and Indro; and also a play on Jakarta's official name, Jakarta DKI).

==Early career==
In the mid-1970s, Warkop joined Prambors for the ''Obrolan Santai di Warung Kopi'' weekly radio comedy program. The program featured Dono as Slamet; Kasino as Mas Bei, Acong and Buyung; Indro as Mastowi and Ubai; Nanu as Tulo; and Rudy as Mr. James and Bang Cholil. An appearance in ''Terminal Musikal'', directed by Mus Mualim, boosted Warkop's reputation as a comedy group.

==Personnel==
The members are [[Wahjoe Sardono]], [[Kasino Hadiwibowo]], [[Indrodjojo Kusumonegoro]], [[Nanu Mulyono]], and [[Rudy Badil]]. They are [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and university graduates. Dono, Kasino and Nanu were students at [[University of Indonesia]] and Indro was a student at [[Pancasila University]]. Their student background prompted them to incorporate social criticism into their comedy. The only surviving member of the core trio is Indro, after Kasino died from a brain tumor in 1997 and Dono died from lung cancer in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guess what?: Indro feels presence of Dono and Kasino|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/07/14/guess-what-indro-feels-presence-dono-and-kasino.html|accessdate=22 April 2018|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Filmography ==
Warkop produced most of their work over 1979 - 1994, starring in 34 comedy films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ini daftar lengkap 34 film Warkop DKI, legendaris|url=https://www.brilio.net/creator/daftar-lengkap-34-film-warkop-dki-030621.html|accessdate=22 April 2018|publisher=brilio.net|date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
