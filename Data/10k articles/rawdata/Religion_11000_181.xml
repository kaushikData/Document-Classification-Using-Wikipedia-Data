'''Amrutanubhav''' or '''Amritanubhav''' is a composition by the [[Marathi people|Marathi]] saint and poet [[Jñāneśvar]] during the 13th century. It is considered to be a milestone in [[Marathi literature]].
[[File:Sant Jñāneśvar.jpg|thumb|Statue of Shri Jñāneśvar (Gnyaneshvar)|left]]
==Etymology of the name==
Amrutanubhav is composed of  two [[Marathi language|Marathi]] words ''Amrut'' (derived from [[Amrita]] which translates as immortal [[Elixir]] in [[Sanskrit]]) and ''Anubhav'' meaning experience. As a result, it literally translates to "The elixir of experience" or even "the experience of elixir" in [[Sanskrit]]/ [[Marathi language|Marathi]].

==About the work==
On advise from his [[guru]], [[Nivruttinath]],&lt;ref name="hindupedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Sant_Dnyaneshwar |title=Sant Dnyaneshwar |publisher=hindupedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jñāneśvar created an original work to state his experiences in [[yoga]] and [[philosophy]]. Although the work did not achieve as much fame as the ''Jñāneśvari'', it is still considered as one of the most important ones in [[Marathi literature]]. This work was to be Dnyaneshwar's last as he soon announced his intention to take on the state of a ''Sanjeevan [[Samadhi]]''.&lt;ref name="hindupedia"/&gt;

The '''Assemblies Jehovah Shammah''' are an [[Evangelical]] Christian network of churches that originated in [[India]], which is still home to the great majority of them. The Evangelical publication [[Operation World]] estimates their numbers, as of 2010, at 310,000 adults and children in 910 assemblies,&lt;ref name="Mandryk 2010 408"&gt;{{citation|first=Jason |last=Mandryk|title= Operation World |publisher=Biblica Publishing|year=2010|page = 408}}&lt;/ref&gt; as their churches are generally known. Other sources estimate upwards of two thousand congregations, with a large presence in the [[States of India|State]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclopaedia.de/wiki/Assemblies_(Jehova_Shammah) |title=Assemblies (Jehovah Shammah)|accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was founded in 1942 by [[Evangelism|evangelist]] [[Bakht Singh]], whose theology and ecclesiology were much influenced by the [[Open Brethren]]. Although historically distinct from the [[Indian Brethren]] movement, which originated from missionary endeavours, the Assemblies Jehovah Shammah have a lot in common with it and are sometimes (but not always) considered a part of the Brethren movement worldwide.

==Theology and Ecclesiology==
Theologically, the Assemblies Jehovah Shammah are a conservative Evangelical movement placing a great emphasis on the preaching and expounding of scripture. They are a lay movement with no ordained clergy, and each congregation is led by elders who take responsibility for the spiritual needs of those in fellowship. Assemblies Jehovah Shammah do not have a formal membership, but regard any Christian who has been [[Believer's baptism|baptised as a believer]] and attends regularly as being part of their fellowship.&lt;ref name="mosesonmissions.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mosesonmissions.wordpress.com/2007/12/08/bakht-singh-church-planting-philosophy/|title=Bakht Singh : Church Planting Philosophy|accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Holy Communion]] is celebrated weekly as part of a largely informal worship service, with any believer in the congregation who feels "moved by the [[Holy Spirit]]" offering prayers, sharing scriptures, or suggesting hymns. This period of free worship is followed by an hour-long sermon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=W3sGM-wp1msC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=%22Bakht+Singh%22+%2B+%22Brethren%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SHMZf1Rkeg&amp;sig=pzFeLUvqwbRz7tyUJLGb5m5RZZU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=k85eVbenIsLk8AWYr4KQAQ&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bakht%20Singh%22%20%2B%20%22Brethren%22&amp;f=false|title=Quest for Identity|accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these matters, the Assemblies Jehovah Shammah greatly resemble the [[Open Brethren]], but with certain adaptations to [[Indian culture]], such as seating the congregation on mats on the floor. Unlike much of the wider Brethren movement, however, the Assemblies Jehovah Shammah have never restricted women from participating audibly in worship;&lt;ref name="mosesonmissions.wordpress.com"/&gt; until the last two decades, the great majority of Brethren assemblies around the world had a policy of reserving the "vocal" roles in worship to men only. Much (though not all) of the [[Indian Brethren]] movement remains very conservative and resistant to the changes that have occurred in some parts of the Brethren world in the last generation. This is one of the lines of demarcation between the Assemblies Jehovah Shammah and the older Indian Brethren movement.

Although the Assemblies Jehovah Shammah developed independently of the Indian Brethren movement, the many similarities between the two movements mean that the Assemblies Jehovah Shammah is often considered part of the Brethren movement worldwide. It is categorized as such by the [[World Christian Encyclopedia]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} Indian Brethren theologian and historian [[Thottukadavil Eapen Koshy]] also regards them as such,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books/about/Brother_Bakht_Singh_of_India.html?id=hpGZGwAACAAJ&amp;hl=en|title=Brother Bakht Singh of India|accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did the late [[Scotland|Scottish]] Brethren missionary, [[Daniel Smith (evangelist)|Daniel Smith]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} In [[Pakistan]], unlike India, the Assemblies Jehovah Shammah operate under the "Brethren" label and there is no line of demarcation between them and the older, missionary-founded, Brethren movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naushadngul.blogspot.co.nz/2013/03/bakht-sing.html|title=Bakht Singh : Ministry in Pakistan|accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who regard the Assemblies Jehovah Shammah as "Brethren" generally categorize them as [[Open Brethren]], in view of their willingness to work and worship together with Christians of other denominations. Their highly centralized leadership, however, is not typical of Open Brethren, for whom complete congregational autonomy is paramount, and may be more similar to the "connectional" model known among the [[Exclusive Brethren]]. Although Bakht Singh taught congregational autonomy,&lt;ref name="mosesonmissions.wordpress.com"/&gt; in practice he maintained tight centralized control over the movement until his death in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sternfieldthoughts.blogspot.co.nz/2009/04/bakht-singh-1903-2000-indias-billy.html|title=India's Billy Graham|accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If counted as part of the wider Open Brethren movement, the Assemblies Jehovah Shammah comprise some forty percent of all Brethren in India, and fifteen to twenty percent of all Brethren worldwide.

===The Charismatic Movement===
Although [[Bakht Singh]] believed in praying for [[divine healing]] and some people attributed supernatural healings to his prayers,&lt;ref name="mosesonmissions.wordpress.com"/&gt;  he was a [[cessationist]] and opposed to the [[Pentecostal]] and [[Charismatic movement|Charismatic]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=XGiv3riaunQC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=%22Bakht+Singh%22+%2B+%22anti-Pentecostal%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=46GeOpfRJ_&amp;sig=b-YYljw4ZlJP2d0_OL7j1umB_io&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HOdeVaGvE42i8AW-nIGQAQ&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bakht%20Singh%22%20%2B%20%22anti-Pentecostal%22&amp;f=false|title=The South Indian Pentecostal Movement in the Twentieth Century|accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the so-called [[Gifts of the Holy Spirit|sign gifts]], such as [[miracle]]s, [[divine healing]], and [[speaking in tongues]] were given to the early church for the specific purpose of authenticating the [[apostles]], and "ceased" with the death of the last apostle. If people were healed in response to his own prayers, he believed that was a sovereign act of God, not attributable to any "gift" of his.&lt;ref name="facebook.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?id=181594428543771&amp;story_fbid=484234058279805|title=Messages by the Late Brother Bakht Singh, India|accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Assemblies Jehovah Shammah have, however, embraced the Charismatic movement since his time.&lt;ref name="facebook.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=H0lRIryhX3EC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=%22Bakht+Singh%22+%2B+%22Pentecostal%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JekiNrAC71&amp;sig=dSdJSRNPQaKMTwfl9PctDpxmBEU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=geNeVeD1J8vo8AXKyIC4Ag&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bakht%20Singh%22%20%2B%20%22Pentecostal%22&amp;f=false|title=Cities: Missions' New Frontier|accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assemblies Jehovah Shammah Worldwide==
The Assemblies Jehovah Shammah form a significant part of the Brethren movement in [[Pakistan]], where Bakht Singh began preaching while it was still a part of [[British India]]. The movement has spread outside of the [[Indian subcontinent]] through [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian emigration]]. Some congregations may now be found in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchesinaustralia.org/suggested-churches/ |title=Suggested Churches|accessdate=2015-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10152">'''Badimo''' ([[Tswana language|Tswana]] ''[[wikt:badimo|badimo]]'', literally "ancestors") is a name for the indigenous [[African Traditional Religion]] of [[Botswana]]. Although the [[CIA Factbook]] states that six percent of [[Botswana]]s are practitioners, in reality a great majority of Botswana follow at least some of the traditions deemed ''Badimo'' even if they are strong followers of another religion as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Consuming a Colonial Cultural Bomb'' :Translating Badimo Into 'Demons' in the Setswana Bible (Matthew 8.28-34; 15.22; 10.8) [http://jnt.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/21/73/33 Journal for the Study of the New Testament]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Badimo", although usually translated as "ancestors" does not simply refer to people who are now dead, but rather to the "living dead". In the traditional African worldview, deceased ancestors continue to be present and are actively included in the daily life of individuals and tribes.

==Origin==
Badimo originated from Batswapong ancestors and put in the [[Tswapong Hills|hills of Tswapong]]. They are invisible and only heard by children and older people. They speak their own language and make violent wind sounds whenever they move. They aid people in health and can determine whether are not a person remains healthy or not with their presence. There were many cases of young boys were kidnapped and returned, knowing the full Badimo language. These children are chosen to deal with the Badimo when the join future delegations. There were traditional ceremonies and rituals held every year before the first rains to thank the ancestors for the good yields of the past year. During these rituals, Bajalwa (traditional beer) is brewed and a beast is killed, cooked, and taken to the hills where the Badimo are hidden. The delegation would leave this food and come back later to discuss with the Badimo and collect the utensils. The delegation would tell the Badimo what the community felt about their lives. If the Badimo were satisfied, they would tell the delegation what their expectations were for the community.  
The Badimo also serve the purpose of notifying the next of kin about a death or if someone is dying.&lt;ref&gt; "''Badimo in the Tswapong Hills'' - ProQuest" [https://search.proquest.com/openview/e128743e6f79bad3b495558dd5e86fe1/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=1817635 Badimo in the Tswapong Hills] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious Diversity==
Badimo, among other traditional religions, is mixed in with the most dominant religion in Botswana, [[Christianity]].  Only a small percentage of Botswanans practices pure Christianity. Majority of Botswanans practice a form of Christianity that is influenced and mixes with traditional religious customs. It makes the religion equal to be a social and cultural aspect of their society.&lt;ref&gt; "''Botswana Society &amp; Culture Complete Report: An All-Inclusive Profile Combining All of Our Society and Culture Reports''" [http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/arcadia/detail.action?docID=535653 Botswana Society &amp; Culture Complete Report: An All-Inclusive Profile Combining All of Our Society and Culture Reports] &lt;/ref&gt;
With past population estimates made in 2014, there are approximately 2.2 million people in Botswana. Of that, there is estimated 63 percent identifying as Christian, 27 percent as "God", 8 percent as no religion, and 2 percent as the traditional indigenous Badimo. The majority having a dual religious practice, Christianity and traditional religious worship.&lt;ref&gt; "''Botswana - Religion''" [https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/botswana/religion.htm Botswana - Religion] &lt;/ref&gt; While the Botswanan people met missionaries with open arms and were convinced to join this new religion at the time in a welcoming and comforting way it did not stop them from creating their own version of the new religion. For them, as a society, their religion was not only a way of life but a reflection of who they are as a people. To drop the traditional practices would mean they would give up their identity. Since they were on good terms with the new religion, it allowed them to integrate their social identity and customs to not only customize the religion but make it their own.&lt;ref&gt; ''Written On Our Hearts: Tswana Christians and the 'Word of God' in the Mid-Nineteenth Century'' [http://ezproxy.arcadia.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=asn&amp;AN=31738579&amp;site=ehost-live Written On Our Hearts: Tswana Christians and the 'Word of God' in the Mid-Nineteenth Century] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
In most traditional religions and even modern religions, health, and faith are complimentary. This religious identity allows for a reduction in risk of HIV as well as calling for a need for further research in the field. Those who follow a religion are encouraging to practice premarital [[abstinence]] and marital fidelity as a way of [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] prevention. There is a mentality, behind the larger groups of believers, following such safe practices that there is a societal decrease of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref&gt; ''Religion, identity and public health in Botswana''  [http://ezproxy.arcadia.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=asn&amp;AN=31579566&amp;site=ehost-live Religion, identity and public health in Botswana]  &lt;/ref&gt; Botswana midwives practice a traditional form of delivering babies. They continuously use traditional herbs and rely heavily on worship. Religious practitioners and church healers also have the status to diagnose misfortune and physical ailments.&lt;ref&gt; ''Traditional midwives in Botswana. | POPLINE.org'' [https://www.popline.org/node/425539 Traditional midwives in Botswana. | POPLINE.org] &lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of traditional or modern belief, citizens, including traditional midwives, doctors, and healers, all use modern medicine and technology if illnesses or other health issues seem too complicated to handle. “Traditional religious specialists may bring rain, diagnose misfortunes, or strengthen households against evil influences and witchcraft, using herbs, roots, and special medicines”&lt;ref&gt;''Culture of Botswana - history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family'' [http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Botswana.html] &lt;/ref&gt; Dingaka is a traditional doctor that have extensive knowledge of medicinal herbs and plants. No modern medicines can match the medicinal herbs used by Dingakas for centuries to heal and cure diseases. Dingakas also claim to have powers, such as: ordering lightning to strike people and fixing unsteady marriages. Those who wish to practice must register with the Botswana Dingaka Association.&lt;ref&gt; ''Botswana - Religion'' [https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/botswana/religion.htm] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Chiefs in the pre-colonial time willingly passed along their powers. This created a societal effect in terms of structure and culture. Following this was the Botswanan mentality of accepting help and finding resources beyond their traditional parameters. It explains why in health and religion why the people in Botswana are mostly open and receptive to outside help, which was not the case for many other societies at the time.&lt;ref&gt; ''Understanding Chieftainship in Botswana: The Status and Powers of Chiefs in Present Day Botswana'' [http://ezproxy.arcadia.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=asn&amp;AN=109325723&amp;site=ehost-live Understanding Chieftainship in Botswana: The Status and Powers of Chiefs in Present Day Botswana] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Values==
Before colonial missionaries, Botswanans worshipped Modimo, a Supreme Being. The believed that a being was responsible for creating humankind, animals, and nature. Their cosmology reflected a strong connection between people and the natural environment. One of the most important values held by Botswanans is Botho. Botho means highest respect, honor, and esteem that one holds for another human life. Members of the society are required to practice Botho. Other values in Botswanan society include democracy, development, self-reliance, and unity. There is also a strong value in Morero (consultations), to ensure peace in society. This process is at inter-personal, family, and community levels, where communities and government consult at the Kgotla.&lt;ref&gt; ''Botswana - Religion'' [https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/botswana/religion.htm] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Most Botswanans believe in a heaven, hell, and resurrection in a Christian context. People expect the dead to keep interest in their descendants, as ancestral spirits. People prefer to be buried in their home villages, even if they have not lived there for a long time. Funerals are very important and expensive events.&lt;ref&gt; ''Culture of Botswana - history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family'' [http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Botswana.html] &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bandhaji''' is a historic [[Tirtha (Jainism)|Jain tirtha]] about 35&amp;nbsp;km from [[Tikamgarh]].&lt;ref&gt;Jain Tirth Yatra Darshak, Br. Gevilalji, Pub. Mulchand Kishandas Kapadia, II ed, 2015, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bharat Ke Digambar Jain Tirth, Pt. 3, Balbhadra Jain, Bharatvarshiya Digambar Jain Tirthkshetra Committee, Bharatiya Janapitha, 1976, p. 127-130&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The 900 years old black colored idol of principal deity Bhagwan [[Ajitnatha]] is installed in a basement of Shri Bandhaji Atishaya Kshetra. According to historical and archeological evidences available this Kshetra seems to be more than 1500 years old.

The 7 Bhonyare (Basements) are quite famous in ‘Bundelkhand’ which are situated in ‘Pava’, ‘Deogarh’, ‘Seron’, ‘Karguvan’, ‘Bandha’, ‘Papora’ &amp; ‘Thuvon’. It is said that these seven Basements were constructed by two brothers namely ‘Devpat’ and ‘Khevpat’. The two ancient spired temples are also constructed here which are worth seeing from the point of view of art and magnificence.&lt;ref&gt;Bharat Ke Digambar Jain Tirth, Pt. 3, Balbhadra Jain, Bharatvarshiya Digambar Jain Tirthkshetra Committee, Bharatiya Janapitha, 1976, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

This Kshetra is quite wealthy from the point of view of archeology. The important matter related to Jainism is scattered anywhere in fields, pounds, ancient forts and in old temples. 
It seems that this place was developed during the time of Chandel Kings and Bhonyare (Basement) constructed during the time of Muslim rulers (to keep idols safely).

==Main Temple &amp; Idol==


At Atishaya Kshetra Bandhaji, the idol of principal deity Bhagwan Ajitnath is installed in ancient Bhonyara. It was created &amp; reverenced in 1142 (Samvat 1199). It is black colored 2 and half feet high Padmasana idol. On both sides of this idol 2 feet high [[Kayotsarga]] idols of Bhagwan Adinath and Bhagwan Sambhavnath are installed respectively. These both idols were reverenced in 1152 (Samvat 1209). The other idols of Bhagwan Adinath, Sambhavnath &amp; Neminath are also installed here. 
The huge spired temple is built near Bhonyara and it is 65 feet high. This temple was constructed in dense forest. Built in 18th century, this temple is quite artistic. There is one small temple near the spired temple. The small temple was possibly a ‘Math’ in ancient times and later it was converted into small temple. Like ‘Gandhkuti’ it is quite artistic. There are 12 doors in this altar and ‘Dharmachakra’ is created in center of this temple.

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]] and [[Roman mythology|myth]], '''Caca''' is the sister of [[Cacus]], the son of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] who stole cattle from [[Hercules]] during the course of his [[Labours of Hercules|western labors]]. Caca betrays her brother by revealing the location of the cattle to Hercules, who had in turn stolen the cattle from [[Geryon]]. 

According to [[Lactantius]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Lactantius]], ''Divine Institutes'' 1.20.36: "There is also the cult of Caca, who told Hercules his cattle had been stolen: she achieved divinity by betraying her brother" ''(colitur et Caca, quae Herculi fecit indicium de furto boum, diuinitatem consecuta, quia prodidit fratrem)'', English translation by Anthony Bowen and Peter Garnsey, ''Lactantius: Divine Institutes'' (Liverpool University Press, 2003), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Servius]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053%3Abook%3D8%3Acommline%3D190 8.190]: "His own sister, who had the same name, betrayed him: hence she earned a shrine in which sacrifices were made to her through the agency of the Vestal Virgins" ''(hunc soror sua eiusdem nominis prodidit: unde etiam sacellum meruit, in quo ei per virgines Vestae sacrificabatur)''.&lt;/ref&gt; she was cultivated as a deity in recognition of her service to the [[deity|god]]. 

In his conceptual approach to [[List of Roman deities|Roman deity]], Michael Lipka gives Cacus/Caca as one of the examples of divine pairs differentiated by gender but bound by kinship, as [[Libera (mythology)|Libera]] was the sister of [[Liber]] and [[Fauna (goddess)|Fauna]] the daughter, sister, or wife of [[Faunus]]. Lipka suggests that these deities did not come into existence as pairs, but developed to provide complementary gender balance within their sphere of influence, in this case cattle-raising. 

Despite the lateness of the only ancient sources that mention her, Caca is probably an older Roman goddess. Servius says she had a ''[[sacellum]]'' (shrine), probably located in Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lipka, ''Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach'' (Brill, 2009), pp. 141–142, citing also Jocelyn Penny Small, ''Cacus and Marsyas in Etrusco-Roman Legend'' (Princeton University Press, 1982), pp. 32–34.&lt;/ref&gt; where sacrifices were made to her through the agency of the [[Vestals]]. She has thus been seen as a sort of "proto-[[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]]", a fire goddess sharing in her brother's Vulcan-inherited capacity for fire-breathing.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Marinčič, "Roman Archaeology in Vergil's Arcadia (Vergil ''Eclogue'' 4; ''Aeneid'' 8; Livy 1.7)," in ''Clio and the Poets: Augustan Poetry and the Traditions of Ancient Historiography'' (Brill, 2002), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl Friedrich [[Freiherr]] von Weizsäcker''' (28 June 1912&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 28 April 2007) was a German [[physicist]] and [[philosopher]]. He was the longest-living member of the team which performed nuclear research in Germany during the [[Second World War]], under [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s leadership. There is ongoing debate as to whether or not he and the other members of the team actively and willingly pursued the development of a nuclear bomb for Germany during this time.

A member of the prominent [[Weizsäcker family]], he was son of the diplomat [[Ernst von Weizsäcker]], elder brother of the former [[President of Germany|German President]] [[Richard von Weizsäcker]], father of the physicist and environmental researcher [[Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker]] and father-in-law of the former General Secretary of the [[World Council of Churches]], [[Konrad Raiser]].

Weizsäcker made important theoretical discoveries regarding energy production in stars from [[nuclear fusion]] processes. He also did influential theoretical work on planetary formation in the early [[Solar System]].

In his late career, he focused more on philosophical and ethical issues, and was awarded several international honors for his work in those areas.

==Background==
Born in [[Kiel]], [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]], he was the grandson of [[Karl Hugo von Weizsäcker]], the Prime Minister of the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]]. His grandfather was ennobled in 1897 and raised to the hereditary nobility with the title of Baron (Freiherr) in 1916. As such, the four-year-old Carl Friedrich Weizsäcker became Baron Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. Since 1919, noble titles have legally been considered parts of the family name.

Weizsäcker was raised in [[Stuttgart]], [[Basel]] and [[Copenhagen]]. Between 1929 and 1933 Weizsäcker studied [[physics]], [[mathematics]] and [[astronomy]] in Berlin, [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] and [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]], supervised by and working with Heisenberg and [[Niels Bohr]], among others. The supervisor of his [[doctoral thesis]] was [[Friedrich Hund]].

==Work on nuclear fusion in the Sun==
Weizsäcker's special interests as a young researcher were the nuclear processes in stars and the [[binding energy]] of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]]. Together with [[Hans Bethe]] he found a mechanism or pathway for the cyclic process of [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] in stars ([[Bethe–Weizsäcker process]], published 1937-1939).&lt;ref&gt;C.F. von Weizsäcker (1937) "Über Elementumwandlungen im Innern der Sterne. I" (On transformations of elements in the interiors of stars. I), ''Physikalische Zeitschrift'' (Physics Journal), vol. 38, pages 176-191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.F. von Weizsäcker (1938) "Über Elementumwandlungen im Innern der Sterne. II" (On transformations of elements in the interiors of stars. II), ''Physikalische Zeitschrift'', vol. 39, pages 633-646.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hans A. Bethe (1939) "Energy production in stars", ''Physical Review'', vol. 55, pages 434-456.&lt;/ref&gt; This discovery should not be confused with his later development of the [[Semi-empirical mass formula|Bethe–Weizsäcker formula]], or Semi-Empirical Mass Formula (SEMF), which was a theoretical formula relating the curve of [[nuclear binding energy]], nuclear masses, and certain other nuclear properties.&lt;ref&gt;''Zur Theorie der Kernmassen'' (''On the theory of nuclear masses''); in: Zeitschrift für Physik (Journal of Physics) '''96''' (1935) pages 431-458&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work on planetary formation==
In 1938, Weizsäcker developed a theory on the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|formation of the Solar System]], based on considerations regarding the unequal share of lighter and heavier [[Chemical element|element]]s in the [[Sun]] and the [[Solar System]]'s [[terrestrial planet]]s. His views were later generally acknowledged and refined by a large number of other physicists and astronomers. According to the theory, the Sun and its [[planet]]s evolved from a gas cloud made up of 99% [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]], and 1% of heavier elements. Some 10% of the cloud remained around the Sun as an extensive [[atmosphere]] during an initial phase, and the 1% of heavier elements within this 10% of the total mass of the cloud would tally with the fraction of roughly 1% that the planets contribute to the mass of the Solar System today.

The theory also helped to explain the empirically observed regular pattern of increase in the diameters of the [[orbit]]s of the planets of the Solar System, from inward to outward. This result was a natural outcome of the increasing size of "planetary eddies" of gas and dust farther from the centre of the early solar system.

A further implication of his theory was that many [[star]]s out in the universe, with characteristics similar to the Sun, would have to be expected to possess [[planetary system]]s similar to our own.&lt;ref&gt;[[Heinz Haber]]: ''Unser blauer Planet'' [Our blue planet] (1965; in German); "Die Entstehung der Erde" [The formation of the Earth], Rororo pocket edition at [[Rowohlt Verlag|Rowohlt]], Reinbek near Hamburg 1967, pp. 19-23&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after [[V-E Day|the end of the Second World War in Europe]], the Russian emigre American physicist [[George Gamow]] co-authored an influential paper supporting Weizsäcker's work on planetary formation in the early solar system.&lt;ref name=Gamow&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gamow|first=G.|author2=Hynek, J.

==Work on atomic weapons==
After [[nuclear fission]] became known in early 1939 through the work of [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Lise Meitner]], Weizsäcker (and by his own estimate, 200 other physicists) quickly recognised that [[nuclear weapon]]s could potentially be built. He discussed the upsetting implications in February 1939 with philosopher friend [[Georg Picht]].&lt;ref name=Weiz77&gt;{{cite book | last= von Weizsäcker | first= Carl Friedrich | authorlink= Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker | year= 1977 | title= Der Garten des Menschlichen. Beiträge zur geschichtlichen Anthropologie | language= German |trans-title=The garden of the human ones. Contributions to historical anthropology | chapter= Selbstdarstellung (Self-manifestation) | page=568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War, Weizsäcker joined the [[German nuclear energy project]], participating in efforts to construct an [[atomic bomb]]. As early as August 1939, [[Albert Einstein]] warned U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] about this research and highlighted that "the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von Weizsäcker, is attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Berlin where some of the American work on uranium is now being repeated."&lt;ref&gt;[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/Einstein-Roosevelt-letter.png Einstein's letter to Roosevelt, 2 August 1939]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a protégé of [[Werner Heisenberg]], Weizsäcker was present at a crucial meeting at the Army Ordnance headquarters in Berlin on 17 September 1939, at which the German atomic weapons program was launched.&lt;ref&gt;John Cornwell, ''Hitler's Scientists'' (Viking 2003), 232&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the war — possibly until 1942 — he hoped a successful nuclear weapons project would earn him political influence.&lt;ref name=Bezeichnung2&gt;[http://www.nbi.dk/NBA/release.html www.nbi.dk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207042450/http://www.nbi.dk/NBA/release.html |date=2007-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1940 he was co-author of a report to the army on the possibility of "energy production" from refined [[uranium]]. The report also predicted the possibility of using [[plutonium]] for the same purpose including the production of a new type of explosives.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, ''Hitler's Scientists, 235&lt;/ref&gt; During summer 1942 Weizsäcker filed a patent on a transportable "process to generate energy and neutrons by an explosion... e.g. a bomb". The patent application was found in the 1990s in [[Moscow]].

Historians have been divided as to whether Heisenberg and his team were sincerely trying to construct a nuclear weapon, or whether their failure reflected a desire not to succeed because they did not want the Nazi regime to have such a weapon. This latter view, largely based on postwar interviews with Heisenberg and Weizsäcker, was put forward by [[Robert Jungk]] in his 1957 book ''Brighter Than a Thousand Suns''. In a 1957 interview with the German weekly ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', Weizsäcker frankly admitted to the scientific ambitions of those years "We wanted to know if chain reactions were possible. No matter what we would end up doing with our knowledge&amp;nbsp;– we wanted to know."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Der Spiegel]]'', "...und führe uns nicht in Versuchung: Vom gespaltenen Atom zum gespaltenen Gewissen&amp;nbsp;– Die Geschichte einer menschheitsgefährdenden Waffe (...and do not lead us into temptation: From the split atom to the split conscience&amp;nbsp;– the history of a mankind-endangering weapon)", vol. 11(19) (Mai 8, 1957), p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Only by "divine grace", Weizsäcker said, were they spared the temptation to build the bomb&amp;nbsp;— grace, as the German war economy was unable to mobilize the necessary resources.

Original sources about this question were not revealed until 1993, when transcripts of secretly recorded conversations among ten top German physicists, including Heisenberg and Weizsäcker, detained under [[Operation Epsilon]] at [[Farm Hall]], near [[Cambridge]] in late 1945, were published. In the conversation after the group of detainees had listened to the [[BBC Radio]] news on dropping of the atomic bomb on 6 August 1945, Weizsäcker said: "I believe the reason we didn't do it was because all the physicists didn't want to do it, on principle. If we had wanted Germany to win the war we would have succeeded!"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aip.org/history/heisenberg/p11a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

But the "Farm Hall Transcripts" also revealed that Weizsäcker had taken the lead in arguing for an agreement among the scientists that they would claim that they had never wanted to develop a German nuclear weapon. This story was at least untrue to the extent that the detainees also included scientists actively engaged in eager attempts to build a nuclear bomb, namely [[Kurt Diebner]] and [[Walter Gerlach]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/KWG/Ergebnisse/Ergebnisse26.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max von Laue]] later called this agreement "''die Lesart''" (the Version).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europhysicsnews.org/index.php?option=article&amp;access=standard&amp;Itemid=129&amp;url=/articles/epn/pdf/2007/04/epn07402.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the memorandum which the scientists drew up was drafted by Heisenberg, von Laue wrote: "''The leader in all these discussions was Weizsäcker. I did not hear any mention of any ethical point of view.''"&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, ''Hitler's Scientists, 398&lt;/ref&gt; It was this version of events which was given to Jungk as the basis of his book.

Weizsäcker himself stated that Heisenberg, [[Karl Wirtz]] and he had a private agreement to study nuclear fission to the fullest possible in order to "decide" themselves how to proceed with its technical application. "''There was no conspiracy, not even in our small three-men-circle, with certainty not to make the bomb. Just as little, there was no passion to make the bomb...''"&lt;ref&gt;CFvW August 5, 1990, Letter to Mark Walker in: CFvW, ''Lieber Freund, lieber Gegner (Dear friend, dear opponent)''. München (Hanser) 2002, pp 277-283&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent report based on additional documents from Russian archives, historian Mark Walker concludes that "''in comparison with Diebner [and] Gerlach ... Heisenberg and finally Weizsäcker did obviously not use all power they commanded to provide the National Socialists with nuclear weapons''".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/KWG/Ergebnisse/Ergebnisse26.pdf, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ivan Supek]] (one of Heisenberg's students and friends) claimed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jutarnji.hr/clanak/art-2006,3,19,supek_intervju,17440.jl?artpg=1|title=A March 2006 interview with Ivan Supek relating to 1941 Bohr&amp;nbsp;– Heisenberg meeting (Croatian)|accessdate=2007-08-13|last=[[Jutarnji list]]|publisher=Jutarnji list}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Weizsäcker was the main figure behind the famous and controversial [[Copenhagen (play)|Heisenberg–Bohr meeting]] in [[Copenhagen]] in September 1941. Allegedly, he tried to persuade Bohr to mediate for peace between Germany and Great Britain. According to Weizsäcker's own account, he had persuaded Heisenberg to meet Bohr in order to broker an accord of the international nuclear physicist "community" not to build the bomb.&lt;ref&gt;see also: Michael Schaaf [http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/ein-neues-dokument-zum-treffen-der-beiden-physiker-in-kopenhagen-1941-heisenberg-wollte-bohr-helfen,10810590,9987068.html "Heisenberg wollte Bohr helfen.

Berliner Zeitung, 5 April 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Weizsäcker worked later during the war as a professor in [[Strasbourg]]. The American capture of his laboratory and papers there in December 1944 revealed to the Western Allies that the Germans had not come close to developing a nuclear weapon.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, ''Hitler's Scientists, 335&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war career==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 422 Bild-0174, Carl Friedrich v. Weizsäcker.jpg|right|300px|Von Weizsäcker in 1983|thumb]]
Weizsäcker was allowed to return to the part of Germany administrated by the [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]] in 1946, and became director of a department for theoretical physics in the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]] in [[Göttingen]]. From 1957 to 1969, Weizsäcker was professor of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Hamburg]]. In 1957 he won the Max Planck medal. In 1970 he formulated a "[[Global governance|Weltinnenpolitik]]" (world internal policy). From 1970 to 1980, he was head of the [[Max Planck Institute]] for the Research of Living Conditions in the Modern World in [[Starnberg]]. He researched and published on the danger of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], what he saw as the conflict between the [[First World]] and the [[Third World]], and the consequences of [[environmental degradation]].

He was one of the eight signatories of the [[Memorandum of Tübingen]] which called for the recognition of the [[Oder-Neiße line]] as the official border between [[Germany]] and [[Poland]] and spoke against a possible nuclear armament of [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name="Donhoff" &gt;{{cite news |first=Marion |last=Dönhoff |author-link=Marion Dönhoff |date=2 March 1962|title=Lobbyisten der Vernunft|trans-title=Lobbyists of reason|url=https://www.zeit.de/1962/09/lobbyisten-der-vernunft/komplettansicht|language=German |work=[[Die Zeit]]|location= |access-date=17 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Memorandum" &gt;{{cite news |date=2 March 1962|title=Das Memorandum der Acht|trans-title=The Memorandum of the eight|url=https://www.zeit.de/1962/09/das-memorandum-der-acht/komplettansicht|language=German |work=[[Die Zeit]]|location= |access-date=17 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 1970s he founded, together with the Indian philosopher [[Pandit Gopi Krishna]], a research foundation "for western sciences and eastern wisdom". After his retirement in 1980 he became a [[Christian pacifism|Christian pacifist]], and intensified his work on the conceptual definition of quantum physics, particularly on the [[Copenhagen interpretation]].

His experiences in the Nazi era, and with his own behavior in that time, gave Weizsäcker an interest in questions of ethics and responsibility. In 1957,  he was one of the [[Göttinger 18]], a group of prominent German physicists who protested against the idea that the [[Bundeswehr]] (West German armed forces) should be equipped with [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s. He further suggested that [[West Germany]] should declare its definitive abdication of all kinds of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=cassidy-pip&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cassidy|first=David C.|title=Werner Heisenberg and Carl Friedrich Freiherr von Weizsäcker: A Fifty-Year Friendship|journal=Physics in Perspective|year=2015|volume=17|issue=1|doi=10.1007/s00016-014-0152-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00016-014-0152-6|accessdate=21 April 2015|bibcode = 2015PhP....17...33C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Weizsäcker died at the age of 94 in [[Söcking]] near Starnberg.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1550078/Carl-Friedrich-von-Weizsacker.html Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]&lt;/ref&gt;  Opinions are split on the question of whether he accepted his share of responsibility for the German scientific community's efforts to build a nuclear weapon for Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;For further discussion of this and other controversial issues around C.F. v. Weizsäcker see

==Theory of ur-alternatives==
Weizsäcker developed the theory of [[ur-alternative]]s (archetypal objects), publicized in his book ''Einheit der Natur'' (literal translation ''Oneness of Nature'', 1971)&lt;ref name=Weiz71&gt;{{cite book | last= von Weizsäcker | first= Carl Friedrich | authorlink= Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker | year= 1971 | title= Einheit der Natur |trans-title=The Unity of Nature | language= German}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further developed through the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Weiz85&gt;{{cite book | last= von Weizsäcker | first= Carl Friedrich | authorlink= Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker |orig-year= 1985 | title= Aufbau der Physik | language= German|trans-title=The Structure of Physics | year= 2006 | location= [[Munich]] | isbn= 978-1-4020-5234-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiz92&gt;{{cite book | last= von Weizsäcker | first= Carl Friedrich | authorlink= Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker | year= 1992 | title= Zeit und Wissen | language= German |trans-title=Time and Knowing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory [[axiom]]atically constructs [[quantum physics]] from the distinction between empirically observable, binary alternatives. Weizsäcker used his theory, a form of [[digital physics]], to derive the 3-dimensionality of space and to estimate the [[entropy]] of a [[proton]] falling into a [[black hole]].

The '''Chattisinghpora, [[Pathribal]], and [[Barakpora]] massacres''' refer to a series of three closely related incidents that took place in the [[Anantnag district]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] between 20 March 2000 and 3 April 2000 that left up to 49 [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiri]] civilians dead.

==The Chattisinghpora massacre==
{{main|Chittisinghpura massacre}}
On the evening of 20 March 2000, 15–17 gunmen, entered the village of Chattisinghpora, located in [[Anantnag district]].  They ordered all of the [[Sikh]] men and boys to assemble at the village [[gurdwara]], and systematically shot and killed 35 of them.  Many others were injured in the attack, and least one man later died of his injuries.  The sole survivor of the massacre was Nanak Singh [[Aulakh]], who recounted the events to reporters.&lt;ref name = "NDTV_Inquiry"&gt;[http://ndtv.com/topstories/showtopstory.asp?id=4455 Inquiry into Chittisinghpura Massacre comes too late residents say], ''ndtv.com''&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first time in the [[Kashmir conflict]] that Sikhs had ever been targeted. In the aftermath of the attacks, [[Minister for Home Affairs (India)|Indian Home Minister]] [[LK Advani]] offered the state's Sikh population additional protective measures, however the local Sikh leadership reportedly rejected the plan, saying that the Muslim majority had not been hostile to them before and that no protection was needed.&lt;ref name=amnesty&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/024/2000/en/ A trail of unlawful killings in Jammu and Kashmir: Chithisinghpora and its aftermath]. [[Amnesty International]]. 15 June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Mohammad Suhail Malik of [[Sialkot]], [[Pakistan]] confessed while in custody about participating in the [[massacre]] at the direction of [[Lashkar-e-Toiba]] in an interview with [[Barry Bearak]] of [[The New York Times]] although Bearak questioned the authenticity of the confession.&lt;ref name="Bearak"&gt;{{citation|last=Bearak|first=Barry|title=A Kashmiri Mystery|date=2000-12-31|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20001231mag-kashmir.html|quote=The conversation was mostly in Urdu, once again a language I did not speak. I could study his eyes but not his phrasing or inflections, the little clues as to what was being held back in the privacy of his head. When we left, I asked Surinder Oberoi, my journalist friend, if he thought Malik was telling the truth.&lt;br/&gt;'Yes, I think so,' he answered after a pause. Then he added a cautionary shrug and a sentence that stopped after the words 'But you know. . . . '&lt;br/&gt;Malik showed no signs of physical abuse, but, as with Wagay, the torture of someone in his situation would not be unusual. Once, over a casual lunch, an Indian intelligence official told me that Malik had been 'intensively interrogated.' I asked him what that usually meant. 'You start with beatings, and from there it can go almost anywhere,' he said. Certainly, I knew what most Pakistanis would say of the confession -- that the teenager would admit to anything after persistent electrical prodding by the Indians. And it left me to surmise that if his interrogators had made productive use of pain, was it to get him to reveal the truth or to repeat their lies?|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suhail Malik is a nephew of [[Hafiz Muhammad Saeed]] of [[Lashkar-e-Toiba]].&lt;ref name=Bearak/&gt;

The massacre, which took place on the eve of U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]]'s visit to the [[Subcontinent]], was widely condemned by both the [[Government of India|Indian]] and [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistani]] governments, as well as the leaders of the [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiri]] separatist movement. Although the [[Government of India]] and the state government of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] had not yet launched any official investigation into the massacre, they immediately accused two [[Islamist terrorist]] organisations, [[Lashkar e Tayyiba]] and [[Hizbul Mujahideen]].&lt;ref name=amnesty/&gt; The [[All Parties Hurriyat Conference]] however, accused the Indian government of carrying out the massacre to discredit the Kashmiri independence movement, while [[Syed Salahuddin]], head of Hizbul Mujahideen said: "Mujahideen have nothing against the Sikh community which sympathizes with our struggle. We assure them that there never was and there will never be any danger to Sikhs from Kashmiri freedom fighters."&lt;ref name=amnesty/&gt;

Local villagers ensured that the local school was up and running just two weeks after the killings. The massacre created tension and distrust between the Sikh and Muslim residents of the area, but no problems developed at the joint Muslim-Sikh village school.&lt;ref name = "NDTV_Inquiry"/&gt;

In 2010, the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) associate [[David Headley]], who was arrested in connection with the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]],  confessed to the [[National Investigation Agency]] that the LeT carried out the Chittisinghpura massacre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/Lashkar-behind-Sikh-massacre-in-Kashmir-in-2000-says-Headley/Article1-617459.aspx Lashkar behind Sikh massacre in Kashmir in 2000, says Headley]. Hindustan Times. 25 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to have identified an LeT militant named Muzzamil as part of the group which carried out the killings apparently to create communal tension just before Clinton’s visit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20101026/j&amp;k.htm#2 Chittisinghpura Massacre: Obama’s proposed visit makes survivors recall tragedy ].

==The Pathribal killings==
Five days after the events at Chattisinghpora, on 25 March 2000, Col. Ajay Saxena, Commanding Officer 7 RR  (Retired Brigadier Now), Lt. Col. Brajendra Pratap Singh 2IC 7 RR  (Retired Col Now), Lt. Saurabh Sharma Of Military Intelligence 7RR  (Retired Major Now), Lt. Amit Saxena Adjutant 7 RR  (later Major) and Nb. Sub. Idrees Khan (later Subedar) of the Indian Army killed five men in Pathribal village of [[Anantnag district]], claiming that the victims were the "foreign militants" responsible for the attacks. Official reports claimed that security forces had, after a gun fight, blown up the hut where the men were hiding, and had retrieved five bodies that had been charred beyond recognition.  The bodies were buried separately without any postmortem examination.&lt;ref name=amnesty/&gt;

Local observers and political activists doubted the Indian government's official reports however, pointing out that if there had been a gunfight, some of the security force personnel must have sustained significant injuries – but none were injured, except Major Saurabh Sharma, who suffered minor injury while abducting one of the  civilian from village. Over the following days, local villagers began to protest, claiming that the men were ordinary civilians who had been killed in a [[fake encounter]], not "foreign militants."  According to them, up to 17 men had been detained by the police and "disappeared" between 21–24 March.&lt;ref name=amnesty/&gt;  On 30 March, local authorities in [[Anantnag district|Anantnag]] relented to growing public pressure, and agreed to exhume the bodies and conduct an investigation into the deaths.

On 19 March 2012, The CBI ([[central Bureau of Investigation]]) told the [[Supreme Court of India]] that the fake encounter at Pathribal in Jammu and Kashmir 12 years ago in which seven people were killed by Army personnel "were cold-blooded murders and the accused officials deserve to be meted out exemplary punishment."
Senior counsel Ashok Bhan told a special bench of justices B S Chauhan and Swatanter Kumar that no prior sanction was required for prosecuting the Army officials and the need to ensure "public confidence in the rule of law and dispensation of justice" warranted their prosecution.

==The Barakpora killings==

===The Encounter claim by State Police===
Days later, Inspector General of Police (Kashmir range) Dr A K Bhan claimed that his personnel led by Senior Superintendent of Police Farooq Khan, in a joint operation with the army, had shot dead the five militants responsible for the Sikh massacre.
According to Dr Bhan, the government forces had surrounded a hut in Panchthalan, near Pathribal, where the terrorists were hiding. The fierce encounter that ensued ended when the shelter, with all five inside, caught fire and was destroyed.&lt;ref name="dontneeddna"&gt;{{cite web|title=I don't need DNA tests to identify my son|url=http://www.suryakumari.com/kashmir/dna.html|author=Mukthar Ahmad|author2=Basharat Peer|author3=Onkar Singh|author4=Syed Amin Jafri|last-author-amp=yes|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation===
The special investigation team inquiring into the Pathribal incident approached the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad, and the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Kolkata, with medical samples of the relatives to match with those of the slain men.
That was in 2000. Two years later, the controversy had faded from public memory when The Times of India reported that the samples from the relatives had been substituted with some others, a fact that both forensic centres had conveyed to the state police more than a year ago.
'...While the DNA samples purported to have been collected from the relatives did not match those of the DNA isolated from the exhumed bodies, in three cases, the samples of women relatives were found to have come from men,' read the Times report.&lt;ref name="dontneeddna"/&gt;

===Victims struggle for Justices===
In their little village in the militancy-hit Anantnag district, the traumatised family of Zahoor Dalal waits for justice – if not from Dr Abdullah, then from the Almighty."I do not need DNA tests to recognise my son," Dalaal's mother Raja Bano told rediff.com "We had identified his body two years ago. Since the government wanted proof, we had given them blood samples. Now we are told those have been tampered with."&lt;ref name="dontneeddna"/&gt;
Since her son's death, she has been unwell, subject to alternating fits of weeping and hysteria. The trauma has taken its toll on her daughter, Zahoor's younger sister, as well—she talks little, eats less, and faints frequently.
"Those who killed my son will not get away," Raja Bano said. "The government may help them, but Allah will not deny me justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mukthar Ahmad|author2=Basharat Peer|author3=Onkar Singh|author4=Syed Amin|last-author-amp=yes|title=I don't need DNA tests to identify my son|url=http://www.suryakumari.com/kashmir/dna.html|work=|publisher=rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Her lack of faith in Dr Abdullah's government is founded on two facts. One, the state administration, despite knowing for a year that the samples had been fudged, did not make any effort to conduct a fresh test. It collected fresh samples from the relatives only after the controversy hit the front pages and forced an admission from Dr Abdullah in the state assembly that the earlier samples had been fudged. And two, even after the Times report, senior state government officials continued to maintain that they had not received any communication from the forensic centres.&lt;ref name="www.rediff.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=I don't need DNA tests to identify my son|url=http://www.suryakumari.com/kashmir/dna.html|work=Mukthar Ahmad in Srinagar, Basharat Peer and Onkar Singh in New Delhi and Syed Amin Jafri in Hyderabad|publisher=www.rediff.com|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Dr Syed E Hasnain, director of the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, contradicted the latter claim.
"Certainly the report has been sent to the investigating officer [appointed by the Jammu and Kashmir judiciary]," Dr Hasnain confirmed to rediff.com "I cannot comment on the fudging... but we stand by what we have said in the report."&lt;ref name="www.rediff.com"/&gt;
Central Forensic Science Laboratory Director V K Kashyap told the Times: 'We had dashed off a letter to the J&amp;K government immediately after we found the samples had certain serious discrepancies. Till date we have not received a single reply from either the state authorities or the investigative agency... We finished our investigations way back in December 2000, but how can we submit a report that is meaningless?'
'The samples,' he added, 'were obviously tampered with.'&lt;ref name="www.rediff.com"/&gt;
After the Times report was published, the state government admitted that the centres had written to it, and promised that it would undertake fresh tests.Meanwhile, the cover-up attempt has strengthened the Kashmiris' belief that the five men were not terrorists—a belief that some leaders of the local Sikh community also share.&lt;ref name="www.rediff.com"/&gt;

===Response by kashmiri Sikh Community===
"The five the government killed were innocent," Niranjan Singh, president of the Anantnag District Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, told rediff.com on telephone. "They had nothing to do with the murders."
Ranjit Singh, former president of the Anantnag Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, seconded this opinion. "Nobody believes the claims of the government," he said in a telephone interview. "It is utter nonsense."&lt;ref name="www.rediff.com"/&gt;

===Another inquiry===
DR ABDULLAH, after an initial attempt to sidestep the controversy, responded with another inquiry. The chief minister told the state assembly that he was deeply 'ashamed there are agencies that can behave in such a manner.' He apologised to the assembly and promised that all those involved in collecting and sending 'fake' samples would be immediately suspended. And if found guilty by the one-member commission of inquiry he had just appointed, they would be 'dismissed and prosecuted', a Times report quoted him as saying.
Blood samples were once again collected from relatives of the five youth and sent to Kolkata and Hyderabad.&lt;ref name="www.rediff.com"/&gt;
Jammu &amp; Kashmir Chief Secretary Ashok Jaitley clarified the matter further. "We were naturally taken aback when we read that the samples had been fudged," he told rediff.com in a telephone interview. "The state government will get to the bottom of this issue, that is why we have appointed Justice G A Kuchay, former judge of the Jammu &amp; Kashmir high court, to inquire."
Jaitley said any action against those involved would follow only after the commission submits its report, which would be within two months.&lt;ref name="www.rediff.com"/&gt;
Kashmiris react with cynicism. This, they point out, is how the script read even earlier—suspension, court of inquiry, tests...
What compounds their cynicism is the fact that even as the state government sat on the communications from Hyderabad and Kolkata, it reinstated SSP Farooq Khan.&lt;ref name="www.rediff.com"/&gt;

===Response of opposition Parties===
Dr Abdullah's political opponents condemned the incident. Such actions, they said, erode the people's trust in justice and fair play.
"It clearly shows the designs of the Farooq government," said former Union home minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, People's Democratic Party leader and main rival of Dr Abdullah's National Conference. "It wants to cover up the killing of those five innocents."
True, agreed Mehbooba Mufti, Sayeed's daughter and PDP leader. "The Pathribal killing," she said, "is just one in a huge spate of grave human rights violations since the National Conference government was elected."
Another example she cites was the killing of 19 civilians, including a pregnant woman, in Poonch in 1997. "The state Human Rights Commission presented its report," she said. "But the government has taken no action till now against the surrendered militants and security force personnel involved."&lt;ref name="www.rediff.com"/&gt;
"What happens after an inquiry? Do they act on the recommendations?" she asked. "No, they don't," she said, answering her own question. "They just let it be."
Dr Abdullah's position on human rights, his critics allege, is visible in the incident that started it all—namely, the Chattisinghpora massacre.
"In any case," said Communist Party of India-Marxist legislator Yusuf Tarigami, "the basis of the protest at Barakpora was the killing of the five men at Pathribal. But the government kept that out of the Pandian Commission's purview, showing how bent it was on hiding the truth.
"Now Farooq Abdullah is talking of another inquiry, fresh samples," he continued. "But that will not achieve anything... People have lost trust in these inquiry commissions."&lt;ref name="www.rediff.com"/&gt;

===Allegations and counter-allegations===
There were allegations and counter-allegations—India said the massacre was the handiwork of Pakistan-sponsored terrorists; Pakistan-based terrorists alleged that Indian security forces were responsible. But there was no independent inquiry into the matter.
The chief minister asked Justice S R Pandian of the Supreme Court, who had inquired into the Barakpora firing and found the security force personnel guilty, to study the Sikh killings, but the judge refused to do so.
"Since he [Farooq Abdullah] was not interested in arriving at the truth, he let it be after that cosmetic exercise," his critics point out.&lt;ref name="www.rediff.com"/&gt;

===Victim Family continued Trauma===
Nothing expresses it better than Raja Bano's words: "I will give more blood, a thousand times if needed. But I don't think I will get justice from the government. Because they are the judges, they are the investigators, and they are the guilty." With no action being taken with regards to the promised investigation into the Pathribal deaths, the local population grew increasingly restless. On 3 April 2000, an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 protesters marched to the city of [[Anantnag]], where they intended to present a memorandum to the Deputy Commissioner demanding the exhumation of the bodies.  When they reached the town of Barakpora, three kilometres from Anantnag, the protesters began an unprovoked throwing of stones at an Indian paramilitary camp.  Members of the [[Central Reserve Police Force]] responded by opening fire on the protesters, killing 7 and injuring at least 15 more, of whom 1 or 2 later died of their injuries.&lt;ref name=amnesty/&gt;

==Pathribal DNA cover-up==
On 5 April 2000, [[Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir|Chief Minister]] [[Farooq Abdullah]] ordered the exhumation of the bodies from the Pathribal killings, which began the next day.  DNA samples were collected from the five bodies, as well as 15 relatives of the missing young men, and were submitted to forensic laboratories in [[Kolkata]] and [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]].  However, in March 2002 it was discovered that the DNA samples allegedly taken from the bodies of the Pathribal victims (all of whom were men) had been tampered with, when, according to a report from the [[Times of India]], lab workers found that samples had in fact been collected from females.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1862414.stm Kashmir massacre samples faked]. "[[BBC News]]," 8 March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fresh samples were collected in April 2002, which, upon testing, conclusively proved that the victims were innocent local civilians, and not foreign militants as the Indian government had been claiming for the past two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2131602.stm Kashmir massacre suspects 'innocent']. "[[BBC News]]," 16 July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The parties responsible for the initial massacre at Chattisinghpora remain unidentified – various theories have been put forward accusing both Pakistani [[Islamist]] militants, and Indian [[Ikhwan (Kashmir)|renegades]] – surrendered militants who cooperate with Indian armed forces.  In August 2000, the Indian government announced that it had captured two Pakistan-based [[Lashkar e Tayyiba]] operatives, who, in December 2000, allegedly admitted to carrying out the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/dec/31sikh.htm Lashkar militant admits killing Sikhs in Chittisinghpura]. "[[Rediff]]," 31 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; An alleged Lashkar militant, Mohammad Suhail Malik of [[Sialkot]], Pakistan, admitted to participating in the massacre.  In an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', he stated that he had been trained in mountain climbing and marksmanship by the Lashkar, and had infiltrated into India in October 1999 carrying the equivalent of $200 for expenses. Malik went on to say that he knew nothing about the plot to kill the Sikhs until he stood in an orchard where the 35 people were killed, and had opened fire because he had been ordered to do so by his commanders.  He stated that while "the Koran teaches us not to kill innocents...if Lashkar told us to kill those people, then it was right to do it. I have no regrets."&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;Bearak, Barry. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E2DD1138F932A05751C1A9669C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 A Kashmiri Mystery]. "[[The New York Times]]." 31 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the same article, the author decried the conditions under which the interview was conducted, and expressed doubt about the veracity of the confession.  He stated that Malik gave few details in his answers, primarily repeating information from official police dossiers, and expressed concern that Malik may have been tortured while in custody.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;  At one point in the article he states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I wanted to interview the teenager once more, this time without the authorities present. Somehow, I thought I could win his trust, offer him an out, persuade him that he did not have to confess to the massacre unless it was true.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 10 August 2011, a Delhi court acquitted both Malik and another Pakistani national, Waseem Ahmed, of the charge of involvement in the Chattisinghpora massacre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-08-10/india/29871318_1_pakistani-nationals-massacre-sikhs Sikhs' massacre in Chattisinghpora: Two Pakistanis acquitted]. "[[The Times of India]]," 10 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some human rights organisations have also expressed doubt about the veracity of these admissions. Independent inquiries by human rights activists from [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and the [[Ludhiana]]-based [[National Human Rights Commission of India|International Human Rights Organization]] have found that it is unlikely that the attacks were carried out by Indian security forces themselves, and that the perpetrators were most likely renegades.&lt;ref name=amnesty/&gt;

In 2005, Sikh organisations such as the Bhai Kanahiya Jee Nishkam Seva Society demanded a deeper state inquiry into the details of the massacre&lt;ref name = "Tribune"&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20051112/j&amp;k.htm#3 Sikhs want CBI probe into Chittisinghpura Massacre], ''tribuneindia.com''&lt;/ref&gt; and for the inquiry to be made public. In the wake of arrest of an Army officer for [[Malegaon blasts]], Sikhs of J&amp;K have demanded into the Chattisinghpora massacre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/web1/08nov20/state.htm#10 Sikhs for judicial probe into Chattisingpora massacre "[[Daily Excelsior]]," 8 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinton controversy==
The massacre coincided with the visit of United States president [[Bill Clinton]] to India. In an introduction to a book written by [[Madeleine Albright]] titled ''[[The Mighty and the Almighty: Reflections on America, God, and World Affairs]]'', she accused "Hindu militants" of perpetrating the act. Hindu organisations protested the statement, and ultimately the publishers, [[Harper Collins]], edited the statement out of future editions of the book. They acknowledged the error in an email to the [[Times of India]]:&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;[http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=VE9JTS8yMDA2LzA1LzE5I0FyMDE0MDE=&amp;Mode=HTML&amp;Locale=english-skin-custom Clinton goofs up on J&amp;K killings],''Times of India''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Page xi of the Mighty and the Almighty contains a reference to Hindu militants that will be deleted in subsequent printings, both in America and in international editions. This error was due to a failure in the fact-checking process.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clinton's office never clarified the statement.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; In the hours immediately after the massacre in March 2000, the US condemned the killings but refused to accept the Indian government's contention that it was the work of [[Pakistan]]i [[Islamist]] groups. Clinton explicitly condemned the massacre by "unknown groups," and re-emphasised that point in his 2004 autobiography, ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]''.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;  Similarly, in his 2004 book [[Engaging India: Diplomacy, Democracy, and the Bomb]], Clinton aide [[Strobe Talbott]] confirms Clinton's misgivings about the massacre, pointing out that "he [Clinton] did not endorse the accusation that Pakistan was behind the violence since the US had no independent confirmation."&lt;ref name="Tribune"/&gt;

==Chattisinghpora massacre in film==
The massacre was depicted in the commercial [[Bollywood]] film [[Adharm (2006 film)|Adharm]] (unholy) directed by Adeep Singh.

'''Benti Chaupai''' (also referred to as '''Chaupai Sahib''') is a hymn by Guru Gobind Singh. Chaupai is the 405th [[Charitar]] of the Charitropakhyan of the [[Dasam Granth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Kohli |first=Surindar |title= Limited |isbn= 978-812151044-8 |page= xliii }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a part of a [[Sikh]]'s [[Nitnem]] (daily scripture reading). Chaupai Sahib begins after the 404 Chittar where two massive battles, including the later between Maha Kal and the devils, is narrated and the struggle of a goddess that was born as a result of the first battle and her quest for the acceptance of the [[Supreme Being]], by her abandoning all other worldly desires, is illustrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bindra |first= Pritpal |title= Chritro Pakhyaan: Tales Of Male-Female Tricky Deceptions From Sri Dasam Granth Volume II |year=2002 |publisher= B. Chattar Singh Jiwan Singh |location= Amritsar |isbn=8176014842|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benti Chaupai consists of three parts: Kabiyo Bach Benti Chaupai, Arril and Chaupai, and Savaiye and Dohra. Kabiyo Bach Benti Chaupai is normally referred to as '''Chaupai''' in short.

==Method and purpose==

This hymn offers one protection and security and many Sikhs recite this Bani to gain spiritual safety and defense from external and internal enemies, worries and afflictions. The [[Gurmukhi]] gives one self-confidence and an upbeat feeling. This Bani gives one the feeling of reliability and dependability on the Lord.

According to the researchers: Gurinder Singh Mann, Leicester UK and Dr Kamalroop Singh, London, the Chaupai Sahib was completed at Gurdwara Bhabour Sahib, Nangal as the closure of Sri Charitropakhyan written by the Tenth Guru. They show the proof of this in their book: Sri Dasam Granth Questions and Answers: London: Archimedes Press, 2011. These authors have received their University degrees on the Sri Dasam Granth Sahib.

{{Culture of Assam}}

The 'Deori' is one of the major indigenous communities of Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, India. They historically live in the upper plains or also called as the hinterland of the [[Brahmaputra Valley]]. The Deori community belongs to the [[Sino-Tibetan]] family of Mongoloid stock (as is generally the case of the people of northeast India).

The people of Deori tribe are mainly divided into four groups or clans, namely [[Dibongia]], Bor-geeya, [[Tengaponiya]] and [[Pator-goya]]. The entire people of each main clan or main group are again subdivided into several sub-clans or sub-groups. The word "sub-clan" or "sub-group" is called "Boja" or "Bahor" in Deori language. Each Deori people wants to know or wants to inform about their main clan and sub-clan (sub-group) in their first introduction. Otherwise, their introduction remains incomplete.

==History==

History says that the homeland of the Deoris is in the North Eastern states of India or in the east of undivided Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. As per the folklore of the tribe, they initially settled in the Sotai hills which are located in today's [[Sonitpur district]] (previously known as Hadapeshvar). For unknown reasons, they migrated to the northeast and settled in [[Sadiya]] region. Deoris believed that they were once the priests of the [[Kamakhya temple]] which they recall in their folktales and songs. According to the book ''Mataks and their kingdom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dutta, Sristidhar|year=1985|title=The Mataks and their kingdom: castes and tribes of Assam|location=Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh|publisher=Chugh Publications|oclc=13959339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts claim that the [[Patorgoyan clan]] assimilated with the [[Tiwa (Lalung)|Tiwa]] tribe in central Assam but there has been no scientific evidence to support the claim, which prompted a section of Deoris to begin a search. A preliminary investigation from September 30 to October 5 under the aegis of ''Jimachaya Giyan Aru Juktibadi Samaj'' has given positive indication of the presence of Deori people in [[Kachin State|Kachin]] province and near [[Yangon]] in Myanmar. A team of researchers has decided to visit Myanmar in search of the lost clan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/to-myanmar-in-search-of-a-lost-clan-of-the-deoris-tribe-of-assam/article6485876.ece&lt;/ref&gt; Only the people of Dibongiya class can speak their own mother tongue, and almost all the other classes mysteriously lost their language. The three classes of Deoris live in the districts mentioned above.

As a result, Almonte spent 10 days in a [[federal prison]] in [[Pennsylvania]]. If convicted, he faced seven years in prison and possibly [[deportation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/12/nyregion/effort-to-bulk-up-skinny-son-puts-a-minister-in-legal-peril.html|title=Effort to Bulk Up Skinny Son Puts a Minister in Legal Peril|author=Toy, Vivian S.|publisher=''New York Times''|date=February 12, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1999, prosecutors moved to drop the charges against Almonte. When the dismissal was announced, a crowd of 3,000 supporters gathered outside Queens County Courthouse to show their support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/04/nyregion/queens-prosecutor-will-drop-drug-charges-against-minister.html|title=Queens Prosecutor Will Drop Drug Charges Against Minister|publisher=''New York Times''|author=Toy, Vivian S.|date=March 4, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frataraka ( Prtkr')'''  is an ancient [[Persian Empire|Persian]] title, interpreted variously as “leader, governor, forerunner”.&lt;ref name="ei"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frataraka|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/frataraka|website=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|publisher=[[Columbia University]]|accessdate=23 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[epithet]] or [[title]] of a series of rulers in [[Persis]] from 3rd BC till mid 2nd BC prior to the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] conquest of West Asia and Iran. Studies of ''frataraka coins'' are important to historians of this period.&lt;ref name="curtis2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Curtis|first1=Vesta Sarkhosh|editor1-last=Curtis|editor1-first=John|editor2-last=Simpson|editor2-first=St. John|title=The world of Achaemenid Persia history, art and society in Iran and the ancient Near East|date=2010|publisher=I.B.

==Roles of the frataraka==
During the [[Achaemenid Empire]], frataraka was a title given to the head of a district or province in Egypt, who was junior in superiority to the [[satrap]] in [[Memphis, Egypt]].&lt;ref name="ei" /&gt; During the time of [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] and [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] Empires, the [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] on their coins suggest, depending on interpretation, that they served either [[deities]] such as [[Ahura Mazda]] or god-like kings such as the [[Achaemenid Empire#Achaemenid kings and rulers|Achaemenids]] or 
[[List of Seleucid rulers|Seleucids]].&lt;ref name="ei" /&gt;

==Frataraka coins==

{{Empty section|date=January 2018}}

==Summary==
There are many controversies and debates about the origin, datings and Sequences of Rulers.
First Bunch GF Hill (first one to catalog and study them and he opted same as herzfeld to early 3rd BC dating) but Alram and historian Wiesehofer all pointed to late dating of them iconographically epigraphically and also seamless continuation of their coinage from first series to second and so on. They argued that they ruled by late 2nd BC and ended by mid 2nd BC after [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] conquered [[Persia]].

Some scholars such as Museler, Sarkhosh Curtis, Hoover, Engles and Mahdi Ahrabi all believe they have started ruling by 3rd BC and there are plenty of evidence produced by researchers pointing to it.
First, there are couple of hoards discovered by Herzfeld since 1930's,which till now showing existence of Frataraka coins with [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus I]] victories and trophy coins which were issued by him during 305-301 BC and if we take the circulation average of 20 years, we reach to 285-280 BC and that year coincides with his death and being replaced by his co regent and his son Antiochus I. 
There were no other coins from other [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] rulers discovered with Frataraka hoards suggesting the Frataraka got semi independent and started to strike their coins instead(actually there were some scarce [[Alexander the Great]] and Seleucus I and his co ruler in Persia [[Antiochus I Soter|Antiochus I]] in Some parts of Persia and some hoards discovered in 1930's and 1960-70's contain coins of them with some Frataraka rulers indicating many interpretations which still is open to conclude).There are other evidences as well.
The quite numbers of undertype of Seleucus I on coins of Frataraka rulers also point out to their closeness to first Seleucid king and some early Seleucid influences both in iconography and typology of their coins shows they were ruling Persis in earlier than 2nd BC.
The names of some [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] satrap mentioned as late as 222 BC with name Alexandros brother of melon upper satrap before accession of Antiochus III.

{{IPA_notice}}

'''Gefilte fish''' ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|ə|ˈ|f|ɪ|l|t|ə|_|f|ɪ|ʃ}}; from {{lang-yi|געפֿילטע פֿיש}}, "stuffed fish") is a dish made from a [[Poaching (cooking)|poached]] mixture of ground deboned fish, such as [[carp]], [[Whitefish (fisheries term)|whitefish]], or [[Esox|pike]]. It is traditionally served as an appetizer by [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] [[Jew]]ish households. Although it historically consisted of a minced-fish [[forcemeat]] stuffed inside the fish skin, this step has been commonly omitted since the 19th century and the seasoned fish is most commonly formed into patties similar to ''[[quenelle]]s'' or [[fish ball]]s. These are popular on [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish Holidays]] such as [[Passover]], although they may be consumed throughout the year.

In [[Poland]], gefilte fish, referred to as ''karp po żydowsku'' ("carp Jewish-style"), is a traditional dish in some [[Catholic Church in Poland|Polish]] homes (more commonly in the northern regions near the [[Baltic Sea]]), served on [[Christmas Eve]] (for [[Twelve-dish Christmas Eve supper|Twelve-dish supper]]) and on [[Holy Saturday]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=Culinary Tourism|editor-first=Lucy M.|editor-last=Long|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|date=1998|contribution=Chapter 4: Flavors of Memory: Jewish Food as Culinary Tourism in Poland|first=Eve|last=Jochnowitz|pages=97-113}} &lt;blockquote&gt;''In the public imagination of both Americans and Poles, it is frequently gefilte fish-particularly sweetened gefilte fish-that has outdistanced matzoh as the food that first comes to mind when Jewish food is discussed (Cooper 1993; dc Pomianc 1985). Gefilte fish is sometimes referred to as ''karp po żydowsku'' or "Jewish carp," ... Many restaurants in Cracow and Warsaw that are in no other way marked as Jewish offer ''karp po żydowsku'' as either an appetizer or a main course. Stranger still, ''karp po żydowsku'' has become a traditional dish in many Catholic Polish homes for Christmas Eve and Holy Saturday, traditionally meatless feasts.'' ([https://books.google.com/books?id=8WkumSPd7acC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA109#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 109])&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preparation and serving ==
[[File:Gefilte fish - step 20 (Anschnitt 3).JPG|thumb|200px|left|Gefilte fish: whole stuffed and garnished fish]]
Traditionally, [[carp]], [[Esox|pike]], [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]], or [[Coregonus|whitefish]] were used to make gefilte fish, but more recently other fish with white flesh such as [[Nile perch]] have been used, and there is a pink variation using [[salmon]]. There are even vegetarian variations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishfood-list.com/recipes/fish/gfish/gfishveg01.html Gefilte "Fish," Vegetarian] Accessed November 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fish fillet]]s are ground with eggs, onion, bread or [[matzo]] crumbs, and spices to produce a paste or dough which is then boiled in [[fish stock (food)|fish stock]].&lt;ref&gt;Попова, М. Ф., ''Секреты Одесской кухни'', Друк, Одесса, 2004, p.163 (Russian) Popova M.F., ''Secrets of Odessa Cuisine''. Druk, Odessa, 2004, p.163&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally gefilte fish is cooked and served as egg-shaped patties, like [[quenelle]]s, but sometimes it is cooked in large logs or terrines and then sliced for serving. In the United Kingdom, gefilte fish is commonly fried.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://forward.com/food/103824/gefilte-fish-fried-to-perfection/|title=Gefilte Fish, Fried to Perfection|work=The Forward|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually served cold or at room temperature. Each piece may be topped with a slice of carrot, with a [[horseradish]] mixture called [[chrain|''khreyn'']] on the side.

Due to the previous general poverty of the [[Jewish population in Europe]] and especially Eastern Europe, where the dish originated, an economical recipe for the above also may have included finely ground and soaked matzo meal or bread crumbs. This form of preparation eliminated the need for picking out fish bones at the table, and "stretched" the (expensive) fish further, so that even poor, large families could enjoy fish on Shabbat. Not only is picking bones religiously prohibited on the Sabbath, but many of the common fish used in the dish, such as carp, are exceptionally bony and difficult to eat in whole form. The fish bones can then be used in making fish stock.

In Polish Catholic homes, gefilte fish ({{lang-pl|karp po żydowsku}}) is a traditional dish to be eaten on Christmas Eve and Holy Saturday, as these are traditionally meatless feasts.&lt;ref name="CT"&gt;Johnowitz, Eva. Chapter 4, "Flavors of Memory", in ''Culinary Tourism'', Lucy M. Long (ed.) University Press of Kentucky, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This follows a pattern in which a number of Jewish dishes were also eaten on Catholic religious days in Poland.&lt;ref name="CT"/&gt;

== Variations ==
Gefilte fish may be slightly sweet or [[Umami|savory]]. Preparation of gefilte fish with sugar or [[black pepper]] is considered an indicator of whether a Jewish community was [[Galitzianer]] (with sugar) or [[Lithuanian Jews|Litvak]] (with pepper); the boundary separating northern from southern [[Yiddish dialects|East Yiddish]] has thus been dubbed "the Gefilte Fish Line".&lt;ref&gt;Bill Gladstone: [http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/11588/this-is-no-fish-tale-gefilte-tastes-tell-story-of-ancestry/ This is no fish tale: Gefilte tastes tell story of ancestry]. Jewish Telegraphic Agency, September 10, 1999. Accessed November 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ready-to-serve ==
[[File:Jars of gefilte fish.jpg|thumb|Jars of gefilte fish in Israel]]
The post-WWII method of making gefilte fish commercially takes the form of patties or balls, or utilizes a [[wax paper]] casing around a "log" of ground fish, which is then poached or baked. This product is sold in cans and glass jars, and packed in jelly made from fish broth. The [[sodium]] content is relatively high at 220–290&amp;nbsp;mg/serving. Low-salt, low-carbohydrate, low-cholesterol, sugar-free, and [[kosher]] varieties are available. The patent ({{patent|US|3108882|"Method for Preparing an Edible Fish Product"}}) for this jelly, which allowed mass-market distribution of gefilte fish, was granted on October 29, 1963 to [[Monroe Nash]] and Erich G. Freudenstein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=lzxjAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4&amp;source=gbs_overview_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Method of Preparing an Edible Fish Product]. Accessed November 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Gefilte fish are also sold frozen in "logs".

Among religiously observant Jews, gefilte fish has become a traditional Shabbat food to avoid ''borer'', which is one of the 39 [[activities prohibited on Shabbat]] outlined in the [[Shulchan Aruch]]. ''Borer'', literally "selection/choosing", would occur when one picks the bones out of the fish, taking "the chaff from within the food".&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Zushe Blech: [http://www.kashrut.com/articles/fisharticle/ "The Fortunes of a Fish"], Kashrut.com website. Accessed March 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A less common belief is that fish are not subject to ''[[ayin hara]]'' ("[[evil eye]]") because they are submerged while alive, so that a dish prepared from several fish varieties brings good luck.&lt;ref&gt;Gil Marks: [http://www.ou.org/shabbat/recipes/fish.htm "Something's fishy in the State of Israel"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060329185135/http://www.ou.org/shabbat/recipes/fish.htm |date=2006-03-29 }}, [[Orthodox Union]] website.  Accessed March 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish is [[pareve]], neither meat nor dairy, and, according to [[kosher]] law, it may be eaten at both meat and dairy meals, although according to [[halakha]] law, fish and meat should not be eaten together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/735391/rabbi-aryeh-lebowitz/eating-fish-and-meat-together/ |author=Aryeh Lebowitz |title=Eating Fish and Meat Together |date=June 19, 2009 |access-date=April 1, 2017 |publisher=Yeshiva University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently the villages is dominated by Muslims [[Meo]]s, though Hindus also live there.&lt;ref name=HR-Watch&gt;[http://haryanawatch.blogspot.sg/2008/09/muslim-residents-of-ghasera-village-in.html Haryana Watch - Muslims of Ghasera]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ruined walls and a grand entrance show that Ghasera was a historical village.

During the reign of [[Aurangzeb]] there was a [[Rajput]] freebooter named Hathi Singh [[rajput clans|Badgujar]] at Dahana (now called [[Badshahpur]] village in [[Mewat district]]).&lt;ref name=Har-rev-2/&gt; He sought the help of [[Jat people|Jat]] King [[Churaman]] of [[Bharatpur State]] to seek his help to obtain pardon from [[Aurangzeb]], which was granted to him on the condition that he will kill the famed bandit ''Sanwali''. For achieving this task, he was granted pardon and given a [[jagir]] of 11 villages by [[Aurangzeb]] that included Ghasera, Indor, Kotla and [[Sohna]], he built his fort at [[Ghasera]].

Hathi Singh [[rajput clans|Badgujar]] was succeeded by his son ''Bhadur Singh [[rajput clans|Badgujar]]'' who entered in allaiance with [[Malhar Rao Holkar]] of [[Indore]] who was the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] Subhedar of [[Malwa]] to attack the [[Rajput]] King [[Madho Singh I|Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh I]] of [[Jaipur]].  [[Madho Singh I|Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh I]] sought the help of [[Jat people|Jat]] king [[Surajmal|Maharaja Surajmal]] of [[Bharatpur State]].

In 1753, [[Surajmal|Maharaja Surajmal]] besieged Ghasera fort of ''Bhadur Singh [[rajput clans|Badgujar]]''.&lt;ref name="ESQUIRE1882"&gt;{{cite book|author=F. C. CHANNING, ESQUIRE|title=LAND REVENUE SETTLEMENT OF THE GURGAON DISTRICT|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75kIAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=5 November 2012|year=1882}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the battle, Bahadur Singh lost and his wives committed suicide.

In 1754, after Ghasera [[Jat people|Jats]] turned to [[Delhi]], defeated the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal king]] [[Ahmad Shah Bahadur]], occupied the [[Red Fort]] there, took away the bounty and gates of Red fort with them to humiliate the Mughals.&lt;ref name="Jat1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Har-rev-2"/&gt;

'''Hindu Temple of Central Indiana (HTCI)''' is a [[hindu temple]] located in [[Indianapolis]]. The temple is currently located at 3350 N. German Church Rd in the middle of several cornfields&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.pbs.org/show/temple-makers/|title = Temple Makers|website = PBS|access-date = 27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
Before the creation of HTCI, most hindus would go to [[Hindu Temple of Dayton]] or temples in Chicago for hindu worship services. Members of the Hindu Community in the [[Indianapolis Metropolitan Area]] decided to create a Hindu Temple which was inaugurated in 2006. In 2011, HTCI held a ceremony for its new idols, Sri Subramanya and Sri Ayyappa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.eurasiareview.com/24032012-hindu-temple-of-central-indiana-holding-elaborate-3-day-consecration-ceremony/|title = Hindu Temple of Central Indiana Holding Elaborate 3 Day Consecration Ceremony|website = eurasiareview|date = 24 March 2012|access-date = 27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In June 2015, the temple's $10 Million worship hall was opened. The worship hall contains 17 shrines to various Hindu Deities spread over 4 different [[Gopurams]], with the main tower being over 99 feet tall&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2015/03/17/expansion-indy-hindu-temple-open-june/24939491/|website = indystar|title = $10M expansion of Indy Hindu temple to open in June|date = 18 March 2015|access-date = 27 October 2018|author = Wang, Stephanie}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{Politics of Trinidad and Tobago}}
The '''Jamaat al Muslimeen''' (from Arabic جماعة المسلمين, also transliterated as Jamaat-ul Muslimeen or Jama'at al-Muslimeen, "School of Muslims", "Group of Muslims", "The Muslim Group", "The Muslim Assembly", "The Muslim Society", "The Muslim Community") is a religious [[Muslim]] organisation within the Republic of [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. 

The organisation is best known for the [[Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt]] of July 1990, in which its leader, Imam [[Yasin Abu Bakr]], led members of the Jamaat in an attempted ''[[coup d'état]]'' against the elected Government of Trinidad and Tobago. Over a six-day period members of the government, including then-Prime Minister [[A. N. R. Robinson|A.N.R. Robinson]], were held hostage at gunpoint, while the group occupied a television station and parliament, and chaos and looting broke out in the streets of the capital, [[Port of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1164|title=Jamaat al-Muslimin (Trinidad)|work=oxfordislamicstudies.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The background for the foundation of movement is a widespread presence of black racism, the division of community on the basis of race, the illicit drug trade and ideology of extremist jihad. The next step was a development of a militant Islamic discourse which insisted that liberation for especially Afro-Trinidadians and Tobagonians was only found within the ambit of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Jihad-Trinidad-Tobago-July-1990/dp/0595228348&lt;/ref&gt; As the result, a group called Jamaat al Muslimeen (JAM), an Afro-Trinidadian Muslim movement, was founded.

==Coup attempt==
{{Main|Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt}}
In July 1990, forty-two insurgents stormed the parliament, taking Prime Minister Arthur Napoleon Raymond (ANR) Robinson and most of his staff hostage. Seventy-two insurgents stormed a local police station, and at 6:00 PM JAM leader Yasin Abu Bakr told the public the government had been overthrown. During the four-day siege in which 24 people were killed, JAM agreed to surrender in exchange for amnesty. Abu Bakr and 114 of his followers were granted presidential pardons, which were later retracted, but no JAM members from the coup have ever served jail time in connection with the attack. 

A court ruling upheld an amnesty agreement obtained during the incarceration of parliament by the group.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} This led to the non-prosecution of its members for this crime despite the contention that the fact that guns and force were used to obtain said amnesty constituted duress. Subsequent to the attempted coup, it aligned itself publicly first with the [[United National Congress]] (in the run-up to the [[Trinidad and Tobago general election, 1995|1995 General Elections]]) and later with the [[People's National Movement]] (PNM), the party which formed the Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago until May 2010.

==Other crimes==
Before and since those elections, however, present and past members have been connected or prosecuted for serious violent crimes. These crimes include drug and gang related killings, rape and a current spree of kidnappings for ransom of members of the local upper and middle class.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsday.co.tt/news/0,31788.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsday.co.tt/crime_and_court/0,68875.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsday.co.tt/news/0,214763.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://guardian.co.tt/news/2015-07-27/11-accused-dana-seetahals-murder-will-reappear-court-24-august&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation's leader is currently being prosecuted with conspiracy to [[murder]] several of the group's former members who had spoken out publicly against the Jamaat al Muslimeen and its practices, and who were suspected of becoming witnesses in legal proceedings against its members.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

In 2005, The group was suspected of being linked to a series of bombings in Port-of-Spain and also for a group member arrested in the United States for attempting to ship 70 assault rifles from Fort Lauderdale to Trinidad.
As of March 2007, three members of the Jamaat al Muslimeen have confessed to their role in the kidnapping, rape, and murder of a businesswoman, [[Vindra Naipaul-Coolman]].&lt;ref&gt;http://newsday.co.tt/news/0,53164.html&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, these men are under surveillance by the local [[National Security Agency]] as well as the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] for suspected terrorist relations with the [[Middle East]], as are two other Muslim factions.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} On 24 July 2015,  they escaped and commenced in a shootout in the Country's capital [[Port of Spain]] and the Port of Spain General Hospital which put the capital on a lock down and caused the twin islands to be on high alert. One escapee was killed by the police during a later shoot-out at the Port of Spain general hospital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/Prisoner-killed--others-injured-during-daylight-jail-break Jamaica Observer] article&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu Bakr was investigated in 2007 when the reports of an attempted bombing attempt at John F. Kennedy (JFK) Airport linked JAM to one of the perpetrators, a Trinidadian national. The suspects reportedly asked Abu Bakr for assistance in carrying out this plot. Abu Bakr and JAM deny any connection to participating in the plot.

In 2014, eleven JAM members allegedly participated in the assassination of [[Dana Seetahal]], an independent senator.  During the trial a Special Branch intelligence memo featuring an unconfirmed report was leaked to social media. The report indicated that law enforcement feared violence from JAM amid reports the group may have been moving arms in preparation for an attack on police stations. No attack materialised however.

On 14 July 2015, JAM members launched an armed jailbreak of the suspected assassins in the Seetahal case. During a shoot out one police officer and one JAM member were killed.

JAM and Abu Bakr’s influence has waned somewhat with the rise of IS has made its presence known in the region. 89 Trinidadian and Tobagonians’ have already pledged allegiance to the group and a group of Salafists attempted to assassinate the prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2016/02/25/trinidad-and-tobagos-struggles-against-the-jihadist-resistance/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khuda''' or '''Khoda''' ({{lang-fa|خدا}}) is the [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] word for "Lord" or "[[God]]". Originally, it was used in reference to [[Ahura Mazda]] (the name of God in [[Zoroastrianism]]).

== Etymology ==
[[File:Khudainurdu.png|250px|thumb|left|The word '''''Khuda''''' in [[Nastaʿlīq script]]]]

The term derives from [[Middle Iranian languages|Middle Iranian]] terms ''xvatay, xwadag'' meaning "lord", "ruler", "master", appearing in written form in [[Parthian language|Parthian]] ''kwdy'', in [[Middle Persian]] ''kwdy'', and in [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] ''kwdy''.  It is the Middle Persian reflex of older Iranian forms such as  [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''x&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt;a-dhata-'' "self-defined; [[Autocracy|autocrat]]", an epithet of [[Ahura Mazda]].&lt;!-- Menog-i Khirad also has Zaman-i derang xvatay;  epithet of Time, i.e. [[Zurvanism|Zurvan]]--&gt; The [[Pashto language|Pashto]] term ''Xdāi'' (خدۍ) is either a Persian loanword or an Eastern Iranian cognate.

Prosaic usage is found for example in the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] title ''katak-xvatay'' to denote the head of a clan or extended household or in the title of the 6th century ''[[Khwaday-Namag]]'' "Book of Lords", from which the tales of [[Kayanian dynasty]] as found in the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' derive.

== Zoroastrianism ==

Semi-religious usage appears, for example, in the epithet ''zaman-i derang xvatay'' "[[Zurvanism|time]] of the long dominion", as found in the ''[[Menog-i Khrad]]''. The fourth and eighty-sixth entry of the [[Pazend]] prayer titled ''[[101 Names of God]]'', ''Harvesp-Khoda'' "Lord of All" and ''Khudawand'' "Lord of the Universe", respectively, are compounds involving ''Khuda''.&lt;ref&gt;
Edalji Kersâspji Antiâ, ''Pazend texts'', Bombay 1909, pp. 335–337.[https://archive.org/details/pzendtexts00antiuoft]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Application of ''khuda'' as  "''the'' Lord" ([[Ahura Mazda]]) is represented in the first entry in the medieval ''[[Frahang-i Pahlavig]]''.

== Islamic usage ==

In Islamic times, the term came to be used for [[God in Islam]], paralleling the Arabic [[Names of God in Islam|name of God]] ''Al-Malik'' "Owner, King, Lord, Master".

The phrase [[Khuda Hafiz]] (meaning ''May God be your Guardian'') is a [[parting phrase]] commonly used in [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Bengali Language|Bengali]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]], as well as in [[Urdu]] among [[South Asian]] [[Muslim]]s.

It also exists as a [[loanword]], used for [[God in Islam|God]] in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] (''Hüdâ''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zorlu |first1=Tuncay |title=Innovation and Empire in Turkey: Sultan Selim III and the Modernisation of the Ottoman Navy |date=2008 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-0857713599 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Muslims in [[Bengali Language|Bengali]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]].

* [[Douglas Adams]] (1952–2001): British radio and television writer and novelist.&lt;ref&gt;"I am a radical Atheist..." Adams in an interview by American Atheists [https://web.archive.org/web/20071228115639/http://www.americanatheist.org/win98-99/T2/silverman.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mary Adams (broadcaster)|Mary Adams]] (1898–1984): English producer and [[BBC]] television administrator.&lt;ref&gt;"She was a socialist, a romantic communist, and could charm with her charisma, spontaneity, and quick informed intelligence. She was a fervent atheist and advocate of humanism and common sense, accepting her stance without subjecting it to analysis." Sally Adams: 'Adams , Mary Grace Agnes (1898–1984)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30750] (accessed April 29, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Phillip Adams]] (1939–): Australian broadcaster, writer, film-maker, left-wing radical thinker, and iconoclast. He was the [[Council of Australian Humanist Societies|Australian Humanist of the Year]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;In a letter by Adams dated August 10, 1993: "I've spent a life-time attacking religious beliefs and have not wavered from a view of the universe that many would regard as bleak. Namely, that it is a meaningless place devoid of deity{{sic}}"[http://www.theabsolute.net/minefield/adams.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Adithya (actor)|Adithya]] (1974–): Indian actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infidel-man.blogspot.com/|title=The Big Bang|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Joe Ahearne]] (1963–): British television [[screenwriting|writer]] and [[television director|director]].&lt;ref&gt;Interviewer: "Has researching subjects such as exorcism and possession forced you to challenge your belief system?" Ahearne: "No I'm a devout atheist and endlessly fascinated with the issue of faith in the impossible. It's true I bought a cross when we were shooting in Rome and I'm still wearing it. And it's true some of the actors had unnerving stories to tell during the shoot. My unfaith remains unshaken however. I need big miracles to make me believe. So far I've just been teased by the paranormal." [http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/10_october/31/apparitions4.shtml Interview with writer, Joe Ahearne], BBC Press Office, 31 October 2008 (accessed 28 November 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Brandy Alexandre (1964–): American [[pornographic actor|adult actress]].&lt;ref name="Alexandre"&gt;"I do not believe in God. There is too much science now that refutes the existence of a supreme creator, at least for me, and the miracles of old are easily explained today." {{cite book | last = Allen Smith | first = Warren | title = Celebrities in Hell: A Guide to Hollywood's Atheists, Agnostics, Skeptics, Free Thinkers, and More | publisher = Barricade Books Inc. | year = 2002 | isbn=1-56980-214-9 | page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]] (1953–): British comedian, actor, singer and writer.&lt;ref&gt;"One of the many reasons Allen made the documentary was to explore his own atheism. Unlike most non-believers, he claims, in all seriousness, to have once seen God. It was at Glastonbury during the 1980s, and (as is the case with most of the splendid anecdotes that litter his conversation), it involved enough mind-altering substances to stun a baby elephant. [...] Like any considered atheist, particularly one who will burn in Hell, he lives according to a moral code that refuses to romanticise things like love, or devotion." Guy Adams, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/serious-documentary-maker-is-keith-allen-having-a-laugh-454048.html Serious documentary maker?

* [[Robert Altman]] (1925–2006): American film director.&lt;ref&gt;"Still, it's worth noting that by the age of 20 this whistle-blower had resisted two of the most powerful institutions - church and army, both. He is an atheist, "And I have been against all of these wars ever since." " Suzie Mackenzie interviewing Altman, 'Still up to mischief', ''The Guardian'', May 1, 2004, Pg. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Alejandro Amenábar]] (1972–): Spanish-Chilean film director.&lt;ref&gt;"Though the crusaders in this film are actually Christian, Amenabar – who when pushed during the conversation Sunday said he was personally an atheist – said he had no particular present group in mind when making 'Agora.'&amp;nbsp;" Brian Brooks, [http://www.indiewire.com/article/2009/05/18/not_anti-christian_amenabars_agora_crusades/ "Amenabar: Not anti-Christian, but Crusading Against Fundamentalism with 'Agora'&amp;nbsp;"], Indiewire.com, 18 May 2009 (accessed 26 May 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Wil Anderson]] (1974–): Australian comedian, radio presenter, and television host.&lt;ref&gt;"Of course, Anderson has never avoided controversy, but this show promises to be his most contentious yet. As an out-and-proud atheist, he's asking, "If the world truly does have an intelligent design, why is everything so f——ed?"—Lallo, Michael (April 5, 2007), [http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/in-your-face/2007/04/04/1175366249867.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 Wil to Succeed], ''[[The Age]]'', [[Fairfax Media]].

None of this is rational, or particularly logical. It is how religion happens: a heap of childhood influence, a questing mind as the search begins, a failure to find new or surprising answers, a sound respect for the minds that once shaped doctrine and then the settling for a quiet and untroubled agnosticism. It is merely a timid temperament that inhibits me from declaring a bold, defiant atheism.&lt;br /&gt;
Mine has been an outlook evolved from its time, growing from a particular period of history of absolutes and certainties. Everything shifted for devoutly held faith when schools began teaching comparative religion. From then on, the game was up. If each religion, it was now taught, has its own legitimacy, its own beliefs and concept of the divine, what is to say whether one is any better than another?"

This is destined to repeat itself, unless we can evolve towards a secular, moral compass, that enables us to respect each other, and respect our ideas, and respect the accidental, biological genius of humankind, that has come about largely not through design, but through accident, and not to piss it up against the wall by demeaning ourselves into imagining that there is some divine master plan that gives the earth and gives the world 'sense'..., if we can accept that all we have is each other, that's all we have, then we may respect each other a little more.

* [[Christopher Eccleston]] (1964–): English stage, film, and television actor.&lt;ref&gt;"I'm an atheist. My mother is very religious, a churchgoer. She would often encourage me to go to church as well, but never forced it upon me, which I thought was quite decent of her. [...] There was no defining moment in which I decided there was no god for me, it was more of a growing process. I do feel that whatever religious beliefs I had as a child were foisted upon me. It's like when you ask where Grandma went when she died, and you'd be told that she went to heaven. I wouldn't necessarily view that as a bad thing, but it was stuff like that which I think hindered my intellectual development. Now that I've grown, I prefer a different interpretation."

"I can't argue with any of his morals on life," Ian says. "He believes in honesty, in not doing anybody any harm, and doing an honest day's work for an honest day's pay. "As far as those things go, I pretty much base him on my own values, but I swear, I drink booze and I'm an atheist, so I am different to Harold."

She knows she's being controversial, but she believes passionately in what she says, and passionately believes it needs saying. "I think that the Bible as a system of moral guidance in the 21st century is insufficient, to put it mildly,'' she continues, frowning a little.

Love is not rational, and yet it is what makes us live. On that level I feel very much that I'm living a life that is devoted to love, and that is a very spiritual existence in a way. But I absolutely believe that the power to discover, or not to discover, love is within us. We don't need any god for that. You could say I'm a spiritual atheist."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3548">'''Ludlul bēl nēmeqi''' ("''I Will Praise the Lord of Wisdom''"), also sometimes known in English as '''''The Poem of the Righteous Sufferer''''', is a [[Mesopotamian]] poem ([[Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament|ANET]], pp.&amp;nbsp;434–437) written in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] that concerns itself with the problem of the unjust suffering of an afflicted man, named [[Šubši-mašrâ-Šakkan|Shubshi-meshre-Shakkan]]. The author is tormented, but he doesn't know why. He has been faithful in all of his duties to the gods. He speculates that perhaps what is good to man is evil to the gods and vice versa. He is ultimately delivered from his sufferings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0684819139 John L. McKenzie, [[Dictionary of the Bible]], [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 1965 p. 440.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''megachurch''' is defined by the Hartford Institute as any [[Protestant]] [[Christianity|Christian]] church having 2,000 or more people in average weekend attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usachurches.org/church-sizes.htm|title=Church Sizes|author=|date=|website=www.USAChurches.org|access-date=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Biard"&gt;{{cite news

The concept originated in the mid 19th century, continued into the mid 20th century as a low-key phenomenon, and expanded rapidly through the 1980s and 1990s; it is widely seen across the US in the early 21st century. 
==History==
[[Image:NorthRidge church Plymouth Michigan.jpg|thumb|right|300px|NorthRidge megachurch [[Plymouth, Michigan]]]]
The origins of the megachurch movement, with a large number of local congregants who return on a weekly basis can be traced to the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt; Anne C. Loveland, Otis B.

Examples include [[Charles Spurgeon]]'s Baptist [[Metropolitan Tabernacle]] in London which attracted 5,000 weekly for years in the late 19th century, and [[televangelism|religious broadcaster]] [[Aimee Semple McPherson]]'s [[Angelus Temple]] in Los Angeles, of similar size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2136&amp;ResourceType=Building ''Angelus Temple''.] [[National Historic Landmarks Program]], NPS&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mehandipur Balaji Mandir''' ([[Hindi]]/[[Rajasthani language|Rajastani]]: मेहंदीपुर बालाजी मंदिर) is a noted Hindu temple, [[mandir]] in [[Dausa district]] of [[Rajasthan]], dedicated to the [[Hindu]] God [[Hanuman]]. The name ''Balaji'' is applied to Shri [[Hanuman]] in several parts of India because the childhood (''Bala'' in Hindi or [[Sanskrit]]) form of the Lord is especially celebrated there. The temple is dedicated to Balaji (another name for Shree Hanuman Ji). Unlike similar religious sites it is located in a town rather than the countryside. Its reputation for ritualistic healing and exorcism of evil spirits attracts many pilgrims from Rajasthan and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gold|1990|p=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kakar|1982|pp=53–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old village Mehandipur is located nearby the small hill. Old village is not well developed.

'''Mikveh''' or '''mikvah''' ({{Hebrew name|מִקְוֶה / מקווה|mikve|miqweh}}, {{abbr|pl.|Plural}}&amp;nbsp;''mikva'ot'', ''mikvoth'', ''mikvot'', or ([[Yiddish]]) ''mikves'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sivan|first=Reuven|author2=Edward A Levenston|title=The New Bantam-Megiddo Hebrew &amp; English dictionary|publisher=Bantam Books|location=Toronto; New York|year=1975|isbn=0-553-26387-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lauden|first=Edna|title=Multi Dictionary|publisher=Ad Publications|location=Tel Aviv|year=2006|isbn=965-390-003-X|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{abbr|lit.|Literally}}&amp;nbsp;"a collection") is a bath used for the purpose of [[ritual washing in Judaism#Full-body immersion|ritual immersion in Judaism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.religiousrules.com/Judaismpurity02general.htm |title=Concerning Ritual Purity and Cleanliness}}&lt;/ref&gt; to achieve [[Tumah and taharah|ritual purity]].

After the [[destruction of the Temple]], the mikveh's main uses remained as follows:
* by [[Jew]]ish women to achieve [[Niddah|ritual purity after menstruation and childbirth]] before they and their husbands may resume marital relations;
* by Jewish men to achieve ritual purity after ejaculation;
* as part of the traditional procedure for [[conversion to Judaism]];
* to immerse newly acquired utensils used in serving and eating food;
* to immerse a body as part of the preparation for burial (''[[Bereavement in Judaism#Preparing the body — Taharah|taharah]]'').

Most forms of impurity can be nullified through [[:wikt:immersion|immersion]] in any natural collection of water. However, some impurities, such as a [[zav]], require "living water",&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 15:13&lt;/ref&gt; such as springs or groundwater wells. Living water has the further advantage of being able to purify even while flowing, as opposed to rainwater which must be stationary in order to purify. The ''mikveh'' is designed to simplify this requirement, by providing a bathing facility that remains in ritual contact with a natural source of [[water]].

In [[Orthodox Judaism]], these regulations are steadfastly adhered to and, consequently, the mikveh is central to an Orthodox Jewish community; they formally hold in [[Conservative Judaism]] as well. The existence of a mikveh is considered so important that a Jewish community is required to construct a mikveh even before building a [[synagogue]], and must go to the extreme of selling [[Torah]] scrolls or even a synagogue if necessary, to provide funding for its construction.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Naftali Tzvi Yehuda Berlin, ''Meshiv Dabar'', 1:45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In the [[Hebrew Bible]], the word is employed in its broader sense but generally means a collection of water.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"&gt;{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia|title=MIḲWEH|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10827-mikweh|first1=Cyrus|last1=Adler|authorlink1=Cyrus Adler|first2=Julius H.|last2=Greenstone|authorlink2=|volume=8|page=588|accessdate=Feb 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
[[File:Mikva.jpg|thumb|250px|Excavated mikveh in [[Qumran]]]]
Before the beginning of the first century BCE, neither written sources, nor archaeology gives any indication about the existence of specific installations used for ritual cleansing.&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;{{cite web |title=Jewish Practices &amp; Rituals: Mikveh. History and Archaeology |author= |work=Encyclopaedia Judaica |publisher=Thomson Gale |date=2008 |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/mikveh.html |quote=Although water purification is referred to in the Old Testament, in regard to rituals and the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, with washing, sprinkling, and dipping in water, we do not hear of specific places or installations that people would constantly frequent for the purpose of ritually cleansing their flesh. The term mikveh was used in a very general sense in the Old Testament to refer to a body of water of indeterminate extent (cf. Gen. 1:10; Ex. 7:19), or more specifically to waters gathered from a spring or within a cistern (Lev. 11:36) or waters designated for a large reservoir situated in Jerusalem (Isa. 22:11). None of these places are mentioned as having been used for ritual purification in any way. Hence, the concept of the mikveh as a hewn cave or constructed purification pool attached to one's dwelling or place of work is undoubtedly a later one. |accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Manifest Identity: From ''Ioudaios'' to Jew: Household Judaism as Anti-Hellenization in the Late Hasmonean Era |series=Journal of Ancient Judaism.

==Requirements of a mikveh==
[[File:Modern mikveh.PNG|thumb|350px|Modern mikveh – schematic illustration]]
The traditional rules regarding the construction of a mikveh are based on those specified in [[classical rabbinical literature]]. According to these rules, a mikveh must be connected to a natural spring or well of naturally occurring water, and thus can be supplied by rivers and lakes which have natural springs as their source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|ספרא על ויקרא יא|[[Sifra]] on Leviticus 11:36|he}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cistern]] filled by the rain is also permitted to act as a mikveh's water supply. Similarly snow, ice and hail are allowed to act as the supply of water to a mikveh, as long as it melts in a certain manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|משנה מקואות ז א|[[Mikvaot]] 7:1|he}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A river that dries up on a regular basis cannot be used because it is presumed to be mainly rainwater, which cannot purify while flowing. Oceans for the most part have the status of natural springs.

A mikveh must, according to the classical regulations, contain enough water to cover the entire body of an average-sized person; based on a mikveh with the dimensions of 3 [[cubit]]s deep, 1 cubit wide, and 1 cubit long, the necessary volume of water was ''estimated'' as being 40 ''[[Seah (volume)|seah]]'' of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|עירובין ד ב|[[Erubin|Eruvin]] 4b|he}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|יומא לא א|[[Yoma]] 31a|he}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact volume referred to by a ''seah'' is debated, and classical rabbinical literature specifies only that it is enough to fit 144 eggs;&lt;ref&gt;[[Numbers Rabbah]], 18:17&lt;/ref&gt; most Orthodox Jews use the stringent ruling of the [[Avrohom Yeshaya Karelitz]], according to which one ''seah'' is 14.3 litres, and therefore a mikveh must contain approximately 575 [[litre]]s.&lt;ref&gt;about 3 [[Koku]], about 116 [[Maltese units of measurement|qafiz]], about 126 Imperial [[Gallons]], about 143 [[Burmese units of measurement|Burmese tins]], and about 150 U.S. liquid gallons&lt;/ref&gt; This volume of water could be topped up with water from any source,&lt;ref name="Mikvaot 3"&gt;{{cite wikisource|משנה מקואות ג|Mikvaot 3|he}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but if there were less than 40 seahs of water in the mikveh, then the addition of 3 or more [[pint]]s of water from an unnatural source would render the mikveh unfit for use, regardless of whether water from a natural source was then added to make up 40 seahs from a natural source; a mikveh rendered unfit for use in this way would need to be completely drained away and refilled from scratch in the prescribed way.&lt;ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia"/&gt;

Although not commonly accepted, at least one American Orthodox rabbi advocated a home mikvah using tap water. As water only flows through pipes open at both ends, the municipal and in-home plumbing would be construed as a non-vessel. So long as the pipes, hoses, and fittings were all freestanding and not held in the hand, it could be used to fill a mikvah receptacle that met all other requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hebrewbooks.org/2920|title=The Secret of the Jew: His Life, His Family / סוד נצח ישראל|last=מיללער|first=דוד|last2=Miller|website=|publisher=Rabbi David Miller|year=1930|isbn=|edition=Third|volume=Vol 1 / חלק א|location=127&amp;nbsp;Sheridan Rd, Oakland, CA|pages=|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also classical requirements for the manner in which the water can be stored and transported to the pool; the water must flow naturally to the mikveh from the source, which essentially means that it must be supplied by gravity or a natural pressure gradient, and the water cannot be pumped there by hand or carried. It was also forbidden for the water to pass through any vessel which could hold water within it (however pipes open to the air at both ends are fine)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|שולחן ערוך יורה דעה רא לו|Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 201:36|he}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Tap (valve)|tap]] water could not be used as the primary water source for a mikveh, although it can be used to top the water up to a suitable level.&lt;ref name="Mikvaot 3"/&gt; To avoid issues with these rules in large cities, various methods are employed to establish a valid mikveh. One is that tap water is made to flow over the top of a kosher mikveh, and through a conduit into a larger pool. A second method is to create a mikveh in a deep pool, place a floor with holes over that and then fill the upper pool with tap water. In this way, it is considered as if the person dipping is actually "in" the pool of rain water.

Most contemporary mikvoth are indoor constructions, involving rainwater collected from a cistern, and passed through a duct by gravity into an ordinary bathing pool; the mikveh can be heated, taking into account certain rules, often resulting in an environment not unlike a [[spa]].

A mikveh must be built into the ground or built as an essential part of a building. Portable receptacles, such as bathtubs, whirlpools or Jacuzzis, can therefore never function as mikvehs."&lt;ref name=NoJac&gt;{{cite web |title=The Mikvah |website=Chabad.org |url=https://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article_cdo/aid/1541/jewish/The-Mikvah.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for immersion in a Mikveh==

===Historic reasons===
[[File:Medieval mikveh old Synagoge Sopron Hungary.jpg|thumb|250px|Medieval Mikveh room in the old Synagogue of [[Sopron]], [[Hungary]], which dates to the 14th century]]
[[File:14440 The mikve in besalu.jpg|thumb|250px|A medieval mikveh in [[Besalú]], Spain]]
[[File:Mikveh inside house - Boskovice.jpg|thumb|250px|A mikveh from Boskovice in the Czech Republic]]
Traditionally, the mikveh was used by both men and women to regain ritual purity after various events, according to regulations laid down in the Torah and in classical rabbinical literature.

The Torah requires full immersion
* after [[Keri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|15:16|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; — normal emissions of semen, whether from [[sex|sexual activity]], or from [[nocturnal emission]]. Bathing in a ''mikveh'' due to Keri is required by the Torah in order that one should be allowed to consume from a [[heave offering]] or [[Korban|sacrifice]]; while [[Ezra]] instituted that one should also do so in order to be allowed to recite words of [[Torah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|בבא קמא פב ב|[[Bava Kamma]] 82b|he}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter case is known as ''tevilath Ezra'' ("the immersion of Ezra")
* after [[Zav]]/[[Zavah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|15:13|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; — abnormal discharges of body fluids
* after [[Tzaraath]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|14:6-9|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; — certain skin condition(s). These are termed ''lepra'' in the [[Septuagint]], and therefore traditionally translated into English as ''[[leprosy]]''; this is probably a translation error, as the Greek term ''lepra'' mostly refers to [[psoriasis]], and the Greek term for ''leprosy'' was ''elephas'' or ''elephantiasis''.
* by anyone who came into contact with someone suffering from Zav/Zavah, or into contact with someone still in [[Niddah]] (normal [[menstruation]]), or who comes into contact with articles that have been used or sat upon by such persons&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|15:5-10|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|15:19-27|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* by a [[Kohen]] who is being [[consecration|consecrated]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|29:4|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Exodus|40:12|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* by the [[Kohen Gadol]] on [[Yom Kippur]], after sending away the goat to [[Azazel]], and by the man who leads away the goat&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:24|}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|16:26|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|16:28|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* by the Kohen who performed the [[Red Heifer]] ritual&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|19:7-8|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* after contact with a [[corpse]] or [[grave (burial)|grave]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|19:19|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to having the ashes of the [[Red heifer]] ritual sprinkled upon them
* after eating [[meat]] from an [[carrion|animal that died naturally]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|17:15|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical rabbinical writers conflated the rules for zavah and niddah. It also became customary for Kohanim to fully immerse themselves before [[Jewish holidays]], and the [[laity]] of many communities subsequently adopted this practice. Converts to Judaism are required to undergo full immersion in water.

===In Modern Judaism===
Some Jewish [[funeral home]]s have a mikveh for immersing a body during the purification procedure (''[[Bereavement in Judaism#Preparing the body — Taharah|taharah]]'') before burial.

====Orthodox Judaism====
Orthodox Judaism generally adheres to the classical regulations and traditions, and consequently Orthodox Jewish women are obligated to immerse in a mikveh between [[Niddah]] and sexual relations with their husbands. This includes brides before their [[Chuppah|marriage]], and married women after their menstruation period or childbirth. In accordance with [[tzniut|Orthodox rules concerning modesty]], men and women are required to immerse in separate mikveh facilities in separate locations, or to use the mikveh at different designated times. 

[[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Orthodox Judaism]], regardless of gender, are also required to immerse in a mikveh. 

It is customary for Orthodox Jews to immerse before Yom Kippur,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Shulchan Aruch'', Orach Chayim, 581:4 and 606:4&lt;/ref&gt; and married women sometimes do so as well. In the [[minhag|customs of certain Jewish communities]], men also use a mikveh before Jewish holidays;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; the men in certain communities, especially [[hasidic]] and [[Haredi Judaism|haredi]] groups, also practice immersion before each [[Shabbat]], and some immerse in a mikveh every single day. Although the [[Temple Mount]] is treated by many Orthodox Jewish authorities as being forbidden territory, a small number of groups permit access, but require immersion before ascending the Mount as a precaution.

Orthodox Judaism requires that vessels and utensils must be immersed in a mikveh before being used for food, if purchased or received from a non-Jew.

=====Obligatory immersion in Orthodox Judaism=====
Immersion in a mikveh is obligatory in contemporary [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] practice in the following circumstances:
* Women
** Following the ''[[niddah]]'' period after menstruation, prior to resuming [[sexual intercourse|marital relations]]
** Following the ''[[niddah]]'' period after childbirth, prior to resuming marital relations
** By a bride, before her wedding
* Either gender
** As part of a [[conversion to Judaism]]
* Immersion of utensils acquired from a gentile

=====Customary immersion in Orthodox Judaism=====
Immersion in a mikveh is customary in contemporary [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] practice in the following circumstances:
* Men
** By a bridegroom, on the day of his wedding, according to the custom of some communities
** By a father, prior to the [[bris|circumcision]] of his son, according to the custom of some communities{{Which|date=October 2010}}
** By a [[kohen]] prior to a service in which he will recite the [[priestly blessing]], according to the custom of some communities
** Before Yom Kippur, according to the custom of some communities
** Before a [[Jewish holiday]], according to the [[minhag|custom]] of some communities
** Weekly before [[Shabbat]], under [[Hasidic]] and [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] customs
** Every day, under [[Hasidic]] [[minhag|customs]]
Immersion for men is more common in [[Hasidic]] communities, and non-existent in others, like [[German Jewish]] communities.

=====Recent Orthodox writings=====
Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]] in ''Waters of Eden''&lt;ref&gt;''Waters of Eden'' by Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]]. {{ISBN|978-1-879016-08-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; connects the laws of impurity to the narrative in the beginning of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. According to Genesis, by eating of the fruit, Adam and Eve had brought death into the world. Kaplan points out that most of the laws of impurity relate to some form of death (or in the case of Niddah the loss of a potential life). One who comes into contact with one of the forms of death must then immerse in water which is described in Genesis as flowing out of the Garden of Eden (the source of life) in order to cleanse oneself of this contact with death (and by extension of sin).

Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] offered an additional message for mikveh.

By immersing ourselves in water, "we are forced to recognize our existential estrangement from the physical universe. How long can we survive under water? The experience of submerging drives home the realization that our existence in this world is transient, and we should strive towards more lasting goals." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morrison |first1=Chanan |last2=Kook |first2=Abraham Isaac Kook|title=Gold from the Land of Israel: A New Light on the Weekly Torah Portion - From the Writings of Rabbi Abraham Isaac HaKohen Kook' |date=2006 |publisher=Urim Publications |isbn=965-7108-92-6 |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conservative Judaism====
[[File:MikvehAJU.jpg|thumb|250px|The mikveh at the [[American Jewish University]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]]]

In a series of responsa on the subject of [[Niddah]] in December 2006, the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] of [[Conservative Judaism]] reaffirmed a requirement that Conservative women use a mikveh monthly following the end of the [[niddah]] period following [[menstruation]], while adapting certain leniencies including reducing the length of the nidda period. The three responsa adapted permit a range of approaches from an opinion reaffirming the traditional ritual to an opinion declaring the concept of ritual purity does not apply outside the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], proposing a new theological basis for the ritual, adapting new terminology including renaming the observances related to menstruation from ''taharat hamishpacha'' [[family purity]] to ''kedushat hamishpaha'' [family holiness] to reflect the view that the concept of [[tamei|ritual purity]] is no longer considered applicable, and adopting certain leniencies including reducing the length of the niddah period.&lt;ref name="RabbiIntro"&gt;[http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Mikveh_Introduction.doc Rabbi [[Miriam Berkowitz]], Mikveh and the Sanctity of Family Relations, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320161101/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Mikveh_Introduction.doc |date=March 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RabbiGrossman"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080407061730/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Grossman-Niddah.pdf Rabbi Susan Grossman, MIKVEH AND THE SANCTITY OF BEING CREATED HUMAN, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RabbiReisner"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080407061721/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Reisner-Niddah.pdf Rabbi Avram Reisner, OBSERVING NIDDAH IN OUR DAY: AN INQUIRY ON THE STATUS OF PURITY AND THE PROHIBITION OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY WITH A MENSTRUANT, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RabbiBerkowitz"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090320161047/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/docs/Berkowitz-Niddah.pdf Rabbi [[Miriam Berkowitz]], RESHAPING THE LAWS OF FAMILY PURITY FOR THE MODERN WORLD, Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, Rabbinical Assembly, December 6, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Klein]]'s ''A Guide to Jewish Religious Practice'', a comprehensive guide frequently used within Conservative Judaism also addresses Conservative views on other uses of a mikveh, but because it predates the 2006 opinions it describes an approach more closely resembling the Orthodox one and does not address the leniencies and views those opinions reflected. Rabbi [[Miriam Berkowitz]]'s recent book ''Taking the Plunge: A Practical and Spiritual Guide to the Mikveh'' (Jerusalem: Schechter Institute, 2007) offers a comprehensive discussion of contemporary issues and new mikveh uses along with traditional reasons for observance, details of how to prepare and what to expect, and how the laws developed. Conservative Judaism encourages but does not require immersion before Jewish Holidays (including Yom Kippur), nor the immersion of utensils purchased from non-Jews. New uses are being developed throughout the liberal world for healing (after rape, incest, divorce etc.) or celebration (milestone birthdays, anniversaries, ordination, or reading Torah for the first time).

As in Orthodox Judaism, converts to Judaism through the Conservative movement are required to immerse themselves in a mikveh. Two Jews must witness the event, at least one of which must actually see the immersion. Immersion into a mikveh has been described as a very emotional, life-changing experience similar to a graduation.&lt;ref&gt;Freudenheim, Susan. [http://www.jewishjournal.com/cover_story/article/becoming_jewish_tales_from_the_mikveh "Becoming Jewish: Tales from the Mikveh."] ''Jewish Journal''. 8 May 2013. 8 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism====
[[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] do not hold the [[Halakha|halachic]] requirements of mikveh the way Orthodox Judaism does. However, there are growing trends toward using mikveh for conversions, wedding preparation, and even before holidays.&lt;ref name="Reform Mikveh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reformjudaismmag.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=1387 |title=Sue Fishkoff, Reimagining the Mikveh, Reform Judaism Magazine, Fall 2008 |publisher=Reformjudaismmag.org |accessdate=2012-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122065116/http://reformjudaismmag.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=1387 |archivedate=2012-11-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century the mikveh is experiencing a revival among progressive Jews who view immersion as a way to mark transitions in their lives. "Open" mikvoth welcome Jews to consider immersion for reasons not necessarily required by Jewish law; they might immerse following a divorce or medical treatment, to find closure after an abortion, or to celebrate a life transition, among other reasons. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/what-is-the-mikvah-all-about/2014/11/07/cdff0784-6696-11e4-836c-83bc4f26eb67_story.html What is the mikvah all about?] The Washington Post, Nov 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Progressive Jews may also use the mikveh for conversion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/109120/the-new-american-mikveh the New American Mikveh] Tablet Magazine, Aug 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements during use of a mikveh==
There is supposed to be no barrier between the person immersing and the water. The person should be wearing no clothes, jewelry, makeup, nail polish, fake nails, or grooming products on the hair or skin. For more observant Jewish women, an attendant will assure these requirements are met.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/what-is-the-mikvah-all-about/2014/11/07/cdff0784-6696-11e4-836c-83bc4f26eb67_story.html What is the mikvah all about?] ''The Washington Post'', November 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Showering or bathing and carefully checking the whole body is therefore part of the religious requirements before entering the water of a Mikveh for a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://dinonline.org/2015/12/29/shower-before-mikvah |title=Shower before Mivah |quote=If the entire bathing process is not being done in the mikvah, common custom is to take another quick shower and comb out the hair before the tevila}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hair===
According to rabbinical tradition, the hair counts as part of the body, and therefore water is required to touch all parts of it, meaning that braids cannot be worn during immersion; this has resulted in debate between the various [[ethnicity|ethnic groups]] within Judaism, about whether hair combing is necessary before immersion. The [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] community generally supports the view that hair must be combed straight so that there are no knots, but some take issue with this stance, particularly when it comes to [[dreadlocks]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} A number of rabbinical rulings argue in support of dreadlocks, on the basis that
* dreadlocks can sometimes be loose enough to become thoroughly saturated with water, particularly if the person had first showered
* combing dreadlocked hair can be painful
* although a particularly cautious individual would consider a single knotted hair as an obstruction, in most cases hair is loose enough for water to pass through it, unless each hair is individually knotted&lt;ref name=Kitzure&gt;Kolel Menachem, ''Kitzur Dinei Taharah: A Digest of the Niddah Laws Following the Rulings of the [[Rebbe]]s of [[Chabad-Lubavitch|Chabad]]'' (Brooklyn, New York: Kehot Publication Society, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegorical uses of the term mikveh==
The word ''mikveh'' makes use of the same root letters in Hebrew as the word for "hope" and this has served as the basis for homiletical comparison of the two concepts in both biblical and rabbinic literature. For instance, in the [[Book of Jeremiah]], the word ''mikveh'' is used in the sense of "hope," but at the same time also associated with "living water":
{{Quote |O Hashem, the Hope [mikveh] of Israel, all who forsake you will be ashamed... because they have forsaken Hashem, the fountain of living water&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Jeremiah|17:13|}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{Quote |Are there any of the worthless idols of the nations, that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? Is it not you, Hashem our God, and do we not hope [nekaveh] in you? For you have made all these things.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse ||Jeremiah|14:22|}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the [[Mishnah]], following on from a discussion about Yom Kippur, immersion in a Mikveh is compared by [[Rabbi Akiva]] with the relationship between God and Israel. Akiva refers to the description of God in the Book of Jeremiah as the "Mikveh of Israel", and suggests that "just as a mikveh purifies the contaminated, so does the Holy One, blessed is he, purify Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|יומא פה ב|[[Yoma]] 85b|he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different allegory is used by many Jews adhering to a belief in [[resurrection]] as one of the [[Thirteen Principles of Faith]]. Since "living water" in a lifeless frozen state (as [[ice]]) is still likely to again become living water (after [[melting]]), it became customary in traditional [[Bereavement in Judaism|Jewish bereavement rituals]] to read the seventh chapter of the [[Mikvaot]] tractate in the Mishnah, following a funeral; the Mikvaot tractate covers the laws of the mikveh, and the seventh chapter starts with a discussion of substances which can be used as valid water sources for a mikveh – snow, hail, frost, ice, salt, and pourable [[mud]].

==Controversies==

===Use by Reform and Conservative converts===
The Reform Movement’s [[Israel Religious Action Center]] sued the state on behalf of the Reform and Conservative/Masorti movements to allow members to use publicly funded mikvoth. The case, which took ten years to resolve, resulted in the Israeli Supreme Court ruling that public ritual baths must accept all prospective converts to Judaism, including converts to  Reform and Conservative Judaism. In his 2016 ruling, Supreme Court Justice [[Elyakim Rubinstein]] said barring certain converts amounts to discrimination. Until this ruling Orthodox officials barred non-Orthodox converts from using any mikveh, claiming their traditions do not conform to Jewish law and the people they convert are therefore not Jews. Rubinstein noted: "Once it established public mikvahs and put them at the service of the public — including for the process of conversion — the State cannot but be evenhanded in allowing their use," Rubenstein said. "The State of Israel is free to supervise the use of its mikvahs, so long as it does so in an egalitarian manner."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religionnews.com/2016/02/14/israels-supreme-court-public-ritual-baths-must-accept-non-orthodox/ Israel’s Supreme Court: Public ritual baths must accept non-Orthodox, too] Religion news, Feb 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intrusive questions===
In 2013 the Israeli [[Center for Women's Justice]] and Kolech, an organization committed to [[Orthodox Jewish feminism]], petitioned the Supreme Court to forbid attendants from asking intrusive questions of women at state-funded and operated mikvot. In response, the Chief Rabbinate said it would forbid questioning of women about their marital status before immersion. The complaint had charged that the practice represented unacceptable discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/routine-emergencies/don-t-ask-don-t-tell-the-new-mikveh-policy.premium-1.523291 Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell; - the New Mikveh Policy] haaretz, May 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015, however, the ITIM Advocacy Center filed a complaint with the Israeli Supreme Court on behalf of 13 Orthodox women against the [[Chief Rabbinate]] and the [[Jerusalem Religious Council]], insisting that women be allowed to use the mikvah "according to their personal customs and without supervision or with their own attendant if they wish". The complaint charged that Chief Rabbinate is ignoring directives passed in 2013 that allow women to use the mikvah facilities without being asked intrusive questions by attendants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-ngo-asks-supreme-court-to-protect-womens-rights-at-mikvah/ Israeli NGO asks Supreme Court to protect women’s rights at mikvah] Times of Israel, July 20, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, the Chief Rabbinate agreed to allow women to use a mikveh without an attendant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.726574/ Israeli Women to Be Allowed to Bathe in Mikvehs Without an Attendant] Haaretz, June 23,

[[File:MuezzinMahfili.jpg|thumb|320px|The '''''müezzin mahfili''''' in the [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]]]
The '''''müezzin mahfili''''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]), or in [[Arabic]] known as '''مكبرية''' (''Mukabariyah'') is a special raised platform in a [[mosque]], opposite to the [[minbar]], where the [[muezzin]] carries out his duties to [[Adhan|call for prayer]] and chants in response to the [[imam]]'s prayers.

Not all mosques have this as it is not a mandatory requirement for a mosque. In mosques without a ''müezzin mahfili'', the muezzin calls for prayer and does his duties behind to place of the imam beside with other worshippers. 

Mosques which have a ''muezzin mehfili'' include the grand mosque in Mecca ([[Masjid al Haram]]) and [[Masjid Nabawi]]. The [[Hagia Sophia]] in Istanbul (pictured) was built as a Christian church but was converted to a mosque when the city was conquered by the Turks. A ''müezzin mahfili'' was added.

'''''Panaeolus olivaceus''''' is a widely distributed, seldom identified, little brown mushroom that contains the hallucinogen [[psilocybin]]; it is often mistaken for ''[[Panaeolina foenisecii]]'' and is distinguished by its black [[spore print]] and darker [[lamella (mycology)|gill]] coloration when mature alongside a slightly thicker [[stipe (mycology)|stem]].  It is even more easily mistaken for ''[[Panaeolus cinctulus]]'' or ''[[Panaeolus fimicola]]'' and can be distinguished from them both by its slightly roughened spores. It is also easily confused with ''[[Panaeolina castaneifolia]]'', a species which has [[spore]]s that are dark brown and significantly more roughened.

== Description ==
*'''Cap''': 1— 3(4) cm across, Distinctly campanulate then subhemispheric to convex, becoming broadly conic, not fully expanding, incurved margin when young, dark smoky-grayish to dark cinnamon, drying to a straw-yellow or slightly olive-gray color, remaining more reddish-brown towards the center, hygrophanous, smooth, sometimes striated or finely corrugated, flesh thick and firm.
*'''Gills''': Adnate to adnexed, close, thin, pallid, mottled, slightly olive-greenish, becoming dark purplish gray-black in age, edge whitish.
*'''Stipe''': 4— 6(7.5) cm by 3— 4(6) mm thick, equal to slightly tapering at the base, hollow, brittle, [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] and slightly striate, no veil remnants. Grayish to ochraceous, tan or purple at the base.
*'''Spores''': Black, slightly roughened, 12 —  15(17) x 7 —  8.5(10) micrometers, elliptic, rugose or verrucose.
*'''Microscopic features''': Basidia 24 —  28 x 10 - 12 micrometers. Cheilocystidia (20)24— 30(38) x (5)7 —  10 micrometers, abundant, neck often flexuous and apices usually obtuse, thin walled and hyaline, pleurocystidia rare or absent, not projecting beyond plane of basidia.

==Habitat and formation==
''Panaeolus olivaceus'' grows scattered to gregariously in rich grassy areas, from late summer through December, across North and South America, likely more widely distributed; it has been collected in the U.S. states of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], [[Florida (U.S. state)|Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Canada]]'s [[Quebec]] and in the [[United Kingdom]].

Phil Zuckerman's 2008 book ''Society without God'' notes that Denmark and [[Sweden]], "probably the least religious countries in the world, and possibly in the history of the world", enjoy "among the lowest violent crime rates in the world [and] the lowest levels of corruption in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Society Without God: What the Least Religious Nations Can Tell Us about Contentment|edition= |last= Zuckerman|first= Phil|publisher= New York University Press|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-8147-9714-3|page= 2}} Zuckerman's work is based on his studies conducted during a 14-month period in Scandinavia in 2005–2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckerman identifies that Scandinavians have "relatively high rates of petty crime and burglary", but "their overall rates of violent crime—such as murder, aggravated assault, and rape—are among the lowest on earth".&lt;ref&gt;(Zuckerman 2008, pp. 5–6)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, ''New York Times'' columnist [[Peter Steinfels]] commented that ''Society Without God'' provides evidence that an irreligious society can flourish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/us/28beliefs.html?pagewanted=all&amp;pagew&amp;_r=0|title=Scandinavian Nonbelievers, Which Is Not to Say Atheists|author=Peter Steinfels|date=February 27, 2009|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Society Without God'' won a “Book of the Year Silver Award” by ''Foreword Magazine'' in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4286013-society-without-god|title=Society Without God|website=Goodreads|access-date=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was featured in ''The'' ''New York Times'' in an article by Peter Steinfel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/us/28beliefs.html|title=Scandinavian Nonbelievers, Which Is Not to Say Atheists|last=Steinfels|first=Peter|date=2009-02-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public commentary===
Zuckerman has said that 20 percent of the United States are irreligious and 30 percent of citizens under 30 are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/01/07/260184473/sunday-assembly-a-church-for-the-godless-picks-up-steam|title=Sunday Assembly: A Church For The Godless Picks Up Steam|author=Mandalit del Barco|date=January 7, 2014|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckerman has commented that religion is often conflated with patriotism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/10/atheist-mega-churches/3489967/|title=Atheist 'mega-churches' look for nonbelievers|work=USA Today|date=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated that while "he applauds the passion and purpose" of [[American Atheists]], they are a minority, as the majority of atheists in America "are not angry, do not hate religion and do not need a forum to vent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2013-03/american-atheists-wrestles-its-cherished-grumpy-image|title=American Atheists wrestles with its cherished 'grumpy' image|author=Kimberly Winston|date=Mar 31, 2013|publisher=[[The Christian Century]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuckerman has found that murder rates in Scandinavian countries lowered after abolishing the [[death penalty]], and has opposed the use in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claremontportside.com/print-edition/2013-2014/may-2014/democracy-and-the-death-penalty/|title=Democracy and the Death Penalty|author=Jess Davis|date=May 7, 2014|work=Claremont Portside|publisher=Generation Progress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuckerman has found that the religiously unaffiliated tend to be more inclined to [[progressive politics]], and the decline in Protestant Christianity in America is a blow to conservative causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/10/us/study-finds-that-percentage-of-protestant-americans-is-declining.html|title=Percentage of Protestant Americans Is in Steep Decline, Study Finds|author=LAURIE GOODSTEIN|date=October 9, 2012|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckerman has commented on the rise of [[Jewish atheism|secular Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/rise-of-jews-of-no-religion-most-significant-find-of-pew-study-says-director/|title=Rise of 'Jews of no religion' most significant find of Pew study, says director|work=The Times of Israel|last=Zehavi|first=Ben|date=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuckerman commented that growing atheist movements in the United States were a response to the impact of the [[Christian right]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-06-16/news/ct-met-church-cta-bus-ad-20100616_1_freedom-from-religion-foundation-freethinkers-ariela-keysar|title=Secularists spreading the word|date=June 16, 2010|author=Manya A.

'''Philip Carr-Gomm''' (born 1952) is an [[author]] in the fields of [[psychology]] and [[Neo-druidism|Druidry]], a psychologist, and one of the leaders and Chosen Chief of The [[Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids]].

==Biography==
Philip Carr-Gomm was born in London, raised in [[Notting Hill Gate]], and educated at [[Westminster School]] and [[University College London]]. His father was Francis Eardley Carr-Gomm,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geneagraphie.com/getperson.php?personID=I630368&lt;/ref&gt; brother of humanitarian [[Richard Carr-Gomm]].

He met his first spiritual teacher, [[Ross Nichols]], the founder of The [[Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids]], when he was 11. He began studying with him when a teenager, and joined the Order when he was 18. He studied meditation with Olivia Robertson&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/fellowshipofisiscentral/fellowship-of-isis---the-first-rituals Fellowship of Isis]&lt;/ref&gt; in Ireland, who later founded the [[Fellowship of Isis]], and in his twenties he founded The Esoteric Society in London, which organised journeys for members to [[Bulgaria]] and [[Egypt]], and hosted talks by well-known authors such as [[Gareth Knight]], [[W. E. Butler]], and [[Arthur Guirdham]].

In 1975 Nichols died, and Carr-Gomm followed a Bulgarian teacher, [[Omraam Mikhael Aivanhov]] for seven years, giving talks on his teachings and helping with the translation and publishing of his books into English. He also travelled to Bulgaria and studied the work of Aivanhov's teacher, [[Peter Deunov]], visiting [[Sofia]] annually for fourteen years, teaching Deunov's Paneurhythmy dance in England and at [[Findhorn]] in Scotland. In his thirties he turned to a study of psychology, taking a BSc degree at [[University College London]] and [[Jungian analysis]], with plans to become an analyst. On discovering [[Psychosynthesis]], he trained instead as a therapist at the Institute of Psychosynthesis in London and began a private practice.

In 1988 he was asked to lead the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids.&lt;ref&gt;[[OBOD|OBOD website]]&lt;/ref&gt; He organised the Order's teachings into a [[distance-learning]] course, and edited Nichols' ''Book of Druidry'' with [[John and Caitlin Matthews|John Matthews]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross Nichols, ''The Book of Druidry'', HarperCollins 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, the Order has grown to become the largest Druid teaching order in the world, with Professor of History [[Ronald Hutton]] writing that 'the OBOD correspondence course arguably represents one of the major documents of British spirituality from the late twentieth century'.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Ronald, 'The Druids",p.196, Hambledon Continuum, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Druidcraft==
''Druidcraft'' is a spiritual practice embracing elements of both [[Neo-druidism|Druidry]] and [[Wicca]], developed by Philip Carr-Gomm, and is also the title of a book he wrote about the same topic. That book deals with the combination of druidry and wicca in a new, combined practice. Within this book, Carr-Gomm claims that the differences between Wicca and Druidry do not stem from hundreds or thousands of years worth of tradition as these two distinct paths evolved separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carr-Gomm|first1=Philip|title=Druidcraft : the magic of Wicca and Druidry|date=2002|publisher=Thorsons|location=London|isbn=0-00-713388-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that in fact the differences between modern Wicca and Druidism are due to the differences between two friends, [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] and [[Ross Nichols]] who were deeply involved with these paths less than 75 years ago.

'''Pierre de Jarric''' (1566 – 2 March 1617) was a [[French people|French]] Catholic [[missionary]] writer from [[Toulouse]].

Jarric entered the [[Society of Jesus]] on 8 December 1582 and taught [[philosophy]] and moral [[theology]] at [[Bordeaux]] for many years. Although he desired to join the missionaries of his order, his wish was not fulfilled. Instead, he dedicated himself to writing on their behalf.  The result was ''Histoire des choses plus memorables advenues tant ez Indes orientales, que autres païs de la descouverte des Portugois'', which appeared in three parts:  the second of which appeared in 1610 and the third in 1614.

Jarric's work gives a comprehensive picture of the missionary enterprises of the [[Jesuits]] up to 1610, chiefly within the sphere of Portuguese interests. It contains much valuable data on colonial history, [[geography]], and [[ethnography]], taken from [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] reports, and from the works of Father [[Luis de Guzman]] (''Hist. de las Missiones que han hecho los religiosos de la Compañia de Jesús''), and of Father [[Ferdinand Guerreiro]] (''Relação Annal das cousas que fizeram os Padres da companhia de Jesus na India e Japão, Brazil, Angola, Cabo Verde, Guiné''). By dedicating the second part to King [[Louis XIII]], Jarric hoped to encourage the French king to imitate Spain and Portugal in their [[colonization]] efforts. His work was frequently reprinted and widely circulated, particularly after it was translated into [[Latin]] by Martino Martinez III around 1615.  Jarric died in [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]] two years later.

'''Pope Benedict XVI''' ({{lang-la|Benedictus XVI}}; {{lang-it|Benedetto XVI}}; {{lang-de|Benedikt XVI}}; born '''Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger'''; {{IPA-de|ˈjoːzɛf ˈalɔʏzi̯ʊs ˈʁatsɪŋɐ}}; 16 April 1927) served as [[Pope]] and sovereign of the [[Vatican City]] State from 2005 until [[Resignation of Pope Benedict XVI|his resignation]] in 2013. Benedict's election occurred in the [[papal conclave, 2005|2005 papal conclave]] that followed the death of [[Pope John Paul II]]. The Vatican announced his withdrawal by bestowing him the title [[Papal renunciation|Pope Emeritus]] shortly after his resignation.&lt;ref name="pope emeritus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pope emeritus ncr"&gt;{{cite web | title=Benedict's New Name: Pope Emeritus, His Holiness Benedict XVI, Roman Pontiff Emeritus | url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/benedicts-new-name-pope-emeritus-his-holiness-benedict-xvi-roman-pontiff-em | date=26 Feb 2013 | accessdate=2018-06-23 | first=Edward | last=Petin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ordained as a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] in 1951 in his native [[Bavaria]], Ratzinger had established himself as a highly regarded university theologian by the late 1950s and was appointed a full professor in 1958. After a long career as an academic and professor of theology at several German universities, he was appointed [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Archbishop of Munich and Freising]] and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1977, an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience. In 1981, he was appointed Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], one of the most important [[dicasteries]] of the [[Roman Curia]]. From 2002 until his election as Pope, he was also [[Dean of the College of Cardinals]]. Prior to becoming Pope, he was "a major figure on the [[Holy See|Vatican]] stage for a quarter of a century"; he had an influence "second to none when it came to setting church priorities and directions" as one of John Paul II's closest confidants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Walsh |first1= Mary Ann |authorlink1=  |title= From Pope John Paul II to Benedict XVI: an inside look at the end of an era, the beginning of a new one, and the future of the church |year= 2005 |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn= 1-58051-202-X |oclc= |page= 135}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has lived in Rome since 1981.

He was originally a liberal theologian, but adopted conservative views after 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/disillusioned-german-catholics-the-pope-s-difficult-visit-to-his-homeland-a-787314-2.html |title=Disillusioned German Catholics: From Liberal to Conservative|work=[[Der Spiegel]] |accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His prolific&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4079549.ece |title=Vatican to publish entire work by bestselling author Pope Benedict XVI |work=The Times |location=London |date=6 June 2008 |accessdate=6 May 2009 |first=Richard |last=Owen |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62DpGr7r9?url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4079549.ece |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; writings defend traditional Catholic doctrine and values. During his papacy, Benedict XVI advocated a return to fundamental [[Christian values]] to counter the increased [[secularism|secularisation]] of many [[Western world|Western countries]]. He views [[relativism]]'s denial of [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective truth]], and the denial of [[Moral relativism|moral truths]] in particular, as the central problem of the 21st century. He taught the importance of both the Catholic Church and an understanding of God's redemptive love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,635185276,00.html |title=Benedict's encyclical offers hope for world |work=[[Deseret News]] |first=Jerry Earl |last=Johnston |date=18 February 2006 |accessdate=12 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092429/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1%2C5143%2C635185276%2C00.html |archivedate= 2 April 2015 |df= }} [https://www.webcitation.org/62DpkqLxB?url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/635185276/Benedicts-encyclical-offers-hope-for-world.html WebCitation archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Benedict also revived a number of traditions, including elevating the [[Tridentine Mass]] to a more prominent position.&lt;ref&gt;Gledhill, Ruth [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article667813.ece "Pope set to bring back Latin Mass that divided the Church"] ''The Times'' 11 October 2006.

On 11 February 2013, Benedict unexpectedly announced his resignation in a speech in Latin before the cardinals, citing a "lack of strength of mind and body" due to his advanced age. [[Resignation of Pope Benedict XVI|His resignation]] became effective on 28 February 2013. He is the first Pope to resign since [[Pope Gregory XII]] in 1415, and the first to do so on his own initiative since [[Pope Celestine V]] in 1294. As Pope Emeritus, Benedict retains the [[style (manner of address)|style]] of [[His Holiness]], and the title of Pope, and continues to dress in the papal colour of white. He was succeeded by [[Pope Francis]] on 13 March 2013, and he moved into the newly renovated monastery [[Mater Ecclesiae Monastery (Vatican City)|''Mater Ecclesiae'']] for his retirement on 2 May 2013. In his retirement, Benedict XVI has made occasional public appearances alongside Pope Francis.

&lt;!-- Due to the size of the overall article, please consider whether it would be more appropriate to add any additional information to the larger article on the early life of Pope Benedict XVI rather than this one. --&gt;
Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger was born on 16 April, [[Holy Saturday]], 1927, at Schulstraße 11, at 8:30 in the morning in his parents' home in Marktl, Bavaria, Germany. He was baptised the same day. He is the third and youngest child of [[Joseph Ratzinger, Sr.]], a police officer, and Maria Ratzinger (née Peintner); his grand-uncle was the German priest-politician [[Georg Ratzinger (politician)|Georg Ratzinger]]. His mother's family was originally from [[South Tyrol]] (now in Italy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/articolo.asp?c=536395 |title=Vatican Radio – Pope Benedict: proud to be part of Tyrol a "land made by Angels" |publisher=En.radiovaticana.va |date=9 November 2011 |accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Benedict's elder brother, [[Georg Ratzinger]], is a Catholic priest and is the former director of the [[Regensburger Domspatzen]] choir. His sister, Maria Ratzinger, who never married, managed Cardinal Ratzinger's household until her death in 1991.

At the age of five, Ratzinger was in a group of children who welcomed the visiting [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Cardinal Archbishop of Munich]], [[Michael von Faulhaber]], with flowers. Struck by the cardinal's distinctive garb, he announced later that day that he wanted to be a cardinal. He attended the elementary school in [[Aschau am Inn]], which was renamed in his honour in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Ratzinger's family, especially his father, bitterly resented the [[Nazis]], and his father's opposition to Nazism resulted in demotions and harassment of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/22/international/worldspecial2/22germany.html?pagewanted=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1114340564-13zVUfWUfsfMLXhqWFxrDA&amp;_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first1=Mark | last1=Landler | first2=Richard | last2=Bernstein | title=A Future Pope Is Recalled: A Lover of Cats and Mozart, Dazzled by Church as a Boy | date=22 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his 14th birthday in 1941, Ratzinger was conscripted into the [[Hitler Youth]]—as membership was required by law for all 14-year-old German boys after March 1939&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verfassungen.de/de/de33-45/hitlerjugend36.htm Zweite Durchführungsverordnung zum Gesetz über die Hitler-Jugend (Jugenddienstverordnung) vom 25.

Ratzinger and his brother Georg entered Saint Michael Seminary in Traunstein in November 1945, later studying at the [[Ducal Georgianum]] (''Herzogliches Georgianum'') of the [[Ludwig-Maximilian University]] in Munich. They were both ordained in [[Freising]] on 29 June 1951 by Cardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] of Munich. Ratzinger recalled: "at the moment the elderly Archbishop laid his hands on me, a little bird – perhaps a lark – flew up from the altar in the high cathedral and trilled a little joyful song."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Milestones: Memoirs 1927–1977 | page=99 | publisher=[[Ignatius Press]]| year=1998 |language=German| isbn=978-0-89870-702-1 | author=Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger |author2=Erasmo Leiva-Merikakis (translator)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratzinger's 1953 dissertation was on [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and was titled ''The People and the House of God in Augustine's Doctrine of the Church''. His [[habilitation]] (which qualified him for a professorship) was on [[Bonaventure]]. It was completed in 1957 and he became a professor of Freising College in 1958.

=== Encounter with Romano Guardini ===
In his early twenties, he was deeply influenced by the thought of Italian German [[Romano Guardini]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=8547 ''"Ratzinger and Guardini, a Decisive Encounter"''] essay by Silvano Zucal in ''Vita E Pensiero'' Publisher Catholic University of Milan, October 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; who taught in Munich 1946 to 1951 when Ratzinger was studying in Freising and later at the University of Munich. The intellectual affinity between these two thinkers, who would later become decisive figures for the twentieth-century Church, was preoccupied with rediscovering the essential in Christianity.  Guardini with his 1938 tome "The Essence of Christianity," while Ratzinger penned "Introduction to Christianity,"  three decades later in 1968. Guardini inspired many in the Catholic social-democratic tradition, particularly the Communion and Liberation movement in the ''New Evangelization'' encouraged under the papacy of Polish Pope John Paul II. At the close of the twentieth the future Cardinal Ratzinger would write an introduction to a 1996 reissue of Guardini's 1954 classic "[[The Lord (book)|The Lord]]".&lt;ref&gt;''"[[The Lord (book)|The Lord]]"'' [https://www.amazon.com/Lord-None-Romano-Guardini/dp/0895267144 by Roman Guardini, 1996, reprint of 1954 first English translation] Regnery Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic career: 1951–1977===
{{Ratzinger}}
{{Catholic philosophy}}
Ratzinger became a professor at the [[University of Bonn]] in 1959, his inaugural lecture was on "The God of Faith and the God of Philosophy". In 1963, he moved to the [[University of Münster]]. During this period, he participated in the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–65) and served as a ''[[peritus]]'' (theological consultant) to [[Josef Frings|Cardinal Frings of Cologne]]. He was viewed during the time of the Council as a reformer, cooperating with theologians like [[Hans Küng]] and [[Edward Schillebeeckx]]. Ratzinger became an admirer of [[Karl Rahner]], a well-known academic theologian of the [[Nouvelle Théologie]] and a proponent of church reform.

In 1966, Ratzinger was appointed to a chair in dogmatic theology at the [[University of Tübingen]], where he was a colleague of [[Hans Küng]]. In his 1968 book ''[[Introduction to Christianity]]'', he wrote that the pope has a duty to hear differing voices within the Church before making a decision, and he downplayed the centrality of the papacy. During this time, he distanced himself from the atmosphere of Tübingen and the [[Marxism|Marxist]] leanings of the student movement of the 1960s that quickly radicalised, in the years 1967 and 1968, culminating in a series of disturbances and riots in April and May 1968. Ratzinger came increasingly to see these and associated developments (such as decreasing respect for authority among his students) as connected to a departure from traditional Catholic teachings.&lt;ref name="sobene"&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Van Biema |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C1053658%2C00.html |title=The Turning Point |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=24 April 2005 |accessdate=7 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62GwP8zAN?url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1053658,00.html |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his reformist bent, his views increasingly came to contrast with the liberal ideas gaining currency in theological circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Daniel J. |last1=Wakin |first2=Richard |last2=Bernstein |first3=Mark |last3=Landler |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/international/worldspecial2/24ratzinger.html?position=&amp;incamp=article_popular_5&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;position= |title=Turbulence on Campus in 60's Hardened Views of Future Pope |work=The New York Times |date=24 April 2005 |accessdate=8 June 2005 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62HbkldsN?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/international/worldspecial2/24ratzinger.html?position=&amp;incamp=article_popular_5&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;position= |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some voices, among them Küng, deem this a turn towards conservatism, while Ratzinger himself said in a 1993 interview, "I see no break in my views as a theologian [over the years]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C979775-1%2C00.html |title=Keeper of the Straight and Narrow |last=Ostling |first=Richard N. |last2=Moody |first2=John |last3=Morris |first3=Nomi |date=6 December 1993 |accessdate=10 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62HcTzmdm?url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979775-1,00.html |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratzinger continued to defend the work of the Second Vatican Council, including ''[[Nostra aetate]],'' the document on respect of other religions, [[ecumenism]] and the declaration of the right to [[freedom of religion]]. Later, as the [[Joseph Ratzinger as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], Ratzinger most clearly spelled out the Catholic Church's position on other religions in the 2000 document ''[[Dominus Iesus]]'' which also talks about the Catholic way to engage in "[[Catholic Church and ecumenism|ecumenical]] dialogue". During his time at Tübingen University, Ratzinger published articles in the reformist theological journal ''[[Concilium (journal)|Concilium]]'', though he increasingly chose less reformist themes than other contributors to the magazine such as Küng and Schillebeeckx.

In 1969, he returned to Bavaria, to the [[University of Regensburg]] and co-founded the theological journal ''[[Communio]]'', with [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], [[Henri de Lubac]], [[Walter Kasper]] and others, in 1972. ''Communio'', now published in seventeen languages, including German, English and Spanish, has become a prominent journal of contemporary Catholic theological thought. Until his election as pope, he remained one of the journal's most prolific contributors. In 1976, he suggested that the [[Augsburg Confession]] might possibly be recognised as a Catholic statement of faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dulles, s.j.|first=Avery|date=October 1983 |title=The Catholicity of the Augsburg Confession|journal=[[The Journal of Religion]]|volume=63|issue=4|pages=337–354|doi=10.1086/487060|authorlink=Avery Dulles|jstor=1203403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fahlbusch | first1 = Erwin|first2=Geoffrey William |last2= Bromiley |first3=David B. |last3= Barrett | chapter=Evangelical Catholicity|title = The Encyclopedia of Christianity | publisher=Wm.

[[File:Palais Holnstein Munich.JPG|thumb|right|[[Palais Holnstein]] in Munich, the residence of Benedict as Archbishop of Munich and Freising]]
On 24 March 1977, Ratzinger was appointed [[Archdiocese of Munich and Freising|Archbishop of Munich and Freising]]. He took as his episcopal motto ''Cooperatores Veritatis'' (Co-workers of the Truth) from [[Third Epistle of John|3&amp;nbsp;John]] 8, a choice he comments upon in his autobiographical work, ''Milestones''.
In the consistory of the following 27 June, he was named Cardinal-Priest of [[Santa Maria Consolatrice al Tiburtino]] by Pope Paul VI. By the time of the 2005 Conclave, he was one of only 14 remaining cardinals appointed by Paul VI, and one of only three of those under the age of 80. Of these, only he and [[William Wakefield Baum]] took part in the conclave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0502405.htm |publisher=[[Catholic News Service]] |first=John |last=Thavis |first2=Cindy |last2=Wooden |title=Cardinal Ratzinger, guardian of church doctrine, elected 265th pope |date=19 April 2005 |accessdate=17 July 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62HcvDKc8?url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0502405.htm |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith: 1981–2005===
[[File:Ratzinger-Rom88.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Cardinal Ratzinger in Rome, 12 October 1988]]
{{Main|Joseph Ratzinger as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith}}

On 25 November 1981, Pope John Paul II, upon the retirement of [[Franjo Šeper]], named Ratzinger as the Prefect of the [[Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], formerly known as the "Sacred Congregation of the [[Holy Office]]", the historical [[Roman Inquisition]]. Consequently, he resigned his post at Munich in early 1982. He was promoted within the College of Cardinals to become [[Bishop of Velletri-Segni|Cardinal Bishop of Velletri-Segni]] in 1993 and was made the college's vice-dean in 1998 and dean in 2002. Just a year after its foundation in 1990 Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger joined
the [[European Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in Salzburg/Austria in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theology.de/theologie/theologen/papstbenediktxvi.php theology] → Biography Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger / Pope Benedict XVI → Mitgliedschaften → EuropAcad → 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abitur-werne.de/english/religion/bio-pope-benedict.html Biography of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger / Pope Benedict XVI] → Mitgliedschaften → EuropAcad → 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratzinger defended and reaffirmed Catholic doctrine, including teaching on topics such as [[birth control]], homosexuality and inter-religious dialogue. The theologian [[Leonardo Boff]], for example, was suspended, while others such as [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]] were censured. Other issues also prompted condemnations or revocations of rights to teach: for instance, some posthumous writings of [[Jesuit]] priest [[Anthony de Mello]] were the subject of a [[Notification (Holy See)|notification]]. Ratzinger and the congregation viewed many of them, particularly the later works, as having an element of religious indifferentism (''i.e.'', Christ was "one master alongside others"). In particular, ''Dominus Iesus'', published by the congregation in the jubilee year 2000, reaffirmed many recently "unpopular" ideas, including the Catholic Church's position that "Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved." The document angered many Protestant churches by claiming that they are not actually churches, but "ecclesial communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20000806_dominus-iesus_en.html|title=Dominus Iesus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratzinger's 2001 letter ''[[De delictis gravioribus]]'' clarified the confidentiality of internal church investigations, as defined in the 1962 document ''[[Crimen Sollicitationis]]'', into accusations made against priests of certain crimes, including [[sexual abuse]]. This became a subject of controversy during the [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|sex abuse cases]].&lt;ref name="observer-2001-let"&gt;{{cite news | first=Jamie | last=Doward | url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1469055,00.html | title=Pope 'obstructed' sex abuse inquiry |work=The Observer  |location=London | date=24 April 2005 |accessdate=14 July 2007 }} [https://www.webcitation.org/62Hdu4m2k?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/apr/24/children.childprotection WebCitation archive]&lt;/ref&gt; For 20 years, Ratzinger had been the man in charge of enforcing the document.&lt;ref name="BBC2006Doc"&gt;''[[Sex Crimes and the Vatican (film)|Sex Crimes and the Vatican]]'' ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/5402928.stm an October 2006 BBC documentary quotation]):

On 12 March 1983, Ratzinger, as prefect, notified the lay faithful and the clergy that [[Archbishop]] [[Pierre Martin Ngo Dinh Thuc]] had incurred [[excommunication]] ''[[latae sententiae]]'' for [[valid but illicit|illicit]] [[ordination|episcopal consecrations]] without the apostolic mandate. In 1997, when he turned 70, Ratzinger asked Pope John Paul II for permission to leave the Congregation of the Doctrine of Faith and to become an archivist in the [[Vatican Secret Archives]] and a librarian in the [[Vatican Library]], but Pope John Paul ll refused his assent.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, Simon [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/the-pope/7928493/Pope-Benedict-wanted-to-be-a-librarian.html "Pope Benedict wanted to be a librarian"] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 5 August 2010.

===Election to the papacy===
{{Main|Papal conclave, 2005}}

Benedict XVI was [[Papal election|elected]] the [[List of popes|265th pope]] at the age of 78. He is the [[List of ages of Popes|oldest person to have been elected pope]] since [[Pope Clement XII]] (1730–40). He served longer as a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] before becoming Pope than any Pontiff since [[Pope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] (1724–30). Benedict and his [[Polish people|Polish]] predecessor [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] were the first consecutive non-Italian popes since the seven consecutive Frenchmen of the [[Avignon Papacy]] (1309–78). The last pope named Benedict was [[Pope Benedict XV|Benedict XV]], an Italian who reigned from 1914 to 1922, during World War I (1914–18).

On 2 January 2005, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine quoted unnamed Vatican sources as saying that Ratzinger was a front runner to succeed John Paul II should he die or become too ill to continue as pope. On the death of John Paul II, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' gave the odds of Ratzinger becoming pope as 7–1, the lead position, but close to his rivals on the liberal wing of the church. In April 2005, before his election as pope, he was identified as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by ''Time''.&lt;ref name="Time 100"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1972656_1972691_1973018,00.html | title=Time 100 2005 | work=Time | date=18 April 2005 | accessdate=3 April 2013 | author=Sullivan, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Ratzinger repeatedly stated he would like to retire to his house in the Bavarian village of Pentling near [[Regensburg]] and dedicate himself to writing books.

At the [[Papal conclave|conclave]], "it was, if not Ratzinger, who? And as they came to know him, the question became, why not Ratzinger?"&lt;ref name="goodstein"&gt;{{cite news|author=Goodstein, Laurie and Elisabetta Povoledo |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/world/europe/among-cardinals-deep-divisions-over-next-pope.html |title=Before Smoke Rises at Vatican, It's Romans vs. the Reformers |work= New York Times|date= 11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ivereigh, Austen |url=http://www.osvdailytake.com/2013/03/ivereigh-in-rome-does-cardinal.html |title=Does cardinal confusion spell a long conclave? |work=Our Sunday Visitor |date= 11 March 2013 |accessdate= 12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April 2005, he was elected on the second day after four ballots.&lt;ref name="goodstein"/&gt; Cardinal [[Cormac Murphy-O'Connor]] described the final vote, "It's very solemn when you go up one by one to put your vote in the urn and you're looking up at the Last Judgement of Michelangelo. And I still remember vividly the then Cardinal Ratzinger sitting on the edge of his chair."&lt;ref&gt;Cormac Murphy-O'Connor speaking on BBC Radio 4's Midweek 13 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Ratzinger had hoped to retire peacefully and said that "At a certain point, I prayed to God 'please don't do this to me'...Evidently, this time He didn't listen to me."&lt;ref&gt;Pizzey, Allen [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/04/02/world/main684865.shtml "Benedict: I Prayed Not To Be Pope"] [[CBS News]] 11 February 2009. Retrieved 21 August 2011 [https://www.webcitation.org/62HgNOHkg?url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/04/02/world/main684865.shtml WebCitation archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Before his first appearance on the balcony of [[Saint Peter's Basilica]], he was announced by [[Jorge Medina Estévez]], [[Cardinal Protodeacon]] of the Catholic Church. Cardinal Medina Estévez first addressed the massive crowd as "dear(est) brothers and sisters" in Italian, Spanish, French, German and English, with each language receiving cheers from the international crowd, before continuing with the traditional ''[[Habemus Papam]]'' announcement in Latin.

At the balcony, Benedict's first words to the crowd, given in Italian before he gave the traditional ''[[Urbi et Orbi]]'' blessing in Latin, were:

{{quote|Dear brothers and sisters, after the great Pope John Paul II, the Cardinals have elected me, a simple, humble labourer in the vineyard of the Lord. The fact that the Lord knows how to work and to act even with insufficient instruments comforts me, and above all I entrust myself to your prayers. In the joy of the Risen Lord, confident of his unfailing help, let us move forward. The Lord will help us, and Mary, His Most Holy Mother, will be on our side. Thank you.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/index_en.htm|title=Election – BENEDICT XVI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

On 24 April, he celebrated the [[Papal Inauguration|Papal Inauguration Mass]] in [[St. Peter's Square]], during which he was invested with the [[Pallium]] and the [[Ring of the Fisherman]]. On 7 May, he took possession of his cathedral church, the [[Archbasilica of St. John Lateran]].

===Choice of name===
Ratzinger chose the [[papal name|pontifical name]] [[Pope Benedict (disambiguation)|Benedict]], which comes from the Latin word meaning "the blessed", in honour of both [[Pope Benedict XV]] and Saint [[Benedict of Nursia]]. [[Pope Benedict XV]] was pope during the First World War, during which time he passionately pursued peace between the warring nations. St. Benedict of Nursia was the founder of the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monasteries (most monasteries of the Middle Ages were of the Benedictine order) and the author of the ''[[Rule of Saint Benedict]]'', which is still the most influential writing regarding the monastic life of Western Christianity. The Pope explained his choice of name during his first general audience in St. Peter's Square, on 27 April 2005:

{{quote|Filled with sentiments of awe and thanksgiving, I wish to speak of why I chose the name Benedict. Firstly, I remember [[Pope Benedict XV]], that courageous prophet of peace, who guided the Church through turbulent times of war. In his footsteps I place my ministry in the service of reconciliation and harmony between peoples. Additionally, I recall [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict of Nursia]], co-[[patron saint|patron]] of Europe, whose life evokes the Christian roots of Europe. I ask him to help us all to hold firm to the centrality of Christ in our Christian life: May Christ always take first place in our thoughts and actions!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/audiences/2005/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20050427_en.html|title=General Audience of 27 April 2005 – BENEDICT XVI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Tone of papacy===
[[File:Benedikt XVI im Papamobil.jpg|thumb|Pope Benedict XVI's first trip in a [[popemobile]]]]
During his inaugural Mass, the previous custom of every cardinal submitting to the Pope was replaced by having twelve people, including cardinals, clergy, religious, a married couple and their child, and newly [[confirmation|confirmed]] people, greet him. (The cardinals had formally sworn their obedience upon his election.) He began using an open-topped [[Popemobile|papal car]], saying that he wanted to be closer to the people. Pope Benedict continued the tradition of his predecessor John Paul II and baptised several infants in the Sistine Chapel at the beginning of each year, in his pastoral role as Bishop of Rome.

====Beatifications====
On 9 May 2005, Benedict XVI began the [[beatification]] process for his predecessor, Pope John Paul II. Normally, five years must pass after a person's death before the beatification process can begin. However, in an audience with Pope Benedict, [[Camillo Ruini]], [[Vicar General]] of the Diocese of Rome and the official responsible for promoting the [[canonization|cause for canonization]] of any person who dies within that diocese, cited "exceptional circumstances" which suggested that the waiting period could be waived. This happened before, when Pope Paul VI waived the five-year rule and announced beatification processes for his predecessors, [[Pope Pius XII]] and [[Pope John XXIII]]. Benedict XVI followed this precedent when he waived the five-year rule for John Paul II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20050509_rescritto-gpii_en.html |title=Response of His Holiness Benedict XVI for the examination of the cause for beatification and canonization of the Servant of God John Paul II |publisher=Vatican.va |date=9 May 2005 |accessdate=2 February 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62HhLqGGU?url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20050509_rescritto-gpii_en.html |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was announced on 13 May 2005, the Feast of [[Our Lady of Fátima]] and the 24th anniversary of the attempt on John Paul II's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Drummer, Alexander |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-13001?l=english |title=Waiting Period Waived for John Paul II |agency=[[Zenit News Agency]] |date=13 May 2005 |accessdate=24 September 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62HhqWEPm?url=http://www.zenit.org/article-13001?l=english |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Paul II often credited Our Lady of Fátima for preserving him on that day.

The first beatification under the new pope was celebrated on 14 May 2005, by [[José Cardinal Saraiva Martins]], Cardinal Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]]. The new Blesseds were [[Mother Marianne Cope]] and [[Mother Ascensión Nicol Goñi]]. Cardinal [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]] was beatified on 9 October 2005. [[Mariano de la Mata]] was beatified in November 2006 and [[Rosa Eluvathingal]] was beatified 3 December of that year, and Fr. [[Basil Moreau]] was beatified September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holycrossusa.org/spirituality/our-founder-blessed-basil-moreau-csc/ |title=Our Founder |publisher=[[Congregation of Holy Cross]] |date=24 August 2011 |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62HiUpZeg?url=http://www.holycrossusa.org/spirituality/our-founder-blessed-basil-moreau-csc/ |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, the following beatifications took place: Celestine of the Mother of God, Giuseppina Nicoli, Hendrina Stenmanns, Maria Rosa Flesch, Marta Anna Wiecka, [[Michael Sopocko]], [[Petrus Kibe Kasui and 187 Companions]], [[Blessed Candlemas of San José|Susana Paz-Castillo Ramírez]], and Maria Isbael Salvat Romero.

On 19 September 2010, during his [[Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the United Kingdom|visit to the United Kingdom]], Benedict personally proclaimed the beatification of [[John Henry Newman]].&lt;ref name=Beatification&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11360529|title=Pope beatifies Cardinal Newman as his UK tour ends (with video clip)|publisher=BBC News|date=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike his predecessor, Benedict XVI delegated the beatification liturgical service to a Cardinal. On 29 September 2005, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued a communiqué announcing that henceforth beatifications would be celebrated by a representative of the pope, usually the prefect of that Congregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20050929_comunicato_en.html |title=Communiqué on beatification process |publisher=Vatican.va |date=29 September 2005 |accessdate=2 February 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62Hj1Y6F4?url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/csaints/documents/rc_con_csaints_doc_20050929_comunicato_en.html |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canonizations====
[[File:BentoXVI-43-11052007.jpg|thumb|Pope Benedict at the canonization of [[Frei Galvão]]]]
Pope Benedict XVI celebrated his first canonizations on 23 October 2005 in St. Peter's Square when he canonized [[Josef Bilczewski]], [[Saint Alberto Hurtado|Alberto Hurtado SJ]], [[Zygmunt Gorazdowski]], [[Gaetano Catanoso]] and [[Felice da Nicosia]]. The canonizations were part of a Mass that marked the conclusion of the [[General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops]] and the [[Year of the Eucharist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2005/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20051023_canonizations_en.html |title=Canonization of the Blesseds |publisher=Vatican.va |date=23 October 2005 |accessdate=2 February 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IFtEE0M?url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2005/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20051023_canonizations_en.html |archivedate=9 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Benedict XVI canonized [[Rafael Guizar Valencia|Bishop Rafael Guizar y Valencia]], [[Theodore Guerin|Mother Theodore Guerin]], [[Filippo Smaldone]] and [[Rosa Venerini]] on 15 October 2006.

====Doctors of the Church====
On 7 October 2012, Pope Benedict XVI named [[Hildegard of Bingen]] and [[John of Avila]] [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]], the 34th and 35th individuals so recognised in the history of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/10/07/pope-names-2-church-doctors-preacher-st-john-avila-and-mystic-st-hildegard/ |title=Pope names 2 church doctors: preacher St. John of Avila and mystic St. Hildegard of Bingen |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=26 June 2012 |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curia reform===
Pope Benedict made only modest changes to the structure of the Roman Curia. In March 2006, he placed both the [[Pontifical Council for Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant Peoples]] and the [[Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace]] under a single president, Cardinal [[Renato Martino]]. When Martino retired in 2009, the Councils each received its own preside once again. Also in March 2006, the [[Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue]] was briefly merged into the [[Pontifical Council for Culture]] under Cardinal [[Paul Poupard]]. Those Councils maintained their separate officials and staffs while their status and competencies continued unchanged, and in May 2007, Interreligious Dialogue was restored to its separate status again with its own president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = National Catholic Reporter | accessdate = 2 September 2016 | date = 30 May 2006 | url = https://www.ncronline.org/news/council-interreligious-dialogue-be-restored-vatican-says | title =Council for Interreligious Dialogue to be restored, Vatican says | first = John L. |last= Allen Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, Benedict created the [[Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation]], appointing Archbishop [[Rino Fisichella]] its first president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | agency= Catholic News Agency | accessdate = 2 September 2016 | date = 30 June 2010 | url = http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-appoints-archbishop-fisichella-to-lead-council-for-new-evangelization/ |title= Pope appoints Archbishop Fisichella to lead Council for New Evangelization }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 January 2013, Pope Benedict transferred responsibility for [[catechesis]] from the [[Congregation for the Clergy]] to the Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pope transfers responsibility for catechesis, seminaries|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/pope-transfers-responsibility-for-catechesis-seminaries/|accessdate=2 September 2016|agency=Catholic News Agency|date=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teachings===
{{See also|Theology of Pope Benedict XVI}}
As pope, one of Benedict XVI's main roles was to teach about the Catholic faith and the solutions to the problems of discerning and living the faith,&lt;ref&gt;Beach, Kevin [http://www.catholicmissionleaflets.org/leafpope.htm "What is the role of the Pope?"] Catholic Mission Leaflets [https://www.webcitation.org/62IN0XB3T?url=http://www.catholicmissionleaflets.org/leafpope.htm WebCitation archive]&lt;/ref&gt; a role that he could play well as a former head of the Church's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The main points of emphasis of his teachings are stated in more detail in Theology of Pope Benedict XVI.

===="Friendship with Jesus Christ"====
At the conclusion of his first homily as pope, Benedict referred to both [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] and John Paul II. Citing John Paul II's well-known words, "Do not be afraid! Open wide the doors for Christ!", Benedict XVI said:
{{quote|Are we not perhaps all afraid in some way? If we let Christ enter fully into our lives, if we open ourselves totally to Him, are we not afraid that He might take something away from us?...And once again the Pope said: No! If we let Christ into our lives, we lose nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing of what makes life free, beautiful and great. No! Only in this friendship do we experience beauty and liberation....When we give ourselves to Him, we receive a hundredfold in return. Yes, open, open wide the doors to Christ&amp;nbsp;– and you will find true life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20050424_inizio-pontificato_en.html |title=Mass for the Inauguration of the Pontificate of Pope Benedict XVI&amp;nbsp;– Homily of His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI |publisher=Vatican.va |date=24 April 2005 |accessdate=2 February 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62INVqmrK?url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20050424_inizio-pontificato_en.html |archivedate=9 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Friendship with Jesus Christ" is a frequent theme of his preaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/B16CLERO.HTM |title=To the Clergy of Rome, with Response to Interventions by Roman Clergy |publisher=EWTN |date=13 May 2005 |accessdate=2 February 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62INvGGMB?url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/B16CLERO.HTM |archivedate=9 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/pope/words/conclave_homily.asp |title=For Electing the Supreme Pontiff |publisher=EWTN |date=18 April 2005 |accessdate=2 February 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IOPsiuT?url=http://www.ewtn.com/pope/words/conclave_homily.asp |archivedate=9 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He stressed that on this intimate friendship, "everything depends."&lt;ref name=JON/&gt; He also said: "We are all called to open ourselves to this friendship with God... speaking to him as to a friend, the only One who can make the world both good and happy... That is all we have to do is put ourselves at his disposal...is an extremely important message. It is a message that helps to overcome what can be considered the great temptation of our time: the claim, that after the Big Bang, God withdrew from history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/curia/cdfjosma.htm|title=ST JOSEMARÍA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in his book ''Jesus of Nazareth'', his main purpose was "to help foster [in the reader] the growth of a living relationship" with Jesus Christ.&lt;ref name=JON&gt;{{cite news|author=Drummer, Alexander |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-19369?l=english |title=Benedict XVI's Book a Pastoral Work |agency=Zenit News Agency |date=15 April 2007 |accessdate=24 September 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IOlkqZL?url=http://www.zenit.org/article-19369?l=english |archivedate=9 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He took up this theme in his first encyclical ''[[Deus caritas est]]''. In his personal explanation and summary of the encyclical, he stated: "If friendship with God becomes for us something ever more important and decisive, then we will begin to love those whom God loves and who are in need of us. God wants us to be friends of his friends and we can be so, if we are interiorly close to them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Drummer, Alexander |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-15211?l=english |title=The Secret of Love, According to Benedict XVI&amp;nbsp;– Pope Explains Encyclical to Readers of Italian Magazine |agency=Zenit News Agency |date=7 February 2006 |accessdate=8 October 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62IQhgKSc?url=http://www.zenit.org/article-15211?l=english |archivedate=9 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he said that prayer is "urgently needed... It is time to reaffirm the importance of prayer in the face of the activism and the growing secularism of many Christians engaged in charitable work."

===="Dictatorship of relativism"====
Continuing what he said in the pre-conclave Mass about what he often referred to as the "central problem of our faith today",&lt;ref&gt;Ratzinger, Joseph ''[[Relativism: The Central Problem for Faith Today]]'' [[Eternal Word Television Network|EWTN]] May 1996. Retrieved 8 October 2011 [https://www.webcitation.org/62HjsipEm?url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/RATZRELA.HTM WebCitation archive]&lt;/ref&gt; on 6 June 2005 Pope Benedict also said:
{{quote|Today, a particularly insidious obstacle to the task of education is the massive presence in our society and culture of that relativism which, recognising nothing as definitive, leaves as the ultimate criterion only the self with its desires. And under the semblance of freedom it becomes a prison for each one, for it separates people from one another, locking each person into his or her own ego.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/june/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20050606_convegno-famiglia_en.html "Address of His Holiness Benedict XVI to the participants in the Ecclesial Diocesan Convention of Rome"] 6 June 2005
 Retrieved 8 October 2011 [https://www.webcitation.org/62HjauDV1?url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/june/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20050606_convegno-famiglia_en.html WebCitation archive]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He said that "a dictatorship of relativism"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/wyd082105.htm |title=Coverage of World Youth Day exclusively by NCR Report #4: Do-it-yourself religion 'cannot ultimately help us,' pope tells youth |last=Allen, Jr. |first=John L. |publisher=[[National Catholic Reporter]] |date=21 August 2005 |accessdate=2 February 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62Do1g5ka?url=http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/wyd082105.htm |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the core challenge facing the church and humanity. At the root of this problem, he said, is [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s "self-limitation of reason". This, he said, is contradictory to the modern acclamation of science whose excellence is based on the power of reason to know the truth. He said that this self-amputation of reason leads to pathologies of religion such as terrorism and pathologies of science such as [[List of environmental disasters|ecological disasters]].&lt;ref name=TT&gt;{{cite book |title=Truth And Tolerance: Christian Belief And World Religions |last=Ratzinger |first=Joseph |year=2003 |publisher=[[Ignatius Press]]|isbn=1-58617-035-X |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benedict traced the failed revolutions and violent ideologies of the 20th century to a conversion of partial points of view into absolute guides. He said "Absolutizing what is not absolute but relative is called totalitarianism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/august/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20050820_vigil-wyd_en.html|title=Apostolic Journey to Cologne: Vigil with youth at Marienfeld area (August 20, 2005) – BENEDICT XVI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an address to a conference of the Diocese of Rome held at the basilica of [[St. John Lateran]] 6 June 2005, Benedict remarked on the issues of [[same sex marriage]] and abortion:
{{quote|The various forms of the dissolution of matrimony today, like free unions, trial marriages and going up to pseudo-matrimonies by people of the same sex, are rather expressions of an anarchic freedom that wrongly passes for true freedom of man...from here it becomes all the more clear how contrary it is to human love, to the profound vocation of man and woman, to systematically close their union to the gift of life, and even worse to suppress or tamper with the life that is born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/6/6/144634.shtml |title=NewsMax Archives |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609135145/http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/6/6/144634.shtml |archivedate=9 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Christianity as religion according to reason====
In the discussion with [[secularism]] and [[rationalism]], one of Benedict's basic ideas can be found in his address on the "Crisis of Culture" in the West, a day before Pope John Paul II died, when he referred to Christianity as the Religion of the Logos (the Greek for "word", "reason", "meaning", or "intelligence"). He said:
{{quote|From the beginning, Christianity has understood itself as the religion of the ''Logos'', as the religion according to reason... It has always defined men, all men without distinction, as creatures and images of God, proclaiming for them...the same dignity. In this connection, the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] is of Christian origin and it is no accident that it was born precisely and exclusively in the realm of the Christian faith....It was and is the merit of the Enlightenment to have again proposed these original values of Christianity and of having given back to reason its own voice... Today, this should be precisely [Christianity's] philosophical strength, in so far as the problem is whether the world comes from the irrational, and reason is not other than a 'sub-product,' on occasion even harmful of its development—or whether the world comes from reason, and is, as a consequence, its criterion and goal...In the so necessary dialogue between secularists and Catholics, we Christians must be very careful to remain faithful to this fundamental line: to live a faith that comes from the ''Logos'', from creative reason, and that, because of this, is also open to all that is truly rational.&lt;ref name=Zenit05&gt;{{cite news|author=Drummer, Alexander |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-13705?l=english |title=Cardinal Ratzinger on Europe's Crisis of Culture (Part 4) |agency=[[Zenit News Agency]] |date=29 July 2005 |accessdate=24 September 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62Dl6ltQP?url=http://www.zenit.org/article-13705?l=english |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Benedict also emphasised that "Only creative reason, which in the crucified God is manifested as love, can really show us the way."&lt;ref name=Zenit05 /&gt;

Pope Benedict wrote three [[encyclical]]s: ''[[Deus caritas est]]'' (Latin for "God is Love"), ''[[Spe Salvi]]'' ("Saved by Hope"), and ''[[Caritas in veritate]]'' ("Love in Truth"). In his first encyclical, ''Deus caritas est'', he said that a human being, created in the image of God who is love, is able to practice love: to give himself to God and others ([[agape]]) by receiving and experiencing God's love in contemplation. This life of love, according to him, is the life of the saints such as [[Mother Teresa|Teresa of Calcutta]] and the [[Veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church|Blessed Virgin Mary]], and is the direction Christians take when they believe that God loves them in Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20051225_deus-caritas-est_en.html |title=''Deus caritas est'' |publisher=Vatican.va |date=25 December 2005 |accessdate=2 February 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62DkoEEdY?url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20051225_deus-caritas-est_en.html |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The encyclical contains almost 16,000 words in 42 paragraphs. The first half is said to have been written by Benedict in German, his first language, in the summer of 2005; the second half is derived from uncompleted writings left by his predecessor, Pope John Paul II.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Ian [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/26/international/europe/26pope.html?pagewanted=all "Benedict's First Encyclical Shuns Strictures of Orthodoxy"] ''The New York Times'' 26 January 2006.

Benedict's second encyclical titled ''Spe Salvi'' ("Saved by Hope"), about the virtue of [[hope]], was released on 30 November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thavis, John |url=http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=26059 |title=People need God to have hope, pope in new encyclical |publisher=Catholic News Service |date=30 November 2007 |accessdate=2 February 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62DinnE2T?url=http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=26059 |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20071130_spe-salvi_en.html|title=Spe salvi (November 30, 2007) – BENEDICT XVI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His third encyclical titled ''Caritas in veritate'' ("Love in Truth" or "Charity in Truth"), was signed on 29 June 2009 (the Feast of Sts. Peter and Paul) and released on 7 July 2009.&lt;ref name="DonadoNYT"&gt;{{cite news|first=Rachel |last=Donadio |title=Pope Urges Forming New World Economic Order to Work for the 'Common Good' |work=The New York Times |date=7 July 2009 |accessdate=7 July 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/08/world/europe/08pope.html |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62DhpM5zN?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/08/world/europe/08pope.html |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, the Pope continued the Church's teachings on social justice. He condemned the prevalent economic system "where the pernicious effects of sin are evident," and called on people to rediscover ethics in business and economic relations.&lt;ref name="DonadoNYT" /&gt;

At the time of his resignation, Benedict had completed a draft of a fourth encyclical entitled ''[[Lumen fidei]]'' ("The Light of Faith"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/the-vatican/detail/articolo/enciclica-papa-el-papa-pope-lumen-fidei-26222/ | title = The light of faith: origin, history and horizon of the christianism |newspaper = [[La Stampa]] | location = Turin | first = Alessandro | last = Speciale | date = 4 July 2013 | accessdate = 19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; intended to accompany his first two encyclicals to complete a trilogy on the three [[theological virtues]] of [[faith in Christianity|faith]], [[hope (virtue)|hope]], and [[charity (virtue)|love]].  Benedict's successor, [[Pope Francis]], completed and published ''Lumen Fidei'' in June 2013, four months after Benedict's retirement and Francis' succession.  Although the encyclical is officially the work of Pope Francis, paragraph 7 of the encyclical explicitly expresses Francis' debt to Benedict:  "These considerations on faith — in continuity with all that the Church's magisterium has pronounced on this theological virtue — are meant to supplement what Benedict XVI had written in his encyclical letters on charity and hope. He himself had almost completed a first draft of an encyclical on faith. For this I am deeply grateful to him, and as his brother in Christ I have taken up his fine work and added a few contributions of my own."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20130629_enciclica-lumen-fidei_en.html ''Lumen Fidei''], 7&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-synodal apostolic exhortation====
''[[Sacramentum caritatis]]'' (The Sacrament of Charity), signed 22 February 2007, was released in Latin, Italian, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Polish. It was made available in various languages 13 March 2007 in Rome. The English edition from ''Libera Editrice Vaticana'' is 158 pages. This [[apostolic exhortation]] "seeks to take up the richness and variety of the reflections and proposals which emerged from the Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops" which was held in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20070222_sacramentum-caritatis_en.html|title=Sacramentum Caritatis: Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation on the Eucharist as the Source and Summit of the Church's Life and Mission (22 February 2007) – BENEDICT XVI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Motu proprio on Tridentine Mass====
{{See also|Summorum Pontificum}}
[[File:unchurch.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A pre-1969 [[Tridentine Mass|Traditional Latin Mass]] altar with [[reredos]].&lt;br /&gt; The [[high altar]] of a church was usually preceded by three steps, below which were said the [[Prayers at the Foot of the Altar]]. Side altars usually had only one step.]]
On 7 July 2007, Benedict XVI issued the ''[[motu proprio]] [[Summorum Pontificum]]'', declaring that upon "the request of the faithful", celebration of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] according to the [[Tridentine Mass|Missal of 1962]] (commonly known as the Tridentine Mass), was to be more easily permitted. Stable groups who previously had to petition their bishop to have a Tridentine Mass may now merely request permission from their local priest.&lt;ref name="Afica Latin"&gt;{{cite news |title=Pope Allows Worldwide Use of Old Latin Mass|publisher=Catholic Information Service for Africa|date=10 July 2007|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200707101009.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Summorum Pontificum'' directs that pastors should provide the Tridentine Mass upon the requests of the faithful, it also allows for any qualified priest to offer private celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, to which the faithful may be admitted if they wish.&lt;ref name="letter Motu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter of His Holiness Benedict XVI to the Bishops on the Occasion of the Publication of the Apostolic Letter ''Motu Proprio Data'' Summorum Pontificum, On the Use of the Roman Liturgy Prior to the Reform of 1970 |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html |author=Pope Benedict XVI |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62CDkLx7N?url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For regularly scheduled public celebrations of the Tridentine Mass, the permission of the priest in charge of the church is required.&lt;ref&gt;Article 5 §4 of the motu proprio&lt;/ref&gt;

In an accompanying letter, the Pope outlined his position concerning questions about the new guidelines.&lt;ref name="letter Motu"/&gt; As there were fears that the move would entail a reversal of the Second Vatican Council,&lt;ref name="Jason"&gt;{{cite news|title=Criticism over return of Latin Mass |author=Burke, Jason |url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/07/09/stories/2007070955601600.htm |work=The Hindu |date=9 July 2007 |accessdate=4 October 2011 |location=Chennai, India |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62CCyEr9l?url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/07/09/stories/2007070955601600.htm |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benedict emphasised that the Tridentine Mass would not detract from the Council, and that the [[Mass of Paul VI]] would still be the norm and priests were not permitted to refuse to say the Mass in that form. He pointed out that use of Tridentine Mass "was never juridically abrogated and, consequently, in principle, was always permitted."&lt;ref name="letter Motu"/&gt; The letter also decried "deformations of the liturgy ... because in many places celebrations were not faithful to the prescriptions of the new Missal" as the Second Vatican Council was wrongly seen "as authorising or even requiring creativity", mentioning his own experience.&lt;ref name="letter Motu"/&gt;

The Pope considered that allowing the Tridentine Mass to those who request it was a means to prevent or heal [[schism (religion)|schism]], stating that, on occasions in history, "not enough was done by the Church's leaders to maintain or regain reconciliation and unity" and that this "imposes an obligation on us today: to make every effort to enable for all those who truly desire unity to remain in that unity or to attain it anew."&lt;ref name="letter Motu"/&gt; Many feel the decree aimed at ending the schism between the Holy See and traditionalist groups such as the [[Society of Saint Pius X]] (SSPX). Cardinal [[Darío Castrillón Hoyos]], the president of the [[Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei|Pontifical Commission established for the purpose of facilitating full ecclesial communion of those associated with that Society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/ced_documents/rc_con_cfaith_20090930_ecclesia-dei_en.html |title=Pontifical Commission 'Ecclesia Dei' |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=14 June 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62CCY1n2C?url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/ced_documents/rc_con_cfaith_20090930_ecclesia-dei_en.html |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that the decree "opened the door for their return". Bishop [[Bernard Fellay]], superior general of the SSPX, expressed "deep gratitude to the Sovereign Pontiff for this great spiritual benefit".&lt;ref name="Afica Latin"/&gt;

====Unicity and salvific universality of the Catholic Church====
Near the end of June 2007, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a document approved by Benedict XVI "because some contemporary theological interpretations of [[Vatican II]]'s ecumenical intent had been 'erroneous or ambiguous' and had prompted confusion and doubt."&lt;ref name="Winfield"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pope: Other Christians not true churches |first=Nicole |last=Winfield |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-07-10-1587290358_x.htm |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=USA Today |date=10 July 2007 |accessdate=18 September 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62CCFXvHG?url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-07-10-1587290358_x.htm |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The document has been seen as restating "key sections of a 2000 text the pope wrote when he was prefect of the congregation, ''Dominus Iesus''."&lt;ref name="Winfield"/&gt;

====Consumerism====
Benedict XVI condemned excessive [[consumerism]], especially among youth. He stated in December 2007 that "[A]dolescents, youths and even children are easy victims of the corruption of love, deceived by unscrupulous adults who, lying to themselves and to them, draw them into the dead-end streets of consumerism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Ecumenism and interfaith dialogue===
[[File:Pope Benedict XVI 1.jpg|thumb|right|Pope Benedict XVI on a throne in the [[Apostolic Palace]]]]

====Other Christian denominations====
{{Main|Pope Benedict XVI and ecumenism}}
Speaking at his weekly audience in St Peter's Square on 7 June 2006, Pope Benedict asserted that Jesus himself had entrusted the leadership of the Church to his apostle [[Saint Peter|Peter]]. "Peter's responsibility thus consists of guaranteeing the communion with Christ. Let us pray so that the [[primacy of Simon Peter|primacy of Peter]], entrusted to poor human beings, may always be exercised in this original sense desired by the Lord, so that it will be increasingly recognised in its true meaning by brothers who are still not in communion with us."

Also in 2006, Benedict met [[Rowan Williams]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and spiritual head of the [[Anglican Communion]]. In their Common Declaration, they highlighted the previous 40 years of dialogue between Catholics and Anglicans while also acknowledging "serious obstacles to our ecumenical progress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/november/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20061123_common-decl_en.html |title=Common Declaration of Pope Benedict XVI and the Archbishop of Canterbury His Grace Rowan Williams |publisher=Vatican.va |date=23 November 2006 |accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benedict also acknowledged the [[Lutheran]] church, saying that he has had friends in that denomination.

====Judaism====
{{Main|Pope Benedict XVI and Judaism}}
When Benedict ascended to the Papacy his election was welcomed by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] who noted "his great sensitivity to Jewish history and the [[Holocaust]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/VaticanJewish_96/44698_96.htm|title=ADL Welcomes Election of Cardinal Ratzinger as New Pope|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115060118/http://www.adl.org/PresRele/VaticanJewish_96/44698_96.htm|archivedate=15 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his election received a more reserved response from the United Kingdom's Chief Rabbi [[Jonathan Sacks]], who hoped that Benedict would "continue along the path of Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II in working to enhance relations with the Jewish people and the State of Israel."&lt;ref name="BBC4462503"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4462503.stm | title=In quotes: Reaction to Pope election | date=20 April 2005 |publisher=BBC News  | accessdate=31 January 2009}} [https://www.webcitation.org/6299zbnQI?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4462503.stm WebCitation archive]&lt;/ref&gt; The Foreign Minister of Israel also offered more tentative praise, though the Minister believed that "this Pope, considering his historical experience, will be especially committed to an uncompromising fight against anti-Semitism."&lt;ref name="BBC4462503"/&gt;

Critics have accused Benedict's papacy of insensitivity towards Judaism. The two most prominent instances were the expansion of the use of the Tridentine Mass and the lifting of the excommunication on four bishops from the [[Society of St. Pius X]] (SSPX). In the Good Friday service, the traditional Mass rubrics include a prayer that asks God to lift the veil so ''they [Jews] may be delivered from their darkness''. This prayer has historically been contentious in Judaic-Catholic relations and several groups saw the [[Good Friday Prayer for the Jews#Debate after the Summorum Pontificum motu proprio|restoration of the Tridentine Mass as problematic.]]&lt;ref name="tomorrow"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=9812 |title=Vatican to release Benedict XVI's letter on the use of the Tridentine Mass tomorrow |publisher=Catholicnewsagency.com |date=6 July 2007 |accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sandiegojewishworld.com/2007-sdjw/2007-07%20sdjw/2007-07-06friday/2007-07-06.htm "Mikulanis says ADL jumped gun, got its facts wrong"] ''San Diego Jewish World''.

====Islam====
{{Main|Pope Benedict XVI and Islam}}
Pope Benedict's relations with Islam were strained at times. On 12 September 2006 he delivered a lecture which touched on Islam at the University of Regensburg in Germany. He had served there as a professor of theology before becoming Pope, and his lecture was entitled "Faith, Reason and the University—Memories and Reflections". The lecture received much attention from political and religious authorities. Many [[Islamic world|Islamic politicians and religious leaders]] registered their protest against what they labelled an insulting mischaracterisation of Islam, although his focus was aimed towards the rationality of religious violence, and its effect on the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5348436.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Europe – In quotes: Muslim reaction to Pope|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5353208.stm |title=Pope sorry for offending Muslims |publisher=BBC News |date=17 September 2006 |accessdate=2 February 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/628xCsPph?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5353208.stm |archivedate=2 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims were particularly offended by this passage that the Pope quoted in his speech: "Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached."&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt;

As pontiff, Benedict XVI carried out numerous Apostolic activities including journeys across the world and in the Vatican.

Benedict travelled extensively during the first three years of his papacy.

In 2007, Pope Benedict visited Brazil in order to address the Bishops' Conference there and canonize Friar Antônio Galvão, an 18th-century [[Franciscan]]. In June 2007, Benedict made a personal pilgrimage and pastoral visit to [[Assisi]], the birthplace of [[St. Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]].

Pope Benedict's main arena for pastoral activity was the Vatican itself, his Christmas and Easter homilies and Urbi et Orbi are delivered from St Peter's Basilica. The Vatican is also the only regular place where Benedict XVI traveled via motor without the protective bulletproof case common to most popemobiles. Despite the more secure setting, Pope Benedict was victim to security risks several times inside Vatican City. On Wednesday, 6 June 2007 during his General Audience a man leapt across a barrier, evaded guards and nearly mounted the Pope's vehicle, although he was stopped and Benedict seemed to be unaware of the event.

Prior to 2001, the primary responsibility for investigating allegations of sexual abuse and disciplining perpetrators rested with the individual dioceses. In 2001, Ratzinger convinced John Paul II to put the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in charge of all investigations and policies surrounding sexual abuse in order to combat such abuse more efficiently.&lt;ref name="times-7086738"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article7086738.ece |work=The Times |location=London |title=John Paul 'ignored abuse of 2,000 boys' |first1=Bojan |last1=Pancevski |first2=John |last2=Follain |date=4 April 2010 |accessdate=22 May 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6269S63LN?url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article7086738.ece |archivedate=1 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ncr-maciel"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John L. Allen, Jr.]], Ratzinger in the following years "acquired a familiarity with the contours of the problem that virtually no other figure in the Catholic Church can claim" and "driven by that encounter with what he would later refer to as 'filth' in the Church, Ratzinger seems to have undergone something of a 'conversion experience' throughout 2003–04.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Head of the CDF, Ratzinger developed a reputation for handling these cases. According to Charles J. Scicluna, a former prosecutor handling sexual abuse cases, "Cardinal Ratzinger displayed great wisdom and firmness in handling those cases, also demonstrating great courage in facing some of the most difficult and thorny cases, ''sine acceptione personarum'' (without exceptions)".&lt;ref name="ncr-1 /"&gt;According to [[John L. Allen, Jr.]], Ratzinger in the following years "acquired a familiarity with the contours of the problem that virtually no other figure in the Catholic Church can claim" and "driven by that encounter with what he would later refer to as 'filth' in the Church, Ratzinger seems to have undergone something of a 'conversion experience' throughout 2003–04. From that point forward, he and his staff seemed driven by a convert's zeal to clean up the mess".

One of the cases Ratzinger pursued involved Father [[Marcial Maciel Degollado]], a Mexican priest and founder of the Legion of Christ, who had been accused repeatedly of sexual abuse. Biographer Andrea Tornielli suggested that Cardinal Ratzinger had wanted to take action against Marcial Maciel Degollado, but that John Paul II and other high-ranking officials, including several cardinals and notably the Pope's influential secretary [[Stanisław Dziwisz]], prevented him from doing so.&lt;ref name="ncr-maciel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="independent-johnpaul"&gt;{{cite news |work=The Irish Independent | first=Richard | last=Owen |url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/vatican-tries-to-shift-blame-for-abuse-on-to-john-paul-26646654.html |title=Vatican tries to shift blame for abuse on to John Paul&amp;nbsp;– Europe, World News  |date=3 April 2010 |accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jason Berry]], [[Angelo Sodano#Relationship with Legion of Christ|Angelo Sodano]] "pressured" Cardinal Ratzinger, who was "operating on the assumption that the charges were not justified", to halt the proceedings against Maciel in 1999&lt;ref name="nationalcatholicreporter.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/update/bn051806.htm |title=Vatican restricts ministry of Legionaries priest founder |work=National Catholic Reporter |first=John L. |last=Allen Jr. |date=18 May 2006 |accessdate=14 June 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/626CEqFEX?url=http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/update/bn051806.htm |archivedate=1 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Maciel was honored by the Pope in 2004, new accusers came forward&lt;ref name="nationalcatholicreporter.org"/&gt; and Cardinal Ratzinger "took it on himself to authorize an investigation of Maciel"&lt;ref name="ncr-maciel" /&gt; After Ratzinger became pope he began proceedings against Maciel and the [[Legion of Christ]] that forced Maciel out of active service in the Church.&lt;ref name="times-7086738" /&gt; On 1 May 2010 the Vatican issued a statement denouncing Maciel's "very serious and objectively immoral acts", which were "confirmed by incontrovertible testimonies" and represent "true crimes and manifest a life without scruples or authentic religious sentiment."

Pope Benedict XVI re-introduced several [[papal garments]] which had fallen into disuse. Pope Benedict XVI resumed the use of the traditional red [[papal shoes]], which had been used since Roman times by popes but which had fallen into disuse during the pontificate of Pope John Paul II. Contrary to the initial speculation of the press that the shoes had been made by the Italian fashion house [[Prada]], the [[Holy See|Vatican]] announced that the shoes were provided by the Pope's personal shoemaker.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;Meichtry, Stacy [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB114591920439834611 "Does the Pope Wear Prada?"] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. 25 April 2006.

On only one occasion, 21 December 2005, the Pope wore the [[camauro]], the traditional red papal hat usually worn in the winter. It had not been seen since the pontificate of Pope John XXIII (1958–1963). On 6 September 2006, the Pope began wearing the red [[cappello romano]] (also called a saturno), a wide-brimmed hat for outdoor use. Rarely used by John Paul II, it was more widely worn by his predecessors.

The journalist Charlotte Allen describes Benedict as "the pope of aesthetics": "He has reminded a world that looks increasingly ugly and debased that there is such a thing as the beautiful—whether it's embodied in a sonata or an altarpiece or an embroidered cope or the cut of a cassock—and that earthly beauty ultimately communicates a beauty that is beyond earthly things."&lt;ref name="latimes1"/&gt;

===Health===
Prior to his election as pope in 2005, Ratzinger had hoped to retire—on account of age-related health problems, a long-held desire to have free time to write, and the retirement age for bishops (75)—and submitted his resignation as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith three times, but continued at his post in obedience to the wishes of Pope John Paul II. In September 1991, Ratzinger suffered a hemorrhagic stroke, which slightly impaired his eyesight temporarily but he recovered completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/neuer-papst_aid_93745.html |title=Vor Jahren Ratzinger erlitt Hirnblutung |language=de |publisher=Focus Online |accessdate=14 June 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/624cM8LmI?url=http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/neuer-papst_aid_93745.html |archivedate=30 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was never officially made public—the official news was that Ratzinger had fallen and struck his head against a radiator—but was an open secret known to the conclave that elected him pope.&lt;ref name="op-online.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.op-online.de/nachrichten/welt/gesund-papst-benedikt-xvi-412967.html |title=Wie gesund ist Papst Benedikt XVI.? |language=de |publisher=Op-online.de |date=17 July 2009 |accessdate=12 September 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/624bp82dT?url=http://www.op-online.de/nachrichten/welt/gesund-papst-benedikt-xvi-412967.html |archivedate=30 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his election in April 2005 there were several rumors about the Pope's health, but none of them were confirmed. Early in his pontificate Benedict XVI predicted a short reign, which led to concerns about his health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/bal-te.health21apr21,0,5684034.story "Pope predicted 'short reign' in remarks just after election"] ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' 21 April 2005.

French Cardinal [[Philippe Barbarin]] said that since the first stroke Ratzinger had been suffering from an age-related heart condition, for which he was on medication. In late November 2006 Vatican insiders told the international press that the Pope had had a routine examination of the heart.&lt;ref name="op-online.de"/&gt; A few days later an unconfirmed rumor emerged that Pope Benedict had undergone an operation in preparation for an eventual bypass operation, but this rumor was only published by a small left-wing Italian newspaper and was never confirmed by any Vatican insider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/5510527.asp?gid=74 |title=Vatican: Pope Benedict's gaffes result of high tension |work=[[Hürriyet Daily News]] |accessdate=2 February 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/624ay1PWY?url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/5510527.asp?gid=74 |archivedate=30 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 July 2009, Benedict was hospitalized after falling and breaking his right wrist while on vacation in the Alps; his injuries were reported to be minor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C533505%2C00.html |title=Pope Benedict XVI Leaves Hospital After Breaking Wrist in Fall |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=17 July 2009 |accessdate=2 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/624aTg8ia?url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,533505,00.html |archivedate=30 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the announcement of his resignation, the Vatican revealed that Pope Benedict had been fitted with a [[pacemaker]] while he was still a cardinal, before his election as pope in 2005. The battery in the pacemaker had been replaced three months earlier, a routine procedure, but that did not influence his decision.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/europe/pope-benedict-xvi-says-he-will-retire.html?pagewanted=all "A Statement Rocks Rome, Then Sends Shockwaves Around the World"].

Currently, Benedict has multiple health problems including [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]] and reportedly has fallen out of bed more than once, but the Vatican denies any specific illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/04/12/vatican-denies-pope-emeritus-benedict-xvi-rumours-ill-health_n_3068212.html |title=Vatican Denies Rumours That Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI Is in Serious Ill Health |publisher=Huffingtonpost.co.uk |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement, Benedict cited his deteriorating strength and the physical and mental demands of the papacy;&lt;ref name="VatRadio_resign"/&gt; addressing his cardinals in Latin, Benedict gave a brief statement announcing his resignation.

According to a statement from the Vatican, the timing of the resignation was not caused by any specific illness but was to "avoid that exhausting rush of Easter engagements".&lt;ref name="Descrier_resign"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://descrier.co.uk/world/2013/02/pope-benedict-xvi-to-resign/ | title=Pope Benedict XVI to Resign due to Parkinson's Disease | publisher=The Descrier | date=11 February 2013 | accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two weeks of ceremonial farewells, the Pope left office at the appointed time and ''[[sede vacante]]'' was declared.

On the eve of the first anniversary of Benedict's resignation he wrote to ''[[La Stampa]]'' to deny speculation he had been forced to step down.

On the morning of 28 February 2013, Pope Benedict met with the full College of Cardinals and in the early afternoon flew by helicopter to the papal summer residence of [[Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo|Castel Gandolfo]]. He stayed there until refurbishment was completed on his retirement home, the [[Mater Ecclesiae|Mater Ecclesiae monastery]] in the [[Vatican Gardens]] near St Peter's, formerly home to 12 nuns, where he moved on 2 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ilmessaggero.it/primopiano/vaticano/papa_monastero_mater_ecclesiae_ratzinger/notizie/250887.shtml | title=Dopo le dimissioni il Papa si ritirerà presso il monastero Mater Ecclesiae fondato nel '94 per volontà di Wojtyla | publisher=Il Messagero | date=11 February 2013 | accessdate=12 February 2013 | language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; To protect it, there is a thick hedge and a fence.

Benedict XVI made his first public appearance after his resignation at St. Peter's Basilica on 22 February 2014 to attend the first [[papal consistory]] of his successor Pope Francis. Benedict XVI, who entered the basilica through a discreet entrance, was seated in a row with several other cardinals. He doffed his [[zucchetto]] when Pope Francis came down the nave of St. Peter's Basilica to greet him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tornielli |first=Andrea|title=The "hidden" Pope's first step towards normality|url=http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/the-vatican/detail/articolo/concsitoro-2014-32277/|accessdate=24 February 2014|newspaper=Vatican Insider|date=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then made an appearance at the [[Canonization of Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II|canonization]] mass of [[Pope John XXIII]] and [[Pope John Paul II]], greeting the cardinals and Pope Francis.

Benedict wrote the text of a speech, delivered by Archbishop Georg Gänswein, on the occasion of the dedication of the Aula Magna at the [[Pontifical Urbaniana University]] to the Pope Emeritus, "a gesture of gratitude for what he has done for the Church as a conciliar expert, with his teaching as professor, as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and, finally, the Magisterium."

"Pope Francis invited Benedict XVI to spend some time in Castel Gandolfo in the month of July and Benedict accepted", Fr. Lombardi told journalists on 15 June. Benedict XVI remained there for two weeks.

On 28 June 2017, the Pope Emeritus received the newly created cardinals in his chapel and "spoke with all of them in their native tongue" while also remarking that they were "from the four continents, the whole church". He further said that "The Lord wins in the end" and "thank you all", he said, before giving them his blessing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.romereports.com/2017/06/28/benedict-xvi-receives-the-new-cardinals-and-speaks-with-them-in-various-languages&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Benedict XVI sent a message through his private secretary Monsignor Gänswein for the occasion of the funeral of Cardinal [[Joachim Meisner]], who had suddenly passed away while on vacation in Germany. In his message, the Pope Emeritus referred to Meisner as a "passionate shepherd and pastor" who found it "difficult to leave his post". The former pope also said that he had spoken on the telephone with Meisner the day before the latter died and related that Meisner was grateful to be on vacation after having been present for the beatification of [[Teofilius Matulionis]] in [[Vilnius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2017/07/16/benedict-xvi-cardinal-meisner-was-a-passionate-shepherd-who-found-it-difficult-to-leave-his-post/|title=Benedict XVI: Cardinal Meisner was a 'passionate shepherd' who found it 'difficult to leave his post'|date=16 July 2017|publisher=Catholic Herald|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, images emerged on the Facebook page of the [[Bishop of Passau]] Stefan Oster of Benedict XVI with a black eye; the bishop and author Peter Seewald visited the former pope on 26 October since the pair were presenting Benedict XVI with the new book ''Benedict XVI – The German Pope'' which the Passau diocese created.

The official [[Style (manner of address)|style]] of the former Pope in English is ''His Holiness Benedict XVI, Supreme Pontiff Emeritus'' or ''Pope Emeritus''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annuario Pontificio]] 2013, p. 1, cited in [http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/1350523?eng=y Vatican Diary / The identity cards of the last two popes]&lt;/ref&gt; Less formally he is referred to as Emeritus Pope or Roman Pontifex Emeritus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/26/world/europe/vatican-benedict-title/index.html|title= Vatican reveals Pope Benedict's new title |publisher=CNN|date=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Pope, his rarely used full title was:&lt;blockquote&gt;[[His Holiness]] Benedict XVI, [[Bishop of Rome]], [[Vicar of Christ|Vicar of Jesus Christ]], [[Apostolic succession|Successor]] of the [[Saint Peter|Prince of the Apostles]], [[Pontifex Maximus|Supreme]] [[Pontiff#Christianity|Pontiff]] of the [[Catholic Church|Universal Church]], [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of [[Catholic Church in Italy|Italy]], [[Archbishop]] and [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of the [[List of the Roman Catholic dioceses in Italy#Ecclesiastical Province of Rome|Roman]] [[Ecclesiastical province#Catholic Church|Province]], [[List of Sovereigns of the Vatican City State|Sovereign]] of the [[Vatican City State]], [[Servant of the servants of God]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio'', published annually by Libreria Editrice Vaticana, p. 23*. ISBN of the 2012 edition: 978-88-209-8722-0.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The best-known title, that of "Pope", does not appear in the official list of titles, but is commonly used in the titles of documents, and appears, in abbreviated form, in their signatures as "PP." standing for "''Papa''" ("Pope").&lt;ref&gt;{{cathEncy|author=Shahan, Thomas Joseph|wstitle=Ecclesiastical Abbreviations|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2013|title =Pope |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=14 April 2013|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469994/pope}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inkunabeln.ub.uni-koeln.de/vdibDevelop/handapparat/nachs_w/cappelli/cappelli.html |author=Adriano Cappelli |title= Lexicon Abbreviaturarum |page=283 |accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/glossary/glo_11.html |title=Contractions and Abbreviations |publisher=Ndl.go.jp |date=4 August 2005 |accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/Papa+Pontifex |title=What Does PP Stand For? |publisher=Acronyms.thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1 March 2006, the list of titles also used to contain that of a "[[Patriarch of the West]]", which traditionally appeared in that list of titles before "Primate of Italy". The title of "Patriarch of the West" was first introduced into the papal court in 1870 at the time of the [[First Vatican Council]] in the publication ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' and was removed in the 2006 edition. Pope Benedict chose to remove the title at a time when discussions with the Orthodox churches have centered on the issue of [[papal primacy]].&lt;ref name="patriarch of the West"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wooden|first=Cindy|title=Vatican removes title 'patriarch of the West' after pope's name|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0601225.htm|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20060308013147/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0601225.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 March 2006|work=Catholic News Service|publisher=U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions on moral and political issues==

===Birth control and HIV/AIDS===
In 2005, the Pope listed several ways to combat the spread of HIV, including chastity, fidelity in marriage and anti-poverty efforts; he also rejected the use of condoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4081276.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Europe – Pope rejects condoms for Africa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alleged Vatican investigation of whether there are any cases when married persons may use condoms to protect against the spread of infections surprised many Catholics in the wake of John Paul II's consistent refusal to consider condom use in response to AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0%2C2144%2C1979145%2C00.html |title=Catholic Church to Ease Ban on Condom Use |publisher=Deutsche Welle |date=24 April 2006 |accessdate=28 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/623Bk3uHj?url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1979145,00.html |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Vatican has since stated that no such change in the Church's teaching can occur.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;{{cite news |author=Israely, Jeff 30 April 2006 |url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/article/0,13005,901060508-1189193,00.html |title=Condom Fight: The Vatican Strikes Back |work=Time |date=30 April 2006 |accessdate=2 February 2010 }} [https://www.webcitation.org/623AR9JiS?url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901060508-1189193,00.html WebCitation archive]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''TIME'' also reported in its edition of 30 April 2006 that the Vatican's position remains what it always has been with Vatican officials "flatly dismiss[ing] reports that the Vatican is about to release a document that will condone any condom use."&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;

In March 2009, the Pope stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I would say that this problem of AIDS cannot be overcome merely with money, necessary though it is. If there is no human dimension, if Africans do not help, the problem cannot be overcome by the distribution of prophylactics: on the contrary, they increase it. The solution must have two elements: firstly, bringing out the human dimension of sexuality, that is to say a spiritual and human renewal that would bring with it a new way of behaving towards others, and secondly, true friendship offered above all to those who are suffering, a willingness to make sacrifices and to practise self-denial, to be alongside the suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview of the Holy Father Benedict XVI during the flight to Africa |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2009/march/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20090317_africa-interview_en.html |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=7 October 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/623A6etYs?url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2009/march/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20090317_africa-interview_en.html |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 2010, in a book-length interview, the Pope, using the example of male prostitutes, stated that the use of condoms, with the intention of reducing the risk of HIV infection, may be an indication that the prostitute is intending to reduce the evil connected with his immoral activity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20101221_luce-del-mondo_en.html "Note on the banalization of sexuality Regarding certain interpretations of 'Light of the World'"] [https://www.webcitation.org/6239lgw3B?url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20101221_luce-del-mondo_en.html WebCitation archive]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same interview, the Pope also reiterated the traditional teaching of the Church that condoms are not seen as a "real or moral solution" to the [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]]. Further, in December 2010, the [[Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith]] explained that the Pope's statement did not constitute a legitimization of either contraception or prostitution, which remains gravely immoral.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Homosexuality===
{{See also|Homosexuality and the Catholic Church}}
During his time as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), Benedict XVI made several efforts to tackle the issue of homosexuality within the Church and the wider world. In 1986 the CDF sent a letter to all bishops entitled: ''[[On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons]]''. The letter condemned a liberal interpretation of the earlier CDF document ''Declaration on Certain Questions Concerning Sexual Ethics'', which had led to a "benign" attitude "to the homosexual condition itself". ''On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons'' clarified that the Church's position on homosexuality was that "although the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder."&lt;ref name="OPCHP"&gt;Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith [http://www.vatican.edu/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html "Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church On the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons"] 1 October 1986. Retrieved 28 September 2011 [https://www.webcitation.org/623993vbD?url=http://www.vatican.edu/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html WebCitation archive] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729052839/http://www.vatican.edu/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html |date=29 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the document also condemned homophobic attacks and violence, stating that "It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action. Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church's pastors wherever it occurs."&lt;ref name="OPCHP" /&gt;

In 1992, he again approved CDF documents declaring that homosexual "inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder" and extended this principle to civil law. "Sexual orientation", the document said, was not equivalent to race or ethnicity, and it declared that it was "not unjust discrimination to take sexual orientation into account."&lt;ref name=gland&gt;{{cite news|first=William |last=Saletan |author-link=William Saletan |title=Gland Inquisitor: Pope Benedict's antigay tendencies |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2131019/ |work=Slate |date=29 November 2005 |accessdate=30 December 2008 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6238n1v15?url=http://www.slate.com/id/2131019/ |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December 2008, the Pope gave an end of year message to the Roman Curia in which he talked about gender and the important distinction between men and women. The Pope said that the church viewed the distinction as central to human nature, and "asks that this order of creation be respected". The church, he said, must "protect man from self-destruction."

Father [[Federico Lombardi]], a Vatican spokesman, claimed the Pope had not wished specifically to attack people with homosexual inclinations, and had not mentioned gays or lesbians in his text. Father Lombardi insisted, however, that there had been an overreaction to the Pope's remarks: "He was speaking more generally about gender theories which overlook the fundamental difference in creation between men and women and focus instead on cultural conditioning." Nevertheless, the remarks were interpreted as a call to save mankind from homosexuals and transsexuals.&lt;ref name=gender/&gt;

====Same-sex marriage====
During a 2012 Christmas speech,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2012/december/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20121221_auguri-curia_en.html Address of his Holiness Benedict XVI on the occasion of Christmas greetings] Vatican.va, 21 December 2012. Retrieved 26 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the Pope made remarks about the present-day interpretation of the notion of "[[gender]]". He stated that "sex is no longer a given element of nature, that man has to accept and personally make sense of: it is a social role that we choose for ourselves", and "The words of the creation account: "male and female he created them" (Gen 1:27) no longer apply". Although he didn't mention the topic, his words were interpreted by news media as denunciations of [[same-sex marriage]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pope-denounces-gay-marriage-as-people-manipulating-their-godgiven-gender-to-suit-sexual-choices-8428862.html Pope denounces gay marriage as 'people manipulating their God-given gender to suit sexual choices'].

====Migrants and refugees====
In a message released 14 November 2006, during a Vatican press conference for the 2007 annual observance of [[Refugee#World Refugee Day|World Day for Migrants and Refugees]], the Pope urged the ratification of international conventions and policies that defend all migrants, including refugees, [[exile]]s, [[Emergency evacuation|evacuees]] and [[internally displaced person]]s. "The church encourages the ratification of the international legal instruments that aim to defend the rights of migrants, refugees and their families," the Pope said. "Much is already being done for the integration of the families of immigrants, although much still remains to be done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=22001 |title=Pope Benedict XVI message for 93rd World Day of Migrants and Refugees |publisher=Catholic Online |date=14 November 2006 |accessdate=2 February 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6236rFOB5?url=http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=22001 |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df= }}  and [https://www.webcitation.org/623763WF2?url=http://www.catholic.org/international/international_story.php?id=22001&amp;page=2 WebCitation archive page 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Benedict also promoted various UN events, such as [[World Refugee Day]], on which he offered up special prayers for refugees and called for the international community to do more to secure refugees' human rights. He also called on Catholic communities and organizations to offer them concrete help.&lt;ref&gt;Wooden, Cindy {{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0603503.htm |title=Pope offers prayers to refugees for United Nations' World Refugee Day |publisher=Catholicnews.com |accessdate=2 February 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6236TQsuV?url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0603503.htm |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====China====
{{Main|People's Republic of China – Holy See relations}}
In 2007, Benedict sent a letter at Easter to Catholics in China that could have wide-ranging implications for the church's relationship with China's leadership. The letter provides long-requested guidance to Chinese bishops on how to respond to illicitly ordained bishops, as well as how to strengthen ties with the [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association|Patriotic Association]] and the Communist government.&lt;ref name="Letter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070527_china_en.html |title=Letter of Pope Benedict XVI to Chinese Catholics, 27 May 2007 |publisher=Vatican.va |accessdate=2 February 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6236833mm?url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070527_china_en.html |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Korea====
On 13 November 2006, Benedict said that the dispute over the [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|North Korea nuclear weapons program]] should be resolved through negotiations, in his first public comment on the security issue, a news report said. "The Holy See encourages bilateral or multilateral negotiations, convinced that the solution must be sought through peaceful means and in respect for agreements taken by all sides to obtain the denuclearisation of the [[Korean Peninsula]]." Benedict was talking to the new Japanese ambassador to the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6235cWf1f?url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-154356074.html "Pope urges talks to make Korean Peninsula nuclear free"] YON – Yonhap News Agency of Korea 14 November 2006.

====Turkey====
{{Main|Holy See – Turkey relations}}
In a 2004 ''[[Le Figaro]]'' interview, Ratzinger said that Turkey, which is demographically Muslim but governmentally [[Secularism in Turkey|secular by virtue of its state constitution]], should seek its future in an association of [[Muslim world|Muslim nations]] rather than the European Union, which Ratzinger stated has Christian roots. He said Turkey had always been "in permanent contrast to Europe and that linking it to Europe would be a mistake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=31436|title=News Features|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later visiting the country to "reiterate the solidarity between the cultures," it was reported that he made a counter-statement backing [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkey's bid to join the EU]]. Prime Minister of Turkey [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], said that the Pope told him in their meeting that while the Vatican seeks to stay out of politics it desires Turkey's membership in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;Krause-Jackson, Flavia and Mark Bentley {{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=a0hofLY1v5.U&amp;refer=europe |title=Pope Benedict Backs Turkey's European Union Bid |publisher=Bloomberg |date=28 November 2006 |accessdate=2 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626182256/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=a0hofLY1v5.U&amp;refer=europe |archivedate=26 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }} [https://www.webcitation.org/6234kXZez?url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a0hofLY1v5.U&amp;refer=europe WebCitation archive]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6192770.stm |title=Pope calls for religious exchange |publisher=BBC News |date=28 November 2006 |accessdate=2 February 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6234Myjhi?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6192770.stm |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Common Declaration of Pope Benedict XVI and [[Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople]] implied that support for Turkey's membership in the European Union would be contingent on the establishment of religious freedom in Turkey:&lt;ref&gt;Donohue, William [http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?idcategory=34&amp;idSub=160&amp;idArticle=6852 "Pope did not change stance on Turkey and EU"], ''Spero News'', 30 November 2006 [https://www.webcitation.org/6233grkJY?url=http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?idcategory=34&amp;idSub=160&amp;idArticle=6852 WebCitation archive]&lt;/ref&gt; "In every step towards unification, minorities must be protected, with their cultural traditions and the distinguishing features of their religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2006/november/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20061130_dichiarazione-comune_en.html |title=Common Declaration by His Holiness Benedict XVI and Patriarch Bartholomew I |publisher=Vatican.va |date=30 November 2006|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration also reiterates Pope Benedict XVI's call for Europe to preserve its Christian roots.

===Global economy===
In 2009, the Pope intervened in global economic and political affairs with his third encyclical, ''Charity in Truth'' (Latin ''Caritas in veritate''), which can be viewed on the Vatican's web site.&lt;ref&gt;

This document set out the then reigning Pope's position on the case for worldwide redistribution of wealth in considerable detail and goes on to discuss the environment, migration, terrorism, sexual tourism, bioethics, energy and population issues.  ''The Financial Times'' reported that Benedict XVI's advocacy for a fairer redistribution of wealth helped set the agenda for the 2009 July G8 summit.&lt;ref&gt;

Also included in ''Charity in Truth'' is advocacy for [[tax choice]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One possible approach to development aid would be to apply effectively what is known as fiscal subsidiarity, allowing citizens to decide how to allocate a portion of the taxes they pay to the State. Provided it does not degenerate into the promotion of special interests, this can help to stimulate forms of welfare solidarity from below, with obvious benefits in the area of solidarity for development as well.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nuclear energy===
Pope Benedict XVI called for [[nuclear disarmament]]. At the same time, he supported the peaceful use of nuclear energy as a tool for development and the fight against poverty. In his message for the 50th anniversary of the founding of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], he confirmed: "The Holy See, fully approving of the IAEA's goal, has been a member from the organisation's foundation and continues to support its activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.karpasha.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=273:pope-calls-for-disarmament-backs-nuke-energy&amp;Itemid=66 |title=Pope calls for disarmament, backs nuke energy |date=13 July 2011 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713135315/http://news.karpasha.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=273%3Apope-calls-for-disarmament-backs-nuke-energy&amp;Itemid=66 |archivedate=13 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benedict's coat of arms omitted the [[papal tiara]], which traditionally appears in the background to designate the pope's position as a worldly ruler like a king, replacing it with a simple [[mitre]], emphasising his spiritual authority.&lt;ref name="Vatican-COA"&gt;Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo, Andrea [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/elezione/stemma-benedict-xvi_en.html Coat of Arms of His Holiness Benedict XVI] The Vatican.

Joseph Ratzinger wrote his dissertation on The People of God and the House of God in Augustine's Teaching is always about the Church, and therefore has a personal connection with the thought of this great Doctor of the Church.&lt;br /&gt;''Moor of Freising'': The Moor's head is an heraldic charge associated with Freising, Germany.&lt;br /&gt;''Corbinian's bear'': A legend states that while travelling to Rome, [[Saint Corbinian]]'s pack horse was killed by a bear. He commanded the bear to carry the load. Once he arrived, he released it from his service, and it returned to Bavaria. The implication is that "Christianity tamed and domesticated the ferocity of paganism and thus laid the foundations for a great civilisation in the Duchy of Bavaria." At the same time, Corbinian's bear, as God's beast of burden, symbolises the weight of office that Benedict carried.

The '''Ras Kamboni Brigades''' also known as the '''Ras Kamboni Brigade''', '''Muaskar Ras Kamboni''' or '''Mu'askar Ras Kamboni''' was an Islamist insurgent group active in [[Somalia]] (mostly in the [[Jubbaland]]s), which took part in the [[War in Somalia (2006–2009)|anti-Ethiopian insurgency]] and later in the [[War in Somalia (2009–)|insurgency]] against the new [[Transitional Federal Government]] of [[Sheikh Sharif Ahmed]]. It was founded by [[Hassan Abdullah Hersi al-Turki]], who was a commander of the [[Islamic Courts Union]] and the commander of its predecessor [[Itihaad al Islamiyah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dayaxnet.com/warar/article_2009_03_18_2411.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721195001/http://www.dayaxnet.com/warar/article_2009_03_18_2411.html |date=21 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, after the Ethiopian withdrawal they merged with the [[Asmara]]-based wing of the [[Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia]], led by [[Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys]], [[Jabhatul Islamiya]] ("Islamic Front"), led by Sheikh Mohamed Ibrahim Hayle and [[Muaskar Anole]] ("Anole School") to form [[Hizbul Islam]] and continue the war against the TFG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200902050135.html|title=Somalia: Islamist Groups Merge to Fight Sheikh Sharif|publisher=Allafrica.com|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Battle of Mogadishu (2009)|2009 Battle of Mogadishu]], where in Hizbul Islam took part, Hassan Turki led a group of fighters from the Ras Kamboni Brigade from [[Kisimayo]] to [[Mogadishu]] as reinforcements, to join the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200905180013.html|title=Somalia: Al Shabaab Registering 'Jihad Recruits'|publisher=Allafrica.com|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, the group left Hizbul Islam and joined [[Harakat al-Shabaab Mujahedeen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201002020211.html|title=Somalia: Notorious Islamist Guerrilla Leader Joins Al Shabaab|publisher=Allafrica.com|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Sheikh Hassan al-Turkey joined al-Shabaab, defecting commander Sheikh [[Ahmed Mohamed Islam]] "Madobe" left the organisation to form his own anti-al-Shabaab militia, the [[Raskamboni movement]].

The largest religion in Europe is [[Christianity]],&lt;ref name="Europe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Europe|title=Europe|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Irreligion in Europe|irreligion]] and practical [[secularization]] are strong.&lt;ref name="eurobarometer 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Religiously Unaffiliated" /&gt; Two countries in Southeastern Europe have [[Muslim]] majorities. Ancient European religions included veneration for [[deities]] such as [[Zeus]]. Modern revival movements of these religions include [[Germanic Neopaganism|Heathenism]], [[Slavic Neopaganism|Rodnovery]], [[Romuva (religion)|Romuva]], [[Neo-Druidism|Druidry]], [[Wicca]], and others. Smaller religions include [[Indian religions]], [[Judaism]], and some [[East Asian religions]], which are found in their largest groups in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]], and [[Kalmykia]].

==History==
Little is known about the [[prehistoric religion]] of [[Neolithic Europe]]. Bronze and Iron Age religion in Europe as elsewhere was predominantly [[polytheism|polytheistic]] ([[Ancient Greek religion]], [[Ancient Roman religion]], [[Basque mythology]], [[Finnish paganism]], [[Celtic polytheism]], [[Germanic paganism]], etc.).

The [[Roman Empire]] officially adopted Christianity in AD 380. During the [[Early Middle Ages]], most of Europe underwent [[Christianization]], a process essentially complete with the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]] in the [[High Middle Ages]]. The notion of "Europe" and the "[[Western World]]" has been intimately connected with the concept of "[[Christendom|Christianity and Christendom]]"; many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified [[European identity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=9780813216836|edition=reprint|author2=Glenn Olsen|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially since Christianity in the Middle East was marginalized by the rise of [[Islam]] from the 8th century, a constellation that led to the [[Crusades]], which although unsuccessful militarily were an important step in the emergence of a religious identity of Europe. At all times, traditions of [[folk religion]] existed largely independent from official denomination or dogmatic theology.

The [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]] of the 11th century and [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] of the 16th century were to tear apart Christendom into hostile factions, and following the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 18th century, [[atheism]] and [[agnosticism]] have spread across Europe. 19th-century [[Orientalism]] contributed to a certain popularity of [[Buddhism]], and the 20th century brought increasing [[syncretism]], [[New Age]], and various [[new religious movement]]s divorcing spirituality from inherited traditions for many Europeans. The latest history brought increased [[secularisation]], and [[religious pluralism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hans Knippenberg|title=The Changing Religious Landscape of Europe|publisher=Het Spinhuis|location=Amsterdam|year=2005|isbn=90-5589-248-3|pages=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religiosity==
European countries have experienced a decline in church membership and church attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aeon.co/essays/is-migration-making-europe-more-secular|title=Ronan McCrea – Is migration making Europe more secular?|author=Ronan McCrea|date=17 June 2013|work=Aeon Magazine|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capebretonpost.com/Opinion/Letters-to-the-Editor/2011-01-11/article-2109068/Church-attendance-faces-decline-almost-everywhere/1 Church attendance faces decline almost everywhere] retrieved 3 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A relevant example of the ongoing trend is [[Sweden]] where the church of Sweden, previously the state-church until 2000, claimed to have 82.9% of the Swedish population as its flock in 2000. Surveys showed this had dropped to 72.9% by 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=XLS|url=http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/default.aspx?di=23758&amp;refdi=23673|title=Svenska kyrkans medlemsutveckling år 1972–2008|trans-title=Swedish church's membership development in the years 1972–2008|language=sv|work=svenskakyrkan.se|date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813164944/http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/default.aspx?id=100243&amp;did=246083|archivedate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to 59.3% by 2017.&lt;ref name="svenskakyrkan 2017"&gt;[https://www.svenskakyrkan.se/statistik Svenska kyrkan i siffror] Svenska kyrkan&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the 2005 Eurobarometer survey 23%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf|title=Special Eurobarometer: Social values, Science and Technology|publisher=European Commission Public Opinion|date=June 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524004644/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf|archivedate=24 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Swedish population said that they don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force and in the 2010 Eurobarometer survey 34%&lt;ref name="eurobarometer 2010"/&gt; said the same.

===Eurobarometer survey 2010===
The 2010 Eurobarometer survey&lt;ref name="eurobarometer 2010"/&gt; found that, on average, 51% of the citizens of [[European Union|EU]] member states state that they "believe there is a God", 26% "believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" while 20% "don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force". 3% declined to answer.
According to a recent study (Dogan, Mattei, Religious Beliefs in Europe: Factors of Accelerated Decline), 47% of French people declared themselves as agnostics in 2003. This situation is often called "[[Post-Christian]] Europe". A decrease in religiousness and church attendance in [[Denmark]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Sweden]] has been noted, despite a concurrent increase in some countries Greece (2% in 1 year) {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}. The Eurobarometer survey must be taken with caution, however, as there are discrepancies between it and national census results. For example, in the United Kingdom, the 2001 census revealed over 70% of the population regarded themselves as "Christian" with only 15% professing to have "no religion", though the wording of the question has been criticized as "leading" by the [[British Humanist Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/campaigns/old-campaigns/census-2011/|title=The Census Campaign 2011|work=British Humanist Association|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romania, one of the most religious countries in Europe, witnessed a threefold increase in the number of atheists between 2002 and 2011, as revealed by the most recent national census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cristina Lica|url=http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/tot-mai-multi-romani-s-au-lepadat-de-dumnezeu-harta-ateilor-din-romania-1014215.html|title=Tot mai mulţi români "sţau lepadat" de Dumnezeu.

The decrease in theism is illustrated in the 1981 and 1999 according to the [[World Values Survey]],&lt;ref name="Religion and morale: Believe in God"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://margaux.grandvinum.se/SebTest/wvs/country_data_analysis?target=8|title=Religion and morale: Believe in God|work=World Values Survey|date=|accessdate=25 July 2007}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt; both for traditionally strongly theist countries (Spain: 86.8%:81.1%; Ireland 94.8%:93.7%) and for traditionally secular countries (Sweden: 51.9%:46.6%; France 61.8%:56.1%; Netherlands 65.3%:58.0%). Some countries nevertheless show increase of theism over the period, Italy 84.1%:87.8%, Denmark 57.8%:62.1%.

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{main article|Bahá'í Faith in Europe}}
The first newspaper reference to the religious movement began with coverage of the [[Báb]], whom Bahá'ís consider the founder of a precursor religion, occurred in ''[[The Times]]'' on 1 November 1845, only a little over a year after the Báb first started his mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Moojan|last=Momen|url=http://www.btinternet.com/%7Eiain.s.palin/heritage/firsts.htm|title=First Public Mentions of the Bahá'í Faith|publisher=Bahá'í Information Office (United Kingdom)|date=September 1989|accessdate=18 February 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226055043/http://www.btinternet.com/~iain.s.palin/heritage/firsts.htm|archivedate=26 February 2008|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; British, Russian, and other diplomats, businessmen, scholars, and world travelers also took note of the precursor [[Bábí]] religion&lt;ref name="Momen1981"&gt;{{citation | last = Momen | year = 1981 | first = Moojan | title = The Babi and Baha'i Religions, 1844–1944: Some Contemporary Western Accounts | location = Oxford, England |publisher = George Ronald | isbn = 0-85398-102-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably in 1865 by Frenchman [[Arthur de Gobineau]] who wrote the first and most influential account. In April 1890 [[Edward G. Browne]] of [[Cambridge University]] met [[Bahá'u'lláh]] and left the only detailed description by a Westerner.&lt;ref name="ukheritage"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.btinternet.com/%7Eiain.s.palin/heritage/ukhist.htm | author = U.K. Bahá'í Heritage Site | title = The Bahá'í Faith in the United Kingdom -A Brief History | accessdate = 2008-02-18 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080226055054/http://www.btinternet.com/~iain.s.palin/heritage/ukhist.htm | archivedate = 26 February 2008 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1890s Europeans began to convert to the religion. In 1910 Bahá'u'lláh's son and appointed successor, [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] embarked on a [[`Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West|three-year journey]] to including Europe and North America&lt;ref name="iranica_abdulbaha"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989|url=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v1f1/v1f1a064.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226160421/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v1f1/v1f1a064.html|archivedate=2008-02-26 |author1 = Alessandro Bausani | author2 = Dennis MacEoin }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then wrote a series of letters that were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]] which included mention of the need to spread the religion in Europe following the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |author2=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab |author3=trans. and comments  |title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1925 list of "leading local Bahá'í Centres" of Europe listed organized communities of many countries - the largest being in Germany.&lt;ref name="euro"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Hassall | first = Graham | last2 = Fazel | first2 = Seena | title = 100 Years of the Bahá'í Faith in Europe | periodical = Bahá'í Studies Review | issue = 8 | pages = 35–44 | volume = 1998 | url =http://bahai-library.com/hassall_fazel_100-years_europe }}&lt;/ref&gt; However the religion was soon banned in a couple countries: in 1937 [[Heinrich Himmler]] disbanded the Bahá'í Faith's institutions in Germany because of its 'international and pacifist tendencies'&lt;ref name="Kolarz"&gt;{{cite book| last =Kolarz | first = Walter | authorlink =Walter Kolarz | title =Religion in the Soviet Union |publisher =St. Martin's Press |series =Armenian Research Center collection | year = 1962 | pages = 470–473 {{Subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}}|url =https://www.questia.com/read/419296/religion-in-the-soviet-union}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Russia in 1938 "monstrous accusations" against Bahá'ís and a [[Religion in the Soviet Union#Policy toward religions in practice|Soviet government policy of oppression]] of religion resulted in Bahá'í communities in 38 cities across Soviet territories ceasing to exist.&lt;ref name="hass"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110706164853/http://bahai-studies.ca/journal/files/jbs/5.3%20Hassall.pdf "Notes on the Bábí and Bahá'í Religions in Russia and its Territories"], by Graham Hassall, Journal of Bahá'í Studies, 5.3 (Sept.-Dec. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; However the religion recovered in both countries. The religion has generally spread such that in recent years the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] estimated the Bahá'ís in European countries to number in hundreds to tens of thousands.&lt;ref name="WCE-10"&gt;{{cite web| title = Most Baha'i Nations (2010) | work = QuickLists → Compare Nations → Religions | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives |year = 2010| url =http://www.thearda.com/QL2010/QuickList_40c.asp| accessdate =26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam]] came to parts of European islands and coasts on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] during the 8th-century [[Muslim conquests]]. In the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and parts of southern [[France]], various Muslim states existed before the [[Reconquista]]; [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Islam spread in southern Italy]] briefly through the [[Emirate of Sicily]] and [[Emirate of Bari]]. During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] expansion, Islam was spread from into the [[Balkan]]s and even part of [[central Europe]]. Muslims have also been historically present in [[Ukraine]] ([[Crimea]] and vicinity, with the [[Crimean Tatars]]), as well as modern-day [[Russia]], beginning with [[Volga Bulgaria]] in the 10th century and the conversion of the [[Golden Horde]] to Islam. In recent years, Muslims have [[human migration|migrated]] to Europe as residents and temporary workers.

According to the [[Pew Forum]], the total number of [[Muslims]] in [[Europe]] in 2010 was about 44 million (6%).&lt;ref name="pewforum2011" &gt;[[Pew Forum]], The Future of the Global Muslim Population, January 2011, [http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/the-future-of-the-global-muslim-population/][http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/the-future-of-the-global-muslim-population/][http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/the-future-of-the-global-muslim-population/], [http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/table-muslim-population-by-country/], [http://www.pewforum.org/2011/01/27/the-future-of-the-global-muslim-population/]&lt;/ref&gt; While the total number of Muslims in the [[European Union]] in 2007 was about 16 million (3.2%).&lt;ref name="islam.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islam.de/8368.php|title=In Europa leben gegenwärtig knapp 53 Millionen Muslime|trans-title=Almost 53 million Muslims live in Europe at present|language=de|publisher=islam.de|date=8 May 2007|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 20th and early 21st centuries, [[atheism]] and [[agnosticism]] have increased, with falling church attendance and membership in various European countries.&lt;ref name="Zuckerman Atheism"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zuckerman|first=Phil|authorlink=|title=Atheism: Contemporary Rates and Patterns|work=|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2005|url=http://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/zuckerman/Ath-Chap-under-7000.pdf|doi=|accessdate=2007-07-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612114443/http://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/zuckerman/Ath-Chap-under-7000.pdf|archivedate=12 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 Eurobarometer survey found that on total average, of the [[2007 enlargement of the European Union|EU28]] population, 51% "believe there is a God", 26% "believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 20% "don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force".&lt;ref name="eurobarometer 2010"/&gt;
Across the EU, belief was higher among women, increased with age, those with strict upbringing, those with the lowest levels of formal education and those leaning towards [[right-wing politics]].&lt;ref name="Eurostat Religion"/&gt;{{Rp|10–11}} Results were varied widely between different countries.&lt;ref name="eurobarometer 2010"/&gt;

According to a survey measuring religious identification in the [[European Union]] in 2012 by [[Eurobarometer]], 7% of EU citizens identify themselves as [[Atheism|atheists]].&lt;ref name="euroreligion2012"/&gt; As of 2012, the top eight European countries with people who viewed themselves as "atheists" were the [[Czech Republic]] (20%), [[France]] (16%), [[Slovenia]] (16%), [[Estonia]] (15%), [[Sweden]] (13%), [[Spain]] (10%), [[Germany]] (9%) and [[Denmark]] (9%).&lt;ref name="euroreligion2012"/&gt;

===Germanic indigenous religion===
{{Main article|Germanic neopaganism}}
{{Further information|Heathenry in the United Kingdom|Neopaganism in Scandinavia|Neopaganism in Germany and Austria|Neopaganism in Latin Europe}}
Heathenism or Esetroth (Icelandic: ''Ásatrú''), and the organised form [[Odinism]], are names for the modern [[Germanic paganism|folk religion of the Germanic nations]].

In the [[United Kingdom Census 2001]], 300 people registered as Heathen in [[England and Wales]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Blain, Jenny (2005). "Heathenry, the Past, and Sacred Sites in Today's Britain". In Strmiska, Michael F. ''Modern Paganism in World Cultures''. Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO. pp. 181–208. {{ISBN|978-1-85109-608-4}}. p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; However, many Heathens followed the advice of the [[Pagan Federation]] (PF) and simply described themselves as "Pagan", while other Heathens did not specify their religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]], 1,958 people self-identified as Heathen in England and Wales. A further 251 described themselves as Reconstructionist and may include some people reconstructing Germanic paganism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Office for National Statistics]], 11 December 2012, ''[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?newquery=%2A&amp;newoffset=25&amp;pageSize=25&amp;edition=tcm%3A77-286262 2011 Census, Key Statistics for Local Authorities in England and Wales]''. Accessed 12 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Ásatrúarfélagið]]'' (Esetroth Fellowship) was recognized as an official religion by the [[Iceland]]ic government in 1973. For its first 20 years it was led by farmer and poet [[Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson]]. By 2003, it had 777 members,&lt;ref&gt;Strmiska, Michael F.; Sigurvinsson, Baldur A. (2005).

Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO. pp. 127–179. {{ISBN|978-1-85109-608-4}}. p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2014, it had 2,382 members, corresponding to 0.8% of Iceland's population.&lt;ref name="statice.is"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.statice.is/?PageID=1180&amp;src=/temp_en/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=MAN10001%26ti=Populations+by+religious+organizations+1998%2D2012+++++++%26path=../Database/mannfjoldi/Trufelog/%26lang=1%26units=Number | title = Populations by religious organizations 1998–2013 | publisher = [[Statistics Iceland]] | location  = Reykjavík, Iceland}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Iceland, Germanic religion has an impact larger than the number of its adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Strmiska, Michael F.; Sigurvinsson, Baldur A.

In Sweden, the ''[[Swedish Forn Sed Assembly]]'' (''Forn Sed'', or the archaic ''Forn Siðr'', means "Old Custom") was formed in 1994 and is since 2007 recognized as a religious organization by the Swedish government. In Denmark ''Forn Siðr'' was formed in 1999, and was officially recognized in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fornsidr.dk/dk/60|title=Forn Siðr - Forn Siðr|publisher=|accessdate=22 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430112124/http://www.fornsidr.dk/dk/60|archivedate=30 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Norwegian ''Åsatrufellesskapet Bifrost'' (Esetroth Fellowship Bifrost) was formed in 1996; as of 2011, the fellowship has some 300 members. ''Foreningen Forn Sed'' was formed in 1999, and has been recognized by the Norwegian government as a religious organization. In Spain there is the [[Odinist Community of Spain — Ásatrú]].

===Roman religion===
The [[Roman Polytheistic Reconstructionism|Roman polytheism]] also known as '''Religio Romana''' (''Roman religion'') in [[Latin]] or the '''Roman Way to the Gods''' (in [[Italian language|Italian]] 'Via romana agli Déi') is alive in small communities and loosely related organizations, mainly in [[Italy]].

===Druidry===
The religious development of [[Neo-Druidism|Druidry]] was largely influenced by [[Iolo Morganwg]].&lt;ref&gt;Grimoire for the Apprentice Wizard - Page 353, Oberon Zell-Ravenheart - 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Modern practises aim to imitate the practises of the Celtic peoples of the Iron Age.&lt;ref&gt;Bonewits 2006. pp. 128–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11463">[[Religion]] is one of many recurring themes on the [[United States|American]] animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]''.&lt;ref name="god"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/johnbowen/dare/simpsons.html |title=God and the Simpsons|last=Bowler|first=Gerry|year=2001|publisher=Talkback|accessdate=2008-11-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080615171325/http://individual.utoronto.ca/johnbowen/dare/simpsons.html |archivedate = 2008-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the series' religious humor satirizes aspects of [[Christianity]] and religion in general. However, some episodes, such as "[[Bart Sells His Soul]]" and "[[Alone Again, Natura-Diddily]]", can be interpreted as having a [[spirituality|spiritual]] theme. The show has been both praised and criticized by atheists, agnostics, liberals, conservatives and religious people in general for its portrayal of faith and religion in society. The show can function as a mediator of biblical literacy among younger generations of [[Irreligion|irreligious]] viewers.&lt;ref name="literacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4555717/Biblical_Literacy_and_the_Simpsons |title=Biblical Literacy and the Simpsons|last=Myles|first=Robert|year=2015|publisher=Rethinking Biblical Literacy|accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the series, the Simpson family attends services led by [[Reverend Lovejoy]]. The church's denomination is identified as the "Western Branch of American Reform Presbylutheranism" in the episode "[[The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star]]." This is generally interpreted as representing the multitude of American Protestant traditions in general and not one specific denomination.

==Analysis==
Although ''The Simpsons'' often mocks religion, it has received support from some groups claiming to be religious.  In a 2001 article for ''[[The Christian Century]]'', John Dart argued that &lt;blockquote&gt;"[T]he enormous popularity of ''The Simpsons'', now in its 12th television season, suggests that religious people have a sense of humor&amp;nbsp;— contrary to the usual wisdom in Hollywood. The program takes more satirical jabs at spiritual matters than any other TV show, yet the erratic cartoon family has an appreciative audience among many people of faith and among many analysts of religion. The reason? Perhaps it’s because ''The Simpsons'' is an equal-opportunity satire: it shrewdly targets all sorts of foibles and hypocrisies, not just religious ones. Perhaps it’s also because the show is exceptionally aware of the significant place religion has in the American landscape."&lt;ref name=Dart&gt;{{cite web|last=Dart|first=John|title=Simpsons Have Soul|url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=2113|work=[[The Christian Century]]|accessdate=2011-11-26|date=2001-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On December 2009, an article published in ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', the [[Holy See]]'s official newspaper, praised ''The Simpsons'' for its "realistic" way of dealing with religion. "[[Homer Simpson|Homer]] finds in God his last refuge, even though he sometimes gets His name sensationally wrong. But these are just minor mistakes, after all; the two know each other well", the article said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/vatican-praises-%5Cthe-simpsons%5C/380757/ "Vatican praises 'The Simpsons'"]. ''Business Standard''. December 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Simpson family is often seen attending church, a practice described by Dart as "rarely seen or mentioned in other TV shows."&lt;ref name=Dart/&gt; Simpsons creator [[Matt Groening]] has also stated that the Simpsons is one of the few shows on television where the family attends church regularly. The characters in the family are often seen [[prayer|praying]].&lt;ref name=Dart/&gt; William Romanowski, author of the book ''Pop Culture Wars: Religion and the Role of Entertainment in American Life'', noted that "''The Simpsons'' is not dismissive of faith, but treats religion as an integral part of American life. Episodes that I’ve seen are not so much irreverent toward religion, but poke fun at American attitudes and practices."&lt;ref name=Dart/&gt;

One episode that heavily features religion is "[[Bart Sells His Soul]]" (1995). While discussing ''The Simpsons'' treatment of religion in his ''Drawn to Television'' book, M. Keith Booker cites a scene from the episode where Milhouse asks Bart what religions have to gain by lying about concepts such as the existence of a soul&amp;nbsp;– and then the scene cuts to Reverend Lovejoy counting his money. Booker believes that this implies that religions create mythologies so that they can gain money from followers. He juxtaposes this with Bart's realization later in the episode that "life suddenly feels empty and incomplete" without a soul, which suggests "either that the soul is real or it is at least a useful fiction".&lt;ref name="booker"&gt;{{cite book  | last =Booker  | first =M.

'''Roger Haight''' (born 1936) is an American [[Jesuit]] theologian and former president of the [[Catholic Theological Society of America]]. He is regarded as a very knowledgeable and pioneering theologian, whose experiences with censorship have led to widespread debate over how to handle controversial ideas in the Catholic church today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2005a/022505/022505a.php|title=Cover story -- Theological Disputes: Doctrinal jousting|website=natcath.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Haight received his B.A. (1960) and the M.A. in Philosophy (1961) from Berchmans College, Cebu City, Philippines; his S.T.B. from [[Woodstock College]], Maryland (1967); the M.A. in Theology (1969) and the Ph.D. in Theology (1973) from the [[University of Chicago]]; and the S.T.L. from the Jesuit School of Theology at Chicago.

Haight was the recipient of the “Alumnus of the Year, 2005” award from the Divinity School of the University of Chicago in April, 2006. He taught at the Jesuit graduate schools of theology in Manila, Chicago, Toronto, and Cambridge, MA. He has also been a visiting professor in Lima, Nairobi, Paris, and in the Indian city of Pune.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://divinity.uchicago.edu/roger-haight|title=Roger Haight {{!}} The University of Chicago Divinity School|website=divinity.uchicago.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Vatican’s [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] (CDF) barred Haight from teaching at the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Weston School of Theology]] in response to questions about his book ''Jesus Symbol of God'' (Orbis, 1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20041213_notification-fr-haight_en.html|title=Notification on the book "Jesus Symbol of God" by Father Roger Haight S.J.|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is the winner of the 1999 top prize in theology from the U.S. [[Catholic Press Association]].

In September 2004, Haight began teaching at [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]], a leading multi-denominational seminary, as an adjunct professor of theology. In 2005 he wrote ''The Future of Christology'' in response to questions and concerns about ''Jesus Symbol of God''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicbooksreview.org/2006/haight.htm|title=Catholic  Books Review: Roger HAIGHT, The Future of Christology.|last=HEGY|first=Pierre|date=|website=www.catholicbooksreview.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) barred Haight from writing on theology and forbade him to teach anywhere, including non-Catholic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/vatican-levies-further-penalties-roger-haight-sj|title=The Vatican levies further penalties on Roger Haight, SJ {{!}} Commonweal Magazine|website=www.commonwealmagazine.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 he remained at Union Theological Seminary as a scholar in residence, focused on the adaptation of Ignatius' [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|Spiritual Exercises]] for "seekers" today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cswr.hds.harvard.edu/news/topic-tags/roger-haight|title=Roger Haight {{!}} Center for the Study of World Religions|website=cswr.hds.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the era of [[Pope Francis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2017/01/12/how-pope-francis-changing-catholic-church|title=How Pope Francis is changing the Catholic Church|date=2017-01-12|work=America Magazine|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haight was somewhat reinstated and teaching at the Jesuit theologate in [[Toronto]], Canada. His article on liberation theology was carried in a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://opcentral.org/resources/2015/01/12/roger-haight-spirituality-and-social-justice-a-christological-perspective/|title=Roger Haight: Spirituality and Social Justice: A Christological Perspective|website=opcentral.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had published, in 2014, ''An Alternate Vision: An Interpretation of Liberation Theology.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wipfandstock.com/author/view/detail/id/55745/|title=Roger  Haight|website=wipfandstock.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed to the Sisters of the Holy Name of Jesus and Mary series commemorating 50 years after Vatican II, with an interview on "Spirituality Today for all Seekers: The Gift of the Spiritual Exercises for All Seekers" which addresses the question of how to connect with the spirituality of people who do not consider themselves religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.snjmusontario.org/spirit-of-vatican-ii/1431-roger-haight-s-j-ph-d-s-t-l|title=Video interview with Roger Haight|last=Province|first=SNJM U.S.-Ontario|date=|work=|access-date=2017-12-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 he published ''Spiritual and Religious: Explorations for Seekers,'' and in 2017 his "Theology of the Cross" was the topic of an article in the English Jesuit ''Heythrop Journal.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2265.2009.00525.x/pdf|title=Theology of the Cross|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critiques of ''Jesus Symbol of God'' ==
The CDF objected to Haight’s attempts to separate Christology from Greek philosophical concepts, specifically in relation to the formulation of the mystery of the Trinity, the interpretation of Christ’s divinity, and the role of Jesus in salvation. The clarifications Haight provided in 2000 were judged unsatisfactory by the CDF and in January 2001 it initiated a formal investigation which led to his 2004 removal from Catholic universities and 2009 complete silencing.

In 2005 John Allen, after a long review of diverse responses to Haight's ''Jesus'' ''Symbol of God,'' described it as "a work of vast erudition", and concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The theological community appears divided over the Vatican’s recent censure of Jesuit Fr. Roger Haight. Citing “grave doctrinal errors” in Haight’s book ''Jesus Symbol of God'', the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a notification banning the priest from teaching Catholic theology. While some see Haight’s “Christology from below” as a courageous exploration of new horizons, others see it as a cautionary tale about what happens when the culture becomes the lens for reading the Gospel rather than vice versa. Some who fault Haight have included those who have been critical of Vatican treatment of other theologians, but reluctantly concede that the congregation’s notification of Haight may be justified, or at least expected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scholars are divided on whether Rome's reaction is counterproductive by ending debate within scholarly circles or whether it was necessary since Haight's ideas were being taught at a popular level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2009 after the complete silencing of Haight, a response in the Jesuit's ''America'' magazine mentioned the usefulness of certain chapters of ''Jesus Symbol of God'' and that silencing interrupts the helpful process of scholarly criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/content/all-things/silencing-roger-haight-sj|title=The Silenc/ing of Roger Haight, SJ|date=2009-01-24|work=America Magazine|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The silencing received widespread coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.christiancentury.org/category/keywords/roger-haight|title=Roger Haight|work=The Christian Century|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.onfaith.co/onfaith/2009/01/12/not-two-catholic-peas-in-a-pod/8482|title=Losing Haight and Neuhaus - OnFaith|date=2009-01-12|work=OnFaith|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://homebrewedchristianity.com/2015/09/21/a-postmodern-apologetic-christology-with-roger-haight/|title=A Postmodern Apologetic Christology with Roger Haight|website=homebrewedchristianity.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swiss Sikhs''' are a small religious minority in [[Switzerland]], numbering no more than 500, with four  [[gurdwara]]s. The number of Sikhs had been higher in the mid-1980s, caused by the presence of some 3,000 Sikh asylum seekers.&lt;ref name="Gurdwaras in Switzerland"&gt;[http://www.allaboutsikhs.com/gurudwaras/gurudwaras-in-switzerland.html Gurdwaras in Switzerland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118093000/http://www.allaboutsikhs.com/gurudwaras/gurudwaras-in-switzerland.html |date=2008-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious practice within [[Spiritism]] is mostly limited to praying. All other activities are seen as not religious, but as charitable work. Spiritist meetings are not for worshipping.

==Membership==
All practices taking place within the centres are free of charge, adhering to the Gospel principle that we must "Give for free what we receive for free." Attendees may actually be asked for contribution if they become regular, but generally only if they become formal members - which is more or less the same process as enlisting with a political party.

==The Spiritist centre==

The practice of Spiritism is held without exterior trappings, within the Christian principle that God should be adored in spirit and truth. A Spiritist Centre has no exterior mark of its use, except for a (usually discreet) plate or sign bearing its name (often that of the founder or of a spiritual patron). They do not use icons, idols, crosses, pictures, etc. The presence of any such objects in a place purporting to practice Kardecist Spiritism is sometimes considered the surest proof they are not what they claim to be, as [[The Spirits Book|The Spirits' Book]] clearly states that spirits actually do not have any recognisable form (unless they have disincarnated recently). 

==Ministry==

There is no ministry within Spiritism; neither does it adopt or use in its meetings or in its practices any of the following: vestments, alcoholic beverages, incense, tobacco, altars, banners, candles, processions, talismans, amulets, sacraments, the making of promises and the paying of penances, horoscopes, fortune telling with cards or sea shells, pyramids, crystals, rituals or any other form of material support. However, Spiritist Centres usually are dedicated buildings, in the sense that they usually must follow some architectural guidelines. People willing to take part in mediunic meetings are often asked not to eat meat or ingest alcohol, coffee or drugs (including tobacco) beforehand, though such is not strictly forbidden.

==Proselytism==
Spiritism does not impose its principles. It invites all those who are interested in getting to know them to submit its teachings to the test of reason before accepting them. Spiritists believe salvation is achieved by work and that any formal (or informal) religion is valid if it follows the basic commandments of [[God]] and helps people endure the hardships of life. Affiliation to Spiritism is, therefore, regarded as an option for those who do not feel their religious needs fulfilled.

==Mediumship==
Mediumship, which permits the Spirits to communicate with Man, is a gift which effectively everyone has, independent of doctrinal guidance. Fully developed mediumship, however, is a rarer gift that must often be developed. Spiritist Mediumship is only that which is practiced based upon the principles of the Spiritist Doctrine and within Christian morality (generally, it mustn't be done for money, fame or vanity).{{Fact|date=December 2007}}).

==Social campaigns==
There is a strong campaign against [[abortion]], [[capital punishment]] and [[suicide]]. Spiritists believe abortion is murder and that suicide is an act of ignorance that leads to worsening of the conditions of a future life. 

==Prayer==
[[Prayer]] is deemed to be important to allow oneself to stay in tune with his spiritual friends and protectors. It is especially useful to fight or prevent [[Obsession (Spiritism)|obsession]]. Praying helps to clear the mind of bad feelings and prepares the spirit for higher achievements. The prayer does not need to follow a strict formula, but should come from within the follower, and it should express their true belief in, and dedication to, God. Spiritist prayer is not formulaic, but reflects the person's current state of mind, much like [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] prayer. The most frequent subject of prayer is asking for the guidance of God.

==Charity==
Doing charity work is of utmost importance. According to the doctrine, we should be willing to donate not only material resources, but also the better share of our love and care for the less fortunate.

==Culture==
Spiritists are prompted to read a lot. Spiritist Centres usually have libraries and many publishing houses distribute cheap paperback editions of a myriad books in all genres, including literature, science, philosophy, history, poetry, etc. Spiritist authors are often expected to donate their copyright to works of charity or charge low amounts for it (as the purpose of a book is to be read and many people can't afford to buy expensive books).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9291">In Azerbaijan, there are three main Jewish communities - [[mountain Jews]], [[Ashkenazi Jews]] and communities of [[Georgian Jews]]. The total number of Jews in the country is 16,000. Of these, 11,000 are mountain Jews, about 6,000 in [[Baku]], 4,000 in [[Quba|Guba]] and thousands in other cities. [[Ashkenazi Jews]] are 4.3 thousand people. Most of them live in [[Baku]] and Sumgayit. The Georgian Jews are about 700.

Q.Zelmanovich said that there are 10 synagogues in [[Azerbaijan]]. Two of the synagogues are located in [[Baku]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://samgrubersjewishartmonuments.blogspot.com/2011/04/azerbaijan-new-synagogue-in-baku.html|title=Azerbaijan: New Synagogue in Baku|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; six of them in Guba and two of them in [[Oğuz (city)|Oguz]]:

"Synagogues have been built mainly in areas where Jews live. One of the synagogues in [[Baku]] was built in 2003 and another in 2012. Jews living in [[Azerbaijan]], every day worship in the synagogue, celebrate their festivals, hold mourning ceremonies." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/synagogues-of-azerbaijan|title=Synagogues in Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://simsar.az/news/a-22296.html|title=Azərbaycanda 10 sinaqoq var|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jns.org/latest-articles/2015/11/12/jewish-life-in-azerbaijan-embodies-muslim-majority-nations-culture-of-tolerance|title=Jewish life in Azerbaijan embodies Muslim-majority nation’s culture of tolerance|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synagogue of Mountain Jews ==
The building of the Mountain Jews Synagogue in Baku has been functioning since 1945. During the Soviet era, after the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], mountain Jews were given an ancient building for religious needs in the center of the city. The condition of the building was very damaging, and those who worshiped here were suffering from unpleasantness. This situation continued until [[Azerbaijan]] gained independence. During the period of independence, repair and restoration works were started, the second floor of the synagogue was built, and favorable conditions were created for worshipers.

In connection with the reconstruction and capital rehabilitation works carried out, there was a need for a new synagogue for Mountain Jews and has been functioning in [[Baku]] in 2010. The opening ceremony of the new temple for the Mountain Jews was held on April 5, 2011. According to the architectural features and dimensions, officials, heads of religious confessions functioning in [[Azerbaijan]], members of the Jewish community, as well as guests from [[Israel]], [[Russia]] and other countries attended in opening ceremony of other Jewish temples’ synagogue not only in [[Azerbaijan]] but also in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eajc.org/page423|title=GENERAL INFORMATION ON AZERBAIJANI JEWISH ORGANIZATIONS|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewisheritage.org/web/routes/pdfs/azerbaijan_jewish_heritage_guide.pdf|title=European Routes of Jewish heritage - Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== European and Georgian Jews Synagogues ==
The synagogue of Jews of [[Europe]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], located at [[Baku]], was opened on March 9, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai111_folder/111_articles/111_news_synagogue.html|title=New Jewish Synagogue Opens in Baku|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple was built based on the project of the architect Alexander Karberin. This place of worship is considered to be the first synagogue built in the [[Near East]] in 60–80 years.

This building, considered to be one of the largest synagogues in Europe, was erected instead of  the old temple. After the Second World War, Soviet Power gave a one-storey building with ancient military warehouses to Georgian and European Jews for religious needs. Here men went down cold and damp basement for praying, and women prayed in the upper room. The balcony of the building was also given to women.

At present, in three-storied, new synagogue built from white stone has created comfortable conditions for believers. People from different religions and classes participated in the synagogue construction. The name of  each person and organization that has been worked in the project is engraved on boards at the entrance of the temple. Not only Jewish organizations living abroad, but also Caucasian Muslims Office and the [[Baku]] and [[Russian Orthodox Church in Azerbaijan]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azerb.com/az-wors.html|title=Many religious buildings|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been closely participated in financing the construction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Gilaki Synagogue located at Red Village ==
The Gilaki synagogue, located in the Red settlement in Guba region, was built by immigrants from the Gilan Province of Iran. The architect of the temple is Gilel Ben Haim. His name was engraved on the brick facade of the synagogue. It is clear from the inscription on the foundation stone that the temple was erected in 1896. There is also another board on the entrance door. And here is written another date - 1857. Perhaps this board was brought from the more ancient temple of the Jewish emigrants and was put on the door of the synagogue.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:The Summer Synagogue in Quba.jpg|thumb|The Summer Synagogue in Quba]]
There are 12 windows in the synagogue building, according to the number of Israel branch. From historical sources it is known that earlier there was a spring near the synagogue. It is likely that the mosque built in Guba in the first half of the 19th century was a prototype for the temple of Gilaki, because the hexagonal dome was once a glass and illuminated the prayer room. Anological roofing is also available at the Guba mosque. In the past, there were no separate rooms for women in the Gilaki synagogue as in the other temples of mountain Jews. Women only came in here during the holidays and sat in the yard of the synagogue. At present, women are allowed to enter the temple during holidays.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Six Dome Synagogues in Red Town ==
A synagogue in the [[Rad (village)|Red Village]] of Guba District was built in 1888 by architect Gilel Ben Haim. Six dome (synagogue is also hexagonal) is a symbol of immigrating of the residents of Qilhat settlement here from the village of Galaduz during 6 days with the permission of Huseynali Khan of Guba. The temple has 14 main windows.

The synagogue, a large worship hall, is an ancient architectural monument built in the Eastern style. The section facing the wall of worship is called aron-kadus. Its height is 7 meters. The Holy book is kept in a wardrobe on the wall.

The windows are made of oak tree in shape of  hexagonal star. The restoration of the synagogue began in 1995 and was completed in October 2000. There is also a 60-person worship hall and a kitchen for religious ceremonies at the temple's cellar.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azernews.az/travel/67543.html|title=Krasnaya Sloboda – unique settlement of Jews in Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-synagogue-in-qrmz-qsb-or-red-town-quba-district-of-azerbaijan-qrmz-140076783.html|title=Pictures from Six Dome Synagogues|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Upper Quarter of synagogue ==
The Upper Quarter of Synagogue located at Oguz city was built in 1897 by  helping and heading of Ravvin Barukh. In the [[Soviet-era|Soviet era]], this synagogue was also closed as other places of worship, and later used as a warehouse.

In October 2004, the synagogue was begun to repaired by local Jews living in [[Oğuz (city)|Oguz]], and the renovation was completed in 2006. The synagogue is now used as a temple. On the Friday and Saturday, the Jews worship freely.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/projects/out-of-eden-walk/articles/2016-01-fading-echoes-of-jewish-life-in-muslim-azerbaijan/|title=Fading Echoes of Jewish Life in Muslim Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lower Quarter of synagogue ==
The Lower Quarter of Synagogue in [[Oğuz (city)|Oguz city,]] was built in 1849. This synagogue was used as a tobacco and furniture warehouse during the Soviet era. The synagogue began to repaire by local Jews in 1992 and ended in 1994.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3789">'''Sülde Tngri''' is an equestrian war god,&lt;ref name="Agnes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birtalan|first=&amp;Aacute;gnes|year=2011|title=The representation of the Mongolian shaman deity Dayan Deerh in invocations and in a Buddhist scroll painting|journal=Études Mongoles &amp; Sibériennes, Centrasiatiques &amp; Tibétaines|volume=42|url=http://emscat.revues.org/index1800.html|doi=10.4000/emscat.1800}}
&lt;/ref&gt; one of the [[tngri]], the highest group of divinities in [[Mongolian shamanism]].&lt;ref name="Walther"/&gt; He is usually depicted as an armored warrior riding a horse.&lt;ref name="Isabelle"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Charleux|first=Isabelle|year=2009|title=Chinggis Khan: Ancestor, Buddha or Shaman?|journal=[[Mongolian Studies]]|volume=31|pages=207–58|url=http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/61/38/28/PDF/2009_GK_Mongolian_studies_PDF.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mongolian shamanism, everyone possesses a guardian spirit, called a [[sülde]]. "Sülde Tngri" can refer to the sülde of any great leader, but it primarily refers to the deified sülde of [[Genghis Khan]]. As a war god, Sülde Tngri's primary function is protecting his devotees from their enemies and aiding them in battles against their foes.&lt;ref name="Walther"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heissig|first=Walther|authorlink=Walther Heissig|title=The Religions of Mongolia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OzDMbpw7EecC&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=19 August 2012|year=1980|publisher=U of California P|isbn=9780520038578|pages=84–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Descriptions and appearance ==
The exact details of Sülde Tngri's appearance and entourage vary among artwork of him.  He has been illustrated as a man wearing armor and a helmet adorned by triangular flags or banners, armed with a club and wreathed in fire. He is mounted on a yellow horse, tended to by a servant clothed in white. In this portrayal, he has a demon held captive.  Another description has Sülde Tngri clothed in white silk and carrying both a spear and a lance, riding a white horse. In other images, he has been represented by a man with a spear and a flag, riding a horse.&lt;ref name="Isabelle"/&gt;

== Rituals and symbolism ==
Sülde Tngri's primary sphere of influence is protection from mortal enemies. Rituals invoking his aid usually describe him and his entourage only briefly, but some give more elaborate, detailed accounts of his interventions.&lt;ref name="Agnes"/&gt; He is the major local god around the [[Muna, Nepal|Muna community]], although his status as a minor god elsewhere is simultaneously acknowledged.&lt;ref name="Isabelle"/&gt;

=== Association with Genghis Khan ===
Sülde Tngri is most often identified with [[Genghis Khan]].&lt;ref name="Isabelle2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Charleux|first=Isabelle|editor=Roberte Hamayon|others=Isabelle Charleux, Grégory Delaplace, and Scott Pearce|title=Representing Power in Ancient Inner Asia: Legitimacy, Transmission and the Sacred|url=http://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/57/06/22/PDF/2010_From_ongon_to_icon_PDF.pdf|year=2010|publisher=Western Washington University|location=Bellingham|pages=209–61|chapter=From ongon to icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his sülde, Sülde Tngri represents the embodiment of Genghis Khan in his martial character, excluding the other aspects of the historical figure's personality.&lt;ref name="Isabelle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Isabelle2"/&gt;  The white horse that sometimes appears in descriptions of Sülde Tngri has been thought to represent Genghis's deified horse.  In illustrations, the god and the mortal man resemble each other; this has created some confusion over which entity is being portrayed. Sülde Tngri is also sometimes confused with similar equestrian warrior deities, such as [[Dayisun Tngri]].&lt;ref name="Isabelle"/&gt;

The '''Talaja Caves''' are located in [[Bhavnagar district]] of the [[India]]n state of [[Gujarat]] at [[Talaja]]. The rock cuts are carved out into deserted conical rocks. The rock cut group include 30 caves among which about 15 are water tanks. The cave has unique architecture known as ''Ebhal Mandapa''. The halls are plain. "On the facade there are chaitya windows with a broad bank  below them."  The [[chaitya]] and cells were carved  during [[Buddhism]] influence in 2nd century BC. During the [[Kshatrapas]]' regime in 2nd-3rd century AD  [[Jainism]] emblems were carved on the cells and the halls.&lt;ref name=Archaeological&gt;{{cite web|last=Archaeological Survey of India, Vadodara Circle|title=Talaja Caves|url=http://www.asivadodaracircle.in/sites/talaja-caves/about|publisher=Archaeological Survey of India|accessdate=1 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235434/http://www.asivadodaracircle.in/sites/talaja-caves/about|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''TheMarker''''' ({{lang-he|דה-מרקר}}) is a Hebrew-language daily business newspaper published by the [[Haaretz]] group in Israel.

''TheMarker'' was founded in 1999 by journalist and entrepreneur [[Guy Rolnik]] along with [[Haaretz]] group and U.S.-based investors. 5 Years after ''TheMarker'' launched, Haaretz newspaper group decided to terminate its long-standing business section and relaunch it as a daily print newspapers called “''TheMarker''”, the brand that was created online.

The chief editor of ''TheMarker'' is Sami Peretz. The editor of the monthly magazine is [[Eytan Avriel]]. ''TheMarker'' alone has about 250 employees. It operates from ''Haaretz'' newspaper building in Tel Aviv.

In 2006 and 2007 ''TheMarker'' and Rolnik won the 2 most important awards in marketing and business strategy for creating ''TheMarker'', turning it into the leading brand in financial media and using an internet brand to launch a print newspaper (see “Awards”).

Currently ''TheMarker'' produces a website, a daily print newspaper, a monthly print magazine and holds events on business-related issues. Some of ''TheMarker''’s articles are translated to English and appear in the English version of Haaretz in cooperation with the [[International New York Times]].

==History==

''TheMarker'', founded by Rolnik and Haaretz group, was incorporated in 1999 and launched in March 2000. Joined by his two friends and co-founders – Avriel and Ido Pollak – Rolnik launched what would become the first business news website and the first online newsroom in Israel. In 2001 ''TheMarker'' started publishing a monthly print magazine, ''TheMarker Magazine''. The magazine publishes yearly lists of “Israel’s 100 most influential people” and “Israel’s 500 richest people”, which draw considerable attention. In 2003 started organizing business-related events under its own brand.

In 2005 Haaretz daily newspaper's economic section was terminated and Haaretz launched “''TheMarker''” as a daily newspaper.

Following the relaunch, the number of Haaretz's paid subscribers increased significantly: by the end of 2006, the number of paid subscribers rose to all-time high of over 60,000 and ad revenues from ''TheMarker''’s print edition grew by 50% compared to the pre-rebranding Period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.themarker.com/advertising/1.411671|title= TheMarker זכה בפרס האפי פלטינום - המהלך השיווקי העסקי הטוב ביותר ב-5 השנים האחרונות|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the print edition of ''TheMarker'' became available as a stand-alone product as well.

In 2007 ''TheMarker'' launched “''TheMarker Café''”, Israel’s first social network for grown-ups and the first launched by a news organization.

==''TheMarker''’s campaigns==

''TheMarker'' is known for its journalistic campaigns. Believing that the role of a newspaper is to push politicians into taking on powerful special interest groups, ''TheMarker''’s prolonged campaigns, usually consisting of dozens of long-form essays, articles and analyses packed with data, were able to put issues on the agenda, prime them to attract the attention of the public, regulators and politicians and present them in a way that would get support.

Over the years, the newspaper identified many of the basic structural problems in Israel’s economy and society and campaigned for their reform. Some of ''TheMarker''’s campaigns were met with objection or counter-campaigns by other media outlets that are linked to big Israel business groups or political figures. Nevertheless, many of the issues ''TheMarker'' campaigned for were later incorporated into government decisions and laws.

Rolnik's profile on an independent Israeli watchdog states that “during the first decade following its founding, ''TheMarker'' was a lone journalistic voice in a line of battles against the connections between the government and powerful businesspeople and the concentration of economic and political power in the hands of few. Following the 2011 social protests, during which some of Rolnik’s and ''TheMarker''’s gained wide public recognition, some other media outlets began adopting some of the ideas he led. Rolnik’s and ''TheMarker''’s campaigns yielded at least seven major economic reforms: (1) the implementation of the recommendations of the [[Bejski Commission]] – ending banks’ control of capital markets (2) the introduction of competition in the cellular market (3) increasing taxes on Israel's natural resources (The Sheshinski Committee) (4) preventing the bailout of tycoons with Israeli taxpayers and savers money following the 2008 financial crisis (5) the creation of Israel's [[Israel's Anti-Concentration Law|Anti-Concentration Committee]] (6) the creation of the Strum Committee for the introduction of competition in the banking sector, and (7) exposing the corruption in both the IDB and Bank Hapoalim groups during the reign of the Dankner family, which led to their indictments, convictions and removal from their positions".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the7eye.org.il/lexicon/48562 רולניק, גיא | העין השביעית].

===Banking reform===

The banking sector has always been a central point of interest for ''TheMarker''. ''TheMarker'' is particularly interested in the political power of banks and their influence on the media, political parties, experts and the business sector and the lack of competition in the banking sector itself.

1983 saw the first major banking crisis in Israel's history, “[[1983 Israel bank stock crisis|the manipulation crisis]]”. In the years leading up to the crisis, almost all major Israeli banks manipulated their own stock prices. Eventually, in October 1983, their stock prices collapsed and pushed the whole stock market into a crash. In order to restore confidence in the financial system, the government nationalized the manipulating banks and formed an inquiry committee that was named “the Bejski Committee”, after its chairman, Supreme Court judge [[Moshe Bejski]]. That crisis made Israelis wary of banks since.

Israel's banking sector has long been controlled by two major banks, [[Bank Hapoalim]] and [[Bank Leumi]]. As of 2015, Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi held each about 30% of the banking sector's total assets, or about 60% together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boi.org.il/Lists/BoiChapterTablesByYears/bankco15/iii10.xls BALANCE SHEETS OF ORDINARY BANKING CORPORATIONS (ON BANK BASIS), 2014 - 2015]. Bank of Israel. Retrieved 2016-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, Israel's banks also owned the biggest money-management companies, mainly [[Mutual Fund|mutual funds]] and two other major types of saving funds that are unique to Israel (“Kupot Gemel” and “Kranot Hishtalmut”). They were also major players in securities underwriting held controlling stakes in other financial institutions, mainly insurance companies, as well as real sector companies.

A major recommendation of the Bejski Committee was that banks should not be allowed to own money-management corporations, such as mutual funds, a recommendation that banks fiercely objected to and that was not adopted at the time.

For many years, ''TheMarker'' maintained that this structure leads to a conflict of interests between the banks and their customers, significant inefficiencies, suboptimal yields for savers, higher management fees and a distortion of the allocation of capital, and campaigned for increased competition in banking by divestiture of certain assets and the addition of more players in the remaining areas. In its campaign, ''TheMarker'' reiterated its support of the Bejski Committee recommendations and used them to push then Finance Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] to promote reform.

In April 2004, Netanyahu ordered the forming of a committee that was tasked with recommending steps to increase competition in the capital markets.&lt;ref&gt;http://ozar.mof.gov.il/bachar/asp/tamtzit1.asp. Israel’s Finance Ministry (Hebrew). Retrieved 2016-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The banks and most mainstream newspapers strongly opposed the forming of the committee. The committee's main recommendation was the same as Bejski's: to force banks to sell their money-management corporations, which most of them did almost immediately after the recommendations were enacted into law in August 2005. The three laws associated with the recommendations were confirmed in the [[Knesset]] with overwhelming majority.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.knesset.gov.il/vote/heb/Vote_Res_Map.asp?vote_id_t=5126. Israel’s Knesset (Hebrew). Retrieved 2016-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.knesset.gov.il/vote/heb/Vote_Res_Map.asp?vote_id_t=5128. Israel’s Knesset (Hebrew).

Following the divestitures, the new, non-bank, owners of the money-management corporations increased management fees considerably, only to decrease them later to the pre-reform levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.themarker.com/markets/1.2803605|title= עשור לרפורמת בכר: מה נשאר מהמהלך הנועז של בנימין נתניהו ואריאל שרון|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proceeds from the sales also helped Israeli banks whether the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global 2007-2008 financial crisis]].

The reform significantly increased the stream of non-bank credit to the Israeli business sector. According to [[Bank of Israel]] data, following the reform, between December 2004 and December 2009, non-bank credit to the business sector almost doubled – from 167 billion shekels to 342 billion shekels, while bank credit increased 10%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boi.org.il/he/Research/ConferencesAndSeminars/Documents/neum345h2.pps האשראי הבנקאי והחוץ-בנקאי לאחר המשבר]. Bank of Israel (Hebrew). Retrieved 2016-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concentration of economic and political power===

Following the Financial crisis of 2007-2008, which exposed the vulnerability of Israel's biggest corporations and their interdependence, ''TheMarker'' started campaigning against the concentration of economic and political power in few businesspeople who control many big corporations that span many areas of activity. In these articles, those businesspeople were described as “tycoons”, a term that became to bear resemblance to “[[Robber baron (industrialist)|Robber barons]]”.

''TheMarker'' repeatedly pointed out to the level of concentration and its dangers and to the pyramidal structure of many of Israel's big business conglomerates and called for dismantling them.

In October 24, 2010, Prime Minister Netanyahu formed “The Committee on Increasing Competitiveness in the Economy”, better known as “The Concentration Committee”. As some of its leading members left, the committee's work almost came to a halt. But following the July 2011 wave of [[2011 Israeli social justice protests|social protests]], which adopted ''TheMarker''’s fight against concentration, Netanyahu appointed new members and the committee handed its final recommendations in February 2012.

Following the recommendations, on December 9, 2013, the Israel’s Knesset approved “The Law for Promotion of Competition and Reduction of Concentration”, better known as “The Anti-Concentration Law”, with no objections and included both coalition and opposition parties:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.knesset.gov.il/vote/heb/Vote_Res_Map.asp?vote_id_t=19913. Israel’s Knesset (Hebrew). Retrieved 2016-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; 42 coalition Knesset members and 30 opposition Knesset members voted for the law, an extremely rare result in the Knesset's history.

The law's two main features were to limit the ability to control corporations via a pyramidal structure and forcing a separation between significant financial corporations and significant non-financial corporations.

The law and ''TheMarker''’s campaign met with strong objection from many Israeli newspapers, but was commended by the global press. In a January 7, 2014, New York Times article titled “Overhaul of Israel’s Economy Offers Lessons for United States” Steven Davidoff wrote that “with a single bill and a few big changes in its corporate law, Israel is looking to overhaul its economy and hopefully reduce income inequality”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/overhaul-of-israels-economy-offers-lessons-for-united-states/|title=Overhaul of Israel’s Economy Offers Lessons for United States|newspaper=New York Times|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; An October 15, 2015 article in Financial Times stated that: “…it is the role that the business newspaper ''TheMarker'' has played in Israel in exposing the effect on the national economy of the concentration of power and wealth in the hands of a few billionaires”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.ft.com/content/8843ca9e-70f5-11e5-9b9e-690fdae72044|title= A strong press is best defence against crony capitalism|newspaper=Financial Times|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===“The Connected”===

In relation to the campaign against concentration, ''TheMarker'' wrote extensively about small groups whose members were connected to power and resources. Those included, among others, people with connections to the top political parties, people who worked at Israel's biggest state-owned and private monopolies, such as [[Israel Electric Corporation]] and the major banks and many salaried military personnel employed in non-combative positions. The people enjoyed good wages, job security and generous retirement plans, were able to maintain their power regardless of how the economy was doing and, in many cases, pass these privileges onto their children via [[Nepotism|nepotistic]] practices.

In many articles, ''TheMarker'' characterized and identified this groups, stressing that all their privileges are earned at the expenses of “the unconnected” – the vast majority of Israelis. And lust like the tycoons, the connected were able to control much more economic and political power than their share in the population would imply.

===Danny Dankner===

Danny Dankner is a member of a family with deep and historic roots in Israel's business sector. In 1997 his family was part of a group that bought the controlling stake in Bank Hapoalim. His family later sold its stake, but Dankner remained on the bank's board of directors and was named the chairman in 2007.

The [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis of 2007-2008]], that occurred when Dankner was chairman, exposed many ill-fated decisions made by the bank as well as private transactions that Dankner made and were considered dubious. Some were self-dealings, such as a transaction involving Bank Hapoalim, a Turkish bank and an Israeli-owned fund that transacted with a publicly-traded company co-controlled by Dankner;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.themarker.com/markets/1.1798118|title= סניגוריו של דני דנקנר הגיעו לשימוע בפרקליטות בעניין פרשת RP|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a loan made to Dankner by Bank Hapoalim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/law/1.1159624|title= מנכ"ל בנק הפועלים ציון קינן נחקר באזהרה בפרשת דני דנקנר|newspaper=Haaretz (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also later revealed that Danny Dankner secretly owed 60 million shekels (approx. $17 million) to his cousin, [[Nochi Dankner]], who was at the time the strongest businessman in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.themarker.com/markets/1.2506363|title= השרבוט של דנקנר עלול לסבך גם את בנק הפועלים|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, ''TheMarker'' reported that the then Governor of the Bank of Israel, [[Stanley Fischer]], met secretly with [[Shari Arison]], the controlling shareholder of Bank Hapoalim, and demanded that she remove Danny Dankner from his position, saying that he lost confidence in Dankner following a string of apparent failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1256813|title= פישר לאריסון: דנקנר אחראי לתקלות בהפועלים|newspaper=Haaretz (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arison refused. Following the meeting and Arison's refusal, ''TheMarker'' with supported Fischer unequivocally while most other major newspapers took Arison's side and condemned Fischer's request. Eventually, on June 1, 2009, Dankner handed his resignation to Bank Hapoalim's board.&lt;ref&gt;http://maya.tase.co.il/reports/details/448598/2/0. Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (Hebrew). Retrieved 2016-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Dankner was charged, and finally convicted, in two separate cases, one related to his tenure at Bank Hapoalim. Nochi Dankner was also convicted. In November 2012, he was arrested&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.themarker.com/markets/1.1874460|title= החשד: דנקנר יזם ומימן תוכנית להעלות את שווי אי.די.בי לקראת ההנפקה|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; on suspicions regarding securities-related issues regarding a February 2012 share issue by the conglomerate he controlled and ran, IDB Holdings – a story ''TheMarker'' broke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.themarker.com/markets/1.1829570|title= החברים של דנקנר מציגים: כך הפסדנו מיליונים מכספי הציבור|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014 he was formally indicted,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-1.602021|title= Former IDB Head Nochi Dankner to Be Indicted for Securities Fraud |newspaper=Haaretz|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2016 he was found guilty of all charges&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/1.728834|title= Israeli Businessman Nochi Dankner Found Guilty of Stock Manipulation |newspaper=Haaretz|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on December 5, 2016, he was sentenced to two years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/1.757041|title= Israeli Ex-tycoon Nochi Dankner Sentenced to Two Years for Stock Manipulation |newspaper=Haaretz|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his efforts to fight ''TheMarker'' and influence regulators’ positions regarding concentration, in March 2011, Nochi Dankner's IDB bought [[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]], a daily newspaper. 18 months later the newspaper went bankrupt.

===The Sheshinski Committee===

In January 2009, a huge [[natural gas]] field, [[Tamar gas field|Tamar]], was found about 90 kilometers (approx. 55 miles) west of the Israeli city of Haifa. Later, a few more huge fields were discovered in other parts of the Mediterranean within Israel's [[Exclusive economic zone]].

These discoveries prompted a re-examination of Israel's energy-related taxes with an intent to raise them from their existing levels. ''TheMarker''’s position was that Israel should raise the taxes to levels that would be at par with other nations.

In order to handle the situation, the then Finance Minister [[Yuval Steinitz]] formed a committee headed by renowned economist prof. Eytan Sheshinski. The committee published its final recommendations in January 2011. The recommendations indeed meant that the state’s share of the revenues would be greater than in the existing law. On March 2011, the Knesset passed the law that effectively adopted the committee’s recommendations and raised taxing significantly. The law was confirmed with a significant majority: 78 Knesset members voted for it while only 2 objected.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.knesset.gov.il/vote/heb/Vote_Res_Map.asp?vote_id_t=15731. Israel’s Knesset (Hebrew). Retrieved 2016-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Cellular market===

For many years, Israel’s cellular market was controlled by three Providers – [[Pelephone]], [[Cellcom (Israel)|Cellcom]] and [[Partner Communications Company|Partner]] – who were also the major sellers of phones.

Starting in 2004, ''TheMarker'' pushed for increased competition in the cellular market by lowering [[Termination rates]], the fees charged by cellular providers for connecting calls from other providers, and failed to push communication ministers in this direction. In March 2009 [[Moshe Kahlon]] became the new Minister of Communications and ''TheMarker'' encouraged him to introduce competition into the market and supported him in his efforts as other newspapers opposed it.

The two major pieces in Kahlon’s reform were introducing [[Mobile virtual network operator|Mobile Virtual Network Operators]] (MVNOs) and allowing more players to import phones. The first MVNO to operate, on December 5, 2011, was [[Rami Levy Communications]]. The MVNOs offered monthly bundles that were priced much lower than the average monthly bills offered by the incumbent providers, which resulted in a significant fall in monthly bills and a significant fall in the incumbents’ Average Revenue per User (ARPU). For example, while Partner's monthly average ARPU in 2006-2008 was 161 shekels,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.partner.co.il/globalassets/global/investor-relations/pdfs/20-f-2010-final.pdf.

Partner Communications Company. Retrieved 2016-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Ministry of Finance paper, the reform resulted in 17.5 billion shekels (approximately 4.6 billion dollars) of total economy savings up to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.themarker.com/technation/1.2938246|title= הסכום המדהים שחסכה לנו רפורמת הסלולר - והאם המחירים יעלו בקרוב|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 2012 ''TheMarker'' conference Kahlon said {{he icon}}: “This is the place to admit that, along with ''TheMarker'', we led the opening of the cellular market to competition.

===The July 2011 social protests===

{{main|2011 Israeli social justice protests}}

On July 14, 2011, a small group of demonstrators set up tents on the north end of [[Tel Aviv]]’s [[Rothschild Boulevard]], protesting the high prices of rents. Shortly after that they were joined by hundreds, and later thousands, more protesters who occupied more streets in Tel Aviv and other cities. By then, their protest expanded to the high cost of living and low pay for many professionals. Their slogan was “the people demands social justice”. Its peak came in September 3, 2011, when about half a million protesters went to the streets in many cities across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/some-450-000-israelis-march-at-massive-march-of-the-million-rallies-across-country-1.382366|title=Some 450,000 Israelis March at Massive 'March of the Million' Rallies Across Country|newspaper=Haaretz|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, most Israeli media covered the protests extensively thereby amplifying them. But once it became clear that the protesters were demanding a new economic and social order, some major newspapers cut back on their coverage. In an August 28, 2016, article in [[HaAyin HaShevi'it]], an Israeli media watchdog, interviewed a former editor of a leading news outlet who said: “We watched with horror how the social protests were inflated and promoted out of proportion when they erupted and when the fire was directed at Prime Minister Netanyahu – and how, at its peak, as the protesters focused on the powerful businesspeople (and indirectly also to the mainstream press) it was dwarfed”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.the7eye.org.il/216419|title= האלפא מייל של הבבונים מהשמאל|newspaper= HaAyin HaShevi'it (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''TheMarker'', identifying the many similarities between the protesters’ agenda and its own views, supported them throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themarker.com/advertising/1.1519997|title=ערוץ 2: TheMarker הפך לעיתון המשפיע ביותר בישראל; תרם להנחת התשתית למחאה|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Nordic Model===

In late 2011, a few months after the wave of social protests, ''TheMarker'' published a series of articles on three Nordic states – Finland, Sweden and Denmark – and their brand of economic order, mostly known as [[Nordic model|The Nordic Model]], which is based on a combination of pro-market capitalism, welfare state policies and inclusive collective bargaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themarker.com/markerweek/markeryear/1.1596243|title=פינלנד: צדק חברתי, מדינת רווחה - כך עושים את זה בפינלנד|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themarker.com/markerweek/markeryear/1.1596248|title=שוודיה: כך צומחים במיתון - וגם דואגים לאיכות חיים מעוררת קנאה|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themarker.com/markerweek/markeryear/1.1596236|title=מדוע הדנים משלמים 22 שקל על אספרסו ועדיין מרגישים שעשו עסקה נהדרת?|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The articles portrayed the countries that are characterized by competition along with a deep regard of humanistic values, whose citizens seem happy with the way things are and enjoy a high standard of living.

The series was met with much enthusiasm with readers and its articles were some of the most-read in ''TheMarker''’s history. On February 2, 2013, ''[[The Economist]]'' issued a Special Report on the Nordic countries, “Northern Lights”, in which it wrote that “the Nordic countries are probably the best-governed in the world”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20130202_nordic_countries.pdf|title= Special Report: Northern Lights |newspaper=The Economist|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Create competition in the food industry===

Like others in Israel, the food industry is characterized by big players – both retailers and suppliers.

According to a [[Dun &amp; Bradstreet]] report, in 2014, the three top retail chains – [[Shufersal]], Mega Retail and [[Rami Levy Hashikma Marketing]] – held together 62% of the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://duns100.globes.co.il/article-1000972881|title=סקירת ענף המזון|newspaper=Globes (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Bitan Wines, whose 2014 share was 8%, bought Mega Retail, which made the market even more concentrated. According to the Dun and Bradstreet report, then top 4 food manufacturers – [[Tnuva]], The Central Bottling Co. (Coca-Cola Israel), [[Strauss (company)|Strauss]] and [[Osem (company)|Osem]] – held a combined market share of 62% of the top 13 food manufacturers.

On March 19, 2014, following ''TheMarker''’s campaign, which gained impetus following the July 2011 social protests, the Knesset approved, with no objections, a law for the promotion of competition in the food market.&lt;ref&gt;https://oknesset.org/vote/7154/. oknesset.org (Hebrew). Retrieved 2016-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The law aims to increase competition by limiting the market influence of major chains and suppliers and by affording smaller suppliers with bigger and more prominent shelf space.

===Banks and credit card companies===

The April 2004 committee forced banks to sell their money-management corporations. Later, the [[Israel's Anti-Concentration Law|Anti-Concentration Law]] imposed a strict ownership separation between financial and non-financial holdings; the removal of Danny Dankner from Bank Hapoalim and his subsequent conviction sent a clear message regarding corporate governance and criminal activities and liabilities; and the capping of bankers’ pay delineated what was accepted and what was rejected. But another aspect of the banking system was still left unchanged: the big banks’ control of the credit card business.

In September 1, 2016, also following a two-year campaign by ''TheMarker'' and with its backing, a committee created by Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon and the Bank of Israel's Governor [[Karnit Flug|Dr. Karnit Flug]], recommended that Israel's two biggest banks, Hapoalim and Leumi, sell their credit card companies and that new competitors be set up to compete against banks in the credit markets.&lt;ref&gt;http://mof.gov.il/Committees/CompetitivenessCommittee/SummarizingReport.pdf.

===Netanyahu’s Natural Gas Outline===

The Natural Gas Outline is the name given to Prime Minister Netanyahu's government's decision from August 16, 2015, in which it set rules for the exploitation of the country's gas files, which are privately owned.

The decision came after intense discussions within the government ministries. On May 25, 2015, the director of Israel's Antitrust Authority, who strongly opposed the apparent outline, resigned in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themarker.com/news/1.2643938|title="איני יכול עוד": התפטרות דרמטית של דיויד גילה, הממונה על ההגבלים - המכתב המלא|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in order to pass the outline, Netanyahu took the position of [[Ministry of Economy (Israel)|Minister of Economy]] so he could make the necessary decision that the previous minister refused to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themarker.com/dynamo/1.2800840|title=נתניהו חתם על המתווה: "הגז ניתן לנו על ידי הקב"ה. אני לא מושפע מפופוליזם"|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the discovery of the Tamar gas field in January 2009, a few other fields were discovered, the largest of which is [[Leviathan gas field|Leviathan]] (July 2010). These are Israel's two biggest gas fields. As of 2015, Leviathan was estimated at 21,934.5 billion cubic feet (BCF) (2C estimate of total reserves) and Tamar was estimated at 10,260.3 BCF (2P estimate of total reserves).&lt;ref&gt;http://maya.tase.co.il/reports/details/1026344/2/0.

Netanyahu's outline drew fierce criticism, especially by ''TheMarker'', regarding two major components of the outline: “the stability clause”, that promised the owners that the government would not initiate laws that would change the taxation of their profits for 10 years; and the price that the outline promised the owners, $5.4 per million [[British Thermal Unit]] (BTU).

''TheMarker'' argued that the stability clause unconstitutional as it prevented future governments from governing by creating laws. ''TheMarker'' also argued that the price was not competitive, pointing to the falling global prices of natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.themarker.com/dynamo/1.2843836|title=הממשלה מודה לראשונה: מחיר הגז מתמר גבוה מדי|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2015, the government agency in charge of the electricity market issues a report that stated the outline would be equal to a “7.3 million shekels fine” on the Israeli public (approx. 1.9 billion dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.themarker.com/dynamo/1.2706214|title= "הישראלים ייקנסו ב-7.3 מיליארד שקל" - הדו"ח הדרמטי שהוביל להדחתה של אורית פרקש|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following that report, Netanyahu fired the agency's director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.themarker.com/dynamo/1.2701111|title=נקמת הגז: נתניהו ושטייניץ הדיחו את יו"ר רשות החשמל, אורית פרקש-הכהן|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the outline and Netanyahu's handling of the controversies, a few demonstrations and rallies were held, the largest of which took place on November 14, 2015, in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themarker.com/news/LIVE-1.2776122|title=יותר מ-10,000 הפגינו נגד מתווה הגז. זליכה: "יזמים וראשי השלטון שודדים את המאגר הציבורי"|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2016, [[Supreme Court (Israel)|Israel's Supreme Court]] rejected the August 16, 2015, outline, criticizing the “stability clause”, saying that it “overstepped the boundaries of what can be done in a democracy” and allowed the government a year to amend the outline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themarker.com/dynamo/1.2895512|title=מתווה הגז בוטל: הפצצה של בג"ץ - "חציית הגבולות המותרים בדמוקרטיה"|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 22, 2016, the government issued a new outline which, according to Netanyahu, addressed the Supreme Court's concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themarker.com/news/1.2951187|title=תיקון מתווה הגז אושר; נתניהו: "צריך להודות לראש הממשלה"; השר גבאי התנגד|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later, On May 27, [[Avi Gabai]], who also opposed the outline, resigned from his position as the [[Ministry of Environmental Protection (Israel)|Minister of Environmental Protection]].

On November 23, 2016, a District court judge ruled that it will proceed with a class action against the owners of the Tamar gas field regarding the price they charge Israel Electric Corporation for gas, thus bringing the price issue back into court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themarker.com/dynamo/1.3131490|title=מכה למונופול ולמנדלבליט: מחיר הגז חוזר לבית המשפט|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political corruption===

Since its inception, ''TheMarker'' has been a fierce critic of both illegal and [[Corruption#Legal corruption|legal corruption]] and frequently wrote about the strongest Israeli politicians, both from the left and the right, among them former Israeli Prime Ministers [[Ariel Sharon]] and [[Ehud Olmert]], former Finance Minister [[Avraham Hirschson]], former Minister of Industry, Trade &amp; Labour [[Binyamin Ben-Eliezer]] and current Foreign Minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]].

Olmert and Hirschson were the first Israeli former Prime Minister and former Finance Minister, respectively, to be convicted of criminal charges and sentenced to prison. Ben-Eliezer was indicted in December 2015. He died in August 2016, while his trial was still underway.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Ariel Sharon was suspected of corruption twice. In 2001 it was alleged that Israeli businessman and political operator [[David Appel (businessman)|David Appel]] bribed Sharon by paying Sharon's son, Gilad Sharon, hundreds of thousands of dollars for a consulting Appel on a project Gilad Sharon was believed to have no real expertise in (the “[[Greek island affair]]”). In June 2004, the Attorney General ruled that there was no evidence to support the claims. In 2002, a State Comptroller report raised the suspicion that South African businessman and a longtime friend of Sharon Cyril Kern helped Sharon repay illegal contributions to a 1999 campaign by making a $1.5 million loan to Sharon's sons, [[Gilad Sharon]] and [[Omri Sharon]], the original source of the money being Austrian businessman [[Martin Schlaff]] (the “Cyril Kern affair”). The police recommended indicting Gilad Sharon and Omri Sharon, but in 2013 the case was dropped because of difficulties in interrogating Schlaff in Austria and because Ariel Sharon fell into a coma in early 2006 and could not be interrogated.

Schlaff is well connected to three other top Israeli politicians who were suspected of corruption, Lieberman, Olmert, and [[Aryeh Deri]], who was convicted and sentenced to prison in 2000 on an issue unrelated to Schlaff.

Lieberman was suspected of being paid millions of shekels in bribes by Russian-Israeli businessman [[Michael Cherney]] between 1999 and 2009. Also, approximately 7 million shekels, were paid from foreign accounts to a company founded by Lieberman's daughter in 2004, when she was 21. The company paid high salaries to both Lieberman and his daughter. In December 2012, years after it landed on his desk, the then Attorney General, [[Yehuda Weinstein]], decided to close the case because the time that passed had weakened the evidence.

===Israel Defense Forces (IDF)===

''TheMarker'' is also a constant critic of the finances of the Israeli military ([[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]).

For many decades, the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Israeli Defense Ministry]]’s budget has been the biggest of all the government’s ministries. Since the early 2000s, the share of expenses on defense stands at about 9% of Israeli GDP.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbs.gov.il/publications/hozaot_bitahon06/pdf/h_print.pdf. Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics (Hebrew). Retrieved 2016-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Israeli Defense Ministry’s actual budget was 62 billion shekels (approx. $16 billion).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.obudget.org/?srch-term=%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%91+%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%93+%D7%94%D7%91%D7%99%D7%98%D7%97%D7%95%D7%9F+2015#budget/15/2016/en. obudget.org (Hebrew). Retrieved 2016-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

As it is mostly secret and hidden from public scrutiny, ''TheMarker'' argues, the budget helps conceal – and even encourage – inefficiencies and corruption. One major issue ''TheMarker'' follows closely is personnel remuneration – wages and benefits, and especially pension schemes. ''TheMarker'' contends that the military should differentiate between combat-related wages and wages paid to personnel who occupy civilian-like positions, especially those who serve close to home; and that the army should stop providing its personnel with pensions that are wholly paid by the defense budget (“budgetary pensions”) and reveal the true existing commitments toward the existing budgetary pensions.

''TheMarker'' also argues that the finances of the defense budget are almost never part of the public discourse, as well as the effect the economic and geopolitical changes should have on the defense budget.

It is also the position of ''TheMarker'' that the defense budget creates a caste of former top officers that are paid considerable sums for consulting and brokerage fees and that the budget helps keep alive many defense-related industries that would otherwise be considered inefficient and discontinued.

==Awards==

Over the years, ''TheMarker'', separately and together with Rolnik, won several awards for journalistic as well as marketing achievements.

Four of the awards were related to the January 2005 launch of ''TheMarker'' as a daily paid for newspaper:
# Guy Rolnik won the Israel's Marketing Association's “Marketing person of the month” for July 2005. The judges wrote: “Rolnik is the person behind ''TheMarker''’s latest move – the launch of the daily newspaper under ''TheMarker''’s brand – a move that is a unique success. The launch of the new newspaper brought a dramatic change in the newspaper’s position in the economic arena, a renewal in subscriber additions in Haaretz, a decrease in churning and a strengthening of the loyalty of the readers to the newspaper”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.themarker.com/advertising/1.305205|title=איש השיווק של איגוד המפרסמים לחודש יולי: גיא רולניק, העורך הראשי של TheMarker|newspaper=TheMarker (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Later that year he also won the association's “Marketing person of the year” award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.1074623|title=אנשי השיווק של השנה: גיא רולניק וטמירה ירדני|newspaper=Haaretz (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# In 2006 ''TheMarker'' won the Israeli [[Effie Award|EFFIE Award]] in the media category for that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/themarker-wins-advertising-and-marketing-oscar-at-2007-effie-awards-1.225088|title= TheMarker Wins Advertising and Marketing 'Oscar' at 2007 Effie Awards |newspaper=Haaretz|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# In 2007 ''TheMarker'' won the EFFIE Platinum award for “Building the strongest economic brand in Israel”, which is awarded to multi-year marketing efforts and is considered the “Oscar” of marketing awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/themarker-wins-advertising-and-marketing-oscar-at-2007-effie-awards-1.225088|title= TheMarker Wins Advertising and Marketing 'Oscar' at 2007 Effie Awards |newspaper=Haaretz|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most notable personal awards Rolnik won for his journalistic achievements include:
# '''June 2005''': The [[Movement for Quality Government in Israel]]’s “Knight of Quality Government” award. The Movement said that it was awarded Rolnik “in gratitude for a unique contribution in the media for uncovering faults and in the public service, for a struggle against corruption and for the improvement of the quality of public sector. In his commentary, Rolnik raises the level of public criticism on the government's behavior and underscores its importance to the improvement of the quality of government. By doing so he sets an example of quality to his colleagues in the media and to Israeli society”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mqg.org.il/%D7%94%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94/%D7%90%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%98%D7%95%D7%9F/%D7%90%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%98%D7%95%D7%9F2005/tabid/109/Default.aspx. The Movement for Quality Government in Israel (Hebrew). Retrieved 2016-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''January 2008''': The "quality of economic journalism" prize by Israel's Society for the Public's Right to Know.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/gallery/1.1299012|title=פרסים מטעם האגודה לזכות הציבור לדעת ליבגניה קרבצ'יק, נחום שחף וגיא רולניק|newspaper=Haaretz (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its explanatory notes, the organization wrote that "Rolnik is one of the best business journalists and commentators in Israel today. In his clear and challenging writings, Rolnik demonstrates civilian courage of the first degree and does not refrain even from writing about, and even attacking, influential elements in the Israeli economy".
# '''December 2013''': The [[Sokolov Prize]] for “Lifetime Achievement” (The Israeli Pulitzer). In its decision to grant the prize to Rolnik, the jury wrote: “Guy Rolnik untiringly shed light on problems in the structure of the Israeli economy, the judges commented in granting him the award. Notably, Rolnik demonstrated the concentration of capital in the hands of a small number of financial organizations connected to the holders of political and governing power. He exposed grave flaws in the current structure and demanded they be corrected to ensure the existence of a more resilient, just and egalitarian economic system”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/1.566007|title=Guy Rolnik, Founder of TheMarker, Receives Prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award|newspaper=Haaretz|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Press mentions==

In May 2004, ''HaAyin HaShevi'it'' interviewed journalists, business people and media experts in Israel. Almost all of them expressed the view that Rolnik is Israel's most influential columnist and the best economic journalist in Israel. “Rolnik writes the most important economic column in Israel, he has no competition. As a member of boards and committees I hear very often people talking about what Rolnik wrote this morning. People read his daily column avidly and with fear. There is no other journalist in Israel that has such position in his field – he is the master of the domain… When he mentions a person or a phenomenon in his column – its value will go up”. A senior executive in the media industry was quoted: “Rolnik is the most influential economics journalist in Israel, I read every word he writes. Unlike other journalists he manages to surprise me time and again because his position is so unpredictable”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.the7eye.org.il/29810|title=מניה עולה|newspaper= HaAyin HaShevi'it (Hebrew)|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, ''[[The New Yorker]]'''s editor, [[David Remnick]], published a story about Haaretz and Schocken, saying "Under the leadership of a young, hyper-ambitious editor named Guy Rolnik, ''TheMarker'' brought a new, more youthful audience to Haaretz — one at least as interested in the high-tech industry as it is in the Palestinian issue — just as the worldwide newspaper crisis hit. ''TheMarker'', which can be bought separately, has helped save the paper. Rolnik has been especially good at publishing investigative pieces on what he calls the 'Israeli oligarchs,' a small group of billionaires and their families who control much of the national economy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/02/28/the-dissenters|title=The Dissenters|newspaper=The New Yorker|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, journalist and media critic [[Michael Massing]] highlighted the work done by ''TheMarker'' and Rolnik in an essay “How to fix American Journalism” that appeared in the special issue of ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine for its 150th anniversary. According to Massing, the unique campaign that waged Rolnik as editor-in-chief of ''TheMarker'' is the model for fixing American journalism:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.thenation.com/article/how-fix-american-journalism/|title= How To Fix American Journalism|newspaper=The Nation|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''TheMarker'', an Israeli financial newspaper distributed as a supplement to Haaretz, waged an unflagging campaign beginning in the mid-2000s against the extraordinary concentration of economic power in Israel and the dangers that this development posed to Israeli society and democracy. Led by its founding editor, Guy Rolnik, the paper ran periodic stories and columns that paid special attention to the “Israeli oligarchs,” a small group of billionaires and their families who controlled much of the Israeli economy. When the campaign began, the subject of economic concentration was barely discussed in Israel. The stories fed growing outrage over inequality, leading to a series of mass demonstrations in 2011. Those protests, in turn, spurred the Knesset to pass a bill to break up the Israeli conglomerates. It was a remarkable display of how one news organization, through tenacious and unflinching reporting over a period of years, can help spur systemic change ... Remarkably, of the many high-profile digital-journalism sites—the [[Huffington Post]], [[The Daily Beast]], [[BuzzFeed]], [[Business Insider]]—not one scrutinizes America's oligarchs the way ''TheMarker'' did Israel's. [[ProPublica]], the prime investigative site on the web, has done impressive reporting on a number of important subjects, including fracking and the secret Fed tapes, but in general it remains wedded to a traditional narrow-focus approach".

'''The Fellowship''' was the label given to a group of people within the [[Presbyterian Church of Australia]]. Located in [[Melbourne]], it was estimated to involve between 300 and 400 people.&lt;ref name="Fractured"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zwartz |first= Morag |title= Fractured Families: The Story of a Melbourne Church Cult |url= |accessdate= |publisher= Paranesis|location= Boronia |isbn= 0-9587955-1-7|pages= vi|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fellowship was labelled by opponents as a "secretive cult".
&lt;ref name="Breaking"&gt;{{cite news |first= Barney|last=Zwartz |title= Breaking the Fellowship: a bitter-sweet crusade|url= http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/breaking-the-fellowship-a-bittersweet-crusade/2006/03/03/1141191854028.html|work= The Age|publisher= Fairfax|date= 4 March 2006|accessdate=3 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Fellowship was started by Ronald Grant and Alan Neil, who had both served as missionaries with the [[South Seas Evangelical Mission]] in the [[Solomon Islands]]. While missionaries, both were profoundly influenced by widespread&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gideon Fangalea|url=http://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/mjt/26-1_05.pdf |title=SPIRITUALITY: THE SOUTH SEA EVANGELICAL CHURCH IN THE SOLOMON ISLANDS |journal=Melanesian Journal of Theology| pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; experiences of "the conviction of sin and deliverance from demons"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book | title=Fractured Fellowship: A Presbyterian Case Study | publisher=[[Presbyterian Church of Victoria]] | author=Stasse, John | year=1999 | location=Melbourne | pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; during their participation in a [[Christian revival|revival]] in the [[Solomon Islands]].&lt;ref name= "Fire In The Islands"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fire in the Islands |year=1977 |publisher= Harold Shaw |author= Alison Griffiths |isbn= 0-87788-264-9 |pages= 202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dissatisfied with perceived persecution from evangelical circles following their requested resignation due to "doctrinal differences"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; the pair started house meetings in their homes in the late 1930s. Communicants of these meetings would later be labelled as members of "The Fellowship".

Alan Neil died in the late 1960s, and Ronald Grant was involved in the group until his death in 1995. During the following year, members left their current churches and joined one of three Presbyterian churches: Clayton, Mount Evelyn and Camberwell, reportedly at the direction of the Fellowship.&lt;ref name="FracturedFellowship2"&gt;{{cite book | title=Fractured Fellowship: A Presbyterian Case Study | publisher=[[Presbyterian Church of Victoria]] | author=Stasse, John | year=1999 | location=Melbourne | pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, people accused of being in the Fellowship were removed from membership of the Mount Evelyn church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Barney Zwartz|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/breaking-the-fellowship-a-bittersweet-crusade/2006/03/03/1141191854028.html|title=Breaking the Fellowship: a bitter-sweet crusade|publisher=[[The Age]]|date=4 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The Fellowship was strongly opposed to [[Freemasonry]]. A theory of "generational curses" was taught, which encourages repentance if a member's ancestors were Freemasons.&lt;ref name="Breaking"/&gt;

The Fellowship emphasised the importance of what it calls "walking in the light",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.religionnewsblog.com/13751/the-fellowship-inside-out.|author= ABC Radio Interview Rachel Kohn, Morag Zwartz, Heather Mills&lt;/ref&gt; referencing 1 John 1:7. In the context of The Fellowship, "walking in the light" means the public confession of sin to one another and being completely transparent with others to keep one another accountable. The doctrine argues that God's forgiveness ''depends'' upon such public confession of sin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.religionnewsblog.com/22586/fellowship-bruce-teele-heresy|author= Summary of article by Barney Zwartz The Age 30 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuart Piggin suggests that they combined "[[Remnant (Bible)|remnant]]" and "[[Christian revival|revival]]" mentalities, and that occasional visitors to their meetings "have been impressed by the Christian calibre of those who attended and could not fault the Scriptural teaching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Piggin|first=Stuart|title=Spirit of a Nation: The Story of Australia's Christian Heritage|year=2004|publisher=Strand Publishing|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The Fellowship was criticised for broken relationships between Fellowship members and their families. Allegations were made that non-Fellowship people were unable to see their grandchildren, and that Fellowship people refused on occasion to attend funerals of non-Fellowship family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fractured Fellowship: A Presbyterian Case Study|editor= John Stasse |year= 1999|publisher= [[Presbyterian Church of Victoria]]|location= Melbourne|isbn= |pages= 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these relationships have been mending, with families being reunited and grandchildren forming very close relationships with their grandparents, even aunts and uncles who were once distant. ''Fractured Fellowship'' makes this case based on primary sources, including private letters, that have never been published.

==Actions by the Presbyterian Church==
In February 2006, the Presbytery of Melbourne East [[excommunicated]] all 15 elders of the Camberwell congregation because of their handling of a complaint of emotional abuse against an elder.&lt;ref name="Excommunication"&gt;{{cite news |title= Church excommunicates 15 for cult membership|url= http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/church-excommunicates-15-over-cult/2006/02/24/1140670265693.html|work= The Age|publisher= Fairfax|date= 25 February 2006|author=Barney Zwartz|quote= "The Presbyterian Church's Australian head, Moderator-General Bob Thomas, said yesterday the presbytery removed the elders because it considered they discharged their duties unsatisfactorily and not in accord with the code of behaviour expected of elders."|accessdate=3 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This decision was appealed to the [[Presbyterian Church of Victoria|State Assembly]], which upheld the decision of the Presbytery at its meeting in October 2006.&lt;ref name="Backinfold"&gt;{{cite news |author= Barney Zwartz |title= Cult elders back in church fold|url= http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/cult-elders-back-in-church-fold/2007/08/02/1185648061404.html|work= The Age|publisher= Fairfax|date=3 August 2007 |accessdate=3 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the Victorian Assembly then appealed the decision to the General Assembly of Australia on the grounds that the Victorian Church had set up its own processes for discipline rather than operating under the General Assembly's Code as required and that the decision of the Victorian Assembly was made based on information that was not available to the Presbytery of East Melbourne when making its original decision, against its own process of discipline.

These appeals were upheld by the General Assembly of Australia at its Commission in August 2007.&lt;ref name="Backinfold"/&gt; The clerk of the General Assembly, Dr Paul Logan, said that many felt that natural justice had been denied by the processes used.&lt;ref name="Backinfold"/&gt; As a result of this decision the elders were reinstated.&lt;ref name="Backinfold"/&gt;

The General Assembly of Australia established a committee to investigate material published about The Fellowship, including allegations of errors in doctrine and behaviour, promising to re-hear complaints.&lt;ref name="Backinfold"/&gt;

The Victorian State Assembly was instructed by the General Assembly of Australia to take several actions including withdrawing from publication ''Fractured Fellowship: A Presbyterian Case Study'' and temporarily moving the parish of Camberwell from the Presbytery of Melbourne East to the Presbytery of Melbourne West until the matter could be settled. At its Commission in May 2008 the Victorian Assembly handled the private report of the committee of the General Assembly in public session, rejecting its instructions to retry the matter. Rev. Douglas Robertson from [[Scots' Church, Melbourne|Scots' Church]] in Melbourne, who at the same meeting was elected the next Moderator of the Victorian Assembly, accused the General Assembly of Australia of censorship and unconstitutionally exceeding its authority.&lt;ref name="Splits"&gt;{{cite news |author= Barney Zwartz |title= Presbyterian church split over cults fate |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/presbyterian-church-split-over-cults-fate/2008/05/09/1210131265843.html |work= The Age|publisher= Fairfax|date= 10 May 2008|accessdate=3 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rights&amp;wrongs"&gt;{{cite news |author= Barney Zwartz |title= State Presbyterian Assembly rights the national wrongs|url= http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/state-presbyterian-assembly-rights-the-national-wrongs/2008/05/11/1210444242985.html|work= The Age|publisher= Fairfax|date= 12 May 2008|accessdate=3 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Travancore Royal Family''' was the ruling house of the Indian princely state of [[Travancore]].They lost their ruling rights in 1949 when Travancore merged with the [[Indian Union]] and their [[Privy Purse in India|privileges]] were abolished by the Indian Union in 1971 by a constitutional amendment. Travancore and Kolathiri families are said to be those surviving among the original royal [[Velirs|Velir]] Family's lineages, and are both descendants of the Ay/Venad Family, and related to the Cheras, Pandyas and Cholas. The last ruler in that bloodline was Maharaja Sree [[Moolam Thirunal]], as the family of Maharaja Chithira Thirunal and successors was adopted in 1900 against the laws of Travancore succession from the Utsava Madom of Mavelikkara. Historians, including Robin Jeffry, Faucett and Samuel Mateer, are of the opinion that as with all other Kings of Malabar (Kerala), the Cochin Raja (Perumpadapum Moopil) and Venadu Swarupam was also of Nair origin. Mateer states: "There seems reason to believe that the whole of the kings of Malabar also, notwithstanding the pretensions set up for them of late by their dependents, belong to the same great body, and are homogeneous with the mass of the people called Nairs.

The Royal family is alternatively known as the '''Kupaka Swaroopam''', '''Thripappur Swaroopam''', '''[[Venad]] Swaroopam''', '''Vanchi Swaroopam''' etc. It has its seat today at [[Thiruvananthapuram]] in Kerala, India. The last ruling [[Maharajah]] of Travancore was Sree [[Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma]], died on 20 July 1991 after a stroke. Sree [[Uthradom Thirunal Marthanda Varma]], the younger brother of the last ruling monarch of the [[Kingdom of Travancore]], [[Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma|Maharajah Chitra Thirunal Rama Varma]], died at a private hospital in the early hours on 16 December 2013. He was succeeded by Sree [[Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma]], son of Maharani [[Karthika Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi]] and Lt. Col. Goda Varma [[G. V. Raja]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/marthanda-varma-head-of-travancore-royal-family-dies/article5465077.ece?homepage=true | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Uthradom Tirunal passes away | date=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and legends of the dynasty==
[[File:Installation of Bhanu Vicrama as King of Kerala.png|thumb|Installation of Bhanu Vicrama as King of Kerala by Parashurama]]
The family descends from ancient Kings &lt;ref&gt;per Wigram, H., Malabar Law and Custom High Court of Judicature Madras 1900 See Introduction at page xvi. Wigram also comments that they might perhaps be "the oldest aristocracy in the world."&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded inscription of the Venad chiefdom that later became Travancore is in the copper-plate grants of land and privileges on Jewish &amp; [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christian]] tradesmen&lt;ref&gt;Logan, W., "The Malabar Manual", 1887 at page 265&lt;/ref&gt;. The grants were made by the rulers of Kerala, the Perumal Viceroys of South Indian Kingdoms of the East Coast who were deputed to rule Kerala and witnessed by Chiefs including the Chief of [[Venad]]. &lt;ref&gt;Gough, K., page Matrilineal Kinship, University of California Press, Berkeley and LA 1962 at page 303&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning, when aristocratic lineages rose to power&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Page 373, K. Gough, Matrilineal Kinship, University of California Press,Berkeley and LA, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;, as in the case of small group broken away from its earlier tharavad through conquest. &lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;.When they acquired office, these groups seem to have severed ties with their former lineages and clans and to have conferred on themselves,a higher ritual rank as independent castes.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; These myths are likely to have been created to add to the aura of the dynasty.

According to existing myths, the founding members of the Travancore royal family&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news|last=SANTHANAM|first=KAUSALYA|title=Royal vignettes: Travancore – Simplicity graces this House|url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2003/03/30/stories/2003033000700700.htm|accessdate=11 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=30 March 2003|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; are said to have come to Kerala, from the banks of the [[Narmada]] river. Another claim is that [[Parashurama]] himself crowned the first official ruler in the dynasty although there is no evidence of this person historically.There is a claim that their history can be traced back to 820 C.E, which is based on the claim of descent from the Later [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]] of the three [[southern India]]n ''Mandala'' Kingdoms namely ''Chera Mandalam'', ''[[Pandya]] Mandalam'' and ''[[Chola]] Mandalam''.According to another legend, a branch of the Chera family was sent to the extreme north of the [[Kerala]] region, where they settled and came to be known as the ''Mooshika'' Royal family, or the later [[Kolathiri]]s, while another branch was deputed to go south to grapple with the [[Pandya]]n invasions.
One of the two branches of the Chera dynasty shifted to Venad/Quilon where it merged with the Ay kingdom. Sangramadhira [[Ravivarman Kulaśēkhara]] (1266–1314) was the most famed ruler of this Chera Ay dynasty.Numerous places are named after this Chera-Ay dynasty. Ravi Varman invaded the territories of the [[Pandya]]s and [[Chola]]s and performed imperial coronations at [[Madurai]] and [[Kanchipuram]] and thus threw off the [[Pandya]]n hegemony in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Travancore State Manual Vol II by Velu Pillai pages 104–105&lt;/ref&gt; However his success was short lived and after him his successors could not hold on to these acquisitions of the [[Pandya]]s and [[Chola]]s. Sangramadhira [[Ravivarman Kulaśēkhara]] adopted two princesses from the related Kolathiri dynasty called Attingal and Kunnumel Ranis in 1305 C.E. The line of kings after Ravi Varman followed the [[Marumakkathayam]] law of matrilineal succession.&lt;ref&gt;Native Life in Travancore Vol I by Rev:Samuel Mateer, AD 1883, pages 388&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal family continued thus in the female line. Whenever there were no females to take forth the line, princesses were adopted from the [[Kolathiri]] family, the latest adoption being in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2000/11/25/stories/0425404q.htm |title=The Hindu : New member in Travancore family |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date=25 November 2000 |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Umayamma Rani]] who reigned towards the end of the 17th century was a prominent ruler. [[Marthanda Varma]], the "maker of modern Travancore" and [[Dharma Raja]] were powerful rulers who re-established the power of monarchy in the state and destroyed that of the nobles. By the early 19th century the kingdom became a [[princely state]] under the [[British India|British]].  The British government accorded the Maharajah of Travancore a high 19 gun salute outside Travancore, whereas locally and for all temple festivals, the highest salute of 21 guns were fired.[[Swathi Thirunal]] was one of the most popular rulers of the 19th century. He made contributions both in the field of administration as well as music. The reign of [[Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma]] brought about revolutionary reforms like the [[Temple Entry Proclamation]], '''Free and Compulsory education for all''' etc.  He was referred to as the ''Father of Travancore industrialization'' by [[A. Sreedhara Menon]]. [[V. P. Menon]] in his book stated that, under [[Chithira Thirunal]]'s reign, Travancore had become the second most prosperous [[Princely State]] in the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bureau|first1=ET|title=Marthanda Varma could have been Kerala's Henry Ford but for family compulsions : "Travancore was the second wealthiest princely state after Nizam's Hyderabad when it joined the Indian union.

==Merger of Attingal==
The women of [[Travancore Royal Family]] were popularly referred to as Attingal Queens. Attingal was also considered as the ancestral homes of Travancore royals. Historians like V. Nagam Ayya, A. Sreedhara Menon etc. say that Attingal was never a separate Kingdom but the estates and provinces given to the royal women by the male head of the family(King). AS the Kings of Travancore were the sons of Attingal Queens, the latter were held in high respect by the royal family as well as the public. This respect and high status led to the wrong notion that Attingal Queens were once sovereigns which was further compounded by the writings of many foreign historians and travellers. Even if they had any power, it was taken away by Maharajah Sree Anizham Thirunal Veerabaala Marthanda Varma. Many Attingal Queens misused their status and signed potentially dangerous treaties with foreign forces, without even consulting with the reigning Travancore Kings. Maharajah Sree [[Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma]], anticipating the threat to the Kingdom's security, removed the powers of the Attingal Queens permanently and brought them under the complete control of the King. Thus, the Attingal Queens lost all private rights in the family properties, their power limited to the role of just a supervisor of such properties.&lt;ref&gt;''Kerala District Gazetteers Trivandrum''  by A. Sreedhara Menon, pages 190 to 192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Supreme Court"&gt;{{cite journal|author=N Ojha |title=Revathinnal Balagopala Varma vs His Highness Shri Padmanabhadasa ... on 28 November, 1991|journal=Supreme Court of India|date=28 November 1991|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1999764/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerala historian, Prof. [[A. Sreedhara Menon]] wrote : "Early in his reign Marthanda Varma assumed direct control over the so-called Attingal 'Queendom'. This was not an annexation or conquest, but "the amalgamation of Travancore with Attingal". The theory that the Ranis of Attingal exercised sovereign powers is incorrect. The fact is that in political matters, the Ranis exercised no sovereign rights. Any grant of rights over immovable property by the Ranis required the King's previous assent or subsequent confirmation for its validity. The so-called Queendom of Attingal had its origin in the 5th century when two Princesses were adopted into the Venad family and the revenues from certain estates in and around Attingal were assigned to them. Since then, the female members of the ruling family of Travancore had come to be known as Attingal Ranis. It was only the male children of these Tamburatties who could inherit the throne. When Marthanda Varma decided to assume direct control over the estates of Attingal, he was not interfering in the affairs of a sovereign State. As the head of the royal family and the ruler of the State, he had every right to interfere in the affairs of a part of his kingdom. The Rani had neither territory nor subjects. What she possessed was nothing more than the control over the revenues of the estates, powers she exercised were delegated to her by the sovereign of the State."&lt;ref name="Supreme Court"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kerala District Gazetteers Trivandrum'' by A. Sreedhara Menon, pages 190 to 192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thrippadidaanam and Sree Padmanabhadasa==
[[File:TVM aps temple.jpg|thumb|[[Padmanabhaswamy Temple]] dedicated to the patron deity of the family]]
[[File:Marthanda Vurmah Maha Rajah Making Over The Kingdom To Padmanabha Swamy.png|thumb|left|Maharaja Marthanda Varma making over the Kingdom To Padmanabha Swamy]]
Maharajah Sree Anizham Thirunal dedicated the Kingdom of Travancore to his family deity Sri Padmanabhaswamy in 1750 January 3 and after that he was referred to as Sree Padmanabhadasa Vanchipaala Maharajah Sree Anizham Thirunal Veerabaala Marthanda Varma Kulasekharaperumal. The Kings of Travancore, taking the title of "Sree Padmanabhadasa", ruled the kingdom as the servant of that deity. This important donation of the Kingdom to the Temple was known as "Thripadidaanam".&lt;ref&gt;Travancore State Manual Vol II by Velu Pillai page 348&lt;/ref&gt; Travancore as a whole, thus became the property of Sri Padmanabhaswamy, the deity of the Travancore Royal family or in other words ''"God's Own Country"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gauri Lakshmi Bayi|first=Aswathi Thirunal|title=Sreepadmanabhaswami Kshetram|year=1998|publisher=The State Institute of Languages|location=Thiruvananthapuram|isbn=978-81-7638-028-7|pages=168–172.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is erroneously believed that use of the title "Sree Padmanabhadasa" before royal male members' names came into being after Thrippadidaanam, but this title was in use even in the 16th century. During the first birthday ceremony of Maharajah Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma(Dharmaraja) in 1725, he is referred to as "Sree Padmanabhadasa" which was much before the Thrippadidaanam(1750) by Maharajah Anizham Thirunal Veerabaala [[Marthanda Varma]]. The title of "Sree Padmanabhadasa" is prefixed to the name of every Travancore King while the royal women are "Sree Padmanabhasevinis". In order to get the eligibility for attaining the title of "Sree Padmanabhadasa", certain rituals must be completed at the birth of new royal male members. On the first birthday of every royal male members would be put on the 'Ottakkalmandapam' of the Sree Padmanabhaswami Temple and holy water from the temple will be sprinkled on the baby and only after completion of this ceremony, the royal child is proclaimed as "Sree Padmanabhadasa". The female members also have a ritual called "Padiyettam" which is conducted only after their "Pallikettu" (wedding of Travancore Princesses and Queens). Only those male and female members who complete these ceremonies are allowed in the temple affairs and are also provided respect as well as the titles associated with temple as well as the royal family.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aswathy Thirunal|first=Gauri Lakshmi Bai|title=Sree Padmanabhaswamy Kshetram|year=1998|publisher=The State Institute of Languages, Kerala|location=Thiruvananthapuram|isbn=978-81-7638-028-7|pages=168–170, 179–180, 595–602}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Travancore State Manual Vol II by Velu Pillai&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption==
[[File:Rani Bharani Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi of Travancore (1848–1901).jpg|thumb|left|Maharani [[Bharani Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi]] was adopted from the related Kolathiri royal family]] The females of the royal family are styled as the "Queens of Attingal" with the titles of ''Attingal Mootha Thampurati'' (Senior Queen of Attingal) and ''Attingal Elaya Thampurati'' (Junior Queen of Attingal) and ''Attingal Kochu Thampurati'' (First Princess of Attingal).&lt;ref&gt;Travancore State Manal Vol II by Velu Pillai page 121&lt;/ref&gt; The first adoption to the Travancore Royal Family was in the early 14th century from the [[Kolathiri]] family because the Kolathiris are considered a sister dynasty by the Travancore Royalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/2594/10/10_chapter1.pdf] {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This adoption resulted in the branching of the Royal family into four families namely the branch at [[Trivandrum]], another at [[Kottarakara]] known as ''Elayadathu'' Swaroopam, the ''Peraka Thavazhi'' branch of [[Nedumangad]] and the [[Quilon]] branch. The later two branches died out into the 18th century whereas the last Rani of [[Kottarakara]] fled after battle with Maharajah [[Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma]].&lt;ref&gt;Travancore State Manual Vol II by Velu Pillai page 301&lt;/ref&gt; In 1630 two males were adopted from the [[Cochin Royal Family]]&lt;ref&gt;Travancore State Manual Vol II by Velu Pillai page 202&lt;/ref&gt; sowing the seed of dissension between the branches of the Royal family. Later in 1684 one male and two females were adopted from the [[Kolathiri]] family, from which family all subsequent adoptions were made, by [[Umayamma Rani]].&lt;ref&gt;Travancore State Manual Vol II by Velu Pillai page 228&lt;/ref&gt; In 1688 two males, including [[Rajah Rama Varma]], and 2 females were adopted and the famous Travancore King Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]] was born to one of these princesses.&lt;ref&gt;Travancore State Manual Vol II by Velu Pillai page 232&lt;/ref&gt; In 1718 a princess was adopted, whose son was the later King Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma [[Dharma Raja]]. In 1748 again four princesses were adopted and [[Balarama Varma]] (1798–1810) belonged to this line.&lt;ref&gt;Travancore State Manual Vol II by Velu Pillai page 347&lt;/ref&gt; The next adoption of 1788 brought forth the famous [[Maharani]]s, [[Gowri Lakshmi Bayi]] and [[Gowri Parvati Bayi]] and all the male rulers up to 1924, the last ruler in this line being Maharajah [[Moolam Thirunal]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Travancore State Manual Vol II by Velu Pillai page 399&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1857 two princesses, including [[Rani Lakshmi Bayi of Travancore|Rani Lakshmi Bayi]], were adopted from a branch of the [[Kolathiri]] family residing at [[Mavelikara]] since the 1790s, but by 1901 both these princesses and all their issue died.&lt;ref&gt;Travancore State Manual Vol II by Velu Pillai page 582&lt;/ref&gt; These adoptions were  against the Travancore laws of succession &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;See Manu Pillai Chapter 2 in The Ivory Throne, Harper Collins,India 2016. &lt;/ref&gt;   Harper Collins,India 2016. &lt;/ref&gt;  In 1900 again two princesses were again adopted from Mavelikara, granddaughters of [[Raja Ravi Varma]], [[Sethu Lakshmi Bayi]] and [[Sethu Parvathi Bayi]] (gave birth to the last ruling monarch of Travancore, Sree [[Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma]]).&lt;ref&gt;Travancore State Manual Vol II by Velu Pillai page 706&lt;/ref&gt; The latest adoption occurred in 1994 by Princess [[Aswathi Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi]] who adopted a princess named Lekha Parvathi Bayi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[India Today]]|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/lekha-varma-adopted-by-travancore-royal-family-becomes-heiress-to-its-millions/1/294655.html|title=Heir unapparent – Lekha Varma, adopted by Travancore royal family, becomes heiress to its millions|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Princess Lekha was disqualified by Hon. Supreme Court of India because of the lapses in adoption laws of the Constitution of India.

==Titles and precedence==
All members of the ruling family receive two names, an official personal name and a name associated with the 'star' or 'Thirunal' under which they are born,(e.g.: Maharajah Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma).

* The Heir Apparent is known as the ''Maharajkumar (personal name) Varma, Eliya Raja of Travancore.''
* The senior most female of the Royal family is the ''Attingal Mootha Thampuran'' and is known as ''Sree Padmanabhasevini Vanchidharma Vardhini Raja Rajeshwari Maharani (personal name) Bai, Senior Maharani of Travancore, with the style of Her Highness.''. The Junior Maharani is the ''Attingal Elaya Thampuran'' and if mother of the ruling prince is known as ''Sree Padmanabhasevini Vanchipala Dyumani Raja Rajeshwari Maharani Maharani (personal name) Bai, Junior Maharani of Travancore, with the style of Her Highness.'' The First Princess is known as ''Kochu Thampuran'' and is known as  ''(personal name) Sree Padmanabhasevini Vanchidharma Vardhini Attingal Kochu Thampuran''.
* Prince Consorts of the Senior and Junior Maharani are known as the ''Valiya Koyi Thampuran'' and ''Kochu Koyi Thampuran'' respectively, selected from one of four or five royal houses (or 'palaces') who were closely related to the ruling family . [[Kerala Varma Valiya Koil Thampuran]], consort of Maharani Bharani Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi, and Col. [[G. V. Raja]], consort of Maharani [[Karthika Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi]], went on to become famous in their own terms.

* Consorts of the Maharajahs are usually Nair women, and from Ammavedu, and hence, are ranked as nobility, and not royalty. They are known as [[Ammachi Panapillai Amma]] and hold the title of '' (mother's house name) Ammachi Panapilla Amma Srimathi (personal name) Pilla.''. The Maharajahs are only allowed [[morganatic]] marriages so as to maintain [[Marumakkathayam]]. The Travancore Maharajahs' children do not succeed to the throne under the [[Marumakkathayam]] Law, as they belong to their Nair mother's family and are not royalty. Instead they get a title of nobility, namely ''[[Thampi]] and Kochamma''. The sons of the ruling Kings are known as ''Sri (mother's house name) (personal name) Chempakaraman Thampi''. The daughters of the Kings are known as ''(mother's house name) Ammaveetil Srimathi (personal name) Pilla Kochamma.'' The descendants of Ammachis get the title of Thankachi (female) &amp; Thampi (male).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dr. Ivy Peter|first=Dr. D.

===Succession===
The Travancore Royal Family follows the Matrilineal inheritance.

Sreedhara Menon : "The Marumakkathayam system was followed till recently by several Hindu communities like the Kshatriyus, Ambalavasis and Nairs. It should be noted that succession in the Travancore and Cochin royal families took place in the female line, the eldest male member ascending the throne."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sreedhara Menon|first=A.|title=Cultural Heritage of Kerala|date=1978|publisher=DCBooks|location=Kottayam, Kerala|pages=233–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The surviving younger brothers of the Maharajah, according to age, and by the same mother.
* The sons of the sisters of the Maharajah, according to age. If there were more than one sister, the first born male child of that generation would be the heir, regardless of whether his mother was older or younger than other sisters. 
* The sons of the eldest maternal aunt of the Maharajah, according to age.
* The sons of the daughters of the eldest maternal aunt of the Maharajah, according to age. The sons of elder daughters succeeded before those of the younger sisters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TRAVANCORE|url=http://www.royalark.net/India/trava.htm|publisher=Christopher Buyers|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and other customs==
The marriages of the princesses are known as ''Pallikettu''s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayyam.com/hub/viewtopic.php?p=1412646 |title=Maharani Passed Away |publisher=Mayyam.com |date=8 June 2008 |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; while those of the [[Maharajahs]] are known as ''Pattum Parivattavum Chaarthal''. The form of marriage is [[Sambandham]] and the consorts of the Princesses are from certain select families of ''Koyi Thampurans'' came from one of four or five royal houses or 'palaces' who were closely related to the royal family whereas the consorts of the Maharajahs belong to four houses known as [[Ammaveedu]]s.

The kings of Thiruvithamkoor had been conditionally promoted to Kshatryahood with periodic performance of 16 mahādānams (great gifts in charity) such as Hiranya-garbhā, Hiranya-Kāmdhenu,and Hiranyāswaratā in which each of which thousands of [[Brahmins]] had been given costly gifts apart from each getting a minimum of 1 kazhanch (78.65&amp;nbsp;gm) of gold.&lt;ref name = "ASo00"&gt;''A Social History of India'' – (Ashish Publishing House: {{ISBN|81-7648-170-X}} / {{ISBN|81-7648-170-X}}, Jan 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1848 the [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Marquess of Dalhousie]], then [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General of British India]], was appraised that the depressed condition of the finances in Thiruvithamkoor was due to the mahādanams by the rulers.&lt;ref name = "Adm88"&gt;Sadasivan, S.N., 1988, ''Administration and social development in Kerala: A study in administrative sociology'', New Delhi, Indian Institute of Public Administration&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Dalhousie, instructed [[George Harris, 3rd Baron Harris|Lord Harris]], Governor of the [[Madras Presidency]], warn the then King of Thiruvithamkoor Martanda Varma (Uttram Tirunal 1847–60) that if he did not put a stop to this practice, the Madras Presidency would take over his Kingdom's administration. This led to the cessation of the practice of mahādanams. All Travancore Kings including [[Sree Moolam Thirunal]] conducted ''Hiranyagarbham'' and ''Tulapurushadaanam'' ceremony. Maharajah [[Chithira Thirunal]] is the only King of Travancore not to have conducted ''Hiranyagarbham'' or ''Tulaapurushadaanam'' as he considered these as an extremely costly ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mathrubhumi.com/paramparyam/story.php?id=230343 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224230755/http://www.mathrubhumi.com/paramparyam/story.php?id=230343 |archivedate=24 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Lakshmi Bayi married a wellknown journalist and writer, Prof. M.D. Nalapatt (son of famous writer [[Kamala Das]]). As Princess Thiruvathira Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi's marriage was not as per the tradition, Lekha varma of Mavelikkara Palace was adopted by Princess Aswathi Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi in 1996 into the royal family to continue in the female line and became Bharani Thirunal Lekha Parvathi Bayi, but against the 'pathivu shasanam' of Anizhom Thirunal Marthanda Varma.

Maharani Pooradam Thirunal [[Sethu Lakshmi Bayi]] had two daughters, Princesses Uthram Thirunal Lalithamba Bayi and Karthika Thirunal Indira Bayi. Revathi Thirunal Balagopal Varma, the grandson of Maharani Pooradam Thirunal, is the titular Elayarajah of Travancore.

The Constitutional Amendment of 1971 terminated the status of the Maharajahs of the erstwhile [[princely states]] as rulers and abolished their rights to receive privy purses. However the other clauses of the agreements signed between the Government of India and the Princes in 1947 legally still hold. The Royal Family of Travancore has no administrative authority since 1971. Till 1956 [[Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma]] served as ''Rajpramukh'' of [[Thiru-Kochi]]. Later in 1971 while the family lost their privy purse and other privileges, the rights of the family in the [[Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple]] were respected and the current head of the family, Sree Padmanabhadasa Sree [[Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma]], fulfills his duty towards the temple as the Titular Maharajah of Travancore and as the Trustee of [[Sree Padmanabhaswami Temple]], Trivandrum, even though he has no part in the administration of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mag/2003/03/30/stories/2003033000700700.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916193910/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mag/2003/03/30/stories/2003033000700700.htm |date=16 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The allowances of all the family members born prior to 1949 are also still paid by the Government of Kerala.

Some prominent members of the Travancore royal family today include Princess Bharani Thirunal ([[Rukmini Varma]]), Princess [[Aswathy Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi]], Prince Punartham Thirunal [[Shreekumar Varma]], Princess Makam Thirunal (Dr Lakshmi Raghunandan) and musician Prince [[Aswathi Thirunal Rama Varma]] (disciple of Vechoor Harihara Subramania Iyer and Dr. Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna).

==Palaces==
[[File:Padmanathapuram Palace-entry.jpg|thumb|Padmanabhapuram Palace]]
[[File:Palace of Trivandrum.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Kowdiar Palace]], The official residence of the descendants of Sethu Parvathi Bayi]]
The [[Padmanabhapuram Palace]] was the main residence of the Travancore Maharajahs whereas the Ranis of Attingal resided at that place in their own palaces. Later the royal family moved to [[Trivandrum]] wherein the females resided at the Sree Padam Palace and the men in many other Palaces like Thulsi Hill Palace, Rangavilaasom Palace, Kuthiramalika Palace etc.

The branch of [[Sethu Lakshmi Bayi]] had sold all their properties in Kerala in the late 1940s and early 1950s itself and moved outside the State. Most of them are settled at places like [[Chennai]], [[Bangalore]], also in foreign countries like United States of America, Australia, South Africa etc. They don't take part in any royal rituals or temple ceremonies, and is not in touch with Sethu Parvathi Bayi's family in Trivandrum.&lt;ref&gt;Raghunanadan, Lakshmi (1995). At the turn of the tide : the life and times of Maharani Setu Lakshmi Bayi.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Constitutional Amendment of 1971, the properties and estates of the Royal Family were partitioned and divided into two equal halves among the branches of Maharani [[Sethu Lakshmi Bayi]] and Maharani [[Sethu Parvathi Bayi]]. However certain legal disputes continued between Balagopala Varma (the grandson of Sethu Lakshmi Bayi) and Maharajah Sree Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma, regarding the ownership of the Stalemond Palace in Poojapura. According to the verdict given by the [[Supreme Court of India]] in the matter, the terms of division of properties was accepted by all members of both branches of the royal family. But later Balagopal Varma(Revathi Nal), who at the time of property division was a minor, accused that Sree Chithira Thirunal had unlawfully taken away a property, Poojappura Stalemond Palace, that rightly belonged to his grandmother, [[Sethu Lakshmi Bayi]] . Sree Chithira Thirunal had given away this Palace to the Government of Kerala to construct a new Medical Centre, the now famous, [[Sree Chitra Thirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology]], in 1974. Balagopala Varma(Revathi Nal) also accused that Sree Chithira Thirunal had unlawfully taken away the traditional holdings of Sethu Lakshmi Bayi, as Senior Rani of Attingal. The court also dismissed this argument while giving the final verdict in 1991.  Sethu Lakshmi Bayi's case was presented to the then Viceroy of India in the 30s but was dismissed by him, as former [[Maharajah of Travancore]], [[Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma]] had already removed all the powers of Attingal Queens in 18th century itself. Revathi Nal Balagopala Varma took his grievance first to the [[High Court of Kerala]] and later to the [[Supreme Court of India]]. However, at both courts, the verdicts came in favour of Sree Chithira Thirunal and the appelant, Revathi Nal's, case was dismissed in the final judgement of 1991 by the Supreme Court of India.&lt;ref name="indiankanoon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Revathinnal Balagopala Varma vs His Highness Shri Padmanabhadasa ... on 28 November, 1991|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1999764/|work=Supreme Court of India, Bench: S Ranganathan, M F Beevi, N Ojha|publisher=JUDGMENT N.D.

Presently only the descendants of [[Sethu Parvathi Bayi]] live at [[Kowdiar Palace]] as it belongs to her legal heirs and their descendants.

His two best known books are: ''The Pentecostals'' (1972)  and ''Pentecostalism: Origins and Developments Worldwide'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;* Hollenweger, W.J., The Pentecostals (Minneapolis: Augsburg Publishing House, 1972) 
* Hollenweger, W. J., Pentecostalism: Origins and Developments Worldwide, (Hendrickson Publications, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

His numerous publications in the years following made him one of the premier interpreters of this movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glopent.net/pentecostudies/2005 European Research Network on Global Pentecostalism, ‘‘Bibliography Walter J.

'''Mary "Zed" Martin''' is a fictional character in the ''[[Hellblazer]]'' series published by [[DC Comics]]' [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]. A psychic artist who met John Constantine in a London alleyway, she was recruited by an extremist Christian group called 'The Resurrection Crusade' to bear the Second Coming, which Constantine stopped from happening. She first appeared in ''Hellblazer'' #4.

==Fictional character biography==
Zed met the British mage John Constantine in a London alleyway, and was instantly attracted to him. She brought John back to her apartment to show him her artwork. One of the sketches adorning Zed's wall was that of Constantine himself, even though she had only just met him. Moments after familiarizing herself with John, she assisted him in rescuing his ten-year-old niece Gemma Masters from a psychotic member of the Damnation Army.

Shortly thereafter, the demon Nergal sent his grotesque agent Ironfist the Avenger to Zed's apartment on a mission to kill Constantine. Fortunately, John's quick wit convinced the creature to destroy itself while Zed and he fled to safety. He brought her to the home of his friend Ray Monde where Zed spent the night. The following morning, Zed's father Elder Martin, the apparent leader of the Resurrection Crusade barged into Monde's home and abducted her. Bringing her back to the Crusaders headquarters, they prepared her for a spiritual ritual. The ritual required a virgin, but unfortunately for the Crusaders, Zed's evening with John Constantine robbed her of her "purity". She then helps stop the Fear Machine, and later assists John in finding out about his twin.

Zed later reappeared as a pagan sorceress living on the coast of Scotland, where she helps another pagan group who has recently been harassed out of England by a cabal of secret police. In this incarnation, Zed has embraced a sort of feminist, goddess worshipping spiritual inclination which plays a crucial role in Constantine's efforts to thwart another conspiracy, this time by a group of Masonic demon-worshippers who have infitrated the upper echelons of the British government.

She gets visions from objects and people that she touches, and would often record these visions by sketching them. Constantine describes her as a "bitser", or someone with "bitser everything" in her, which in her case includes powers of precognition, retrocognition, and clairtangence. Her innate abilities bring on some powerful emotional connections and often put her at odds with Constantine, who is portrayed as an aloof loner who avoids all emotional connections.
