The '''Balkans Campaign''', or '''Balkan Theatre''' of [[World War I]] was fought between the [[Central Powers]], represented by [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[German Empire|Germany]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] on one side and the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], represented by [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] (and later [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], who sided with the Allied Powers) on the other side.

==Overview==
The prime cause of World War I was the hostility between Serbia and Austria-Hungary. Consequently, some of the earliest fighting took place between Serbia and Austria-Hungary. Serbia held out against Austria-Hungary for more than a year before it was conquered in late 1915.

[[Dalmatia]] was a strategic region during World War I that both Italy and Serbia intended to seize from Austria-Hungary. Italy entered the war in 1915 upon agreeing to the [[Treaty of London, 1915|Treaty of London]] that guaranteed Italy a substantial portion of Dalmatia.

Allied diplomacy was able to bring Romania into the war in 1916 but this proved disastrous for the Romanians. Shortly after they joined the war, a combined German, Austrian and Bulgarian offensive conquered two-thirds of their country in a rapid campaign which ended in December 1916. However, the Romanian and Russian armies managed to stabilize the front and hold on to [[Moldavia]].

In 1917, Greece entered the war on the Allied side, and in 1918, the multi-national [[Allied Army of the Orient]], based in northern [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], finally launched an offensive which drove Bulgaria to seek peace, recaptured Serbia and finally halted only at the border of [[Hungary]] in November 1918.

==Serbian-Montenegrin Campaign==
{{Main|Serbian Campaign of World War I}}

The Serbian Army was successfully able to rebuff the larger [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] due to Russia's assisting invasion from the north. In 1915 the Austro-Hungarian Empire placed additional soldiers in the south front while succeeding to engage Bulgaria as an ally.

Shortly after the Serbian forces were attacked from both the north and east, forcing a retreat to Greece. Despite the loss, the retreat was successful and the Serbian Army remained operational in Greece with a newly established base.

==Romanian Campaign==
{{Main|Romania during World War I}}

[[Romania]] before the war was an ally of Austria-Hungary but, like [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]], refused to join the war when it started. The Romanian government finally chose to side with the Allies in August 1916, the main reason for this was that they wanted the  annexation of [[Transylvania]], to the Kingdom of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwi/articles/romaniaduringwwi.aspx|title=Romania and its allies during World War I|last=Adochitei|first=Liliana|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war started with an advance of Romanian troops in Transylvania. The Central Powers' counteroffensive pushed back the Romanian Army to the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] line. After bloody battles along the [[Southern Carpathians]] line, German [[9th Army (German Empire)|9th Army]] made a breakthrough in the [[Jiu Valley]], passing the Carpathians. From this point the Romanians started a long retreat through succesive defending lines. Before the year was out, the Germans, Hungarians, Austrians, Bulgarians and Ottomans had conquered [[Wallachia]]. Russian and Romanian forces together with a Serbian military unit had to cede step by step [[Dobruja]].

In 1917, re-trained (mainly by a [[French military mission to Romania (1916-1918)|French military mission]] under the command of General [[Henri Berthelot]]) and re-supplied, the Romanian Army, together with a disintegrating [[Russian Empire|Russian]] Army, were successful in containing the German-Austro-Hungarian advance into [[Western Moldavia|Moldavia]] at [[Battle of Mărăşti|Mărăşti]], [[Battle of Mărăşeşti|Mărăşeşti]] and [[Second Battle of Oituz|Oituz]].

In May 1918, Russia signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] and after the German advance in the [[Ukraine]] Romania, surrounded by the Central Powers forces, had no other choice but to sue for peace (see [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)]]).

After the [[Vardar Offensive]] on the [[Macedonian Front]] knocked Bulgaria out of the war, Romania re-entered the war on November 10, 1918.

==Albanian Campaign==

Prior to direct intervention in World War I, [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] occupied the port of [[Vlorë]] in Albania in December 1914.&lt;ref name="Nigel Thomas 2001. Pp. 17"&gt;Nigel Thomas. Armies in the Balkans 1914-18. Osprey Publishing, 2001. Pp. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering the war, Italy spread its occupation to region of southern [[Albania (toponym)|Albania]] beginning in the autumn 1916.&lt;ref name="Nigel Thomas 2001. Pp. 17"/&gt; Italian forces in 1916 recruited Albanian irregulars to serve alongside them.&lt;ref name="Nigel Thomas 2001. Pp. 17"/&gt; Italy with permission of the Allied command, occupied [[Northern Epirus]] on 23 August 1916, forcing the neutralist Greek Army to withdraw its occupation forces from there.&lt;ref name="Nigel Thomas 2001. Pp. 17"/&gt;

In June 1917, Italy proclaimed central and southern Albania as a protectorate of Italy while Northern Albania was allocated to the states of Serbia and Montenegro.&lt;ref name="Nigel Thomas 2001. Pp. 17"/&gt; By 31 October 1918, French and Italian forces expelled the Austro-Hungarian Army from Albania.&lt;ref name="Nigel Thomas 2001. Pp. 17"/&gt;

[[Dalmatia]] was a strategic region during [[World War I]] that both Italy and Serbia intended to seize from Austria-Hungary. Italy joined the [[Triple Entente]] [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in 1915 upon agreeing to the [[London Pact]] that guaranteed Italy the right to annex a large portion of Dalmatia in exchange for Italy's participation on the Allied side. From 5–6 November 1918, Italian forces were reported to have reached [[Vis (island)|Lissa]], [[Lastovo|Lagosta]], [[Šibenik|Sebenico]], and other localities on the Dalmatian coast.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Praga, Franco Luxardo. ''History of Dalmatia''. Giardini, 1993. Pp. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of hostilities in November 1918, the Italian military had seized control of the entire portion of Dalmatia that had been guaranteed to Italy by the London Pact and by 17 November had seized Fiume as well.&lt;ref name="Paul O 2005.

==Bulgarian Campaign==
{{Main|Bulgaria during World War I}}

[[File:Bulgaria during World War I.png|thumb|450px|Bulgaria during World War I.]]

In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars Bulgarian opinion turned against Russia and the western powers, whom the Bulgarians felt had done nothing to help them. The government aligned Bulgaria with Germany and Austria-Hungary, even though this meant also becoming an ally of the Ottomans, Bulgaria's traditional enemy. But Bulgaria now had no claims against the Ottomans, whereas Serbia, Greece and Romania (allies of Britain and France) were all in possession of lands heavily populated by Bulgarians and thus perceived as Bulgarian.

Bulgaria, recuperating from the [[Balkan Wars]], sat out the first year of World War I. When Germany promised to restore the boundaries of the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Bulgaria, which had the largest army in the Balkans, declared war on Serbia in October 1915. Britain, France and Italy then declared war on Bulgaria.

Although Bulgaria, in alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, won military victories against Serbia and Romania, occupying much of Southern Serbia (taking [[Niš|Nish]], Serbia's war capital in November 5), advancing into [[Greek Macedonia]], and taking Dobruja from the Romanians in September 1916, the war soon became unpopular with the majority of Bulgarian people, who suffered enormous economic hardship. The [[February Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution of February 1917]] had a significant effect in Bulgaria, spreading antiwar and anti-monarchist sentiment among the troops and in the cities.

In September 1918 the Serbs, British, French, Italians and Greeks broke through on the [[Macedonian front]] in the [[Vardar Offensive]]. While Bulgarian forces [[Battle of Doiran (1918)|stopped them]] in [[Dojran]] and they didn't proceed to occupy Bulgarian lands, Tsar Ferdinand was forced to sue for peace.

In order to head off the revolutionaries, [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Ferdinand]] abdicated in favour of his son [[Boris III]]. The revolutionaries were suppressed and the army disbanded. Under the [[Treaty of Neuilly]] (November 1919), Bulgaria lost its Aegean coastline in favour of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers (transferred later by them to Greece) and nearly all of its Macedonian territory to the new state of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and had to give Dobruja back to the Romanians (see also Dobruja, Western Outlands, Western Thrace).

==Macedonian Front==
{{Main|Macedonian Front}}

In 1915 the Austrians gained military support from Germany and, with diplomacy, brought in Bulgaria as an ally. Serbian forces were attacked from both north and south and were forced to retreat through Montenegro and Albania, with only 155,000 Serbs, mostly soldiers, reaching the coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]] and evacuated to Greece by Allied ships.

The front stabilized roughly around the Greek border, through the intervention of a Franco-British-Italian force which had landed in [[Thessaloniki|Salonica]]. The German generals had not let the Bulgarian army advance towards [[Salonika]], because they hoped they could persuade the Greeks to join the Central powers.

In 1918, after a prolonged build-up, the Allies, under the energetic French General [[Franchet d'Esperey]] leading a combined French, Serbian, Greek and British army, [[Vardar Offensive|attacked out of Greece]]. His initial victories convinced the Bulgarian government to sue for peace. He then attacked north and defeated the German and Austrian forces that tried to halt his offensive.

By October 1918 his army had [[Liberation of Serbia, Albania and Montenegro (1918)|recaptured all of Serbia]] and was preparing to invade Hungary proper. The offensive halted only because the Hungarian leadership offered to surrender in November 1918.

The Russians had to pour extra divisions and supplies to keep the Romanian army from being utterly destroyed again by the Austro-Hungarian and Bulgarian army.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} According to John Keegan, the Russian Chief of Staff, General [[Mikhail Vasilevich Alekseev|Alekseev]], was very dismissive of the Romanian army and argued that they would drain, rather than add to the Russian reserves.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World War I|last=Keegan|first=John|publisher=Vintage|year=2000|isbn=0375700455|location=|pages=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The French and British kept six divisions each on the Greek frontier from 1916 till the end of 1918. Originally, the French and British went to Greece to help Serbia, but with Serbia's conquest in the fall of 1915, their continued presence was pointless. For nearly three years, these divisions accomplished essentially nothing and only tied down half of the Bulgarian army, which wasn't going to go far from Bulgaria in any event.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

In fact, Keegan argues that "the installation of a violently nationalist and anti-Turkish government in Athens, led to Greek mobilization in the cause of the [[Megali Idea|"Great Idea"]] - the recovery of the Greek empire in the east - which would complicate the Allied effort to resettle the peace of Europe for years after the war ended."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Be in Belhaven''' was a music festival which took place annually in [[Scotland]] at Belhaven Park, a public park in the town centre of [[Wishaw]], [[North Lanarkshire]] 2008−2012. The first Be in Belhaven festival took place on 2 August 2008. The event was run by the Be in Belhaven Planning Group, an amalgamation of local volunteer groups, Wishaw Patch Voice and Friends of Belhaven, as a free charity event with donations on the day of the event going to a chosen charity. The main beneficiary being Maggie's Cancer Centers  In Particular Maggie's Lanarkshire Interim service at [[Wishaw General Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wishawpress.co.uk/wishaw-news/tm_headline=summer-gig-is-hotting-up&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=21088629&amp;siteid=50144-name_page.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2008 ==

=== Planning ===
In the Autumn of 2007, Friends of Belhaven, a Belhaven Park community group, approached Wishaw Patch Voice, a local youth group known locally for running music events, about providing live music for a family fun day. As one thing led to another, the family funday became a fully fledged music festival.

=== Event ===

The event rook place on 2 August and was run as a Music Festival and a Family Funday.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfam.org.uk/get_involved/fundraise/oxjam/article.php?ref=163&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the Main Stage there was also an Acoustic Tent run by the [[Foundry Music Lab]], a Recording studio run by [[Wet Wet Wet]] guitarist Graeme Duffin. There was also many activities put on for young children in a bid to attract people along early in the day with the music becoming the main focus later in the day.
Headliners for the event were Glasgow girl band [[The Hedrons]] who, having already had chart success, was seen as a real coup. Negotiations with other chart acts [[The Holloways]] and [[The Rumble Strips]] had broken down. 34 other bands also played the event including tribute act, [[The Underground Jam]] and local bands such as [[Rocketfox]], [[The Lafontaines]], [[The Down &amp; Outs]], [[The Jackanoorys]], [[Station Sound]], [[The Seventeenth Century]] and [[Opportunity Club]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfam.org.uk/get_involved/fundraise/oxjam/aud_event.php?ref=1755&amp;back=aud_search_results.php%3Fdate%3D02%2BAug%2B2008%26range%3D0%26event%3D%26postcode%3D%26venue%3D%26region%3D%26genres%3D%26types%3D%26offset%3D0&lt;/ref&gt;

The event turned out to be a much greater success than anticipated, attracting over 6000 people on the day and raising £2500 for Oxfam, making it the largest Oxjam ever at that point in time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wishawpress.co.uk/wishaw-news/local-wishaw-news/wishaw-news/2008/12/03/music-festival-raised-2500-for-charity-76495-22387907/&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally the event was seen a success by the local community and police force and heralded as a "modern take on the gala day". Despite there being a large number of people on site along with a licensed bar, there was no incidents in the park.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wishawpress.co.uk/lifestyle/lifestyle-news-features/2008/08/13/belhaven-event-struck-right-chord-76495-21517120/&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2009 ==

=== Planning ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File: Bibcrowds.JPG|thumb|180px|right|The people of Wishaw descend on Belhaven Park{{deletable image-caption|Sunday, 20 December 2009}}]] --&gt;
After the overwhelming success of the 2008 festival, there was demand to stage it as an annual event. Plans were put in place in late 2008 and the decision was made to keep the event in Belhaven Park despite the inevitable increase in size off the event.
At an early stage management of local establishment The Commercial Hotel got on board as a main sponsor of the event, handling the bars and catering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wishawpress.co.uk/wishaw-news//tm_headline=belhaven-park-music-event-will-be-bigger-and-better-this-year&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=23435480&amp;siteid=76495-name_page.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Feedback suggested that the event be kept as to local bands thus keeping the community vibe, although 2008 favourites, The Underground Jam, were invited back to close the event. This led to auditions for the main stage being held with the hope of uncovering some hidden gems in the local community, one band that turned up chancing their luck actually opened the festival. The Foundry Music Lab ran a new stage while Aromas Cafe took over the acoustic tent.&lt;ref name="wishawpress.co.uk"&gt;http://www.wishawpress.co.uk/wishaw-news/local-wishaw-news/wishaw-news/2009/08/12/are-you-gonna-be-in-belhaven-this-weekend-76495-24373403/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Event ===
Be in Belhaven 2009 took place on Saturday, 15 August.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogadmin.oxfam.org.uk/get_involved/fundraise/oxjam/aud_event.php?ref=2503{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the music and funday events there was also a community learning village, fun fair attractions, Dance tent and a chainsaw carver.

Over 50 acts performed on 3 stages over the day, raising money for Oxfam and Maggies Centres.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wishawpress.co.uk/wishaw-news/local-wishaw-news/wishaw-news/2009/08/19/belhaven-the-only-place-to-be-at-fest-class-event-76495-24471639/&lt;/ref&gt; The acts included [[Still Vintage]], [[The Underground Jam]], [[The Lafontaines]], [[Tempercalm]], [[MakethisRelate]], Dear Stars guitarist Stephen Archieblad's former band Midas, [[The Jackanoorys]], [[Station Sound]], [[Crossfire (band)|Crossfire]] and [[Annie Stevenson]].&lt;ref name="wishawpress.co.uk"/&gt; [[Wet Wet Wet]] guitarist [[Graeme Duffin]] made a special appearance in the Foundry Music Lab Arena alongside [[JJ Gilmour]], of [[The Silencers (band)|The Silencers]] fame. The event was once again more successful than anticipated as over 10,000 people and went on to raise around £6000 for charity.

== 2010 ==

=== Planning ===
Be in Belhaven returned for a third year in 2010 on 7 August. Maggies Cancer Centres became the sole beneficiary of the event for the first time. The practical side of the event didn't vary much from the 2009 event other than a bigger bar area and a much larger main stage.

=== Event ===
Even more acts than before performed at the event, this time around 65. Among these acts were headliners [[The Beatles]], a Beatles tribute act, local heroes [[Crossfire (band)|Crossfire]], Leeds boys [[The Stella Frays]], [[The Lafontaines]], [[MakethisRelate]], and [[Vigo Thieves]].[[Wet Wet Wet]] guitarist [[Graeme Duffin]] made a special appearance in the Foundry Music Lab Arena playing with family members under the guise of [[The Duffins]]. The event was regarded as a success as around 10,000 people attended the event on the day.

== 2011 ==

=== Planning ===
After three successful years, Be in Belhaven returns to cement its place as North Lanarkshire's biggest annual festival. The event is due to take place on Saturday 13 August.

== 2012 ==

The same fair event is on Saturday 11 August 2012.

The '''British Formula Ford Championship''' was an entry level [[single seater]] motor sport category, designed to give racing drivers their first step into car racing after [[karting]]. Drivers from across the world were attracted to the [[United Kingdom]] to compete in the series, and successful [[Formula One]] drivers such as [[Ayrton Senna]] and [[Jenson Button]] won their first single-seater titles in the championship. The championship was run to various [[Formula Ford]] regulations over the years, based on the engines provided for the championship by [[Ford Motor Company]]. These engine based regulations/specifications include the [[Ford Kent engine]], [[Ford Zetec engine]], [[Ford Duratec engine]] and in the final years the [[Ford EcoBoost engine]].

From the 2015 season onwards, the championship will be replaced by [[MSA Formula]], which conforms to the FIA's new [[Formula 4]] regulations. Many of the teams and drivers which competed in the final season of British Formula Ford will move to the new series.

==History==
[[File:Formula Ford Duratec .4.jpg|thumb|Formula Ford Duratec car from [[Mygale]], [[Ray Formula Cars|Ray]] and [[Van Diemen]]]]
Although the first British Formula Ford Championship was not held until 1976, Formula Ford's roots are firmly situated in the British racing scene. The first Formula Ford race was held at [[Brands Hatch]] in 1967 and was the precursor to the birth of the domestic championship. The first British Formula Ford Championship, held in 1976, was the original Formula Ford Championship which gave birth to many others over the years, including successful championships in [[Australian Formula Ford Championship|Australia]] and [[New Zealand Formula Ford Championship|New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=FFhistory&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.britishformulaford.com/history|title=The History of Formula Ford Racing|publisher=[britishformulaford.com]|accessdate=30 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016042737/http://www.britishformulaford.com/history|archivedate=16 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The championship started out with the 1600cc [[Ford Kent engine]] and continued to use it until [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] introduced its newer, more powerful 1800cc [[Ford Zetec engine]]. Although this engine change didn't affect the other technical regulations, which still called for steel [[space frame]]s which were much more economical to build and run compared to their [[carbon fiber]] counterparts, the increased engine power accelerated chassis development, causing many of the smaller manufacturers stopped producing cars, resulting in fewer constructors represented in the championship.&lt;ref name=zetechistory&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.formulafordzetec.co.uk/formula_ford_zetec_004.htm|title=History |publisher=[formulafordzetec.co.uk]|accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zetec regulations lasted only 12 years up until the [[Ford Duratec engine]] was introduced in 2006, providing better handling and power due to its lighter weight even though the specification had returned to 1600cc engines.&lt;ref name=FFhistory/&gt;

The biggest changes to the championship came in [[2012 British Formula Ford Championship|2012]] when the latest [[Ford EcoBoost engine]] and specification was adopted as the main championship. The EcoBoost car marks a substantial change in the direction of Formula Ford racing as it introduces both smaller capacity [[Turbocharged petrol engines]] and for the first time a [[Sequential manual transmission|sequential gearbox]].&lt;ref name=zetechistory/&gt;

==The car==
[[File:Formula Ford Ecoboost 2012 4.jpg|thumb|2012 Formula Ford EcoBoost Car]]
The championship currently allows two specification of [[Formula Ford]] car to race: the current generation EcoBoost car and the previous generation Duratec car. The championship is multi-chassis, featuring manufacturers such as [[Van Diemen]] and [[Mygale]]. To help keep costs low, cars are made from steel, as opposed to the more exotic carbon fibre commonly found in higher categories of racing. The Duratec cars were introduced in 2006, when all the cars in the series were required to use the 1600cc [[Naturally aspirated engine|Naturally aspirated]] [[Ford Duratec engine]] which replaced the [[Ford Kent engine]] that had been used since the championships inception. Beginning in [[2012 British Formula Ford Championship|2012]], the EcoBoost class was introduced to run as the premier class alongside a secondary class for the aging Duratec cars. The EcoBoost class utilises Ford's latest [[Ford EcoBoost engine|EcoBoost engine]] which provides greater power thanks to the introduction of a [[Turbocharged petrol engines|Turbo Charger]]. The chassis however remains a steel [[space frame]] rather than the [[carbon fibre]] [[Monocoque]] found in other formulae.&lt;ref name=2012regs/&gt;

From 2015 onwards, the MSA Formula will use [[Formula 4]] regulations. [[Mygale]] will continue to provide the carbon-fibre monocoque chassis (As opposed to the [[Tatuus]] supplied chassis used in [[BRDC Formula 4 Championship|BRDC F4]]. The engine will be a [[Ford]] 1.6L [[EcoBoost]] engine as used in the more modern Formula Ford cars, tuned to a maximum of 160 PS. All engines will be tuned by the same race engine preparer, in an attempt to reduce costs. Similarly, all tyres will be provided by [[Hankook]]. Sadev will provide the sequential paddle shift transmission and data logging system.

==The Championship==
From 2013, the championship is composed of 30 rounds held at ten events in support of the [[British Touring Car Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.btcc.net/html/generalnews_detail.php?id=3211 |title=Formula Ford returns in 2013 |work=[[British Touring Car Championship]] |publisher=[[TOCA]] |date=12 October 2012 |accessdate=12 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723101130/http://www.btcc.net/html/generalnews_detail.php?id=3211 |archivedate=23 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both EcoBoost and Duratec classes compete in the same races as each other. Drivers who have competed in less than 4 junior formula races in the past are eligible to compete for the Rookie Cup, whilst both Teams and Constructors have separate championships for themselves. The Nations Cup is awarded to the highest placed registered driver from each country excluding UK.&lt;ref name=2012regs&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brscc.co.uk/assets/2012-dunlopmsaformulafordchampionshipofgbregulations-msa-approved--copy.pdf|title=2012 Formula Ford GB Regulations|work=British Formula Ford Championship|publisher=[[BRSCC]]|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the series will again run 30 rounds at ten events in support of the BTCC, despite becoming the MSA Formula.

===Weekend Format===
A 20-minute qualifying session is used to decide the grid for the all the weekends races. The drivers fastest lap decides the grid for race one, their second fastest time decides the grid for race two and their third fastest time, the grid for race three. All three races will be run over 15 miles.&lt;ref name=2012regs/&gt;

==Other UK Championships==
Such was the popularity of the formula in the UK over its history; there is an abundance of second hand chassis from previous generations of the championship. This has led to the formation of several other national and club level championships within the UK catering for legacy chassis, engines and cars.
*'''[[British Racing and Sports Car Club|BRSCC]] Formula Ford [[Ford Duratec engine|Duratec]] Championship''' - Created at the end of 2012, the proposed championship will give a home to the previous generation  Duratec class Formula Fords after the British Championship switched solely to the new EcoBoost class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brscc.co.uk/BRSCC-ANNOUNCES-PLANS-FOR-DURATEC-FORMULA-FORD|title=BRSCC ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR DURATEC FORMULA FORD|work=[[BRSCC]]|publisher=[[BRSCC]]|date=29 October 2012|accessdate=30 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112070630/http://www.brscc.co.uk/BRSCC-ANNOUNCES-PLANS-FOR-DURATEC-FORMULA-FORD#|archive-date=2015-01-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Formula Ford 1600 Championships''' - Operated by the [[British Racing and Sports Car Club|BRSCC]], this championship caters for cars built to the Kent specification, utilising the [[Ford Kent engine]]. Consisting of two regional and one national championship, it give opportunities for a range of drivers to showcase their talents. A two class structure based around the construction year of the chassis allows a range of different chassis to remain competitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brscc.co.uk/Championships/AVON-TYRES-FORMULA-FORD-CHAMPIONSHIPS|title=AVON TYRES FORMULA FORD CHAMPIONSHIPS|work=[[BRSCC]]|publisher=[[BRSCC]]|accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Several Club level championships are also arranged. Of note include the '''[[Monoposto Racing Club]] Championship'''[http://www.monoposto.co.uk/], the '''[[750 Motor Club]] Formula 4''' championship [https://web.archive.org/web/20120701193852/http://www.750mc.co.uk/F-formula-4.php], the '''[[Castle Combe Circuit|Castle Combe]] Formula Free''' championship [http://www.castlecombecircuit.co.uk/racingclub/] and the '''Classic Formula Ford Championship'''[http://www.classicformulaford.com/].

===Formula Ford Festival===
{{main|Formula Ford Festival}}
The '''Formula Ford Festival''' is an annual meeting of [[Ford]] powered [[Formula racing|single seat racing]] cars which is held at the end of the British racing season, at the [[Brands Hatch]] motor racing circuit in the county of [[Kent]], in [[Southern England]]. The events are held over the course of a weekend and although various classes of past and present Formula Fords are present, the high point for many is the championship in which young but skilled drivers from Ford competitions in Europe and beyond race against one another. Often it is a rare chance to compare the skills of drivers who take part in different Ford competitions across the world. The event is administered by the [[British Racing and Sports Car Club]].

The Chunnakam Police station massacre refers to the killing of 19 ethnic [[Sri Lankan Tamil|Tamil]] civilians by the [[Sri Lankan Police]], at [[Chunnakam]], a suburb of [[Jaffna]] in 1984. This was among the first of the series of massacres of Tamil civilians by the [[Sri Lankan military|Sri Lankan state forces]], since the outbreak of the civil war in the country.

==Massacre==
Chunnakam is situated in the Uduvil Assistant Government Agent Division in the [[Jaffna District]].Ten kilometers from the Jaffna town, on the [[Kankesanthurai]] road, there is the Chunnakam Junction situated. The Chunnakam Police station was located about 250 metres south of this junction.

Many Tamil youth had been previously arrested since the [[Four Four Bravo|escalation of conflict]] between the Army and the Tamil groups in the [[Jaffna peninsula|peninsula]]. Almost all of them were arrested under the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) without evidence and were kept in various government buildings in the region.

On 8 January 1984, the State Police placed a time bomb in the Chunnakam Police station where at least 19 Tamil youth were held under the POTA and left the building. When the bomb exploded, all of them inside were killed. One lad who attempted to rescue his friends inside also lost his life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2853">'''Culpable and Reckless Conduct''' is a [[Common Law]] offence under [[Scots Law]].

The offence has no specific definition but deals with acts involving a criminal degree of recklessness which cause injury to other persons or create a risk of such injury. It will often be charged in parallel with other offences such as [[Wilful fire raising]] where it is clear that a criminal offence has occurred but the exact offence(s) committed need to be determined by the facts proven in court. The offence carries a maximum punishment of life imprisonment but the circumstances (and thus the eventual sentence applied) of individual cases will often fall short of requiring such a punishment and might not proceed beyond the [[Sheriff court]] which has limited sentencing powers.

The offence does not deal with events which involve only civil liability such as injuries caused by [[Delict (Scots law)|negligence]] which does not amount to a criminal act. It does apply to many events which, had they occurred in [[England and Wales]], would have been the same offence whether they were caused intentionally or recklessly but in Scotland fail to fall within the substantive offence due to a lack of intention. This is demonstrated in many cases where an offender is charged with another offence (e.g. [[Wilful fire raising]]) as well as this offence and the eventual offence(s) for which the offender might be committed is determined by the proven intentions.

While there is no statutory definition, a summary of what constitutes the offence can be inferred from a draft Scottish Legal Code&lt;ref&gt;A Draft Criminal Code for Scotland with Commentary, pub. Scottish Law Commission 2003&lt;/ref&gt; which drew upon current law and proposed the following for a statutory offence of ''Recklessness'' :-
:Recklessness
::For the purposes of criminal liability ⎯
::(a) something is caused recklessly if the person causing the result is, or ought to be, aware of an obvious and serious risk that acting will bring about the result but nonetheless acts where no reasonable person would do so;
::(b) a person is reckless as to a circumstance, or as to a possible result of an act, if the person is, or ought to be, aware of an obvious and serious risk that the circumstance exists, or that the result will follow, but nonetheless acts where no reasonable person would do so;
::(c) a person acts recklessly if the person is, or ought to be, aware of an obvious and serious risk of dangers or of possible harmful results in so acting but nonetheless acts where no reasonable person would do so.

"'''Daily Nightly'''" is a [[song]] by [[Michael Nesmith]] of [[The Monkees]], which appeared on their fourth album, ''[[Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn &amp; Jones Ltd.]]'', in 1967, and was featured in two second-season episodes of their [[The Monkees (TV series)| television series]], "A Fairy Tale" and "Monkees Blow Their Minds".

The lyrics are a veiled commentary on the [[Sunset Strip curfew riots]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/article/monkees-daily-nightly-introduced-rock-world-moog-225208 ''A.V. Club'' "The Monkees’ "Daily Nightly" introduced the rock world to the Moog"  By Gwen Ihnat, September 15, 2015. AVClub.com.]&lt;/ref&gt; which occurred in [[Hollywood, California]] in late 1966. The record was arguably the very first rock recording to feature the [[Robert Moog|Moog]] [[Moog synthesizer|synthesizer]], programmed by musician [[Paul Beaver]] and played by [[Micky Dolenz]], who was the third owner of a Moog; the fills he played were described as "spacey UFO noises", and were characteristic of [[psychedelic music]], which was then in vogue. The Moog sections were significantly different between the stereo and mono mixes of the track. Dolenz also provided the vocals. A [[music video]] in [[black and white]] was made for the series, with Dolenz miming his performance.

The song is simple musically, using the [[chord (music)|chords]] A Major, C Major, D Major, and E Major.

The song appears on the third CD of the 2009 [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino]] compilation ''[[Where the Action Is! Los Angeles Nuggets 1965–1968]]''.

==Live versions==

The song has been a regular inclusion in the setlist of the 2012 An Evening with the Monkees tour featuring Nesmith, Dolenz, &amp; [[Peter Tork]].  During the song, Nesmith vocally performs an interpretation of the original Moog sound effects.  According to Dolenz, the song was never performed live prior to 2012.

==Overview==
A {{convert|1600|kg|adj=on}} spacecraft will be launched on board a [[Vega (rocket)|Vega]] rocket into a [[polar orbit]] at an altitude of {{convert|800-1000|km|mi}}. Once on orbit, the spacecraft will [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] with a derelict satellite in an unknown condition, inoperative, and probably tumbling.&lt;ref name="GizmagFishing" /&gt;

Capture will be conducted in one of two ways: either by using mechanical tentacles or nets. The tentacles option includes equipping the spacecraft with robotic arms, one of which will first capture a holding point, before the remaining arms embrace the derelict and secure it with a clamping mechanism. The net option includes equipping the spacecraft with a deployable net on a tether, that will envelop the target derelict before the spacecraft will begin changing orbit.&lt;ref name="CDFstudy2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iaassconference2013.space-safety.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2013/06/1200_Biesbroek_Innocenti.pdf|title=The e.Deorbit CDF Study|format=PDF|author=Robin Biesbroek|date=22 May 2013|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13,24,25}} The net option has the advantage of being able to capture objects with a wide range of sizes and spins.&lt;ref name="VOnets"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.voanews.com/science-world/2015/03/23/fishing-in-outer-space-for-bigger-junk/|title=Fishing in Outer Space for Bigger Junk|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|author=Rick Pantaleo|date=23 March 2015|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After successfully capturing the targeted derelict, the spacecraft will deorbit itself by performing a controlled [[atmospheric reentry]].&lt;ref name="ESAheading"/&gt;

==History==
The mission was developed at ESA's [[Concurrent Design Facility]], with studies for the Clean Space programme on de-orbiting techniques being carried out in 2009.&lt;ref name="ESAheading" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CDFcleanSpace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/CDF/Clean_Space|title=Clean Space|publisher=ESA, [[Concurrent Design Facility]]|date=3 October 2012|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first symposium about the mission took place in May 2014.&lt;ref name="ESAconference1"/&gt; Early testing included successful attempts at capturing scale model satellites by shooting nets from compressed air ejectors.&lt;ref name="VOnets" /&gt; The first design stage was completed in June 2015, with a systems requirements review being conducted in May–June 2016 and a final mission approval taking place in December 2016.&lt;ref name="ESAheading" /&gt;

{{Scramble for Africa}}

The '''Fashoda Incident''' or '''Crisis''' was the climax of [[empire|imperial]] territorial disputes between [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] in [[East Africa|Eastern Africa]], occurring in 1898. A French expedition to [[Kodok|Fashoda]] on the [[White Nile]] river sought to gain control of the [[Nile|Upper Nile river basin]] and thereby exclude Britain from the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]]. The French party and a British-Egyptian force (outnumbering the French by 10 to 1) met on friendly terms, but back in Europe, it became a war scare. The British held firm as both empires stood on the verge of war with heated rhetoric on both sides. Under heavy pressure the French withdrew, securing Anglo-Egyptian control over the area. The status quo was recognised by an agreement between the two states acknowledging British control over Egypt, while France became the dominant power in [[Morocco]]. France had failed in its main goals.  P.M.H. Bell says:
:"Between the two governments there was a brief battle of wills, with the British insisting on immediate and unconditional French withdrawal from Fashoda. The French had to accept these terms, amounting to a public humiliation....Fashoda was long remembered in France as an example of British brutality and injustice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=P. M. H. Bell|title=France and Britain, 1900–1940: Entente and Estrangement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mr-OAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|year=2014|publisher=Routledge|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a diplomatic victory for the British as the French realized that in the long run they needed the friendship of Britain in case of a war between France and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P. Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe, 1848–1918'' (1954) pp 381–88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Brogan, France under the Republic: The Development of Modern France (1870–1930) (1940) pp 321–26&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the last crisis between the two that involved a threat of war (until 1940&lt;ref&gt;A reference to the sinking by the Royal Navy of French warships at Mers-el-Kébir on 3 July 1940, following the fall of France. Vichy France broke off diplomatic relations with Britain but did not declare war.&lt;/ref&gt;) and opened the way for closer relations in the [[Entente cordiale]] of 1904. It gave rise to the '[[Fashoda syndrome]]' in French foreign policy, or seeking to assert French influence in areas which might be becoming susceptible to British influence.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Langer, ''The diplomacy of imperialism: 1890–1902'' (1951) pp 537–80&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
During the late 19th century, Africa was rapidly being claimed and exploited by European colonial powers. After the 1885 [[Berlin Conference]] regarding West Africa, Europe's great powers went after any remaining lands in Africa that were not already under another European nation's influence. This period in [[History of Africa|African history]] is usually called the [[Scramble for Africa]]. The two principal powers involved in this scramble were Britain and France, along with Germany, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Pakenham, ''Scramble for Africa: The White Man's Conquest of the Dark Continent from 1876–1912'' (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

The French thrust into the African interior was mainly from the continent's Atlantic coast (modern [[Senegal]]) eastward, through the [[Sahel]] along the southern border of the [[Sahara]], a territory covering modern Senegal, [[Mali]], [[Niger]], and [[Chad]]. Their ultimate goal was to have an uninterrupted link between the [[Niger River]] and the [[Nile]], hence controlling all trade to and from the Sahel region, by virtue of their existing control over the [[Camel train|caravan]] routes through the Sahara. France also had an outpost near the mouth of the [[Red Sea]] in [[Djibouti]] ([[French Somaliland]]), which could serve as an eastern anchor to an east-west belt of French territory across the continent.&lt;ref&gt;William Roger Louis, and Prosser Gifford, eds. ''France and Britain in Africa: imperial rivalry and colonial rule'' (Yale University Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

The British, on the other hand, wanted to link their possessions in [[Southern Africa]] ([[South Africa]], [[Bechuanaland]] and [[Rhodesia]]), with their territories in [[East Africa]] (modern [[Kenya]]), and these two areas with the Nile basin. [[Sudan]], which then included today's [[South Sudan]] and [[Uganda]], was the key to the fulfilment of these ambitions, especially since [[Egypt]] was already under British control. This 'red line' (i.e. a proposed railway, see [[Cape to Cairo Railway]]) through Africa was made most famous by the British and South African political force [[Cecil Rhodes]], who wanted Africa "painted [British] Red".&lt;ref&gt;Louis and Gifford, eds. ''France and Britain in Africa: imperial rivalry and colonial rule'' (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

If one draws a line from [[Cape Town]] to [[Cairo]] (Rhodes' dream) and another line from [[Dakar]] to [[French Somaliland]] (now [[Djibouti]]) by the Red Sea in the Horn (the French ambition), these two lines intersect in eastern [[South Sudan]] near the town of Fashoda (present-day [[Kodok]]), explaining its strategic importance. The French east-west axis and the British north-south axis could not co-exist; the nation that could occupy and hold the crossing of the two axes would be the only one able to proceed with its plan.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Fashoda was also bound up in the Egyptian Question, a long running dispute between the United Kingdom and France over the legality of the [[British occupation of Egypt]]. Since 1882 many French politicians, particularly those of the ''parti colonial'', had come to regret France’s decision not to join with Britain in occupying the country. They hoped to force Britain to leave, and thought that a colonial outpost on the Upper Nile could serve as a base for French gunboats. These in turn were expected to make the British abandon Egypt. Another proposed scheme involved a massive dam, cutting off the Nile’s water supply and forcing the British out. These ideas were highly impractical, but they succeeded in alarming many British officials.&lt;ref&gt;Henri L. Wesseling, ''Divide and conquer: The partition of Africa, 1880–1914'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LeCommandantMarchand.jpg|thumb|Contemporary illustration of Major Marchand's trek across Africa.]]

A French force of only 120 [[Senegalese Tirailleurs|''tirailleurs'']] (Senegalese infantrymen) plus 12 French officers, non-commissioned officers and support staff — Captain Marcel Joseph Germain, Captain Albert Baratier, Captain [[Charles Mangin]], Captain Victor Emmanuel Largeau, Lieutenant Félix Fouqué, teacher Dyé, doctor Jules Emily Major, Warrant Officer De Prat, Sergeant George Dat, Sergeant Bernard, Sergeant Venail and the military interpreter Landerouin — set out from [[Brazzaville]] in a borrowed Belgian steamer, under Major [[Jean-Baptiste Marchand]] with orders to secure the area around Fashoda, and make it a French protectorate. They steamed up the [[Ubangi River]] to its [[head of navigation]] and then marched overland through jungle and scrub to the deserts of Sudan. They travelled across Sudan to the Nile River. They were to be met there by two expeditions coming from the east across [[Ethiopia]], one of which, from [[Djibouti]], was led by [[Christian de Bonchamps]], veteran of the [[Stairs Expedition to Katanga]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Côte, Mission de Bonchamps: ''Vers Fachoda à la rencontre de la mission Marchand à travers l’Ethiopie'', Paris, Plon, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a difficult 14-month trek across the heart of Africa, the Marchand Expedition arrived on 10 July 1898, but the de Bonchamps Expedition failed to make it after being ordered by the Ethiopians to halt, and then suffering accidents in the [[Baro River|Baro]] Gorge.  Marchand's small force was thus alone.&lt;ref&gt;Levering Lewis, David: ''The Race to Fashoda'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, New York (1987, 1995) pp. 133, 135, 210.&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September a [[flotilla]] of five British [[gunboat]]s arrived at the isolated Fashoda fort. They carried 1,500 British and Egyptian/Sudanese soldiers, led by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Sir Herbert Kitchener]] and including Lieutenant-Colonel (later General) [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas |last=Pakenham|page=548|title=The Scramble for Africa|ISBN=0-349-10449-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marchand had received incorrect reports that the approaching force consisted of [[Dervishes]] but now found himself facing a diplomatic rather than a military crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas |last=Pakenham|page=547|title=The Scramble for Africa|ISBN=0-349-10449-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the commander of the Anglo-Egyptian army that had just defeated the forces of the [[Mahdi]] at the [[Battle of Omdurman]], Kitchener was in the process of reconquering the Sudan in the name of the Egyptian [[Khedive]], and after the battle he opened sealed orders to investigate the French expedition. Kitchener, a fluent French speaker, landed at Fashoda wearing Egyptian Army uniform, and the two commanders behaved with admirable restraint.  Both sides insisted on their right to Fashoda but agreed to wait for further instructions from home.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Moorehead, ''The White Nile'', Hamish Hamilton, London, 1962, also published by Penguin&lt;/ref&gt;

News of the meeting was relayed to [[Paris]] and [[London]], where it inflamed the imperial pride of both nations. Widespread popular outrage followed, each side accusing the other of naked expansionism and aggression. The crisis continued throughout September and October. The Royal Navy drafted war orders and mobilized its reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas |last=Pakenham|page=552|title=The Scramble for Africa|ISBN=0-349-10449-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resolution ==
[[File:No Fight - JM Staniforth.png|thumb|1898 political cartoon: A French poodle begs for scraps from a British bulldog]]
In naval terms, the situation was heavily in Britain's favour, a fact that French deputies acknowledged in the aftermath of the crisis.  Significant credit has been given to Marchand for remaining calm.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison Beall Giffen, ''Fashoda, the Incident and Its Diplomatic Setting'' (1930) pp 78–98 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The military facts were undoubtedly important to [[Théophile Delcassé]], the newly appointed French foreign minister. "They have soldiers. We only have arguments," he said resignedly. Besides he saw no advantage in a colonial war with the British, especially since he was keen to gain their friendship in case of any future conflict with Germany. He therefore pressed hard for a peaceful resolution of the crisis although it encouraged a tide of nationalism and anglophobia. In a scathing editorial published in  [[L’Intransigeant]] on 13 October [[Victor Henri Rochefort, Marquis de Rochefort-Luçay|Victor Henri Rochefort]] wrote, "Germany keeps slapping us in the face. Let’s not offer our cheek to England."&lt;ref&gt;Vaïsse, Maurice, ''L'entente cordiale de Fachoda à la Grande Guerre : Dans les archives du Quai d'Orsay'', Editions Complexe, 2004, {{ISBN|978-2804800062}}, pp.15–16&lt;/ref&gt; According to nationalists France’s capitulation was clear evidence that the French army had been severely weakened by the traitors who supported [[Alfred Dreyfus|Dreyfus]]. Yet the reopening of the [[Dreyfus Affair]] in January had done much to distract French public opinion from events in the [[Sudan]] and with people increasingly questioning the wisdom of a war over such a remote part of Africa, the French government quietly ordered its soldiers to withdraw on 3 November and the crisis ended peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Langer, ''The diplomacy of imperialism: 1890–1902'' (1951) pp 537–80&lt;/ref&gt; Marchand chose to withdraw his small force by way of Abyssinia and [[Djibouti]], rather than cross Anglo/Egyptian territory by taking the relatively quick journey by steamer up the Nile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas |last=Pakenham|page=555|title=The Scramble for Africa|ISBN=0-349-10449-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1899, the French and British [[Anglo-French Convention of 1898|agreed]] that the source of the [[Nile]] and the [[Congo River|Congo]] rivers should mark the frontier between their spheres of influence.

The Fashoda incident was the last serious colonial dispute between Britain and France, and its classic diplomatic solution is considered by most historians to be the precursor of the [[Entente Cordiale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=La Belle France |last=Horne |first=Alistair |year=2004 |publisher=Vintage |location=USA |isbn=978-1-4000-3487-1 |pages=298–299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main protagonists are commemorated in the Pont Kitchener-Marchand, a {{convert|116|m|adj=on}} road bridge over the Saône, completed in 1959 in the French city of Lyon.

In 1904, Fashoda was officially renamed Kodok. It is located in modern-day [[South Sudan]].

'''''Fricke v. Lynch,''''' 491 F.Supp. 381 (1980), was a decision in the [[United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island]] that upheld the right of a [[gay]] student to bring a same-sex date to a [[high school]] dance. The Court ruled that existing [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|free speech doctrine]] protected gay and lesbian students' rights to attend their proms with same-sex dates of their choice. The case was "one of the first successful victories in the courtroom for an [[LGBT]] issue involving young people, and is routinely cited each year in numerous cases surrounding the rights of students to bring same-sex dates to school functions."

==Background==
In April 1979, a [[gay]] high school junior named Paul Guilbert sought his [[principal (education)|principal]]'s permission to bring a male date, Ed Miskevich, a senior at Brown University, to his junior prom at [[Cumberland High School (Rhode Island)|Cumberland High School]] in [[Rhode Island]]. The principal, Richard Lynch, "denied the request, fearing that student reaction could lead to a disruption at the dance and possibly to physical harm to Guilbert."&lt;ref name="Decision" /&gt; The Cumberland School Department denied a public hearing to Paul Guilbert because his father opposed his plan to attend with a male date.&lt;ref&gt;Arizona Gay News: [http://www.tucsonobserver.com/archives/pdf/1979/04/APR%2020.pdf "Father, school say boy can't take a male date to the prom," April 20, 1979] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514235747/http://www.tucsonobserver.com/archives/pdf/1979/04/APR%2020.pdf |date=2006-05-14 }}, accessed March 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Guilbert and Miskevich did not attend the prom.

The next year, Guilbert's friend [[Aaron Fricke]], who was also a gay student at Cumberland High School, again asked Lynch for permission to bring a same-sex date to a school dance. Lynch denied the request in a letter to Fricke citing the "real and present threat of physical harm to [Fricke], [his] male escort and to others."&lt;ref name="Decision"&gt;ACLU: [https://www.aclu.org/FilesPDFs/fricke.pdf ''Fricke v. Lynch'', May 28, 1980], accessed March 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynch also wrote that "the adverse effect among [Fricke's] classmates, other students, the School and the Town of Cumberland, which is certain to follow approval of such a request for overt homosexual interaction (male or female) at a class function" was sufficient ground for rejecting the request.&lt;ref name="Decision" /&gt;

Fricke, represented by John Ward of [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders]], filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island]], seeking a [[preliminary injunction]] that would allow him to attend the dance.

==Decision==
The Court, accepting Fricke's [[freedom of speech]] claim, decided that "even a legitimate interest in school discipline does not outweigh a student's right to peacefully express his views in an appropriate time, place, and manner."&lt;ref name="Decision" /&gt; The Court wrote that threats of physical violence against Fricke and his date gave [[homophobia|homophobic]] students an [[unconstitutional]] "[[heckler's veto]]" that would allow "them to decide through prohibited and violent methods what speech will be heard."&lt;ref name="Decision" /&gt;

The judge ruled that the precedent of ''[[United States v. O'Brien]]'', 391 U.S. 367, 88 S. Ct. 1673, 20 L. Ed. 2d 672 (1968), was the appropriate framework for judging the constitutionality of Lynch's decision. ''O'Brien'' required that the government and its agents pursue the "least restrictive alternative" before making any decision to limit [[free speech]]. The judge ruled that Lynch's decision failed to meet the requirement of ''O'Brien'' because the school could have taken "appropriate security measures to control the risk of harm" and the principal had not made "any effort to determine the need for and logistics of additional security." The judge ruled that "the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] requires that such steps" be taken to investigate and implement security measures.&lt;ref name="Decision" /&gt;

The Court found the free speech claim to be [[dispositive]] and did not address Fricke's free association and [[equal protection]] arguments. With the respect to [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]] arguments, the court noted that "the school [had] afforded disparate treatment to a certain class of students" by setting up different policies for those who wished to bring same-sex partners to the dance and those who wanted to bring different-sex partners. Such a policy, the Court said, could be "profitably analyzed under the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]."&lt;ref name="Decision" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
On May 31, 1980, the press reports said that "Amid heavy security, homosexual student Aaron Fricke showed up at the senior prom with a male companion. Both wore tuxedos." Lynch addressed the senior class earlier in the day and promised to respond to any harassment of the couple with "very stern measures." The school provided six rather than the customary two police officers for security. Some students taunted the couple when they danced together.&lt;ref&gt;Google News: [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19800531&amp;id=-a5hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3OEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4621,9325617 "Six police protect homosexual, date at school's prom," May 31, 1980], accessed March 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''Fricke'', American public high schools have increasingly allowed gay and lesbian students to attend school functions with their same-sex partners. In 2004, [[Murray High School (Utah)|Murray High School]] in [[Utah]] prohibited same-sex students from participating in the promenade of their prom. Press coverage noted the similarity to Fricke's case.&lt;ref&gt;''Detroit News'': [http://www.gaypasg.org/gaypasg/PressClippings/2004/April%202004/utah_student_reinforces_gay_yout.htm Deb Price, "Utah student reinforces gay youth rights," April 30, 2004] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310124233/http://www.gaypasg.org/gaypasg/PressClippings/2004/April%202004/utah_student_reinforces_gay_yout.htm |date=2012-03-10 }}, accessed March 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Using ''Fricke'' as a [[precedent]], the [[ACLU]] threatened to sue the high school on behalf of its gay and lesbian students. The high school reversed its policy and allowed 17-year-old lesbian Heather Johnston to dance with her girlfriend at the prom.&lt;ref name="ACLU Demand Letter"&gt;ACLU Utah: [http://www.acluutah.org/MurrayschoolDist.pdf "ACLU demand letter," March 11, 2004] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204025703/http://www.acluutah.org/MurrayschoolDist.pdf |date=2010-12-04 }}, accessed March 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Itawamba Agricultural High School]] in [[Mississippi]] canceled its prom after pupil Constance McMillen asked to attend with her girlfriend and wear a tuxedo. She reported hostility from other students over the cancellation, and sued the school.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;Carlin DeGuerin Miller.

'''Henry Menasco Wade''' (November 11, 1914 – March 1, 2001) was a [[Texas]] lawyer who served as [[District Attorney]] of [[Dallas]] from 1951 to 1987. As such, he participated in two of the most notable U.S. court cases of the 20th century: the prosecution of [[Jack Ruby]] for killing [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s decision legalizing [[abortion]], ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. In addition, Wade was District Attorney when [[Randall Dale Adams]], the subject of the documentary film ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]'', was convicted in the murder of Robert Wood, a [[Dallas]] police officer.

==Early life==
Wade, one of eleven children,&lt;ref name=schoolnet/&gt; was born in [[Rockwall County, Texas]], outside [[Dallas]]. A good student, Wade, along with five of his seven brothers, entered the legal profession. Shortly after graduating from the [[University of Texas at Austin]], in 1939, Wade joined the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]],&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; headed by [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. Wade's assignment as Special Agent was to investigate espionage cases along the [[US East Coast]] and in [[South America]]. During [[World War II]], Wade served in the [[US Navy]], taking part in the invasions of the [[Philippines Campaign (1944–1945)|Philippines]] and [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]].

==Career==
He was first elected [[Rockwall County, Texas|Rockwall County]] Attorney. In 1947, Wade joined the [[Dallas County District Attorney]]'s Office. He won election to the top job only four years later, a position he would hold for 36 years, until his retirement in 1987.

===1956 congressional election===
Wade was the unsuccessful [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate in 1956 against the staunchly [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Representative [[Bruce Alger]] of Dallas County. Alger prevailed to win his second of five House terms, 102,380 (55.6 percent) to 81,705 (44.4 percent). After his defeat, Wade remained district attorney for another 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;''Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections'', Vol. 2, U.S. House, 6th ed., (Washington, D.C.: Congressional Quarterly, 2010), p. 1255&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kennedy assassination ===
[[File:Henry Wade 1963 press conference NYWTS.jpg|thumb|Wade conducting a press conference, November 25, 1963]]
{{see also|Ruby v. Texas}}
In the early afternoon hours of November 22, 1963, [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] in [[Downtown Dallas]], just blocks from Wade's office in the [[Dallas]] County Courthouse.&lt;ref name=commission&gt;{{cite book | last=Warren Commission | title=Hearings Before the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy | location=Washington, D.C. | publisher=United States Government Printing Office | pages=218–219 | volume=vol. 5 | url=http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh5/html/WC_Vol5_0114b.htm | year=1964 | oclc=475244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wade lost the opportunity to try [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] for Kennedy's murder when a Dallas nightclub operator, [[Jack Ruby]], shot the suspect just two days later, but he became known nationally for prosecuting Ruby for Oswald's murder. Wade closely supervised the Ruby trial, but he appointed his assistant, William Alexander, to conduct the courtroom proceedings.&lt;ref name=Bugliosi1455&gt;{{Cite book |title=Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy |last=Bugliosi |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Bugliosi |year=2007 |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |isbn=978-0-393-04525-3 |pages=1465–1466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wade and Alexander confronted Ruby's lawyers, famed trial lawyer [[Melvin Belli]] and Texas counsellor Joe Tonahill, in a lengthy trial that concluded on March 14, 1964, with a verdict for Ruby of "guilty of murder with malice." The jury had deliberated for less than three hours before arriving at its decision, and it recommended a [[death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;Bugliosi, p. 1477.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Roe v. Wade''===
{{main|Roe v. Wade}}
Wade, as [[Dallas]] County District Attorney, was the named defendant when attorneys [[Sarah Weddington]] and [[Linda Coffee]] mounted a 1970 constitutional challenge to the Texas criminal statutes prohibiting doctors from performing abortions. [[Norma McCorvey]] ("Jane Roe"), a single woman, was signed up as the representative plaintiff. The challenge sought both a declaratory judgment that the Texas criminal abortion statutes were unconstitutional on their face and an injunction restraining the defendant from enforcing the statutes. The lower court refused to grant Roe's desired injunction but declared the criminal abortion statutes were void.

Both sides cross-appealed. The case worked its way through the appellate process, culminating in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s landmark 1973 ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' decision that made [[Abortion in the United States|abortion]] legal in the [[United States]].

==Later life==
Despite the loss of ''Roe v. Wade'' and its unpopularity with conservative voters, Wade himself was not blamed, and his political career did not suffer. He continued to serve in office for an additional 14 years, and he remained a fixture around the new Crowley Courts Building, where members of the [[Dallas Bar Association|Dallas Bar]] called him "the Chief." In 1995, the Henry Wade Juvenile Justice Center was named in his honor, and in 2000, shortly before his death from [[Parkinson's disease]], ''[[Texas Lawyer]]'' magazine named him as one of the 102 most influential lawyers of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=schoolnet/&gt;

==Legacy==
Wade once again gained national attention in 1988 with the release of [[Errol Morris]]'s documentary film ''[[The Thin Blue Line (1988 film)|The Thin Blue Line]]''. The documentary tells the story of [[Randall Dale Adams]]' 1977 conviction for the murder of Robert Wood, a [[Dallas]] police officer. Adams was sentenced to death for the crime. The execution was scheduled for May 8, 1979, but US Supreme Court Justice [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.]], ordered a stay only three days before the scheduled date. Instead of conducting a new trial, [[Governor of Texas|Governor]] [[Bill Clements]] commuted Adams's sentence to life in prison. Adams was exonerated in 1988, after serving 12 years in prison. Similar cases of exonerated men have recently arisen, putting the legality of Wade's practices in question.

As of July 2008, fifteen persons convicted during Wade's term as Dallas County District Attorney have been exonerated of the crimes for which they were accused in light of new DNA evidence. Because of the culture of the department to "convict at all costs," it is suspected that more innocent people have been falsely imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview | subject=James Woodard; Eugene Henton; James Waller; Greg Wallis; James Giles; Billy Smith | title=DNA Helps Free Inmate After 27 Years | interviewer=James Woodard | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/05/02/60minutes/main4065454.shtml?source=mostpop_story  | type=Interview: Video/Transcript | work=60 Minutes | publisher=CBS | location=Dallas, Texas | date=May 4, 2008| accessdate=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Innocence Project|Project Innocence Texas]] currently has more than 250 cases under examination.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1777">{{Islamic Culture}}'''Imamat Day''' is celebrated by [[Nizari]] [[Isma'ilism|Ismaili]] [[Shia Islam|Shiʿi]] [[Muslim]]s to mark the anniversary of the day that their [[imamah (Ismaili doctrine)|present (''Hazar'') Imam]] succeeded his predecessor to become the Imam of the Time.&lt;ref name="tio-imamat-day"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.theismaili.org/festival/imamat-day |title=Imamat Day Mubarak! |publisher=TheIsmaili.org |date=2009-07-11 |accessdate=2010-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aga Khan IV]] is the [[List of Ismaili imams|49th Imam]] of the Ismailis, having succeeded his grandfather, the [[Aga Khan III]] on July 11, 1957.&lt;ref name="IIS-Aga-Khan"&gt;{{cite web | title=Introduction to His Highness the Aga Khan | publisher=The Institute of Ismaili Studies | url=http://iis.ac.uk/view_article.asp?ContentID=103467 | date=2010-01-28 | accessdate=2010-07-05 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100503011914/http://iis.ac.uk/view_article.asp?ContentID=103467 | archivedate=2010-05-03 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His Imamat Day is therefore observed annually on July 11.

The recognition of the Imam of the Time is central to Ismailis' faith and belief.&lt;ref name="tio-imamat-day"/&gt; Imamat Day provides occasion to reinforce this and to express gratitude to the Imam who, in keeping with the centuries-old tradition of leadership, provides guidance in matters of faith, and works to improve the quality and security of their lives.&lt;ref name="tio-imamat-day"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IIS-Aga-Khan"/&gt; It is a day to reaffirm their spiritual allegiance to the Imam and renew their commitment to the ethics of their faith.&lt;ref name="tio-imamat-day"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25907">The '''Jan Wong controversy''' refers to a claim made by [[Jan Wong]] on September 16, 2006, three days after the [[Dawson College shooting|shooting at Dawson College]] in Montreal. Canada’s nationally distributed [[newspaper of record]], ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', published a front-page article titled, "Get under the desk,"&lt;ref name="Wong"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060915.wxshooting-main16/BNStory/National/ |title=Get under the desk |first=Jan |last=Wong |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=September 16, 2006 |accessdate=September 20, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Jan Wong]].&lt;ref name="vastel"&gt;"Le racisme sournois du Globe &amp; Mail" by Michel Vastel, Blog for ''L'actualité'', September 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the article, Ms. Wong controversially linked all three [[Quebec]] [[school shooting]]s of the last two decades—1989 [[École Polytechnique Massacre]] (15 deaths), 1992 [[Concordia University massacre|Concordia University Massacre]] (4 deaths), and 2006 [[Dawson College shooting|Dawson College Shooting]] (2 deaths)—to the purported [[social alienation|alienation]] brought about by "the decades-long linguistic struggle" within the province. Public outcry and political condemnation soon followed in many venues. In response, a ''Globe and Mail'' editorial attempted to minimize the controversy as a "small uproar" over journalistic freedom, but this caused further condemnation. Jan Wong maintained her perspective and wrote extensively about the whole experience in her book ''Out of the Blue, A Memoir of Workplace Depression, Recovery, Redemption and, Yes, Happiness''.&lt;ref name=janwong&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janwong.ca/outoftheblue.html |title=Jan Wong - Out of the Blue |publisher=Janwong.ca |date= |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Article ==
Wong suggested that the school shootings might have been related to the fact that the perpetrators were not old-stock French Québécois: ([[Marc Lépine]] was [[Algeria|half-Algerian]], [[Valery Fabrikant]] was a [[Russian Jews|Russian Jew]], and [[Kimveer Gill]] was of [[India]]n heritage); and they had been alienated by a Quebec society concerned with "racial purity." Citing the history of the use of the antiquated&lt;ref name="Charest"&gt;[http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=7e75959e-b11b-4a7f-865d-2ec86fc78f4d&amp;k=53879 "Charest seeks Globe apology over notion culture a factor in school shootings"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311075939/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=7e75959e-b11b-4a7f-865d-2ec86fc78f4d&amp;k=53879 |date=2007-03-11 }} by the Canadian Press, ''The Gazette'', September 19, 2006, retrieved September 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robitaille"&gt;"Les « pures laines » coupables ?" by Antoine Robitaille, ''La Presse'', September 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; term "[[pure laine]]," ("pure wool"), Wong postulated the existence of a uniquely Québécois brand of racism, writing: "Elsewhere, to talk of racial ‘purity’ is repugnant. Not in Quebec."

The article also portrayed school shootings in Canada as a Quebec phenomenon, citing Jan Bryan, columnist for the ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]'', saying, "Three doesn’t mean anything. But three out of three in Quebec means something." It also presented the Montreal anglophone community as a small-town, close-knit community.

== Public reaction ==
Hundreds of letters of complaints were received by ''The Globe and Mail''.&lt;ref name="GMEDITO"&gt;"Today’s Quebec", Editorial, ''The Globe and Mail'', September 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; As in [[Barbara Kay controversy|Barbara Kay's case]], the [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society]] (SSJB) lodged a complaint to the Quebec Press Council. SSJB president [[Jean Dorion]] declared "There is no obsession for racial purity in Quebec, definitely not.

== Journalistic reaction ==
A number of Quebec journalists denounced Wong's article. [[France|French-born]] journalist [[Michel Vastel]], in his blog for the news magazine ''[[L'actualité]]'', called the article "deceitful racism" and the interpretation "repugnant".&lt;ref name="vastel"/&gt; His opposition was advanced again in a following ''[[Le Journal de Québec|Journal de Québec]]'' piece by Vastel.&lt;ref&gt;"La semaine de toutes les hontes" by Michel Vastel, ''The Globe and Mail'', September 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Wong's article was condemned by [[Quebec federalist ideology|federalist]] ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' editorialist [[André Pratte]] (in a letter to the ''Globe''&lt;ref&gt;"’Pure laine’ is simply pure nonsense" by André Pratte, ''The Globe and Mail'', September 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''La Presse'' editorial),&lt;ref&gt;"Un journal national ?" by André Pratte, ''La Presse'', September 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; journalists [[Michel C.

Although the ''Gazette'' called it "nonsense" in an editorial,&lt;ref name="Gazette1stWongEditorial"&gt;"Nonsense about language", Editorial, ''The Gazette'', September 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; it found the reaction to be out of proportion, as did Lysiane Gagnon from ''La Presse'', who nonetheless called the theory "delirious".&lt;ref&gt;"L’exploitation d’une calomnie" by Lysiane Gagnon, ''La Presse'', September 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gazette'' journalist [[Don Macpherson (journalist)|Don Macpherson]] wrote: "By the standards of Wong’s article, one could just as easily blame the [three] shootings on federalism, since all three happened to occur while the Quebec Liberals were in power". He advanced that, on the contrary, the tragedy and the controversy around Wong's article had shown a remarkable unity between French and English-speaking Quebecers.&lt;ref&gt;"Tragedy brings us together", by [[Don Macpherson (journalist)|Don Macpherson]], ''The Gazette'', September 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Kay, author of the [[Barbara Kay controversy|"Quebecistan" controversy]], herself criticized Wong, calling the analysis "bullshit".&lt;ref name="Robitaille"/&gt; [[Jack Jedwab]], Executive Director of the Association for Canadian Studies in Montreal and former Executive Director of the Quebec Region of the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]], noted that the expression "pure laine" was "no longer quite common". He also called the analysis "nonsense".&lt;ref name="Robitaille"/&gt; ''The Globe and Mail'' remarked that "[i]n English Canada, unsurprisingly, the response has been considerably more muted".&lt;ref name="GMEDITO"/&gt; However, on September 28, 2006, [[Warren Kinsella]] wrote a harsh criticism of Wong's work in ''[[The National Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Jan Wong, disgrace to journalism" by Warren Kinsella, ''The National Post'', September 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsella was born in Montreal.

== Political reaction ==
Micheline Labelle, director of the ''Centre de recherche sur l’immigration, l’ethnicité et la citoyenneté'' (CRIEC, "Centre for research on immigration, ethnicity and citizenship") at the [[Université du Québec à Montréal]] stated that she saw in the arguments something akin to "neoracism", that is to say, a generalization of a cultural trait applied to a given population. "For less than that, minorities go to the courts", she said.&lt;ref name="Robitaille"/&gt;

On September 19, 2006, the [[Canadian Press]] reported that [[Quebec federalist ideology|federalist]] Premier of Quebec [[Jean Charest]] demanded an apology, calling the article a "disgrace". He sent an open letter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=7558331f-14b9-4b1a-bfc1-e5a68dbe3999&amp;k=47772 Open letter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023005926/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=7558331f-14b9-4b1a-bfc1-e5a68dbe3999&amp;k=47772 |date=2012-10-23 }} by Jean Charest, ''The Gazette'', September 19, 2006, retrieved September 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; to the ''Globe'' vigorously defending Quebec's society and its language protection.

{{cquote|In this kind of situation, anyone who ventures to put forward explanations or comparisons at the very least risks making a fool of himself. Jan Wong has certainly discredited herself with her gamble.&lt;br&gt;
I was shocked and disappointed by the narrow-minded analysis published in the Saturday, September 16 edition, in which Ms Wong sought to identify the affirmation of French culture in Québec as the deeper cause of the Dawson College shootings and the killings at the Polytechnique in 1989.&lt;br&gt;
Quebecers make up less than 3% of the North American population. Over the centuries, through the vicissitudes of history, we have managed to preserve our language and culture, and in so doing, cherished the highest democratic ideals. Every year, we welcome tens of thousands of individuals from the four corners of the earth, people who contribute to building a free society in Québec, a society that is proud of its difference. [...]&lt;br&gt;
Ms Wong’s article is a disgrace. It betrays an ignorance of Canadian values and a profound misunderstanding of Québec. She should have the decency to apologize to all Quebecers.|quote height in pixels|Jean Charest}}

[[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] Prime Minister of Canada [[Stephen Harper]] called Wong's argument "prejudiced", "absurd", "irresponsible" and "without foundation".{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} He sent the ''Globe'' a similar letter. "These actions (the killings) deserve our unqualified moral condemnation, not an excuse for printing prejudices masked in the language of social theory," Harper wrote.&lt;ref name="Harper"&gt;[http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/MediaNews/2006/09/21/1872721-cp.html "Harper takes Wong to task for column"]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Alexander Panetta, CNEWS, September 20, 2006, retrieved September 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parti Québécois]] leader [[André Boisclair]] declared that the journalist had, on the intellectual level, "slipped into the dregs" ("''glissé dans les bas fonds''").&lt;ref name="GMSRC"&gt;[http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/societe/2006/09/21/001-globe-excuse-non.shtml "Le Globe and Mail se défend"], Société Radio-Canada, retrieved September 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Former Premier of Quebec [[Bernard Landry]] declared to ''[[La Tribune]]'' "if she is of good faith, she will have to apologize [...] It is incredible that it is still possible today to convey such delirious opinions on Quebec. Especially in an era when Quebec is more cosmopolitan than ever. [...] It is insulting for Quebec and dishonouring for Canada.

[[Cameroon|Cameroon-born]] [[Bloc Québécois]] Member of Parliament [[Maka Kotto]] issued a declaration at the [[House of Commons of Canada]] stating "to pretend that there could be a link of any kind of cause-and-effect between the dramatic episode of Dawson College and Bill 101 — described as infamous by the journalist — pertains of a defamatory delirium disconnected from the Quebec reality. [...] Quebec is an inclusive, welcoming society where it is pleasant to live. As an immigrant, I felt very rapidly welcome there and I deplore that the openness of the Quebec people can be put into question." He invited the federal government to denounce the writings of Jan Wong as well.&lt;ref name="Kotto"&gt;"Charest exige des excuses du Globe and Mail" by Jocelyne Richer, Canadian Press, September 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 20 the House of Commons unanimously passed a motion requesting an apology "to the Quebec people" for the column.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberpresse.ca/article/20060920/CPACTUALITES/60920106/6128/CPSPECIAL12 "Harper dénonce à son tour le Globe and Mail"] by the Canadian Press, ''La Presse'', September 20, 2006, retrieved September 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denis Coderre]], the Liberal MP who tabled the motion, called the column "classless".&lt;ref name="CBC1"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/cp/media/060921/X092153U.html "One of Harper's own MPs made same comments PM dubbed prejudiced"] by Isabelle Rodrigue, Canadian Press, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, September 21, 2006, retrieved September 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; "People feel there's a sort [...] of trend.", he said. "I think that it's enough. We're not "Quebecistan", we're not a people that ostracizes, we're a model of integration."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radio-canada.ca/util/zapmedia/version10/WMleftframe.asp?directLink=http://www.radio-canada.ca/Medianet/2006/CBF/Radiojournal200609210800_2.asx&amp;promo=&amp;duree=court Radio report], Société Radio-Canada, retrieved September 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Coderre was in the group of politicians attacked by Barbara Kay in the [[Barbara Kay controversy|"Quebecistan" controversy]], also accused of "[[Quebec bashing]]". Marie-Hélène Paradis, press attaché of Quebec Minister of Immigration [[Lise Thériault]], said "No data can support what Ms. Wong advances." She declared that such allegations feed "the type of fast judgements that lead to discrimination."&lt;ref name="Robitaille"/&gt;

Despite having voted for the motion, Conservative Member of Parliament [[Daniel Petit]] declared that there might be a link, as Wong suggested. "I think that the billion (dollars) that we put in [the [[Canadian gun registry]] ] should have been put into education and integration of immigrants in Montreal", Petit said. Dimitri Soudas, press attaché for Conservative Prime Minister Harper, said "The comments of Mr. Petit are unacceptable, he should retract them and it does not reflect in any case the position of the government", adding that Petit was met by the Prime Minister's cabinet on the subject. MPs of the House of Commons criticized him for his statements, including [[Michel Gauthier]], of the Bloc Québécois, and [[Denis Coderre]], of the Liberal Party of Canada, who demanded apologies. He offered them promptly. "I made inappropriate remarks," Petit said in a statement. "I withdraw them entirely because you cannot draw any link between the integration of immigrants in Quebec and the terrible tragedy at Dawson College."&lt;ref name="CBC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Petit"&gt;[http://www.cyberpresse.ca/article/20060921/CPACTUALITES/60921157/6128/CPSPECIAL12 "Un député de Québec tient des propos semblables à ceux de Wong"] by the Canadian Press, ''La Presse'', September 21, 2006, retrieved September 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Globe and Mail editorial response ==
On September 21, 2006, ''The Globe and Mail'' published an editorial on the affair. Calling the controversy a "small uproar", it defended the right of the journalist to question such phenomena, the "need to ask hard questions and explore uncomfortable avenues", saying that it "merely wondered". The editor claimed not to be surprised by the hundreds of letters of protest received, including those of [[First Minister]]s Charest and Harper. The editorial validated Wong's claims of alienation in Quebec, which the ''Globe'' called "politics of exclusion". Asking whether this exclusion led to marginalization and perhaps alienation, it said that the answer is "arguable". However, it called the marginalization and alienation of the three shooters "obvious". About whether it could be associated with the murders, it answered that "[n]o such evidence exists".&lt;ref name="GMEDITO"/&gt; In a sentence apparently intended to balance the assertions, it implied at the same time that an even worse discrimination existed in the Quebec of the past, as it wrote: "By the same token, it would be remiss to forget that today’s Quebec is not the Quebec of yesteryear."&lt;ref name="GMEDITO"/&gt; ''The Globe and Mail'' did not issue an apology for Jan Wong's piece, as requested by many, including the unanimous House of Commons.

=== Reactions to the editorial ===
Leader of the Bloc Québécois [[Gilles Duceppe]] declared that he considered the editorial an attempt at justification.&lt;ref name="Petit"/&gt; "It even suggests there might be some problems in Quebec because of the language laws. It's unacceptable and it's deplorable and it's shameful for a newspaper of that stature", he said. "Try imagining the opposite — If I'd made such nonsensical, absurd remarks (about English Canada). Then all the editorial writers across Canada would get involved."&lt;ref name="CBC1"/&gt;  Premier of Quebec Jean Charest was said to be disappointed by ''The Globe and Mail'' response. He was also said to be offended by the little consideration the paper gave his open letter, that was published in the readers' opinion page (like the one from Prime Minister Harper). "The (House of Commons) motion is totally ignored", said the Premier's press attaché.&lt;ref&gt;"Déçu de la réponse du Globe and Mail" by Michel Corbeil, ''Le Soleil'', September 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 23, 2006, the [[Canadian Press]] reported that [[Edward Greenspon]], editor of ''The Globe and Mail'', expressed regrets. In a ''The Globe and Mail'' column, without making formal apologies, he wrote that the personal opinions of Wong should have been excised from the piece, not because they were unacceptable, but because they constituted a "thesis", not a "statement of fact". He wrote that "they should have been put into a separate piece clearly marked opinion". He however believed the reaction to be clearly disproportionate.&lt;ref&gt;"Le Globe and Mail exprime des regrets" by the Canadian Press, ''La Presse'', September 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Greenspon's insinuation that the piece was not "clearly marked opinion", it had in fact been accompanied by a headshot of Wong, the traditional means of designating opinion pieces.&lt;ref name="davidhayes.ca"/&gt;

== Jan Wong's response ==
Jan Wong declined the invitation of host [[Guy A. Lepage]] to explain herself at the popular Québécois talk show ''[[Tout le monde en parle (Quebec)|Tout le monde en parle]]''.&lt;ref name="GMSRC"/&gt; She has declared: "I brought forward a point of view [...] and I maintain it."&lt;ref&gt;''La Presse'', September 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; She has claimed that, during the controversy, she was the target of sexist and racist attacks, citing a ''Le Devoir'' cartoon that caricatured Wong with thick glasses and buck teeth opening a [[fortune cookie]] that said "Beware of Bill 101". The newspaper claimed that it was a reference to the [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese restaurant]]s of her well-known father, Bill Wong, not her ethnicity. Jan Wong wrote extensively about the whole experience in her book ''Out of the Blue, A Memoir of Workplace Depression, Recovery, Redemption and Yes, Happiness''.&lt;ref name="janwong"/&gt; In it, Jan Wong described in detail the backlash she received immediately after her article published, how the Globe and Mail management, in her view, abandoned her in front of the torrent of negative reactions from all sides, and how she spiraled down into depression.  She described when she found the ‘exact moment I began my descent into depression’ when she was shattered by racial attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/05/20/jan-wong-why-i-was-hated-in-quebec-and-abandoned-in-toronto/|title=Why I was hated in Quebec and abandoned in Toront|author=Wong, Jan|publisher=[[National Post]]|date=May 20, 2012|accessdate=May 24, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716040357/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/05/20/jan-wong-why-i-was-hated-in-quebec-and-abandoned-in-toronto/|archivedate=July 16, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book was self-published after [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], the publisher of her previous books, pulled out mere days before print although Doubleday denied any legal interference from ''The Globe''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gessell |first=Paul |title=Jan Wong's blues |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/entertainment/Wong+blues/6566814/story.html |accessdate=May 24, 2012 |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |date=May 4, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was released on May 5, 2012.&lt;ref name="janwong"/&gt;

'''Juneteenth''', also known as '''Juneteenth Independence Day''' or '''Freedom Day,''' is an American holiday that commemorates the June 19, 1865, announcement of the [[Emancipation Proclamation|abolition]] of [[slavery]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]], and more generally the emancipation of [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved African Americans]] throughout the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] of the [[southern United States]]. Its name is a [[portmanteau]] of "June" and "nineteenth", the date of its celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.blackvoicenews.com/news/46366-juneteenth-celebrated-in-coachella.html |title=Juneteenth Celebrated in Coachella |date=June 22, 2011 |work=Black Voice News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122071819/http://www.blackvoicenews.com/news/46366-juneteenth-celebrated-in-coachella.html |archivedate=January 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/juneteenth|title=Juneteenth|work=Merriam Webster Dictionary|accessdate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juneteenth is recognized as a state holiday or special day of observance in forty-five states.&lt;ref name="Urban"&gt; {{Cite web|url=https://urbanfaith.com/2016/06/national-observance-juneteenth-still-struggle.html|title=National Observance of Juneteenth is Still a Struggle |accessdate=June 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today it is observed primarily in local celebrations. Traditions include public readings of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], singing traditional songs such as "[[Swing Low, Sweet Chariot]]" and "[[Lift Every Voice and Sing]]", and reading of works by noted [[African Americans|African-American]] writers such as [[Ralph Ellison]] and [[Maya Angelou]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 2002. pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrations may include rodeos, street fairs, cookouts, family reunions, park parties, [[historical reenactment]]s, or [[beauty pageant|Miss Juneteenth contests]].&lt;ref name="celeb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.juneteenth.com/howtocelebrate.htm |title=How to Celebrate |website=Juneteenth.com |accessdate=June 19, 2014}}{{Self-published source|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mascogos]], descendants of [[Black Seminoles]], of [[Coahuila]], [[Mexico]] also celebrate Juneteenth.&lt;ref name="El Universal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mascogos.

==History==
[[File:Ashton Villa Galveston Texas.jpg|thumb|[[Ashton Villa]], from whose front balcony General Order #3 was read on June 19, 1865]]
During the [[American Civil War]], President [[Abraham Lincoln]] issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] on September 22, 1862, with an effective date of January 1, 1863. It declared that all enslaved persons in the [[Confederate States of America]] in rebellion and not in Union hands were to be freed. This excluded the five states known later as [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]], which were the four "slave states" not in rebellion—Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware, and Missouri—and those counties of Virginia soon to form the state of West [[Virginia]], and also the three zones under Union occupation: the state of [[Tennessee]], lower [[Louisiana]], and Southeast Virginia.

More isolated geographically, Texas was not a battleground, and thus the people held there as slaves were not affected by the Emancipation Proclamation unless they escaped.&lt;ref name="cruz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1815936,00.html|title=A Brief History of Juneteenth|date=June 18, 2008 |first=Gilbert |last=Cruz|work=Time magazine|accessdate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planters and other slaveholders had migrated into Texas from eastern states to escape the fighting, and many brought enslaved people with them, increasing by the thousands the enslaved population in the state at the end of the Civil War.&lt;ref name="gates"/&gt;
Although most enslaved people lived in rural areas, more than 1000 resided in both [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] and [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] by 1860, with several hundred in other large towns.&lt;ref name=barr24&gt;Barr (1996), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1865, there were an estimated 250,000 enslaved people in Texas.&lt;ref name="gates"/&gt;  The older, and [[Hispanic America|Hispanic]], town of [[San Antonio]] had 168 among a population of 3,436.&lt;ref name=barr24&gt;Barr (1996), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The news of General [[Robert E. Lee|Robert E. Lee's]] [[Battle of Appomattox Court House#Surrender|surrender]] on April 9 reached Texas later in the month.&lt;ref&gt;The Texas Republican (Marshall), Apr. 28, 1865, p. 2, contains a reference to the surrender&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Army of the Trans-Mississippi]] did not surrender until June 2.&lt;ref name="gates"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/what-is-juneteenth/ |first=Henry Louis, Jr. |last=Gates |title=What Is Juneteenth? |agency=Originally posted on ''The Root'' |website=The African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 18, [[Union Army]] General [[Gordon Granger]] arrived at [[Galveston Island]] with 2,000 federal troops to occupy Texas on behalf of the federal government.&lt;ref name="cruz" /&gt; The following day, standing on the balcony of Galveston's [[Ashton Villa]], Granger read aloud the contents of "General Order No. 3", announcing the total [[emancipation]] of those held as slaves:
{{quote|The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.&lt;ref name = "TXJ19"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

[[File:Emancipation Day in Richmond, Virginia, 1905.jpg|thumb|Emancipation Day celebration in Richmond, Virginia in 1905]]
Formerly enslaved people in Galveston rejoiced in the streets after the announcement, although in the years afterward many struggled to work through the changes against resistance of whites. The following year, [[Freedman|freedmen]] organized the first of what became the annual celebration of Juneteenth in Texas.&lt;ref name = "TXJ19"/&gt; In some cities African-Americans were barred from using public parks because of state-sponsored [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] of facilities. Across parts of Texas, freed people pooled their funds to purchase land to hold their celebrations, such as [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]'s [[Third Ward, Houston#Parks and recreation|Emancipation Park]], [[Mexia, Texas|Mexia]]'s Booker T. Washington Park, and Emancipation Park in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].&lt;ref name="gates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TXJ19"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ref/abouttx/juneteenth.html |title= Juneteenth |website=Texas State Library and Archives Commission |accessdate=July 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the date is sometimes referred to as the "traditional end of slavery in Texas" it was given legal status in a series of [[Texas Supreme Court]] decisions between 1868 and 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Randolph|title=The End of Slavery in Texas: A Research Note|journal=Southwestern Historical Quarterly|date=1984|volume=88|issue=1|pages=71–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, economic and political forces led to a decline in Juneteenth celebrations. From 1890 to 1908, Texas and all former Confederate states passed new constitutions or amendments that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised black people]], excluding them from the political process. White-dominated state legislatures passed [[Jim Crow|Jim Crow laws]] imposing second-class status. The [[Great Depression]] forced many black people off farms and into the cities to find work. In these urban environments, African Americans had difficulty taking the day off to celebrate. The [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]] began during [[World War II]], when many black people migrated to the West Coast where skilled jobs in the defense industry were opening up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nFTlBHBFYvEC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=west+coast+defense+%22great+migration%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP7fj7zqjZAhVBC8AKHWKeAMAQ6AEIQzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=west%20coast%20defense%20%22great%20migration%22&amp;f=false|title=Way Up North in Louisville: African American Migration in the Urban South, 1930-1970|last=Adams|first=Luther|date=November 29, 2010|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=9780807899434|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1940 through 1970, in the second wave of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], more than 5 million black people left Texas, Louisiana and other parts of the South for the North and West Coast. As historian [[Isabel Wilkerson]] writes, "The people from Texas took Juneteenth Day to [[Los Angeles]], [[Oakland]], [[Seattle]], and other places they went."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Isabel |last=Wilkerson |title=The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration |url={{google books|Y03WKII5m7QC|plainurl=yes}} |location=New York |publisher=Random House |date=2010 |accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1950s and 1960s, the [[Civil Rights Movement]] focused the attention of African-American youth on the struggle for racial equality and the future, but many linked these struggles to the historical struggles of their ancestors. Following the 1968 [[Poor People's Campaign]] to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] called by [[Ralph Abernathy|Rev. Ralph Abernathy]], many attendees returned home and initiated Juneteenth celebrations in areas where the day was not previously celebrated.

Since the 1980s and 1990s, the holiday has been more widely celebrated among African-American communities. In 1994 a group of community leaders gathered at Christian Unity Baptist Church in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] to work for greater national celebration of Juneteenth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsone.com/2021601/juneteenth-history |title=Juneteenth: Celebrating The Early Moments Of Freedom Today |publisher=News One |date=June 19, 2012 |accessdate=June 19, 2014 |last=Chandler |first=D.L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expatriates have celebrated it in cities abroad, such as Paris.&lt;ref name="moskin2004"/&gt; Some US military bases in other countries sponsor celebrations, in addition to those of private groups.&lt;ref name="moskin2004"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/18/national/18june.html |title=An Obscure Texas Celebration Makes Its Way Across the U.S.| last=Moskin |first=Julie |work= The New York Times |date=June 18, 2004 | accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jtcom02"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.juneteenth.com/international.htm |title=The World Celebrates Freedom |website=Juneteenth.com |accessdate=June 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the holiday is still mostly unknown outside African-American communities, it has gained mainstream awareness through depictions in entertainment media, such as episodes of TV series ''[[Atlanta_(TV_series)#ep9|Atlanta]]'' (2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ho |first1=Rodney |title=FX's 'Atlanta' recap ('Juneteenth'): season 1, episode 9 |url=https://www.ajc.com/blog/radiotvtalk/atlanta-recap-juneteenth-season-episode/tM9R8tdDj9LKUIch1YVbPJ/ |accessdate= June 18, 2018 |publisher=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date= October 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Black-ish_(season_4)#Episodes|Black-ish]]'' (2017),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Framke |first1=Caroline |title=Black-ish’s musical episode about Juneteenth is a pointed lesson on American ignorance |url=https://www.vox.com/fall-tv/2017/10/4/16418774/blackish-juneteenth-episode-season-3-premiere-recap |accessdate=June 18, 2018 |publisher=Vox |date= October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter of which featured musical numbers about the holiday by [[Aloe Blacc]], [[The Roots]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="I Am A Slave" |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=68&amp;v=M_FP7x322cc |website=YouTube |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fonzworth Bentley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="We Built This" |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzaUTbnh_CQ |website=YouTube |publisher=ABC Television Network |accessdate=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Butler |first1=Berhonie |title=‘Blackish’ gives a powerful history lesson — with nods to ‘Hamilton’ and ‘Schoolhouse Rock’ |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/10/04/blackish-gives-a-powerful-history-lesson-with-nods-to-hamilton-and-schoolhouse-rock/ |accessdate=June 18, 2018 |publisher=Washington Post |date= October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official status==
In 1980, Texas was the first state to establish Juneteenth as a state holiday under legislation introduced by freshman [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Texas House of Representatives|state representative]] [[Al Edwards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/independence-day/page/0/1 |first= Anne |last=Dingus| title=Once a Texas-only holiday marking the end of slavery, Juneteenth is now celebrated nationwide with high spirits and hot barbecue| date= June 2001 |work=[[Texas Monthly]] |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juneteenth is a "partial staffing" holiday in Texas; government offices do not close but agencies may operate with reduced staff, and employees may either celebrate this holiday or substitute it with one of four "optional holidays" recognized by Texas.

By 2008, nearly half of US states observed the holiday as a ceremonial observance.&lt;ref name="cruz"/&gt; As of 2014, 43 of the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have recognized Juneteenth as either a state holiday or ceremonial holiday, a day of observance.&lt;ref name="Maryland"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationaljuneteenth.com/Maryland.html|title=Maryland|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; States that do not recognize it are Hawaii, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://baltimoretimes-online.com/news/2014/may/30/juneteenth-officially-recognized-maryland/ |first=Stacy M. |last=Brown |title=Juneteenth officially recognized in Maryland |work=Baltimore Times |date=May 30, 2014 |accessdate=October 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/apxnew-hampshire-governor-recognizes-juneteenth-day/|title=New Hampshire governor recognizes Juneteenth day|date=June 19, 2018|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=June 19, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 the first legislation to recognize "Juneteenth Independence Day" was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, H.J. Res. 195, sponsored by [[Barbara-Rose Collins]] (D-MI). In 1997 Congress recognized the day through Senate Joint Resolution 11 and House Joint Resolution 56. In 2013 the U.S. Senate passed Senate Resolution 175, acknowledging Lula Briggs Galloway (late president of the National Association of Juneteenth Lineage) who "successfully worked to bring national recognition to Juneteenth Independence Day", and the continued leadership of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation.&lt;ref name="sr175"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-resolution/175/text |title=S.Res.175 - A resolution observing Juneteenth Independence Day, June 19, 1865, the day on which slavery finally came to an end in the United States |website=United States Congress |date=June 19, 2013 |accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] added Juneteenth to its calendars in [[iOS]] under official US holidays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2018/02/16/apples-ical-calendar-mysteriously-deletes-easter.html |first=Chris |last=Ciaccia|title=Apple's iCal calendar mysteriously deletes Easter|publisher=Fox News|date=February 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations such as the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation are seeking a Congressional designation of Juneteenth as a national day of observance.&lt;ref name="gates" /&gt;

[[File:UlrikaBidegård.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Ulrika Bidegård in 2007.]]
The '''kidnapping of Ulrika Bidegård''', a member of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] national [[show jumping]] team, took place on 20 January 1993 in front of her family's home in [[Sint-Genesius-Rode]], [[Belgium]]. Cash withdrawals made with her credit card led the police to the kidnapper, a man living in a downtown [[Brussels]] apartment, where Bidegård was kept captive. The man was arrested, and his victim rescued, after over four days of a captivity that made headlines in both Sweden and Belgium.

Tried in 1995, the kidnapper was sentenced to fifteen years of penal labour. Lars Nilsson, a Swede in his thirties, had no prior convictions and was unanimously described by his family and friends as a kind and socially active person.

== Background ==

Born on 9 September 1964,&lt;ref group=nt&gt;The date of birth comes from the Swedish Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt; Ulrika Bidegård grew up in [[Onsala]], outside [[Göteborg]] in Western [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=jb&gt;{{sv}} Joakim Björck. [http://hd.se/mer/2008/01/27/ibland-paaminns-hon-om-dramat-som/ ''Ibland påminns hon om dramat som kunde kostat henne livet''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912005030/http://hd.se/mer/2008/01/27/ibland-paaminns-hon-om-dramat-som/ |date=2013-09-12 }}. Helsingborgs Dagblad. 27 janvier 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; She is the daughter of Kennet Bidegård, a well-off businessman,&lt;ref group=sr&gt;03:12 - 03:27 : ''Ulrikas pappa, Kennet...''&lt;/ref&gt; and of his wife Lena, a former Swedish Olympic gymnast.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;05:50 - 06:01 : ''Ulrikas mamma, Lena...''&lt;/ref&gt; She started [[Equestrianism|riding]] rather late in life, at the age of eleven, but quickly developed the skills of a champion.&lt;ref name=jb/&gt; At twenty-three, she moved to [[Belgium]] to train with "[[Brazil]]ian wizard" [[Nelson Pessoa]].&lt;ref group=sr&gt;04:04 - 04:29 : ''Ulrika är tjugotre...''&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to her resulting improvement, she was able to join the Swedish [[show jumping]] team. She took part in the [[European Show Jumping Championships]] and was to compete in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], but eventually missed the competition after her horse Masada sustained an injury.&lt;ref name=jb/&gt;

Meanwhile, Bidegård's parents had joined her in Belgium in order to take advantage, as many Swedes did in the late 1980s, of the favourable tax laws.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;05:14 - 05:49 : ''Vid den här tiden...''&lt;/ref&gt; They settled in the "Swedish colony" of [[Sint-Genesius-Rode]] near Brussels where they bought a house. As they found the Belgian interior design style unappealing, and did not speak the local language, they had their new home renovated by a Swedish contractor. Ulrika then moved in with them.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;07:28 - 11:06 : ''Lena och Kennet köper...''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kidnapping ==

In the evening of Wednesday 20 January 1993, Ulrika Bidegård drove back home toward Sint-Genesius-Rode, after she spent the day training. Her parents were in Sweden, and the villa was empty.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;12:48 - 13:41 : ''De första veckorna...''&lt;/ref&gt; As she parked her car in front of the family house, a man wearing a mask showed up and threatened her with a firearm. Tied up and gagged, she was driven to her kidnapper's apartment in central Brussels. There she was placed in sitting position in a wooden box where she was kept during her whole captivity. Her kidnapper fed her sparingly and gave her water to drink laced with sedative.&lt;ref name=jb/&gt;

The man called Bidegård's father for the first time at his office in Göteborg. He demanded in English that neither the police nor the media be alerted, and did not talk of any ransom.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;18:14 - 19:07 : ''Först ett halvt dygn...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=sr&gt;22:46 - 23:01 : ''Mannen som ringer...''&lt;/ref&gt; Kennet Bidegård immediately contacted a prosecutor, who alerted [[Interpol]].&lt;ref group=sr&gt;24:30 - 24:47 : ''Och då ringde vi...''&lt;/ref&gt; When Bidegård's parents landed at Brussels airport, they were greeted by the Belgian police who had established a special task force.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;25:17 - 26:51 : ''Samtalen flyger mellan...''&lt;/ref&gt; The story was quickly leaked to the press by an interpreter, and it made headlines in both Belgium and Sweden.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;29:32 - 31:52 : ''Polisen upprepar om...''&lt;/ref&gt;

Because he had used a public phone booth to make calls to Sweden, the police knew that the kidnapper was located in downtown Brussels,&lt;ref group=sr&gt;38:36 - 39:00 : ''Det enda polisen vet...''&lt;/ref&gt; but it was cash withdrawals made with Bidegård's credit card that led them to the man on Saturday 23 January. They followed him, and he led them to his apartment.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;45:01 - 46:38 : ''Men senare på lördagen...''&lt;/ref&gt; As they did not know where Ulrika was located, at first they simply put the place under surveillance: an untimely arrest could set Bidegård's life at risk.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;49:28 - 50:24 : ''Men även om de har...''&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, a photograph of the kidnapper was shown to Bidegård's parents, who immediately recognised him: he was Lars Nilsson,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/kidnapped-showjumper-is-rescued-from-ordeal-in-refrigeration-container-1.775291 ''Kidnapped show jumper is freed'']  HeraldScotland 26 Jan 1993&lt;/ref&gt; a carpenter from Sweden, who had been part of the team that had worked on renovating the family house.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;47:29 - 48:18 : ''Samtidigt som spanningspolis...''&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the constant surveillance of the kidnapper's apartment from a neighbouring building, the police were unable to determine whether Bidegård was held captive there.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;53:37 - 54:01 : ''Poliserna har installerat...''&lt;/ref&gt; They finally decided to assault the apartment during the early hours of Monday, expecting to take the kidnapper by surprise. It was 2.30 am on the morning of 25 January when police forces stormed the apartment. Bidegård recovered her freedom after more than four days of captivity, and her kidnapper was arrested.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;54:40 - 57:06 : ''Så då bestämde vi...''&lt;/ref&gt;

On Tuesday 26 January, a letter arrived at the Bidegård's home in Sint-Genesius-Rode. It enclosed a photograph of Ulrika, tied up in her wooden box, along with a laconic demand for ransom: "500000 USD WEDNESDAY". This letter had been posted by the kidnapper on the Friday night.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;33:39 - 34:05 : ''Kidnapparen tar bilden...''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial ==

As the kidnapping took place in Brussels the inquiry was led by the Belgian police, but the Swedish police were asked to look into the background of the accused. When interrogated, relatives and friends depicted a kind, hard-working and socially healthy individual, with no predisposition to commit such a crime.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;64:48 - 66:26 : ''Nu är det upp till...''&lt;/ref&gt; For the Bidegård's themselves, the shock and consternation were enormous, as they had had excellent relations with the carpenter while he was working at their home.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;48:10 - 49:09 : ''Man blev ju klart chockad...''&lt;/ref&gt;

The judicial inquiry concluded that the motive was purely financial: despite the quality of his work, the man was deeply in debt because of his bad debtors, and had been forced to pledge his parents' house. To get out of his predicament, he resorted to kidnapping the daughter of one of his rich clients.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;66:27 - 68:15 : ''...var en jätteduktig snickare...''&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial opened in Brussels on 2 May 1995.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;73:34 - 73:40 : ''Karl-Arne Ockell var...''&lt;/ref&gt; The accused kept a low profile, and apologised to the Bidegård family.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;75:11 - 75:20 : ''Jag vill be hela familjen...''&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 May, he was sentenced to fifteen years of penal labour.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;77:10 - 77:46 : ''Den tionde maj 1995...''&lt;/ref&gt; He spent four years behind bars in Belgium before being transferred to Sweden, where he finished serving his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{sv}} Kjell Rynhag. [http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/9803/12/telegram/inrikes26.html ''Ulrika Bidegårds kidnappare får inte nåd'']. Aftonbladet. 12 mars 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; He was an exemplary inmate, and became a model of prisoner rehabilitation.&lt;ref group=sr&gt;78:11 - 79:34 : ''Men man upptäckte...''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epilogue ==

The kidnapping had both negative and positive impacts on Ulrika Bidegård's life. Unable to cope with the media pressure she put an end to her career as a top-level rider, although she remained active in the field. She became close to one of the Belgian policemen who had taken part in her release, and the two eventually married on 13 August 1994. The wedding was largely covered by the Swedish press. They have had two children.&lt;ref name=jb/&gt;&lt;ref group=sr&gt;72:17 - 72:36 : ''När vi gifte oss så...''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Ulrika Bidegård was back in [[Onsala]], at the head of a riding school where she was training young riders.&lt;ref name=jb/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1387">The '''London Fringe Theatre Festival''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] annual [[fringe theatre]] and related arts [[arts festival|festival]] in [[London, Ontario]].  It is credited with triggering a resurgence in local playwriting&lt;ref&gt;http://theatreinlondon.ca/2002/11/a-remarkable-year-for-original-scripts-by-londoners/&lt;/ref&gt; and performance after the University of Western Ontario cancelled its drama program.

The first festival was presented in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20000904163425/http://www.londonfringe.on.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; comprising 28 local, national, and international productions.  The festival currently runs for ten days near the beginning of June.  Prior to 2009 it began on the [[Ontario|province]]'s [[Simcoe Day|Civic holiday]] weekend, but was moved that year to take advantage of the east-to-west circuit of the [[Canadian Association of Fringe Festivals]].

The London Fringe Festival organization also sponsors and supports theatre- and arts-related events throughout the year, including a [[Nuit Blanche]] event and The Lost Soul Stroll, a historical [[:Category:Ghost tours|ghost tour]].

The '''London Pavilion''' is a building on the corner of [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] and [[Coventry Street]] on the north-east side of [[Piccadilly Circus]] in London. It is currently a shopping arcade and part of the [[Trocadero (London)|Trocadero Centre]].

==Early history==
The first building bearing the name, a [[music hall]] formed from roofing the yard of the Black Horse Inn, was built in 1859 for [[Emil Loibl]] and [[Charles Sonnhammer]]. A gallery was constructed for the hall but it could not utilise the full width, because one part of the premises was used by Dr Kahn's "Delectable Museum of Anatomy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/PavilionFiles/OldPav.htm ''The Old Pavilion''] (Arthur Lloyd). The site includes a photograph of the premises. Accessed 25 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Interior of newly opened London Pavilion Music Hall 1861.jpg|thumbnail|Interior of the newly opened London Pavilion Music Hall, 1861. Sonnhammer and Loibl are probably the figures in top hats at the front.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museumoflondonprints.com/image/440434/unknown-interior-of-newly-opened-london-pavilion-music-hall-1861&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1885 Shaftesbury Avenue was built through part of the site, and a new London Pavilion Theatre was constructed. This opened on 30 November 1885 with a popular revue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://footlightnotes.tripod.com/20060722home.html ''The Entr'acte, London''], Saturday, 5 December 1885, p.6a (Footlight Notes). accessed 13 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The new theatre was the first 'music hall deluxe', with [[marble]]-topped tables for dining in the auditorium. According to Charles Stuart and A. J. Park in ''The Variety Stage'' (1895) the rebuilding signalled a new era of [[variety theatre]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Hitherto the halls had borne unmistakable evidence of their origins, but the last vestiges of their old connections were now thrown aside, and they emerged in all the splendour of their new-born glory. The highest efforts of the architect, the designer and the decorator were enlisted in their service, and the gaudy and tawdry music hall of the past gave way to the resplendent 'theatre of varieties' of the present day, with its classic exterior of marble and freestone, its lavishly appointed auditorium and its elegant and luxurious foyers and promenades brilliantly illuminated by myriad electric lights&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Twentieth century==
The success of the venture led its owner, Villiers, to form a limited company; this became the first combine of music halls, Syndicate Halls Ltd. [[Lupino Lane]] made his London début here in 1903, as "Nipper Lane".&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Biography'' "Lupino Lane"&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1912 and 1936 the theatre presented a regular programme of musicals; these included [[Noël Coward]]'s first success, ''On With the Dance'' in April 1925. There were appearances by Sir [[Harry Lauder]]; in October 1921 the American actor and vocalist [[Clifton Webb]] appeared here in ''Fun of the Fayre'' and again in October the following year as Phidas in ''Phi-Phi''. In 1923 electric billboards were erected for the first time on the side of the building.&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41455 "Shaftesbury Avenue", ''Survey of London'': volumes 31 and 32: St James Westminster, Part 2] (1963), pp. 68–84 accessed 13 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LondonPavilion1964.jpg|thumb|London Pavilion Theatre showing ''A Hard Day's Night'' in 1964]]
In 1934 the building underwent significant structural alteration, and was converted into a cinema at a cost of £70,000 by F. G. M. Chancellor, of [[Frank Matcham]] and Co.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; It was the venue for the première of many films including ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'' in May 1957 for which the foyer was revamped to look like Frankenstein's laboratory, complete with the Monster in a tank.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair McKay (2007) ''A Thing of Unspeakable Horror: The History of Hammer Films'': 35&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1962 it premiered ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', the first [[James Bond in film|James Bond film]], and in July 1964 was the venue for the premiere of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''. In 1986 the Pavilion closed its doors forever as a theatre. The interior of the building was gutted and converted into a shopping arcade, preserving only the 1885 façade and the outer walls and roof. A wax figure exhibition opened in the building that same year, run by the [[Madame Tussauds]] Group, called ''[[Rock Circus]]''. The exhibition consisted of waxworks of famous rock and pop musicians. The ''Rock Circus'' exhibition closed in September 2001.

==Twenty-first century==
In 2000 the building became part of the [[Trocadero (London)|Trocadero Centre]], and signage on the building was altered in 2003 to read '''London Trocadero'''.

The basement of the building connects with [[Piccadilly Circus tube station]] and the rest of the Trocadero Centre.

The London Pavilion housed [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]], a visitor attraction dedicated to the weird, the unusual and the unbelievable, which was open from August 2008 until September 25th 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3244">The '''Lyceum Music Festival''', founded in 2008, is an orchestra festival presented in collaboration with the [[Utah Symphony Orchestra|Utah Symphony’s]] [[Deer Valley Music Festival]] located in just outside [[Zion National Park]] at Zion Ponderosa Ranch.  LMF provides mentoring for musicians ages 14 to 21 and presents a series of concerts.

The Festival was founded by Kayson Brown as an effort to connect young musicians with professional performers. With the cooperation of the [[Utah Symphony Orchestra|Utah Symphony]] and support from sponsoring organization [[American Heritage School (American Fork, Utah)|American Heritage School]], Lyceum Music Festival grew from a half-week day camp to a week-long festival with lodging. In 2012, the orchestra performed "Beethoven's 5 Secrets" with [[The Piano Guys]] on YouTube which had received 2 million hits within 2 months of its release. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_fkw5j-t0 Beethoven's 5 Secrets - OneRepublic (Cello/Orchestral Cover) - The Piano Guys]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program==
Students perform alongside renowned recording artists in chamber and symphonic concerts at the conclusion of the week. These concerts, presented at the OC Tanner Amphitheater and are open to the public. Approximately 100 students from across the United States participate.

For participants, the festival provides insights into classical music careers while helping students to acquire the skills necessary to performing at the professional level. Students prepare a professional level concert that features renowned guest artists. Those preparations include instrument specific training with Utah Symphony musicians, chamber music coaching with emerging professional string quartets, and working closely with professional conductors and guest artists in daily rehearsals. Recreation, leadership training, and entertainment activities are likewise an important element of the Festival.

==Guest artists==
Guest artists include Billboard-topping recording artists and award-winning faculty from professional symphony orchestras. Simply Three, The Piano Guys (four times), Igor and Vesna Gruppman, Nathan Pacheco, [[The 5 Browns]], [[Jenny Oaks Baker]], [[Steven sharp nelson|Steven Sharp Nelson]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110524070020/http://www.lyceummusicfestival.com/FG-DC.htm David Cho], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110524083558/http://www.lyceummusicfestival.com/FG-KB.htm Kayson Brown], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110524083603/http://www.lyceummusicfestival.com/FG-MSQ.htm Muir String Quartet], [[Keith Lockhart]], and [[David Lockington]].

[[File:Marco Bragadino.jpg|thumb|200px|Bragadino's portrait]]
'''Marco Bragadino''' or''' Marco Bragadini''' (c. 1545 &amp;ndash; 26 April 1591) was a [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Confidence trick|confidence man]] who claimed to be an [[alchemist]]. His name at birth is said to have been '''Mamugna''' but he impersonated the son of the dead military officer [[Marco Antonio Bragadin]].&lt;ref name=mamu&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fwwuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA390&amp;lpg=PA390&amp;dq=venice+gold+alchemy+antonio+bragadino&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NG8OhGiCBM&amp;sig=LJbZvjbVzFT-zcHdamomilRNMXY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rlhdTKSxBYWdlgfCrv2ZCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The living age, Volume 51 By Eliakim Littell, Robert S. Littell, Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  He convinced the government of Venice to finance his research into producing gold from base metals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mises.org/daily/4536  Ten Economic Blunders from History, #6. The Gold Factory of Venice]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Almost nothing is known about Bragadino's childhood and youth. After the conquest of Cyprus by the [[Ottoman empire]], his family presumably left the island for Venice like many other Christians. He claimed to be an illegitimate son of Venetian ''[[condottiero]]'' Marco Antonio Bragadin, murdered by the Turks after the [[siege of Famagusta]].&lt;ref name=mamu/&gt; In Venice, Bragadino is thought to have met [[Girolamo Scotto|Hieronymus Scotus]], from whom he learned the secrets of [[alchemy]] and the tricks of pretending to make gold.

===Journeyman in Italy===
It is unknown why Bragadino had to leave Venice but from 1574 to 1579 he stayed in [[Florence]] and was in contact with Grand Duchess [[Bianca Cappello]] whom he promised to heal from infertility with the [[philosopher's stone]]. This business may explain the high amount of money (Minucci writes of at least 40,000 [[Italian scudo|scudi]]){{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} that Bragadino was able to spend for a while. Later, Bragadino had to escape his creditors though and moved to [[Rome]] where he became a monk in a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] monastery. He received the minor consecrations and also a higher one, becoming [[Subdeacon]]. In 1588 he left the cloister without permission and returned to his errant life. He is reported to have visited [[Geneva]], [[England]] and [[France]]. As he returned to Italy he had to face the [[Inquisition]] who pursued the renegade monk. To protect himself, Bragadino made numerous influential friends with his gold making alchemy. The most prominent of them was the [[Duke of Mantua]], who paid 25,000 scudi to him.

===Venice===
The Republic of Venice invited its former citizen as an official guest to profit from his abilities. On 26 November 1589 Bragadino entered the city as a celebrated alchemist. But because he was not able to "create" any noteworthy amounts of money he escaped Venice in April 1590, heading for [[Padua]].

===Bavaria===
In Padua he was called upon by [[William V, Duke of Bavaria]]. In August 1590, Bragadino arrived at the Duke's court on [[Trausnitz Castle]] in [[Landshut]]. He quickly gained the Duke's trust, not only by promising to make copious amounts of gold to erase the Duke's debts, but also by offering to cure the Duke's severe headache. Moreover, he tried to receive a [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] of his priestly consecration from the Pope, using the Duke's envoys, but in vain.

By order of the Duke, Bragadino was executed by beheading on 26 April 1591 in Munich's ''Weinmarkt'' square. The act turned into a disaster as the executioner had to use three strikes with the sword until Bragadino's head was eventually cut off.

==Legacy==
His role as a colourful figure in the history of alchemism is still remembered today in the carnival lecture of the Institute of Anorganic Chemistry at the [[Technical University Munich]].

His adventurous life provides input for thematic conducted tours in Munich and Landshut.

A '''masquerade ball''' (or ''bal masqué'') is an event in which the participants attend in [[costume]] wearing a [[mask]]. (Compare the word "[[masque]]"—a formal written and sung court pageant.) Less formal "[[costume party|costume parties]]" may be a descendant of this tradition. A masquerade ball usually encompasses music and dancing. These nighttime events are used for entertainment and celebrations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.avasflowers.net/the-history-of-masquerade-balls|title=The History of Masquerade Balls {{!}} Avas Flowers|website=www.avasflowers.net|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

== History ==
{{Costume}}
Masquerade balls were a feature of the [[Carnival]] season in the 15th century, and involved increasingly elaborate allegorical [[Royal Entry|Royal Entries]], pageants, and triumphal processions celebrating marriages and other dynastic events of late medieval court life. The "[[Bal des Ardents]]" (''"Burning Men's Ball"'') was held by Charles VI of France, and intended as a ''Bal des sauvages'' (''"Wild Men's Ball"''), a form of costumed ball (''[[morisco]]''). It took place in celebration of the marriage of a [[lady-in-waiting]] of [[Charles VI of France]]'s queen in Paris on January 28, 1393. The King and five courtiers dressed as wildmen of the woods ([[woodwose]]s), with costumes of [[flax]] and [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]]. When they came too close to a torch, the dancers caught fire. (This episode may have influenced [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s short story "[[Hop-Frog]]".) Such costumed dances were a special luxury of the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Ducal Court of Burgundy]].

Masquerade balls were extended into costumed public festivities in Italy during the 16th century Renaissance (Italian, ''maschera''). They were generally elaborate dances held for members of the upper classes, and were particularly popular in [[Venice]]. They have been associated with the tradition of the [[Carnival of Venice|Venetian Carnival]]. With the fall of the Venetian Republic at the end of the 18th century, the use and tradition of masks gradually began to decline, until they disappeared altogether.
[[Image:Masquerade ball at Château de Hattonchâtel, France 2008.jpg|275px|right|thumb|Masquerade ball at [[Château de Hattonchâtel]], [[France]].]]

They became popular throughout mainland Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, sometimes with fatal results. [[Gustav III of Sweden]] was assassinated at a masquerade ball by disgruntled nobleman [[Jacob Johan Anckarström]], an event which [[Eugène Scribe]] and [[Daniel Auber]] turned into the opera ''[[Gustave III (opera)|Gustave III]]''.  The same event was the basis of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Un ballo in maschera|A Masked Ball]]'', although the censors in the original production forced him to portray it as a fictional story set in Boston. Most masks came from countries like Switzerland and Italy.

[[John James Heidegger]], a Swiss count who arrived in Italy in 1708, is credited with introducing to London the Venetian fashion of a semi-public masquerade ball, to which one might subscribe, with the first being held at [[Haymarket Theatre|Haymarket Opera House]].&lt;ref&gt;Aileen Ribeiro, "The exotic diversion: the dress worn at masquerades in eighteenth-century London", ''The Connoisseur'' '''197''' (January 1978:3-13.&lt;/ref&gt; London's public gardens, like [[Vauxhall Gardens]], refurbished in 1732, and [[Ranelagh Gardens]], provided optimal outdoor settings, where characters masked and in fancy dress mingled with the crowds. The reputation for unseemly behavior, unescorted women and assignations motivated a change of name, to the Venetian ''ridotto'', but as "The Man of Taste" observed in 1733;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Lent, if masquerades displease the town,&lt;br&gt;
Call 'em Ridottos and they still go down."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A standard item of masquerade dress was a "Vandyke", improvised on the costumes worn in the portraits of [[Van Dyck]]: [[The Blue Boy|Gainsborough's ''Blue Boy'']] is the most familiar example, and a reminder of the later 18th-century popularity in England for portraits in fancy dress.

Throughout the century, masquerade dances became popular in [[Colonial America]]. Its prominence did not go unchallenged; a significant anti-masquerade movement grew alongside the balls themselves. The anti-masquerade writers (among them such notables as [[Samuel Richardson]]) held that the events encouraged immorality and "foreign influence." While they were sometimes able to persuade authorities to their views, particularly after the [[Lisbon earthquake]] of 1755, enforcement of measures designed to end masquerades was at best desultory, and the masquerades went on as semi-private "subscriptions."&lt;ref&gt;Ribeiro 1978:3.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1770s, fashionable Londoners went to the masquerades organized by [[Teresa Cornelys]] at [[Carlisle House, Soho#Carlisle House, Soho Square|Carlisle House]] in [[Soho Square]], and later to the [[Pantheon, London|Pantheon]].

Masquerade balls were sometimes set as a game among the guests. The masked guests were supposedly dressed so as to be unidentifiable. This would create a type of game to see if a guest could determine each other's identities. This added a humorous effect to many masquerades and enabled a more enjoyable version of typical balls.

One of the most noted masquerade balls of the 20th century was that held at [[Palazzo Labia]] in [[Venice]] on 3 September 1951, hosted by [[Carlos de Beistegui]].  It was dubbed "the party of the century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunne|first1=Dominick|title=All That Glittered|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1998/08/dunne199808|publisher=Vanity Fair|accessdate=18 December 2017|date=15 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another famous ball was The [[Black and White Ball]]. It held on November 28, 1966 at the Plaza Hotel in [[New York City]]. Hosted by author [[Truman Capote]], the ball was in honor of The [[Washington Post]] publisher [[Katharine Graham]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Deborah (2006).

== Masquerade masks ==
Masquerade masks were worn delicately by the prosperous class at balls. Masquerade masks had many uses including hiding one's identity,and using different colour to express one's freedom of speech and voice one's emotions and opinions without judgement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There were two types of base masquerade masks; black masks and white masks.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venetianmaskscollections.wordpress.com/2013/05/21/the-history-of-masquerade-masks/|title=The History of Masquerade Masks|date=2013-05-21|work=Venetian Masks Collections|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designs and patterns were created over the base that was chosen. The main types of masks included masks with a stick, the head mask, the full-face mask, and the half face mask.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  From classics like [[The Phantom of the Opera]] and [[Romeo and Juliet]] to [[The lone ranger|The Lone Ranger]] and [[Gossip Girl]], masquerade masks have been, and are still used in many types of media today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.samanthapeach.co.uk/wordpress/masquerades-from-the-movies/|title=Recreate Masquerade balls from your favourite films|date=2013-07-03|work=Samantha Peach Masquerade Masks|access-date=2017-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary revival ==
A new resurgence of masquerade balls began in the late 1990s in North America. More recently, the party atmosphere is emphasized and the formal dancing usually less prominent. In present times, masquerade masks are used for costumes during Halloween. Masquerade masks are sold in a wide range of stores in different designs, and colors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Cultural references ==
The picturesque quality of the masquerade ball has made it a favorite topic or setting in [[literature]].
[[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s short story "[[The Masque of the Red Death]]" is based at a masquerade ball in which a central figure turns out to be his costume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poe|first1=Edgar Allan|title=[[The Mask of the Red Death]]: A Fantasy|journal=[[Graham's Magazine]]|date=May 1842}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A ball in [[Zürich]] is featured in the novel ''[[Steppenwolf (novel)|Steppenwolf]]'' by [[Hermann Hesse]].
A masquerade ball is central to the plot of [[Mikhail Lermontov]]'s 1835 play ''[[Masquerade (play)|Masquerade]]''. The play was censored and never staged during Lermontov's lifetime, partly because of the implied criticism of the masquerade balls staged by the aristocratic [[Engelhardt family]].
The book, musical and most film adaptations of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' have a scene at a masked ball. The Phantom's (Erik's) costume is that of the Red Death from the aforementioned Edgar Allan Poe story ''The Masque of the Red Death''.
In the play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' by ''[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'', Romeo meets Juliet at a masquerade ball.
The video game "[[Dishonored]]" has a mission called Lady Boyle's Last Party, taking place at a masquerade where the primary objective is discerning the identity of Lady Boyle, a masked party-goer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28687">The '''motherhood penalty''' is a term coined by sociologists who argue that in the [[workplace]], working mothers encounter systematic disadvantages in pay, perceived competence, and benefits relative to childless women. Specifically, women may suffer a per-child [[wage]] penalty, resulting in a pay gap between non-mothers and mothers that is larger than the gap between men and women. Mothers may also suffer worse job-site evaluations indicating that they are less committed to their jobs, less dependable, and less authoritative than non-mothers. Thus, mothers may experience disadvantages in terms of hiring, pay, and daily job experience.&lt;ref name="BudigEngland"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Budig|first=Michelle|author2=Paula England|title=The Wage Penalty for Motherhood|journal=American Sociological Review|year=2001|volume=66|issue=2|doi=10.2307/2657415 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Deborah |author2=Melissa Binder |author3=Kate Krause|title=The Motherhood Wage Penalty Revisited: Experience, Heterogeneity, Work effort and Work-Schedule Flexibility|journal=Industrial and Labor Relations Review|year=2003|volume=56|pages=273–294|doi=10.2307/3590938}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Paik&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correll|first=S. |author2=S. Bernard |author3=I. Paik|title=Getting a job: Is there a motherhood penalty?|journal=American Journal of Sociology|year=2007|pages=1297–1338}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motherhood penalty is not limited to one simple cause but can rather be linked to many theories and societal perceptions.  However, one prominent theory that can be consistently liked to this penalty is the work-effort theory. It is also based on the mother's [[intersectionality]]. There are many effects developed from the motherhood penalty including wage, hiring, and promotion penalties.  These effects are not limited to the United States and have been documented in over a dozen other industrialized nations including Japan, South Korea, The United Kingdom, Poland, and Australia. The penalty has not shown any signs of declining over time.&lt;ref name="Cognitive Bias"&gt;Bernard, Stephen, In Paik, and Shelley Correll. "Cognitive Bias and the Motherhood Penalty." ''Hasting Law Journal'' (2008): 1359-1388. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

===Wage gap===

The most frequently hypothesized explanation of the motherhood wage penalty is that childbearing and childrearing disrupt formal education and on-the-job training.&lt;ref name="StaffMortimer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staff|first=Jeremy|author2=Jaylen Mortimer|year=2012|title=Explaining the Motherhood Penalty During the Early Occupational Career|journal=Demography|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.1007/s13524-011-0068-6|pmc=3272159}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, evidence suggests that educational and training differences between mothers and non-mothers do not entirely explain the penalty for motherhood. The wage gap is not a universal percentage across the US. It varies by state and occupation. It is less prominent in teaching and nursing roles, as these are caregiving careers and therefore seen as "women's work". However, in construction, for example, the wage gap becomes more drastic and even more so for African American women and Latina women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Ryder, G. (n.d.). Women at Work [Review of women at work trends of 2016 ''International Labour Organization'']. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_457317.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; If these women become mothers, their wage gap become more significant as they are then faced time off of work and barriers in the resources and policies that their company has in place.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Sole mothers vs partnered mothers===

When compared it is shown that sole mothers experience not only more financial hard ship but they also lack positive psychosocial interaction and social support in the workforce. Sole mothers also experience an increased likely hood of health complications. Sole mothers face more obstacles when sustaining a job due to their increased risk of missing work due to challenges is finding quality, reliable, and affordable child care.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Robinson, L. D., Magee, C. A., &amp; Caputi, P. (2018). Sole Mothers in the Workforce: A Systematic Review and Agenda for Future Work-Family Research. ''Journal of Family Theory &amp; Review,10''(1), 280-303. doi:10.1111/jftr.12249&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age impact===

Age plays a large role in the strength of the effects on a mother caused by the motherhood penalty.  A study revealed that the effects of motherhood are strong at a younger age and are eventually weakened when the mother reaches her 40s or 50s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://web.a.ebscohost.com.libweb.uwlax.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=7974e303-e874-4cda-a3f9-7945a6e7ae53%40sessionmgr4008], Kahn, J., García‐Manglano, J., &amp; Bianchi, S. (2014). The Motherhood Penalty at Midlife: Long‐Term Effects of Children on Women's Careers. Journal of Marriage and Family, 76(1), 56-72&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if a mother chooses to have children at a younger age, her career may be more affected by the penalty than mothers who choose to wait until after their career has been established.  Women who have children at the beginning of their careers have to make greater accommodations in their lives such as cutting back on education, taking more time off, and pass up on more promotions.  These choices may have a longer lasting effect on the course of a woman's career than having children after being satisfied in a steady job.  Having children at a young age reinforces the idea of motherhood as a status of choice and may reflect to an employer that the woman chooses motherhood over a career.

===Status characteristics theory===

A theoretical claim advanced in the performance expectations and evaluations of workplace competence is that motherhood is a "status characteristic". Status characteristic theory defines a status as a categorical distinction among people such as a personal attribute (e.g., race, gender, physical attractiveness) or role (e.g., motherhood, manager, level of education), that has a cultural understanding or belief attached to it. Status characteristics associate greater status worthiness and competence in some distinctions than with others, and they become notable when the characteristic is believed to be directly relevant to the task at hand.&lt;ref name="Paik"/&gt;

The theoretical construct linking status characteristics, such as race or gender, to differences in behaviors and evaluations is "performance expectations". According to this theory, people implicitly expect more competent task performances from those with more valued status characteristics, and as a result, the people expected to offer more competent performances are evaluated more positively and are given more opportunities.&lt;ref name="Paik" /&gt; The central idea of the theory and empirical research is that ability standards are stricter for those with lower performance expectations or devalued status characteristics. Since performances of lower status actors (mothers) are critically scrutinized, even when "objectively" equal to that of their high-status counterparts (non-mothers), they are less likely to be judged as competent in demonstrating task ability.&lt;ref name="Paik" /&gt;

Status characteristics Theory claims that the standard used to evaluate workers is systematically biased in favor of high-status groups. If motherhood is a devalued status in the setting of a workplace, mothers will be judged with harsher standards than non-mothers; therefore, will have to present greater evidence of their competence.&lt;ref name="Paik" /&gt;

===Motherhood as "status of choice"===

Discrimination against mothers also stems from beliefs about control, [[choice]], and [[autonomy]]. The concept of choice leads people to perceive disadvantaged individuals as responsible for their own condition, regardless of the social circumstances or unfair application of the disadvantage.&lt;ref name="KK" /&gt;  In the context of discrimination against mothers in the workforce, beliefs about choice and control affect the penalties associated with becoming a mother. In the past, most women eventually became mothers. Today, more and more women are not becoming mothers largely due to the pursuit of career aspirations and educational goals by women. Therefore, motherhood is increasingly viewed as a choice that women have the freedom to make. Since motherhood is seen as a choice, employers view mothers as choosing children over their work. When a situation, such as motherhood, is perceived as controllable, the moral judgment associated with that perception leads to discrimination. Consequently, mothers who are perceived as having more control over their status as mothers are penalized more than mothers who are perceived as having less control.&lt;ref name="KK" /&gt; An experiment done on hiring practices showed that mothers are discriminated against more strongly, in terms of hiring and salary recommendations, when understandings of choice were primed.&lt;ref name="KK" /&gt;

===Normative discrimination===

Normative discrimination stems from descriptive and prescriptive [[stereotyping]]. Descriptive stereotypes are widely shared beliefs about different traits and abilities men and women possess. Due to descriptive stereotypes, men are assumed to be intelligent and assertive, which are qualities often associated with leadership and workplace achievement. Women are assumed to possess greater communal qualities and helping behavior such as warmth, empathy, and selflessness. Discrimination based on descriptive stereotypes occurs when women are seen as unfit or insufficiently competent to perform a stereotypical male job.&lt;ref name="Paik"/&gt; While descriptive stereotypes influence beliefs about what men and women can do, prescriptive and proscriptive stereotypes influence beliefs about what men and women should or should not do to follow societal norms.&lt;ref name="RudmanGlick"&gt;Rudman, Laurie, and Peter Glick (2001). "Prescriptive Gender Stereotypes and Backlash Toward Agentic Women." ''Journal of Social Issues'' 57.4: 743-62. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The expectations of an ideal employee and an ideal parent are influenced from the past when men composed the majority of the workforce while women were often confined to household duties and childcare. Benard and Correll conducted a study that found mothers are still currently discriminated against even when they prove their competence and commitment. They discovered that evaluators viewed highly successful mothers as less warm and more interpersonally hostile than comparable workers who are not mothers.&lt;ref name="Paik" /&gt; Stereotypical gender role expectations cause many challenges for mothers who are reentering the workplace.&lt;ref name="Nelson Lips"&gt;Nelson, Sofia, and Hilary Lips (2009). "The Motherhood Penalty: "Sequencing Moms" Pay a Price."n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that women are thought of as more caring, they are often expected to be the primary caregiver. When women break this stereotype, they are liked less because they are violating the prescriptive stereotypes about women as mothers.&lt;ref name="RudmanGlick"/&gt;

Mothers in the American culture are impacted by [[normative social influence]] leading them to believe that they are supposed to prioritize the needs of dependent children above all other activities.&lt;ref name=KK&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kricheli-Katz|first=Tamar|title=Choice, Discrimination, and the Motherhood Penalty|journal=Law &amp; Society Review|year=2012|volume=46|issue=3|pages=557–587|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5893.2012.00506.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this definition, a "good mother" will direct all of her time and energy toward her child, and therefore be a less committed and less productive worker.&lt;ref name=" KK"/&gt; The cultural norm that mothers should always be there for their children coexist in tension with the normative belief of the "ideal worker" should always be there for his or her employer. These normative conceptions of an "ideal worker" and a "good mother" create a cultural tension between the motherhood role and the committed worker role. These conflicting roles can lead employers to engage in normative discrimination, in which they recognize the competence of mothers but believe that it is their duty to remain at home with their children.&lt;ref name="Paik"/&gt; This perception of mothers penalizes them on two of the three interpersonal ratings, being seen as less likable and warm compared to their non-mother and father peers in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Paik" /&gt;

==Criticism==
===Work-effort theory===

This is the most prominent theory seen across all research done on this topic. This is another possible explanation of the motherhood penalty. The work-effort theory concentrates on the productivity of the workers.&lt;ref name=Ewa&gt;{{cite news|last=Cukrowska|first=Ewa|title=Investigating the Motherhood Penalty in a Post-Communist Economy: Evidence From Poland|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach states that the wage penalty faced by mothers may be due to actual productivity differences between mothers and non-mothers.&lt;ref name=Australia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Livermore|first=Tanya |author2=Joan Rodgers |author3=Peter Siminski|title=The Effect of Motherhood on Wages and Wage Growth: Evidence for Australia|journal=University of Wollongong Economics Working Paper Series|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Productivity differences can occur if taking care of children leaves mothers with less energy to exert at work.&lt;ref name="Australia"/&gt; Additionally, mothers may also be less productive at work because they are saving their energy for their "second shift" at home.&lt;ref name="Ewa"/&gt; Lower wages for women with children may reflect the choices made by mothers, like trading more flexible hours for lower wages. However, it also may reflect employer bias and discrimination.&lt;ref name="Seven"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harkness|first=Susan|author2=Jane Waldfogel|year=2003|title=The Family Gap in Pay: Evidence from Seven Industrialized Countries|journal=Research in Labor Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the difference in how employers handle benefit packages and full-time work requirements.

==Effects==
The effects of motherhood penalty can be more or less severe on a mother depending on the variables of how old the mother is and also how many children the mother is raising.  Younger mothers who are just entering the work force may suffer more severe consequences that older mothers who have already contributed to the work force.  Women who have more children are also more likely to have to sacrifice more in their work lives and therefore leave themselves open to suffer greater career setbacks related to the motherhood penalty.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;[http://web.a.ebscohost.com.libweb.uwlax.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=7974e303-e874-4cda-a3f9-7945a6e7ae53%40sessionmgr4008], Kahn, J., García‐Manglano, J., &amp; Bianchi, S. (2014). The Motherhood Penalty at Midlife: Long‐Term Effects of Children on Women's Careers. Journal of Marriage and Family, 76(1), 56-72&lt;/ref&gt; The motherhood penalty can cause an negative impact of working women's health due to their expectation to be the primary care giver at home for their children and the stress of proving themselves as dedicated at work and producing quality work.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The motherhood penalty describes how mothers suffer severe wage and hiring disadvantages in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Gender and Career Choice Process"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Correll|first=Shelley|title=Gender and the Career Choice Process: The Role of Biased Self-Assessments|journal=American Journal of Sociology|year=2001|volume=106|issue=6|pages=1691–1730|doi=10.1086/321299}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status of motherhood has important ramifications on hiring, promotion, and salary processes. Depending on their status, studies have found that under the age of 35, the wage gap between mothers and non-mothers was even larger than the wage gap between men and women.&lt;ref name="Crittenden"&gt;Crittenden, Ann (2001).

===Wage penalty for motherhood===

Motherhood penalty is significant to the [[gender wage gap]] because studies found that employed mothers are the women that account for most of the gender wage gap.&lt;ref name="Glass"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glass | first1 = Jennifer | year = 2004 | title = Blessing or curse?: Work-family policies and mother's wage growth over time.. | url = | journal = Work and Occupations | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 367–394 | doi=10.1177/0730888404266364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that hourly wages of mothers are approximately 5% lower (per child) than the wages of non-mothers.&lt;ref name="StaffMortimer"/&gt; TheResearch by Sigle-Rushton and Waldfogel found that 81% of mothers with children under the age of 18 made less than $40,000 per year compared to only 44% of fathers&lt;ref&gt;[https://link-springer-com.libweb.uwlax.edu/article/10.1007/s11199-009-9670-0, Lips, H., &amp; Lawson, K.

Sex Roles, 61(9), 667-676.&lt;/ref&gt; wage penalty incurred by women for motherhood varies significantly across nations as do work-family policies. Therefore, it is unclear if variations in motherhood wage penalties are linked to specific work-family policies.&lt;ref name=Work-Family&gt;{{cite journal|last=Budig|first=Michelle |author2=Joya Misra |author3=Irene Boeckmann|title=The Motherhood Penalty in Cross-National Perspective: The Importance of Work–Family Policies and Cultural Attitudes|journal=Oxford Journal|year=2012|volume=19|issue=2|pages=163–193|doi=10.1093/sp/jxs006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women in lower wage jobs suffer a greater percentage of loss in hourly wages as a result of motherhood than women in more highly paid professions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Hiring penalty for motherhood===

Mothers are less likely to get hired than non-mothers.&lt;ref name="StaffMortimer"/&gt; Correll, Benard, and Paik created a study that looked at the hiring practices and preferences of employers.&lt;ref name="Getting hired"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alol|first=Daniel|date=Aug 2005|title=Mothers Face Disadvantages in Getting Hired|journal=Cornell University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the evaluation of hypothetical resumes from two applicant profiles that were functionally equivalent. Their resumes were both very strong and when presenting these resumes, no one preferred one applicant over the other and they were seen as equally qualified. Next, a memo mentioning that the applicant was a mother of two children was added to one of the profiles. When participants were asked if they would hire these applicants, participants said they would hire 84 percent of the women without children, compared with only 47 percent of the mothers. These findings showed that mothers are 79 percent less likely to be hired.&lt;ref name="Paik"/&gt; Participants offered non-mothers an average of $11,000 more than mothers.&lt;ref name="Getting hired"/&gt; An audit study also showed that prospective employers were less likely to call back mothers for interviews than non-mothers.&lt;ref name="StaffMortimer"/&gt;

In another experiment, participants evaluated application materials for a pair of same race, same gender job applicants who were equally qualified but differed on parental status. Relative to other kinds of applicants, mothers were rated as less competent, less committed, less suitable for hire, promotion, and management training, and deserving of lower salaries. Mothers were also held to higher performance and punctuality standards.&lt;ref name="Paik"/&gt; The study results showed that mothers are 100% less likely to be promoted because mothers are assumed to be less competent and committed than women without children.&lt;ref name="Paik"/&gt;

===Motherhood vs. fatherhood===

Several recent studies have shown a wage penalty against maternity leave in the United States. Men do not suffer this penalty. Men's wages are either unaffected or even increase after having a child.&lt;ref name="BudigEngland"/&gt;  A study by a Stanford sociologist Shelley Correll found that employers perceived mothers as less competent than childless women, and also perceived childless men as less competent and committed than men who were fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Schechter,[http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2011/motherhood-penalty-remains-pervasive-problem-workplace Motherhood penalty remains a pervasive problem in the workplace]", ''GenderNews'', 22 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the researcher found that fathers are 1.83 times more likely to be recommended for management than childless men, a difference that is marginally significant. For female applicants, childless women are 8.2 times more likely than mothers to be recommended for management&lt;ref name="Paik"/&gt; This difference between mothers and fathers is partly due to cultural norms about gender roles and mechanisms present in the market that create disadvantages for mothers from reduced bargaining power or employer discrimination.&lt;ref name=Gangl&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gangl|first=Markus|author2=Andrea Ziefle|title=Motherhood, Labor Force Behavior, and Women's Careers: An Empirical Assessment of the Wage Penalty for Motherhood in Britain, Germany, and the United States|journal=Demography|year=2009|volume=46|issue=2|doi=10.1353/dem.0.0056|pages=341–369|pmc=2831275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconciliation policies==
There have been many welfare policies that attempt to resolve the effects of the motherhood penalty. Reconciliation policies include policies such as paid or unpaid [[parental leave|parental and family leave]], childcare policies supporting subsidized or state-provided care, and flexible work-time policies.&lt;ref name=Reconciliation&gt;{{cite journal|last=Misra|first=Joya |author2=Michelle Budig |author3=Stephanie Moller|title=Reconciliation Policies and the Effects of Motherhood on Employment, Earnings, and Poverty|journal=Luxembourg Income Study Working Paper Series|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reconciliation policies aimed at improving economic opportunity and equality of mothers should focus on lifting the time constraints on women and changing social norms of gender roles.&lt;ref name="World Bank"&gt;{{cite book|title=World Development Report 2012: Gender Equality and Development|year=2012|publisher=The World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically, work-family reconciliation policies should give mothers (and fathers) the opportunity to advance in the workplace, while also ensuring that their families receive adequate care. While all reconciliation policies may support work-family balance, these policies draw upon different assumptions about women's roles in society, and therefore may lead to diverse outcomes regarding equity.&lt;ref name="Reconciliation"/&gt;

An alternative to welfare policies is a [[fundamental rights]] approach, where a child holds the fundamental constitutional right to both care and financial support from both parents on an equal basis, unless the parents expressly agree otherwise (or adoptive parent(s) assume such responsibilities). As paternity has become more and more inexpensive to prove and as more and more evidence comes in on the benefits to children from [[shared earning/shared parenting marriage|shared earning/shared parenting]], the fundamental rights approach is gaining more credence and becoming easier to establish as a legal matter. One example of this is the United Kingdom, which has a parental responsibility concept in the law that requires parents to meet the needs of children, such as a right to a home and a right to be maintained.  The law does not see children as having a right to care by both biological parents as a default matter.  Instead it holds responsible all mothers but only (a) married fathers (for any child born to the father's wife) and (b) unmarried fathers who assert such responsibility in an agreement with the mother or by court order.  It also states that all parents have financial responsibility for their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parental Rights and Responsibilities|url=https://www.gov.uk/parental-rights-responsibilities/what-is-parental-responsibility|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The law has not been amended since paternity testing became more inexpensive.

===Welfare policies===

Joya Misra, Michelle Budig and [[Stephanie Moller]] did a study looking at the consequences of these different [[welfare]] strategies.&lt;ref name="Reconciliation"/&gt; The study focuses on welfare state regime strategies with an emphasis on work/family reconciliation policies meant to help men and women reconcile their roles as workers and parents. The study looks at the effects of these strategies on labor force participation rates, wage rates, and poverty rates, analyzing the effects of motherhood and marital status on labor force participation rates, annual earnings, and poverty rates. They argue that four major strategies that have appeared:

#Primary Caregiver/Secondary Earner Strategy: Where women are treated primarily as carers, and secondarily as earners, focuses on valuing the care engaged by women.
#Primary Earner/Secondary Caregiver Strategy: Where women are treated primarily as earners, and secondarily as carers, focuses on encouraging women's labor market participation.
#Choice Srategy: Where women are treated primarily as earners, and secondarily as carers) focuses on providing support for women's employment, but also gives women the choice of emphasizing caregiving young children.
#Earner-Carer Strategy: Where women are treated as equally involved in both earning and caring, focuses on helping men and women balance care and work through support for care both inside and outside of the home.&lt;ref name="Reconciliation" /&gt;

The study suggests that the earner-carer strategy is most effective at increasing equity for the widest array of women.&lt;ref name="Reconciliation"/&gt; In this strategy, motherhood is associated with the least negative effects on employment, as well as on poverty levels. The researchers do acknowledge that a range of other policies such as tax policies, unemployment insurance, family allowances, child support, housing subsidies could also be shaping the outcomes.&lt;ref name="Reconciliation"/&gt;

===Leave policies===

Leave policies are intended to support parental care giving while enabling employment continuity. Leave length impacts employers' perceptions of mothers' employability and mothers' earnings.  Moderate leaves reduce pay gaps by ensuring women remain attached to their workplace while children are infants; however, leaves that are too short or too long increase pay gaps because they are linked to decreases in employment continuity and earnings.

'''Nadezhda (Nadia) Vasil'yevna Popova''' ({{lang-uk|Надія Василівна Попова}}, {{lang-ru|Наде́жда Васи́льевна Попо́ва}}; 17 December 1921 – 8 July 2013) was a squadron commander in the 46th Taman Guards Night Bomber Regiment during the second world war who achieved significant domestic publicity after completing 18 bombing sorties in one night with navigator [[Yekaterina Ryabova]]. She was featured in [[Ogoniok|Ogonyok]] magazine&lt;ref&gt;Журнал «Огонёк» № 2-3 1945 г. (страница 2)

(Ogonyok Magazine No 2-3, 1945. page 2)&lt;/ref&gt; and many other major Soviet publications during the war. [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] featured her portrait in a March issue after she was awarded the title [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] on 23 February 1945 for completing 737 sorties.

==Early life==
Popova was born in Shabanovka (Orlovskaya oblast), [[Russia]], on 17 December 1921.&lt;ref name="nytobit"&gt;{{cite news |first=Douglas |last=Martin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/15/world/europe/nadezhda-popova-ww-ii-night-witch-dies-at-91.html |title=Nadezhda Popova, WWII 'Night Witch', Dies at 91 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daughter of a railwayman, she grew up near the [[Donetsk]] coal fields in [[Ukraine]]. As an adolescent, she loved music, song, and dance, taking part in amateur plays and musicals, dreaming of becoming an actress. ''[[The Economist]]'' reported that she was a "wild spirit, easily bored; she loved to tango, foxtrot, sing along to jazz. It made her feel free."&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21581962-nadezhda-nadia-popova-night-bomber-pilot-died-july-8th-aged-91-nadia-popova |title=Nadia Popova |work=[[The Economist]] |date=19 July 2013}} (Obituary)&lt;/ref&gt; When a small aircraft landed near her village, she became enamored with aviation, enrolling in a gliding school at the age of 15&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt; without telling her parents.{{sfnp|Milanetti|2011|page=94}} "Walking towards a plane, every time, she would get a knot in her stomach; every time she took off, she was thrilled all over again."&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

In 1937, she made both her first parachute jump and her first solo flight at the age of sixteen. Despite her parents' opposition, she pursued her new passion and obtained her flying license.

She was initially rejected as a student by a pilot school,{{sfnp|Milanetti|2011|page=79}} but after [[Polina Osipenko]], the Inspector for Aviation in the Moscow Military District, recommended her, she  was allowed to enroll in the Kherson flight school, graduating at the age of eighteen and becoming a flight instructor.{{sfnp|Milanetti|2011|page=95}}

==World War II==
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev and Nadezhda Popova.jpg|thumb|left|Popova with Russian president [[Dmitry Medvedev|Medvedev]] in 2009]]
Popova volunteered to be a military pilot, but the government initially barred women from combat and turned her away.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;  But in October 1941, [[Joseph Stalin]] caved in to pressure from [[Marina Raskova]] and permitted the creation of three women's aviation regiments.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;

Popova, whose brother Leonid had been killed at the front in 1941 and whose home had been taken by invading German troops,&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt; was sent by [[Marina Raskova]] to Engels to join other women being trained to become military pilots.  She then joined a night bombing regiment, and rose to command the 2nd Women's Regiment (1941–45),{{sfnp|Axell|2002|pages=60–68}} flying the [[Polikarpov Po-2]], a bi-plane used as a crop duster before the war.  The Women's Regiment flew exclusively at night; their planes, which were not equipped with guns, radios, radar, or parachutes, would incinerate immediately if hit with even minimal ordnance.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;  

On 10 March 1942, during a training mission, Popova was leading a formation when two aircraft got lost in a heavy blizzard and crashed, killing their all-female crews. These were the first casualties sustained by her unit.{{sfnp|Milanetti|2011|page=95}}  After training, she was sent to fight in her childhood home region of the Donetsk coal fields.  The regiment was called "Nachthexen" ([[Night Witches]]) by the Germans "because the whooshing noise their plywood and canvas airplanes made reminded the Germans of the sound of a witch’s broomstick."&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt;

Popova was shot down several times in the three years she spent fighting, but was never badly wounded.&lt;ref name="nytobit" /&gt; On 2 August 1942, she was on a day reconnaissance mission when she was attacked by [[Luftwaffe]] fighters and forced to make an emergency landing near [[Cherkessk]]. Trying to return to her unit, she joined a motorized column, and among the wounded met her future husband, fighter pilot Semyon Kharlamov, who was reading ''[[And Quiet Flows the Don]]''.{{sfnp|Milanetti|2011|page=95}}

She later flew a relief mission through enemy fire over [[Novorossiysk]], dropping food, water and medical supplies to the forces trapped in [[Malaya Zemlya]], nearly not making it. After returning, she found her aircraft riddled with bullet holes, right down to her map and helmet.{{sfnp|Milanetti|2011|page=95}}{{sfnp|Axell|2002|pages=67-68}}

As the Axis forces began their retreat, Popova's unit followed the front through Belarus and Poland and eventually entered Germany. It was in Poland that she reached her personal record of 18 sorties in one night.{{sfnp|Milanetti|2011|page=95}} In total, Popova completed 852 sorties in the war.&lt;ref name=Economist/&gt;

==Post-war life==
The [[Night Witches|46th Guards Night Bomber Regiment]] was dissolved in October 1945, and Popova returned to her town to a hero's welcome, complete with marching band and flowers thrown over her car. She was driven to the theatre, where 2,000 people were waiting for her, among them one of the marines she had helped in Malaya Zemlya.{{sfnp|Milanetti|2011|page=95}}

She married soon after the war - her husband went on to attain the rank of [[Colonel General#Russia|colonel general]] in the Soviet Air Force, and her son Aleksandr is a graduate of the Air Academy - and she worked as a flight instructor for almost two decades.{{sfnp|Axell|2002|pages=60–68}} Popova was widowed in 1990.{{sfnp|Milanetti|2011|page=95}}

Popova died on 8 July 2013 at the age of 91.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite web |title=Умерла летчица, Герой Советского Союза, уроженка Донбасса Надежда Попова |trans-title=Dead pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union, a native of Donbass Nadezhda Popova |publisher=Nbnews.com.ua |url=http://nbnews.com.ua/ru/news/93345/ |accessdate=2013-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Official Secret Act 1923''' is [[India]]'s anti-[[espionage]] act held over from the British [[colonisation|colonial period]]. It states clearly that actions which involve helping an enemy state against India are strongly condemned. It also states that one cannot approach, inspect, or even pass over a prohibited government site or area. According to this Act, helping the enemy state can be in the form of communicating a sketch, plan, model of an official secret, or of official codes or [[Password|passwords]], to the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiacode.nic.in/qrydisp.asp?tfnm=192319%20&amp;tfnm2=3]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prosecution and penalties ==
Punishments under the Act range from three to fourteen years [[imprisonment]]. A person prosecuted under this Act can be charged with the crime even if the action was unintentional and not intended to endanger the security of the state. The Act only empowers persons in positions of authority to handle official secrets, and others who handle it in prohibited areas or outside them are liable for punishment. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.india.gov.in/allimpfrms/allacts/3314.pdf "Act No. 19 of 1923 dated 2nd. April, 1923"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Journalist|Journalists]] have to help members of the [[Police|police forces]] above the rank of the sub-Inspector and members of the [[military]] with investigation regarding an offense, up to and including revealing his sources of information.

Under the Act, search warrants may be issued at any time if the magistrate determines that based on the evidence there is enough danger to the security of the state.

Uninterested members of the public may be excluded from court proceedings if the prosecution feels that any information which is going to be passed on during the proceedings is sensitive. This also includes media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiacode.nic.in/qrydisp.asp?tfnm=192319%20&amp;tfnm2=3]&lt;/ref&gt;

When a company is seen as the offender under this Act, everyone involved with the management of the company, including the board of directors, can be liable for punishment. In the case of a newspaper, everyone – including the [[Editing|editor]], [[Publishing|publisher]] and the proprietor — can be imprisoned for an offense.
OSA is controversial to the modern RTI act 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.india.gov.in/allimpfrms/allacts/3314.pdf "Act No. 19 of 1923 dated 2nd. April, 1923"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

=== Conflict with right to information ===
In the OSA clause 6, information from any governmental office is considered official information, hence it can be used to override [[Right to Information Act 2005]] requests. This has drawn harsh criticism.

=== Iftikhar Gilani case ===

In June 2002, journalist Iftikhar Gilani was, arrested for violating the OSA 1923. He was charged under the OSA, with a case under the Obscenity Act added to it. The first military report suggested that the information he was accused of holding was "secret" despite being publicly available. The second military intelligence report contradicted this, stating that there was no "official secret". Even after this, the government denied the opinion of the military and was on the verge of challenging it when the contradictions were exposed in the press.

The military reported that, "the information contained in the document is easily available" and "the documents carries no security classified information and the information seems to have been gathered from [[OSINT|open sources]]".

On 13 January 2004, the government withdrew its case against him to prevent having two of its ministries having to give contradictory opinions. Gilani was released the same month.

== Reforms ==
After reviewing the provisions of the act, the [[Union Home Ministry]] in July 2017 submitted a report to the Cabinet secretariat. The goal was to amend the act to make it more transparent and in line with the [[Right to Information Act, 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Home Ministry submits report on proposal to amend Official Secrets Act|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/home-ministry-submits-report-on-proposal-to-amend-osa-4770758/|accessdate=5 April 2018|work=The Indian Express|date=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Recent News ==
===  Delhi court judgement in the case involving journalist Santanu Saikia ===
A Delhi court in a 2009 judgement, in a case involving the publication of excerpts of a cabinet note in the Financial Express ten years earlier by Santanu Saikia, greatly reduced the powers of the act by ruling publication of a document merely labelled "secret" shall not render the journalist liable under the law. 

Saikia was arrested in February, 2015 in another case that the police said involved the writing of stories and analyses from documents allegedly stolen from the government. He was released on bail in May after spending 80 days in jail.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-02-26/india/28003463_1_cbi-case-delhi-court-official-secrets-act&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 50 cases of Official Secrets Act violation since 2014 ===

50 cases of violation of the Official Secrets Act were registered in the country since 2014. Of these 50 cases, 30 were registered in 2016, nine in 2015 and 11 in 2014 according to Union Minister of state for Home Hansraj Ahir. Of the 30 cases registered in 2014, eight were lodged in Tamil Nadu, followed by five each in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. &lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mha-reviews-draconian-official-secrets-act/articleshow/59800375.cms.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3090">'''Operation Dawn''', [[code-name]] '''Fajr''' (الفجر) in [[Arabic]],&lt;ref name=Shlaim&gt;Shlaim, Avi.  "Israel: Poor Little Samsom" in ''The 1967 Arab-Israeli War: Origins and Consequences'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=AqshAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 p. 30] (Cambridge University Press, 2012, edited by Shlaim and Louis).&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Egypt]]ian military operation planned to strike the [[Israeli Air Force]], in the prelude to what would become the [[Six-Day War]]. The Egyptian attack plan was to also involve strategic bombing of major ports, the [[Negev Nuclear Research Center]] near [[Dimona]], airfields and cities. Arab armies would then attack,  effectively cutting [[Israel]] in half with an armoured thrust from northern [[Sinai]] via the [[Negev desert]].&lt;ref name="The Six Day War"&gt;[http://www.sixdaywar.org/content/Immediate-Drift.asp The Six Day War]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] had provoked Israel when he closed the [[Straits of Tiran]] on May 22, 1967. He was intent on reversing previous military defeats. The Egyptian army mobilized in the Sinai desert, and was poised to launch what Nasser called "the operation that will surprise the world". The operation was set to take place on May 27, 1967.&lt;ref name=Shlaim /&gt;  [[Abdel Hakim Amer]], an Egyptian general, planned the operation.&lt;ref name="The Six Day War"/&gt;

According to the Israeli diplomat [[Michael Oren]], Operation Dawn was called off after Nasser was informed by the [[Soviet Union]] that the United States was aware of the plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussliberty.org/orenbook.htm Michael Oren's Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East]&lt;/ref&gt;  Israel sent urgent messages to the United States on May 25, 1967, saying an attack from Egypt was imminent. Israel then invaded on June 5, 1967.

==Debate about whether Egypt had really posed an imminent military threat==
The White House ordered an intelligence assessment, which found the Israeli claims unfounded. Israeli prime minister Eshkol wrote on a copy of one of the urgent messages transmitted to the United States "All to create an alibi".&lt;ref&gt;"1967", by Tom Segev (kindle location 4966-4986)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[John Quigley (academic)|John Quigley]], there is thin evidence that there was any Egyptian plan to attack Israel that would actually have been carried out.&lt;ref&gt;"The Six-Day War and Israel Self-Defense", John Quigley, p. 34 (Cambridge University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Israelis claimed that they knew from "Egyptian uncovered documents" that there was an Egyptian plan to attack and cut off Negev, capture [[Eilat]], and make occupied land contiguous to Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/why-diplomacy-failed-to-avert-the-six-day-war Why Diplomacy Failed to Avert the Six Day War]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Shrouded Horizon''' was an 18-month international [[law enforcement]] investigation culminating in the July 2015 seizure of [[Darkode]], an online [[cybercrime]] [[online forum|forum]] and [[black market]], and the arrest of several of its members. The case involved law enforcement agencies from 20 countries, led by the [[United States]] [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) with the assistance of [[Europol]], in what the FBI called "the largest-ever coordinated law enforcement effort directed at an online cyber criminal forum".&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt;&lt;ref name=doj/&gt;&lt;ref name=allthedetails/&gt;

Law enforcement agents gained access to the invite-only website through undisclosed means and collected information over an extended period, leading to equipment seizures, searches, or arrests of 70 individuals globally, leading to indictments against 12 for crimes including [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act|computer fraud]], conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit [[mail and wire fraud|wire fraud]], conspiracy to commit [[money laundering]], conspiracy to send [[malware|malicious code]], [[spamming]], [[identity theft]], [[racketeering]], conspiracy to commit [[bank fraud]], [[extortion]], and conspiracy to commit [[Cybercrime_and_countermeasures#Access_Device_Fraud_Statutes|access device fraud]].&lt;ref name=fbi/&gt;&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;&lt;ref name=allthedetails/&gt;&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;&lt;ref name=fireeye/&gt;&lt;ref name=scariest/&gt; Among those arrested were administrators for [[darknet market]] [[TheRealDeal]], who were also active at Darkode.&lt;ref name=cox/&gt;

Upon announcing the charges, [[United States Attorney]] [[David J. Hickton]] called the site "a cyber hornet's nest of criminal hackers" which "represented one of the gravest threats to the integrity of data on computers in the United States".&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;&lt;ref name=independent/&gt;&lt;ref name=doj/&gt;&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt;

[[Image:Operation Shrouded Horizon map (DOJ image).jpg|thumb|Map of the 20 countries which provided law enforcement assistance during Operation Shrouded Horizon]]
Though led by the FBI and assisted by Europol, reports credit agencies in 20 countries: [[Australia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Cyprus]], [[Croatia]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Israel]], [[Latvia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Sweden]], [[United Kingdom]], and United States.&lt;ref name=allthedetails/&gt;&lt;ref name=europol/&gt;

Only two weeks after the announcement of the raid, the site reappeared with increased security, employing [[Bitcoin]]-based [[Blockchain (database)|blockchain]] authentication and operating on the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]].&lt;ref name=register/&gt;&lt;ref name=clark/&gt;&lt;ref name=kovacs/&gt;&lt;ref name=itonlytook/&gt;

[[File:Ossians Schwanengesang.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Ossian Singing'', [[Nicolai Abildgaard]], 1787]]
{{improve|reason=Article lacks quite imporant information, cp. [[Talk:Ossian#Gaelic text?]]|date=November 2017}}
'''Ossian''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|ʃ|ən|,_|ˈ|ɒ|s|i|ən}}; [[Irish Gaelic]]/[[Scottish Gaelic]]: ''Oisean'') is the narrator and purported author of a cycle of [[epic poem]]s published by the Scottish poet [[James Macpherson]] from 1760. Macpherson claimed to have collected [[word-of-mouth]] material in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], said to be from ancient sources, and that the work was his translation of that material. Ossian is based on [[Oisín]], son of Finn or [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]], anglicised to Finn McCool, a legendary bard who is a character in [[Irish mythology]].  Contemporary critics were divided in their view of the work's authenticity, but the consensus since is that Macpherson framed the poems himself, based on old folk tales he had collected.

The work was internationally popular, translated into all the literary languages of Europe and was highly influential both in the development of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] and the [[Gaelic revival]]. "The contest over the authenticity of Macpherson's pseudo-Gaelic productions," Curley asserts, "became a seismograph of the fragile unity within restive diversity of [[British Empire|imperial]] [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in the age of [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]]." Macpherson's fame was crowned by his burial among the literary giants in [[Westminster Abbey]]. [[William Paton Ker|W.P. Ker]], in the ''Cambridge History of English Literature'', observes that "all Macpherson's craft as a philological impostor would have been nothing without his literary skill."&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Cambridge History of English Literature'', vol. 10 "The Age of Johnson": "The Literary Influence of the Middle Ages" p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The poems==
[[File:Krafft Ossian und Malvina.jpg|thumb|''Ossian and Malvina'', by [[Johann Peter Krafft]], 1810]]
In 1760 Macpherson published the English-language text ''Fragments of ancient poetry, collected in the Highlands of Scotland, and translated from the Gaelic or Erse language''.&lt;ref name="litpedia"&gt;{{citation |title=[[The Literary Encyclopedia (English)|Literary Encyclopedia]] |year=2004 |contribution-url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=9045 |contribution=Fragments of Ancient Poetry, Collected in the Highlands of Scotland |accessdate=27 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year, he claimed to have obtained further manuscripts and in 1761 he claimed to have found an [[Epic poetry|epic]] on the subject of the hero Fingal, written by Ossian. The name Fingal or ''Fionnghall'' means "white stranger".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.behindthename.com/php/view.php?name=fingal |title=Behind the Name: View Name: Fingal}}&lt;/ref&gt;   According to Macpherson's prefatory material, his publisher, claiming that there was no market for these works except in English, required that they be translated. Macpherson published these translations during the next few years, culminating in a collected edition, ''The Works of Ossian'', in 1765. The most famous of these Ossianic poems was ''Fingal'', written in 1762.

The supposed original poems are translated into poetic prose, with short and simple sentences.  The mood is [[epic poetry|epic]], but there is no single narrative, although the same characters reappear.  The main characters are Ossian himself, relating the stories when old and blind, his father Fingal (very loosely based on the Irish hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]]), his dead son Oscar (also with an [[Oscar (Irish mythology)|Irish counterpart]]), and Oscar's lover [[Malvina (character)|Malvina]] (like [[Fiona]] a name invented by Macpherson), who looks after Ossian in his old age.  Though the stories "are of endless battles and unhappy loves", the enemies and causes of strife are given little explanation and context.&lt;ref name="Okun, 328"&gt;Okun, 328&lt;/ref&gt;

Characters are given to killing loved ones by mistake, and dying of grief, or of joy.  There is very little information given on the religion, culture or society of the characters, and buildings are hardly mentioned.  The landscape "is more real than the people who inhabit it.

==Reception==
The poems achieved international success. [[Napoleon]] and [[Diderot]] were great admirers, and [[Voltaire]] wrote parodies of them.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Gaskill, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uDYPtqw0MHwC&amp;pg=PA140 The reception of Ossian in Europe]'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas Jefferson]] thought Ossian "the greatest poet that has ever existed",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite journal|first=Frederick|last=Carpenter|title=The Vogue of Ossian in America|journal=American Literature|volume=2|year=1930–1931|pages=405–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and planned to learn Gaelic so as to read his poems in the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1989 |editor1-last=Wilson |editor1-first=Douglas L. |title=Thomas Jefferson's Literary Commonplace Book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wwABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA172|location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press |publication-date= |page=172 |isbn=0691047200 |access-date=8 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] writers such as [[Homer]].  Many writers were influenced by the works, including [[Walter Scott]], and painters and composers chose Ossianic subjects.

One poem was translated into French in 1762, and by 1777 the whole ''corpus''.&lt;ref name="Okun, 330"&gt;Okun, 330&lt;/ref&gt;  In the German-speaking states [[Michael Denis]] made the first full translation in 1768–69, inspiring the proto-nationalist poets [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock|Klopstock]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], whose own German translation of a portion of Macpherson's work figures prominently in a climactic scene of ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' (1774).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berresford Ellis|1987|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold M. ''Thor, myth to marvel''; Continuum Publishing, 2011, pp92-97.&lt;/ref&gt; Goethe's associate [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] wrote an essay titled ''Extract from a correspondence about Ossian and the Songs of Ancient Peoples'' (1773) in the early days of the [[Sturm und Drang]] movement.

Complete Danish translations were made in 1790, and Swedish ones in 1794–1800.  In Scandinavia and Germany the Celtic nature of the setting was ignored or not understood, and Ossian was regarded as a Nordic or Germanic figure who became a symbol for nationalist aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Okun, 330, 339&lt;/ref&gt;  The French general [[Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte]], who was made King [[Charles XIV John of Sweden]] and [[King of Norway]], had already named his only son after a character from Ossian, at the suggestion of [[Napoleon]], the child's godfather and an admirer of Ossian;&lt;ref name="Okun, 330"/&gt;. Born in 1799, Bernadotte's son later became King [[Oscar I of Sweden and Norway]], and was succeeded by his son [[Oscar II]] (d. 1907). "Oscar" being a Royal Swedish name led to its becoming also a common male first name, especially in Scandinavia but also in other European countries.

[[Melchiore Cesarotti]] was an Italian clergyman whose translation into Italian is said by many to improve on the original, and was a tireless promoter of the poems, in [[Vienna]] and [[Warsaw]] as well as Italy.  It was his translation that Napoleon especially admired,&lt;ref name="Okun, 330"/&gt; and among others it influenced [[Ugo Foscolo]] who was Cesarotti's pupil in the [[University of Padua]].

[[File:Ossiansongs.JPG|thumb|right|''The Songs of Ossian'', ink and watercolors, [[Ingres]], 1811–13]]

By 1800 Ossian was translated into Spanish and Russian, with Dutch following in 1805, and Polish, Czech and Hungarian in 1827–33.&lt;ref name="Okun, 330"/&gt;  The poems were as much admired in Hungary as in France and Germany; Hungarian [[János Arany]] wrote "Homer and Ossian" in response, and several other Hungarian writers – Baróti Szabó, [[Mihály Csokonai Vitéz|Csokonai]], [[Sándor Kisfaludy]], [[Ferenc Kazinczy|Kazinczy]], [[Kölcsey]], [[Ferenc Toldy]], and Ágost Greguss, were also influenced by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Elek |last=Oszkár |title=Ossian-kultusz Magyarországon |journal=Egyetemes Philologiai Közlöny |issue=LVII |year=1933 |pages=66–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first partial [[Polish language|Polish]] translation of Ossian was made by [[Ignacy Krasicki]] in 1793. The complete translation appeared in 1838 by [[Seweryn Goszczyński]].  The most influential Russian version of Ossian was the 1792 translation by [[Ermil Ivanovich Kostrov|Ermil Kostrov]], who based his work on Pierre Le Tourneur's 1777 translation from the original.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The opera ''[[Ossian, ou Les bardes]]'' by [[Jean-François Le Sueur|Le Sueur]] (with the famous, multimedial scene of „Ossian's Dream“) was a sell-out at the [[Paris Opera]] in 1804, and transformed the composer's career. The poems also exerted an influence on the burgeoning of [[Romantic music]], and [[Franz Schubert]] in particular composed [[Lieder]] setting many of Ossian's poems. In 1829 [[Felix Mendelssohn]] was inspired to visit the Hebrides and composed the ''[[Hebrides Overture]]'', better known as ''Fingal's Cave''. His friend [[Niels Gade]] devoted his first published work, the concert overture ''Efterklange af Ossian'' ("Echoes of Ossian") written in 1840, to the same subject.

Of all the admirers of Macpherson’s Ossian, perhaps one of those most qualified to judge its poetic quality{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} (as opposed to the question of its authenticity) was the great Hungarian national poet [[Sándor Petőfi]]. He went so far as to write a poem entitled ''Homer and Ossian'', of which the first verse reads:

&lt;poem&gt;
''Oh where are you Hellenes and Celts?
''Already you have vanished, like
''Two cities drowning
''In the waters of the deep.
''Only the tips of towers stand out from the water,
''Two tips of towers: Homer, Ossian.&lt;/poem&gt;

Likewise, [[William Wordsworth]] was evidently positively impressed by Macpherson's text when he wrote his poem ''Glen-Almain, the Narrow Glen'':&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Treasury'',Francis T. Palgrave.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
''In this still place, remote from men,
''Sleeps Ossian, in the Narrow Glen;
''In this still place, where murmurs on
''But one meek streamlet, only one:
''He sang of battles, and the breath
''Of stormy war, and violent death;
''And should, methinks, when all was past,
''Have rightfully be laid at last
''Where rocks were rudely heap'd, and rent
''As by a spirit turbulent;
''Where sights were rough, and sounds were wild,
''And everything unreconciled;
''In some complaining dim retreat,
''For fear and melancholy meet;
''But this is calm; there cannot be
''A more entire tranquility.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
''Does then the bard sleep here indeed?
''Or is it but a groundless creed?
''What matters it? – I blame them not
''Whose fancy in this lonely spot
''Was moved; and in such way express'd
''Their notion of its perfect rest.
''A convent, even a hermit's cell,
''Would break the silence of this Dell:
''It is not quiet, is not ease;
''But something deeper far than these:
''The separation that is here
''Is of the grave; and of austere
''Yet happy feelings of the dead:
''And therefore, was it rightly said
''That Ossian, last of all his race!
''Lies buried in this lonely place.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Authenticity debate==
[[File:François Pascal Simon Gérard 001.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Ossian Evoking ghosts on the Edge of the Lora'', by [[François Gerard|François Pascal Simon Gérard]], 1801]]

There were immediate disputes of Macpherson's claims on both literary and political grounds. Macpherson promoted a Scottish origin for the material, and was hotly opposed by Irish historians who felt that their heritage was being appropriated. However, both Scotland and Ireland shared a common [[Gaels|Gaelic]] culture during the period in which the poems are set, and some [[Fenian Cycle|Fenian]] literature common in both countries was composed in Scotland.

[[Samuel Johnson]], English author, critic, and biographer, was convinced that Macpherson was "a [[wikt:mountebank|mountebank]], a liar, and a fraud, and that the poems were forgeries".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Magnusson|2006|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson also dismissed the poems' quality. Upon being asked, "But Doctor Johnson, do you really believe that any man today could write such poetry?" he famously replied, "Yes. Many men. Many women. And many children." Johnson is cited as calling the story of Ossian "as gross an imposition as ever the world was troubled with".&lt;ref name="fagles"&gt;Introduction of Robert Fagles' translations of [[The Iliad]] and [[The Odyssey]]&lt;/ref&gt; In support of his claim, Johnson also called Gaelic the rude speech of a barbarous people, and said there were no manuscripts in it more than 100 years old. In reply, it was proved that the Advocates' library at Edinburgh contained Gaelic manuscripts 500 years old, and one of even greater antiquity.&lt;ref name=amcyc&gt;{{AmCyc|wstitle=Ossian|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish author [[Hugh Blair]]'s 1763 ''A Critical Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian'' upheld the work's authenticity against Johnson's scathing criticism and from 1765 was included in every edition of ''Ossian'' to lend the work credibility. The work also had a timely resonance for those swept away by the emerging [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] and the theory of the "[[noble savage]]", and it echoed the popularity of [[Edmund Burke|Burke's]] seminal ''[[A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful]]'' (1757).&lt;ref&gt;J. Buchan, ''Crowded with Genius'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), {{ISBN|0-06-055888-1}}, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1766 the Irish antiquarian and Gaelic scholar [[Charles O'Conor (historian)|Charles O'Conor]] dismissed Ossian's authenticity in a new chapter ''Remarks on Mr. Mac Pherson's translation of Fingal and Temora'' that he added to the second edition of his seminal history.&lt;ref&gt;O'Conor, C. ''Dissertations on the ancient history of Ireland (1753) [http://www.exclassics.com/ossian/oconor.pdf (Copy at Ex-Classics)]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1775 he expanded his criticism in a new book, ''Dissertation on the origin and antiquities of the antient Scots''.

[[File:Ossian's Cave front, The Hermitage.JPG|left|thumb|upright=1.2|Ossian's Cave at [[The Hermitage (Scotland)|The Hermitage]] in [[Dunkeld]], Scotland]]

Faced with the controversy, the Committee of the [[Highland Society of London|Highland Society]] enquired after the authenticity of Macpherson's supposed original. It was because of these circumstances that the so-called [[Glenmasan manuscript]] (Adv. 72.2.3) came to light in the late 18th century, a compilation which contains the tale ''Oided mac n-Uisnig''. This text is a version of the Irish ''Longes mac n-Uislenn'' and offers a tale which bears some comparison to Macpherson's "Darthula", although it is radically different in many respects. Donald Smith cited it in his report for the Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Donald |last=MacKinnon |title=The Glenmasan Manuscript |journal=The Celtic Review |volume=1 |issue=6 |year=1905 |pages=3–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy raged on into the early years of the 19th century, with disputes as to whether the poems were based on Irish sources, on sources in English, on Gaelic fragments woven into his own composition as Johnson concluded,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.floridabibliophilesociety.org/Fingal.html |title=Lord Auchinleck's Fingal |publisher=Florida Bibliophile Society |accessdate=9 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726060119/http://www.floridabibliophilesociety.org/Fingal.html |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or largely on Scots Gaelic oral traditions and manuscripts as Macpherson claimed. Defences of the authenticity of the poems continued to be made. For example, [[Peter Hately Waddell]] argued in ''Ossian and the Clyde'' (1875) that poems contained topographical references that could not have been known to Macpherson.&lt;ref&gt;"Waddell, Peter Hately". Dictionary of National Biography. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co. 1885–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, the Scottish literary scholar [[Derick Thomson]] investigated the sources for Macpherson's work and concluded that Macpherson had collected genuine Scottish Gaelic [[ballads]], employing scribes to record those that were preserved orally and collating manuscripts, but had adapted them by altering the original characters and ideas, and had introduced a great deal of his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Derick |last=Thomson |title=The Gaelic Sources of Macpherson's 'Ossian' |year=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the strongest evidence that Macpherson's 'Ossian' was not a total fabrication is to be found in the oldest extant Scottish manuscript in Gaelic known as the ''[[Book of the Dean of Lismore]]'' (1512).{{original research inline|date=June 2017}} In the section of this manuscript which consists of heroic poetry and includes verse from as early as AD 1310, we find the names and exploits of almost all the leading protagonists in Macpherson's text (Cairbe, Caoilte, Conán, Cormac mac Airt, Cú Chulainn, Diarmad, Eimhear, Fionn mac Cumhaill, Goll mac Morna, Osgar mac Oiséin, Tréanmhor, etc.), together with legends and traditions associated with these characters. (See 'Heroic Poetry from the Book of the Dean of Lismore'. Neil Ross, editor. Scottish Gaelic Texts Society, Edinburgh, 1939.)

==Ossian and Gaelic printing==
{{original research section|date=June 2017}}

Macpherson’s ''Ossian'' made a strong impression on  [[Dugald Buchanan]] (1716–68), a Perthshire poet whose celebrated ''Spiritual Hymns'' are written in a Scots Gaelic of a high quality that to some extent reflects the language of the classical Gaelic common to the bards of both Ireland and Scotland.  Buchanan, taking the poems of ''Ossian'' to be authentic,  was moved to revalue the genuine traditions and rich cultural heritage of the Gaels. At around the same time, he wrote to [[Sir James Clerk, 3rd Baronet|Sir James Clerk of Penicuik]], the leading antiquary of the movement, proposing that someone should travel to the Isles and Western Coast of Scotland  and collect the work of the ancient and modern bards, in which alone he could find the language in its purity.

Much later, in the 19th and 20th centuries, this task was taken up by collectors such as  [[Alexander Carmichael]]&lt;ref&gt;''Carmina Gadelica'', Alexander Carmichael, printed by T. &amp; A. Constable, Edinburgh, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lady Evelyn Stewart Murray]],&lt;ref&gt;''Tales from Highland Perthshire'', collected by Lady Evelyn Stewart Murray, translated and edited by Sylvia Robertson and Tony Dilworth, Scottish Gaelic Texts Society, Volume 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and to be recorded and continued by the work of the [[School of Scottish Studies]] and the Scottish Gaelic Texts Society.  It can perhaps be claimed,{{weasel inline|date=June 2017}} therefore, that the effect  made on Dugald Buchanan by his reading of Macpherson’s ''Ossian'' led eventually to the availability of printed books  in Gaelic (other than solely religious material) from the later years of the 19th century, and to the emergence of a mature body of literature in the 20th and 21st.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==In art==
Subjects from the Ossian poems were popular in the art of northern Europe, but at rather different periods depending on the country; by the time French artists began to depict Ossian, British artists had largely dropped him.  Ossian was especially popular in [[Danish art]], but also found in Germany and the rest of Scandinavia.

===Britain, Germany and Scandinavia===
British artists began to depict the Ossian poems early on, with the first major work a cycle of paintings decorating the ceiling the "Grand Hall" of [[Penicuik House]] in [[Midlothian]], built by [[Clerk Baronets|Sir James Clerk]], who commissioned the paintings in 1772.  These were by the Scottish painter [[Alexander Runciman]] and lost when the house burnt down in 1899, though drawings and [[etching]]s survive, and two pamphlets describing them were published in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Okun, 331–334&lt;/ref&gt;  A subject from Ossian by [[Angelica Kauffman]] was shown in the [[Royal Academy]] exhibition of 1773, and Ossian was depicted in ''Elysium'', part of the Irish painter [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]]'s ''magnum opus'' decorating the [[Royal Society of Arts]], at the [[Adelphi Buildings]] in London (still ''in situ'').&lt;ref&gt;Okun, 334–335&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fingal.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Fingal Sees the Ghosts of His Ancestors in the Moonlight'', [[Nicolai Abildgaard]], 1778]]

Works on paper by [[Thomas Girtin]] and [[John Sell Cotman]] have survived, though the Ossianic landscapes by George Augustus Wallis, which the Ossian fan [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]] praised in a letter to Goethe, seem to have been lost, as has a picture by [[J.M.W. Turner]] exhibited in 1802.  [[Henry Singleton (painter)|Henry Singleton]] exhibited paintings, some of which were engraved and used in editions of the poems.&lt;ref&gt;Okun, 336–338&lt;/ref&gt;

A fragment by [[Novalis]], written in 1789, refers to Ossian as an inspired, holy and poetical singer.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, 976&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish painter [[Nicolai Abildgaard]], Director of the [[Copenhagen Academy]] from 1789, painted several scenes from Ossian, as did his pupils including [[Asmus Jacob Carstens]].&lt;ref&gt;Okun, 339–341&lt;/ref&gt;  His friend [[Joseph Anton Koch]] painted a number of subjects, and two large series of illustrations for the poems, which never got properly into print; like many Ossianic works by Wallis, Carstens, Krafft and others, some of these were painted in Rome, perhaps not the best place to evoke the dim northern light of the poems. In Germany the request in 1804 to produce some drawings as illustrations so excited [[Philipp Otto Runge]] that he planned a series of 100, far more than asked for, in a style heavily influenced by the linear illustrations of [[John Flaxman]]; these remain as drawings only.&lt;ref&gt;Okun, 338–345&lt;/ref&gt;  Many other German works are recorded, some as late as the 1840s;&lt;ref&gt;Okun, 335–346&lt;/ref&gt; word of the British scepticism over the Ossian poems was slow to pentetrate the continent, or considered irrelevant.

===France===
[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 001.jpg|thumb|left|''Ossian Receiving the Ghosts of Fallen French Heroes'', [[Anne-Louis Girodet]], 1805]]

In France the enthusiasm of Napoleon for the poems accounts for most artistic depictions, and those by the most famous artists, but a painting exhibited in the [[Paris Salon]] in 1800 by [[Paul Duqueylar]] (now [[Musée Granet]], [[Aix-en-Provence]]) excited ''Les Barbus'' ("the Bearded Ones") a group of primitivist artists including [[Pierre-Maurice Quays]] (or Quaï) who promoted living in the style of "early civilizations as described in Homer, Ossian, and the Bible".&lt;ref&gt;Okun, 346–347&lt;/ref&gt;  Quays is reported as saying: "Homère? Ossian? ... le soleil? la lune? Voilà la question. En vérité, je crois que je préfère la lune. C'est plus simple, plus grand, plus ''primitif''". ("Homer? Ossian? ... the sun? the moon? That's the question. Truthfully I think I prefer the moon. It's more simple, more grand, more ''primitive''").&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, 383&lt;/ref&gt;  The same year Napoleon was planning the renovation of the [[Château de Malmaison]] as a summer palace, and though he does not seem to have suggested Ossianic subjects for his painters, two large and significant works were among those painted for the reception hall, for which six artists had been commissioned.

[[File:Ary Scheffer - Death of Malvina.jpg|thumb|''Malvina'' or ''The Death of Malvina'', by [[Ary Scheffer]] (see literature), c. 1802, musée Auguste Grasset, [[Varzy]]]]
[[File:Anne-Louis Girodet.jpg|thumb|left|Study by [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson|Girodet]] for his ''Ossian'' painting, 1801, [[Louvre]]]]

These were [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson|Girodet]]'s painting of 1801–02 ''Ossian receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes'', and ''Ossian Evoking ghosts on the Edge of the Lora'' (1801), by [[François Gérard|François Pascal Simon Gérard]]. Gérard's original was lost in a shipwreck after being bought by the King of Sweden after the fall of Napoleon, but survives in three replicas by the artist (a further one in Berlin was lost in 1945).  One is now at Malmaison (184.5 × 194.5&amp;nbsp;cm / 72.6 × 76.6 in), and the [[Kunsthalle Hamburg]] has another (180,5 × 198,5&amp;nbsp;cm). A [[watercolour]] copy by [[Jean-Baptiste Isabey]] was placed as [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] to Napoleon's copy of the poems.&lt;ref&gt;Okun, 347–348; Rubin throughout, and pp. 384–386 on the variety of titles by which the work has been known; [http://www.musees-nationaux-napoleoniens.org/pages/page_id19162_u1l2.htm Château de Malmaison] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705234627/http://www.musees-nationaux-napoleoniens.org/pages/page_id19162_u1l2.htm |date=5 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duqueylar, Girodet and Gérard, like [[Johann Peter Krafft]] (above) and most of the ''Barbus'', were all pupils of [[Jacques-Louis David|David]], and the clearly unclassical subjects of the Ossian poems were useful for emergent French Romantic painting, marking a revolt against David's [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] choice of historical subject-matter. David's recorded reactions to the paintings were guarded or hostile; he said of Girodet's work: "Either Girodet is mad or I no longer know anything of the art of painting".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 184–190, 187 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

Girodet's painting (still at Malmaison; 192.5 x 184&amp;nbsp;cm) was a ''success de scandale'' when exhibited in 1802, and remains a key work in the emergence of French Romantic painting, but the specific allusions to the political situation that he intended it to carry were largely lost on the public, and overtaken by the [[Peace of Amiens]] with Great Britain, signed in 1802 between the completion and exhibition of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Okun, 349–351; [http://www.musees-nationaux-napoleoniens.org/pages/page_id19164_u1l2.htm  Chateau de Malmaison] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905195833/http://www.musees-nationaux-napoleoniens.org/pages/page_id19164_u1l2.htm |date=5 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also produced ''Malvina dying in the arms of Fingal'' (c. 1802), and other works.

Another pupil of David, [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], was to depict Ossianic scenes over most of his long career. He made a drawing in 1809, when studying in Rome, and in 1810 or 1811 was commisissioned to make two paintings, the ''Dream of Ossian'' and a classical scene, to decorate the bedroom Napoleon was to occupy in the [[Palazzo Quirinale]] on a visit to Rome.  In fact the visit never came off and in 1835 Ingres repurchased the work, now in poor condition.

===Message===
The message of the concert, according to U.S. representative Jim McGovern, was to circumvent [[politician]]s, and using the medium of music, speak directly to young people and encourage them to think in fresh ways — to change their way of thinking — and leave behind the old politics, the old [[hatred]]s, [[prejudice]]s and national enmities that have locked too many people into patterns of [[Group conflict|conflict]], [[violence]], [[poverty]] and despair, dividing them from one another. It was an attempt to break down barriers and ask people to join in common purpose.&lt;ref name = psf2 /&gt;

{{quote|"We are here for the music and it is a message of peace and unity, not only for Cuba, but for the entire region."| [[Juanes]],&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;}}

Many of the 1.5 million patrons wore white to symbolize peace.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; The BBC's Michael Voss, who was at the five-and-a-half hour concert, said there was a mood of excitement as many residents of the isolated, music-loving island had never seen anything like it before.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

===U.S. reactions===
{{quote|"My understanding is that he's a terrific musician. He puts on a very good concert. I certainly don't think it hurts U.S.-Cuban relations, these kinds of cultural exchanges."| U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], September 20, 2009&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i9DVYEgKgapjAMnSjASpDxEudgUA Huge Crowds Gather in Havana for Peace Concert] &lt;/ref&gt; }}

Both the [[United States]] and Cuban governments helped facilitate the concert, including providing Juanes and his company of 15 international and Cuban artists full control over message and staging. The Departments of State, [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]] and [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce]], and especially [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]], provided various licenses and authorities required for U.S. musicians, technicians, musical and production equipment to travel to Cuba.&lt;ref name = psf2 /&gt;

===Controversies===
A small vocal group of [[Cuban exile]]s in Miami protested the concert charging that it would service the PR campaign of the  Communistic Castro government. The location of the Havana concert was also seen as possibly symbolic by Cuban exiles, as Revolution Square features the headquarters of the [[Cuban Communist Party]] along with a giant metal sculpture of [[Che Guevara]]'s face.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Various demonstrations were staged in South Florida, where  some destroyed CDs from Juanes publicly by running them over with a steam roller.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Juanes also received death threats from Miami-based critics of the Cuban regime.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8265177.stm Cuba Rocks to Huge Peace Concert] by ''[[BBC News]]'', September 21 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Before and after the performance, Juanes stated that his "Peace Without Borders" concert is not about politics but reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/20/AR2009092000765.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to William Booth from the [[Washington Post]], whose following commentary is now part of the Congressional Record, "Tanon shouted that she brought greetings from Miami — home of many Cuban exiles who live in opposition to the Cuban government — and no one in the crowd booed, but instead whistled and cheered".&lt;ref name = psf2 /&gt;

The concert was used by [[Hugo Chávez]] during his speech at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] of September 24, 2009 to criticize the Cuban exiles in Miami for destroying Juanes' CDs in protest.

The '''Polish–Romanian Alliance''' was a series of [[treaty|treaties]] signed in the [[interwar period]] by the [[Second Polish Republic]] and the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. The first of them was signed in 1921 and, together, the treaties formed a basis for good [[International relations|foreign relations]] between the two countries that lasted until [[World War II]] began in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Ragsdale&lt;/ref&gt;

==European context==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Bolsheviks enter odessa.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Red Army]] entering [[Odessa]] in February 1920]] --&gt;
Immediately after [[World War I]], the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|peace treaties]] recognized the reestablishment of a Polish state for the [[partitions of Poland|first time in over 100 years]]. Romania emerged from the war as a victorious nation, enlarging its territory (as ''[[Greater Romania]]''). Both states had serious reasons to stand by these treaties.

Having established contacts with Poland in January–February 1919 (after [[Stanisław Głąbiński]]'s visit to [[Bucharest]]),&lt;ref name="Mareş"&gt;Mareş&lt;/ref&gt; Romania oriented itself towards a ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' alliance aimed at [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]] and the newly created [[Comintern]]; the proclamation of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], the [[German Revolution|German insurrection]], and the [[Red Army]]'s capture of [[Odessa]]&lt;ref name="Anghel, 1918-1920...; Mareş"&gt;Anghel, "1918-1920..."; Mareş&lt;/ref&gt; alarmed politicians in both countries. The diplomat [[Czesław Pruszyński]] reported to the Polish government: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A dam that can put a stop to Bolshevik pressure on the West is constituted of Poland to the north, and Romania to the south. [...] There is a natural necessity, but also a historical necessity, that, based on the mutual interests of Romania and Poland, a military alliance be sealed in front of the common threat facing them."&lt;ref name="Pruszyński, in Mareş"&gt;Pruszyński, in Mareş&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Romania was not engaged in the [[Polish-Soviet War]], but accepted and supported Polish military transit through its territory.  According to another of Pruszyński's reports, Romania facilitated the transit of Polish nationals from Russia to their native areas, as well as furnishing armament and grain at preferential prices.&lt;ref name="Pruszyński, in Mareş"/&gt; In this context, the [[Romanian Army]] intervened in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]] against the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] (created in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] in the summer of that year), helping the Poles in [[Pokuttya]] (''see [[Romanian occupation of Pokuttya]]'').&lt;ref name="Anghel, 1918-1920...; Mareş"/&gt;

Count [[Aleksander Skrzyński]], acting with the acknowledgement of Polish leaders [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] and [[Józef Piłsudski]], extended an offer to the Romanian government of [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]] to participate in the future administration of [[Ukraine]] in its entirety (August 1919); the message was again stated after Skrzyński became ambassador in Romania the following month.&lt;ref name="Anghel, 1918-1920"&gt;Anghel, "1918-1920..."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexandru G. Florescu]], the ambassador to [[Warsaw]], reported back that the plan for a common military administration was: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] an inaccuracy and a fantasy which I suppose one should not take into account for anything other than making stock of them."&lt;ref&gt;Florescu, September 1919, in Anghel, "1918-1920..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Agreeing with Florescu's assessment, the Brătianu cabinet expressed a will to establish contacts with the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].&lt;ref name="Anghel, 1918-1920"/&gt; In 1920, a similar plan was proposed by Piłsudski himself to the [[Alexandru Averescu]] government; the offer was more specific, indicating that Romania was to extend its administration to the east (the [[Black Sea]] shore, Odessa, and [[Transnistria]]).&lt;ref name="Anghel, 1918-1920"/&gt; Averescu refused to accept the proposal, as it meant his country's involvement in the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Anghel, 1918-1920"/&gt;

==The first treaty==
[[Image:Rzeczpospolita 1920 captioned.png|thumb|350px|Poland in 1922; northern areas of Romania visible to the south]]
The first treaty was the Convention on Defensive Alliance, signed on March 3, 1921 in Bucharest. The treaty, concluded for a period of five years, committed both parties to rendering armed assistance to one another "in case one of the sides is attacked at its present Eastern frontiers".&lt;ref name="Osmanczyk"&gt;Osmanczyk&lt;/ref&gt; and was aimed at containing Russia (from 1922, the [[Soviet Union]]), which had just lost the Polish-Soviet War.&lt;ref name="Osmanczyk"/&gt; Among the diplomats engaged in negotiations were Polish general [[Tadeusz Rozwadowski]] and Romanian general [[Ion Antonescu]].&lt;ref name="Mareş"/&gt; Ratifications for that treaty were exchanged in Bucharest on July 25, 1921. The treaty was registered in ''League of Nations [[Treaty Series]]'' on October 24 of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 7, pp. 78-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1920s, Romania, along with [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], initiated the [[Little Entente]]. The alliance's primary goal was to counter [[Hungary]]'s [[revanchism]], which involved Romania's [[Transylvania]]. Romania's [[List of Romanian Foreign Ministers|Foreign Minister]], [[Take Ionescu]], was unable to bring Poland and [[Greece]] into the alliance because of [[border conflicts between Poland and Czechoslovakia|border disagreements]] between Poland and Czechoslovakia. The Romanian representative in [[Warsaw]] reported: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Poland's policy towards the Little Entente [...] becomes clearer. Poland will not wish to join it. [...] This attitude may be related to Mr. [[Edvard Beneš|Beneš]]'s, who seems to have declared that Poland's joining the treaty is not currently possible."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexandru G. Florescu]], August 13, 1923, in Preda&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in 1925, the [[Locarno Treaties]] were signed in which [[Germany]] committed to preserve the ''[[status quo]]'' in the [[Rhineland]]. Germany also signed [[arbitration]] conventions with Poland and Czechoslovakia, but the Polish government felt betrayed by [[France]].
[[Image:Romania MASSR 1920.png|thumb|300px|Greater Romania (1920-1940)]]

Under the circumstances, the Polish-Romanian treaty's renewal was discussed in the early months of 1926. The Romanian foreign minister, [[Ion G. Duca]], wrote in a telegram to the Romanian ambassador in France:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Our treaty with Poland expires on the 3rd of March. The Poles will not renew it in the present form, as they have to take into account the atmosphere created by the [[League of Nations]] and the Locarno Treaties. They also do not want to keep an exclusively anti-Russian treaty [...] Poland wishes to obtain our help in case it were attacked by Germany."&lt;ref&gt;Telegram from Ion G. Duca to [[Constantin I. Diamandy]], February 4, 1926, in Preda&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Further treaties==
[[File:MiguelDeRumaníaYJozefBeckEnVarsovia1937.jpeg|thumb|right|Crown Prince [[Michael of Romania]] with Polish Foreign Minister [[Józef Beck]] in Warsaw, 24 May 1937.]]

On March 26, 1926, Poland and Romania signed a ''Treaty of Alliance'' to bolster security in [[Eastern Europe]].[http://www.indiana.edu/~league/1926.htm] It was directed against any attack, not just one coming from the Soviet Union. Ratifications were exchanged in Warsaw on February 9, 1927. The treaty was registered in the ''League of Nations Treaty Series'' on March 7, 1927.&lt;ref&gt;''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 60, pp. 162-167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention was replaced by the Treaty on Mutual Assistance against Aggression and on Military Aid, signed on February 9, 1927 in [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref name="Osmanczyk"/&gt;

In both countries, political changes were taking place. The [[King of Romania]], [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] died in 1927, leaving the throne to his young grandson, [[Mihai I of Romania|MihaiI]]. A [[regent|regency]] took over the administration of the monarchic institution until the 1930 takeover of [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]].

In Poland, the [[Sanacja]] movement took the power after the [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]], marking the beginning of the Piłsudski's leadership. On January 15, 1931, Poland and Romania signed a Guarantee Treaty.&lt;ref name="Osmanczyk"/&gt; Around October, rumours in Poland that Piłsudski was considering [[Prince Nicholas of Romania|Prince Nicholas]], Romania's former regent, for the vacant [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish throne]] were encouraged by [[conservatism|conservative]] politicians, such as [[Janusz Radziwiłł (1880-1967)|Janusz Radziwiłł]]. During the Polish leader's visit to Romania in that month, Radziwiłł spoke in the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] about the possibility of a monarchic revival. That was interpreted by [[Zdzisław Lubomirski]] to be the result of "an indication coming from [Piłsudski]".&lt;ref&gt;Lubomirski, in Anghel, "Mareşalul Piłsudski...", p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1932, [[Adolf Hitler]] was the leader of the most popular political party in Germany. Therefore, Poland tried to secure its eastern border by negotiating a treaty with the Soviets and by signing a [[Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]]. Romania could not do the same, however, as the Soviets had not recognized the Soviet-Romanian border on the [[Dniester]] and Romania's rule over [[Bessarabia]]. In the same year, the [[Romanian prime minister]], [[Nicolae Iorga]], was informed by the ambassador in Warsaw, [[Grigore Bilciurescu]], that conservative groups were considering the possibility of a [[personal union]], with Carol as king of both countries.&lt;ref name="Anghel p.75"&gt;Anghel, "Mareşalul Piłsudski...", p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations became colder as their interests diverged. Romania created the [[Balkan Pact]] in 1934, together with Yugoslavia, [[Turkey]] and Greece.

Under the premiership of [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]] (1934–1937), Romania's attempt to balance its alliances with Poland and Czechoslovakia was put to the test by a political scandal. [[Jan Šeba]], the Czechoslovak ambassador to [[Bucharest]], published a volume that supported a rapprochement between the Soviet Union and the Little Entente and was prefaced by the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister [[Kamil Krofta]]. In early 1937, Krofta denied knowledge of the book's content and, after Tătărescu visited [[Milan Hodža]], his counterpart in [[Prague]], Šeba was recalled.&lt;ref&gt;Otu&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Tătărescu met with Polish [[Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland|Foreign Minister]] [[Józef Beck]] in Bucharest. Beck, who had previously opposed the [[status quo]] policies of [[Nicolae Titulescu]],&lt;ref name="Anghel p.75"/&gt; unsuccessfully proposed a Romanian withdrawal of its support for Czechoslovakia and an attempt to reach a compromise with Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, p.432-433&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, in the wake of the Czechoslovak crisis, Beck urged the Romanian government of [[Miron Cristea]], formed by the [[National Renaissance Front]], to participate at the partition of Czechoslovakia (the [[Munich Agreement]]), by supporting Hungary's [[annexation]] of [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]. He hoped that Hungary's [[Miklós Horthy]] would no longer sustain claims over Transylvania. However, the offer was refused by Carol Carol II.

As the situation was becoming increasingly volatile in the eve of World War II, the two countries began improving their relations. In 1938, [[Richard Franasovici]], the Romanian ambassador in Warsaw, reported:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[There is] an obvious improvement of Poland's sentiments towards Romania [...]. The main idea here is maintaining, above everything, the alliance with Romania, of course, due to the growing pressure from [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], as well as due to the desire to not be completely isolated in the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] problem [...] Also, [the Poles] consider that the German influence in [[Budapest]] and [[Prague]] is too powerful [...]."&lt;ref&gt;Franasovici, December 16, 1938, in Preda&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both countries soon offered each other assistance. After the partition of Czechoslovakia, Romania feared being next. Ambassador Franasovici reported in March 1939 that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] as with their appeasing intervention in Budapest, the Polish government pointed out that any action of Hungary against Romania could lead to a new world war, and guaranteed Romania's peaceful intentions."&lt;ref&gt;Franasovici, in Preda&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The annulment of Polish-Romanian treaties was one of the Soviet demands during prewar French, [[United Kingdom|British]], Polish and Soviet negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Lukowski &amp; Zawadzki, p.224&lt;/ref&gt;

Polish diplomacy also secured British guarantees to Romania in the [[Polish-British Common Defense Pact]] of 1939. Diplomats and strategists in Poland viewed the alliance with Romania as an important part of Polish foreign and defense policy, but it eventually proved to be mostly irrelevant. Immediately preceding the war, Poland and Romania avoided specifically aiming their agreements against Germany, a country with which both were still seeking a compromise, as Beck and [[Grigore Gafencu]] agreed in the April 1939 negotiations in [[Kraków]].&lt;ref&gt;Prazmowska, p.69-70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outbreak of World War II==
After the [[Polish September Campaign|German invasion of Poland]] on September 1, Poland declined Romanian military assistance but expected to receive assistance from its British and French allies through Romanian ports; thus the reason for the [[Romanian Bridgehead]] plan.

After the [[Red Army]] joined the German attack on September 17, 1939, with [[Western betrayal|Western assistance not forthcoming]], the Polish high command abandoned the plan and ordered its units to evacuate to France. Many units went through Romanian borders, where they were [[internment|interned]], but Romania remained friendly towards Poles, allowing many soldiers to escape from the camps and to move to France. Romania also treated interned Polish soldiers and immigrants but with relative respect throughout the war even after it [[Romania during World War II|joined the Axis in 1941]].&lt;ref&gt;Baliszewski; Peszke; Włodarkiewicz&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a result of German pressure, Romania could not openly aid the Poles.&lt;ref&gt;Cave &amp; Paczkowski, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 1939, the pro-British prime minister of Romania, [[Armand Călinescu]], was killed in [[Bucharest]] by a squad of local [[fascism|fascist]] activists of the [[Iron Guard]], with German support. Immediately afterwards, German authorities issued [[propaganda]] blaming the action on Polish and British initiative.&lt;ref name="Ignat &amp; Matei, p.76"&gt;Ignat &amp; Matei, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the Nazi journalist [[Hans Fritzsche]] attributed the assassination to Polish and British resentments over Romania's failure to intervene in the war.&lt;ref name="Ignat &amp; Matei, p.76"/&gt;

==Diplomatic alternatives==
Though some politicians, such as Poland's [[Józef Piłsudski]], who had proposed the [[Międzymorze]] federation at the end of [[World War I]] had attempted to forge a grand coalition of [[Central Europe|Central]], [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Balkans|Balkan]] European states, a series of conflicts there had prevented the establishment of anything but a series of smaller, mostly [[bilateralism|bilateral]], treaties.

Poland, for example, had good relations with [[Latvia]], Romania, Hungary and France (with the [[Franco-Polish Military Alliance]]) but poor relations with [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]] and [[Lithuania]] (after the [[Polish-Lithuanian War]]). Hungary had similar tensions with both Romania and Czechoslovakia. Such conflicts had prevented Poland and Hungary from joining the Little Entente. Over the next two decades, the region's political arena had been largely dominated by treaties and alliances similar to the Polish–Romanian Alliance.

{{Campaignbox First Italian War of Independence}}
The '''Roman Republic''' was a short-lived state declared on 9 February 1849, when the government of [[Papal States]] was temporarily replaced by a republican government due to [[Pope Pius IX]]'s flight to [[Gaeta]].  The republic was led by [[Carlo Armellini]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], and [[Aurelio Saffi]].  Together they formed a [[triumvirate]], a reflection of a form of government seen in the ancient [[Roman Republic]].

One of the major innovations the Republic hoped to achieve was enshrined in its constitution: [[Freedom of religion|all religions could be practiced freely]] and the [[Pope Pius IX|pope]] was guaranteed the right to govern the [[Catholic Church]]. These religious freedoms were quite different from the situation under the preceding government, which allowed only Catholicism and [[Judaism]] to be practiced by citizens. The Constitution of the Roman Republic was the first in the world to abolish [[capital punishment]] in its [[constitutional law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Art. 5. — Le pene di morte e di confisca sono proscritte |trans-title=The penalties of death and confiscation are proscribed |url=http://www.liberliber.it/mediateca/libri/r/repubblica_romana_1849/costituzione_della_repubblica_etc/pdf/costit_p.pdf |work=Costituzione Della Repubblica Romana |date=1849 |language=Italian |accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Birth of the Republic===
On 15 November 1848, [[Pellegrino Rossi]], the [[Politics of the Vatican City#Judicial branch|Minister of Justice]] of the [[Papal States|Papal government]], was assassinated. The following day, the liberals of [[Rome]] filled the streets, where various groups demanded a democratic government, [[social reform]]s and  a declaration of war against the [[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]]. On the night of 24 November, [[Pope Pius IX]] left Rome disguised as an ordinary [[priest]], and went out of the state to [[Gaeta]], a fortress in the [[Two Sicilies|Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Before leaving he had allowed the formation of a government led by Archbishop [[Carlo Emanuele Muzzarelli]], to whom he wrote a note before leaving:
{{blockquote|We entrust to your known prudence and honesty to inform the minister Galletti, engaging him with all the other ministers not only to defend the palaces, but especially the persons near you that did not know [[Royal we|Our]] decision.  Because not only you and your family are dear to Our heart, We repeat they did not know Our thinking, but much more We recommend to those Sirs tranquillity and order of the whole City.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}}}

The government issued some liberal reforms which Pius IX rejected and when securely established in Gaeta he designed a new government. A delegation was created by the High Council established by the Pope and the mayor of Rome, and sent to reassure the Pope and ask him to come back as soon as possible. This delegation was composed of the mayor himself, Prince Tommaso Corsini, three priests &amp;ndash; Rezzi, Mertel and Arrighi &amp;ndash; Marchese Paolucci de Calboli, doctor Fusconi and lawyer Rossi. However, they were stopped at the state boundary at [[Terracina]].  The Pope, informed of this, refused to speak to them. In Rome a ''Costituente Romana'' was formed, 29 November. 
[[Image:Mazzini.jpg|thumb|left|[[Giuseppe Mazzini]]]]
Without a [[local government]] in Rome, for the first time in history, popular assemblies gathered. [[Margaret Fuller]] described the procession under a new flag, a ''[[Flag of Italy|tricolore]]'' sent from Venice, that set the flag in the hands of the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius|equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius]] at the [[Campidoglio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Leona |last=Rostenberg |authorlink=Leona Rostenberg |title=Margaret Fuller's Roman Diary |journal=[[The Journal of Modern History]] |volume=12 |issue=2 |date=June 1940 |page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the angry popular reaction to papal warnings of [[excommunication]] for political actions of November received from Gaeta and posted on the 3rd.&lt;ref&gt;"An astonishment in this age" was the progressive Margaret Fuller's reaction (Rostenberg 1940:213)&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Costituenti'' decided to schedule direct and universal elections (electors were all the citizens of the State, male and over 21 years old) on the following 21 January 1849. Since the pope had forbidden Catholics to vote at those elections (he considered the convocation of the election "a monstrous act of felony made without a mask by the sponsors of the anarchic demagogy", an "abnormal and sacrilegious attempt... deserving the punishments written both in the divine and the human laws"), the resulting constitutional assembly (informally known as "The Assembly of the Damned")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url= http://www.revolutionspodcast.com/2018/03/731-the-assembly-of-the-damned.html |title= Revolutions|host= Mike Duncan|date= 17 March 2018|access-date= 27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; had a republican inclination. In each and every part of the Papal States more than 50% of the potential voters went to the polls.

[[Image:Saffi.jpg|thumb|Aurelio Saffi.]]

The voters were not asked to express themselves on the parties but to vote for individuals. The lawyer [[Francesco Sturbinetti]], who had led the Council of the Deputies, received the most votes, followed by [[Carlo Armellini]], the physician [[Pietro Sterbini]], [[Carlo Emanuele Muzzarelli|monsignor Muzzarelli]], in whose hands Pius had left the city and [[Charles Lucien Bonaparte|Carlo Luciano Bonaparte, prince of Canino]]. The aristocracy was represented with a prince, six marquises, fifteen counts and three other nobles. The new assembly was dominated by the bourgeoisie, the affluent, professionals and employees. It included twenty-seven owners, a banker, fifty-three jurists and lawyers, six graduates, twelve professors, two writers, twenty-one doctors, one pharmacist, six engineers, five employees, two merchants, nineteen military officers, one prior and one monsignore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fracassi|first=Claudio |title=La Meravigliosa Storia della Repubblica dei Briganti |location=Rome |year=1849 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 1849, at a political rally held in the [[Tor di Nona|Teatro Apollo]], a young Roman ex-priest, the [[Abbé Arduini]], made a speech in which he declared that the [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]] of the popes was a "historical lie, a political imposture, and a religious immorality."&lt;ref name=ridley268&gt;{{cite book |first=Jasper |last=Ridley |authorlink=Jasper Ridley |title=Garibaldi |page=268 |year=1976 |location=New York |publisher=Viking Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitutional Assembly convened on 8 February and proclaimed the ''Roman Republic'' after midnight on 9 February. According to Jasper Ridley: "When the name of [[Charles Lucien Bonaparte|Carlo Luciano Bonaparte]], who was a member for Viterbo, was called, he replied to the roll-call by calling out ''Long live the Republic!''" (''Viva la Repubblica!'').&lt;ref name=ridley268/&gt; That a Roman Republic was a foretaste of wider expectations was expressed in the acclamation of [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] as a Roman citizen.

[[Image:Rossetti - Proclamazione della Repubblica Romana, nel 1849, in Piazza del Popolo - 1861.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Proclamation of the Roman Republic in 1849, in Piazza del Popolo]]

When news reached the city of the decisive defeat of Piedmontese forces at the [[Battle of Novara (1849)|Battle of Novara]] (22 March), the Assembly proclaimed the ''[[Triumvirate]]'', of [[Carlo Armellini]] (Roman), [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] (Roman) and [[Aurelio Saffi]] (from [[Teramo]], Papal States), and a government, led by Muzzarelli and composed also by [[Aurelio Saffi]] (from [[Forlì]], Papal States). Among the first acts of the Republic was the proclamation of the right of the Pope to continue his role as head of the Roman Church. The Triumvirate passed popular legislation to eliminate burdensome taxes and to give work to the unemployed.

[[Image:Garibaldi.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Giuseppe Garibaldi.]]

[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] formed the "Italian Legion", with many recruits coming from [[Piedmont]] and the Austrian territories of [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia|Lombardy and Venetia]], and took up a station at the border town of [[Rieti]] on the border with the Kingdom of Two Sicilies. There the legion rose to about 1000 and gained discipline and organization.

The Pope asked for military help from Catholic countries. Saliceti and Montecchi left the Triumvirate; their places were filled on 29 March by Saffi and [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], the Genoese founder of the journal ''[[Young Italy (historical)|La Giovine Italia]]'', who had been the guiding spirit of the Republic from the start. Mazzini won friends among the poor by confiscating some of the Church's large landholdings and distributing them to peasants. He inaugurated prison and insane asylum reforms, [[freedom of the press]], and [[secular education]], but shied away from the "Right to Work," having seen this measure fail in France.

[[File:Garibaldi Captures four French Guns at Rome.jpg|thumb|150px|Garibaldi capturing four French guns at Rome. Illustration from ''The Life and Times of Garibaldi'', published by [[Sir Walter Scott, 1st Baronet, of Beauclerc|Walter Scott]].]]
However, the government's policies (lower taxes, increased spending) meant the government had trouble with its finances and had to resort to inflating the currency in order to pay its debts. Runaway inflation might have doomed the Republic entirely on its own, but it also faced military threats.

Piedmont was at risk of attack by Austrian forces, and the Republic's movement of troops in the area was a threat to Austria (which was certainly capable of attacking Rome itself). The commander-in-chief of Austrian forces in Milan, [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|count Joseph Radetzky]], had remarked during the "Five Glorious Days" of Milan, "Three days of blood will give us thirty years of peace".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Priscilla |last=Smith Robertson |title=Revolutions of 1848, a social history |location=[[Princeton, New Jersey]] |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=1952 |isbn=9780691007564 |page=331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But the Roman Republic would fall to another, unexpected enemy. In France, newly elected President [[Louis Napoleon]], who would soon declare himself emperor [[Napoleon III]], was torn. He himself had participated in an insurrection in the Papal States against the Pope in 1831, but at this point he was under intense pressure from [[Ultramontanism|ultramontane]] French Catholics, who had voted overwhelmingly for him. Though he hesitated to betray Italian liberals, he decided to send troops to restore the Pope.

===French siege{{Anchor|French siege}}===
[[Image:Napoleon-3.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The President of the [[French Second Republic]] Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, soon Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]].]]

On 25 April, some eight to ten thousand French troops under General [[Charles Oudinot]] landed at [[Civitavecchia]] on the coast northwest of Rome, while Spain sent 4&amp;nbsp;000 men under [[Fernando Fernández de Córdova]] to [[Gaeta]], where the Pope remained in his refuge.  The French sent a staff officer the next day to meet with Giuseppe Mazzini with a stiff assertion that the pope would be restored to power. The revolutionary Roman Assembly, amid thunderous shouts of "Guerra!, Guerra!", authorised Mazzini to resist the French by force of arms.

The French expected little resistance from the "usurpers". But republican resolve was stiffened by the charismatic [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s long-delayed triumphal entry into Rome at last, on 27 April, and by the arrival on 29 April of the Lombard [[Bersaglieri]], who had recently driven the Austrians from the streets of Milan with new tactics of house-to-house fighting. Hasty defenses were erected on the [[Janiculum]] wall, and the villas on the city's outskirts were garrisoned. On 30 April, Oudinot's out-of-date maps led him to march to a gate that had been walled up some time before. The first cannon-shot was mistaken for the noon-day gun, and the astonished French were beaten back by the fiercely anti-clerical Romans of [[Trastevere]], Garibaldi's legionaries and citizen-soldiers, who sent them back to the sea. But despite Garibaldi's urging, Mazzini was loath to follow up their advantage, as he had not expected an attack by the French and hoped that the Roman Republic could befriend the French Republic. The French prisoners were treated as ''ospiti della guerra'' and sent back with republican tracts citing the Article V of the most recent French constitution: "France respects foreign nationalities. Her might will never be employed against the liberty of any people".
[[Image:Pope Pius IX.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pope Pius IX.]]
As a result, Oudinot was able to regroup and await reinforcements; time proved to be on his side, and Mazzini's attempt at diplomacy proved fatal to the Roman Republic. A letter from Louis Napoleon encouraged Oudinot and assured him of French reinforcements. The French government sent [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] to negotiate a more formal ceasefire. Neapolitan troops sympathetic to the Papacy entered Roman Republic territory, and de Lesseps suggested that Oudinot's forces in their current position might protect the city from the converging approach of an Austrian army with the Neapolitan force: the Roman Triumvirate agreed.  Many Italians from outside the Papal States went to Rome to fight for the Republic: among them was [[Goffredo Mameli]], who had tried to form a common state joining Roman Republic and [[Tuscany]], and who died of a wound suffered in the defense of Rome.

The siege began in earnest on 1 June, and despite the resistance of the Republican army, led by Garibaldi, the French prevailed on 29 June. On 30 June the Roman Assembly met and debated three options: to surrender; to continue fighting in the streets of Rome; to retreat from Rome and continue the resistance from the [[Apennine mountains]]. Garibaldi made a speech in which he favoured the third option and then said: ''Dovunque saremo, colà sarà Roma.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=G. M. |last=Trevelyan |authorlink=G. M. Trevelyan |title=Garibaldi's Defence of the Roman Republic |publisher=Longmans |location=London, UK |year=1907 |page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Wherever we may be, there will be Rome").

A truce was negotiated on 1 July and on 2 July Garibaldi, followed by some 4&amp;nbsp;000 troops, withdrew from Rome for refuge in the neutral republic of [[San Marino]]. The French Army entered Rome on 3 July and reestablished the [[Holy See]]'s temporal power. In August Louis Napoleon issued a sort of manifesto in which he asked of Pius IX a general amnesty, a secularized administration, the establishment of the [[Napoleonic Code|Code Napoléon]], and in general a Liberal Government. Pius, from Gaeta, promised reforms that he declared ''[[motu proprio]]'', that is, of his own volition, not in answer to the French.

The Pope did not return to Rome itself until April 1850, since the French were considered liberals all the same, and the Pope would not return until assured of no French meddling in his affairs. French soldiers propped up the Papal administration in Rome until they were withdrawn at the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870, leading to the subsequent [[capture of Rome]] and annexation by the [[Kingdom of Italy]].

According to Raffaele De Cesare:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Roman question was the stone tied to Napoleon's feet — that dragged him into the abyss. He never forgot, even in August 1870, a month before Sedan, that he was a sovereign of a Catholic country, that he had been made emperor, and was supported by the votes of the conservatives and the influence of the clergy; and that it was his supreme duty not to abandon the pontiff. […] For twenty years Napoleon III had been the true sovereign of Rome, where he had many friends and relations […] Without him the [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]] would never have been reconstituted, nor, being reconstituted, would have endured."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0XcpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA449&amp;dq=%22the+last+days+of+papal+rome%22 |title=The Last Days of Papal Rome, 1850-1870 |last=De Cesare |first=Raffaele |year=1909 |location=London |publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Co. |pages=440-443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In popular culture==
In 1949 an Italian film, ''[[Cavalcade of Heroes]]'', was made to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of the Republic, although it was not released until the following year. It was directed by [[Mario Costa (director)|Mario Costa]] and starred [[Carla Del Poggio]] and [[Cesare Danova]].

[[Arthur Hugh Clough]]'s long poem ''Amours de Voyage'' takes place during the siege of Rome, with one character describing the fighting in letters to his friend.

The movie ''[[In the Name of the Sovereign People]]'', 1990, directed by [[Luigi Magni]], winner of the [[David di Donatello]], is dedicated to the Roman Republic and his protagonists.

The 2012 TV fiction ''[[Anita Garibaldi (miniseries)|Anita Garibaldi]]'', directed by [[Claudio Bonivento]].

''Follow My Black Plume'' is a juvenile historical novel by [[Geoffrey Trease]] set during the Republic, based on Trevalyn's account.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2060">'''Santa Cruz de Coya''' was a city established by the [[governor of Chile]] [[Martín García Oñez de Loyola]] on the site of the fort of [[Santa Cruz de Oñez]], in 1595.  It was named for his wife [[Beatriz Clara Coya]], a member of the royal Incan house.  The Mapuche called the city '''Millacoya''', meaning gold princess from the [[mapudungun]] ''milla'', gold and the [[Quechua languages|quechua]] ''coya'', princess.  

The city was near the confluence of the [[Biobío River|Bio-Bio]] and [[Laja River (Chile)|Laja River]]s on the right bank of the upper reach of the [[Rele River]] in [[Catiray]], ten kilometers south of the Bio Bio. The site was in an elevated location but with a shortage of water. Gold mines were located across the Rele on a stream called Millapoa. It had a population that supported three churches but it did not flourish.  It was abandoned soon after the [[Disaster of Curalaba]] and was destroyed by [[Pelantaro]] in February 1599.  Governor [[Alonso de Ribera]] attempted to rebuild it in a better site in 1601 closer to the Bio Bio and the forts of [[San Rosendo]], [[Chivicura(fort)|Chivicura]] and [[Jesus de Huenuraquí]]. However it was soon abandoned and a new town of [[Nuestra de Senora de Halle|Monterrey de la Frontera]] was founded by Ribera to the east at the mouth of the Rele in 1605.

'''Shark finning''' is the act of removing [[Fish fin#Cartilaginous fishes|fins]] from [[shark]]s and discarding the rest of the shark. The sharks are often still alive when discarded, but without their fins.&lt;ref&gt;Schindler, D.E., Essington, T.E., Kitchell, J.F., Boggs, C. and Hilborn, R. (2002) [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/wol1/doi/10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012%5B0735:SATFIO%5D2.0.CO;2/abstract "Sharks and tunas: fisheries impacts on predators with contrasting life histories"]. ''Ecological Applications'', '''12''' (3): 735–748. {{doi|10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[0735:SATFIO]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spiegel2000&gt;Spiegel, J. (2000) [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/bcic24&amp;div=22&amp;id=&amp;page= "Even Jaws deserves to keep his fins: outlawing shark finning throughout global waters"]. ''Boston College International and Comparative Law Review'', '''24''' (2): 409–438.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, S., Séret, B. and Clarke, S. (2010) [http://66.112.194.141/shark_fin_report_final.pdf ''Shark fins in Europe: Implications for reforming the EU finning ban''], [[IUCN]] Shark Specialist Group.&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to swim effectively, they sink to the bottom of the ocean and die of [[suffocation]] or are eaten by other predators. Shark finning at sea enables fishing vessels to increase profitability and increase the number of sharks harvested, as they only have to store and transport the fins, by far the most profitable part of the shark; the shark meat is bulky to transport.&lt;ref name="Clarke2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=Shelley|last2=Milner-Gulland |first2=E.J.|last3=Bjorndal |first3=Trond |title=Social, Economic, and Regulatory Drivers of the Shark Fin Trade|journal=Marine Resource Economics|date=October 2007|volume=22|issue=3|pages=305–327|url=http://purl.umn.edu/47060|accessdate=3 April 2012|publisher=Marine Resources Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries have banned this practice and require the whole shark to be brought back to port before removing the fins.

Shark finning increased since 1997 largely due to the increasing demand for shark fins for [[shark fin soup]] and traditional cures, particularly in China and its territories, and as a result of improved fishing technology and market economics. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]'s Shark Specialist Group say that shark finning is widespread, and that "the rapidly expanding and largely unregulated shark fin trade represents one of the most serious threats to shark populations worldwide".&lt;ref name="Buckley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckley|first=Louis|title=The End of the Line|year=2007|publisher=WildAid|page=21|url=http://wildaid.org/sites/default/files/resources/EndOfTheLine2007US.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202162302/http://wildaid.org/sites/default/files/resources/EndOfTheLine2007US.pdf|archivedate=2 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the global value of the shark fin trade range from US$540&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref name="Clarke2007" /&gt; to US$1.2&amp;nbsp;billion (2007).&lt;ref name="York2003"/&gt; Shark fins are among the most expensive seafood products, commonly retailing at US$400&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="Buckley" /&gt; In the United States, where finning is prohibited, some buyers regard the [[whale shark]] and the [[basking shark]] as trophy species, and pay $10,000 to $20,000 for a fin.&lt;ref name="NG02"&gt;

The regulated global catch of sharks reported to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations has been stable in recent years at an annual average just over 500,000 tonnes. Additional unregulated and unreported catches are thought to be common.&lt;ref name=FAO2014&gt;[http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3720e.pdf The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2014] Page 17 and 124, [[FAO]], Rome. {{ISBN|978-92-5-108275-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Nearly every fin of a shark is targeted for harvest, as highlighted in the diagram. The primary and secondary [[dorsal fin]]s are removed from the top of the shark, plus its [[pectoral fins]], and, in a single cutting motion, the [[pelvic fin]], [[anal fin]], and bottom portion of its [[caudal fin]], or tail.&lt;ref name=vannuccini&gt;{{cite web |last=Vannuccini |first=S |year=1999 |title=Shark utilization, marketing and trade. FAO Fisheries Technical Paper. No. 389. Rome, FAO |url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/X3690E/x3690e0p.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the rest of the shark has little value relative to that of its fins, sharks are sometimes finned while fishing vessels are still at sea, and the finless and often still-living shark is thrown back into the sea to free space aboard the vessel.&lt;ref name="WA"/&gt; In legal contexts the use of the term "shark finning" can refer specifically to this practice of removing the fins from live sharks and discarding the carcass while still at sea.&lt;ref name="fowler-seret" /&gt; For these legal purposes the removal of fins on land during catch processing is not necessarily considered to be shark finning.&lt;ref name="fowler-seret"&gt;Fowler, S. &amp; Seret, B. (2010). Shark fins in Europe: implications for reforming the EU finning Ban. (Plymouth and Burnaby, BC: European Elasmobranch Association and IUCN Shark Specialist Group)&lt;/ref&gt;

===On individual sharks===
[[File:Carcharias taurus in UShaka Sea World 1079-a.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[sand tiger shark]] is a large coastal shark that inhabits coastal waters worldwide. Its numbers have declined significantly, and it is now listed as a [[vulnerable species]] on the [[IUCN Red List]].&lt;ref name=IUCNREDLIST&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Pollard D, Smith A | last-author-amp = yes | title = ''Carcharias taurus'' | journal = [[The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] | volume = 2009 | page = e.T3854A10132481 | publisher = [[IUCN]] | date = 2009 | url = http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/3854/0 | doi = 10.2305/IUCN.UK.2009-2.RLTS.T3854A10132481.en | access-date = 15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
 
When sharks have been finned, they are likely to die from lack of oxygen because they are not able to move to filter the water through their gills, or are eaten by other fish that have found them defenseless at the bottom of the ocean. Though studies suggest that 73 million sharks are finned each year, scientists have noted that the numbers may actually be closer to the 100 million mark. Due to the fact that sharks do not mature and mate until they are approximately 30 years old, their reproduction rate is slow and cannot keep pace with the current mortality rate.&lt;ref&gt;http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/6890/Latchford_Lauren_MP_Final.pdf|{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Title = Conservation or culture? An analysis of shark finning in the united states| Author = Lauren Latchford| Year = 2013| accessdate = 27 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===On shark populations===
Some studies suggest 26 to 73 million sharks are harvested annually for fins. The annual median for the period from 1996 to 2000 was 38&amp;nbsp;million, which is nearly four times the number recorded by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) of the United Nations,&lt;ref name="Clarke2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=Shelley C.|first2=Murdoch K. |last2=McAllister |first3=E.

It has been reported that the global shark catch in 2012 was 100 million.&lt;ref name="BBC news"&gt;BBC (UK) news item transmitted 5 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharks have a [[r/K selection theory|K-selection]] life history, which means that they tend to grow slowly, reach maturity at a larger size and a later age, and have low reproductive rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pauly|first1=D.|first2=L. |last2=Biery|year=2012|title=A global review of species-specific shark-fin-to-body-mass ratios and relevant legislation|journal=Journal of Fish Biology |volume=80 |issue=5 |pages=1643–1677 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2011.03215.x |pmid=22497402}}&lt;/ref&gt; These traits make them especially vulnerable to [[overfishing]] methods, such as shark finning. Recent studies suggest changes in abundance of [[apex predators]] may have cascading impacts on a variety of ecological processes.

Numbers of some shark species have dropped as much as 80% over the last 50 years.&lt;ref name="LM2"&gt;

Some organizations claim that shark fishing or [[bycatch]] (the unintentional capture of species by other fisheries) is the reason for the decline in some species' populations and that the market for fins has very little impact – bycatch accounts for an estimated 50% of all sharks taken&lt;ref name="WA" /&gt; – others that the market for shark fin soup is the main reason for the decline.&lt;ref name="LM2" /&gt;

===On other populations===

According to Giam's article,&lt;ref name="GCH"/&gt; "Sharks are caught in virtually all parts of the world.... Despite the strongly declared objectives of the Fisheries Commission in Brussels, there are very few restrictions on fishing for sharks in European waters. The meat of [[Squaliformes|dogfish]]es, [[smoothhound]]s, [[cat shark]]s, [[skate (fish)|skates]] and [[Batoidea|rays]] is in high demand by European consumers.... The situation in Canada and the United States is similar: the [[blue shark]] is sought after as a sport fish while the porbeagle, mako and [[spiny dogfish]] are part of the commercial fishery.... The truth is this: Sharks will continue to be caught and killed on a wide scale by the more organized and sophisticated fishing nations. Targeting shark's fin soup will not stop this accidental catch. The fins from these catches will be thrown away or turned into animal feed and fertilizers if shark's fin soup is shunned."
&lt;!--not sure this is relevant, it is general ecosystem dynamics:Large-scale removal of sharks may severely unbalance the [[ecosystem]] of warm seas by allowing some species of large or middle-sized fish to multiply or grow bigger: for an example see [[grouper]].--&gt;
&lt;!--another way to look at the reduced pressure is that it removes pressure on species that both humans and sharks prefer--&gt;

In 2007, Canadian filmmaker and photographer [[Rob Stewart (filmmaker)|Rob Stewart]] created a film, ''[[Sharkwater]]'', which exposes the shark fin industry in detail.
In March 2011, the VOA [[Special English]] service of the [[Voice of America]] broadcast a 15-minute science program on shark finning.

However, researchers dispute this claim by pointing to the data: using a statistical analysis of shark fin industry trade data, a 2006 study estimated that between 26 and 73 million sharks are harvested each year worldwide.{{sfnp|Clarke|McAllister|Milner-Gulland|Kirkwood|2006|p=1119|ps=: "Estimates of the total number of sharks traded annually worldwide, based on all fin positions combined, ranged from 26 to 73 million... with an overall [[median]] of 38&amp;nbsp;million"}} That figure, when converted to shark [[biomass]], was three to four times higher than the catch recorded in [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] capture production statistics, the only global database of shark catches.{{sfnp|Clarke|McAllister|Milner-Gulland|Kirkwood|2006|p=1120|ps=: "Our median biomass estimate for the global shark fin trade based on all fin positions combined (1.70&amp;nbsp;million tonnes year&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) is more than four times higher than the midrange FAO-based figure (0.39&amp;nbsp;million tonnes), and nearly three times higher than the high FAO estimate (0.60&amp;nbsp;million tonnes year&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)"}} According to the researchers, this discrepancy "may be attributable to factors... such as unrecorded shark landings, shark biomass recorded in [non-specific] categories, and/or a high frequency of shark finning and carcass disposal at sea."{{sfnp|Clarke|McAllister|Milner-Gulland|Kirkwood|2006|p=1120}} Simply put, they say that the industry is either under-reporting the sharks taken annually, or is frequently engaging in the practice of finning.

==International restrictions==
[[File:Shark fins Hong Kong.jpg|thumb|right|Fresh shark fins drying on a pavement in Hong Kong]]
In 2013, 27 countries and the European Union had banned shark finning;&lt;ref name="HSI" /&gt; however, [[international waters]] are unregulated. International fishing authorities are considering banning shark fishing (and finning) in the Atlantic Ocean and [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Finning is banned in the Eastern [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]],&lt;ref name="ENS"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but shark fishing and finning continues unabated in most of the Pacific and Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name="WA"/&gt; In countries such as Thailand and Singapore, public awareness advertisements on finning have reportedly reduced consumption by 25%.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

There are four main categories of restrictions, as follows: 
* Shark sanctuary (an area where shark fishing is entirely prohibited);
* Areas where sharks must be landed with fins attached;
* Areas where fin to body mass ratio-based regulations have been implemented;
* Areas where shark product trade regulations exist.&lt;ref&gt;Biery L. and Pauly, D. (2012) A global review of species-specific shark-fin-to-body-mass ratios and relevant legislation, Journal of Fish Biology&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
Shark finning was prohibited in the EU in 2003 (Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003).&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:167:0001:0003:EN:PDF COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1185/2003 of 26 June 2003 on the removal of fins of sharks on board vessels]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the [[European Commission|EC]] approved a rule that would require all EU-registered fishing boats to land only sharks which have retained all their fins.  Because the legislation allowed fins to be removed on the boat and different body parts to be landed at different ports, the ban proved difficult to enforce. The EU Parliament's fisheries committee supported the EC's proposal to ban the separate landing of shark bodies and fins, however, the committee approved an amendment which allows fins to be removed on board a vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theparliament.com/latest-news/article/newsarticle/eu-parliament-urged-to-close-loopholes-in-shark-fin-legislation/|title=EU parliament urged to close 'loopholes' in shark fin legislation|author=Banks, M.|publisher=The Parliament.com|date=25 September 2012|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 March 2012, the Council of the EU adopted a general approach supporting the Commission's proposal to close the loopholes in the EU shark finning legislation by ensuring that all sharks were landed with their fins naturally attached without exception. It is believed that Spain and Portugal were the only EU Member States to raise objections to the Commission's proposal.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

On 6 June 2013, the Council of the EU completed the final step to close loopholes in the EU shark finning ban. By adopting a "fins naturally attached" policy without exception, the EU has now effectively ended the practice of shark finning by EU vessels.&lt;ref name="HSI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsi.org/world/europe/work/shark_finning/facts/shark_finning_Europe.html|title=Shark finning and the European Union|author=Humane Society International|author2=Europe|year=2013|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National restrictions==

===Australia===
Shark finning is not allowed in any [[tuna]] or [[billfish]] longline fishery, or in any Commonwealth fishery taking sharks.  Fins must be landed attached, and additional regulations apply in some states or territories. In [[New South Wales]], sharks taken or any relevant portion of a shark taken may not be on board any vessel at any time (including after landing) without fins naturally attached.&lt;ref&gt;Fisheries Management Act 1994, s.8 Notification – Fishing Closure (Official Notices, 2 September 2011 NSW Government Gazette No. 86 Department of Primary Industries&lt;/ref&gt;

====Imported products====
In Australia, the export and import of wildlife and wildlife products is regulated under Part 13A of the federal [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]] (EPBC Act), which is administered by the [[Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities]]. Regulation applies equally to individuals, commercial organisations and not-for-profit organisations.  CITES Appendix II shark specimens cannot be legally imported into Australia for personal or commercial purposes unless:
* The specimen is accompanied by a valid Australian CITES import permit (Australian import permits can be granted only if an overseas CITES export permit has been granted); or
* The specimen is accompanied by a valid certificate issued by the overseas CITES management authority confirming that the specimen was obtained before the species was listed on CITES (pre-CITES certificate); or
* The specimen is accompanied by an overseas CITES export permit or equivalent, is part of personal accompanied baggage and is intended for personal use and not for trade or sale.

No permits are required for the import of specimens obtained from shark species other than those listed above, however, to avoid seizure all products must be clearly labelled or have documentation certifying the species of origin.

===Canada===
Shark finning has been illegal in Canada since 1994, but importing fins from other regions without such regulations is allowed.&lt;ref name=mississ-ban /&gt;

In late 2011, the city of [[Brantford, Ontario]] became the first city in Canada to pass new [[bylaw]]s to ban the possession, sale or consumption of shark fin products.

[[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] and [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]] opted not to bring forth the motion, suggesting that this issue is a federal matter.

In late 2012, the [[Ontario Superior Court]] overturned Toronto's shark fin ban, ruling that the law as written was outside the powers of the city to impose without a "legitimate local purpose", and was therefore of "no force and effect." The judge accepted that the practice of shark finning was inhumane, but he did not agree with Toronto's justification of local purpose —– namely, that the consumption of shark fins may have an "adverse impact" on the health and safety of its residents and on the environmental well-being of the city.&lt;ref name=TorontoBanLifted&gt;{{cite news|last=Kari|first=Shannon|title=Ontario court overturns Toronto's shark fin ban|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/ontario-court-overturns-torontos-shark-fin-ban/article5881455/|accessdate=19 January 2013|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toronto has served legal notice that it plans to appeal the court ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stewart|first=John|title=Is municipal shark fin ban dead in the water?|url=http://www.mississauga.com/news/article/1560843--is-municipal-shark-fin-ban-dead-in-the-water|accessdate=19 January 2013|newspaper=Metroland News|date=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2012, Ontario Superior Court Judge James Spence ruled that Toronto's ban was not valid. Members of Toronto's Chinese business community had also challenged that ban. Judge Spence had said the city does not have the power to enforce the ban. [[Toronto]]'s mayor [[Rob Ford]] in September 2012 believed the ban was not the cities responsibility and so did not support it at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ontario judge rules Toronto's shark fin ban invalid|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-judge-rules-toronto-s-shark-fin-ban-invalid-1.1221802|work=CBC News Toronto|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 March 2013 a private members bill to ban shark fin imports into Canada failed in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. Shark finning was already illegal in Canadian waters, but there was no law to stop importing into Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Private member's bill pushing shark fin import ban fails|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/private-member-s-bill-pushing-shark-fin-import-ban-fails-1.1324003|work=CBC News Ottawa|accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it would be restarted by Conservative Senate member [[Michael L.

On 8 May 2013 Calgary's City Council decided to wait until December 2013 and recommended leaning away from a total ban and look for ethical sources of shark products. Alderman John Mar said there will be more time to discuss and engage and to look for other options. The new wording in the bylaw was meant to ban the sale, distribution and trade of shark fins, but not ban the possession and consumption. Canada's city of Vancouver councillor [[Kerry Jang]] was at Calgary's council meeting and said that it was not a cultural thing, and that even China and the Chinese government decided to phase out all shark fins from state banquets. He also mentioned that the wordings of the bylaws in Calgary and Toronto, which face legal problems with municipal jurisdiction, are trying to ban possession and consumption, but that is hard to enforce and regulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calgary delays shark fin ban decision|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-delays-shark-fin-ban-decision-1.1306222|work=CBC News Calgary|accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 May 2013, against the wishes of the Shark Fin Free Calgary organization, [[Calgary City Council]] overturned the ban. There were protests against the ban from Calgary's Chinese community, and [[Calgary]]'s city task force recommended against the ban. According to the article in The [[Calgary Herald]], Calgary's Mayor [[Naheed Nenshi]] never wanted a full ban, even though he had voted for the ban the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Council shelves push for shark fin ban|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/calgary/Council+shelves+push+shark/8440252/story.html|work=Calgary Herald|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Minister, [[Ahmad Shabery Cheek]], said that the ban of shark finning is "unnecessary" as the finning industry does not exist in Malaysia He went on further to say "Sharks are normally caught by accident when they enter the fish nets along with the other fishes."&lt;ref name="shaberycheek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therakyatpost.com/news/2015/10/05/no-need-for-ban-on-shark-hunting-finning-industry-says-shabery-cheek/ |title=No need for ban on shark hunting, finning industry, says Shabery Cheek |publisher=The Rakyat Post |date=5 October 2015 |accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Update|section|date=December 2017}}

[[Bill Clinton]] signed the [[Shark Finning Prohibition Act of 2000]] (SFPA), which banned finning on any fishing vessel within United States territorial waters, and on all U.S.-flagged fishing vessels in international waters. Additionally, shark fins could not be imported into the United States without the associated carcass. In 1991, the percentage of sharks killed by U.S. longline fisheries in the Pacific Ocean for finning was approximately 3%. By 1998, that percentage had grown to 60%. Between 1991 and 1998, the number of sharks retained by the Hawaii-based swordfish and tuna longline fishery had increased from 2,289 to 60,857 annually, and by 1998, an estimated 98% of these sharks were killed for their fins.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Judge [[Stephen Reinhardt]] found that the ''King Diamond&amp;nbsp;II'' did not meet the statute's definition of a fishing vessel, since it had merely bought the fins at sea and had not aided or assisted the vessels that had caught the sharks.&lt;ref name="U.S. v.

As a result, in January 2011, President [[Barack Obama]] signed the [[Shark Conservation Act]] into law to close the loopholes.

In 2012, legislators in the [[New York State Assembly]], including [[Grace Meng]], introduced a similar bill, which passed in 2013. While New York was not the only [[Eastern United States|Eastern]] state considering a ban, passage there would be significant since its Chinese American communities in [[Chinatown, Manhattan]] and [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] make New York the major importer of shark fins in the East. Meng admitted that while she loved shark fin soup, "it's important to be responsible citizens." Younger Chinese Americans in New York did not consider it an important part of their culture.

===United Nations===
In recent decades high demands and numerous forces of economic globalization has come together to create a true global mart. There has been a combination of growth and antifinning regulations that has led fishers to see sharks as a commercial species. This has unintentionally caused commercial species to be targeted rather than targeting more-valuable species like tuna and swordfish. 
However, the emergence of a new market for shark fins with addition to stricter regulations has all created a greater incentive for the full utilization of the shark. Now this is an important aspect to consider, as where antifinning and environmental groups can be successful in terms of decreasing the consumption and the practice of shark finning.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4795e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Siege of Ascalon''' took place in 1153, resulting in the capture of that [[Egypt]]ian fortress by the [[Crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]].

== Background ==
Ascalon was [[Fatimid]] Egypt's greatest and most important frontier fortress. The [[Battle of Ascalon]] was fought outside the city in 1099 in the aftermath of the [[First Crusade]] and the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|fall of Jerusalem]] to the Crusaders. Although the crusaders were victorious, internal disputes in their camp allowed Ascalon to remain in Egyptian hands. Thereafter, the Fatimids were able to launch raids into the kingdom every year from this fortress, and the southern border of the crusader kingdom remained unstable. If this fortress fell, then the gateway to Egypt would be open. Therefore, the Fatimid garrison in Ascalon remained strong and large.

After the failure of the [[Second Crusade]] in 1148, [[Conrad III of Germany]] attempted to besiege the fortress, but was forced to withdraw when no help was forthcoming from Jerusalem or other crusaders. Meanwhile, the territory to the east and north of Jerusalem was united under [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]], who ruled [[Mosul]] and [[Aleppo]] and brought [[Damascus]] under his influence after the Second Crusade. In 1149 Nur ad-Din defeated the [[Principality of Antioch]] at the [[Battle of Inab]]. Nur ad-Din was unable to overrun Antioch entirely, nor was he able to penetrate far into the Kingdom of Jerusalem, but likewise there was little Jerusalem could do in the north and the east with the whole area united under one strong ruler. The crusader kingdom would have to look towards Egypt if they wanted to expand.

Around 1150, [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]] rebuilt the [[Gaza City]], which at that point lay in ruins. The city was handed over to the [[Knights Templar]], and provided some defense against the continual raids from Ascalon, {{convert|10|mi|km}} to the northeast. Since the establishment of the kingdom, other fortresses had also been built to watch Ascalon. These were [[Ibelin (castle)|Ibelin]] (Yibneh) about {{convert|20|mi|km}} northeast of Ascalon near the coast, [[Blanchegarde]] (Tell es Safi) about {{convert|15|mi|km}} east-northeast, [[Beth Gibelin]] (Bait Jibrin) about {{convert|19|mi|km}} east&lt;ref&gt;Smail, p 211&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Montgisard]] near Ramla {{convert|28|mi|km}} to the northeast.

However, Jerusalem itself was soon divided by civil war. Baldwin III was the legal heir to the kingdom, but his mother [[Melisende of Jerusalem|Queen Melisende]] had been ruling as regent since 1143. In 1152 Baldwin finally demanded full control of the kingdom; after some brief fighting he was able to accomplish this goal. Later that year Baldwin also defeated a [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk Turkish]] invasion of the Kingdom. Encouraged by these victories, Baldwin decided to make an assault on Ascalon in 1153. With the entire army of Jerusalem he marched to the fortress and began to destroy the surrounding [[orchard]]s in January. [[Patriarch Fulcher of Jerusalem|Patriarch Fulcher]] was also present, along with [[Raymond du Puy de Provence]] and [[Bernard de Tremelay]], the masters of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitallers]] and Templars respectively, and all the other great barons of the kingdom, including [[Hugh of Ibelin]], [[Philip of Milly]], [[Humphrey II of Toron]], and [[Raynald of Châtillon]]. The siege was undertaken both by land and by sea, with the fleet commanded by Gerard of Sidon. The crusader force was also bolstered by a large group of pilgrims, who happened to be on their way to Jerusalem at the time.

On the Fatimid side, the city was garrisoned by members of the local Kananiyya tribe, as well as a cavalry contingent from Cairo, some 400 to 600 strong, that was rotated into the city every six months.{{sfn|Lev|1991|pp=103, 126—127}} In response to the Crusader attack, the [[vizier]] [[Ibn as-Sallar]] began preparing reinforcements for the city in March, as well as a naval expedition.{{sfn|Lev|1991|pp=103–104}} The army set off and got as far as [[Bilbays]], while Ibn al-Sallar supervised the final preparations of the fleet, including a naval review and the payment of the crews. The army commanders at Bilbays, led by Ibn al-Sallar's stepson [[Abbas ibn Abi al-Futuh]], hatched a plot to kill the vizier, which was carried out on 3 April. The army returned to Cairo, where Abbas became vizier, leaving Ascalon largely to its fate.{{sfn|Lev|1991|p=104}}{{sfn|Daftary|1992|p=250}} The Fatimid fleet sailed to Ascalon and easily dispersed the weak Crusader squadron of 15 ships, but as the city's harbour was unsuitable for sustaining a fleet for long periods of time, it had to return to Egypt.{{sfn|Lev|1991|p=104}}

[[Siege tower]]s were constructed, and for five months there were many skirmishes and victories and defeats on both sides. Ascalon was vast and virtually impenetrable; behind its massive walls and gates were twice as many defenders as there were besiegers outside, and there were supplies of food to last for years. In May the Egyptian fleet arrived to resupply the city; Gerard of Sidon's little fleet could do nothing to stop them. However, a setback for Ascalon occurred in August when the besieged tried to burn down one of the crusader siege towers; the wind pushed the fire back against their own walls, causing a large section to collapse. According to [[William of Tyre]], knights of the Order rushed through the breach without Baldwin's knowledge while [[Bernard de Tremelay]] and about forty of his Templars were killed by the larger Egyptian garrison. Their bodies were displayed on the ramparts and their heads were sent to the caliph in Cairo. In a differing account by a [[Damascus|Damascene]] chronicler in the city, the breach of the wall is simply mentioned as a precursor to the fall of the city; he makes no mention of the incident with the Templars. Because of William of Tyre's dislike of the Order, and the wildly inaccurate news that reached Europe during the crusades, his account must be treated with caution; but regardless of which account is believed, Bernard was killed during the fighting.

By now the crusaders were becoming fatigued and it was suggested that they abandon the siege. The Hospitallers and the Patriarch, however, convinced the king that they were on the verge of victory. Three days later another assault was made, and another entrance was forced. After bitter fighting the city fell to the crusaders on August 19, and the fortress was formally surrendered to them three days later. The citizens were allowed to leave in peace; most fled back to Egypt.

== Aftermath ==
Ascalon was turned into a [[diocese]] directly under the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]], although in earlier times it had been a suffragan of the Bishop of [[Bethlehem]]. The city's mosque was reconsecrated as a church. The city was also added to the County of Jaffa, which was already held by Baldwin III's brother [[Amalric I of Jerusalem|Amalric]]. The double [[County of Jaffa and Ascalon]] later became the most important crusader seigneury, held either as an [[apanage]] to the crown or granted to influential barons.

The fall of Ascalon contributed to the downfall of Fatimid Egypt. Amalric succeeded his brother as king of Jerusalem in 1162, and throughout the 1160s led numerous expeditions from Ascalon into Egypt. These [[Crusader invasions of Egypt]] failed to bring that country under Amalric's control.

==History==
===2013-2015===
The festival was established in 2013 with headline performances from [[The Olllam]], [[Niamh Parsons]] and the [[John McSherry (musician)|John McSherry Band]]. Arists Lorcan Vallely and Barry Kerr exhibited at the festival. Glór Uachtar Tíre's Scoil Samhraidh Shéamuis Uí Néill,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gloruachtartire.com/scoil-samhraidh/4558255935|title=Scoil Samhraidh Shéamus Uí Néill 2017 (Séamus Ó Neill Summer School 2017)|publisher=Glór Uachtar Tire|language=ga|access-date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; an annual Irish language weekend became part of the Soma programme and has been included on an annual basis since. In 2014 the festival received support from [[Down District Council]], [[Ring of Gullion AONB]] and the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] enabling them to expand their programme. The festival was headlined by [[Irish people|Irish]] singer [[Cara Dillon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishpost.co.uk/folk-singer-cara-dillon-reveals-songs-inspired-by-emigrants-stories/|title=Folk singer Cara Dillon reveals songs inspired by emigrants' stories|date=2 July 2014|work=Irish Post|access-date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olllam and Balkan Alien Sound.

In 2015, the festival was headlined by singer-songwriter [[Duke Special]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishnews.com/arts/2015/07/20/news/soma-enchanted-evening-in-castlewellan-197710/|title=Soma enchanted evening in Castlewellan|last=McMillen|first=Robert|date=|work=The Irish News|access-date=29 April 2017}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supported by the newly created [[Newry, Mourne and Down District Council]] [[Reform of local government in Northern Ireland|supercouncil]], the festival expanded greatly. Performers included [[Beoga]], Moxie, [[Karen Matheson]], [[Muireann Nic Amhlaoibh]], [[Pauline Scanlon]], [[John Spillane]], John McSherry and [[Dónal O'Connor]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and an Irish language music and cabaret hosted by [[RTÉ]] [[Raidió na Gaeltachta]] presenter [[Rónán Mac Aodha Bhuí]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitmournemountains.co.uk/MourneMountains/media/MourneMountains/Publications/Files/DM-8-14-July-2016.pdf|title=Whats On - July 2017|date=|publisher=Northern Ireland Tourist Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uilleann pipes|Uilleann piper]] John McSherry and composer [[Colin Harper]] launched their book, ''Wheels of the World: 300 Years of Uilleann Pipers'' and piper [[Paddy Keenan]] and singer [[Mary Dillon]] were among musicians giving workshops.

===2016-present===
In 2016 the festival was awarded sponsorship from [[Northern Ireland Tourist Board|Tourism Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tourismni.com/link/6094e938ce944ec18615ee2c3e19d8d1.aspx|title=TEFP2016.17 Awards - Tourism NI|date=|publisher=Northern Ireland Tourist Board|format=xls}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, the festival featured performances from [[Lisa Hannigan]], [[Eddi Reader]], [[Dónal Lunny]], [[Flook (band)|Flook]], [[Declan O'Rourke]] and Breaking Trad.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.belfasttimes.co.uk/10-exciting-things-to-do-in-northern-ireland-july-11-17/|title=10 exciting things to do in Northern Ireland (July 11 – 17)|date=8 July 2016|work=Belfast Times|access-date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To celebrate NI Year of Food and Drink 2016, the Soma Festival initiated the now-annual ''Soma Taste Experience'',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; bringing together artisan food and [[craft beer]] producers from County Down and around Ireland. ''Soma Body &amp; Soul'' became another annual festival feature with well-being professionals offering free and paid activities over two days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bamni.co.uk/2016/07/12/try-something-new-at-the-soma-body-soul-festival-this-weekend/|title=Try Something New At The SOMA Body &amp; Soul Festival This Weekend|last=Calder|first=Tina|date=12 July 2016|website=BAM!|access-date=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Soma Craft Fair''&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[market square]] was held in Castlewellan's Upper Square, with ''Soma Kids'' held in Lower Square. The 2016 Soma Festival was estimated to have attracted 15,000 participants, including more than 200 musicians, artists, well-being practitioners, entertainers and cooks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://patrickclarke74.blogspot.co.uk/2016/07/castlewellan-49th-agricultural-show-and.html|title=Castlewellan 49th Agricultural Show and Soma Festival tremendous successes|last=Clarke|first=Patrick|date=July 2016|website=Blogspot - Patrick Clarke LLB|access-date=29 April 2017}}{{deadlink|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 festival took place from 12–16 July of that year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Parliamentary elections''' were held in [[Somalia]] on 31 December 1984. The country was a [[one-party state]] at the time, with the [[Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party]] as the sole legal party. Voters were asked to approve a list of 171 SRSP candidates. Turnout was reported to be 99.86% by the [[Communist Somalia|communist government]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/SOMALIA_1979_E.PDF Somalia] Inter-Parliamentary Union&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4256">The '''Tarquinian conspiracy''' was a conspiracy amongst a number of senators and leading men of [[ancient Rome]] in 509 BC to reinstate the monarchy, and to put [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]] back on the throne.  The conspirators were discovered and executed.  The story is part of Rome's early semi-legendary history.

==Background==
In 509 BC the [[Roman kingdom|Roman monarchy]] was overthrown as a result of general resentment at the behaviour of the king Tarquinius Superbus, and especially his son [[Sextus Tarquinius]] who had raped [[Lucretia]], a Roman woman of noble background.  A coup, led by [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], resulted in the expulsion of the royal family.  The [[Roman Republic]] was established, and [[Roman consul|consuls]] were elected to govern the city on an annual basis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#58|1.58-60]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy formed, but discovered==
Brutus was elected as one of Rome's first two consuls in 509 BC.  In that year ambassadors from the royal family arrived in Rome to seek to persuade the senate to return to the royals their personal effects which had been seized during the coup.  In secret, while the [[Roman senate]] debated the request, the ambassadors sought supporters of the monarchy in Rome to form a conspiracy to re-admit the royal family to the city.  Two brothers of Brutus' wife, of the Vitellii, both of whom were senators, were chief amongst the conspiracy, along with three brothers of the Aquilii, and other leading men whose names are no longer recorded.  Two of Brutus' sons, [[Titus Junius Brutus]] and [[Tiberius Junius Brutus]] joined them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#3|2.3-4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:David Brutus.jpg|right|thumb|320px|''The Lictors Bring Home the Sons of Brutus'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1784)]]
However, a slave of the Vitelii, having witnessed a meeting of the conspirators at his master's house (which, according to [[Plutarch]], involved a horrific oath by human sacrifice and cannibalism), alerted the consuls who immediately seized the ambassadors and the conspirators without great tumult.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#4|2.4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Punishment==
The ambassadors of the royal family had persuaded the conspirators to confirm their dedication to the royalist cause in writing, and therefore the guilt of the conspirators was not in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#4|2.4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ambassadors were released, out of respect for the law of nations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#4|2.4]]&lt;/ref&gt; However the traitors were condemned to death, including the sons of Brutus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#5|2.5]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The consuls sat upon the tribunal to witness the execution.  The [[lictors]] were dispatched to carry out the punishment.  The traitors were stripped naked, beaten with rods, and then beheaded.  Brutus the consul is said to have burst forth with emotion at times during the punishment of his sons,&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#5|2.5]]&lt;/ref&gt; although elsewhere he is said to have watched stoically while the punishment was carried out.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', From "Life of Poplicola": 'Brutus, however, is said not to have turned aside his face, nor allowed the least glance of pity to soften and smooth his aspect of rigour and austerity, but sternly watched his children suffer'&lt;/ref&gt;

The slave who had revealed the conspiracy was granted his freedom and status as a Roman citizen, and was also awarded a sum of money as reward.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#5|2.5]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TeamIndus''' (incorporated as '''Axiom Research Labs'''&lt;ref name='Axiom 2017'&gt;[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/how-axiom-research-labs-has-emerged-as-indias-first-first-private-aerospace-company/articleshow/57101170.cms How Axiom Research Labs has emerged as India's first private aerospace company]. Kunal Talgeri, ''Economic Times''. 12 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a private [[for-profit]] [[aerospace]] company  headquartered in [[Bangalore]], India. It consists of a team of professionals from various backgrounds in science, technology, finance, and media, that came together in 2010 with the aim of winning the [[Google Lunar X Prize]] competition announced in 2007. Although the competition ended in 2018 without a winner, TeamIndus is still working towards developing and launching their lunar rover mission sometime in 2019.&lt;ref name='2019 launch'/&gt;&lt;ref name='2019 launch BBC'/&gt;

TeamIndus' lander is code-named '''HHK1''', and their rover is called '''ECA''', an abbreviation for ''Ek Choti si Asha'' (''A Small Hope'').&lt;ref name=ECA&gt;[https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/2018/04/08/startup-street-indian-startup-gets-another-chance-to-land-rover-on-moon Startup Street: Indian Startup Gets Another Chance To Land Rover On Moon]. Mahima Kapoor and Azman Usmani, ''Bloomberg''. 8 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financing==

Axiom Research Labs was established in 2010 with the aim to compete for the Google  Lunar X Prize, and the following year it registered its team as TeamIndus.&lt;ref name='Axiom 2017'/&gt; One of its co-founders was Rahul Narayan, who said in 2016 that the overall cost of the venture was expected to be US$75&amp;nbsp;million. In 2013, TeamIndus moved from [[Delhi]] to [[Bangalore]] due to the strategic location of the city. The [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO) is based in Bangalore which has also excellent aerospace companies that could help the team with building the lander and rover. L&amp;T was helping by reviewing designs, and Rajiv Mody, founder CEO of the engineering firm Sasken Technologies  gave space in its Bangalore facility for the team to operate out of and several former ISRO scientists were providing advice.&lt;ref name=eTimes/&gt;

The single largest investor at that time was [[Nandan Nilekani]], who became involved in 2014 when TeamIndus launched its first round of funding, raising US$35&amp;nbsp;million. A second fundraising round in 2016 obtained investment from people such as R. K. Damani, [[Rakesh Jhunjhunwala]], Ashish Kacholia, [[Rajiv Mody]], Subrata Mitra, Shekhar Kirani, and [[Sharad Sharma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bullish investors back Team Indus moon shot |last=Madhumathi |first=D.

The organisation was awarded in January 2015 an interim US$1&amp;nbsp;million prize by Google Lunar X Prize for their successful demonstration on Earth of a proposed lunar landing system.&lt;ref name='milestone'&gt;{{cite news |last=Stevens |first=Tim |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/glxp-milestone-prizes-awarded/ |title=$5.25 million awarded to five Google Lunar XPrize teams with the right stuff |work=CNET |date=26 January 2015 |accessdate=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

The Google Lunar X Prize competition ended in 2018 without a winner as no team met the 31 March 2018 launch deadline. Regardless, TeamIndus is still looking for funding in order to continue development and secure a launch vehicle for sometime in 2019.&lt;ref name='2019 launch BBC'&gt;{{cite news |work=BBC |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/newsbeat-42825070/google-cancels-30m-competition-to-travel-to-the-moon |title=Google cancels $30m competition to travel to the moon |date=25 January 2018 |accessdate=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Previous competition===

{{further|Google Lunar X Prize}}

In 2011, Axiom Research Labs registered a competing team at the [[Google Lunar X Prize]] under the name TeamIndus. The Google Lunar X Prize was a competition announced in 2007 that was open to privately funded ventures aimed at inspiring the development of low-cost robotic lunar exploration. The competing craft were required to travel more than {{convert|500|m|ft}} on the lunar surface and transmit high-resolution video and images once there.&lt;ref name="xprize"/&gt; TeamIndus registered for the competition in 2011.&lt;ref name=eTimes&gt;[https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/aerospace-startup-team-indus-may-crash-land-due-to-a-paucity-of-funds/articleshow/63278225.cms Aerospace startup Team Indus may crash land due to a paucity of funds]. Hari Pulakkat, ''Economic Times''. 13 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The launch deadline of the competition, which initially attracted entries from over 30 teams from 17 countries, was 31 March 2018.&lt;ref name="cnet2014april"&gt;{{cite news |title=Google Lunar XPrize competition enters milestone phase |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-lunar-x-prize-competition-announces-five-teams-eligible-for-6-million-milestone-prizes/ |last=Stevens |first=Tim |date=1 April 2014 |work=CNET |accessdate=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google Lunar X Prize offered a main prize of US$20&amp;nbsp;million, a second prize of US$5&amp;nbsp;million and bonus prizes of US$5&amp;nbsp;million. Additional prizes totalling US$4.75&amp;nbsp;million were offered to those teams that met specific targets by 31 March 2018.&lt;ref name="xprize"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lunar.xprize.org/|title=Google Lunar XPRIZE Home Page|publisher=Google Lunar XPRIZE|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnet2017jan"&gt;{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Stevens |title=Five Google Lunar XPrize teams confirm they're set for the moon |work=CNET |date=24 January 2017 |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/five-google-lunar-xprize-teams-have-confirmed-launch-contracts-to-the-moon/ |accessdate=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition ended in 2018 without a winner as no team met the launch deadline. TeamIndus initially planned to attempt to win the endurance and distance bonus prizes by designing a [[Moon landing|lunar lander]] and two [[rover (space exploration)|rovers]]. They planned for the two rovers to be deployed together, which had a combined total mass of approximately {{convert|15|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=N. Gopal|last1=Raj|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/indian-team-in-lunar-rover-competition/article1684119.ece|accessdate=2016-10-31|newspaper=Hindu e-news|location=Chennai, India|title=Indian team in lunar rover competition|date=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One rover was to compete for the main task, i.e. to travel more than 500&amp;nbsp;meters on the lunar surface and send feedback to Earth. The other rover would have competed for the US$5&amp;nbsp;million worth prize by completing additional tasks beyond baseline requirements to win the grand or the second place prize, such as endurance and range.

In 2016, a contract with ISRO for a launch in 2017 was scheduled,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://zeenews.india.com/space/indian-space-start-ups-lunar-dream-gets-isro-support-aims-for-global-prize_1945160.html|title=Indian space start-up's lunar dream gets ISRO support; aims for global prize!|date=31 October 2016|work=Zee News|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a [[Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle]] operated by [[ISRO]] from the island of [[Sriharikota]].&lt;ref name="cnet2014april"/&gt; The launch contract was signed but not fully paid for.&lt;ref name=eTimes/&gt; The rocket was to be shared with [[Hakuto]], a fellow competitor from Japan.&lt;ref name="cnet2017jan"/&gt; The planned mission duration was 30 Earth days.

The TeamIndus' lunar lander platform was code-named HHK1. The team planned a further modification of the HHK1 for other terrestrial and inter-stellar application after the Google Lunar X Prize competition had completed. For the competition, the HHK1 was to deploy the rovers and then operate as the main communication and control unit consisting of payload, propulsion, structural and other sub-systems.&lt;ref name='Home Site'/&gt; The HHK-1 lander was designed to carry a payload of about 25&amp;nbsp;kg,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/Industry/4R8BEZ4vjO3oe6CPyD6rTP/Augmented-reality-3D-printing-and-a-shot-at-the-moon.html|title=Augmented reality, 3D printing and a shot at the moon|last=Chopra|first=Arushi|date=30 March 2017|work=Live Mint|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; including their two small rovers.&lt;ref name="economictimes.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/science/a-startup-team-from-bengaluru-preparing-for-an-unmanned-lunar-mission/articleshow/56302771.cms |title=A startup team from Bengaluru preparing for an unmanned lunar mission |work=Economic Times |date=3 January 2017 |accessdate=2017-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short in time and money, TeamIndus was unable to launch before the deadline,&lt;ref name=eTimes/&gt; and although the competition ended in 2018 without a winner, TeamIndus is still working towards obtaining funding to develop and secure a launch contract for a desired launch sometime in 2019.&lt;ref name='2019 launch'/&gt;&lt;ref name='2019 launch BBC'/&gt;

Thatcher: "What I said before: Andrew. As crews go in, I want incentives at all levels."

'''Thatchergate''' was the [[colloquial]] title of a [[hoax]] perpetrated by members of the [[anarcho-punk]] band [[Crass]] during the aftermath of the 1982 [[Falklands War]]. Using excerpts from speeches by [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], a recording was spliced together which purported to be a telephone conversation between the two leaders. During the course of the tape Reagan seems to state his intention to use Europe as a battle front to show the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leaders the [[United States|US]]'s resolve in a [[nuclear conflict]], whilst Thatcher appears to imply that [[HMS Sheffield (D80)|HMS ''Sheffield'']] was deliberately sacrificed in order to escalate the Falklands war.

When the recording first surfaced into the public domain in 1983, it was initially considered by the [[US State Department]] to have been [[propaganda]] produced by the Soviet [[KGB]], a story reported by both the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' &lt;ref&gt;San Francisco Chronicle, January 30, 1983.

Our indecision was resolved when a journalist from ''The Observer'' contacted us in relation to 'a certain tape'. At first we denied knowledge, but eventually decided to admit responsibility. We had been meticulously careful in the production and distribution of the tape to ensure that no one knew about our involvement. How ''The Observer'' got hold of information that led to us is a complete mystery. It acted as a substantial warning, if walls did indeed have ears, how much more was known of our activities?"'' - From 'In Which Crass Voluntarily Blow Their Own', sleeve notes to ''Best Before 1984'' {{cite web |url=http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218005505/http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/ |archivedate=2008-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 official government documents were released to the [[The_National_Archives_(United_Kingdom)|National Archives]] revealing the concerns of the UK's [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6).  A Foreign Office adviser's letter to Thatcher said: "This looks like a rather clumsy operation. We have no evidence so far about who is responsible. ...SIS doubt whether this is a Soviet operation. It is possible that one of the Argentine intelligence services might have been behind it; or alternatively it might be the work of left-wing groups in this country."&lt;ref&gt;AFP, 2 January 2014 http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/phoney-margaret-thatcher-ronald-reagan-tape-spooked-british-spies/articleshow/28294946.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

Excerpts of the recording can be heard in the Crass track "Powerless with a Guitar" on the compilation LP ''Devastate to Liberate'' (Yangki - 1985 - Yangki 1).

'''''The Lighthouse''''' is a [[chamber opera]] with words and music by [[Peter Maxwell Davies]].

The scenario was inspired by a true story. In December 1900 a lighthouse supply ship called the ''Hesperus'', based in [[Stromness]], [[Orkney]], went on its routine tour of duty to the [[Flannan Isles]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]] of [[Scotland]]. The lighthouse was empty - all three beds and the table looked as if they had been left in a hurry and the lamp, though out, was in perfect working order, but the men had disappeared into thin air. The composer has taken liberties, and changed the name of the lighthouse to Fladda, this being not a usual name in the Western Isles of Scotland, to avoid offence or distress to any relatives of those concerned in the original incident.

==Production history==
It was first performed in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, on 2 September 1980 as part of the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. The singers were [[Neil Mackie]] ([[tenor]]), [[Michael Rippon (singer)|Michael Rippon]] ([[baritone]]) and [[David Wilson-Johnson]] ([[bass-baritone]]) with [[The Fires of London]] conducted by [[Richard Dufallo]].

In 1983 the Boston Shakespeare Company presented a production directed by [[Peter Sellars]] featuring Michael Brown (tenor), [[Sanford Sylvan]] (baritone), Kenneth Bell (bass), conducted by David Hoose, video by Michael Nishball, costumes by Ellen McCartney and lighting by [[James F. Ingalls]]. Writing for ''The [[New York Times]]'', [[John Rockwell]] described the production as "superbly realized musically and thrilling as theater."  Another Boston company, [[Boston Lyric Opera]] gave two performances in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/10/arts/music/the-lighthouse-from-boston-lyric-opera.html?_r=0  Zachery Woolfe, "Did They Crumble Into Thin Air? Only the Fog Could Tell", ''The New York Times''], 9 February 2012 on  www.nytimes.com.  Retrieved 12 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicago Opera Theater presented a production in 1990.

The [[Dallas Opera]] gave three performances of the work as part of its "Chamber Opera Series" in March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dallasopera.org/season/2011-2012/lighthouse/  Detailed outline of the opera and its production staff on dallasopera.org]  Retrieved 12 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The opera opens with a prologue in which three officers (tenor, baritone and bass) address a board of inquiry. They relate their voyage to the dark lighthouse and the discovery that the crew was missing, but become increasingly nervous answering the questions put to them by the orchestra's French horn and begin to contradict each other on details. Nevertheless, an open verdict is recorded and the trio sing of the ghost's modern robot replacement.

The lantern comes up to full brightness and the second half, subtitled "The Cry of the Beast", opens in the lighthouse. Arthur (bass) is leading grace and Blazes (baritone) is complaining of the food and the overdue relief crew, while Sandy (tenor) tries to keep peace between the two. He proposes a game of [[cribbage|crib]], and the sanctimonious Arthur leaves to light the lantern, issuing dire predictions as the offstage Voice of the Cards. He returns just as a fight breaks out over a card palmed by Blazes. Sandy proposes they pass the time with songs "lest we end up like beasts in a cage, eating each other". Blazes agrees: "...then we shall see who is king, who devil, and who the fool amongst us." He sings first, with "When I was a kid our street had a gang". Accompanied by [[Bones (instrument)|'bones]], fiddle, and banjo, it relates a murder committed by Blazes, for which his father was arrested and hanged.

Sandy takes his turn with a sentimental love ballad accompanied by cello and piano. The three stanzas turn into a less innocent [[catch (music)|catch]] when taken up by the other two: "...O, that you held me...by the cock...I come...crowing loud...I am aroused". Arthur counters with a Salvation Army song on The Golden Calf (brass, clarinet and tambourine) in which he seems personally to glory in the smiting of the [[Levites]]. With dismay the three notice the fog coming in – the horn must now be started, summoning first the Blazes' ghosts, then Sandy's memories of his sister and a schoolmate. To Arthur, the horn summons the Golden Calf which he sees moving across the waters to claim them. "The only cure is to kill the beast!" he cries, enlisting the others to arm themselves and advance, singing a ''[[Psalm 130|De profundis]]'', into the night, toward its dazzling bright eye.

When the music calms, the light is seen to belong to the relief ship and the three relief officers are visible. "We had to defend ourselves, by God!" They agree on their story and tidy up quickly.

==Orchestra==
The six regular players of [[The Fires of London]] were augmented to 12 as follows: [[flute]] doubling [[piccolo]] and [[alto flute]], [[clarinet]] in A doubling [[bass clarinet]] in B{{music|♭}}; [[French horn|horn]] in F, [[trumpet]] in C, and [[trombone]]; solo strings ([[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], [[double bass]]); [[piano]] doubling [[celesta]] and out of tune [[upright piano]], [[guitar]] doubling [[banjo]].

The [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] comprised [[marimba]], [[glockenspiel]], [[timpani]], [[crotales]], [[rototom]], [[bass drum]], [[bones (instrument)|bones]], small [[suspended cymbal]], [[Snare drum|side drum]], [[tambourine]], [[maraca]]s, [[Tom-tom drum|tom-toms]] and [[Gong|tamtam]], all played by one percussionist, and in addition [[flexatone]] and referee's [[whistle]] (pianist), [[bass drum]] (guitarist), [[Gong|tamtam]] (violinist), and two more [[flexatone]]s (violist).

'''Titwrench''' Festival features women and [[LGBT|LGBTQIAP]] artists and musicians and other underrepresented/emerging artists pushing the boundaries of genre and form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Tom|title=A Look Back at the First Two Years of Titwrench Fest|date=2015|url=http://trespassingjournal.com/Issue2/TPJ_I2_Moravec_Article.pdf|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The festival began in 2009 as a showcase for the talent of female-identified people and those in the LGBTQIA communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wenzel|first=John|title=Female-centric-diy-titwrench-festival-returns

==Purpose==
Titwrench is a community-based organization that works to create and cultivate audiences and platforms in which the community can come together and celebrate and empower women and LGBTQIAP artists/musicians who are pushing the boundaries of genre and form. 
Titwrench seeks to cultivate community around these artists, advanced and unconventional music forms, feminist thought, art and ideas and inspire collaborative works among women and LGBTQIA communities in [[Denver]] and around the globe. 
Music should be accessible for all ages, gender identities and communities and they are actively working to create inclusive, fun, safe spaces for all participants of our events.

==History==
Founder Sarah Slater has long been an active participant in the local music and art community, and when she and former [[Denver Zine Library]] volunteer Kristy Fenton came up with the name and the concept for the initial festival, it was a natural next step for Slater's longstanding history of booking shows. Since the festival beginnings it has had many long standing volunteers and has moved through locations throughout Denver. 
In 2014 the festival took place in Stockholm.

'''United Nations Security Council resolution 549''', adopted on 19 April 1984, after recalling previous [[United Nations Security Council resolution|resolutions]] on the topic, as well as studying the report by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] on the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] (UNIFIL) approved in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 426|426]] (1978), the Council decided to extend the mandate of UNIFIL for a further six months until 19 October 1984.

The Council then reemphasised the mandate of the Force and requested the Secretary-General to report back on the progress made with regard to the implementation of the resolution.

Resolution 549 was adopted by 13 votes to none, with two [[abstention]]s from the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and [[Soviet Union]].
