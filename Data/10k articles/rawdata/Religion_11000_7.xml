'''Agathla Peak''' ({{lang-nv|Aghaałą́}}, {{lang-es|link=no|El Capitan}}) is a peak south of [[Monument Valley]], [[Arizona]], which rises over 1500 feet (457 meters) above the surrounding terrain. It is {{convert|7|mi}} north of [[Kayenta, Arizona|Kayenta]] and is visible from [[U.S. Route 163]]. The English designation ''Agathla'' is derived from the Navajo name ''{{spell-nv|aghaałą́}}'' meaning 'much wool', apparently for the fur of antelope and deer accumulating on the rock.&lt;ref name=gnis&gt;{{cite gnis|id=502|name=Agathla Peak|accessdate=October 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mountain is considered sacred by the Navajo.

Agathla Peak is an [[Erosion|eroded]] [[volcanic plug]] consisting of [[volcanic breccia]] cut by [[Dike (geology)|dikes]] of an unusual igneous rock called [[Lamprophyre|minette]]. It is one of many such volcanic [[diatreme]]s that are found in Navajo country of northeast Arizona and northwest New Mexico. Agathla Peak and [[Shiprock]] in New Mexico are the most prominent. These rocks are part of the Navajo Volcanic Field, in the southern [[Colorado Plateau]]. Ages of these minettes and associated more unusual igneous rocks cluster near 25 million years.

'''''All Gas and Gaiters''''' is a British television ecclesiastical sitcom which aired on [[BBC One|BBC1]] from 1966 to 1971. It was written by [[Pauline Devaney]] and [[Edwin Apps]], a husband-and-wife team who used the pseudonym of "John Wraith" when writing the pilot. ''All Gas and Gaiters'' was also broadcast on [[BBC Radio]] from 1971 to 1972.

==Cast==
*[[William Mervyn]] – Cuthbert Hever, [[Bishop]] of St Ogg's
*[[Robertson Hare]] – Henry Blunt, the [[archdeacon]]
*[[Derek Nimmo]] – Mervyn Noote, the [[Bishop's Chaplain]]
*[[John Barron (actor)|John Barron]] – Lionel Pugh-Critchley, [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] of St Ogg's (pilot, series 1 and 4)
*[[Ernest Clark]] – Lionel Pugh-Critchley, Dean of St Ogg's (1968 special, series 2 and 3)
*[[Joan Sanderson]] – Grace Pugh-Critchley, the Dean's wife
*[[Ruth Kettlewell]] – Grace Pugh-Critchley, the Dean's wife (early episodes)

==Plot==
''All Gas and Gaiters'', predominantly [[farce|farcical]] in nature, was set in the close of the fictional St Ogg's Cathedral and concerned various intrigues and rivalries among the clergy. The "gaiters" in the title refers to part of the [[Gaiters#In the Anglican church|traditional dress]] of bishops and archdeacons. The title itself, however, is a reference to a well-known phrase from [[Charles Dickens]]' 1839 novel ''[[Nicholas Nickleby]]'', later used by [[P. G. Wodehouse]] and by [[Powell and Pressburger]] (spoken in the film ''[[The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp]]''), although it had at that time a different meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-gas1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The bishop was easygoing; his friend the archdeacon was elderly, tippling, and still appreciative of attractive women; and the bishop's chaplain was naïve and accident-prone. Their wish to live a quiet bachelor life was continually threatened by the overbearing [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]], who tried to bring by-the-book rule to the cathedral.

The series initially aroused some controversy because of its portrayal of senior clergy as bungling incompetents, although some clergy enjoyed it. In the opening credits, [[St Albans Cathedral]] was shown as the fictional St Ogg's, but with the twisted spire of [[Church of St Mary and All Saints, Chesterfield]] added to the central tower. The background to the opening credits was the headmaster's garden of St. Albans School. The name "St. Ogg's" may have been taken from a fictional village in George Eliot's novel ''[[The Mill on the Floss]]''.

It proved to be the first of a series of comedies starring [[Derek Nimmo]] in similar bumbling clerical roles—(''[[Oh, Brother!]]'', ''Oh, Father!'' and ''[[Hell's Bells (TV series)|Hell's Bells]]'')—but is regarded as the best, partly because of a strong supporting cast (particularly the experienced ''[[farce]]ur'' [[Robertson Hare]] as the [[archdeacon]]) and partly because it included some elements of gentle satire.&lt;ref&gt;Sangster and Condon ''TV Heaven''.&lt;/ref&gt;

All 11 surviving episodes were released on DVD by DD Home Entertainment in 2004, originally accompanied by a detailed behind-the-scenes booklet, written by Andy Priestner in consultation with the show's writers, Edwin Apps and Pauline Devaney, but later released without. [[2 Entertain|Cinema Club]] have since bought the DVD rights.

Eight scripts of the lost episodes were published in 2015: ''All Gas and Gaiters, the Lost Episodes: Tome 1'' ({{ISBN|978-1-910317-02-0}}): "Only Three Can Play", "The Dean Goes Primitive", "The Bishop Goes To Town", "The Bishop Learns the Facts", "The Bishop is Hospitable", "The Bishop Takes a Holiday", "The Affair at Cookham Lock" and "The Bishop Gives a Shove".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.durpey-allen.co.uk/crbst_12.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Episodes==
The pilot and first three series were videotaped in [[black-and-white]]. The third series was taped in colour, but originally broadcast in [[monochrome]]. The fourth and fifth series were made and shown in colour. Only 11 episodes still exist in the archive, owing to the [[wiping]] policy of the BBC in this era. Two of the colour episodes from series 5 are preserved as black and white 16mm film recordings only (three earlier episodes were always black and white). Only six colour episodes are preserved in their original colour videotape format.

==''Christmas Night with the Stars''==
''[[Christmas Night with the Stars]]'' was a programme screened annually on Christmas night, when the top stars of the BBC appeared in short versions of their programmes, typically five to ten minutes long. ''All Gas and Gaiters'' appeared once alongside its sitcom spin-off ''Oh, Brother!'' in 1968. This telerecording no longer exists in the BBC's film and videotape archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lostshows.com/default.aspx?episode=bb34187f-677a-4987-8f7d-b3b6b9410560|title=Lost Shows page on All Gas And Gaiters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
A radio version of ''All Gas and Gaiters'' was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] from 5 January 1971 to 4 December 1972 for 33 episodes. The radio show used the same cast as the television series with the exception of Derek Nimmo, who left after the first series and was succeeded by [[Jonathan Cecil]]. Although seven radio episodes were thought to have been wiped, these were later found and all are available through radio enthusiasts. Some episodes were rebroadcast on [[BBC 7]] in October and November 2006, and again a year later and in early 2009. They continued to be broadcast on the station, now renamed [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]], in August 2011 and again in early 2017.

[[File:Cecil Chesterton.jpg|thumb|right|Cecil Chesterton in uniform]]
'''Cecil Edward Chesterton''' (12 November 1879 – 6 December 1918) was an English journalist and political commentator, known particularly for his role as editor of ''[[The New Witness]]'' from 1912 to 1916, and in relation to its coverage of the [[Marconi scandal]].

==Life==
He was the younger brother of [[G. K. Chesterton]], and a close associate of [[Hilaire Belloc]]. While the ideas of [[distributism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu:8081/exist/mjp/display.xq?docid=mjp.2005.00.081 MJP Text Viewer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; came from all three, and [[Arthur Penty]], he was the most ideological and combative by temperament. His death, according to his widow, removed the theorist of the movement.

He was born in [[Kensington]], London, and educated at [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]], then worked for a small publisher for a time.  He then qualified as surveyor and estate agent, with a view to entering his father's business, which is still flourishing today. In 1901 he joined the [[Fabian Society]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu:8081/exist/mjp/plookup.xq?id=ChestertonCecil Chesterton, Cecil (1879–1918)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; with which he was closely involved for about six years. From 1907 he wrote for [[A. R. Orage]]'s ''[[The New Age]]''. In 1908 he published an anonymous biography of his better-known brother, ''G. K. Chesterton, a Criticism'', but his authorship was quickly discovered.

He had been one of the 'Anti-Puritan League' of the 1890s, with [[Stewart Headlam]] (who stood bail for [[Oscar Wilde]]), [[Edgar Jepson]] and his brother; and then a member of [[Sir Henry Holland, 1st Baronet|Henry Holland]]'s [[Christian Social Union (U.K.)|Christian Social Union]]. While Chesterton was writing from a socialist point of view for Orage, he was also moving to an Anglo-Catholic religious stance. In 1911 he started editorial work for Belloc, with whom he wrote in ''The Party System'', a criticism of [[party politics]]. In 1912 he formally became a [[Roman Catholic]].

That same year he bought Belloc's failing weekly ''[[The Eye-Witness|Eye-Witness]]''; [[Charles Granville]] who published it had been made bankrupt. He renamed it ''The New Witness'', editing it for four years before enlisting in the army, and turning it into a [[scandal sheet]]. His persistent attacks on prominent political figures involved in the [[Marconi scandal]] (such as Lloyd George), and his public defence of his position in terms of a 'Jewish problem', have left him with a reputation as an anti-Semite. He was successfully brought to court by [[Godfrey Isaacs]],&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, Frances (2011). "Ghastly Record: Isaacs vs. Chesterton." In: ''The Marconi Scandal.'' Bloomsbury Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; one of those attacked, although the damages awarded were nominal. A government investigation revealed that high government officials had engaged in [[insider trading]] in the stock of Marconi's American subsidiary, but the quantity of stocks they were known to have purchased was relatively small.

In 1916 he married journalist [[Ada Elizabeth Chesterton|Ada Elizabeth Jones]], later known as a writer, after a long courtship.&lt;ref name=ada&gt;Mark Knight, 'Chesterton , Ada Elizabeth (1869–1962)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2014 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39077, accessed 28 Feb 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Highland Light Infantry]] as a private soldier. His brother Gilbert took over the paper, with Ada as Secretary and Business Manager. Eventually in 1925 Gilbert, with great reluctance, allowed it to be renamed ''[[G. K.'s Weekly]]'' because his name was very well-known and likely to attract interest.

He was three times wounded fighting in France, and died there in a hospital of [[nephritis]] on 6 December 1918. His wife Ada had rushed to his bedside and she arrived just before he died. She was his only relative at his funeral.&lt;ref name=ada/&gt; Although sick, he had refused to leave his post until the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice]]. On 13 December, G. K. Chesterton would report his death in the ''New Witness'', noting that "He lived long enough to march to the victory which was for him a supreme vision of liberty and the light."

'''''La Chasse-galerie''''' also known as "The Bewitched Canoe" or "The Flying Canoe" is a popular [[French-Canadian]] tale of ''[[Coureur des bois|Coureurs des bois]]'' who make a deal with the [[devil]], a variant of the [[Wild Hunt]]. Its best-known version was written by [[Honoré Beaugrand]] (1848–1906). It was published in ''[[The Century Magazine]]'' in August 1892.

== Origin ==
The story can be traced back to a [[France|French]] legend about a rich nobleman named Gallery who loved to hunt. He loved it so much that he refused to attend [[Sunday mass]]. As punishment for this sin he was condemned to fly forever through the night skies, chased by galloping horses and howling wolves, in a fashion reminiscent of the Wild Hunt.

When French settlers arrived in [[Canada, New France|Canada]], they swapped stories with the natives and the tale of Gallery was combined with a [[First Nations]] legend about a flying canoe.

== Variations ==
After a night of heavy drinking on [[New Year's Eve]], a group of [[Coureur des bois#Voyageurs|voyageurs]] working at a remote timber camp want to visit their sweethearts some 100 leagues away (300 miles). The only way to make such a long journey and be back in time for work the next morning is to run the ''chasse-galerie''. Running the ''chasse-galerie'' means making a pact with the devil so their canoe can fly through the air to their destination quickly. However, the travellers must not mention God's name or touch the cross of any church steeple as they whisk by in the flying canoe. If either of these rules is broken during the voyage, then the devil will take their souls. To be safe, the men promise not to touch another drop of rum to keep their heads clear. The crew took their places in the canoe which then rises off the ground, and they start to paddle. Far below they see the frozen [[Gatineau River]], many villages, shiny church steeples and then the lights of [[Montreal]]. The bewitched canoe eventually touches down near a house where New Year's Eve festivities are in full swing. No one wonders at the trappers'/loggers' sudden arrival. They are embraced with open arms and soon are dancing and celebrating as merrily as everyone else. Soon it is late and the men must leave if they are to get back to camp in time for work. As they fly through the moonless night, it becomes apparent that their navigator had been drinking as he steers the canoe on a dangerously unsteady course. While passing over Montreal they just miss running into a church steeple, and soon after the canoe ends up stuck in a deep snowdrift. At this point the drunken navigator begins swearing and taking the Lord's name in vain. Terrified the devil will take their souls, the men bind and gag their friend and elect another to steer. The navigator soon breaks his bonds and begins swearing again. The crew become more and more shaken at the possibility of losing their souls, and they eventually steer the bewitched canoe right into a tall pine. The men spill out and are knocked unconscious. The ending of the story changes from version to version. Sometimes the men are condemned to fly the canoe through hell and appear in the sky every New Year's Eve, but in all but one version all escape the terms the devil (Lucifer) made.

Several different versions of this tale exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allsands.com/travel/places/thewitchedcano_byu_gn.htm|title=French Canadian Legends—The Witched Canoe|publisher=AllSands.com|accessdate=2009-02-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194735/http://www.allsands.com/travel/places/thewitchedcano_byu_gn.htm#|archive-date=2016-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Acadian]] version involves an axe handle. It stretches to accommodate as many as climb on.

Another variation has the devil himself steering and deliberately trying to break the rules on the return journey, at which point they throw him out of the canoe to save themselves.

In English this particular legend is known as "The Canoe", or "The Wild Hunt Bewitched". The second name is used to translate precisely ''chasse-galerie'' as it is known in Canadian French; the other term is much broader.

In Quebec, the best-known version is written by [[Honoré Beaugrand]]. This is the story of the [[Gatineau]] loggers who make a pact with the devil in order to steal a boat so they can visit their women. They are warned, however, not to blaspheme during the voyage, or touch crosses atop church steeples, and they must be back before six o'clock the next morning. Otherwise they would lose their souls. In his version, the devil (Lucifer) is rather generous, and allows the men to return unhurt and undamaged.

The tale appeared in a book of French-Canadian folktales called ''Legends of French Canada'' by [[Edward C. Woodley]], published in 1931, republished in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWlnIGi4lvkC |title=Legends of French Canada|author=Edward Carruthers Woodley|publisher=B. Blom|year=1931|ISBN=0405091028 |accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tale is told as a recollection of one of the men who made ''chasse-galerie''. The men travel from [[Saint-Maurice (electoral district)|St. Maurice]] to [[Saint-Jean (electoral district)|St. Jeanne]]. The return accident is credited to ''[[Moonshine|whiskey-blanc]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Daily Life on the Old Colonial Frontier|first=James M.|last=Volo|author2=Dorothy Denneen Volo|page=178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYO1CM-W-dQC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;dq=whiskey-blanc| isbn=978-0-313-31103-1 | year=2002 | publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier volume in English, entitled ''The Flying Canoe (La Chasse-Galerie)'' was written by [[J.E. LeRossignol]], by [[McLelland and Steward]] Publishers in 1929. In it, thanks is given (with no further publication information) to "the Toronto ''[[Star Weekly]]'', and the ''[[Canadian Home Journal]]'' for their courteous permission to republish certain stories which appeared originally in these journals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Flying Canoe (La Chasse Galerie)|first=J.E.| last=LeRossignol| year= 1926| publisher= McLelland and Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a musical theatre version of the story was performed at the Storefront Theatre in Toronto, and won two Dora Awards and two Toronto Theatre Critics Awards.  A larger production was mounted in 2016 by Soulpepper Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/stage/2016/11/14/chasse-galerie-deserves-to-be-a-new-theatre-holiday-classic-review.html "Chasse-Galerie deserves to be a new theatre holiday classic: review"]. ''Toronto Star'', November 16, 2016.  Page E3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
A Canadian 40¢ [[postage stamp]] was issued in 1991 (as the Witched Canoe), illustrating this legend (Canadian Scott #1334 or #1445), which forms part of a series on Canadian [[Folklore|folktale]]s.

One of the oldest rides at Montreal's [[La Ronde (amusement park)|La Ronde]] amusement park, La Pitoune, uses this legend as inspiration. It is a basic sawmill log ride, but overhead is a representation of the flying canoe, with the devil perched behind the terrified men. The high bench at the back of the log-cars is therefore referred to as "the devil-seat."

The legend serves as the label motif for [[Unibroue#Beers|Maudite]], an ale produced by the [[Unibroue]] brewery of Quebec.

The [[National Film Board of Canada]] produced a short animated film of this ''The Legend of the Flying Canoe (La Chasse-galerie)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Robert Doucet (Director) |year=1996|title=La Légende du canot d'écorce  (La Chasse-galerie)|trans-title=The Legend of the Flying Canoe (La Chasse-galerie)|medium=Film |url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/legend_of_the_flying_canoe_la_chasse-galerie|archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |time=10 min 37 s |publisher=National Film Board of Canada|language=fr }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Claude Dubois]] sings a song called ''Chasse Galerie'' on album ''"Rencontre de rêves live (1992)."''

The Quebec folk band [[La Bottine Souriante]] published a song on this tale, ''Martin de la Chasse-Galerie'', in their album [[La Mistrine]] in 1994.

[[Montreal]] [[folk metal]] band Blackguard use an image of the flying canoe on the cover of their 2009 album ''[[Profugus Mortis (album)|Profugus Mortis]]''. Included on the album is a song called "The Last We Wage", whose lyrics are based on this legend.

During the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|Opening Ceremony for the 2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]], a canoe containing fiddler [[Colin Maier]] was lowered from the ceiling in an allusion to the legend.

The Flying Canoe also appears in [[Fredric Back]]'s 1981 animated film ''Crac''.&lt;ref name = Crac&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5TeYs0-slU|title=''Crac''|people=Frederic Back|year=1981|publisher=Societe Radio-Canada, a C.B.C.

==Adaptations==

'''Chhatris''' are elevated, dome-shaped [[pavilion]]s used as an element in [[Indian architecture]]. The word ''Chhatri'' means "canopy" or "umbrella." In the context of architecture, the word is used to refer to two different things. The usual and more widely understood meaning is of a memorial, usually very ornate, built over the site where the funeral (cremation) of an important personage was performed. Such memorials usually consist of a platform girded by a set of ornate pillars which hold up a stone canopy. The word ''chhatri'' is also used to refer to the small pavilions that mark the corners and roof of the entrance of a major building. These pavilions are purely decorative and have no utility, but are a classic [[folly]] displaying the status and wealth of the owner.

Chhatris are commonly used to depict the elements of pride and honour in [[Rajput]], [[Maratha]] and [[Jat]] architecture. They are widely used in palaces, in forts, or to demarcate funerary sites. Originating in [[Rajasthani architecture]] where they were memorials for royalty, they were later adapted as a standard feature in all buildings in [[Maratha]]-ruled states, [[Rajasthan]], and most importantly in [[Mughal architecture]]. The most notable surviving examples today are to be found at [[Humayun's Tomb]] in [[Delhi]] and the [[Taj Mahal]] in [[Agra]]. 

Chhatris in Shekhawati may consist of a simple structure of one dome raised by four pillars to a building containing many domes and a basement with several rooms. In some places, the interior of the chhatris is painted in the same manner as the [[Haveli]]s (Mansions) of the region.

==In Rajasthan==

[[Image:Cenotaph of Musi Maharani.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Moosi Rani Ki Chhatri, [[Alwar]]]]
Many other chhatris exist in other parts of Rajasthan. Their locations include:

*[[Jaipur]] – [[Gaitore]] Cenotaphs of the Maharajas of [[Jaipur]]. Set in a narrow valley, the cenotaphs of the former rulers of Jaipur consist of the somewhat typical chhatri or umbrella-shaped memorials. Sawai [[Jai Singh II]]'s Chhatri is particularly noteworthy because of the carvings that have been used to embellish it.
*[[Jodhpur]] – White marble Chhatri of Maharaja Jaswant Singh II
*[[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]]- the cenotaphs of the members of the Jat royal family of Bharatpur, who perished whilst fighting against the British in 1825, are erected in the town of [[Govardhan hill|Govardhan]]. The chhatri of [[Maharaja Suraj Mal]] of Bharatpur has fine frescos illuminating the life of Surajmal, vividly depicting darbar and hunting scenes, royal processions and wars.

== History ==
At age twenty, Lieb left his hometown of Fairfield, Iowa to pursue music professionally in [[New York City]].  In addition to attending classes at [[The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music|The New School]] and at [[Pepperdine University]], Lieb began singing at local [[open mic]] sessions, where he was introduced to Jonathan Daniel of [[Crush Management]].&lt;ref name="Fairfield"&gt;{{cite AV media |year=2012 |title=Fairfield 2.0 (Season 2, Episode 40) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxiejPjR05Y |accessdate=16 June 2014 |location=Fairfield, Iowa |publisher=Fairfield Media Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two began meeting with record labels and Lieb began collaborating with other songwriters.&lt;ref name="Fairfield"/&gt; In the course of these meetings, Lieb's father died and he abruptly ceased his music career.&lt;ref name="Fairfield"/&gt;  Lieb moved back to Fairfield and went more than three years without playing or writing a song.&lt;ref name="Fairfield"/&gt;

=== 2009–2011: Debut album===
In 2009, Lieb began recording covers of popular songs to [[YouTube]] from his home in Fairfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=On the Rise: Eli Lieb |url=http://peacetownusa.org/2010/11/on-the-rise-eli-lieb/ |website=Peace Town USA |accessdate=15 June 2014 |date=22 Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His videos quickly began accruing a large number of views, and the positive response he received online encouraged him to release his first album, the self-titled ''[[Eli Lieb (album)|Eli Lieb]],'' independently on October 25, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Wes |title=Eli Lieb: Album Review |url=http://www.kickkicksnare.com/2011/10/24/eli-lieb-album-review/ |website=KickKickSnare |accessdate=15 June 2014 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20120430224900/http://www.kickkicksnare.com/2011/10/24/eli-lieb-album-review/ |archive-date=April 30, 2012 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lieb wrote, recorded, and produced the album on his own in Fairfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Place of Paradise: Talking About Life &amp; Music with Singer Eli Lieb |url=http://pmc-mag.com/2012/04/eli-lieb/ |accessdate=31 July 2014 |date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2718">'''Gosains''', who are also known as '''Gossains''' and as '''Goswami''', are [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[ascetic]]s of India. The term can be translated as ''master of passion''.{{sfnp|Bayly|1988|p=477|ps=}} They are sometimes referred to more generally as ''[[Bairagi]]s'' or ''[[Sannyasa|Sannyasis]]''.{{sfnp|Bayly|1988|p=142|ps=}}

The Gosains were powerful nomadic and mercenary trading groups who undertook pilgrimages across significant areas of land. While early British colonists in [[Bengal Presidency]] considered them to be marauding robbers, similar to the [[Banjara]]s, they were also important to urban economies and the development of wider trade networks.{{sfnp|Bayly|1988|p=29|ps=}} These itinerant religious mendicant groups could be very large in number, with figures in excess of 50,000 being probable for those headed by figures such as [[Umrao Giri]] and [[Himmat Bahadur]] in the late 1700s.{{sfnp|Bayly|1988|p=126|ps=}} Their numerical strength enabled them to be self-protecting and also to protect the trade routes that they used, regardless of who might have titular power in any given place.{{sfnp|Bayly|1988|p=142|ps=}} Their movements were often dictated by religious festivals, both of a localised village nature and of a more widely celebrated type, such as [[Holi]]. As these festivals were also occasions for seasonal markets, so the Gosains were able to move and trade goods between areas.{{sfnp|Bayly|1988|p=128|ps=}}

The [[Nawab of Awadh|Nawabs of Awadh]], who ruled [[Oudh State]] in the 18th and 19th centuries and were [[Islam|Muslim]] successors to the [[Mughal empire]], recruited from Gosain martial brotherhoods as a way to assimilate influential Hindu elements of society and buttress their own sources of power. This attempt at creating a plural society was in sharp contrast to the zealotry that had characterised their predecessors.{{sfnp|Bayly|1988|pp=26, 142|ps=}}

{{History of Gujarat}}
The '''Gurjaras of Lata''', also known as '''Gurjaras of Nandipuri''' or '''Bharuch Gurjaras''', was a dynasty which ruled [[Lata (region)|Lata region]] (now [[South Gujarat]], India) as a feudatory of different dynasties from c. 580 CE to c. 738 CE.

==Sources of Information==
All the available information regarding the Bharuch Gurjaras comes from [[Indian copper plate inscriptions|copperplates]],&lt;ref&gt;The Indian Antiquary V. 109ff; The Indian Antiquary VII. 61ff.; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (N. S.), I. 274ff.; The Indian Antiquary XIII. 81–91; Journal of Bombay Branch Royal Asiatic Society X. 19ff.; The Indian Antiquary XIII. 115–119. The Indian Antiquary XVII. and Epigraphica Indica II. 19ff.&lt;/ref&gt; all obtained from South Gujarat. Like the grants of the contemporary [[Chalukya]]s all the genuine copperplates are dated in the Traikúṭaka era which begins in 249–50 CE. The Gurjara capital seems to have been Nāndīpurī or Nāndor, the modern [[Nandod]] near [[Bharuch]]. Two of their grants issue Nāndīpurītaḥ that is 'from Nāndīpurī’, a phrase which seems to show the place named was the capital since in other Gurjara grants the word ''vāsaka'' or camp occurs.&lt;ref name="GBP"&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[James Macnabb Campbell]]|title=History of Gujarát|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/54652/54652-h/54652-h.htm|series=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency|volume=Volume I. Part I.|year=1896|publisher=The Government Central Press|pages=114–120|chapter=I.THE GURJJARAS (A. D. 580–808.)}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rule==
These copperplates limit the regular Gurjara territory to the Bharuch district between the [[Mahi River|Mahi]] and the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] rivers, though at times their power extended north to [[Kheda district|Kheḍā]] and south to the [[Tapi River, India|Tāpti river]].&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

Though the Gurjaras held a considerable territory in South Gujarat their plates seem to show they were not independent rulers. The general titles are either ''Samadhigata-panchamahāśabada'' 'He who has attained the five great titles,’ or ''Sāmanta'' Feudatory. In one instance Jayabhaṭa III who was probably a powerful ruler is called ''Sāmantādhipati'' Lord of Feudatories. It is hard to say to what suzerain these Broach Gurjaras acknowledged fealty. Latterly they seem to have accepted the [[Chalukya]]s on the south as their overlords. But during the greater part of their existence they may have been feudatory of the [[Maitraka]] dynasty.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

==History==
The origin of dynasty is not known. They probably originated from the neighboring dynasty, Gurjaras of Mandor or Bhinmal.&lt;ref name=Virji&gt;{{cite book|last=Virji|first=Krishnakumari Jethabhai|title=Ancient history of Saurashtra: being a study of the Maitrakas of Valabhi V to VIII centuries A. D.|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.57287|series=Indian History and Culture Series|year=1955|publisher=Konkan Institute of Arts and Sciences|pages=126–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
A grant&lt;ref&gt;Epigraphica Indica II. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; made by Nirihullaka, the chieftain of a forest tribe in the lower valley of the Narmada, shows that towards the end of the sixth century CE that region was occupied by forest tribes who acknowledged the supremacy of the [[Kalachuri dynasty]]; a fact which accounts for the use of the Chedi or Traikúṭaka era in South Gujarāt. Nirihullaka names with respect a king Śaṅkaraṇa, identified with Śaṅkaragaṇa (r. c. 575-600 CE) of [[Kalachuri dynasty]] and the Gurjara conquest must be subsequent to this date. Another grant,&lt;ref&gt;Epigraphica Indica II. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; which is only a fragment and contains no king’s name, but which on the ground of date ([[Samvat]] 346 = 594–5 CE) and style may be safely attributed to the Gurjara dynasty, shows that the Gurjaras were established in the country within a few years of Śaṅkaragaṇa’s probable date.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

A still nearer approximation to the date of the Gurjara conquest is suggested by the change in the titles of Dharasena I of [[Maitraka]] dynasty, who in his grants of Saṃvat 252&lt;ref&gt;The Indian Antiquary VII. 68, VIII. 302, XIII. 160, and XV. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; (571 CE) calls himself Mahārāja, while in his grants of 269 and 270&lt;ref&gt;The Indian Antiquary VI. 9, VII. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; (588 and 589 CE), he adds the title of Mahāsāmanta, which points to subjection by some foreign power between 571 and 588 CE. It seems highly probable that this power was that of the Gurjaras of Bhīnmāl; and that their successes therefore took place between 580 and 588 CE or about 585 CE.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

===Dadda I===
The above-mentioned anonymous grant of the year 346 (CE 594–95) from [[Sankheda]] is ascribed with great probability to Dadda I. who is known from the two Kheḍā grants of his grandson Dadda II. (C. 620–650 CE)&lt;ref&gt;The Indian Antiquary XIII. 81–88.&lt;/ref&gt; to have “uprooted the Nāga” who may be the same as the forest tribes ruled by Nirihullaka (possibly later represented by the Nāikdās of the Panchmahāls and the Talabdas or Locals of Bharuch).&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

The northern limit of Dadda’s kingdom seems to have been the [[Vindhya]], as the grant of 380 (CE 628–29) says that the lands lying around the feet of the Vindhya were for his pleasure. At the same time it appears that part at least of Northern Gujarāt was ruled by the Mahāsāmanta Dharasena of Maitraka dynasty, who in Val. 270 (589–90 CE) granted a village in the ''āhāra'' (province) of Kheṭaka (Kheḍā).&lt;ref&gt;The Indian Antiquary VII. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Dadda is always spoken of as the Sāmanta, which shows that while he lived his territory remained a part of the Gurjara kingdom of Bhīnmāl. Subsequently, North Gujarāt fell into the hands of the Mālava kings, to whom it belonged in [[Xuanzang|Hiuen Tsiang]]’s time (c. 640 CE). In Tsiang's accounts, Po-lu-ka-cha-po (Bharigukacchapa or Bhrigukaccha, i.e., [[Bharuch]]) is mentioned.  Dadda I. is mentioned in the two Kheḍā grants of his grandson as a worshipper of the sun: the fragmentary grant of 346 (594–95 CE) which is attributed to him gives no historical details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Kanauj: To the Moslem Conquest|author=Rama Shankar Tripathi|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|year=1989|id={{ISBN|812080404X}}, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0404-3}}|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Tnh2QjGhMQC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mishra1977" /&gt;

===Jayabhata I===
Dadda I was succeeded by his son Jayabhaṭa I who is mentioned in the Kheḍā grants as a victorious and virtuous ruler, and appears from his title of ''Vītarāga'' the Passionless to have been a religious prince.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

===Dadda II===
Jayabhaṭa I. was succeeded by his son Dadda II who bore the title of ''Praśāntarāga'', the Passion-calmed. Dadda was the donor of the two Kheḍā grants of 380 (628–29 CE) and 385 (633–34 CE), and a part of a grant made by his brother Raṇagraha in the year 391 (639–40 CE) has been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;The Indian Antiquary XIII. 81–88, Epigraphica Indica II. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of the Kheḍā grants relate to the gift of the village of Sirīshapadraka (Sisodra) in the Akrúreśvara ([[Ankleshwar]]) ''vishaya'' to certain Brāhmans of [[Jambusar]] and Bharuch. In Raṇagraha's grant the name of the village is lost.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

Dadda II’s own grants describe him as having attained the five great titles, and praise him in general terms: and both he and his brother Raṇagraha sign their grants as devout worshipers of the sun. Dadda II heads the genealogy in the later grant of 456 (704–5 CE),&lt;ref&gt;The Indian Antiquary XIII. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; which states that he protected "the lord of Valabhi [Dhruvasena II] who had been defeated by the great lord the illustrious Harshadeva." The event referred to must have been some expedition of [[Harsha]] of [[Kanauj]] ([[Vardhana dynasty]]) (607–648 CE), perhaps the campaign in which Harsha was defeated on the Narmada by [[Pulakeshin II]] of [[Chalukya dynasty]] (which took place before 634 CE). The protection given to the Valabhi king is perhaps referred to in the Kheḍā grants in the mention of "strangers and suppliants and people in distress." If this is the case the defeat of Valabhi took place before 628–29 CE, the date of the earlier of the Kheḍā grants. On the other hand, the phrase quoted is by no means decisive, and the fact that in Hiuen Tsiang’s time Dhruvasena II of Valabhi was son-in-law of Harsha’s son, makes it unlikely that Harsha should have been at war with him. It follows that the expedition referred to may have taken place in the reign of Dharasena IV who may have been the son of Dhruvasena by another wife than Harsha’s granddaughter.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A comprehensive history of ancient India|author=Pran Nath Chopra|publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt.

To Dadda II’s reign belongs Hiuen Tsiang’s notice of the kingdom of Bharuch (C. 640 CE). He says "all their profit is from the sea" and describes the country as salt and barren, which is still true of large tracts in the west and twelve hundred years ago was probably the condition of a much larger area than at present. Hiuen Tsiang does not say that Broach was subject to any other kingdom, but it is clear from the fact that Dadda bore the five great titles that he was a mere feudatory. At this period the valuable port of Bharuch, from which all their profit was made, was a prize fought for by all the neighbouring powers. With the surrounding country of Lāṭa, Bharuch submitted to Pulakeśin II. (610–640 CE),&lt;ref&gt;The Indian Antiquary VIII. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; it may afterwards have fallen to the Mālawa kings, to whom in Hiuen Tsiang’s time (640 CE) both Kheḍā (K’i.e.-ch’a) and Ánandapura ([[Vadnagar]]) belonged; later it was subject to Valabhi, as Dharasena IV made a grant at Bharuch in VS 330 (649–50 CE).&lt;ref&gt;The Indian Antiquary XV. 335.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

The knowledge of the later Gurjaras is derived exclusively from two grants of Jayabhaṭa III dated respectively 456 (704–5 CE) and 486 (734–5 CE).&lt;ref&gt;The Indian Antiquary V. 109, XIII. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; The later of these two grants is imperfect, only the last plate having been preserved. The earlier grant of 456 (704–5 CE) shows that during the half century following the reign of Dadda II the dynasty had ceased to call themselves Gurjaras, and had adopted a Purāṇic pedigree traced from [[Karna]] of ''[[Mahabharata]]''. It also shows that from Dadda III onward the family were [[Shaiva|Śaiva]]s instead of sun-worshipers.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

===Jayabhata II===
The successor of Dadda II was his son Jayabhaṭa II who is described as a warlike prince, but of whom no historical details are recorded.&lt;ref name="GBP"/&gt;

===Dadda III===
Jayabhaṭa’s son, Dadda III ''Bāhusahāya'' is described as waging wars with the great kings of the east and of the west (probably Mālava and Valabhi). He had received title of ''Bāhusahāya'' to for showing valour of his arms in fights with suzerain of east and west. He was Śaiva. Like his predecessors, Dadda III was not an independent ruler. He could claim only the five great titles, though no hint is given who was his suzerain. His immediate superior may have been Jayasimhavarma, who received the province of Lāṭa from his brother [[Vikramaditya I]] of [[Chalukya]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Bombay Branch.

Vajjada may be another name of Dadda III or another king of that name had invaded his state and was defeated by Jayasimhavarma.&lt;ref name="Mishra1977" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rcm" /&gt;

===Jayabhata III===
The son and successor of Dadda III was Jayabhaṭa III whose two grants of 456 (704–5 CE) and 486 (734–5 CE)&lt;ref&gt;The Indian Antiquary V. 109, XIII. 70. The earlier grant was made from Káyávatára (Karwan/[[Kayavarohan]]): the later one is mutilated.&lt;/ref&gt; must belong respectively to the beginning and the end of his reign. He attained the five great titles, and was therefore a feudatory, probably of the Chālukyas: but his title of ''Mahāsāmantādhipati'' implies that he was a chief of importance. He is praised in vague terms, but the only historical event mentioned in his grants is a defeat of a Maitraka ruler of Valabhi, noted in the grant of 486 (734–5 CE). The Maitraka king referred to must be Śīlāditya IV (691 CE).&lt;ref name="GBP" /&gt;

=== Ahirole ===
Jayabhata III was succeeded by Ahirole. He ruled till c. 720 CE.&lt;ref name="Mishra1977" /&gt;

===Jayabhata IV===
Ahirole's son Jayabhata IV's copperplate states that he defeated the Arabs fighting for the [[Ummayad Caliphate]] at [[Valabhi]], the capital of his probable overlords, the Maitrakas, in the year 735-36 CE. He assumed title of ''Mahasamanradhipati''. He must be fuedatory of Maitraka ruler Shiladitya IV or Shiladitya V as he had helped his suzerain Maitrakas in battle. Majumdar had suggested that he may have helped as a feudatory of Chalukyas.&lt;ref name="rcm"&gt;{{cite book|last=Majumdar|first=R.

[[File:Parmarth4.jpg|thumb|300px|Guru teaching students in a gurukula]]

A '''{{lang|sa-Latn|gurukula}}''' or '''{{lang|sa-Latn|gurukulam}}''' ({{lang-sa|गुरुकुल|gurukula}}) was a type of residential education system in [[ancient India]] with {{lang|sa-Latn|shishya}} ('students' or 'disciples') living near or with the [[guru]], in the same house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Yin Cheong Cheng |editor2=Kwok Tung Tsui |editor3=King Wai Chow|editor4=Magdalena Mo Ching Mok | year=2002| title=Subject Teaching and Teacher Education in the New Century: Research and Innovation | publisher=Springer |isbn=962-949-060-9 |page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[guru-shishya tradition]] is a sacred one in [[Hinduism]] and appears in other religious groups in India, such as [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Sikhism]]. The word {{lang|sa-Latn|gurukula}} is a combination of the Sanskrit words {{lang|sa-Latn|guru}} ('teacher' or 'master') and {{lang|sa-Latn|[[Kaula (Hinduism)|kula]]}} ('family' or 'home').&lt;ref name=ITGurugram/&gt;&lt;ref name=Edu1&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/4378166/Gurukula_A_Family_with_Difference_-_An_Exposition_of_the_Ancient_Indian_System_of_Education www.academia.edu - Gurukula: A Family with Difference - An Exposition of the Ancient Indian System of Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the British rule, they served as [[South Asia]]'s primary educational system. The term is also used today to refer to residential monasteries or schools operated by modern gurus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.jagran.com/uttar-pradesh/varanasi-city-14292578.html |title=नित्यानंद ने 70 लोगों को दी दीक्षा |trans-title=Nithyananda initiated 70 people |last=|first= |date= |work=Dainik Jagran |access-date=7 April 2018 |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url=no |language=hi |quote=...

In a {{lang|sa-Latn|gurukula}}, the students living together are considered as equals,&lt;ref name=AIJRHASS&gt;[http://iasir.net/AIJRHASSpapers/AIJRHASS13-140.pdf American International Journal of Research in Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences: Comparative study of ancient gurukula system and the new trend of guru-shishya parampara, ISSN (Online): 2328-3696, ISSN (CD-ROM): 2328-3688]&lt;/ref&gt; irrespective of their social standing.&lt;ref name=Edu1/&gt;&lt;ref name=AIJRHASS/&gt; They learn from the guru and help the guru in his everyday life, including carrying out of mundane daily household chores.

At the end of one's education, a {{lang|sa-Latn|shishya}} offers the guru {{lang|sa-Latn|[[dakshina]]}} before leaving the gurukula.&lt;ref name=Edu1/&gt;&lt;ref name=AIJRHASS/&gt; The {{lang|sa-Latn|gurudakshina}} is a traditional gesture of acknowledgment, respect and thanks to the guru, which may be monetary, but may also be a special task the teacher wants the student to accomplish.&lt;ref name=Edu1/&gt;&lt;ref name=AIJRHASS/&gt; While living in a {{lang|sa-Latn|gurukula}}, the students would be away from their home from a period of months to years at a stretch and disconnected from their family completely.

== History ==

[[File:Arya Samaj Gurukul School boys performing Homa ritual 1915.jpg|thumb]]

The {{lang|sa-Latn|gurukula}} system of education has been in existence since ancient times. The [[Upanishads]] mention multiple {{lang|sa-Latn|gurukulam}}, including that of guru [[Drona]] at [[Gurgaon]].&lt;ref name=ITGurugram&gt;[http://www.indiatimes.com/news/did-you-know-the-true-story-behind-gurugram-253390.html True story behind Gurugram]&lt;/ref&gt; The {{lang|sa-Latn|Bhrigu Valli}} (a discourse on the [[Brahman]]) is said to have taken place in Guru Varuni's {{lang|sa-Latn|gurukula}}. The vedic school of thought prescribes the {{lang|sa-Latn|gurukula|[[Upanayana]]}} (sacred rite of passage) to all individuals before the age of 8 at least by 12. From initiation until the age of 25 all individuals are prescribed to be students and to remain unmarried, a celibate.

{{lang|sa-Latn|Gurukulam}} were supported by public donations. This was followed by the many following Vedic thoughts making gurukula one of the earliest forms of public school centres.

== Revival of the {{lang|sa-Latn|gurukula}} system ==

By the colonial era, the {{lang|sa-Latn|gurukula}} system was on a steep decline in India. [[Dayananda Saraswati]], the founder of [[Arya Samaj]] and [[Swami Shraddhanand]], were the pioneers of the modern {{lang|sa-Latn|gurukula}} system, who in 1886 founded now-widespread [[D.A.V. College Managing Committee|Dayanand Anglo-Vedic Public Schools and Universities]].&lt;ref name=arya1&gt;Gurukula Patrika, April–July, 1940-41, Ank 10, (12 June 1940), P.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arya2&gt;Madalsa Ujjwal, 2008, "Swami Dayanand Saraswati Life and Ideas", Book Treasure Publications, Jodhpur, PP.96-97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arya3&gt;Gunjun H. Shakshi, 1971, "Social and Humanistic Life in India",  Abhinav Publications, Delhi, PP.122-124.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1948, Shastriji Maharaj Shree Dharamjivan das Swami followed suit and initiated first Swaminarayan {{lang|sa-Latn|gurukula}} in [[Rajkot]] in [[Gujarat]] state of [[India]]. Recently, several {{lang|sa-Latn|gurukulam}} have opened up in India as well as overseas with a desire to uphold tradition.

Today various {{lang|sa-Latn|gurukulam}} still exist in India, and researchers have been studying the effectiveness of the system through those institutions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Twelvers}}
A '''Hawza''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]/[[Persian language|Persian]]: حوزة) or '''ḥawza ʻilmiyya''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]/[[Persian language|Persian]]: حوزة علمیة) is a [[seminary]]  where [[Shi'a]] [[Muslim]] clerics are trained.&lt;ref name="ai-Hawza"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/index.php?t=258&amp;cat=258 |title=Hawza - Advanced Islamic Studies |publisher=Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308210212/http://www.al-islam.org/index.php?t=258&amp;cat=258 |archivedate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several senior [[Grand Ayatollahs]] constitute the hawza. The institutions in [[Najaf]], [[Iraq]] and [[Qom]], [[Iran]], are the preeminent seminary centers for the training of Shi'a [[clergymen]]. However, several smaller hawzas exist in other cities around the world, such as at [[Karbala]], [[Iraq]], [[Isfahan]] and [[Mashhad]] in [[Iran]], [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], [[Lucknow]], [[India]], [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]], Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-islam.org/hawza/faq.htm Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on Hawza Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426132358/http://www.al-islam.org/hawza/faq.htm |date=2010-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hawza 'Ilmiyya Qom==
Although big [[Shi'a]] academies existed in [[Qom]] dating back as early as 10th century CE,&lt;ref name="NTU"/&gt; the hawza of the city became prominent at the time of the [[Safavids]] when [[Shi'a Islam]] became the official religion of Iran. The famous teachers of that era included [[Mulla Sadra]] and [[Shaykh Bahai]].&lt;ref&gt;تاریخ مذهبی قم، ص 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;کتاب النقض، عبدالجلیل بن ابی الفتح، ص 164؛ تاریخ مذهبی قم، علی اصغر فقیهی، قم، چ حکمت، ص 167.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern [[Qom hawza]] was revitalized by [[Abdul Karim Haeri Yazdi]] and [[Grand Ayatollah Borujerdi]] and is barely a century old.&lt;ref name="S&amp;D"/&gt; There are nearly three hundred thousand clerics in Iran’s seminaries.&lt;ref name="C&amp;S"&gt;[http://www.thecuttingedgenews.com/index.php?article=12421&amp;pageid=20&amp;pagename=Security A History of Tension between Iran's Clerics and the State], Mehdi Khalaji July 26th 2010 Washington Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hawza 'Ilmiyya Khwaharān (Women's Hawza)==
There are also a number of women's hawza, mostly located in [[Iran]]. Already in the early 1800s, the [[Mulla_Muhammad_Salih_Baraghani|Salehiyya]] madrasa in [[Qazvin]] ran a women's section where several female [[mujtahid]]s were trained. In Qom, the earliest seminary for women was established by the grand ayatollah [[Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari]], who in 1973 added a women's section to his hawza [[Dar al-Tabligh]], called [[Dar al-Zahra]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael M. J. Fischer, ''Iran: From Religious Dispute to Revolution'',  Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press, 2003, p.196&lt;/ref&gt; Next, the [[Haghani school]] opened a women's wing in 1974/75, called [[Maktab-e Tawhid]].

Outside Qom, women's seminaries included Maktab-e Fatema of Fasa (opened in 1961), [[Maktab-e Zahra]] of Shiraz (opened in 1964), [[Maktab-e Fatimah]] of Isfahan (opened by [[Lady Amin]] in 1965),&lt;ref name=MK&gt;Mirjam Künkler and Roja Fazaeli, "The Life of Two Mujtahidas: Female Religious Authority in 20th Century Iran", in ''Women, Leadership and Mosques: Changes in Contemporary Islamic Authority'', ed. Masooda Bano and Hilary Kalmbach (Brill Publishers, 2012), 127–160. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1884209_code1321417.pdf?abstractid=1884209&amp;mirid=1&lt;/ref&gt; Zahra-i Athar of Tehran (opened in 1966), and [[Madrase-ye ‘Elmīyya Narges]] of Mashhad (opened in 1966).&lt;ref&gt; Keiko Sakurai, “Women’s empowerment and Iranian-style seminaries in Iran and Pakistan,” in Keiko Sakurai and Fariba Adelkhah (eds.), The Moral Economy of the Madrasa, Islam and Education Today, (Oxon &amp; New York: Routledge, 2011), p. 32-57&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1979 revolution]] in Iran, the state began to centralize the women's hawza system. The women's seminaries in Qom were centralized into one large school, the [[Jamiat al-Zahra]]. In Khorasan with its clerical center of Mashhad, the women's maktabs came under the aegis of the state-run Centre for Management of Women’s Seminaries of Khorasan. In the rest of the country, women's seminaries were integrated into the Centre for Management of Women’s Seminaries (Markaz-e Modiriat-e Ḥawzahā-ye ʿElmiyya Khwaharān). Since the mid-1990s the latter center has established more than 300 seminaries across Iran (before the revolution less than a dozen existed in the entire country).

==Hawza subjects==

Once the basic studies have been completed, students may begin preparation to become a [[mujtahid]] by studying advanced ancient textbooks known as ''sat'h'', and research courses known as ''kharij''.

To be a [[mujtahid]] one has to excel in the advanced levels of the Hawza including ''Muqad'dim'maat'', ''Sotooh'', ''Sotooh 'Ulya'', '' 'Uloom ukhra'' and ''Bahath Kharij''. 

''Bahath e Kharij'' is the last level of hawzah and this level leads to [[Marja' (Islamic law)|Marja'iya]], to become a [[Marja' (Islamic law)|marja']] one has to teach ''dars e khaarij'' for considerable amount of time, publish collection of juridical edicts (''risala ‘amaliyya'') and recognised as one (by established ''Maraji'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://imamshirazi.com/What%20is%20Islam.pdf What is Islam?

The '''House of Religions''' (German: ''Haus der Religionen''; French: ''Maison des religions'') is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] inter-religious institution in the city of [[Bern]] in Switzerland that houses worship rooms for eight faiths in one single building.&lt;ref&gt;Marc-André Miserez, [http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/house-of-religions_bringing-the-world-s-religions-together-in-bern/41162364 "Bringing the world’s religions together in Bern"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331070544/http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/house-of-religions_bringing-the-world-s-religions-together-in-bern/41162364 |date=31 March 2015 }}, [[Swissinfo]], 14 December 2014 (page visited on 16 May 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the 2000s started the plans to establish a cultural institution of Jewish, Christian, Islamic, Buddhist and Hindu faith traditions, and on 25 April 2002 the association "Haus der Religionen – Dialog der Kulturen" (meaning House of religions, dialogue of cultures) was established. In March 2006 the "Stiftung Europaplatz" foundation was founded, which raised the necessary funds for the project, including sacred spaces, among others for Hindu and Buddhist communities, of the Alevis and the Council of Christian Churches in the canton of Bern (AKB). In the beginning, the Jewish community of Bern and the [[Bahá'í Faith]] community did not wish to set up own rooms, but ideally supported the project. The cantonal Islamic ''Umma'' association has withdrawn from the project after initial concessions, but the Muslim association Hochfeldstrasse, however, was interested to participate.&lt;ref name="hdr-überuns"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haus-der-religionen.ch/de/aktuell/presse|title=Die drei Säulen einer Vision|publisher=Official website|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2014-12-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216230746/https://www.haus-der-religionen.ch/de/aktuell/presse|archivedate=16 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Building ==
The building includes, besides the house of religions, 88 apartments, shops, catering services and offices on a floor area of approximately {{convert|30000|m2|sqyd|0}}.&lt;ref name="hdr-europaplatz"/&gt; The location ''Europaplatz'' is situated in Bern-Ausserholligen, and served by S-Bahn, Tram Bern West, bus lines and the motorway junction. The Bern main train station and the city centre are accessible in a few minutes. 

The city of Bern granted planning permission for the project in April 2007 with a cost of about 50 million Swiss Francs, of which about 15 million Swiss Francs were related to the ''Haus der Religionen''. The construction was delayed several times, but the ground-breaking ceremony took place on 27 June 2012. On 14 December 2014 the building was inaugurated and opened for the public use.&lt;ref name="10vor10-20141212"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srf.ch/player/tv/10vor10/video/10vor10-vom-12-12-2014?id=b082cfcb-b032-4725-bfc9-d761399c5e0b|title=Haus der Religionen|publisher=[[10vor10]]|author=|language=German|date=2014-12-15|accessdate=2014-12-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108020721/http://www.srf.ch/player/tv/10vor10/video/10vor10-vom-12-12-2014?id=b082cfcb-b032-4725-bfc9-d761399c5e0b|archivedate=8 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inauguration ==
Christians, Alevis, Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists in their church, [[Dargah]], mosque, temples and centre now celebrate their cults. The religious communities celebrated the indentation in the newly built glass building on the ''Europaplatz'' square in the west of Bern on 14 December 2014 with thousands of visitors. ''While religious wars play anywhere in the world, we here get the opportunity to get to know other religions'', a [[Sikhism|Sikh]] visitor told, and a [[Hinduism|Krishna]] monk tells in the Mosque, ''that [[Islam|Muslims]] pray daily five times, is discipline for my own religion''. A young Albanian Muslim family is pleased with the open setting in the house: "I'm hip-hopper, my wife wears a headscarf. No reasons to condemn a people are both". And the non-denominational fellow hopes, "the House can help to break down stereotypes".&lt;ref name="20min-20141214"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.20min.ch/schweiz/bern/story/Weltweit-einziges--Haus-der-Religionen--eroeffnet-30286840?redirect=mobi&amp;nocache=0.2567775482311845|title=Weltweit einziges "Haus der Religionen" eröffnet: Das international einmalige Haus der Religionen öffnete am Sonntag seine Pforten.

Some of these religious communities lived so far in back yards or basements. The foundation provided funding to the (as of December 2014) five religious communities, and had to provide for the interior fittings and payments of the rental fees. Also the Bernese Jews, Bahá'i, and Sikhs are members of the association, which operates the house.&lt;ref name="20min-20141214"/&gt;

== Aims ==
The House of religions is used by cultural and religious communities of the city and the canton of Bern that previously had no rooms adapted to their needs. They represent Alevi, Christian, Islamic, Buddhist and Hindu faiths. Partners in the dialogue are also the Jewish community, the Baha'is and Sikhs. A dialogue of cultures, access to experience, knowledge and spirituality of other cultures and religions are taught, as they have been found in the Bern region their home. Haus der Religionen will provide a center of excellence for dialogue its services. Everyone involved in the project knows the inviolable dignity of the human being, the idea of tolerance and mutual respect obliged.&lt;ref name="hdr-überuns"/&gt; ''We were dreamers, utopians, do-gooders far from any reality'', said Guido Albisetti, president of the association. But now the ''Haus der Religionen'' is built, and past experience showed that the common dialog is possible and fruitful.&lt;ref name="20min-20141214"/&gt;

According to the operators, the architecture of the building allows the various communities to engage with each other, but also to withdraw. The building's design enables that the sacred spaces on either side of a so-called ''dialog area'' are accessible to everyone, and therefore are arranged on two floors.&lt;ref name="20min-20141214"/&gt;

== Common space ==
Immediately after the opening ceremony the versatile cultural program was launched, lasting until March 2015 opening events. The restaurant ''Vanakam'' is the central meeting place, where every day different delicacies are prepared, so also an [[Ayurveda]] vegetarian lunch.&lt;ref name="hdr-kath"/&gt; Of the eight religions, five have set up own prayer rooms, connected by ''dialog zones''.&lt;ref name="hdr-regionaljournal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srf.ch/sendungen/regionaljournal-bern-freiburg-wallis/jetzt-wartet-auf-das-haus-der-religionen-die-arbeit|title=Das "Haus der Religionen" in Bern ist eröffnet|publisher=Regionaljournal Bern Freiburg Wallis SRF 1|author=|language=German|date=2014-12-14|accessdate=2014-12-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118210436/http://www.srf.ch/sendungen/regionaljournal-bern-freiburg-wallis/jetzt-wartet-auf-das-haus-der-religionen-die-arbeit|archivedate=18 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two largest facilities will be the mosque with about {{convert|500|m2|sqyd|0}} and the Hindu temple with about {{convert|800|m2|sqyd|0}}. Alevis, Christians and Buddhists claim space in the size of {{convert|160|m2|sqyd|0}} to {{convert|180|m2|sqyd|0}}. The public part with infrastructure, cafeteria, exhibition, course and event spaces comprise about {{convert|1300|m2|sqyd|0}}.&lt;ref name="hdr-bz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bernerzeitung.ch/region/bern/Grosser-Brocken-fuer-die-kleinen-------Gemeinschaften-im-Haus-der-Religionen/story/28345401|title=Grosser Brocken für die kleinen Gemeinschaften im Haus der Religione|publisher=[[Berner Zeitung]] BZ|author=Hannah Einhaus|language=German|date=2012-07-12|accessdate=2014-12-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220141242/http://www.bernerzeitung.ch/region/bern/Grosser-Brocken-fuer-die-kleinen-------Gemeinschaften-im-Haus-der-Religionen/story/28345401|archivedate=20 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rooms of the faiths ==
=== Alevites ===
''Förderverein Alevitische Kultur'' represents the Alevite faith. Primarily important is that people feel comfortable, and the ritual small fire pit will be a symbol of purity. In addition to the meeting and prayer room with seating for about 70 people, a children's corner. a library and a room for religious instruction and a kitchenette are provided, based on budget and furnishings collected amount.&lt;ref name="hdr-bz"/&gt;

=== Buddhists ===
A member of the community told in an interview of the pitfalls when setting up the Buddhist rooms, which take place at least in the common building. In the entrance area is tiny temple, besides a small information room and a room with kitchen, where a teacher may also temporarily reside. The main room is kept simple: oiled oak floors, yellow walls and a {{convert|1.2|m|ft|0}}-high scultpre of the [[Buddha]] from Thailand. So Buddhists of all currents should feel addressed. Aimed is a beautiful space, in which people in any way recognize and feel comfortable. The finances were decisive for the size of the room. Each square meter costs 110 Swiss Francs ia year, the monthly costs amount to approximately 2,000 Swiss Francs, which are paid with donations.&lt;ref name="hdr-srf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srf.ch/kultur/gesellschaft-religion/so-leben-die-buddhisten-im-haus-der-religionen|title=So leben die Buddhisten im Haus der Religionen|publisher=SRF|author=Nicole Mohler|language=German|date=2014-12-14|accessdate=2014-12-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118210439/http://www.srf.ch/kultur/gesellschaft-religion/so-leben-die-buddhisten-im-haus-der-religionen|archivedate=18 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christians ===
Interested Christians, church communities, are involved since 2009 in the Club "Kirche im Haus der Religionen".&lt;ref name="hdr-kath"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathbern.ch/?id=1402|title=Haus der Religionen|publisher=Fachstelle Kirche im Dialog, Bern|author=|language=German|date=|accessdate=2014-12-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220120800/http://www.kathbern.ch/?id=1402|archivedate=20 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hindus ===
The [[Hindu temple]] of the ''Saivanerikoodam'' association was not yet finished in December 2014, but the interior rooms are shaped after the 'typical' [[Dravidian architecture|South Indian temple architecture]]. For ten [[Hindu deities]] shrines are to be built, integrated into a temple of about {{convert|500|m2|sqyd|0}}. There are also rooms for seminars, yoga, meditation, and for cultural and language training for children and adolescents. Of central importance will be the vegetarian cuisine, which come into contact with either meat or animal products. For the entire interior decoration, the Hindu community expects costs of two million Swiss Francs.&lt;ref name="hdr-bz"/&gt;

'''Jaya and Vijaya''' are the two gatekeepers (''[[Dwarapalaka]]'') of the abode of [[Vishnu]], known as [[Vaikuntha]] (meaning ''place of eternal bliss'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Legends of Devi|page=16|publisher=Orient Blackswan|year=1998|author=Bhattacharji, Sukumari|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ashtanga Yoga The Intermediate Series: Mythology, Anatomy, and Practice|page=34|publisher=New World Library|author=Gregor Maehle|year=2012|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curse of the four Kumaras==
[[File:Dasavatara4.png|thumb|upright|[[Hiranyakashipu]] was killed by [[Narasimha]] while [[Prahlada]] is shown praying]] 
According to a story from [[Bhagavata Purana]], the [[Four Kumaras]], [[Sanaka]], [[Four Kumaras|Sanandana]], [[Sanatana]], and  [[Sanatkumara]] who are the [[manasputra]]s of [[Brahma]] (sons born from the mind or thought power of Brahma), visited [[Vaikuntha]], the abode of [[Vishnu]], to see him.

Due to the strength of their ''tapas'', the four Kumaras appear to be mere children, though they are of great age. Jaya and Vijaya, the gate keepers of the [[Vaikuntha]] interrupt the Kumaras at the gate, thinking them to be children. They also tell the Kumaras that Sri Vishnu is resting and that they cannot see him now.  The enraged Kumaras replied Jaya and Vijaya that Vishnu is available for his devotees any time, and cursed both the keepers Jaya and Vijaya, that they would have to give up their divinity, be born as mortals on Earth (''bhuloka'', or [[physical plane]]), and live like normal human beings. Vishnu appeared before them, and the gatekeepers requested Vishnu to lift the curse of the Kumaras. Vishnu said that the curse of the Kumaras cannot be reversed. Instead, he gives Jaya and Vijaya two options. The first option is to take seven births on Earth as a devotee of Vishnu, while the second is to take three births as his enemy. After serving either of these sentences, they can re-attain their stature at Vaikuntha and be with him permanently. Jaya and Vijaya cannot bear the thought of staying away from Vishnu for seven lives. As a result, they choose to be born three times on Earth even though it would have to be as enemies of [[Vishnu]]. (This story is also used as a metaphor about the cost of committing transgressions in "The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna".)

In the first life, they were born as [[Hiranyakashipu]] and [[Hiranyaksha]] in the [[Krita Yuga]], to [[Diti]] (daughter of Daksha Prajapathi) and sage [[Kashyapa]] who were killed by Vishnu [[Varaha avatar]] (a boar) and [[Narasimha | Narasimha avatar]] (a man-lion) in the [[Satya Yuga]].

In their second life, they were born as [[Ravana]] and [[Kumbhakarna]] and were killed by Vishnu's [[Rama | Rama avatar]] in the [[Treta Yuga]].

In their third life, they were born as [[Shishupala]] and [[Dantavakra]] who were killed by Vishnu's [[Krishna | Krishna avatar]] in the [[Dwapara Yuga]].

It has been noted by many that the strengths of Jaya and Vijaya gradually declined with each subsequent birth. Vishnu needed one avatar each to kill Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashipu. Born as Rama he was able to vanquish both Ravana and Kumbhakarna. In his Krishna avatar the killing of Shishupala and Dantavakra is not the main focus but more to reduce the 'Bhoobhara" (The burden on mother earth by too many sinners).

==Door-keepers of Vishnu temples==
[[File:Jagannath Temple, Puri 02.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Vijaya at the entrance of the [[Jagannath Temple, Puri]]]]
In the modern era, known in [[Sanskrit]] as the [[Kali Yuga]], Jaya and Vijaya are free from their curse, and they can be seen as gatekeepers in Vishnu temples and temples affiliated with [[Vaishnavism]]. Statues of Jaya-Vijaya stand in the temple of [[Venkateswara]] in [[Tirumala]], the temple of [[Jagannath]] in [[Puri, Orissa|Puri]], and the temple of [[Ranganatha]] in [[Srirangam]]. 

== Incarnations ==

As Hirakyakasipu and Hiranyaksha in Satya-yuga, as Ravana and Kumbhakarna in the Treta-yuga, and as Shishupala and Dantavakra at the end of Dvapara-yuga.

'''John Clement Whitcomb, Jr'''. (born June 22, 1924 in [[Washington, D.C.]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[theologian]] and [[young Earth creationist]]. He is well known as the co-author with [[Henry M. Morris]] of ''[[The Genesis Flood]]'', which influenced many conservative American Christians to adopt [[flood geology]].

==Biography==
Whitcomb was the son of an army officer. He lived in northern China between the ages of 3 and 6, and later attended [[The McCallie School]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]].&lt;ref name="WMBiosketch"&gt;[http://www.whitcombministries.org/about-us.html#johnbiosketch Dr. Whitcomb's Biosketch], WhitcombMinistries.org.  Accessed 2012-01-23.&lt;/ref&gt; His education at [[Princeton University]] was interrupted in 1943 when he was drafted into the [[United States Army]] and served in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="WMBiosketch" /&gt; While at Princeton, he converted to [[evangelical Christianity]] through the ministry of [[Donald B. Fullerton]] and the [[Princeton Christian Fellowship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sharp |first1=Doug |title=Persuaded by the Evidence |date=July 31, 2008 |publisher=Master Books |isbn=9780890515457 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l06akj0-4hQC&amp;pg=PT200}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied historical geology and paleontology for a year and graduated in 1948 with honors in ancient and European history. Thereafter he enrolled at [[Grace Theological Seminary]] in [[Winona Lake, Indiana]], where he earned a [[Bachelor of Divinity|B.D.]] degree in 1951, and remained at the seminary, teaching Old Testament and Hebrew, along with Young Earth Creationism.
In 1953, the [[American Scientific Affiliation]] (ASA) held its annual conference at Grace. Whitcomb was especially impressed by Dr. [[Henry M. Morris]]' presentation defending [[Flood geology]] against [[day-age creationism|day-age]], [[gap creationism|ruin-restoration]] and pictorial-day views. The two found that they shared a belief in a literal six-day creation and a global Flood. [[Bernard Ramm]]'s book ''The Christian View of Science and Scripture'', which was published in 1954 and led to ASA rejection of Flood geology, impelled Whitcomb to devote his doctoral dissertation to rebutting Ramm and defending a literal interpretation of Genesis 6-9. Whitcomb polled Old Testament, archeology and apologetics scholars at evangelical schools, but although he found a wide range of viewpoints, he found little support for Flood geology. Whitcomb completed his dissertation on 'The Genesis Flood' in 1957.&lt;ref name=Numbers212&gt;Numbers (2006) p. 212-217&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitcomb set about preparing his dissertation for publication, and sought somebody with a PhD in science to check or write the chapters on the scientific aspects of the Flood, but found himself unable to find any "Ph.D.s in geology today who take Genesis 6-9 seriously." His work was viewed with disfavour even by Douglas A. Block, reputedly the only scientist at [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] who held to the idea of a global Flood, who stated:

{{quote|It would seem that somewhere along the line there would have been a genuinely well-trained geologist who would have seen  the implications of flood-geology and, if tenable, would have worked them into a reasonable system that was positive rather than negative in character.}}

Whitcomb accepted this criticism, being already aware that his inability to deal effectively with objections raised to Flood geology by ASA scientists was his "greatest weakness". He agreed to put off publication of the book to allow Morris to co-author chapters on scientific issues (including [[radioactivity]], [[stratification (archeology)|stratification]] and [[uniformitarianism]]).&lt;ref name=Numbers212 /&gt;

''The Genesis Flood'', published by Whitcomb and Morris in 1961, "became a best-seller in the [[Fundamentalist Christianity|Fundamentalist]] world and polarized Evangelical opinion", though it was ignored by university scientists and liberal Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur McCalla, ''The Creationist Debate: The Encounter Between the Bible and the Historical Mind'' (London: Continuum International, 2006), 172.&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by the launch of the [[Creation Research Society]] in 1963 and of Morris' [[Institute for Creation Research]] in 1972. [[Ken Ham]], the founder of [[Answers in Genesis]] and the [[Creation Museum]] near [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], credited ''The Genesis Flood'' for "really launch[ing] the modern creationist movement around the world." &lt;ref&gt;Henry Morris obituary, [http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?ID=22739 Baptist Press News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206004636/http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?ID=22739 |date=February 6, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitcomb taught at Grace Theological Seminary's Old Testament and Christian Theology departments from 1951 to 1990.  He was dismissed amid several theological controversies. Whitcomb attributes his dismissal to Dave Plaster prohibiting him attending a meeting of Conservative Grace Brethren Association (of which Whitcomb was a member) in [[Orrville, Ohio]], in January 1990. Whitcomb went, and upon his return was fired. He had shared concerns about theological drifts within the Seminary, especially in regards to Genesis 1).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Personal interview with Dr. John C. Whitcomb in Indianapolis, IN on April 18, 2013 by Dr. Daniel J. Pritchett&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, he was part of a split from the [[Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches]], the denominational home both of himself and Grace Seminary, forming the [[Conservative Grace Brethren Churches, International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert G. |last=Clouse |title=Changes and Partings: Division in the Progressive/Grace Brethren Church |journal=Brethren Life and Thought |volume=42 |issue=3–4 |date=Summer–Fall 1997 |pages=187–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurred after the Conservative Grace Brethren Association (CGBA) had been denied a request to be a recognized as a Cooperating Agency with the FGBC at National Conference.  Whitcomb held no official title within the organization.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Whitcomb and his wife Norma reside in [[Indianapolis]].  He serves as President Emeritus of Whitcomb Ministries, Inc., and as a speaker for Answers in Genesis.&lt;ref name="AnswersBio"&gt;{{cite news |title=John C.

==Personal life==
In 2008, Radnor told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "I do [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]], and part of the reason I chose my house is that I thought it would be a great place to meditate."&lt;ref name=lat2008&gt;{{cite web |last=Sachs |first=Mark |title=Plenty of spots to meet |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/nov/28/entertainment/et-faveweekend28 |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radnor is an outspoken opponent of [[pornography]]. In a 2016 interview, he said, "I'm not a porn addict, though I believe the addiction is real. I didn't grow up in any kind of repressive, super religious environment. I never felt I was in danger of eternal damnation or anything... I do believe porn is a huge problem that has to be confronted. The battle, though, is ultimately an internal one. Each person has to decide for themselves whether to have this thing in their lives or not. I value love and connection and friendship and community. I want to encourage more creativity, joy, and peace in my life. Porn is opposed to all of that. I stand strong with anyone choosing to get porn out of their lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fightthenewdrug.org/porn-kills-love-qa-actor-josh-radnor/ |title=Porn Kills Love Q&amp;A: Filmmaker/Actor Josh Radnor |publisher=Fightthenewdrug.org |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radnor is an avid [[Cloud Cult]] fan. He collaborated with the band to make the film ''The Seeker'' in 2016. Radnor explained, "What's true for me about a lot of music, but especially true for Cloud Cult's music, is that it stirs up the thing that's already in you and calls it out. If this film is able to do that, I'll sleep well at night."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/04/cloud-cult-made-a-gorgeous-one-hour-movie-with-jos.html |title=» Cloud Cult Made a Gorgeous One-Hour Movie with Josh Radnor |publisher=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |date=April 2016 |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siyyid-Kazim.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Kazim Rashti]]
'''Sayyid Kāz&amp;#803;im bin Qāsim al-Ḥusaynī ar-Rashtī''' (1793–1843) ({{lang-ar|سيد كاظم بن قاسم الحسيني الرﺷتي}}), mostly known as '''Siyyid Kázim Rashtí''' ({{lang-fa|سید کاظم رشتی}}), was the son of Sayyid Qasim of [[Rasht]], a town in northern [[Iran]]. He was appointed as the successor of [[Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsa'i]], and led the [[Shaykhism|Shaykhí]] movement until his death.

He came from a family of well known merchants. He was a [[Mullah]] who, after study of the [[List of Islamic texts|Islamic writings]] told his students about the coming of the [[Mahdi]] and the "[[Masih]]" (the return of Christ) and taught them how to recognize them.  After his death in 1843, many of his students spread out around [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] for the search.

Upon his death he was buried near the tomb of [[Imam Husayn]] in [[Karbala]].

==Successorship==
On the death of Sayyid Kazim on 31 December 1843, some Shaykhis went on to become Babis, some of whom later became Bahais, and the rest split into three factions. It is reported that before dying, instead of appointing a successor, he sent his [[wikt:disciple|disciples]] out to find the Promised One.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter| authorlink= Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= Kázim Rashti, Sayyid |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pYfrAQAAQBAJ |pages= 217-217}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most noted followers, [[Mullá Husayn]] said:
:"Our departed teacher insistently exhorted us to forsake our homes, to scatter far and wide, in quest of the promised Beloved... Regarding the features of the Promised One, he told us that He is of a pure lineage, is of illustrious descent, and of the seed of [[Fatimah]]. As to His age, He is more than twenty and less than thirty. He is endowed with innate knowledge. He is of medium height, abstains from smoking, and is free from bodily deficiency."
::(quoted in Nabil-i-A'zam's ''The Dawn-Breakers",or "Nabil's Narrative", translated by Shoghi Effendi,  p. 57)

In 1844 [[Mullá Husayn]], after meeting the Siyyid `Alí-Muhammad (the [[Báb]]) in Shiraz accepted him as the Mahdi.

===The Báb's relationship to Sayyid Káz&amp;#803;im===
The Shaykhis had previously met Siyyid `Alí-Muhammad in Karbila' when he attended the meetings of Sayyid Káz&amp;#803;im.  There is disagreement over the amount of time Sayyid Mírzá `Alí-Muhammad stayed in Karbila' and the frequency of his attending Sayyid Káz&amp;#803;im's lectures; [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] sources state that the [[Báb]] only occasionally attended the meetings, while sources more critical to the Bahá'í Faith state that he stayed in Karbila for a year or two and learned the Shaykhi teachings. In the Bab's own writings, however, he refers to the Shaykhi leader as his teacher. Some statements include:

*[[E.G. Browne]] wrote that the Báb was in Karbila for two months meeting Sayyid Kazim occasionally:
*:"He [the Báb] proceeded at some time antecedent to the year A.H. 1259 (in which year Seyyid Kázim died) to Kerbelá, where he resided for some time (two months, according to the [http://www.paintdrawer.co.uk/david/folders/Research/Bahai/Bab/Tarikh-i-Jadid%20(1880%20History%20of%20the%20Bab)%5B76%5D.htm Táríkh-i-Jadíd]), occasionally attending the lectures of Hájí Seyyid Kázim of Resht"
*::(E.G. Browne, Notes in the Traveller's Narrative) [http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/tn/tnappx.htm]
::"One day the circle of those who sat at the feet of Seyyid Kázim was augmented by a fresh arrival. The new comer, who took his seat modestly by the door in the lowest place, was none other than Mírzá 'Alí Muhammad, who, impelled by a pious desire to visit the Holy Shrines, had left his business at Bushire to come to Kerbelá. During the next few months the face of the young Shírází became familiar to all the disciples of Seyyid Kázim, and the teacher himself did not fail to notice and appreciate the earnest but modest demeanour of the youthful stranger."
:::([http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/articles/A-E/browne/brbabism.htm Babism] by [[Edward Granville Browne|E G Browne]] in Religious Systems of the World, pp. 335).
*Bahá'í sources state that the Báb went on pilgrimage to Iraq for 7 months, to the cities of [[Najaf]] and [[Karbila]]. But they deny that a close bond developed with Sayyid Kázim.
*:"According to [[Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl]] of Gulpaygan, He journeyed to the holy cities of 'Iraq in the spring of 1841, stayed in 'Iraq for nearly seven months and returned to His 'native province of [[Fars Province|Fars]]' in the autumn of that year.
*:...
*:"While in Karbila the Bab visited Sayyid Kazim-i-Rashti and attended his discourses. But these occasional visits did not and could not make Him a pupil or disciple of Sayyid Kazim. His adversaries have alleged that He sat at the feet of Sayyid Kazim for months on end to learn from him."
*::(H.M. Balyuzi, ''The Bab - The Herald of the Day of Days'', p.&amp;nbsp;41)
*Amanat presents arguments for and against the Bab being a student of Sayyid Kazim (p140-1). On the one hand Mulla Sadiq Muqaddas states that "...Mir Ali Muhammad Shirazi [the Bab]...is a student of Sayyid Kazim..." and that he (Muqaddas) was introduced to Sayyid Kazim by the Bab. On the other hand, another contemporary, Qatil Karbala'i, who later became a Babi, states that the Bab attended Sayyid Kazim's lectures only two or three times. Amanat argues that the Bab was not in Karbala long enough to fully grasp Sayyid Kazim's teachings; in fact, Muqaddas himself states that once in Karbala, he was asked to teach the Bab, and that he was also determined to convert the Bab to Shaykhism. Amanat asserts that the Bab's reference to Sayyid Kazim as "the revered scholar and my intimate teacher" is a symbolic acknowledgement of their spiritual affinity and not a literal fact.
*[[`Abdu'l-Bahá|`Abdu'l-Bahá's]] wife, [[Munirih Khanum]] quotes in her biography her uncle stating:
*:"We had often heard in the course of his lectures Haji Sayyid Kazem stating the fact, that the day of the Manifestation was drawing nigh.  He admonished us at all times that we must be searching, and be in a state of quest, because the Promised One was living amongst the people, was associating with them; but unfortunately the people were veiled and lived in a state of negligence.
*:When we saw the Bab standing with such humility before the Shrine of Imam Hossein, we often wondered if perhaps, he was not the invisible Promised One, who had come to visit the Shrine of his ancestors.
*:...
*:During his seclusion in Karbala, he attended now and then the classes of Haji Sayyid Kasem, with a shining and luminous countenance.  Whenever he entered the class, Haji Sayyid Kasem would show him the greatest respect and honor."
*::(Munirih Khanum quoting her uncle, found in [http://www.paintdrawer.co.uk/david/folders/Research/Bahai/Misc/Episodes%20in%20the%20Life%20of%20Munirih%20Khanum%5B72%5D.htm ''Episodes in the Life of Moneereh Khanum''], pp.&amp;nbsp;11–12)
*In one of the Báb's earliest writings, the [http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/trans/vol2/suluk/suluktr.htm ''Risala fi'l-Suluk''], or "Treatise on Spiritual Wayfaring," he mentions the Shaykhi leader by name and refers to him as "my master, my support, my teacher, the pilgrim Sayyid Kazim al-Rashti."

'''Lakas–CMD''' ('''Lakas–Christian Muslim Democrats''') is a [[centre-right politics|center-right]] political party in the [[Philippines]], with influence of [[Christian democracy]] and [[Islamic democracy]]. The current party originated in 2009 with the merger of the [[Lakas–CMD (original)|original Lakas–CMD]] party with the [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI); it was known as '''Lakas–Kampi–CMD''' until 2012. The party produced one president, [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], who was president when the two parties merged in 2009.

With Arroyo unable to run for a new term due to term limits, the party lost the [[Philippine presidential election, 2010|2010 presidential election]] with [[Gilberto Teodoro]] as its presidential nominee. The party retained its two [[Philippine Senate|senators]], both incumbents, in the [[Philippine Senate election, 2010|Senate election]] and became a part of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]]-led majority coalition; in the [[Philippine House of Representatives elections, 2010|House of Representatives election]], it won 47% of the seats contested in the district election, but most of its members were split into three groups, with many defecting to the Liberal Party, some formed the [[National Unity Party (Philippines)|National Unity Party]], and the remaining members were split into the majority and minority blocs, with its members heading the minority. On May 11, 2012, the party decided to revert to its original name and drop Arroyo's KAMPI from the coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/top-stories/22728-lakas-drops-gmas-kampi-from-coalition |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514081052/http://www.manilatimes.net/index.php/news/top-stories/22728-lakas-drops-gmas-kampi-from-coalition |archivedate=2012-05-14 |df= }} The Manila Times: Lakas drops GMA's Kampi from coalition&lt;/ref&gt; Lakas–CMD is currently one of the parties in opposition.

==Ideology==
Lakas–CMD has always focused on economic growth and development, stronger ties with the [[United States]], creation of jobs, and strong cooperation between the executive and legislative branches of government. It is known for its advocacy of a shift from the present [[presidential system]] to a parliamentary form of government through constitutional amendments and through establishing peace talks with [[Islam in the Philippines|Muslim]] separatists and [[communism|communist]] rebels. The party democracy is distinct in its ecumenical inclusion of Muslim leaders in its political alliance.&lt;ref name= "Centre-right" &gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCrTDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA195&amp;|title=Southeast Asia In The New International Era|newspaper=|date=2016|author1=|author2=|accessdate=April 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Lakas–CMD (1991)|Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino}}

===Ramos administration===
[[Image:Ramos Pentagon.jpg|thumb|left|150px|President Fidel V. Ramos, co-founder of Lakas NUCD.]]
Lakas ng Tao was formed in December 1991 for the [[Philippine general election, 1992|1992 elections]] as retired General, then-Defense Secretary, [[Fidel V. Ramos]] and former [[Cebu]] Governor [[Emilio Mario Osmeña|Emilio Mario "Lito" R. Osmeña]] were running for president and vice-president respectively. It was also formed when Ramos bolted from the [[Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino]] (LDP; Struggle of Democratic Filipinos), after he had lost in the bid for the presidency under that said banner to Speaker [[Ramon Mitra]].

The party was formed out of two parties: Ramos's '''Partido Lakas ng Tao''' (People Power Party) and the '''National Union of Christian Democrats''' (NUCD) of [[Raul Manglapus]].  As they coalesced, the party became known as Lakas ng Tao-National Union of Christian Democrats, with Lakas ng Tao usually just shortened to "Lakas" and abbreviated as Lakas-NUCD.

In 1994, it formed a coalition government with the LDP for the [[Philippine general election, 1995|1995 legislative elections]].  This coalition, dubbed the "[[Lakas-Laban Coalition]]", won a majority in both Houses of Congress. In the 1997 Lakas National Convention, the party nominated House Speaker [[Jose de Venecia, Jr.]] of [[Pangasinan]] after a close nominal fight with then Defense Secretary [[Renato de Villa]] as its nominee to the presidency against the opposition's Vice President [[Joseph Estrada]] in the [[Philippine general election, 1998|1998 elections]].  By this time, it was joined by the '''Union of Muslim Democrats of the Philippines''' (UMDP) of former ambassasor to Egypt and Oman [[Sanchez Ali|Sanchez A. Ali]] to form Lakas ng EDSA-National Union of Christian Democrats-United Muslim Democrats of the Philippines (Lakas-NUCD-UMDP).

Secretary de Villa eventually bolted the party and formed [[Partido ng Demokratikong Reporma]] (Democratic Reform Party) for the [[Philippine general election, 1998|1998 elections]].  Lakas also nominated then-Senator [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] of [[Pampanga]] as its candidate as [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]]. Arroyo had originally intended to run for president under her party, [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino|Kabalikat ng Mamamayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI). De Venecia lost to Vice President Estrada by a significant plurality, while Arroyo won the vice presidency in the same manner while her KAMPI party was in hiatus.

===Arroyo administration===
In the [[Philippine general election, 2004|2004 elections]], the name changed again to the current Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats, or Lakas–CMD.  However, the meaning of Lakas in the party name is usually now referred to as "Lakas ng [[EDSA I|EDSA]]" which means "The Strength of EDSA" than the original Lakas ng Tao which means "The Strength of the People" or "People Power."  This is also the name that it used when it ran in 2004 elections under the K-4 coalition.  President Arroyo, who succeeded the deposed President [[Joseph Estrada]], was the K-4 Coalition candidate for president in the 2004 election, eventually winning over her opponents primarily [[Fernando Poe, Jr.]] and Senator [[Panfilo Lacson]].&lt;ref name= "Centre-right" /&gt;

At the onset of 2006, Lakas–CMD was torn by factional rivalry between supporters of President Arroyo and supporters of former President [[Fidel V. Ramos]].  Issues include transitory provisions in a proposed Constitution to scrap mid-term elections (or "no-el") set for 2007 and calls for her to step down in time for the elections, which is related to the "no-el" controversy. The party held its Annual Party Directorate Meeting on January 14, 2006 to discuss these matters.

There are no official results available of the 2007 [[elections in the Philippines|elections]] released by the party but according to the [[Philippine House of Representatives]], the party holds 79 out of 235 seats.

On January 16, 2008, Lakas spokesman and legal counsel [[Raul Lambino]] stated that Lakas–CMD officially released the list of senatorial bets for 2010—spokesman  in 2010. Except for Parañaque Representative Eduardo Zialcita, they were not yet identified. But Lambino named incumbent Senators [[Ramon Revilla, Jr.]] and [[Lito Lapid]], former senator [[Ralph Recto]] and former Congressman [[Prospero Pichay]] as among those considered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080116-112714/Lakas-lists-down-30-senatorial-bets-for-2010--spokesman  Inquirer.net, Lakas lists down 30 senatorial bets for 2010--spokesman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910230132/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080116-112714/Lakas-lists-down-30-senatorial-bets-for-2010--spokesman |date=2012-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Speaker of the House [[Jose de Venecia, Jr.]] (Pangasinan -4th District) resigned his post as president of Lakas–CMD on March 10, 2008; he rejected the proposition of former president [[Fidel Ramos]] to give him the title Chairman-emeritus. The current Speaker of the House [[Prospero Nograles]] (Davao -1st District) was sworn it as the new president of Lakas–CMD party and former Speaker of the house [[Feliciano Belmonte, Jr.]] as vice president for Metro Manila affairs on the same day.

[[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] on June 18, 2008, confirmed the historical [[merger]] of the [[Lakas-CMD (1991)|Lakas-Christian Muslim Democrats]] (Lakas–CMD) and the [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI) parties. Both parties adopted the "equity of the incumbent" principle, as the merger would account for almost 200 national and 8,000 local officials, amid Mrs. Arroyo's prediction of  2010 elections victory. [[Prospero Nograles]], Lakas President and Kampi Chair [[Ronaldo Puno]] signed the covenant at the [[Davao City]] regional [[caucus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=news4_june19_2008|title=Manila Standard Today - Latest News in the Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/101994/Lakas-CMD-Kampi-merge|title=Lakas-CMD, Kampi merge|work=GMA News Online|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former President and Lakas–CMD Chairman Emeritus [[Fidel V. Ramos]] announced on February 6, 2008 that Lakas–CMD would be the surviving entity after its merger with [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino|KAMPI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080206-117116/Ramos-De-Venecia-to-remain-president-in-Lakas-Kampi-merger|title=Ramos: De Venecia to remain president in Lakas-Kampi merger - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223035729/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20080206-117116/Ramos-De-Venecia-to-remain-president-in-Lakas-Kampi-merger|archivedate=23 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 9, 2009, Former House Speaker [[Jose de Venecia, Jr.]] and Former President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] led fifty members from the Lakas Kampi CMD in objecting to its merger with [[Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino]] (KAMPI) on May 28, 2009. The faction made de Venecia its President with Ramos as the Chairman Emeritus of the new party, Ramos refused the offer of Chairman Emeritus of Lakas-Kampi after being named in interim party organization. De Venecia has filed a resolution at the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] to declare ''null and void'' the merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090909-224323/Lakas-Kampi-CMD-merger-in-peril|title=Lakas-Kampi-CMD merger in peril - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427162726/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20090909-224323/Lakas-Kampi-CMD-merger-in-peril|archivedate=27 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] ultimately upheld the legality of the merger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/insideNation.htm?f=2010/january/1/nation3.isx&amp;d=/2010/january/1|title=Manila Standard Today - Latest News in the Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing the failure of de Venecia "to sufficiently show that any grave abuse of discretion was committed by the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] in rendering the challenged resolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=537212&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=63|title=Taxi hinoldap|work=philstar.com|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquino III administration===
Since [[Benigno Aquino III]] was sworn in as President of the Philippines on June 30, 2010, the majority of the former legislative member of Lakas-Kampi were sworn as a members of the reborn [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]]. In 2011, the legislators led by [[Pablo P. Garcia]] established the neutral [[National Unity Party (Philippines)|National Unity Party]], which has many similarities with the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]]. In 2013, the party suffered its largest decline, due  to the arrest of the party's [[matriarchy|matriarch]], Gloria Arroyo; however the remaining party largely supports the [[United Nationalist Alliance]], with candidates from among its former members such as [[Migz Zubiri]], [[Richard Gordon (politician)|Richard Gordon]] and [[Mitos Magsaysay]].

===Duterte administration and dissolution===
{{main|Coalition for Change (Philippines)}}
In the [[Philippine presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Elections]], Lakas supports the candidacy of [[Rodrigo Roa Duterte|Rodrigo "Rody/Digong" Duterte]] and [[Ferdinand Marcos, Jr.|Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos, Jr.]] for President and Vice President respectively, which Duterte won and Marcos lost to Liberal Party candidate [[Leni Robredo|Ma. Leonora "Leni" Robredo]]. In July 2017, Revilla was sworn into Duterte's party [[PDP-Laban]], and in October, Macapagal Arroyo and her allies, also joins PDP-Laban, as a result Lakas has been dissolved.

===Proposed Comeback===
{{main|Coalition for Change (Philippines)}}
In September 2018 House Minority Leader and Quezon Rep.

{{Refimprove|date=July 2009}}
[[Image:Chandra graha.JPG|200px|right|thumb|The Hindu [[Chandra]], riding his celestial chariot]]
In [[mythology]], a '''lunar deity''' is a [[god (male deity)|god]] or [[goddess]] associated with, or symbolic of the [[moon]]. These deities can have a variety of functions and traditions depending upon the culture, but they are often related. Some form of moon worship can be found in most ancient religions.

==Moon in religion and mythology==
The monthly cycle of the moon, in contrast to the annual cycle of the sun's path, has been implicitly linked to women's [[menstrual cycle]]s by many cultures, as evident in the links between the words for menstruation and for moon in many [[Language family|resultant]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Esther M., 'Woman's Mysteries: Ancient and Modern', London: Rider, 1971, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the most well-known mythologies feature female lunar deities, such as the Greek goddesses [[Phoebe (mythology)|Phoebe]], [[Artemis]], [[Selene]], and [[Hecate]] as well as the Chinese goddess [[Chang'e]].

Male [[lunar god]]s are also frequent, such as [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]] of the [[Mesopotamia]]ns, [[Mani (god)|Mani]] of the [[Germanic tribes]], and the Japanese god [[Tsukuyomi]]. These cultures usually featured female [[Solar deity|Sun goddesses]]. There are also many lunar deities that were prevalent in Greek and Egyptian civilizations. For example, Ibis and Chonsu of Thebes were both lunar deities. Thoth was also a lunar deity, but his character is considerably more complex than Ibis and Chonsu.&lt;ref name="Thoth, the Hermes of Egypt: a study of some aspects of theological thought in ancient Egypt, page 75"&gt;''Thoth, the Hermes of Egypt: a study of some aspects of theological thought in ancient Egypt, page 75''&lt;/ref&gt; Set represented the Moon in the Egyptian Calendar of Lucky and Unlucky Days of papyrus Cairo 86637.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jetsu, L.|author2=Porceddu, S.|title=Shifting Milestones of Natural Sciences: The Ancient Egyptian Discovery of Algol's Period Confirmed|journal = PLOS ONE|volume = 10 |issue = 12|date = 2015|pages = e.0144140 (23pp)|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0144140|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0144140|arxiv=1601.06990|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1044140J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European]] lunar deity appears to have been a male god.&lt;ref&gt;Dexter, Miriam Robbins. Proto-Indo-European Sun Maidens and Gods of the Moon. Mankind Quarterly 25:1 &amp; 2 (Fall/Winter, 1984), pp. 137–144.&lt;/ref&gt; Several goddesses, like [[Artemis]] or [[Hecate]], did not originally have lunar aspects, and only acquired them late in antiquity, due to syncretism with [[Selene]]/[[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], the de facto Greco-Latin lunar deity. In traditions with male gods, there is little evidence of such syncretism, though the Greco-Roman [[Hermes]] has been equated with male Egyptian lunar gods like [[Thoth]]. In Greece proper, remnants of male moon gods are also seen with [[Menelaus]].

Also of significance is that many religions and societies are oriented chronologically by the moon, as opposed to the sun. One common example is [[Hinduism]] in which the word [[Chandra]] means "moon" and has religious significance during many Hindu festivals (e.g. [[Karwa Chauth]], Sankasht Chaturthi, and during the eclipses).

The moon is also worshipped in [[witchcraft]], both in its modern form, and in medieval times (e.g. in the cult of [[Madonna Oriente]]). The moon features prominently in [[Moon in art and literature|art and literature]], and also has a purported influence in human affairs, a belief that consistently remains a feature of [[astrology]] and theology.

{{Uruk Epics}}
'''''Lugalbanda and the Anzu Bird''''' is a [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian]] mythological account. The story is sometimes called '''''The Return of Lugalbanda''''' or '''''Lugalbanda II''''' being the second of two stories about the hero [[Lugalbanda]]. The first story is known as ''[[Lugalbanda in the Mountain Cave]]'', or sometimes ''Lugalbanda in the Wilderness''. They are part of a four-story cycle that describes the conflicts between [[Enmerkar]], king of Unug ([[Uruk]]), and the king of [[Aratta]]. The texts are believed to be composed during the [[Third Dynasty of Ur|Ur III Period]] (21st century BCE), but almost all of the extant copies come from [[History of Mesopotamia|Isin-Larsa period]] (20th-18th centuries BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Vanstiphout, H. (2003). Epics of Sumerian Kings, Atlanta: SBL, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, a few fragmentary bilingual copies (Sumerian and Akkadian) from Nineveh suggest that the texts were still known during the first millennium.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'' p.135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
This story starts with Lugalbanda alone in the highlands of [[Lullubi]]. He finds the chick of the giant Anzu (or Anzud) bird, which is described as a lion-headed eagle, and decides to feed the chick. When the Anzu bird returns, it is first startled by the chick not responding to its call, but once it finds out what happened, it is very pleased with Lugalbanda and in appreciation grants him the ability to travel at super speeds. With his newly gained super power Lugalbanda catches up with his comrades who are laying siege to the city of Aratta. But his king Enmerkar is facing problems with the siege and after a year of setbacks without success, decides to seek the advice of the goddess [[Inana]] who is back in Uruk (in the story referred to as Unug or Kulaba), pleading for her to assist him once more, as she had assisted in building a wall against the encroaching [[Amorite|Martu]] in the 50th year of his reign.  Finally Lugalbanda volunteers for the trip. Lugalbanda is able to travel the incredible distance over seven mountain ranges within a day's time. Inanna responds with a parable instructing Enmerkar how to wrest control of Aratta and its resources.

[[Sweden]] is home to one of the largest communities of the [[Mandaeans|Mandaean]] [[ethnoreligious group]], numbering around 8,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stockholmsfria.se/artikel/118491 "Från Jordanfloden till fristaden i Vällingby."

''The New York Times.''] Retrieved 2018-07-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Several thousand of the Swedish Mandaeans were granted asylum status as refugees from persecution in Iraq and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/holy-post/gnostic-sunset-strife-in-syria-and-iraq-driving-out-mandaeans-the-last-surviving-followers-of-john-the-baptist/ |title=Gnostic sunset: Strife in Syria and Iraq driving out Mandaeans, the last surviving followers of John the Baptist |publisher=''[[National Post]]'' |accessdate=2014-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Mandaeans came to Sweden in the 1970's, including the al-Khafaji family who owned a [[goldsmith]]s business on [[Kungsgatan, Stockholm|Kungsgatan]] in Stockholm. The first Mandaean religious worship took place in 1997 when a ''tarmida'' (Mandaean priest) from the [[Netherlands]] was visiting. Following the [[Iraq War]] there was a increased influx of refugees, and as of 2017 there were a total of eight ''tarmidas'' living in Sweden under the leadership of Salwan Alkhamas, who holds the position of ''genzibra'' or bishop. The first Mandaean place of worship, or ''mandi'', was consecrated in [[Sandviken]] in 2003. Most Mandaeans in Sweden live in [[Scania]] in the south of the country, and in the [[Stockholm]] region, with a growing population of about 1,500 people in [[Södertälje]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1137147/FULLTEXT02.pdf "Religiösa minoriteter från Mellanöstern" pp114-134.

Chhatar Jatra is one of the most popoular festival of Manikeswari at Bhawanipatna.&lt;ref&gt;http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2009/September/engpdf/90.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Khandasadhaka is a festival associated with Manikeswari in Paralakhemundi.&lt;ref&gt;http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Journal/journalvol3/pdf/15-27.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief History of Manikeswari==
The deity of Chakrakotamandala comprising present days Kalahandi, Koraput and Bastar was Manikya debi or Manikeswari around 10th century A.D. Later on Kalahandi king Harichandra Deo struggled and died because of which his pregnant queen left for her father’s house in Gadapur, Phulbani. Some part of Phulbani was part of Mahakantara in ancient time and Chakrakota Mandala. Though capital of Chakrakotamandala is still being debated, it is clear that it has many similar with Kamala Mandala, another ancient name of Kalahandi, Manikya Devi came to Gadapur perhaps due to influence of Chakrakota Mandala. Later on, queen along with her son, Ramchandra Deo returned with  Manikya Debi or Manikeswari as per Kalahandi’s public request that time. Manikeswari was brought from Gadapur (Phulbani) around 1200 A.D and it was located in Kalahandi. Manikeswari was also popularized by Suryabansi Gajapati in 15th -16th century in Puri region. Purushottam Dev Gajapati considered Manikeswari as consort of Lord Jagannath and made a shrine of Manikeswari at Chilika, now doesn’t exist. Manikeswari is royal family deity of Parlakhemundi. Manikeswari was installed in Bhawanipatna much later around 1849 AD during shifting of the capital from Junagarh. Some people also mention Manikeswari in Thumaul Rampur as Adipitha and Devi was brought to Bhawanipatna from there. Uditnarayan Deo laid the foundation of the present modern temple in Bhawanipatna and it was completed in 1947 by Brajamohan Deo. Manikeswari was associated with Kalahandi history as a goddess of wealth, Manik, since 10th century. There is some debate to relate Manikeswari with Stambeswari temple in Asurgarh-Narla around 5-6th century as well as Maningeeswari in Banapur in Puri. There are many Manikeswari worshiping locations in many place of Orissa and Chhattisgarh, especially in undivided districts of Koraput, Phulbani-Boudh, Bolangir-Sonepur, Ganjam-Gajapati, Angul-Dhenkanal, Keonjhar, Sundergarh, etc. due to influence by various rulers. Though Manikeswari has lots of historical significance in Orissa and Chhattisgarh, it is not yet fully come to lime light.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4605">[[File:Artistic mystagogue.jpeg|thumb|Artistic rendition of a classical "mystagogue"]]
A '''mystagogue''' (from {{lang-el|μυσταγωγός}}, mystagogos, "person who initiates into mysteries") is a person who initiates others into [[mysticism|mystic]] beliefs, and an educator or person who has knowledge of the [[sacred mysteries]] of a belief system. Another word for mystagogue is [[hierophant]].

In ancient [[mystery religion]]s, a mystagogue would be responsible for leading an initiate into the secret teachings and rituals of a [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]]. The initiate would often be blindfolded, and the mystagogue would literally "guide" him into the sacred space.

In the [[early church|early Christian church]], this same concept was used to describe role of the [[bishop]], who was responsible for seeing to it that the [[catechumens]] were properly prepared for [[baptism]]. Mystagogical homilies, or [[homily|homilies]] that dealt with the Church's [[sacraments]], were given to those in the last stages of preparation for full Church membership. Sometimes these mystagogical instructions were not given until after the catechumen had been baptized. The most famous of these mystagogical works are the "Mystagogical Homilies" of St. [[Cyril of Jerusalem]], and the work, "On the Mysteries" by St. [[Ambrose of Milan]].

In various organizations, it is the role of the mystagogue to "mystify" pledges. The term is sometimes used to refer to a person who guides people through religious sites, such as churches, and explains the various artifacts. This branch of theology is at times called mystagogy. 

In the [[United States]] versions of mystagogical legends predate [[European colonization of the Americas|European contact]].  Early [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes around the [[Great Lakes region]], taught that the mystagogue was a spiritual leader, and upon death would transform into a beast with many heads.  The mystagogue would reappear in his beastly form and feed on those who strayed from the tribe if it was not in keeping with their religious customs.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last  =Simmel |first=Georg | date=January 1906 | title=The Sociology of Secrecy and Secret Societies |url= |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume =11 |issue=4 |pages=441–498 |doi=  |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical tradition of the mystagogue has carried on today in one way through the [[fraternity]] system in American [[university|universities]], that have historically held a position for a mystagogue at either the chapter or the national level.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book |last= Eliade |first= Mircea |date= 1993 |title=Rites and Symbols of Initiation: The Mysteries of Birth and Rebirth |url=  |location= Putnam, CT |publisher= Spring Publications |page= 204 |isbn= 9780882143583}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mystagogue is a person of great respect, and his knowledge concerning both the physical and spiritual matters of the organization is not questioned. In a way similar to that of some Native American traditions, the mystagogue in the fraternity system has the power to shut down parts of the fraternity which are not in keeping with [[Custom (law)|customs]] or [[tradition]].

[[Max Weber]], considered to be one of the founders of the modern study of [[sociology]], described the mystagogue as part magician and part prophet, and as one who dispensed "magical actions that contain the boons of salvation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kirkpatrick |first=R. George |last2=Tumminia |first2=Diana |editor-last=Swatos, Jr. |editor-first=William H. |title=Twentieth-Century World Religious Movements in Neo-Weberian Perspective |location= Lewiston, NY |publisher=Edward Mellyn |date=1992 |pages=299–311 |chapter=California Space Goddess: The Mystagogue in a Flying Saucer Cult}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Roy Wallis, "The primary criterion that Weber had in mind in distinguishing the ''prophet'' from the ''mystagogue'' was that the latter offers a largely magical means of salvation rather than proclaiming a radical religious ethic or an example to be followed."

'''Pu-Men High School (Fo Guang Shan Pu-Men High School)''' ([[Traditional Chinese]]: 普門中學 or 佛光山私立普門中學) is a private [[Buddhist]] [[high school]] located in [[Dashu District]], [[Kaohsiung]], [[Taiwan]]. The school is affiliated with the [[Fo Guang Shan]] Buddhist order founded by Venerable Master [[Hsing Yun]].

In 1977, the name was changed to '''Fo Guang Shan Private Pumen Senior High School''', and the  school was given to [[Fo Guang Shan]]. The school converted officially to '''Kaohsiung County Private-Operated Pu-Men Senior High School''' on August 1977.

==Founding principles ==
* Pu-Men, the Universal Door, is open to save all beings and to disseminate the spirit of the Guan Yin, the Bodhisattva of Compassion.
* Pu-Men believe in the importance of a Confucian education.
* Pu-Men is founded on Buddhism’s spirit of saving the world with an ideal education, great mercy, equality for all and unselfishness.
* Pu-Men strives to cultivate talents and virtues in youths by emphasizing intellectualism, morality, physical  well being and an appreciation of the aesthetics, to benefit all societies and all nations.
&lt;!--SORRY BUT NONE OF THIS NEXT SECTION MAKES SENSE. IT NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN
==Attending SD without BCT==
Attending the Senior Department without doing the Basic Competence Test (BCT) is only for the students of Pu-Men's own junior high students, unlike the general way of going to senior high school in Taiwan, students can have a unique and special way to use if he/she really wants to study the senior high and enjoy the life here. Most importantly, the final decision belongs to the student, forcing and compelling are not allowed.--&gt;

'''Marguerite Radclyffe Hall''' (12 August 1880 – 7 October 1943) was an English poet and author. She is best known for the novel ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'', a groundbreaking work in [[List of lesbian literature|lesbian literature]].

==Life==
[[File:II Sunny Lawn, Bournemouth, Dorset, UK (2).jpg|thumb|left|Sunny Lawn, [[Bournemouth]], [[Dorset]]]]

Marguerite Radclyffe Hall was born in 1880 at "Sunny Lawn", Durley Road, [[Bournemouth]], [[Hampshire]] (now [[Dorset]]),&lt;ref&gt;Baker p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; to a wealthy philandering father, Radclyffe Radclyffe-Hall, and an unstable mother, Mary Jane Diehl.&lt;ref&gt;Vargo, Marc E. [https://books.google.com/books?id=5kgVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT56 "Scandal: Infamous Gay Controversies of the Twentieth Century"] pp. 56-57&lt;/ref&gt; Her stepfather was the professor of singing [[Albert Visetti]], whom she did not like and who had a tempestuous relationship with her mother.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jY0GDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158 Laura Seddon, ''British Women Composers and Instrumental Chamber Music in the Early Twentieth Century'', Routledge (2013) - [[Google Books]] p158]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/radclyffe-hall Radclyffe Hall Biography - Your Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Hall was a lesbian&lt;ref name= "glbtq"&gt;{{Cite news|title= Hall, Radclyffe |year=2002 |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/hall_radclyffe.html|last=Glagow |first= Joanne |periodical= GLBTQ |accessdate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and described herself as a "[[Sexual inversion (sexology)|congenital invert]]", a term taken from the writings of [[Havelock Ellis]] and other turn-of-the-century [[sexologists]]. Having reached adulthood without a vocation, she spent much of her twenties pursuing women she eventually lost to marriage.

[[File:John Singer Sargent - Mabel Batten.jpg|thumb|Mabel Batten sang to [[John Singer Sargent]] as he painted her portrait, around 1897]]

In 1907 at the [[Bad Homburg]] spa in Germany, Hall met Mabel Batten, a well-known amateur singer of [[lieder]]. Batten (nicknamed "Ladye") was 51 to Hall's 27, and was married with an adult daughter and grandchildren. They fell in love, and after Batten's husband died they set up residence together. Batten gave Hall the nickname John, which she used the rest of her life.&lt;ref name="Cline-58"&gt;Cline, pp 58–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915 Hall fell in love with Mabel Batten's cousin [[Una Vincenzo, Lady Troubridge|Una Troubridge]] (1887–1963), a sculptor who was the wife of Vice-Admiral [[Ernest Troubridge]], and the mother of a young daughter.  When Batten died in 1916, Hall had Batten's corpse embalmed and a silver crucifix blessed by the pope laid on it.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Philpot, "In and out of church," THE TABLET, 21 July, 2018, 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall, Batten and Troubridge were "undeterred by the Church's admonitions on same-sex relationships. Hall's Catholicism sat beside a life-long attachment to spiritualism and reincarnation."&lt;ref&gt;Ibid., 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, Radclyffe Hall and Una Troubridge began living together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apurnell.com/wilreadings/Hall.htm|title=Radclyffe Hall|work=A purnell|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509162044/http://www.apurnell.com/wilreadings/Hall.htm|archivedate=9 May 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1924 to 1929 they lived at 37 [[Holland Street, London|Holland Street]], Kensington, London.&lt;ref&gt;[File:Radclyffe Hall 37 Holland Street blue plaque.jpg "English Heritage Blue Plaque"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship would last until Hall's death. In 1934 Hall fell in love with Russian émigrée Evguenia Souline and embarked upon a long-term affair with her, which Troubridge painfully tolerated.&lt;ref&gt;Hall's letters to Souline were published in {{cite book |editor-last= Glasgow | editor-first= Joanne |year= 1997 |title=Your John: The Love Letters of Radclyffe Hall |location= New York|publisher= New York University Press |isbn=0-8147-3125-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall became involved in affairs with other women throughout the years.&lt;ref name="gianoulis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/waters_e.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321072254/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/waters_e.html |archivedate=21 March 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philpot, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later years and death ==
[[File:Author Radclyffe Hall, left, and Lady Una Troubridge with their dachshunds at Crufts dog show, February 1923.jpg|thumb|left|Radclyffe Hall, right, and Una, Lady Troubridge with their [[dachshund]]s at Crufts dog show, February 1923]]

Hall lived with Troubridge in London and, during the 1930s, in the tiny town of [[Rye, East Sussex]], noted for its many writers, including her contemporary the novelist [[E. F. Benson]]. Hall died at age 63 of [[colon cancer]], and is interred at [[Highgate Cemetery]] in [[North London]] at the entrance of the chamber of the Batten family, where Mabel is buried as well.

In 1930, Hall received the Gold Medal of the Eichelbergher Humane Award. She was a member of the [[PEN club]], the Council of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] and a fellow of the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Biographical note in the ''[[Virago Press]]'' edition of ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Radclyffe Hall was listed at number sixteen in the top 500 lesbian and gay heroes in ''[[The Pink Paper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pink Paper'', 26 September 1997 edition, issue #500&lt;/ref&gt;

==Novels==
Hall's first novel was ''The Unlit Lamp'', the story of Joan Ogden, a young girl who dreams of setting up a flat in London with her friend Elizabeth (a so-called [[Boston marriage]]) and studying to become a doctor, but feels trapped by her manipulative mother's emotional dependence on her. Its length and grimness made it a difficult book to sell, so she deliberately chose a lighter theme for her next novel, a social comedy entitled ''The Forge''.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, pp 152–156.&lt;/ref&gt; While she had used her full name for her early poetry collections, she shortened it to M. Radclyffe Hall for ''The Forge''. The book was a modest success, making the bestseller list of ''[[John O'London's Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Unlit Lamp'', which followed it into print, was the first of her books to give the author's name simply as Radclyffe Hall.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p  168.&lt;/ref&gt;

There followed another comic novel, ''A Saturday Life'' (1925), and then ''[[Adam's Breed]]'' (1926), a novel about an Italian headwaiter who, becoming disgusted with his job and even with food itself, gives away his belongings and lives as a hermit in the forest. The book's mystical themes have been compared to [[Hermann Hesse]]'s ''[[Siddhartha (novel)|Siddhartha]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, 183–186.&lt;/ref&gt; It sold well, was critically acclaimed, and won both the [[Prix Femina]] and the [[James Tait Black Prize]], a feat previously achieved only by [[E. M. Forster]]'s ''[[A Passage to India]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, pp 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Well of Loneliness''===
{{Main|The Well of Loneliness}}
Hall's best-known work was ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'', the only one of her eight novels to have overt [[lesbian]] themes. Published in 1928, ''The Well of Loneliness'' deals with the life of Stephen Gordon, a masculine lesbian who, like Hall herself, identifies as an "invert".

Although ''The Well of Loneliness'' is not sexually explicit, it was nevertheless the subject of an [[obscenity]] [[trial (law)|trial]] in the UK, which resulted in all copies of the novel being ordered destroyed. The United States allowed its publication only after a long court battle. It is currently published in the UK by [[Virago Press|Virago]], and by [[Anchor Press]] in the United States. ''The Well of Loneliness'' was number seven on a list of the top 100 lesbian and gay novels compiled by [[The Publishing Triangle]] in   1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishingtriangle.org/100best.asp|title=The Publishing Triangle's list of the 100 best lesbian and gay novels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later novels===
An anonymous verse [[Parody|lampoon]] entitled ''The Sink of Solitude'' appeared during the controversy over ''The Well''. Although its primary targets were James Douglas, who had called for ''The Well''{{'}}s suppression, and the [[Home Secretary]] [[William Joynson-Hicks]], who had started legal proceedings, it also mocked Hall and her book. One of the illustrations, which depicted Hall nailed to a cross, so horrified her that she could barely speak of it for years afterward. Her sense of guilt at being depicted in a drawing that she saw as blasphemous led to her choice of a religious subject for her next novel, ''The Master of the House''.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, p. 257; Cline, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Hall's insistence, ''The Master of the House'' was published with no cover [[blurb]], which may have misled some purchasers into thinking it was another novel about "inversion". Advance sales were strong, and the book made No.&amp;nbsp;1 on ''The Observer''{{'}}s bestseller list, but it received poor reviews in several key [[periodicals]], and sales soon dropped off.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, pp. 275–276.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States reviewers treated the book more kindly, but shortly after the book's publication, all copies were seized—not by the police, but by creditors. Hall's American publisher had gone bankrupt. Houghton Mifflin took over the rights, but by the time the book could be republished, its sales momentum was lost.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, pp. 279–280.&lt;/ref&gt;

British composer and ''bon vivant'' [[Gerald Tyrwhitt-Wilson, 14th Baron Berners]], wrote a ''[[roman à clef]]'' girls' [[school story]] entitled ''[[The Girls of Radcliff Hall]]'', in which he depicts himself and his circle of friends, including [[Cecil Beaton]] and [[Oliver Messel]], as lesbian schoolgirls at a school named "Radcliff Hall". The novel was written under the [[pseudonym]] "Adela Quebec" and published and distributed privately; the indiscretions to which it alluded created an uproar among Berners's intimates and acquaintances, making the whole affair highly discussed in the 1930s.  Cecil Beaton attempted to have all the copies destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Florence Tamagne, "History Of Homosexuality In Europe, 1919–1939", Algora Publishing, 2004; {{ISBN|0-87586-356-6}}, p 124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryony Jones, ''The music of Lord Berners (1883–1950): the versatile peer'', Ashgate Publishing, 2003; {{ISBN|0-7546-0852-2}}, pp 9, 101, 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beverly Lyon Clark, ''Regendering the school story: sassy sissies and tattling tomboys'', Routledge, 2001; {{ISBN|0-415-92891-5}}, p 143&lt;/ref&gt; The novel subsequently disappeared from circulation, making it extremely rare. The story is, however, included in Berners' ''Collected Tales and Fantasies''.

'''Reconstructionist Judaism''' ({{Lang-he|יהדות רקונסטרוקציוניסטית|yahadút rekonstruktsyonistit}} or {{rtl-lang|he|יהדות מתחדשת}} {{transl|he|yahadút mitkhadéshet}}) is a modern [[Jewish religious movements|Jewish movement]]  that views Judaism as a progressively evolving [[civilization]] and is based on the conceptions developed by [[Mordecai Kaplan]] (1881–1983). The movement originated as a semi-organized stream within [[Conservative Judaism]] and developed from the late 1920s to 1940s, before it seceded in 1955&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Mordecai M.|authorlink=Mordecai Kaplan|title=Judaism as a Civilization: Toward a Reconstruction of American-Jewish Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mtGFZbJut0gC|accessdate=27 February 2017|year=2010|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=978-0-8276-1050-7|pages=i–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and established a [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College|rabbinical college]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="KareshHurvitz2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karesh|first1=Sara E|last2=Hurvitz|first2=Mitchell M.|title=Encyclopedia of Judaism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2cCZBDm8F8C&amp;pg=PA417|accessdate=27 February 2017|year=2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|location=New York City, NY|isbn=978-0-8160-6982-8|page=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is substantial theological diversity within the movement. ''[[Halakha]]'', the collective body of Jewish Law, is not considered binding, but is treated as a valuable cultural remnant that should be upheld unless there is reason for the contrary. The movement also emphasizes positive views toward [[modernity]], and has an approach to Jewish custom which aims toward communal decision-making through a process of education and distillation of values from traditional Jewish sources.&lt;ref name="FAQ-Jewrecon"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQs on Reconstructionist Approaches to Jewish Ideas and Practices|url=http://jewishrecon.org/resource/faqs-reconstructionist-approaches-jewish-ideas-and-practices|website=Jewish Reconstructionist Communities|publisher=Reconstructionist Rabbinical College|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|Denominations}}
Reconstructionism was developed by [[Rabbi]] [[Mordecai Kaplan]] (1881–1983) and his son-in-law, Rabbi [[Ira Eisenstein]] (1906–2001), over a period of time spanning from the late 1920s to the 1940s. After being ridiculed by Orthodox  rabbis  for his focus on issues in the community and the sociopolitical environment, Kaplan and a group of followers founded the [[Society for the Advancement of Judaism]] (SAJ) in 1922. Its goal was to give rabbis the opportunity to form new outlooks on Judaism in a more progressive manner. Kaplan was the leader of the SAJ until 1945, when Eisenstein took over. In 1935, Kaplan published his book, ''Judaism as a Civilization: Toward a Reconstruction of American Jewish Life''. It was this book that Kaplan claimed was the beginning of the Reconstructionist movement. ''Judaism as a Civilization'' suggested that historical Judaism be given a "revaluation… in terms of present-day thought."&lt;ref name= Profiles&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11090853 |title= Profiles in American Judaism: the Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, and Reconstructionist traditions in historical perspective |last= Lee |first=Raphael Marc | isbn= 0-06066801-6 |edition= 1st |location=[[San Francisco]], CA |pages= 180–11 |oclc= 11090853}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |180–81}} Reconstructionism was able to spread with several other forms of literature, most notably the ''New Haggadah'' (1941) which for the first time blended Kaplan's ideologies in Jewish ceremonial literature.

Although Kaplan did not want Reconstructionism to branch into another Jewish denomination, it was on the inevitable track of becoming one. At the Montreal conference in 1967, Reconstructionist leaders called for a rabbinical school in which rabbis could be ordained under the Reconstructionist ideology and lead Reconstructionist congregations. By the fall of 1968, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College was opened in Philadelphia. Along with the establishment of the college, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association formed, which gave rabbis a strong network in the religious leadership of Reconstructionism.&lt;ref name= Profiles /&gt;{{rp |192–93}} The founding of these institutions were great strides in its becoming the fourth movement in North American [[Judaism]] ([[Orthodox Judaism |Orthodox]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] being the other three).

Reconstructionist Judaism is the first major movement of Judaism to originate in North America; the second is the [[Humanistic Judaism]] movement founded in 1963 by Rabbi [[Sherwin Wine]].

==Theology==
[[Mordecai Kaplan|Kaplan]] believed that, in light of advances in [[philosophy]], [[science]] and [[history]], it would be impossible for modern Jews to continue to adhere to many of Judaism's traditional theological claims. In agreement with Orthodox theology (articulated by prominent medieval Jewish thinkers including [[Maimonides]]), Kaplan affirmed that God is not [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] in any way. As such, all anthropomorphic descriptions of God are used metaphorically. Kaplan's theology went beyond this to claim that God is not [[Personal god|personal]], in that God is not a conscious being nor can God in any way relate to or communicate with humanity. Furthermore, Kaplan's theology defines God as the sum of all natural processes that allow people to become self-fulfilled.

&lt;blockquote&gt;To believe in God means to accept life on the assumption that it harbors conditions in the outer world and drives in the human spirit which together impel man to transcend himself. To believe in God means to take for granted that it is man's destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society. In brief, God is the Power in the cosmos that gives human life the direction that enables the human being to reflect the image of God.&lt;ref&gt;Sonsino, Rifat. ''The Many Faces of God: A Reader of Modern Jewish Theologies''. 2004, page 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most "classical" Reconstructionist Jews (those agreeing with Kaplan) reject traditional forms of theism, though this is by no means universal. Many are [[Deism|deists]], and a small number accept [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] views of God or the concept of a personal God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/subdivisions/reconstructionist_1.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Judaism: Reconstructionist Judaism|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Kaplan's theology, as he explicitly stated, does not represent the only Reconstructionist understanding of theology and theology is not the cornerstone of the Reconstructionist movement. Much more central is the idea that Judaism is a [[civilization]], and that the Jewish people must take an active role in ensuring its future by participating in its ongoing evolution.

Consequently, a strain of Reconstructionism exists which is distinctly non-Kaplanian. In this view, Kaplan's assertions concerning belief and practice are largely rejected, while the tenets of an "evolving religious civilization" are supported. The basis for this approach is that Kaplan spoke for his generation; he also wrote that every generation would need to define itself and its civilization for itself. In the thinking of these Reconstructionists, what Kaplan said concerning belief and practice is not applicable today. This approach may include a belief in a personal God, acceptance of the concept of "[[chosen people|chosenness]]", a belief in some form of [[resurrection]] or continued existence of the dead, and the existence of an obligatory form of ''[[halakha]]''. In the latter, in particular, there has developed a broader concept of ''halakhah'' wherein concepts such as "[[Eco-Kashrut]]" are incorporated.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Jewish law and tradition==
Reconstructionist Judaism holds that contemporary Western secular morality has precedence over Jewish law and theology. It does not ask that its adherents hold to any particular beliefs, nor does it ask that [[halakha]] be accepted as normative. Unlike classical [[Reform Judaism]], Reconstructionism holds that a person's default position should be to incorporate Jewish laws and tradition into their lives, unless they have a specific reason to do otherwise. The most important distinction between Reconstructionist Judaism and traditional Judaism is that Reconstructionism concludes that all halakha should be categorized as "[[mores|folkways]]" and not as [[religious law]].

Reconstructionism promotes many traditional Jewish practices. Thus, the [[613 commandments|commandments]] have been replaced with "folkways", non-binding customs that can be democratically accepted or rejected by the congregations. Folkways that are promoted include keeping [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in the [[Jewish prayer|prayer service]], studying [[Torah]], daily prayer, wearing [[kippah|''kippot'']] (''yarmulkes''), ''[[tallit]]ot'' and ''[[tefillin]]'' during prayer, and observance of the [[Jewish holidays]].

==Beliefs==
In practice, Kaplan's books, especially ''The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion'' and ''[[Judaism as a Civilization]]'' are ''de facto'' statements of principles.  In 1986, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association (RRA) and the Federation of Reconstructionist Congregations and Havurot (FRCH) passed the official "Platform on Reconstructionism". It is not a mandatory statement of principles, but rather a consensus of current beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;See the FRCH Newsletter, Sept. 1986, pages D, E.&lt;/ref&gt; Major points of the platform state that:

{{quote|Judaism is the result of natural human development. There is no such thing as divine intervention; Judaism is an evolving religious civilization; [[Zionism]] and [[aliyah]] (immigration to Israel) are encouraged; Reconstructionist Judaism is based on a democratic community where the laity can make decisions, not just rabbis; The Torah was not inspired by God; it only comes from the social and historical development of Jewish people; The classical view of God is rejected. God is redefined as the sum of natural powers or processes that allows mankind to gain self-fulfillment and moral improvement; The idea that God chose the Jewish people for any purpose, in any way, is "morally untenable", because anyone who has such beliefs "implies the superiority of the elect community and the rejection of others."}}

Most Reconstructionists do not believe in [[revelation]] (the idea that God reveals his will to human beings). This is dismissed as [[supernatural]]ism. Kaplan posits that revelation "consists in disengaging from the traditional context those elements in it which answer permanent postulates of human nature, and in integrating them into our own ideology…the rest may be relegated to archaeology".&lt;ref&gt;''The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion''&lt;/ref&gt;

Many writers have criticized the movement's most widely held theology, [[religious naturalism]]. [[David Ray Griffin]] and [[Louis Jacobs]] have objected to the redefinitions of the terms "revelation" and "God" as being intellectually dishonest, and as being a form of "conversion by definition"; in their critique, these redefinitions take [[non-theistic]] beliefs and attach [[theistic]] terms to them. Similar critiques have been put forth by Rabbis [[Neil Gillman]],&lt;ref&gt;''Sacred Fragments'', p.&amp;nbsp;200&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milton Steinberg]],&lt;ref&gt;''Milton Steinberg: Portrait of a Rabbi'' by Simon Noveck, Ktav, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;259–260M&lt;/ref&gt; and Michael Samuels.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lord Is My Shepherd: The Theology of a Caring God'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Reconstructionist Judaism is [[egalitarian]] with respect to [[gender roles]]. All positions are open to all genders; they are open to lesbians, gay men, and transgender individuals as well.

==Jewish identity==
Reconstructionist Judaism allows its rabbis to determine their own policy regarding officiating at [[Interfaith marriage|intermarriages]]. Some congregations accept [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] as well as [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] descent, and children of one Jewish parent, of any gender, are considered Jewish by birth if raised as Jews. This contrasts with the traditional interpretations of Jewish law of both Rabbinical Judaism, in which a child is Jewish by birth if its mother was Jewish; and of Karaite Judaism, in which a child is Jewish by birth if its ''father'' was Jewish.

The role of non-Jews in Reconstructionist congregations is a matter of ongoing debate. Practices vary between synagogues. Most congregations strive to strike a balance between inclusivity and integrity of boundaries. The Jewish Reconstructionist Federation (JRF) has issued a non-binding statement attempting to delineate the process by which congregations set policy on these issues, and sets forth sample recommendations. These issues are ultimately decided by local lay leadership.&lt;ref&gt;''Can Halakha Live?'' by Rabbi [[Edward Feld]], ''The Reconstructionist'', Vol.59(2), Fall 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;64-72&lt;/ref&gt;  Mixed Jewish/Non-Jewish couples, however, are welcome in Reconstructionist congregations.

In 2015 the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] voted to accept rabbinical students in interfaith relationships, making Reconstructionist Judaism the first type of Judaism to officially allow rabbis in relationships with non-Jewish partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/75811/reconstructionists-give-green-light-to-intermarried-rabbinical-students|title=Reconstructionists give green light to intermarried rabbinical students|publisher=Jweekly|author=Lisa Hostein|date=October 1, 2015|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In making the decision, the movement considered that “many younger progressive Jews, including many rabbis and rabbinical students, now perceive restrictions placed on those who are intermarried as reinforcing a tribalism that feels personally alienating and morally troubling in the 21st century.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/news/329163/7-reconstructionist-rabbis-quit-as-synagogues-debate-intermarried-rabbis/?attribution=home-hero-item-text-1 7 Reconstructionist Rabbis Quit as Synagogues Debate Intermarried Rabbis] The Forward, 8 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016 nineteen Reconstructionist rabbis announced they will form an offshoot group in part to protest the decision to allow rabbis to have non-Jewish partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/2016/04/08/news-opinion/united-states/reconstructionist-offshoot-forms-over-intermarried-rabbis-bds Reconstructionist offshoot forms over intermarried rabbis, BDS] JTA, April 8, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
{{Progressive Judaism}}
Over 100 synagogues and ''[[havurot]]'', mostly in the United States and Canada, were affiliated with the [[Jewish Reconstructionist Federation]]. As of June 3, 2012 the Reconstructionist movement has been restructured. A joint institution consisting of the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] and the congregational organization is now the primary organization of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rrc.edu/node/1193, "Movement Restructuring FAQs", Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, June 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/25852/Do_the_Jewish_Streams_Have_a_Future/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514172921/http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/25852/Do_the_Jewish_Streams_Have_a_Future/ |archivedate=2012-05-14 |df= }}, "Do the Jewish Streams Have a Future?", The Jewish Exponent, May 09, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The movement's new designation was first "Jewish Reconstructionist Communities," and in 2018 became "Reconstructing Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.jta.org/2018/01/30/news-opinion/united-states/reconstructionist-rabbinical-school-changes-name-to-reconstructing-judaism |title= Reconstructionist Rabbinical School Changes Name to Reconstructing Judaism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.jewishrecon.org |title=Jewish Reconstructionist Community |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Deborah Waxman]] was inaugurated as the president of the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] and Jewish Reconstructionist Communities on October 26, 2014.&lt;ref name="jewishexponent.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://jewishexponent.com/community/2014/10/waxman-inaugurated-as-head-of-reconstructionist-rabbinical-college |title=Waxman Inaugurated as Head of Reconstructionist Rabbinical College |work=Jewish Exponent}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the president of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, she is believed to be the first woman and first lesbian to lead a Jewish congregational union, and the first lesbian to lead a Jewish seminary; the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College is both a congregational union and a seminary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/national-news/reconstructionists-pick-first-woman-lesbian-denominational-leader |title=Reconstructionists Pick First Woman, Lesbian As Denominational Leader  - The Jewish Week |work=The Jewish Week |accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title =RRC Announces New President Elect | location =Wyncote, PA (USA) | publisher = Reconstructionist Rabbinical College | date =2013-10-09 | url =http://www.rrc.edu/sites/default/files/ORPHAN_PDFs/RRC_WaxmanPresidentElect-ForPress3.pdf?hero=1615 | accessdate = 2013-10-16}}

The [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] educates rabbis. The [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association]] is the professional organization of Reconstructionist rabbis. The Jewish Reconstructionist youth organization is named [[No'ar Hadash]].

==Relation to other Jewish movements==
Originally an offshoot of [[Conservative Judaism]], Reconstructionism retains warm relations with Reform Judaism. [[Orthodox Judaism]], however, considers Reconstructionism to be in violation of proper observance of interpretation of Jewish law.&lt;ref name="Robinson2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=George|title=Essential Judaism: A Complete Guide to Beliefs, Customs and Rituals|year=2000|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York City, NY|isbn=0-671-03480-4|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jewish Reconstructionist Federation]] is a member of the [[World Union for Progressive Judaism]], in which it gained an observer status in 1990.

==Defining religion and religious elements==

[[Religion]] has several definitions. [[Organized religion|Religions]] that are [[Religious organization|organized]] can be seen as [[cultural system]]s, with corresponding [[religious behaviour|behavior]] and practice. They often have [[sacred text]]s and [[holy places]]. A [[religious experience]], however, does not necessarily have to be understood through an established religious framework.

Themes and questions about life and death, innocence and guilt and violence are [[Existentialism|existential]] in nature; while they are not immediately understood as "religious", they are about the [[meaning of life]].

==Use of religious elements==

[[Video game developer]]s use religious and spiritual themes to involve the player more deeply in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Testa |first=Alessandro |date= |title= Religion(s) in Videogames Historical and Anthropological Observations |url=http://heiup.uni-heidelberg.de/journals/index.php/religions/issue/view/1449/showToc |journal= Online - Heidelberg Journal of Religions on the Internet |publisher= |volume= 05 |issue= Religion in Digital Games. Multiperspective and Interdisciplinary Approaches|pages= 249–276|doi= 10.11588/rel.2014.0.12170 |access-date=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video game developer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], who used to play outside as a child, used his experiences and memories of exploring the forest and discovering a Buddhist temple in the design of his video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/20/master-of-play |title= Master of Play |last1= Paumgarten |first1=Nick |date=2010-12-20 |website= [[The New Yorker]] |publisher= |access-date= 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian developer [[BioWare]] (''[[Mass Effect]]'', ''[[Dragon Age]]'') has in its offices several encyclopedias on religion, as well as the [[Book of the Dead]].&lt;ref name="Bissell"&gt;{{cite book |last= Bissell |first= Tom|authorlink=Tom Bissell|date= 2010|title= [[Extra Lives: Why Video Games Matter]] |publisher= Pantheon Books|page=120 |isbn=978-0-307-37870-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative portrayal of religions has been criticized.&lt;ref name="Religion or lack thereof"/&gt;

Religious elements are used in two ways: explicit and implicit. They are seen side-by-side in video games and do not exclude each other.&lt;ref name="Understanding"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Terry Ray |last2= Clanton | first2 = Dan W. |date= 2012 |title= Understanding Religion and Popular Culture: Theories, Themes, Products and Practices|publisher= [[Routledge]]|page= 130 |isbn= 9780415781060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion in ''Mass Effect'', for instance, can be understood as an "[[unseen character]]".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Irizarry, J.A. &amp; Irizarry, I.T. The Lord is My Shepard: Confronting Religion in the Mass Effect Trilogy. In Heidbrink, S. en Knoll, T. (ed.) ''Religion in Digital Games. Multiperspective &amp; Interdisciplinary Approaches.'' Volume 05 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explicit narrative references===
An explicit reference to a religious or spiritual concept is one that is clear to what it is referring.&lt;ref name="Understanding"/&gt; These can be based upon real-world religions, but also on fictional ones. Stories, [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]] and names of characters from [[religious text]]s are used as reference points.

====Ancient religions====
{{see also|Ancient Egyptian deities in popular culture}}
Ancient religions and their deities are used in various ways. The religions portrayed are often no longer practiced, like [[ancient Greek religion]].&lt;ref name="Religion or lack thereof"/&gt; In the real-time strategy game ''[[Age of Mythology]]'' the player has to choose a "major god", which gives certain gameplay benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-05-09-age-of-mythology-extended-edition-review |title=Age of Mythology: Extended Edition review |date=9 May 2014 |work=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Prince of Persia (2008 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' the nameless Prince has to fight [[Angra Mainyu|Ahriman]], an evil deity from [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Crecente, B. |year=2008 |title=Prince of Persia Ditches Roots, Gets a Final Fantasy Make-Over, |accessdate=18 September 2015|url= http://kotaku.com/5011425/prince-of-persia-ditches-roots-gets-a-final-fantasy-make-over}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Events and places====
Real world historical religions and events are used as inspiration for video games. For instance, while ''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]'' (2007) is [[historical fiction|fictional]], it is set during the [[Third Crusade]] in the [[Holy Land]]; the player takes on the role of the [[Assassins|Assassin]] [[Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad]] and is involved in the conflict between Catholic Christians, Orthodox Christians, Sunni Muslims and Shi'ite Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=LeJacq, Y. |year=2014 |title=Assassin's Creed Can Actually Teach You A Thing Or Two |url= http://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-can-actually-teach-you-a-thing-or-two-1576446550 |accessdate=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these religions appear, they are portrayed in a "sanitized manner".&lt;ref name="Kotaku Good"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/5509058/religion-in-games-less-a-leap-of-faith-more-a-suspension-of-belief |title= Religion in Games: Less a Leap of Faith, More a Suspension of Belief |last= Good |first= Owen |date= 2010-04-04 |website= [[Kotaku]] |publisher= |access-date= 2016-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Organizations====
Religion is often institutionalized, having a certain organisational structure. Most games in the ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series involve a religion, or a cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/5883361/the-rules-of-religion-and-why-the-next-one-just-might-be-a-game |title=The Rules of Religion, and Why The Next One Just Might Be a Game |first=Patricia |last=Hernandez |work=[[Kotaku]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religious violence====
In the action role-playing game ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' (2011) a civil war is about to erupt between the Empire and the Stormcloaks.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Thames, R. C. Religion as a Resource in Digital Games. In Heidbrink, S. en Knoll, T. (ed.) ''Religion in Digital Games. Multiperspective &amp; Interdisciplinary Approaches.'' Volume 05 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The Stormcloaks wish to worship Talos, a human ascended to godhood. The Empire suffered a defeat against the powerful Aldmeri Dominion, an alliance of Elves who have made the worship of Talos illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/what-happened-between-oblivion-skyrim-a-brief-history/2/ |title=What happened between Oblivion and Skyrim? Here's a brief history |first=Matt |last=Boyd |work=[[GamesRadar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is up to the player to help in the conflict.

===Implicit narrative references===
[[Image:Triforce.svg|thumb|right|175px|The [[Triforce]] from [[The Legend of Zelda|''The Legend of Zelda'' series]]. Based upon the concept of [[Mon (badge)|''mon'']], it is a recognizable symbol for the series]]
The stories of [[action-adventure]] and [[Role-playing video games|role-playing]] games often involve world-saving quests. The player, as the protagonist, takes on the role of the hero.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane McGonigal|McGonigal, J]] (2011). ''Reality is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better''. Maven Publishing, Amsterdam. Page 13&lt;/ref&gt; The player character is often destined to save the world, which in itself is a [[prophecy]].&lt;ref name="Religion or lack thereof"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/video-game-religions-or-lack-thereof |title=Video Game Religions (or Lack Thereof) |first=Gil |last=Almogi |accessdate=2016-04-21 |date=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slater, A.

Immersion into the Field''. Volume 07 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' uses religious elements and motifs like the [[Triforce]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cuddy, L. (ed.) The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy (2008). Open Court, Chicago. Page 196&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video games as a religious medium==

Players and developers use games to express their existential and spiritual feelings. Video games as cultural objects can also provide religious and spiritual experiences, like ''[[Journey (2012 video game)|Journey]]'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/community/2013/01/22/can-we-finally-begin-to-consider-video-games-experiences/|title=It's time we consider video games as ‘experiences,’ not mere products|work=[[VentureBeat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developer [[Jenova Chen]] said that "I feel that ''Journey'' is a very spiritual game. People from around the world ask me if the game has a religious connection. Many religions share an affinity with ''Journey''—this is because many religions partly share a common structure". Chen said ''Journey'' is based upon [[Joseph Campbell]]'s book on comparative mythology ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'' and the [[Monomyth|"Hero's Journey"]] narrative structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/religion-friendship-and-emotion-a-journey-post-mortem/1100-6367138/|title=Religion, friendship, and emotion: A Journey post-mortem|work=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/180290-journey-as-ritual/|title='Journey' As Ritual|work=[[PopMatters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of [[Leonard Nimoy]], ''[[Star Trek Online]]'' added two statues in his honor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/06/leonard-nimoy-memorials-added-to-star-trek-online?%20|title=Leonard Nimoy Memorials Added to Star Trek Online|first=Luke|last=Karmali|date=6 March 2015|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' added a [[non-player character]] (NPC) based upon [[Robin Williams]] after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/12/robin-williams-to-be-memorialized-in-wow|title=Robin Williams to Be Memorialized in WoW|first=David|last=Witmer|date=12 August 2014|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/08/apparent-robin-williams-model-found-in-world-of-warcraft/|title=Apparent Robin Williams Models Found In World Of Warcraft|first=Patricia|last=Hernandez|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developer [[Gearbox Software]] honored a late fan of ''[[Borderlands (video game)|Borderlands]]'', cancer victim Michael John Mamaril, by adding a NPC named after him in [[Borderlands 2|the sequel]]. Additionally, Gearbox posted a eulogy to Mamaril in the voice of the game character Claptrap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/gearbox-to-honor-late-fan-as-an-npc-in-borderlands-2-215160.phtml|title=Gearbox to honor late fan as an NPC in Borderlands 2|publisher=[[Destructoid]]|first=Tony|last=Ponce|date=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For their game ''[[MechWarrior Online]]'', developer [[Piranha Games]] sold a custom in-game unit called a Jenner, honoring the daughter of a player of the game. [[Canadian dollar|CAD]]122,210 was donated to the Canadian Cancer Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/online-gamers-donate-122-210-in-memory-of-5-year-old-1.1302334|title=Online gamers donate $122,210 in memory of 5-year-old|date=23 August 2013|work=[[CBC.ca]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Losing his wife Pauline to ovarian cancer, ''[[Minecraft]]'' player "GasBandit" built a memorial for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/5-Touching-Memorials-Video-Games-70528-p2.html|title=5 Touching Memorials In Video Games|work=Cinema Blend|publisher=Gateway Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; When players of the online game ''[[Final Fantasy XIV]]'' heard that fellow gamer "Codex Vahla" was in the hospital on life support, they held a digital [[wake (ceremony)|wake]].&lt;ref&gt;Fahey, M.

===Religious video games===
{{see also|Christian video game|Islamic Fun}}
Some religious groups use video games for education. An example is the Christian game ''[[Left Behind: Eternal Forces]]''.

===Use of video games in a religious setting===
In May 2012, the [[Exeter Cathedral]] used ''[[Flower (video game)|Flower]]'' during its Sunday service.&lt;ref&gt;Narcisse, E. (2012) A PlayStation 3 Game Will Be Part of a Church Service This Sunday, Retrieved 15 september 2015 on http://kotaku.com/5909361/this-sunday-video-games-go-to-church&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/9/3010257/exeter-cathedral-flower-service|title=UK cathedral to use 'Flower' video game as part of upcoming service|first=Andrew|last=Webster|date=9 May 2012|work=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
{{See also|Video game controversy}}
Opinions on video games differ from religion and denomination; there are religious groups that use games actively to convert people, while some games are [[List of banned video games|banned]] for religious reasons. Scholars of religious studies are also studying video games, by looking at the game and to the players and their experiences, with games like ''[[Journey (2012 video game)|Journey]]''  Religion is considered a serious real world topic, while video games are an art and entertainment.&lt;ref name="Kotaku Good"/&gt; As such, developers and publishers sometimes take precaution not to offend people's religious beliefs. Religious references in the Japanese role-playing video game series ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' were originally censored for the U.S. release of the games. It was after the franchise switched to Sony's [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] with ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'' (1997) that the religious references were left largely intact.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, A. The Religions Behind Final Fantasy. History of Computer Game Design: Technology, Culture, and Business March 22, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Ubisoft's ''Assassin's Creed'' series show a disclaimer: {{blockquote| "Inspired by historical events and characters. This work of fiction was designed, developed and produced by a multicultural team of various religious faiths and beliefs."&lt;ref name="Kotaku Good"/&gt;{{efn|In ''[[Assassin's Creed: Syndicate]]'', the words "sexual orientations and gender identities" were added.}}}}

Despite efforts from some companies, there have been incidents with religious groups and video games. The German video game rating board [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle|USK]] gave ''[[The Binding of Isaac (video game)|The Binding of Isaac]]'' a 16+ rating, considering it "[[Blasphemy|blasphemous]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/182380/postmortem_mcmillen_and_himsls_.php?print=1 |title=Postmortem: McMillen and Himsl's ''The Binding of Isaac'' |last=McMillen |first=Edmund |authorlink=Edmund McMillen |date=November 28, 2012 |accessdate=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
The game ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'' is heavily based on the notion of [[American exceptionalism]] at the turn of the 19th century, and incorporates notions taken from Christianity to support the game's dystopian themes. One aspect of this was the use of [[baptism]]. One developer on [[Irrational Games]] staff expressed strong concern to the lead developer, [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]], that the game's presentation of baptism was highly controversial, leading Levine to with the developer to recast the baptism aspect as a notion of forgiveness rather than a religious tenet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.officialplaystationmagazine.co.uk/2013/01/18/bioshock-infinite-altered-after-conversations-with-religious-people-on-the-team-says-levine/ | title = Bioshock Infinite altered after "conversations with religious people on the team" says Levine | first = Leon | last = Hurley | date = January 18, 2013 | accessdate = January 20, 2013 | work = [[PlayStation Official Magazine (UK)]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130122031459/http://www.officialplaystationmagazine.co.uk/2013/01/18/bioshock-infinite-altered-after-conversations-with-religious-people-on-the-team-says-levine/ | archivedate = January 22, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/news/bioshock-infinites-religious-themes-led-dev-to-consider-quitting-6404620 | title = BioShock Infinite's religious themes led dev to consider quitting | first = Eddie | last = Makuch | date = February 28, 2013 | accessdate = February 28, 2013 | publisher = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/03/01/bioshock-infinite-artist-almost-resigned-over-antagonists-religious-views/ | title = BioShock Infinite artist almost resigned over game's depiction of religion | last = Petitte | first = Omri | date = March 1, 2013 | work= [[PC Gamer]] | accessdate= March 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one player objected to the final changes, prompting them to request a refund from [[Steam (software)|Steam]].&lt;ref name="kotaku refund"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/some-dont-like-bioshocks-forced-baptism-enough-to-as-473178476 | title = Some Don't Like BioShock's Forced Baptism.

On October 22, 2008, Microsoft announced that ''[[Fallout 3]]'' would not be released in India on the [[Xbox 360]] platform.&lt;ref name="Kotaku-India"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5067039/fallout-3-not-coming-to-india |title=Fallout 3 Not Coming To India |publisher=Kotaku |date=2008-10-22 |accessdate=2010-04-20 |first=Mike |last=Fahey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious and cultural sentiments were cited as the reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/fallout-3-withheld-from-india |title=Fallout 3 withheld from India |publisher=Games Industry |accessdate=2009-12-01 |first=Jason |last=Lee |date=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the specific reason was not revealed in public, it is possible that it is because the game contains two-headed mutated cows called Brahmin, or that [[Brahmin]] is also the name of an ancient, powerful hereditary caste of [[Hindu]] priests and religious scholars in India, or its similarity to the spelling of [[brahman (cattle)|brahman]], a type of cow that originated in India. Brahman, a breed of [[Zebu]], are revered by Hindus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Are-Brahmin-The-Reason-For-Fallout-3-s-Cancellation-in-India-12947.html |title=Are Brahmin The Reason For Fallout 3's Cancellation in India? |publisher=Gaming Blend |accessdate=2011-09-04 |date=2008-10-22 |first=Pete |last=Haas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The action game ''Hanuman: Boy Warrior'' was criticized by Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, for portraying the Hindu deity [[Hanuman]]. Developed and published in India by Aurona Technologies, the player controls Hanuman. "Controlling and manipulating Lord Hanuman with a joystick/button/keyboard/mouse [is] denigration", said Zed. "Lord Hanuman was not meant to be reduced to just a 'character' in a video game to solidify [a] company/product's base in the growing economy of India." He urged Sony, the publisher of the game, to pull the game. Sony's regional manager however said that ''Hanuman: Boy Warrior'' sold beyond their expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/114224/Hindu_Statesman_Criticizes_Sonys_Hanuman_Boy_Warrior.php |title=Hindu Statesman Criticizes Sony's Hanuman: Boy Warrior |website=[[Gamasutra]] |accessdate=2016-02-16 |date=2009-04-20 |first=Leigh |last=Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/5217826/indias-first-game-gets-indias-first-game-controversy |title=India's First Game Gets India's First Game Controversy |website=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=2016-02-16 |date=2009-04-18 |first=Owen |last=Good}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamepolitics.com/2009/04/17/hindus-protest-ps2-game-released-india/|title=Hindus Protest PS2 Game Released in India|work=GamePolitics|date=2009-04-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420175535/http://www.gamepolitics.com/2009/04/17/hindus-protest-ps2-game-released-india|archivedate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zed was also critical of the use of [[Hindu deities]] in the [[Multiplayer online battle arena|MOBA]] game ''[[Smite (video game)|Smite]]''. In response, developer [[Hi-Rez Studios]] COO Todd Harris said that ''Smite'' would still be featuring Hindu deities, possibly adding more. GameSpot asked if characters based upon Abrahamic religions would be added as well, but Harris said that "the key Abrahimic figures—Adam, Noah, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, are not that interesting in character design or gameplay".&lt;ref&gt;Connor Sheridan on June 29, 2012, http://www.gamespot.com/articles/deity-based-moba-smite-will-not-use-jewish-christian-islamic-figures/1100-6384974/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
''[[LittleBigPlanet (PlayStation 3)|LittleBigPlanet]]'' (2008) had a last-minute delay involving a licensed song in the game's soundtrack,&lt;ref name=delay&gt;{{cite web| url=http://threespeech.com/blog/2008/10/littlebigplanet-scees-official-statement/|title=LittleBigPlanet – SCEE's official statement|author=Three Speech|date=17 October 2008|accessdate=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a PlayStation Community member reported the lyrics to one of the licensed songs in the game included passages from the [[Qur'an]] and could therefore be offensive to [[Muslim]]s. However, no actual complaints regarding the music were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.eu.playstation.com/t5/LittleBigPlanet/very-urgent-about-little-big-planet-lbp/td-p/5627909 |date=16 October 2008 |author=yasser (solid08) |title=very urgent about little big planet lbp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601131006/http://community.eu.playstation.com/t5/LittleBigPlanet/very-urgent-about-little-big-planet-lbp/td-p/5627909 |archivedate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song, entitled "Tapha Niang", was by [[Mali]]an artist [[Toumani Diabaté]], himself a devout Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/technology/machinist/blog/2008/10/20/islam_sony| title = Sony recalls LittleBigPlanet over Quran quote in music | date = 20 October 2008 | accessdate=2 January 2010 | publisher=Machinist: Salon.com | first = Cyrus | last = Farivar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/21/worldmusic|title=The generation game – Music – The Guardian|date=21 February 2008|accessdate=20 October 2008|publisher=The Guardian | first = Robin | last = Denselow | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was patched twice, the day before its release for players who had received the game early, before its intended release date.

M.

The [[fighting game]] ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' was temporarily banned in the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name=Ban&gt;{{cite web|url=http://me.ign.com/en/news/10356/injustice-gods-among-us-banned-in-uae-kuwait|date=2013-04-29|accessdate=2013-05-08|last=Fakhruddin|first=Mufaddal|publisher=[[IGN|IGN Middle East]]|title=Injustice: Gods Among Us Banned in UAE, Kuwait}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/injustice-gods-among-us-video-game-not-available-in-uae|date=2013-04-30|accessdate=2013-05-08|last=Hanif|first=Nadeem|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|title='Injustice: Gods Among Us' video game not available in UAE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the title of the game was rebranded as ''Injustice: The Mighty Among Us'' for promotional uses in those areas.&lt;ref name=Ban/&gt; It is speculated that ''Injustice'' was banned because of the inclusion of the word 'Gods' in the title, the cleavage exposed in the outfits of some female characters, and overall bloodiness.&lt;ref name=Ban/&gt; Eventually, the ban in the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait was lifted.&lt;ref name=Ban/&gt;

===Sikhism===
''[[Hitman 2: Silent Assassin]]'' (2002) sparked controversy due to a level featuring the killing of [[Sikh]]s within a depiction of their most holy site, the [[Harmandir Sahib]], where hundreds of Sikhs [[1984 anti-Sikh riots|were massacred in 1984]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/sci_tech/newsid_2440000/2440713.stm |title=Young Sikhs force changes to Hitman 2 |publisher=[[CBBC]] |date=21 November 2002|accessdate=28 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An altered version of ''Silent Assassin'' was eventually released with the related material removed from the game.

==Religion and violence==
A study released by the University of Missouri stated that video games often emphasize the violent aspects of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5888663/study-says-video-games-have-problematized-view-of-religion|title=Study Says Video Games Have 'Problematized' View of Religion|first=Jason|last=Schreier|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher Greg Perreault said "It doesn't appear that game developers are trying to purposefully bash organized religion in these games, I believe they are only using religion to create stimulating plot points in their story lines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://munews.missouri.edu/news-releases/2012/0227-video-games-depict-religion-as-violent-problematized-mu-study-shows/|title=Video Games Depict Religion as Violent, Problematized, MU Study Shows|publisher=MU News Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games as focus of religious studies==
{{main|Game studies}}

For many years video games were seen as mere [[entertainment]], a form of "low culture".&lt;ref&gt;Mäyrä, F. An Introduction to Game Studies (2008). SAGE Publications. Page 30&lt;/ref&gt; Playing video games was seen as a form of [[escapism]]&lt;ref&gt;Cuddy, L. (ed.) The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy (2008). Open Court, Chicago. Page 58&lt;/ref&gt; and the medium was not regarded as a valid object of scientific research. To "play" games as a scholarly pursuit was thought of as "ludicrous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://criticalreligion.org/2013/10/21/here-be-dragons-the-quest-for-academic-credibility/|title=Here Be Dragons: the quest for academic credibility|work=The Critical Religion Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has only been in recent years that video games have become the object of scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, J. Videogames (2012). Routledge. Page 10&lt;/ref&gt; Looking at the game as an object, researchers can explore religious and spiritual references. Video game research is done in two ways; the game can be studied as an [[object (philosophy)|object]], while [[actant|actor-focused]] research looks at the player.

===Game-immanent approach===
Video games, as products of human culture, can be seen and read as "[[Text (literary theory)|texts]]". They carry myths, stories and symbols of the time in which they were created.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Campbell, H. (ed.). Digital Religion: Understanding Religious Practice in New Media Worlds (2012). Rutledge. Page 145&lt;/ref&gt; By "reading" video games, philosophers, sociologists and theologians have the opportunity to study the religious and spiritual themes in video games.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, H. A. en Grieve, G. P. Studying Religion in Digital Gaming. A Critical Review of an Emerging Field. In Heidbrink, S. en Knoll, T. (ed.) Religion in Digital Games. Multiperspective &amp; Interdisciplinary Approaches. Volume 05 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; This can be done in several ways.

*by studying the design, rules and mechanics or by talking to the developers
*by watching others play (e.g. [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play videos]])
*by playing the game themselves&lt;ref&gt;[[Espen Aarseth]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Player-focused approach===

Video games are [[Interactivity|interactive]]; it requires input from the player to happen. While a video game developer designs the game, including its rules and story, it is up to the player to make the game "happen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Luke |editor-last=Cuddy |title=The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy: I Link Therefore I Am |date=2008 |publisher=Open Court |location=Chicago |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; As such, it is up to individual player to give [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]] to their experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Newman |first=James |title=Videogames |date=2012 |publisher=Routledge |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video games allow the player to think, form and possibly change their own opinion about religious and spiritual matters.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Players often discuss these elements on online platforms. For instance, some players made their own version of the player character [[Commander Shepard]] of the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' series an atheist, while others thought of him/her{{efn|Commander Shepard can be female or male.}} as a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Knoll, T. "Are Those the Only Two Solutions?" In Heidbrink, S., Knoll, T. Wysocki, J. (ed.) Religion in Digital Games Reloaded. Immersion into the Field. Volume 07 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; As such, video games also give new meaning to the concept of religion.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

'''Richard Twiss''' (June 11, 1954 – February 9, 2013) was a Native American educator and author. He was a member of the [[Sicangu Lakota Oyate]]. He was the Co-Founder and President of [[Wiconi International]] ({{lang-lkt|Wee-choe'-nee|lit=life}}).&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

His vision was, "Serve as a bridge builder and consultant, nationally and internationally, to develop understanding, respect and mutual appreciation for one another, especially among Native American/First Nations people."{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Biography ==
Richard's father, Franklin "Buster" Twiss (May 7, 1927– August 17, 1999) was an enrolled member of the [[Pine Ridge Reservation|Pine Ridge]] [[Oglala Lakota]] tribe in South Dakota and was a [[Sergeant First Class|SFC]] Army veteran. His mother, Winona LaPointe is from the [[Sicangu Lakota]] from the [[Rosebud Indian Reservation]] in [[Norris, South Dakota]], and she attended the St. Francis Indian Mission School as a young girl through high school graduation.

In 1972, Richard Twiss was a participant in the forced occupation of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] Building in Washington, D.C., with the radical political group, the [[American Indian Movement]]. Twiss later became a Christian minister, author, and public speaker. He married his wife Katherine in 1976 and had four grown sons, residing in [[Vancouver, Washington]] since 1981.

Twiss was a Board Member of the Christian Community Development Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccda.org/about/leadership/61-board |title=Board - Christian Community Development Association |publisher=Christian Community Development Association |date= |accessdate=2013-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712174226/http://www.ccda.org/about/leadership/61-board |archivedate=2012-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; founded by [[John M.

{{Communion}}
'''Sacramental bread''', sometimes called '''altar bread''', '''Communion bread''', the '''[[Lamb (liturgy)|Lamb]]''' or simply the '''host''' ({{lang-la|hostia}}), is the bread used in the Christian ritual of the [[Eucharist]] (also referred to as the Lord's Supper or Holy Communion, among other names). Along with [[sacramental wine]], it is one of two "elements" of the Eucharist. The bread may be either [[leavened]] or unleavened (appearing as a [[wafer]]), depending on tradition. Eastern and Western traditions both require that it be made from wheat.

[[Roman Catholic]] theology generally teaches that at the [[Words of Institution]] the bread is changed into the [[Body of Christ]] (see [[transubstantiation]]), whereas Eastern Christian theology generally views the [[epiclesis]] as the point at which the change occurs. Some [[Protestants]] believe [[transignification]] occurs at the Words of Institution.

==Etymology of ''host''==
The word "host" is derived from the [[Latin]] ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#hostia|hostia]]'', which means "[[sacrifice|sacrificial victim]]."  The term can be used to describe the bread both before and after [[consecration]], though it is more correct to use it after consecration. Prior to consecration, the term "altar bread" is preferred. The sacrifice of Jesus according to Christian theology puts an end to the need for animal sacrifice as had been practiced in the Jerusalem Temple and all blood sacrifice once-for-all. However the word was retained to describe the bread of Eucharist as a liturgical representation of the Christ's sacrifice.

==Eastern traditions==
[[Image:Patene-byzantine.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Lamb (liturgy)|Lamb]] and particles placed on the [[diskos]] during the [[Liturgy of Preparation]] for the [[Divine Liturgy]]]]

{{main|Prosphora|Azymes}}

With the exception of Churches of the [[Armenian Rite]], [[Orthodox Church]]es and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] use [[leaven]]ed bread for the Eucharist. Thus, the sacramental bread symbolizes the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrected Christ]].  The ''hostia'' or sacramental bread, known as ''[[prosphora|prosphorá]]'' or a πρόσφορον (''prósphoron'', "offering") may be made out of only four ingredients: fine (white) [[wheat flour]], pure water, yeast, and salt. Sometimes [[holy water]] will be either sprinkled into the dough or on the kneading trough at the beginning of the process.

===Armenian rite===
Because leaven is symbolic of sin, the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] and the [[Armenian Apostolic Orthodox Church]] traditionally offer unleavened bread (although it is distinctively different from the kind used by the [[Roman Catholic Church]]) to symbolize the sinlessness of [[Christ]].

===Eastern Orthodox Churches===
The baking may only be performed by a believing Orthodox [[Christian]] in good standing—having preferably been recently to [[Confession (religion)|Confession]], and is accompanied by prayer and fasting. Before baking, each loaf is formed by placing two disks of dough, one on top of the other, and stamping it with a special liturgical seal. The prosphora should be fresh and not stale or moldy when presented at the [[altar]] for use in the [[Divine Liturgy]]. Often several prosphora will be baked and offered by the faithful, and the priest chooses the best one for the [[Lamb (liturgy)|Lamb]] (Host) that will be [[consecrated]].  The remaining loaves are blessed and offered back to the congregation after the end of the [[Divine Liturgy]] (Eucharist); this bread is called the ''[[antidoron]]'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: αντίδωρον, ''antídōron''), i.e. a "gift returned," or "in place of the gifts."

===Eastern Catholic Churches===
The [[Byzantine Rite]] [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] (like the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]) use leavened bread for [[Prosphora]] (the Greek word for Eucharistic altar bread).

The [[Syro-Malabar Church]] and the [[Maronite Church]] have adopted the use of unleavened bread due to [[Liturgical Latinisation]].

==Western traditions==
===Roman Catholic Church===
[[Image:Kleste na hostie detail.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of tongs for baking hosts]]

A '''Host''' is a portion of bread used for [[Holy Communion]] in many [[Christian]] churches.  In [[Western Christianity]] the host is often a thin, round [[azymes|unleavened]] [[wafer]].

In the [[Roman Rite]], [[unleavened bread]] is used as in the Jewish [[Passover]] or Feast of Unleavened Bread. The [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Code of Canon Law]], [http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3A.HTM Canon 924] requires that the hosts be made from wheat flour and water only and recently made so that there is no danger of spoiling.

Hosts are often made by [[nun]]s as a means of supporting their religious communities. However, in New Zealand, the St Vincent de Paul Society hires individuals with intellectual disabilities to bake, cut out and sort the bread, thereby offering paid employment to those who wouldn't have that option otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vinnies-wellington.org.nz/altar-breads/|title=Altar Breads|author=|date=|website=vinnies-wellington.org.nz|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]] §321 recommends that "the eucharistic bread ... be made in such a way that the priest at Mass with a congregation is able in practice to break it into parts for distribution to at least some of the faithful. ... The action of the [[fraction (religion)|fraction]] or breaking of bread, which gave its name to the [[Eucharist]] in apostolic times, will bring out more clearly the force and importance of the sign of unity of all in the one bread, and of the sign of charity by the fact that the one bread is distributed among the brothers and sisters."

In 1995 [[Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger]], then Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, wrote a letter to the Episcopal Conferences in which he expanded the Code of Canon Law, stating that low-[[gluten]] bread would be considered “valid matter” for hosts as long as no additional substances “alter[ed] the nature of the substance of the bread.”&lt;ref name="thinkprogress.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/12/29/3607228/low-gluten-communion-wafers/|title=Low-Gluten Diet Alternatives Have Reached A New Frontier: The Catholic Church|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 2000s, hosts with low gluten content have been manufactured in the United States, especially in parts of Missouri and New York.&lt;ref name="thinkprogress.org"/&gt; Hosts are one of the causes of lack of recovery for people with [[celiac disease]] who follow a [[gluten-free diet]],&lt;ref name=CiacciCiclitira2015&gt;{{cite journal| author=Ciacci C, Ciclitira P, Hadjivassiliou M, Kaukinen K, Ludvigsson JF, McGough N et al.| title=The gluten-free diet and its current application in coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis. | journal=United European Gastroenterol J | year= 2015 | volume= 3 | issue= 2 | pages= 121–35 | pmid=25922672 | doi=10.1177/2050640614559263 | pmc=4406897 | type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; which must be strict and maintained for life to allow the recovery of the intestinal mucosa and reduce the risk of developing severe health complications.&lt;ref name=SeeKaukinen2015&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=See JA, Kaukinen K, Makharia GK, Gibson PR, Murray JA|title=Practical insights into gluten-free diets|journal=Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol|volume=12|issue=10|pages=580–91|date=Oct 2015|pmid=26392070|doi=10.1038/nrgastro.2015.156|type=Review|quote=A lack of symptoms and/or negative serological markers are not reliable indicators of mucosal response to the diet.

===Protestantism===
[[Image:Methodistcommunion6.jpg|thumb|[[United Methodist]] [[Elder (Methodism)|Elder]] presiding at the Eucharist, using a leavened loaf of bread]]

In the varying [[Protestant]] denominations, there is a wide variety of practices concerning the sacramental bread used. Some, such as the [[Christian Congregation of Brazil|Christian Congregation]] use leavened loaves of bread, others, such as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]s, continue to use unleavened [[wafer]]s like the Roman Catholics, and some use [[matzo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wecker|first1=Menachem|title=Matzah Communion|url=http://ajlmagazine.com/content/112006/matzah.html|website=American Jewish Life Magazine|accessdate=16 April 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314094031/http://ajlmagazine.com/content/112006/matzah.html|archivedate=2016-03-14|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reformed]] Christians use rolls which are [[fractio panis (practice)|broken]] and distributed to symbolize their belief that Christ is [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist#Reformed: "pneumatic presence"|not physically present in the bread]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Benedict |first=Philip |author-link=Philip Benedict |title=Christ's Churches Purely Reformed |location=New Haven |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |year=2002 |isbn=978-0300105070 |page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who use the unleavened wafers, there is a great deal of variation: some are square or triangular rather than round, and may even be made out of [[whole wheat flour]].

==Latter-day Saints==
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons) has no strict rules on the type of bread used for sacramental purposes. Latter-day Saint scriptures state: "For, behold, I say unto you, that it mattereth not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink when ye partake of the sacrament, if it so be that ye do it with an eye single to my glory—remembering unto the Father my body which was laid down for you, and my blood which was shed for the remission of your sins." ([[Doctrine and Covenants]] 27:2) Different congregations may use either commercial bread or homemade bread prepared by members of the congregation. It is permissible to substitute rice cakes or other gluten-free breads for members who suffer from food allergies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Christianson|first=Thira|title=Accepting Allergies|url=http://lds.org/friend/2011/09/accepting-allergies?lang=eng|work=Friend|publisher=Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bread is broken into fragments just prior to being blessed by one of the officiating [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priests]].
==In popular culture==
{{trivia|date=October 2018}}
In [[Bram Stoker]]’s 1897 novel [[Dracula (novel)|Dracula]], sacramental bread (referred to as sacred communion wafers) is used to ward off vampires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.shmoop.com/dracula/communion-sacred-wafer-symbol.html |title=COMMUNION AND THE SACRED WAFER |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |access-date=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Universal Sufism}}
All [[Sufi]] orders have their own ''[[Silsila]]'' or Chain of Transmission. The representation of the Chain of Transmission is called the ''Shajara'' ("Tree"). Below is that of the [[Sufi Order Ināyati]] up to [[Inayat Khan]]. The Shajara which appears here is that of [[Inayat Khan]]'s primary spiritual lineage, the [[Chishti]] Order, although he was also initiated into the [[Suhrawardiyya|Suhrawardi]], [[Naqshbandi]] and [[Qadiri]] Sufi orders.

Silsilas always begin with God, so the ''Shajara'' will begin with the name [[Allah]], but in the [[Western Sufist]] context this should not be confined to the concept of Allah within Islam, but should be seen as [[Spirit of Guidance|Universal Intelligence]]. The Sufi Order International ''shajra'' is in fact derived until Inayat Khan, from the Chishti-Nizami line of traditional Chishti Sufism but branches off later, on its own thereafter.

'''Thomas Charles Lethbridge''' (23 March 1901 – 30 September 1971), better known as '''T. C. Lethbridge''', was an English [[archaeologist]], [[parapsychology|parapsychologist]], and [[exploration|explorer]]. A specialist in [[Anglo-Saxon archaeology]], he served as honorary Keeper of Anglo-Saxon Antiquities at the [[Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge|Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] from 1923 to 1957, and over the course of his lifetime wrote twenty-four books on various subjects, becoming particularly well known for his advocacy of [[dowsing]].

Born in [[Somerset]] to a wealthy family, Lethbridge was educated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], during the course of which he attended an expedition to [[Jan Mayen]] island, becoming part of the first group to successfully climb the [[Beerenberg]]. After a failed second expedition to the [[Arctic Circle]], he became involved in archaeology. In his capacity as Keeper of Anglo-Saxon Antiquities at the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Lethbridge carried out [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] at various sites around Britain. His claims regarding the existence of [[Iron Age Britain|Iron Age]] [[hill figure]]s on [[Wandlebury Hill]] in [[Cambridgeshire]] caused significant controversy within the archaeological community, with most archaeologists believing that Lethbridge had erroneously misidentified a natural feature. Lethbridge's methodology and theories were widely deemed unorthodox, and in turn he became increasingly critical of the archaeological profession.

After resigning from the university museum in 1957, Lethbridge moved with his wife to [[Branscombe]], [[Devon]]. There he devoted himself to researching [[paranormal]] phenomena, publishing a string of books on the subject aimed at a popular rather than academic audience. Most of this involved his research into the use of [[pendulum]]s for dowsing, although in other publications he championed the [[witch-cult hypothesis]] of [[Margaret Murray]], articulated the [[Stone Tape]] theory as an explanation for [[ghost]] sightings, and argued that [[Ancient astronaut hypothesis|extraterrestrial species were involved in shaping human evolution]]; in this he came to embrace and perpetuate the [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] ideas of the [[Earth mysteries]] movement. Although his work in parapsychology was derided and ignored as [[pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] by the academic establishment, he attracted a cult following, and his work was posthumously championed by esotericists like [[Colin Wilson]] and [[Julian Cope]]. In 2011 he was made the subject of a biography by Terry Welbourn.

==Early life==

===Youth: 1901–21===
Thomas Charles Lethbridge was born on 23 March 1901.{{sfnm|1a1=Anonymous|1y=1972|1p=448|2a1=Welbourn|2y=2011|2p=19}} His parents, Violet Lethbridge (née Murdoch) and her husband Ambrose Lethbridge, were wealthy and lived at Knowle House in [[Timberscombe]], Somerset in south-west England, where they employed seven servants.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=19}} The family's fortune stemmed from Ambrose's father Charles Lethbridge, who had married the wealthy coal heiress Susan Anne Yarburgh.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=19}} Neither Charles nor Ambrose had to earn a living, and as gentlemen of "independent means" spent their time engaged in rural hobbies.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=19–20}} By 1907 the Lethbridge family had moved to Lewell Lodge, [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] in Dorset, where Violet gave birth to daughter Jacintha in June.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=20}} They then moved to a house named Trevissome in [[Flushing, Cornwall|Flushing]], Cornwall, where a second son, Ambrose "Bill" William Speke Lethbridge, was born.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=20}} Thomas' father Ambrose contracted [[tuberculosis]] at the end of the decade, resulting in the family moving into Charles' house in [[Heytesbury]], Wiltshire, where Ambrose died in September 1909, aged 34.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=20–21}}

Around this time, Thomas developed an interest in [[archaeology]], [[entomology]], and [[ornithology]], as well as drawing.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=21}} In 1913 his family made plans for him to join the [[Royal Navy]], although he failed the entrance exam due to alleged poor eyesight.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=22}} At the outbreak of the First World War, Lethbridge was sent to [[Wellington College (Berkshire)|Wellington College]] in Berkshire, while his mother and siblings moved to [[Buckhurst]] in [[Wokingham]], Berkshire.{{sfnm|1a1=Anonymous|1y=1972|1p=448|2a1=Finneran|2y=2003|2p=107|3a1=Welbourn|3y=2011|3p=23}} In February 1919 Violet and her children moved to Manor House in [[Finchampstead]], where Jacintha and Bill became seriously ill [[1918 flu pandemic|as a result of a flu pandemic]]; the former survived but Bill died in March.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=24}}

===University and Jan Mayen: 1921–23===
In October 1921 Lethbridge enrolled at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], intent on studying geology and geography. Finding geology to be "crushingly dull", he rarely attended lectures and took little interest in his studies, instead spending much of his time shooting, fishing, and sailing. He graduated with a [[Third-class degree#Third-class honours|third class]] BA in June 1923.{{sfnm|1a1=Finneran|1y=2003|1p=107|2a1=Welbourn|2y=2011|2pp=24–26, 41}}

[[File:Beerenberg Jan Mayen.JPG|left|thumb|250px|Lethbridge was part of the first expedition to climb the Beerenberg, pictured.]]

During his studies Lethbridge decided to join an expedition to visit [[Jan Mayen]] island in the [[Arctic Circle]], alongside fellow Cambridge students James Chaworth-Musters and William Syer Bristowe and a don from [[St. John's College, Cambridge]], the geologist [[James Wordie]].{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=28–29}} Although initially planning to travel independently, they decided to join a Norwegian expedition led by Hagbord Ekerold and accompanied by Swiss mountaineer and glaciologist [[Paul Louis Mercanton]].{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=29}} The expedition set sail from [[Bratvaag]] aboard two ships in August 1921, and upon arriving at Jan Mayen they became the first team to successfully climb the [[Beerenberg]].{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=29–33}} During the expedition, Lethbridge was also able to explore his growing interest in archaeology by [[excavation (archaeology)|excavating]] at an abandoned [[Eskimo]] settlement.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=34}} ''[[The Times]]'' recognised the expedition as the mountaineering event of the year.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=34}}

At Cambridge, Lethbridge had entered into a romantic relationship with Sylvia Robertson, a clergyman's daughter, and they were engaged to be married in March 1922.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=62}}
In mid-1922 he went on a sailing voyage around the [[Hebrides]] in Scotland with his fellow Trinity student Geoffrey Walford.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=41–42}}
In summer 1923 Lethbridge was part of a second expedition led by Wordie, designed to explore the eastern coast of [[Greenland]] to conduct geological and archaeological investigations and repeat [[Edward Sabine]]'s pendulum gravity experiments. Sailing from [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], they stopped first at [[Bergen]] and then Jan Meyen before getting stuck in [[drift ice|pack ice]]. With food reserves running low, the crew resorted to killing and eating [[grey seals]] and [[polar bear]]s, before they eventually aborted the mission and returned home.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=35–39}}

==Archaeological career==

===Becoming Keeper of Anglo-Saxon Antiquities: 1923–47===
During his student years, Lethbridge had frequented the [[Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge|Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]], where he had befriended its curator, [[L.C.G. Clarke|Louis Clarke]].{{sfnm|1a1=Finneran|1y=2003|1p=107|2a1=Welbourn|2y=2011|2pp=49–50}} Upon Lethbridge's graduation, Clarke offered him the honorary position of Keeper of Anglo-Saxon Antiquities at the museum. Lethbridge took up the voluntary and unpaid post, being able to subsist on his family's finances.{{sfnm|1a1=Finneran|1y=2003|1p=108|2a1=Welbourn|2y=2011|2p=50}} There, Lethbridge befriended the archaeologist [[Cyril Fox]], aiding in Fox's excavation of the [[Devil's Dyke, Cambridgeshire|Devil's Dyke]] in Cambridgeshire.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=52–54}} Lethbridge's archaeological excavations were however deemed of poor quality by many of his peers.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=60}} In turn, Lethbridge derided the archaeological establishment, being frustrated by how long it took them to accept what he deemed to be "facts", and he believed in focusing on what he believed to be [[instinct]] and [[common sense]].{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=60}} There were exceptions to his scorn; for instance, he developed a friendship with [[T. D. Kendrick]], an Anglo-Saxon art historian who then worked as Keeper of the [[British Museum]] in London.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=128}} Over the course of his career at the museum, Lethbridge produced 60 archaeological reports, written in an unusually informal manner that used humour and wit and included narrative descriptions of the excavation process.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=77–79}}

In February 1924, Lethbridge married Sylvia Robertson in a ceremony held at [[Salisbury Cathedral]].{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=62–63}} Together they moved into a house known as The Lodge in [[Waterbeach]].{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=63}} There, their first two sons were born: Christopher John in March 1925 and Hugh Periam in July 1926.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=65–66}} In 1927, they moved to Mount Blow, a house in [[Great Shelford|Shelford]] designed by architect [[Edwin Lutyens]].{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=66}} It was there that Sylvia gave birth to a daughter, Belinda Mary, in April 1930.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=67}} Sylvia suffered from mental illness however, resulting in repeated hospitalisation.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=67, 75}} Lethbridge meanwhile devoted much of his time to yachting around the British Isles, sometimes taking family members with him.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=67–71}} Over the course of the 1930s he self-published a series of books featuring his own sketches and engravings of maritime scenes.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=71}} He also deepened his interest in the [[paranormal]] during this period, coming to believe that an acquaintance of his was a genuine [[psychic]] and observing an [[unidentified flying object]] in [[Bracknell]].{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=72–75, 77}}

In 1937, Wordie organised an expedition to North West Greenland to investigate [[cosmic radiation]] at high latitudes and great altitudes. He assembled a team of ten men, nine of whom were from Cambridge University, among them Lethbridge and two other archaeologists.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=81}} Setting sail in June 1937, Lethbridge undertook excavations of Eskimo sites at [[Rhyder Island]], [[Cary Island]], [[North West Island]], and [[Isbjörn Island]].{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=82–83}} On returning home in October 1937, it was decided that various geographical features encountered would be named after team members, and thus two lakes on [[Baffin Island]] were named the Lethbridge Lakes.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=83–85}} During the trip, Lethbridge became particularly interested in the design of Eskimo boats, resulting in the self-publication of his 11-page booklet, ''Umiak – the European Ancestry of the 'Women's Boat''', in 1937.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=86–87}} He followed this with a second book, ''The Fishermen of Durness'' (1938), in which he argued that a study of contemporary traditional fishing communities could inform archaeologists more about ancient boat-making and fishing.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=88}}

As the Second World War loomed, the British Admiralty commissioned Lethbridge to undertake a reconnaissance mission to Iceland to analyse German naval activity around the country, which he carried out in summer 1939. Lethbridge however treated the mission with contempt, spending much of the time visiting sites that interested him, such as locations mentioned in the Icelandic Sagas.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=89–94}} Back in Britain, he self-published a short volume discussing his Icelandic journey, ''News from Tili''.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=96}} As war broke out, Lethbridge organised the transfer of much of the museum's collections to [[Balsham Caves]] for safe keeping, while also becoming a warden of the [[Air Raid Precautions]].{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=95–96}} He also led the rescue excavation of ten prehistoric [[tumuli]] that were being destroyed to enable the construction of [[Snailwell Airfield]] for the [[Royal Air Force]].{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=96–97}}

Meanwhile, Lethbridge's wife Sylvia had been having affairs with various men, and he himself had begun an affair with Sylvia's younger cousin Mina, who was a secretary at the museum. The couple divorced in June 1943, and in November Lethbridge sold Mount Blow to pay a settlement to Sylvia.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=97–100}} He married Mina in July 1944 at [[Oban]], and together they moved from Cambridge to a farm on the Scottish island of [[Kerrera]], where Lethbridge excavated some local caves. But the couple found life on Kerrera too isolated and soon returned to Cambridge,{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=101–102}} despite Lethbridge's dislike of the place and most of the university staff whom he worked alongside.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=114–115}} He nevertheless continued his archaeological investigations, excavating an Anglo-Saxon cemetery at [[Lackford]] on Cavenham Heath, and involving himself in the investigation of the newly unearthed [[Mildenhall Treasure]], being the individual responsible for locating its probable discovery spot.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=102–115}} He was among the first to take an interest in the [[Burial in Anglo-Saxon England|cemeteries of the Mid Anglo-Saxon period]], believing that the lack of 'pagan' objects such as weapons reflected the fact that those buried in two seventh-century cemeteries were among the earliest Anglo-Saxon Christians.{{sfn|Geake|1992|p=84}} In January 1948, Lethbridge received word that his son Hugh had committed suicide after suffering [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] during his time in the armed forces.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=116–117}}

===Major publications and Gogmagog: 1948–57===
1948 also saw the publication of Lethbridge's first major book, ''Merlin's Island: Essays on Britain in the Dark Ages'', a collection of six essays on various elements of Early Medieval Britain. Representing Lethbridge's unorthodox and eclectic approach, it was aimed at a popular rather than academic audience, and although some academic reviewers were critical, it received much qualified praise.{{sfnm|1a1=Finneran|1y=2003|1p=108|2a1=Welbourn|2y=2011|2pp=116–121}} This was followed in 1950 by ''Herdsman and Hermits: Celtic Seafarers in the Northern Sea'', in which he returned to his interest in seafaring and boats. Containing a foreword by Kendrick, it was published by [[Bowes and Bowes]].{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=128–131, 135}} In 1952, Lethbridge published ''Coast Wise Craft'', which again looked at boat building but was aimed at a general rather than specialist readership.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=131–133}} That same year, [[Thames and Hudson]] published Lethbridge's ''Boats and Boatmen'' as part of their "The Past in the Present" series edited by archaeologist [[Jacquetta Hawkes]].{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=133}} In 1954, [[Andrew Melrose]] published Lethbridge's ''The Painted Men'', a book about the [[Picts]] of Northern Britain. It was deemed to be his last conventional book within the archaeological and academic community.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=143–146}} As part of his increasing public profile, the [[BBC]] invited him to give the third talk in their second series of ''Myth or Legend?'', which he devoted to the question of whether Europeans had arrived in the Americas prior to [[Christopher Columbus]]; in particular he looked at the claims that [[St. Brendan]] and [[Thorfinn Karlsefni]] had made the journey across the Atlantic.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=134–135}} Over several seasons he also carried out excavations of wheelhouses at [[South Uist]], and on one occasion was visited at the site by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=141–143}}

Lethbridge's next project focused on searching for a chalk [[hill figure]] that was reported to have once existed on [[Wandlebury Hill]] in the [[Gog Magog Hills]], Cambridgeshire. Towards the end of 1954 he began investigating the site, inserting metal rods into the ground to determine where he believed the turf had once been removed to expose the chalk below. He believed that he had revealed three large figures, a warrior, a hooded goddess, and a sun god, asserting them to be likely 3000 years old, and then began excavation to remove the turf and reveal the figures.{{sfnm|1a1=Finneran|1y=2003|1p=109|2a1=Welbourn|2y=2011|2pp=147–151|3a1=Gibson|3y=2013|3pp=93–94}} Lethbridge sought much publicity for his discovery, reporting on it to ''[[The Times]]'' and being interviewed by the ''[[London Evening News]]''.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=152–153}} However, many archaeologists were sceptical of Lethbridge's methodology and the existence of the hill figures; they believed that the soft patches of chalk were the result of chalk solifluction and were only interpreted as human-made figures through Lethbridge's vivid imagination.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=151}} The [[Council for British Archaeology]] brought together a committee to assess Lethbridge's findings, composed of I. W. Cornwall, [[W. F. Grimes]], [[Christopher Hawkes]], and [[Stuart Piggott]]. With the aid of geologist [[F. E. Zeuner]], the committee concluded that the shapes Lethbridge had discovered were natural, having been formed during the last [[Ice Age]]. However, Hawkes disagreed with his colleagues, and believed that while not proven, Lethbridge's conclusions could not be disproved.{{sfnm|1a1=Finneran|1y=2003|1p=109|2a1=Welbourn|2y=2011|2pp=152–154}} Lethbridge stuck by his original ideas, and wrote a book aimed at a general audience, ''Gogmagog – The Buried Gods'' on the basis of them. It was published by Routledge and Kegan Paul in 1957, but received no supportive reviews.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=154–157, 160–161}}
In May 1957, the Egyptologist [[Margaret Murray]] involved herself in the [[Gogmagog (folklore)|Gogmagog]] debate, championing Lethbridge's ideas against the academic fraternity in a letter she sent to ''[[The Times]]''. W. F. Grimes responded by claiming that she was out of touch with contemporary scholarship.{{sfnm|1a1=Welbourn|1y=2010|1p=40|2a1=Welbourn|2y=2011|2pp=157–159, 164–165}}

==Later life==

===Embracing parapsychology: 1957–64===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="There is really only one study of man, and this should be known as Anthropology. Medical Science, History, Archaeology, Folk Lore and the rest are all branches of the one study. But this present age is one of specialization and all the branches are tending to become so elaborate and, at the same time, so constricted that we are in need of trained middle-men, who have a wide enough grasp of all of them to pull the whole thing together and present it in a readable form to those who wish to learn."|source=— T.C. Lethbridge, 1962.{{sfn|Lethbridge|1962|p=ix}} }}

As a result of the widespread rejection of his ''Gogmagog'' claims, Lethbridge became increasingly critical of the academic and professional archaeological community, believing that an attitude of what he called "trade unionism" had caused most archaeologists to reject independent thought. As a result, he decided to resign and move away from Cambridge in late 1957.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=163–164}} Relocating to [[Branscombe]] in southern [[Devon]], he and Mina set up home in Hole House, a fortified building that dated to the Early Modern period,{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=164, 197}} and angered some of the locals by banning [[fox hunting|fox hunters]] from crossing his land.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=259}} Lethbridge came to believe that Hole House was haunted, describing unexplained noises and smells there; this increased his interest in the paranormal, and he decided to devote much of his time to investigating such phenomena in what he deemed to be a scientific manner.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=198–200}} Lethbridge believed that ghosts were [[Stone Tape|projections stored in rock]] and other material substances and which echoed particularly emotional or traumatic events that either happened in the past or will happen in the future.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=203}} He focused many of his experiments on [[dowsing]] using a [[pendulum]], coming to believe that the length of string used and the number of oscillations could be used to determine the type of object being detected.{{sfnm|1a1=Finneran|1y=2003|1p=110|2a1=Welbourn|2y=2011|2pp=208–212}}

His first book on the subject of what he often termed "the odd" was ''Ghost and Ghoul'', published in 1961 by Routledge and Kegan Paul.{{sfnm|1a1=Finneran|1y=2003|1p=110|2a1=Welbourn|2y=2011|2pp=213–222}}  In this work he argued that the [[mind]] was separate from the brain; he believed that the mind was connected to an ancestral collective mind which everyone inherited. Many of the ideas expressed in the work were akin to those of [[Carl Jung]], [[Richard Semon]], and [[Amy Warburg]], although it is not clear if Lethbridge had been aware of this beforehand.{{sfnm|1a1=Finneran|1y=2003|1p=110|2a1=Welbourn|2y=2011|2pp=213–222}} An extract was subsequently published in the January 1963 edition of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic Stories of Imagination]]''.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=229}} He followed this work with ''Witches – Investigating an Ancient Religion'' (1962), which articulated a form of Murray's [[witch-cult hypothesis]] but also contained many digressions and anecdotes unrelated to that topic.{{sfnm|1a1=Finneran|1y=2003|1p=110|2a1=Welbourn|2y=2011|2pp=223, 226}} Returning to the themes present in ''Ghost and Ghoul'', Lethbridge published ''Ghost and Divining Rod'' in 1963, in which he discussed his progress with his pendulum experiments.{{sfnm|1a1=Finneran|1y=2003|1p=110|2a1=Welbourn|2y=2011|2pp=231–233}} On the basis of this, the BBC filmed a short documentary titled ''Ghost Hunting with T.C. Lethbridge'' in May 1964, in which Lethbridge was filmed repeating his pendulum experiences in his garden.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=234–237}}

===Final years: 1965–71===

Lethbridge's next book was ''ESP – Beyond Time and Distance'', published in 1965. It dealt with the theme of [[extra-sensory perception]] and articulated Lethbridge's argument that rays of energy were transmitted from every object, and that they could be detected using pendulum dowsing.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=238–239}} In 1966 he published ''A Step in the Dark'', which repeated many of his theories regarding pendulum dowsing present in earlier works.{{sfnm|1a1=Finneran|1y=2003|1p=110|2a1=Welbourn|2y=2011|2p=242}} Early that year, Lethbridge first began struggling against [[heart disease]], an affliction that had resulted from his obesity.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=240}} In both his books and private letters from this period he regularly ranted against modern life and society, while in other correspondences with individuals in the United States he championed the authenticity of the [[Kensington Runestone]] and [[Westford Knight]].{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=244–258}}

In 1969, Lethbridge published ''The Monkey's Tail'', in which he discussed [[Darwinian]] evolution. Although agreeing that the evolution of species was an objective fact, he nevertheless argued that there was a blueprint for existence and that [[Genetic memory (biology)|genetic memory]] was a reality.{{sfnm|1a1=Finneran|1y=2003|1p=110|2a1=Welbourn|2y=2011|2pp=260–261}} In a sequel published in 1969, ''The Legend of the Sons of God – A Fantasy?'', Lethbridge argued that extraterrestrials had been responsible for aiding Earth's evolutionary development. Echoing many of the claims made by [[Erich von Däniken]] in ''[[Chariots of the Gods]]'' (1968), Lethbridge argued that the [[Stone circles in the British Isles and Brittany|late prehistoric stone circles of the British Isles]] had been beacons for extraterrestrial spacecraft.{{sfnm|1a1=Finneran|1y=2003|1p=110|2a1=Welbourn|2y=2011|2pp=267–271}} In this, his work has been cited as an anticipation of the [[Earth mysteries]] movement that expanded across Britain in the following decade.{{sfn|Finneran|2003|pp=109–110}}

Lethbridge's heart condition worsened, to the extent that he was unable to attend his mother's funeral in 1970.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=272}} He eventually required 24-hour care, and was transferred to [[Nuffield Hospital]] in [[Exeter]], where he died in his sleep on 30 September 1971.{{sfnm|1a1=Anonymous|1y=1972|1p=448|2a1=Welbourn|2y=2011|2p=274}} His body was interred at the family plot in [[Heytesbury]], Wiltshire.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=274}} As the Branscombe house was owned by the Lethbridge Family Trust, Mina was obliged to move out after her husband's death, and she sold his belongings out of financial necessity.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=275}} Mina also collected together Lethbridge's unfinished book with the help of writer [[Colin Wilson]]; together they assembled it into publishable form and it was brought out by Routledge in 1976 as ''The Power of the Pendulum''.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|pp=275–276}}

==Reception and legacy==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="The death of T. C. Lethbridge in the early autumn of last year took away from us a man who had been a colourful, stimulating, provocative and often controversial figure in British archaeology; a man who could very properly be described, in Cyrus Gordon’s phrase, as one who throughout his life kept an open mind and avoided confusing majority opinion with truth."|source=— Glyn Daniel, 1972.{{sfn|Daniel|1972|p=5}} }}

Archaeologist [[Niall Finneran]] asserted that Lethbridge had a "distinguished if fairly unspectacular reputation" within British archaeology prior to his adoption of fringe theories.{{sfn|Finneran|2003|p=108}} Various colleagues expressed critical praise of his work in this field; for instance, Lethbridge's fellow Anglo-Saxon archaeologist [[Audrey Meaney]] noted that his "observations on features in the cemeteries he excavated around Cambridge were perspicacious but in advance of his time".{{sfn|Meaney|1981|p=37}} Another Anglo-Saxon archaeologist, Sam Lucy, later noted that Lethbridge's observation that those buried with Anglo-Saxon material culture need not have been ethnically descended from continental migrants was &amp;ndash; while largely ignored by his contemporaries &amp;ndash; widely accepted in scholarship by the end of the 20th century.{{sfn|Lucy|2000|p=173}} However, his embrace of unorthodox and pseudo-scientific views later led to professional archaeologists becoming increasingly critical of his work; as his biographer Terry Welbourn noted, Lethbridge's peers came to view him as being "too radical&amp;nbsp;... a loose cannon and maverick".{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=13}}

On his death, [[Glyn Daniel]] described Lethbridge as "a colourful, stimulating, provocative and often controversial figure in British archaeology", who represented "one of the last of that invaluable band of dilettante scholars and devoted amateurs of whom we have had so many in Britain".{{sfn|Daniel|1972|p=5}} Although stating that Lethbridge only emerged as a "semi-professional" for a "short time", he praised much of Lethbridge's writing for its "freshness and an eager restless sense of enquiry".{{sfn|Daniel|1972|p=5}} An anonymously authored obituary in ''[[Society of Antiquaries of London|The Antiquaries Journal]]'' referred to "the strength and honesty of Lethbridge's character as a man, and the singleness of purpose that united all his work, as experimental testing of what he found by observation", seeing these as the unifying characteristics behind his divergent research interests.{{sfn|Anonymous|1972|p=449}} According to the historian [[Ronald Hutton]], as a result of both his unorthodox ideas and his "contempt for professionalism in all fields", Lethbridge's "status as a scholar never really rose above that of an unusually lively local antiquary".{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=274}} His books continue to be largely ignored by academics into the 21st century.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=16}}

Describing Lethbridge as "one of the most compelling" figures in 20th-century British archaeology,{{sfn|Finneran|2003|p=107}} Finneran believed that at the start of the 21st century, Lethbridge was best known for his advocacy of dowsing.{{sfn|Finneran|2003|p=107}} As such, Finneran asserted that Lethbridge's "true legacy" lay outside of "conventional archaeology", and could instead be located within the Earth mysteries movement.{{sfn|Finneran|2003|p=112}} Lethbridge's work continued to attract interest from parapsychologists after his death. The author  [[MB Devot|M.B. Devot]] drew heavily on Ghost and Ghoul in his ''Spirits of Field and Hearth''.&lt;ref name="ForteanTimes53"&gt;''Fortean Times'' No.53 ''MB Devot, A Life in the Hedgerow''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, the author [[Colin Wilson]] devoted part one of his book ''Mysteries'' to a discussion of Lethbridge's ideas.{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=276}} In 2003, a group of admirers of his work calling themselves "The Sons of T.C. Lethbridge" (Doggen Foster, Kevlar Bales and Welbourn Tekh), with the aid of Wilson and [[Julian Cope]], released ''A Giant: The Definitive T.C. Lethbridge'', a set comprising a booklet and two CDs containing music accompanying discussions of Lethbridge's work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian Cope|Cope, Julian]] (2003). "Bring It On!" in ''A Giant: The Definitive T.C. Lethbridge'' booklet. Lincoln: Aegir Recording Company.&lt;/ref&gt;
Welbourn subsequently published a biography of Lethbridge in 2011, titled ''T.C. Lethbridge: The Man who Saw the Future''; in it, he expressed his view that the archaeologist was "one of the most remarkable, yet overlooked men of the twentieth century".{{sfn|Welbourn|2011|p=13}}

'''Village deities''' are the [[Patron deity|patron deities]] or ''[[grama devata]]'' of village. They that do not belong to the [[vedic]] - [[Āgama (Hinduism)|Agamic]] [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of [[Hinduism]] are found in almost all villages throughout [[India]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] in particular. They are known as ''Kaval deivam'' or guardian spirits in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and ''Kula Daivam'' or Local Village Gods. They are associated to a main deity who is generally ascribed as Kuladeivam by various sects of community and clan groups as part of the tracing their generation through centuries.

==Shrine==
[[Image:Village shrine 1911.jpg|thumb|200px|A shrine to a village god in the [[Madras Presidency]], c.a. 1911]]
Most of these village deities have their shrines on the periphery (border or outskirts) of the village as a representation of their Village Guardian position. Hence they are referred as "Peripheral Folk Deity". 21 associate deities and 61 servant deities are located in either the same premises or located in different places of the locality, for e.g.: Amman deities may be installed in the centre of the village but the Sonai, Sudalai or the Formless [[Hero stone|Nadukkal]] deities may be installed close to [[graveyard]]s ([[cemeteries]] or burial and sometimes, also near memorial centres).

These Village deities are either represented in the form of a huge, fierce statue or as a simple stone. Most of these temples are not closed premises but are simple and small worship areas. Weapons such as a [[trident]] or a [[lance]] or [[sickle]]s are also associated with these shrines.

We also see lots of [[terracotta]] horses, [[elephant]]s, [[Golu|clay doll]]s and [[birds]] and bells (very similar to [[Indus Valley Culture|Indus Culture]]). Most officiating priests are pandarams and derive from the local ancestral lineages that had initiated the religious centres generations ago. In ancient times most of the City priests were pandarams.

The worship pattern is non-vedic through Folk tale, Folk Song and Folk arts ([[Villupattu]], [[Karakattam]], [[Koothhu]], etc.). The local priest might offer flowers or [[Vibhuthi]] (holy ash) or Holy flowers to the worshippers and may play the [[oracle]] role for [[shamanism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbmphoto.co.uk/India/gardian.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915100919/http://www.cbmphoto.co.uk/India/gardian.html |date=September 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Categories and folklores ==
The village deities in [[Tamil Nadu]] have interesting stories behind them. Mainly these village gods come under one of the three categories:
[[File:Terracotta horses, Sanskriti Museum.JPG|thumb|140px|Terracotta companions of [[Aiyanar]]. [[Sanskriti Museums]]]]

There are other various Natural energy worship in the form of  [[Muthaaramman]], [[Muthalamman]], [[Pachai Thanni Amman]], [[Pachaiyamman]], [[Pal Pazhakkari amman]], [[Solai amman]].

=== Hero stones and Sati stones ===

Hero stones (Nadukkal or Veerakkal) are the stones provided for the males who sacrifice their life for good causes. Sati stones are the stones provided for females who sacrificed their life for certain specific purpose, especially for chastity and purity.

This category includes people who lived and lost their lives for their community and hence their community members still remember them and worship them. This group also includes persons who were killed by injustice and hence were worshipped in order to save the village from their wrath. The worship for the fallen brave warriors is one of the popular forms of worship. The early Tamil poetry  '[[Tolkappiyam]]' gives an elaborate description in six stages in the planting of such a stone: beginning with looking for a suitable stone, until the institution of formal worship.

The portrait of the hero is often decorated with peacock feathers. Some poems refer to [[spear]]s and [[shield]]s erected around the planted stones. Offering of [[Naravam]] (toddy = alcohol) to the spirit of the fallen hero, represented in the planted stone, is mentioned in some verses. In time these “nadukals” became Ayyanar shrines. Other warrior gods include [[Madurai Veeran (Hinduism)|Madurai Veeran]] (who lived near Madurai), [[Kaathavarayan]] (who lived near Tanjavore) and [[Annammar swamigal]] (who lived near karur).

The "Thee paanch amman" temples in the northern part of [[Tamil Nadu]] were basically built to worship widows who were burnt along with their husbands' funeral pyre as part of the "Sathi" or "Saathi" or "[[Sati (practice)|Sati]]".

The “[[Maachani amman]]” temple at Polaachi was built to worship a young girl who was killed by a “[[Kongu (region)|Kongu]]” king since she unknowingly ate a [[mango]] from his garden.

The “[[Palayanoor Neeli]]” was a girl who was betrayed and cunningly killed by her husband and who took revenge by killing him in her next birth. Further, several love pairs who have lost their lives due to caste animosity are also being worshipped as village deities in several villages.

[[Seelakari amman]] in various parts of South Tamil Nadu and [[Kannagi]] worship are considered as a part of Sati stone worship system.  These goddess are most revered female deities for their purity and chastity as they are considered as the prime focus of the way of Tamil women.  Kanni amman and Pachai Amman are more common variants of female deities representing the characteristics of Purity and Chastity.

In general, Sati stones have not become part of the 21 sub-deities of Ayynar but at some places Seelakari amman is considered as part of 21 sub deities.  A more detailed research is required to identify clear clarity on various sub-deities including [[Isakki|Isakki Amman]], [[Sonai or Sonai Karuppu]] and others.

Any person who stood for justice and valiantly fought for justice or lost life for the cause of justice have become part of Hero Stone worship.  The more prominent are Pandian Nedunchezhian of Silappadhikaram fame,becoming Pandi Muneeswar along with the support of Samayakaruppu.  Madurai veeran and so many other stories run parallel to becoming Folk Deities worshipped by large following and becoming part of Kuladeivam.

=== Gods to tame evil and devil forces and converting to good powers ===
There were Forces or elements which the people were scared of.

[[Munishwaran]] or [[Muniappan]] in olden days was associated with protecting people, drinking devil's blood, doing good things, bringing in good-effect, etc.

[[Peichi amman]] (“Pei” means devil) also covered under this form.

== Legends from disastrous social events ==
These legends include social suppression stories such as [[Kannagi]], [[Nallathangal]] - out of which various worships were created to remind the people not to commit or repeat the same social mistakes of the past. [[wikt:purity|Purity]] and [[Chastity]] of women were given more reverence and prominence. [[Chitra Pournami (festival)|Chitra Pournami]] is celebrated grandly in memory of Sati women and Kannagi.  Nallathangal and similar stories represent the poor familial support leading to the [[suicide]] of womenfolk &amp; children.  These emphasize moral stories and not to repeat such mistakes again.

== Genesis of Mutual Assimilation and Diveristy-Preservation ==
[[File:Sri Aravan.jpg|thumb|[[Iravan|Aravan]] worshipped in [[Sri Mariamman Temple, Singapore]]]]

The third category contains certain less spoken characters in the great epics of [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. For example, there are many temples dedicated to [[Draupadi]] (Panchali) and Dharmaraja ([[Yudhishthira]]) in the Northern parts of Tamil Nadu. Temples dedicated [[Gandhari (character)|Gandhari]] (mother of the [[Kauravas]]), [[Kunti]] (mother of [[Pandavas]]) and [[Iravan|Aravan]] (the son of [[Arjuna]] and the serpent princess [[Ulupi]]) are found in Tamil Nadu.

The Vedic and non-Vedic poeople assimilated from each other. The Vedic Priests followed 'Let knowledge come from all directions of the universe' and the non-Vedic Priests followed 'everyone is our own people and every land is our own'. Even though there are diversified characteristics between the Vedic and the folk tradition, various communities inducted these deities in their spectrum; they created various sthalapuranas which emphasized the relation between these gods and goddesses from differing traditions. For example, a male deity called Kuttandavar is worshipped in many parts of the Tamil country, especially in South Arcot district. The image consists of a head like a big mask with a rubicund face and lion’s teeth projecting downwards outside the mouth from the angles of the upper jaw. According to legend the creation of Kuttandavar, the god of Indra, is for the crime of murdering a Vedic priest, became incarnated in the form of Kuttandavar, and a curse was laid upon him that his body leaving only the head. These types of stories need to be carefully examined, because they are regarded as the kuladevatas by the oppressed and downtrodden people. In these circumstances they also altered the structure of these deities into either elated or cursed form.

The popular deities have evolved significantly over time. For example, Mariamman, another deity of subalterns, is highly influenced by the Vedic rituals. She is usually garlanded with skulls. But recently, the skull garland has been replaced by the lemon garland. Her poor outlook has been altered into a pleasant one. Sometimes these restructuring processes led to the degradation of the deities. When they stress the holiness of the deities of Vedic tradition at the same time they denied the holiness of the deities of the folk tradition. They described the gods and goddesses of folk tradition either as watching deities to the deities of Vedic religion or they venertaed  these deities as capable of curing most potent contagious diseases.

The process of inclusivism can also be seen in the popular temples dedicated to the deities of folk religion. For example, the increase in the number of devotees to Samayapuram, Punnainallur, Vazhangaiman Mariamman temples in Tamil Nadu boosted the financial position. It attracts the Vedic priests to switch over their interest to Mariamman on account of the financial benefits. They not only dominate during the time of worship, but also on various other occasions. They have introduced the custom of Kumbhabhishekam. In addition to this, they have made Mariamman as a Suddhadevatas (non-vegetarian deity). With regard to the temples of folk tradition Vinayakar, Murugan, Iyyappan and others, Vedic deities are replaced by the deities of folk tradition such as [[Aiyanar]], [[Madurai Viran]] and [[Karuppannasamy]]. Even the people of the folk tradition have begun to follow some customs and habits of higher castes in order to raise their social status and that is eroding some of Hinduism's colossal Diversity.

== Typical temples for "Kaval Deivangal" ==
These deities are always found in the [[outskirt]]s of the village. The maintenance of the temple of these deities is taken care by the whole of the village. It is believed that these Gods shoo away all evils and devils from entering the village. Certain temples on the highway attracts vehicles on the road, there is a practice of visiting such places before undertaking a journey.

These temples are usually in the open space and will not have traditional [[Gopuram]]s like any other temples but in some villages like Sholanganallur and Puthur In Tiruchi district have Gopurams of their Kaval Deivangal for Kulumayee Amman and Ondi karuppannasamy. You can see big statues of Gods with weapons like [[bow and arrow]], [[sword]]s, [[knives]] and other protective [[weapons]]. There also will be statues of Goddesses, and animals in these temples.

== Festivals ==

During the recent decade or so the Jathara(Thiru Vizha in Tamizh or Festival in English) of Sammakka Saralamma the village deities in the Telangana has become very popular among the locals,which is now in fact the largest tribal festival in the world.Many Telugus and the neighbouring Marathis worship the village deities of Sammakka and Saralamma.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiamike.com/india/hyderabad-f139/andhra-pradesh-hosts-worlds-largest-tribal-festival-t100949/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sammakka Saralamma Jatara]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This shows the traces of worship of native Dravidian deities,not only in Tamil Nadu but also in Andhra Pradesh,Telangana and other south Indian states.

During the Tamil month of Masi and Panguni, Kulumayee Amman Festival is celebrated in Puthur and Sholnganallur villages in Tiruchi District of Tamil Nadu. During that time Marulali of the respective village suck the blood of the Goats with the blessings of Ondi Karuppu.
During the [[Tamil calendar|Tamil]] Months of [[Karthikai]] ([[Sokka Paanai]] during [[Karthigai Dheepam]]); Thai ([[Thai poosam]], [[Makar Jyothi]] of [[Ayyappan]]); Masi ([[Masi Kalari]] - [[Shivarathiri]]); [[Panguni]] ([[Panguni Uthiram]] considered as the auspicious birthday of [[Ayyanar]]); Aadi ([[Aadi Perukku]]) and [[Vaigasi]] ([[Vaigasi Visakam]]), festivals will be conducted in these temples. Generally, a mass convention assembly of large number of related family member gathering is organized during the [[Spring (season)|spring]] season for a period of 2 to 3 days. For the annual mass convention festival, the tradition is that the commencement of the festival will be with that of a hoisting of the flag and tying "[[Kappu]]." After this time, villagers neither can go out of the village to different village or come into the village from a different village.

Mayana Pujai is mostly practiced in midnight during the worship of Irulappasamy or Sadalaisamy.

Of special mention is that of the traditional "[[Theru Koothu]]" and “[[Villu Pattu]]”; it is a dance-drama (Koothu) enacted on the street (Theru).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tamilnadu.com/arts/therukoothu.html |title=Therukoothu |publisher=Tamilnadu.com |date=16 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130411213929/http://tamilnadu.com/arts/therukoothu.html |archivedate=April 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Koothu]] performers dance and recite songs/ narrations which often end with moral quotes. Through these kind of performances, the villagers are told what is good and what is bad; also the do's and don'ts.

Since the earlier days, these were the only means of media that took messages to the people.

People who always had greater belief in God agreed with the decisions that was taken by the committee members. More importantly, it is the belief of the village people that the [[Karuppu samy]] God is being disguised in the form of the man who predicts the future. This belief system about [[Karuppu samy]] is called the "[[Arul vaaku]]" in several parts of Tamil Nadu. The social issues will be discussed through the [[temple]] [[fore-teller]]s ([[Kodangi]]) whom the people usually consider as the voice of the [[Karuppa sami]] deity. When [[Lord Karuppa sami]] addresses the people in different villages through Kodangi, different issues and dimensions on social, cultural and psychological aspects of people and society are reviewed for possible solutions.

Worship of Goddess ANKAMMA: Ankamma is also known as Angamma, [[Ankalamma]], Angalamma, Ankali, Angali, Ankala Parameswari, Angala Parameswari. She is worshipped with these names in Andhra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu. Ankali and Kali are one and the same goddess. Ankamma is considered to be the mother of Trimurtis. The most important part of Ankamma Kolupu is that a midnight puja was performed with the help of ballads by making a colorful Rangoli with wheat flour, turmaric powder, kumkum, black charcoal powder, etc. At the end of the puja, the devotees sacrifice a goat. The devara kolupu / veerla kolupu is normally performed on some special occasions by individuals or by community as a whole. During the worship singers recite historical stories about warrior ancestors.

[[File:Песнь о вещем Олеге.jpg|thumb|[[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]] meets the volkhv. Painting by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]].]]
A '''volkhv''' or '''volhv''' ([[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]: Волхв; Polish: Wołchw, translatable as '''wiseman''', '''wizard''', '''magus''', i.e. '''[[shaman]]''', or '''[[magi|mage]]''') is a priest in ancient Slavic religions and contemporary [[Slavic Native Faith]] (Rodnovery). The term ''volkhv'' is a cognate of [[Old Norse]] ''[[völva]]''.

==In modern Rodnover priesthood==

In contemporary Slavic Native Faith, the volkhvs are those responsible for holding rites for worshipping the gods and leading communities and religious festivals. Volkhvs are the higher rank of the sacerdotal hierarchy, the lesser order being that of the ''zhrets''.{{sfn|Pilkington|Popov|2009|p=272, note 11}} The latter are not necessarily shamans, and their function is merely to hold [[sacrifice]]s (the word ''zhrets'' literally means "sacrificer", from [[Proto-Slavic]] *''žьrti'', and is cognate of Slavic words for "offering").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gieysztor |first=Aleksander |author-link=Aleksander Gieysztor |year=2006 |title=Mitologia Słowian |publisher=Warsaw University Press |location=Warsaw |isbn=832350234X}} p. 210; {{cite book |last=Urbańczyk |first=Stanisław |author-link=Stanisław Urbańczyk |year=1968 |title=Szkice z dziejów języka polskiego |publisher=[[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN]] |location=Warsaw |isbn=832350234X}} p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the majority of Rodnover priests are males, Rodnover groups do not exclude women from the priesthood, so that a parallel female priesthood is constituted by the two ranks of ''zhritsa'' and ''vedunya'' ("seeresses"). Prestige is not limited to male priests; a priestess, Halyna Lozko from Ukraine, is an acknowledged authority within the Rodnover movement.{{sfn|Aitamurto|2008|p=4}}

In 2012, three Russian Rodnover organisations, the Union of Slavic Rodnover Communities, the Circle of the Pagan Tradition and the Circle of Veles, signed an "Agreement on Mutual Recognition of Priests", instituting a common priesthood and the criteria for the ordination of those wishing to become Slavic priests.{{sfn|Skrylnikov|2016}}

==Among the olden Rus'==
Volkhvs are attested among the early [[Rus' people]]. Volkhvs were believed to possess mystical powers, particularly the ability to predict the future. The first literary reference to a volkhv occurs in the [[Primary Chronicle]] under the year 912; there, the priest-soothsayer predicts [[Oleg of Novgorod|Prince Oleg]]'s death. With the adoption of Christianity, the pagan priests came under persecution and sometimes tried to channel social discontent against the Christian church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Volkhv |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine|Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine]] |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\V\O\VolkhvIT.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303185039/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages\V\O\VolkhvIT.htm |archive-date=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waḥy''' ({{lang-ar|وحي}}, {{IPA-ar|waħj|IPA}}; also spelled '''wahi''') is the Arabic word for '''[[revelation]]''' or inspiration. In Islamic belief, revelations are [[God in Islam|God]]'s Word delivered by his chosen individuals – known as [[Apostle (Islam)|Messenger prophets]] – to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Juan E. Campo |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam |publisher=[[Facts On File]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8160-5454-1|page=589}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islam]], the [[Quran]] is considered a wahy given to the Islamic prophet, [[Muhammad]]. The word ''awha'' ({{lang|ar|أوحى}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|awḥá}}'') occurs in a number of shades of meaning in the Quran, each of them indicating the main underlying idea of directing or guiding someone or something. For example,  "And inspired in each heaven its command," (Fussilat-12). "And your lord inspired to the bee," (An Nahl-68). "And we inspired to the mother of Mosses," (Al Qasas-7). Islamic scholars say that there is a clear difference between these kind of "wahy "and "wahy" to the Messenger Prophet. The prophets were very much conscious about revelations and they firmly believed that the revelations were true and came from the Almighty God. The word "wahy" (revelation) is derived from ''awha''.

== Description==
In Islamic tradition, the {{cite quran|42|51|s=ns|b=n}} verse of the [[Quran]] serves as the basis of understanding for ''wahy''. It says "''It is not fitting for a man that Allah should speak to him except by inspiration, or from behind a veil, or by the sending of a messenger to reveal, with Allah's permission, what Allah wills''". Based on this, Islamic scholars have described three ways in which [[God in Islam|God]]'s revelation can reach His chosen individuals, especially prophets.&lt;ref name="MQ"&gt;Muhammad Shafi Usmani, ''[[Maariful Quran]]'', see commentary on 42:51&lt;/ref&gt;  An inspired message – not a word but an idea – can enter the heart of the chosen individuals either in the state of consciousness or in dream.&lt;ref name="Ali70"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ali |first=Muhammad |authorlink=Muhammad Ali (writer) |title=The Religion of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=etnEKz_rOfgC&amp;pg=PT70 |accessdate= |year=1936 |publisher= |location=[[Lahore]] |isbn= |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second mode, it is said, is the word heard by the person spoken to, like, from behind a veil.&lt;ref name="Ali70"/&gt; In the third mode, the revelation is sent from God through archangels like [[Gabriel]] and is delivered to the prophets. It is the highest form of revelation, and [[Muslim]]s believe the whole Quran was revealed in this mode.&lt;ref name="MQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ali70"/&gt;

==Purpose==
According to [[Islamic scholar]] [[Muhammad Shafi Usmani]], [[God in Islam|God]] has created three media through which humans receive knowledge: [[Sense|men’s senses]], [[Reason|the faculty of reason]], and the divine revelation; and it is the third one that addresses the liturgical and eschatological issues, answers the questions regarding God's purpose behind creating mankind, and acts as a guidance for the mankind as to choosing the correct way.&lt;ref name="MQIntro"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Introduction |title=[[Maariful Quran]] |chapter-url=http://www.islamibayanaat.com/MQ/English-MaarifulQuran-MuftiShafiUsmaniRA-Vol-1-IntroHistoryAndPage-0-28.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Islamic belief, the sequence of divine revelation came to an end with Muhammad.&lt;ref name="MQIntro"/&gt;

==Mode of descent==
As regard to revelation received by [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]], Muslim sources mention various modes in which they believe revelation came to him. Muslim scholar [[Muhammad Shafi Usmani]] has summarized five modes of descent. The common mode was that Muhammad would hear sound like "the ringing of a bell" after which he found the message committed to his memory. Sometimes, the arch angel would come in human shape, most often of Dahya al-Kalbi. In two cases, Gabriel appeared in his real form. Once, on the night of [[Isra and Mi'raj|Miraj]], Muhammad is believed to have had a direct conversation with God.  In the fifth mode, Gabriel would let the revelation enter into Muhammad’s heart.&lt;ref name="MQIntro"/&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2015}}

== Scholarly views ==
[[Annemarie Schimmel]] states that most recent studies of Muhammad indicate that Muhammad devoutly believed that he was God's instrument.{{fact|date=June 2017}} [[William Montgomery Watt]] argues that only Muhammad's sincerity can explain his "readiness to endure hardship and persecution during the Meccan period when from a secular point of view there was no prospect of success.&lt;ref name="Watt"/&gt; To carry on in the face of persecution and hostility would have been impossible for him unless he was fully persuaded that God had sent him.&lt;ref name="Watt1"&gt;Watt, Muhammad the prophet and the statesman, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; "

[[William Montgomery Watt]] presents the following possibilities for the sources of Qur'an:&lt;ref name="CambH"&gt;Cambridge History of Islam, p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Sometimes he [Muhammad] may have heard the words being spoken to him, but for most part he seems simply to have "found them in his heart". Whatever the precise "manner of revelation"-and several different 'manners' were listed by Muslim scholars- the important point is that the message was not the product of Muhammad's conscious mind. He believed he could easily distinguish between his own thinking and these revelations. His sincerity in this belief must be accepted by the modern historian, for this alone makes credible the development of a great religion. The further question, however, whether the messages came from Muhammad's unconscious, or the collective unconscious functioning in him, or from some divine source, is beyond the competence of the historian.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to historian Welch, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The really powerful factor in Muhammad's life and the essential clue to his extraordinary success was his unshakable belief from beginning to end that he had been called by God. A conviction such as this, which, once firmly established, does not admit of the slightest doubt, exercises an incalculable influence on others. The certainty with which he came forward as the executor of God's will gave his words and ordinances an authority that proved finally compelling.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Islam, Muhammad&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A number of Western historians have addressed the question of whether Muhammad was sincere when he reported receiving revelations. Around a hundred years ago, [[Thomas Carlyle]] in his lectures, "On Heroes", vigorously defended Muhammad arguing that one can only accuse him of insincerity if one fails to understand Islam and its worldwide success.&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;Watt, Muhammad the prophet and the statesman, p.232&lt;/ref&gt; Carlyle's  view has been increasingly influential ever since and contemporary historians tend to say that as far as can be ascertained Muhammad did believe that he was hearing the word of God.&lt;ref name="CambH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie Schimmel, Mystische Dimensionen des Islam, München, 1995, pp.51-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Watt notes, "To say that Muhammad was sincere does not imply that he was correct in his beliefs. A man maybe sincere but mistaken. The modern Westerner has not difficulty in showing how Muhammad may have been mistaken. What seems to a man to come from 'outside himself' may actually come from his unconscious."&lt;ref&gt;Watt, Muhammad Prophet and Statesman, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yamdrok Lake''' (also known as '''Yamdrok Yumtso''' or '''Yamzho Yumco'''; {{bo|t=ཡར་འབྲོག་གཡུ་མཚོ་|w=yar-'drog. G’yu-mtsho|z=Yamzhog Yumco}}; {{zh|c=羊卓雍錯|p=Yángzhuō Yōngcuò}}) is a freshwater lake in [[Tibet]], it is one of the three largest sacred [[lake]]s in [[Tibet]]. It is over {{convert|72|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. The lake is surrounded by many snow-capped mountains and is fed by numerous small streams. The lake has an outlet stream at its far western end and means turquoise in English due to its color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.onceinalifetimejourney.com/once-in-a-lifetime-journeys/guide-tibet/|title=Guide to Tibet - Things to do, Places to visit and Practicalities|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 90&amp;nbsp;km to the west of the lake lies the Tibetan town of [[Gyantse]] and [[Lhasa]] is a hundred km to the northeast. According to local [[mythology]], Yamdok Yumtso lake is the transformation of a goddess.

The [[Yamdrok Hydropower Station]] was completed and dedicated in 1996 near the small village of [[Baidi (village)|Baidi]] at the lake’s western end. This power station is the largest in Tibet.&lt;ref name=Seibert&gt;{{Cite web

==Physical data==
The lake (638&amp;nbsp;km² in area, 30 meters average depth and 60 meters at its deepest) is fan-shaped, spreading to the south but narrowing up to the north. The mountainous lakeshore is highly crenellated, with numerous bays and inlets. Lake Yamdrok freezes in winter.

==Climate==
Yamdrok Lake has a cold [[steppe climate]] (''BSk'') with long, cold, very dry winters and short, cool, wet summers. It is also bordering on an alpine [[tundra climate]] (''ET'') and on a [[subarctic climate]] (''Dwc''). The differences between day and night are great.

==Cultural significance==
Like mountains, lakes are considered sacred by Tibetan people, the principle being that they are the dwelling places of protective deities and therefore invested with special spiritual powers. Yamdrok Lake is one of four particularly holy lakes, thought to be divinatory; everyone from the Dalai Lama to local villagers makes pilgrimages there.  It is considered sacred as one of the four "Great Wrathful Lakes" guarded by the goddess Dorje Gegkyi Tso.&lt;ref name=Seibert/&gt;  The others such lakes are [[Lhamo La-tso]], [[Namtso]] and [[Manasarovar]]. The lake is revered as a talisman and is said to be part of the life-spirit of Tibet. The largest lake in southern Tibet, it is said that if its waters dry, Tibet will no longer be habitable.

The lake, its islands, and the surrounding area are closely associated with [[Padmasambhava]], the Second Buddha, who brought Buddhism to Tibet in 8th century AD.&lt;ref name=Seibert/&gt;  The lake is home to the famous [[Samding Monastery]] which is on a peninsula jutting into the lake. This monastery is the only Tibetan monastery to be headed by a female re-incarnation. Since it is not a nunnery, its female abbot heads a community of about thirty monks and nuns. Samding Monastery is where [[Samding Dorje Phagmo]], the most important female incarnate [[Lama]] in Tibet, stayed and presided, and stands to the south of Lake Yamdrok Yumtso.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsgd.com/specials/traveltibet/tibetlake/200609180029.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, both pilgrims and tourists can be seen walking along the lake's perimeter. One of the lake's islands contains an old fort or castle called Pede Dzong.

==Economic significance==
There are shoals of fish living in Yamdrok Lake, which are commercially exploited by local population. From April to October, fish caught from this lake are sold at markets in [[Lhasa]], Tibet's capital.

Additionally, the lake's islands serve as rich pasture land to local herdsmen.
