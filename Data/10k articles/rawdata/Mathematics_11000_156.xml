'''Ada K. Dietz''' (June 16, 1882 - May 13, 1950) was an American [[weaving|weaver]] best known for her 1949 monograph ''Algebraic Expressions in Handwoven Textiles'', which defines a novel method for generating weaving patterns based on algebraic patterns. Her method employs the expansion of multivariate [[polynomial]]s to devise a weaving scheme. Dietz' work is still well-regarded today, by both weavers and mathematicians. Along with the references listed below, Griswold (2001) cites several additional articles on her work.

==History==

Ada Dietz developed her algebraic method in 1946 while living in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[California]].  An avid weaver, Dietz drew upon her experience as a former math teacher to devise a threading pattern based on a cubic binomial expansion.  She describes her idea as follows:

:"Taking the cube of a binomial &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt; (''x'' + ''y'')&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, I approached &lt;nowiki&gt;[the pattern]&lt;/nowiki&gt; in the way applied algebraic problems are approached - by letting ''x'' equal one unknown and ''y'' equal the other unknown.

:"In this case, ''x'' equaled the first and second harnesses, and ''y'' equaled the third and fourth harnesses.  Then it was simply a matter of expanding the cube of the binomial and substituting the values of ''x'' and ''y'' to write the threading draft." (Dietz, 1949)

A piece based on the formula (''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' + ''d'' + ''e'' + ''f'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, submitted to the Little Loomhouse Country Fair in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]] received such a positive response, which prompted a collaboration between Dietz and Little Loomhouse's founder, Lou Tate.  The fruits of the collaboration included the booklet ''Algebraic Expressions in Handwoven Textiles'' and a traveling exhibit which continued throughout the 1950s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1056">The '''adjusted current yield''' is a [[finance|financial]] term used in reference to [[bond (finance)|bond]]s and other [[securities|fixed-interest securities]]. It is closely related to the concept of [[current yield]].

The adjusted current yield is given by the current yield with addition of 
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{ (\text{Face value}- \text{Clean price})/ \text{Years to maturity} }{\text{Clean price}}\cdot 100\%.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''Face value'' is the [[face value]] of the bond, and ''Clean price'' is the [[clean price]] of the bond (i.e. [[present value]] of the bond with [[accrued interest]] subtracted).

== Formula for adjusted current yield ==

In total the ''adjusted current yield'' is given by
&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\text{Annual coupon payments}}{\text{Clean price}}\cdot 100\% + \frac{ (\text{Face value}- \text{Clean price})/ \text{Years to maturity} }{\text{Clean price}}\cdot 100\%.

'''Alexandru T. Balaban''' (born April 2, 1931) is a chemist who significantly contributed  to the fields of [[organic chemistry]], [[theoretical chemistry]], [[mathematical chemistry]], and [[chemical graph theory]].

== Early life and education ==
Balaban was born in [[Reșița]], in the western part of [[Romania]], close to [[Timișoara]]. His parents (Teodor and Florica Balaban) paid a lot of attention to Balaban's education, strongly encouraging his fascination with chemistry. In 1935 his family moved to [[Bucharest]], where Balaban attended elementary school. After [[World War II]], in 1945 they moved to [[Petroșani]], where he finished high school. Alexandru Balaban enrolled the [[Politehnica University of Bucharest]] in 1949, where he was awarded a [[Ph.D.]] in chemistry on April 2, 1959.  The topic of his Ph.D. thesis dealt with the restrictions catalyzed by anhydrous [[aluminium chloride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balaban|first=Alexandru|date=March 24, 2016|title=Autobiographical notes - 80 years of age, 68 years of chemistry|url=http://match.pmf.kg.ac.rs/electronic_versions/Match66/n1/match66n1_7-32.pdf|journal=MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem.|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
For more than forty years, professor Balaban held positions at the Chair of Organic Chemistry of the  [[Politehnica University of Bucharest]]  ([[assistant professor]] (1956-1960), [[associate professor]] (1961-1966) and [[Professor|full professor]] (1970-1999)). In addition, he was the head of the Laboratory of Isotopically Labelled Compounds of the Bucharest Institute of Atomic Physics from 1967 to 1974.

From 1967 to 1970, he was appointed as a Senior Research Officer at the Chemistry Division, International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, Austria, in charge with radiopharmaceuticals.  From 1995 to 1998, he was acting as Vicepresident of the [[Romanian Academy]].  From 1991 to 2012, he was a tenured professor of chemistry at [[Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston]]. Since 2013, after his retirement, he has continued as Professor Emeritus at this university.

== Research ==

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tamug.edu/mars/Faculty%20Biographies/AlexandruTBalaban.html|title=Alexandru T. Balaban - TAMUG|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston|access-date=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== [[Organic chemistry|Experimental organic chemistry]] ==
Professor Balaban has been investigating the synthesis and properties of [[pyrylium salt]]s. He discovered with co-workers a new way of synthesis of pyrylium salts by diacylation of [[alkene]]s. This reaction is known as  Balaban-Nenitzescu-Praill reaction. Nowadays, Balaban is recognized as a world authority in this field. He wrote the only existing book in this area.

Balaban also developed new synthesis of oxazoles by [[Aluminium chloride|AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] catalyzed substitution of aromatic compounds with  [[Azlactone synthesis|azlactones]], followed by dehidratation. In addition, he had been exploring new syntheses of [[indolizine]]s and of [[naphthalene]] derivatives.

In order to explain the extraordinary stability of hydrazyls such as [[DPPH|2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl]], Professor Balaban and his co-workers prepared related hydrazyls with lower [[Steric effects|steric shielding]] and accordingly lower stability. Then the first push-pull diarylaminyls were synthesized and shown to have stabilities depending both on electronic and [[steric effects]].

Another experimental research direction involves the synthesis of [[Chelation|chelate]] compounds having [[boron]] as the central atom.

== [[Theoretical chemistry]] ==
Professor Balaban had a permanent interest in [[theoretical chemistry]]. He is considered as one of pioneers of the [[Chemical graph theory|Chemical Graph Theory]].

The first book about this interdisciplinary field was edited by Dr. Balaban and appeared in 1976: ''Chemical Applications of Graph Theory'' (Academic Press, London) and its Chinese translation in 1983.

One area in which cubic (or trivalent) graphs play a dominant role is the enumeration of [''n'']annulene valence isomers (CH)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; where ''n'' is an even number. With two coauthors, Dr. Balaban published in 1986 on this topic a 3-volume monograph (''Annulenes, Benzo-, Hetero-, Homo-Derivatives and Their Valence Isomers'', CRC Press). Some of these valence isomers undergo thermal or pohotochemical automerizations. More recently, Dr. Balaban edited in 1997 a book titled ''From Chemical Topology to Three-Dimensional Geometry'', Plenum Publishing Corporation, in which various two- and three-dimensional nets were discussed.

On using an approach similar to that imagined by [[Randić's molecular connectivity index|Randić for his connectivity index χ]], but replacing the [[adjacency matrix]] by the [[distance matrix]], and compensating graph-size-increase, a new [[topological index]] (TI) ''J'' was proposed under the name "average distance-based connectivity index"; it is now known as the "Balaban index". Not only is it much less degenerate than all previous TIs, but it allows a simple encoding for the presence of [[multiple bond]]s or [[heteroatom]]s. Other new TIs were studied: several TIs based on informational descriptors, and triplet-based indices that result from converting [[matrix (chemical analysis)|matrices]] into systems of [[linear equation]]s.

The [[Lewis acid catalysis|Lewis acid-catalyzed]] syntheses of diamondoid hydrocarbons discovered by Schleyer proceed via multiple [[1,2-rearrangement]]s. The graph-theoretical analysis of the simplest such reaction involves an ethyl cation with five substituents which undergoes an automerization. This process is characterized by a 20-vertex or a 10-vertex graph depending whether one carbon atom of ethane is or is not labeled. These graphs constitute the first ''reaction graphs'', in which vertices symbolize reaction intermediates and edges symbolize elementary reaction steeps.

== [[Graph theory]] ==
Starting from the 10-vertex graph known as the 5-cage or the [[Petersen graph]], Dr. Balaban observed relations among the known cages. Having discovered how a cage with smaller [[Girth (graph theory)|girth]] ''g'' was hidden in a cage with girth ''g'' + 1, Dr. Balaban published a paper on what was later proved to be the first 10-cage, known as the [[Balaban 10-cage]]. In 1973, he found the unique 11-cage, known as the [[Balaban 11-cage]], as was proved by mathematicians using a lengthy computer search.

Proposals made by Balaban about new possibilities for evaluating the performance of researchers, improving the way citations are used for this purpose (e. g., via the [[H-index|Hirsch index]]) included the use of author indexes of widely circulated treatises, or modifying the way one considers the impact factors of journals.

Honoring invitations to contribute to special issues of journals dedicated to the philosophy of chemistry, Dr. Balaban published in ''Hyle'' an essay on how the "Sherlock Holmes principle" (if one eliminates the impossible, then whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must contain the truth) can be implemented by [[chemical graph theory]] which allows for instance to find all [[chemical isomer]]s for a given formula.

== Scientific publications ==
''Books'' (17): author or co-author for 9 books including: ''Pyrylium Salts. Syntheses, Reactions and Physical Properties'', Academic Press,1982; ''Annulenes, Benzo-, Hetero-, Homo-Derivatives and Their Valence Isomers'', 3 volumes, CRC Press, 1986; ''Modeling of Cancer Genesis and Prevention'', CRC Press,1990; editor or co-editor of 8 books including: ''Chemical Applications of Graph Theory,'' Academic Press, 1974 translated into Chinese in 1983''; From Chemical Topology to Three-Dimensional Geometry'', Plenum Press,1997; ''Science and Technology Management,'' NATO Science Series, 1987''; Topological Indices and Related Descriptors in QSAR and QSPR,'' Gordon and Breach, 1999.

''Chapters in books edited by other authors'' (80).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2515">An '''amenable number''' is a positive [[integer]] for which there exists a [[multiset]] of as many integers as the original number that both add up to the original number and when multiplied together give the original number. To put it algebraically, for a positive integer ''n'', there is a multiset of ''n'' integers {a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;}, for which the equalities

&lt;math&gt;n = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i = \prod_{i=1}^n a_i&lt;/math&gt;

hold. Negative numbers are allowed in the multiset. For example, 5 is amenable since 5 = 1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) + 5. All and only those numbers congruent to 0 or 1 (mod 4), except 4, are amenable. {{harv|Tamvakis|Lossers|1998}}

The first few amenable numbers are: 1, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13 ... {{OEIS2C|A100832}}

A solution for integers of the form ''n'' = 4''k'' + 1 could be given by a set of 2''k'' (+1)s and 2''k'' (-1)s and ''n'' itself. (This generalizes the example of 5 given above.)

Although not obvious from the definition, the set of amenable numbers is closed under multiplication (the product of two amenable numbers is an amenable number). 

All [[composite number]]s would be amenable if the multiset was allowed to be of any length, because, even if other solutions are available, one can always obtain a solution by taking the prime factorization (expressed with repeated factors rather than exponents) and add as many 1s as necessary to add up to ''n''. The product of this set of integers will yield ''n'' no matter how many 1s there are in the set. Furthermore, still under this assumption, any integer ''n'' would be amenable. Consider the inelegant solution for ''n'' of {{nowrap|1={1, -1, 1, -1, ''n''}}}. In the sum, the positive ones are cancelled out by the negative ones, leaving ''n'', while in the product, the two negative ones cancel out the effect of their signs.

Amenable numbers should not be confused with [[amicable number]]s, which are pairs of integers whose divisors add up to each other.

{{refimprove|date=July 2014}}
An '''and-inverter graph (AIG)''' is a directed, acyclic [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] that represents a structural implementation of the logical functionality of a [[digital circuit|circuit or network]].  An AIG consists of two-input nodes representing [[logical conjunction]], terminal nodes labeled with variable names, and edges optionally containing markers indicating [[logical negation]].  This representation of a logic function is rarely structurally efficient for large circuits, but is an efficient representation for manipulation of [[boolean function]]s. Typically, the abstract graph is represented as a [[data structure]] in software.
[[Image:And-inverter-graph.svg|thumb|400px|Two structurally different AIGs for the function f(x1, x2, x3) = x2 * ( x1 + x3 )]]

Conversion from the network of [[logic gate]]s to AIGs is fast and scalable. It only requires that every gate be expressed in terms of [[AND gate]]s and [[inverter (logic gate)|inverters]]. This conversion does not lead to unpredictable increase in memory use and runtime.  This makes the AIG an efficient representation in comparison with either the [[binary decision diagram]] (BDD) or the "sum-of-product" (ΣoΠ) form,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} that is, the [[canonical form (Boolean algebra)|canonical form]] in [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] known as the [[disjunctive normal form]] (DNF). The BDD and DNF may also be viewed as circuits, but they involve formal constraints that deprive them of scalability.  For example, ΣoΠs are circuits with at most two levels while BDDs are canonical, that is, they require that input variables be evaluated in the same order on all paths.

Circuits composed of simple gates, including AIGs, are an "ancient" research topic. The interest in AIGs started with Alan Turing's seminal 1948 paper&lt;ref&gt;Turing's 1948 paper has been re-printed as Turing AM. Intelligent Machinery. In: Ince DC, editor. ''Collected works of AM Turing &amp;mdash; Mechanical Intelligence.'' Elsevier Science Publishers, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; on neural networks, in which he described a randomized trainable network of NAND gates.   Interest continued through the late 1950s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =L. Hellerman|title=A catalog of three-variable Or-Inverter and And-Inverter logical circuits|journal=IEEE Trans. Electron. Comput.|volume=EC-12|date=June 1963|pages=198&amp;ndash;223|doi=10.1109/PGEC.1963.263531|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued in the 1970s when various local transformations have been developed.  These transformations were implemented in several
logic synthesis and verification systems, such as Darringer et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Darringer |author2=W. H. Joyner, Jr. |author3=C. L. Berman |author4=L.

Several important techniques were discovered early at [[IBM]], such as combining and reusing multi-input logic expressions and subexpressions, now known as [[structural hashing]].

Recently there has been a renewed interest in AIGs as a [[Functional Representation|functional representation]] for a variety of tasks in synthesis and verification. That is because representations popular in the 1990s (such as BDDs) have reached their limits of scalability in many of their applications.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Another important development was the recent emergence of much more efficient [[boolean satisfiability]] (SAT) solvers. When coupled with ''AIGs'' as the circuit representation, they lead to remarkable speedups in solving a wide variety of [[boolean problem]]s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

AIGs found successful use in diverse [[Electronic design automation|EDA]] applications. A well-tuned combination of ''AIGs'' and [[boolean satisfiability]] made an impact on [[formal verification]], including both [[model checking]] and equivalence checking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A.

ICCAD '04|pages=42&amp;ndash;49|date=2004|url=http://www.perbjesse.com/iccad04.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a growing understanding that logic and physical synthesis problems can be solved using simulation and [[boolean satisfiability]] to compute functional properties (such as symmetries)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=K.-H.

ICCAD | pages=254&amp;mdash;261 | date=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mishchenko et al. shows that AIGs are a promising ''unifying'' representation, which can bridge [[logic synthesis]], [[technology mapping]], physical synthesis, and formal verification.  This is, to a large extent, due to the simple and uniform structure of AIGs, which allow rewriting, simulation, mapping, placement, and verification to share the same data structure.

In addition to combinational logic, AIGs have also been applied to [[sequential logic]] and sequential transformations.  Specifically, the method of structural hashing was extended to work for AIGs with memory elements (such as [[flip-flop (electronics)#D flip-flop|D-type flip-flop]]s with an initial state,
which, in general, can be unknown) resulting in a data structure that is specifically tailored for applications related to [[retiming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=J. Baumgartner |author2=A. Kuehlmann |title=Min-area retiming on flexible circuit structures|booktitle= Proc. ICCAD'01|pages=176&amp;ndash;182|date=2001|url=ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/es/info/iwls01_ret.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing research includes implementing a modern logic synthesis system completely based on AIGs.  The prototype called [http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/ ABC] features an AIG package, several AIG-based synthesis and equivalence-checking techniques, as well as an experimental implementation of sequential synthesis. One such technique combines technology mapping and retiming in a single optimization step. These optimizations can be implemented using networks composed of arbitrary gates, but the use of AIGs makes them more scalable and easier to implement.

'''Applied Maths''' NV is a [[bioinformatics]] company, headquartered in [[Sint-Martens-Latem]], [[Belgium]], developing software for the biosciences.

==History==

Applied Maths was founded in 1992 and gained worldwide recognition with the software GelCompar, used as a standard tool for the normalization and comparative analysis of [[electrophoresis]] patterns ([[PFGE]], [[Amplified fragment length polymorphism|AFLP]], [[RAPD]], REP-PCR and variants, …)
&lt;ref&gt;Dijkshoorn L., Towner K. J., Struelens M., 2001. New approaches for the generation and analysis of microbial typing data. Elsevier, {{ISBN|0-444-50740-X}}, {{ISBN|978-0-444-50740-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

GelCompar II was released in 1998 to deal with the ever growing amounts of information following the success and expansion of electrophoresis and other fingerprinting techniques in various application fields in [[microbiology]], [[virology]] and [[mycology]]. Following the introduction of the concepts of polyphasic taxonomy &lt;ref&gt;[http://mmbr.asm.org/content/60/2/407.full.pdf+html] Vandamme et al., Polyphasic taxonomy, a consensus approach to bacterial systematics. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. June 1996 vol. 60 no. 2 407-438.&lt;/ref&gt; and the growing need to combine [[genotypic]], [[phenotypic]], electrophoresis and sequence information, Applied Maths released in 1996 the software package [[BioNumerics]] which still today is a platform for the management, storage and (statistical) analysis of all types of biological data.&lt;ref&gt;Vauterin L, Vauterin P.

'''Authenticated Identity Body''' or '''AIB''' is a method allowing parties in a [[Telecommunications network|network]] to share authenticated identity thereby increasing the integrity of their [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]] communications. AIBs extend other authentication methods like S/MIME to provide a more specific mechanism to introduce integrity to SIP transmissions. Parties transmitting AIBs [[cryptograph]]ically sign a subset of SIP message headers, and such signatures assert the message originator's identity. To meet requirements of reference integrity (for example in defending against replay attacks) additional SIP message headers such as 'Date' and 'Contact' may be optionally included in the AIB.

AIB is described and discussed in RFC 3893: ''"For reasons of end-to-end privacy, it may also be desirable to encrypt AIBs [...]. While encryption of AIBs entails that only the holder of a specific key can decrypt the body, that single key could be distributed throughout a network of hosts that exist under common policies. The security of the AIB is therefore predicated on the secure distribution of the key. However, for some networks (in which there are [[federation]]s of trusted hosts under a common [[policy]]), the widespread distribution of a [[Key (cryptography)|decryption key]] could be appropriate. Some [[telephone]] networks, for example, might require this model. When an AIB is encrypted, the AIB should be encrypted before it is signed... Unless, of course, it is signed by Mrs. L in Rin, VA."''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1853">In [[functional analysis]], a branch of mathematics, a '''Beppo Levi space''', named after [[Beppo Levi]], is a certain space of [[generalized function]]s.

In the following, {{mvar|D′}} is the space of [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]], {{mvar|S′}} is the space of [[tempered distributions]] in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{mvar|D&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;}} the differentiation operator with {{mvar|α}} a multi-index, and &lt;math&gt;\widehat{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Fourier transform]] of {{mvar|v}}.

The Beppo Levi space is

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{W}^{r,p} = \left \{v \in D' \ : \ |v|_{r,p,\Omega} &lt; \infty \right \},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|{{!}}⋅{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;''r'',''p''&lt;/sub&gt;}} denotes the [[Sobolev space|Sobolev]] semi-norm.

An alternative definition is as follows: let {{math|''m'' ∈ '''N''', ''s'' ∈ '''R'''}} such that

: &lt;math&gt;-m + \tfrac{n}{2} &lt; s &lt; \tfrac{n}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and define:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H^s &amp;= \left \{ v \in S' \ : \ \widehat{v} \in L^1_\text{loc}(\mathbf{R}^n), \int_{\mathbf{R}^n} |\xi|^{2s}| \widehat{v} (\xi)|^2 \, d\xi &lt; \infty \right \} \\ [6pt]
X^{m,s} &amp;= \left \{ v \in D' \ : \ \forall \alpha \in \mathbf{N}^n, |\alpha| = m, D^{\alpha} v \in H^s \right \} \\ 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Then {{math|''X''&lt;sup&gt;''m'',''s''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the Beppo-Levi space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6323">In [[mathematics]], '''Bäcklund transforms''' or '''Bäcklund transformations''' (named after the Swedish mathematician [[Albert Victor Bäcklund]]) relate [[partial differential equation]]s and their solutions. They are an important tool in [[soliton theory]] and [[integrable system]]s. A Bäcklund transform is typically a system of first order partial differential equations relating two functions, and often depending on an additional parameter. It implies that the two functions separately satisfy partial differential equations, and each of the two functions is then said to be a Bäcklund transformation of the other.

A Bäcklund transform which relates solutions of the ''same'' equation is called an '''invariant Bäcklund transform''' or '''auto-Bäcklund transform'''.  If such a transform can be found, much can be deduced about the solutions of the equation especially if the Bäcklund transform contains a parameter. However, no systematic way of finding Bäcklund transforms is known.

== History ==
[[File:Pseudosphere.png|thumb|Bäcklund transforms originated as transformations of [[pseudosphere]]s in the 1880s.]]
Bäcklund transforms have their origins in [[differential geometry]]: the first nontrivial example is the transformation of [[pseudospherical surface]]s introduced by [[Luigi Bianchi|L. Bianchi]] and [[Albert Victor Bäcklund|A.V. Bäcklund]] in the 1880s. This is a geometrical construction of a new pseudospherical surface from an initial such surface using a solution of a [[linear differential equation]]. Pseudospherical surfaces can be described as solutions of the [[sine-Gordon equation]], and hence the Bäcklund transformation of surfaces can be viewed as a transformation of solutions of the sine-Gordon equation.

==The Cauchy–Riemann equations==
{{see|Cauchy–Riemann equations}}
The prototypical example of a Bäcklund transform is the [[Cauchy–Riemann equations|Cauchy–Riemann system]]

:&lt;math&gt;u_x=v_y, \quad u_y=-v_x,\,&lt;/math&gt;

which relates the real and imaginary parts ''u'' and ''v'' of a [[holomorphic function]]. This first order system of partial differential equations has the following properties.

# If ''u'' and ''v'' are solutions of the Cauchy–Riemann equations, then ''u'' is a solution of the [[Laplace equation]]
: &lt;math&gt;u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0&lt;/math&gt; 
(i.e., a [[harmonic function]]), and so is ''v''. This follows straightforwardly by differentiating the equations with respect to ''x'' and ''y'' and using the fact that
#:&lt;math&gt;u_{xy}=u_{yx}, \quad v_{xy}=v_{yx},.\,&lt;/math&gt;
# Conversely if ''u'' is a solution of Laplace's equation, then there exist functions ''v'' which solve the Cauchy–Riemann equations together with ''u''.
Thus, in this case, a Bäcklund transformation of a harmonic function is just a [[conjugate harmonic function]]. The above properties mean, more precisely, that Laplace's equation for ''u'' and Laplace's equation for ''v'' are the [[integrability condition]]s for solving the Cauchy–Riemann equations.

These are the characteristic features of a Bäcklund transform. If we have a partial differential equation in ''u'', and a Bäcklund transform from ''u'' to ''v'', we can deduce a partial differential equation satisfied by ''v''.

This example is rather trivial, because all three equations (the equation for ''u'', the equation for ''v'' and the Bäcklund transform relating them) are linear. Bäcklund transforms are most interesting when just one of the three equations is linear.

==The sine-Gordon equation==
{{see|sine-Gordon equation}}
Suppose that ''u'' is a solution of the [[sine-Gordon equation]]
:&lt;math&gt; u_{xy} = \sin u.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Then the system
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
v_x &amp; = u_x + 2a \sin \Bigl( \frac{u+v}{2} \Bigr) \\
v_y &amp; = -u_y + \frac{2}{a} \sin \Bigl( \frac{v-u}{2} \Bigr)
\end{align} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'' is an arbitrary parameter, is solvable for a function ''v'' which will also satisfy the sine-Gordon equation. This is an example of an auto-Bäcklund transform.

By using a matrix system, it is also possible to find a linear Bäcklund transform for solutions of sine-Gordon equation.

==The Liouville equation==
{{see|Liouville equation}}
A Bäcklund transform can turn a non-linear partial differential equation into a simpler, linear, partial differential equation.

For example, if ''u'' and ''v'' are related via the Bäcklund transform

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
v_x &amp; = u_x + 2a \exp \Bigl( \frac{u+v}{2} \Bigr) \\
v_y &amp; = -u_y - \frac{1}{a} \exp \Bigl( \frac{u-v}{2} \Bigr)
\end{align} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'' is an arbitrary parameter, and if ''u'' is a solution of the [[Liouville equation]]

&lt;math&gt;u_{xy}=\exp u \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

then ''v'' is a solution of the much simpler equation, &lt;math&gt;v_{xy}=0&lt;/math&gt;, and vice versa.

We can then solve the (non-linear) Liouville equation by working with a much simpler linear equation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4368">In [[quantum information science]], the concurrence is a state invariant involving qubits.

==Definition==
The '''concurrence''' is an [[entanglement monotone]] defined for a mixed state of two [[qubit]]s as:&lt;ref name="Hill1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wootters1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hildebrand2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Horodecki2009"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}(\rho)\equiv\max(0,\lambda_1-\lambda_2-\lambda_3-\lambda_4) &lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;\lambda_1,...,\lambda_4&lt;/math&gt; are the eigenvalues, in decreasing order, of the Hermitian matrix

:&lt;math&gt;R = \sqrt{\sqrt{\rho}\tilde{\rho}\sqrt{\rho}} &lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\rho} = (\sigma_{y}\otimes\sigma_{y})\rho^{*}(\sigma_{y}\otimes\sigma_{y})&lt;/math&gt;
the spin-flipped state of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y&lt;/math&gt; a [[Pauli spin matrix]], and the eigenvalues listed in decreasing order.

A generalized version of concurrence for multiparticle pure states in arbitrary dimensions is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rungta|first=Pranaw|date=2001-01-01|title=Universal state inversion and concurrence in arbitrary dimensions|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.64.042315|journal=Physical Review A|volume=64|issue=4|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.64.042315|arxiv=quant-ph/0102040|bibcode=2001PhRvA..64d2315R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bhaskara|first=Vineeth S.|last2=Panigrahi|first2=Prasanta K.|date=2017-05-01|title=Generalized concurrence measure for faithful quantification of multiparticle pure state entanglement using Lagrange’s identity and wedge product|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11128-017-1568-0|journal=Quantum Information Processing|language=en|volume=16|issue=5|pages=118|doi=10.1007/s11128-017-1568-0|issn=1570-0755|arxiv=1607.00164|bibcode=2017QuIP...16..118B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}}(\rho)=\sqrt{2(1-\text{Tr}\rho^2_{\mathcal{M}})} &lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt; \rho_{\mathcal{M}} &lt;/math&gt; is the reduced density matrix across the bipartition &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{M} &lt;/math&gt; of the pure state, and it measures how much the complex amplitudes deviate from the constraints required for tensor separability. The faithful nature of the measure admits necessary and sufficient conditions of separability for pure states.

==Other formulations==
Alternatively, the &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{i}&lt;/math&gt;'s represent the square roots of the eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian matrix &lt;math&gt;\rho\tilde{\rho}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Wootters1998"/&gt; Note that each &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is a non-negative real number.  From the concurrence, the [[entanglement of formation]] can be calculated.
==Properties==

For pure states, the concurrence is a polynomial &lt;math&gt;SL(2,\mathbb{C})^{\otimes 2}&lt;/math&gt; invariant in the state's coefficients.&lt;ref name="Djocovic2009"/&gt; For mixed states, the concurrence can be defined by [[convex roof extension]].&lt;ref name="Hildebrand2007"/&gt;

For the concurrence, there is monogamy of entanglement,&lt;ref name="Coffman2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborne2006"/&gt; that is, the concurrence of a qubit with the rest of the system cannot ever exceed the sum of the concurrences of qubit pairs which it is part of.

'''[[Cryptography|Cryptographic]] [[Engineering]]''' is the discipline of using cryptography to solve human problems. Cryptography is typically applied when trying to ensure data [[confidentiality]], to [[authentication|authenticate]] people or devices, or to verify [[data integrity]] in risky environments.

Cryptographic engineering is a complicated, multidisciplinary field. It encompasses mathematics (algebra, finite groups, rings, and fields), computer engineering (hardware design, ASIC, embedded systems, FPGAs) and computer science (algorithms, complexity theory, software design). In order to practice state-of-the-art cryptographic design, mathematicians, computer scientists,
and electrical engineers need to collaborate.

Below are the main topics that are specifically related to cryptographic engineering:

Cryptographic implementations

==Major issues==

In modern practice, cryptographic engineering is deployed in [[crypto system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surreptitiously Weakening Cryptographic Systems|url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/097.pdf|website=[[International Association for Cryptologic Research]]|accessdate=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most engineering design, these are wholly human creations. Most crypto systems are [[computer software]], either embedded in [[firmware]] or running as ordinary executable files under an [[operating system]]. In some system designs, the cryptography runs under manual direction, in others, it is run automatically, often in the background. Like other software design, and unlike most other engineering, there are few external constraints.

===Active opposition===
In other engineering design, a successful design or implementation of one, is one which 'works'. Thus, an aircraft which actually flies without crashing due to some [[aerodynamic]] design  is a successful design. How successful is important, of course, and depends on how well it meets intended performance criteria. Continuing with the aircraft example, several [[World War I]] [[fighter aircraft]] designs only barely flew, while others flew well (at least one design flew well, but its wings broke off with some regularity) though with insufficient agility (turning, climbing, ..., rates) or insufficient stability (too frequent inescapable spins and so on) to be useful or survivable. To a considerable extent, good agility in aircraft is inversely related to inadequate stability, so fighter aircraft designs are, in this respect, inevitable compromises. The same considerations have  continued in more recent times, as for instance the necessity for computer 'fly-by-wire' control in some fighters with great agility.

Cryptographic designs also have performance goals (e.g., unbreakability of encryption), but must perform in a more complex, and more complexly hostile, environment than merely high (but not too low) in the Earth's atmosphere under war conditions.

Some aspects of the conditions under which crypto designs must work (to be successful and so worth bothering with) have been long recognized. Sensible cipher designers (of which there were fewer than their users would have wanted) attempted to find ways to prevent [[frequency analysis]] success, starting, it must be assumed, almost immediately after that cryptanalytic technique was first used. The most effective way to defeat frequency analysis attacks was the polyalphabetic substitution cipher, invented by [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] about 1465. For the next several hundred years, other designers also tried to evade frequency analysis, usually poorly, demonstrating that few had a clear understanding of the problem. What is probably the best known (and likely the widest used) of those attempts is the (misnamed) [[Vigenère cipher]] which is a partial implementation of Alberti's idea. [[Edgar Allan Poe]] famously, and rashly, boasted that no cipher could defeat his cryptanalytic talents (essentially frequency analysis); that he was almost entirely correct about the ciphertexts submitted to him suggests a low level of cryptographic awareness some 400 (!) years after Alberti. As this history suggests, an important part of crypto engineering is understanding the techniques the Opposition may have available.

In addition, it has been explicitly realized since the mid-19th century that the Opposition must be credited with certain kinds of knowledge, lest one's design efforts address too little. [[Kerckhoffs' Law]] -- "The security of a cipher must reside entirely in the key", and the equivalent, and somewhat less obscure, [[Claude Shannon|Shannon]]'s Maxim -- "The enemy knows the system", put it more or less clearly. A crypto design must achieve its goals (e.g., confidentiality, or message integrity—see 'goals' in the article [[cryptography]]), not only despite active intelligent Opposition, but in spite of uncomfortably well informed Opposition.

===Inherent zero-defect requirement===
Many failures in cryptographic engineering are catastrophic. That is, success in breaking one message leads to reading all messages. Most cryptographic algorithms and protocols make certain assumptions (random [[key (cryptography)|key]] or [[cryptographic nonce|nonce]] choices, for example), and when those assumptions are violated, all security is lost.

Examples: Netscape random bug found at UC Berkeley, Microsoft's PPTP protocol implementation problems found by Schneier.

===Invisibility of most failure modes===
Success in cryptographic engineering is unclear at best. Not crashing is a quite prominent ''[[sine qua non]]'' in aircraft design. Not allowing the Opposition access (to protected message traffic, for instance) is the design goal, but it is far less obvious when this goal has been achieved than in other engineering. Essentially no Opponents will ever make their access to message content public, and so neither designers nor implementors nor users of crypto systems will ever learn from them that their design is insecure. It is certainly irrational to count on Opponents as a quality control resource.

One tempting measure of security is 'I can't figure out how to break it, so I will assume Opponents will not be able to do so either'. This may be true, but there is no way to actually know your Opponents have the same limitations you do. In a modern environment, in which messages travel over public networks, it is not even possible to detect eavesdropping, much less to prevent it. Accordingly, most message traffic must be presumed to be entirely in an Opponent's possession.

Known cryptographic failures fall into several classes. Future failures may also, or may find new categories. Examples include:

Design errors:
*cryptographic protocol errors
*user operational procedure errors
*algorithm implementation errors
*associated system failures

User errors:
*misunderstanding of correct operations
*arbitrary user actions

Implementation errors:
*programming errors (bugs)
*precision arithmetic errors
*[[random]] data errors
*[[software library]] routine errors

Environment errors:
*operating system insecurities with effects on cryptographic software (e.g., keys retained in [[swap file]] data)
*operating system insecurities with regard to [[plaintext]] access
*operating system vulnerabilities ([[viruses]], [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]]s, etc.)

The effect of most of these will not be apparent to end users, generally not to the computer system's administrators, and often not even to the cryptographic system's designers. For instance, a [[buffer overflow]] vulnerability in an obligatory operating system component may not have been present in version 5.1 (used during crypto system testing), but appear only at version 5.3, available only after release of the crypto system. Or that particular vulnerability may have been removed in all operating system releases later than version 5.3, but the cryptographic system is being used in this case with version 5.1.

The invisibility of many such errors makes finding and removing them more difficult than in many other kinds of engineering.

The cipher is a Phase 3 Focus candidate for the [[eSTREAM]] project. The cipher is targeted for fast [[software]] implementations and versions with different [[Key (cryptography)|key]] lengths exists. The version selected for Phase 3 is Dragon-128. It is not [[Patent]]ed.

Dragon has not been successfully [[Stream cipher attack|attacked]] to date, but Cho and [[Josef Pieprzyk|Pieprzyk]] found biases within the primary non-linear component of the cipher.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream/papersdir/2007/002.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the security of the cipher is weaker than intended by its designers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1915">In [[mathematics]] &amp;mdash; specifically, in [[measure theory]] &amp;mdash; '''Fernique's theorem''' is a result about [[Gaussian measure]]s on [[Banach space]]s.  It extends the finite-dimensional result that a Gaussian [[random variable]] has [[Exponential function|exponential]] tails.  The result was proved in 1970 by the [[mathematician]] [[Xavier Fernique]].

==Statement of the theorem==
Let (''X'',&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;||) be a [[separable space|separable]] Banach space.  Let ''&amp;mu;'' be a centred Gaussian measure on ''X'', i.e. a [[probability measure]] defined on the [[Borel set]]s of ''X'' such that, for every [[bounded linear functional]] ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''', the [[push-forward measure]] ''ℓ''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;mu;'' defined on the [[Borel sets]] of '''R''' by

:&lt;math&gt;( \ell_{\ast} \mu ) (A) = \mu ( \ell^{-1} (A) ), &lt;/math&gt;

is a Gaussian measure (a [[normal distribution]]) with zero [[expected value|mean]].  Then there exists ''&amp;alpha;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{X} \exp ( \alpha \| x \|^{2} ) \, \mathrm{d} \mu (x) &lt; + \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

''[[A fortiori]]'', ''&amp;mu;'' (equivalently, any ''X''-valued random variable ''G'' whose [[probability distribution|law]] is ''&amp;mu;'') has [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] of all orders: for all ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E} [ \| G \|^{k} ] = \int_{X} \| x \|^{k} \, \mathrm{d} \mu (x) &lt; + \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

|'''Calculation of fugit:'''
For Fugit — where n is the number of time-steps in the tree; t is the time to option expiry; and i is the current time-step — the calculation is as follows:&lt;ref name = "Rubinstein"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;; see also&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref name="Benhamou"/&gt;

(1) set the fugit of all nodes at the end of the tree equal to i = n

(2) work backwards recursively: 
*if the option should be exercised at a node, set the fugit at that node equal to its period 
*if the option should not exercised at a node, set the fugit to the risk-neutral expected fugit over the next period.

(3) the number calculated in this fashion at the beginning of the first period (i=0) is the current fugit.

Finally, to annualize the fugit, multiply the resulting value by t / n.

In [[mathematical finance]], '''fugit''' is the expected (or optimal) date to exercise an [[Option style#American and European options|American-]] or [[Bermudan option]]. It is useful for [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] purposes here; see [[Greeks (finance)]] and [[Optimal stopping#Option trading]].  The term was first introduced by Mark Garman in an article "Semper tempus fugit" published in 1989.&lt;ref name="RISK 1989"&gt;Mark Garman in an article "Semper tempus fugit" published in 1989 by Risk Publications, and included in the book "From Black Scholes to Black Holes" pages 89-91&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Latin]] term "tempus fugit" means "time flies"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tempus it et tamquam mobilis aura volat|url=http://audiolatinproverbs.blogspot.com/2006/11/tempus-it-et-tamquam-mobilis-aura.html|publisher=Audio Latin Proverbs|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Garman suggested the name because "time flies especially when you're having fun managing your book of American options".

==Details==
Fugit provides an estimate of when an option would be exercised, which is then a useful indication for the maturity to use when hedging American or Bermudan products with [[European option]]s.&lt;ref name="Benhamou"&gt;Eric Benhamou: [http://ericbenhamou.net/documents/Encyclo/Fugit%20_options_.pdf Fugit (options)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Fugit is thus used for the hedging of [[convertible bond]]s, equity linked convertible notes, and any putable or callable [[exotic derivatives|exotic]] coupon notes.  Although see &lt;ref name ="citigroup"&gt;Christopher Davenport, [[Citigroup]], 2003. "Convertible Bonds A Guide".&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Wilmott]]'s comment on [http://wilmott.com/messageview.cfm?catid=34&amp;threadid=67833 a wilmott.com forum]: "But, yes, remember that you need to put the real drift in there otherwise it's just the risk-neutral time and therefore not so relevant."&lt;/ref&gt; for qualifications here. Fugit is also useful in estimating "the (risk-neutral) expected life of the option"&lt;ref&gt;Mark Rubinstein (1995). "[http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/finance/WP/rpf241.pdf On the Accounting Valuation of Employee Stock Options]", ''[[Journal of Derivatives]]'', Fall 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  for [[Employee stock option#Valuation|Employee stock options]] (note the brackets).

Fugit is calculated as "the expected time to exercise of American options",&lt;ref name="RISK 1989"/&gt; and is also described as the "[[risk-neutral]] expected life of the option"&lt;ref name = "Rubinstein"&gt;[[Mark Rubinstein]] in an article "Guiding force"; the calculation is detailed on pages 43 and 44, as well as in [http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/finance/WP/rpf220.pdf Exotic Options], a working paper by the same author.&lt;/ref&gt;  The computation requires a [[Binomial options pricing model|binomial tree]] — although a [[Finite difference methods for option pricing|Finite difference approach]] would also apply&lt;ref name="Benhamou"/&gt; — where, a second quantity, additional to option price, is required at each node of the tree;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codeforge.com/read/151281/fugit_binomialtree.txt__html Example VBA code]&lt;/ref&gt; see methodology aside. Note that fugit is not always a unique value.&lt;ref name ="citigroup"/&gt;

[[Nassim Taleb]] proposes a "rho fudge", as a “shortcut method...  to find the right duration (i.e., expected time to termination) for an American option”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-5-OldaTjVQC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq Pg. 178] of Nassim Taleb (1997). ''Dynamic Hedging: Managing Vanilla and Exotic Options''. New York: [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]. {{ISBN|0-471-15280-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taleb terms this result “Omega” as opposed to fugit. The formula is 
:''Omega = Nominal Duration x (Rho2 of an American option / Rho2 of a European option).''
Here, Rho2 refers to sensitivity to dividends or the foreign interest rate, as opposed to [[Greeks (finance)#Rho|the more usual rho]] which measures sensitivity to (local) interest rates; the latter is sometimes used, however.&lt;ref&gt;See for example  [http://www.nuclearphynance.com/Show%20Post.aspx?PostIDKey=125437 this discussion] on nuclearphynance.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Taleb notes that this approach was widely applied, already in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Nassim Taleb: [http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/rubinste.htm Review of ''Derivatives'' by Mark Rubinstein]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2139">In algebra, the '''fundamental theorem of [[algebraic K-theory]]''' describes the effects of [[change of rings|changing the ring]] of K-groups from a ring ''R'' to &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;R[t, t^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;. The theorem was first proved by Bass for &lt;math&gt;K_0, K_1&lt;/math&gt; and was later extended to higher K-groups by Quillen.

Let &lt;math&gt;G_i(R)&lt;/math&gt; be the algebraic K-theory of the category of finitely generated modules over a noetherian ring ''R''; explicitly, we can take &lt;math&gt;G_i(R) = \pi_i(B^+\text{f-gen-Mod}_R)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;B^+ = \Omega BQ&lt;/math&gt; is given by Quillen's [[Q-construction]]. If ''R'' is a [[regular ring]] (i.e., has finite [[global dimension]]), then &lt;math&gt;G_i(R) = K_i(R),&lt;/math&gt; the ''i''-th K-group of ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;By definition, &lt;math&gt;K_i(R) = \pi_i(B^+\text{proj-Mod}_R), \, i \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an immediate consequence of the [[resolution theorem (algebraic K-theory)|resolution theorem]], which compares the K-theories of two different categories (with inclusion relation.)

For a [[noetherian ring]] ''R'', the fundamental theorem states:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weibel|2013|loc=Ch. V. Theorem 3.3 and Theorem 6.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*(i) &lt;math&gt;G_i(R[t]) = G_i(R), \, i \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.
*(ii) &lt;math&gt;G_i(R[t, t^{-1}]) = G_i(R) \oplus G_{i-1}(R), \, i \ge 0, \, G_{-1}(R) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The proof of the theorem uses the [[Q-construction]]. There is also a version of the theorem for the singular case (for &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt;); this is the version proved in Grayson's paper.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3314">In the [[mathematics]] of [[coding theory]], the '''Griesmer bound''', named after James Hugo Griesmer, is a bound on the length of [[Linear code|linear]] [[Binary coding|binary]] [[Block code|code]]s of dimension ''k'' and minimum distance ''d''.
There is also a very similar version for non-binary codes.

== Statement of the bound ==
For a binary linear code, the Griesmer bound is:

: &lt;math&gt;n\geqslant \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left\lceil\frac{d}{2^i}\right\rceil.&lt;/math&gt;

== Proof== 

Let &lt;math&gt;N(k,d)&lt;/math&gt; denote the minimum length of a binary code of dimension ''k'' and distance ''d''. Let ''C'' be such a code. We want to show that 

:&lt;math&gt; N(k,d)\geqslant \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left\lceil\frac{d}{2^i}\right\rceil.&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''G'' be a generator matrix of ''C''. We can always suppose that the first row of ''G'' is of the form ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;0) with weight ''d''.
: &lt;math&gt;G= \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; \dots &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \dots &amp; 0 \\
\ast &amp; \ast  &amp; \ast &amp;   &amp; G' &amp;   \\
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The matrix &lt;math&gt;G'&lt;/math&gt; generates a code &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt;, which is called the residual code of &lt;math&gt;C.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; has obviously dimension &lt;math&gt;k'=k-1&lt;/math&gt; and length &lt;math&gt;n'=N(k,d)-d.&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;C'&lt;/math&gt; has a distance &lt;math&gt;d',&lt;/math&gt; but we don't know it. Let &lt;math&gt;u\in C'&lt;/math&gt; be such that &lt;math&gt;w(u)=d'&lt;/math&gt;. There exists a vector &lt;math&gt;v\in \mathbb{F}_2^d&lt;/math&gt; such that the concatenation &lt;math&gt;(v|u)\in C.&lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;w(v)+w(u)=w(v|u)\geqslant d.&lt;/math&gt; On the other hand, also &lt;math&gt;(v|u)+r\in C,&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;r\in C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is linear: &lt;math&gt;w((v|u)+r)\geqslant d.&lt;/math&gt; But

:&lt;math&gt;w((v|u)+r)=w(((1,\cdots,1)+v)|u)=d-w(v)+w(u),&lt;/math&gt;

so this becomes &lt;math&gt;d-w(v)+w(u)\geqslant d&lt;/math&gt;. By summing this with &lt;math&gt;w(v)+w(u)\geqslant d,&lt;/math&gt; we obtain &lt;math&gt;d+2w(u)\geqslant 2d&lt;/math&gt;. But &lt;math&gt;w(u)=d',&lt;/math&gt; so we get &lt;math&gt;d'\geqslant \tfrac{d}{2}.&lt;/math&gt; This implies 

:&lt;math&gt;n'\geqslant N\left (k-1,\tfrac{d}{2} \right ),&lt;/math&gt; 

therefore due to the integrality of &lt;math&gt;n'&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;n'\geqslant \left\lceil N\left (k-1,\tfrac{d}{2} \right ) \right\rceil,&lt;/math&gt; 

so that

:&lt;math&gt;N(k,d)\geqslant \left\lceil N\left (k-1,\tfrac{d}{2} \right )\right\rceil +d.&lt;/math&gt;

By induction over ''k'' we will eventually get 

:&lt;math&gt; N(k,d)\geqslant  \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left\lceil\frac{d}{2^i}\right\rceil.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that at any step the dimension decreases by 1 and the distance is halved, and we use the identity 

:&lt;math&gt;\left\lceil\frac{\left\lceil a/2^{k-1}\right\rceil}{2}\right\rceil = \left\lceil\frac{a}{2^k}\right\rceil&lt;/math&gt; 

for any integer ''a'' and positive integer ''k''.

== The bound for the general case==
For a  linear code over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_q&lt;/math&gt;, the Griesmer bound becomes:

: &lt;math&gt;n\geqslant \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left\lceil\frac{d}{q^i}\right\rceil.&lt;/math&gt;

The proof is similar to the binary case and so it is omitted.

'''Herbert Hall Turner''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (13 August 1861, [[Leeds]]&amp;nbsp;– 20 August 1930, [[Stockholm]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[astronomer]] and [[seismologist]].

==Biography==
Herbert Hall Turner was educated at the [[Leeds Modern School]], [[Clifton College]], Bristol and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=venn&gt;{{acad|id=TNR879HH|name=Turner, Herbert Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884 he accepted the post of Chief Assistant at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] and stayed there for nine years. In 1893&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Chairs and Professors of Universities in the United Kingdom|title=Who's Who Year-book for 1905|page=132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3sY0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA132}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became [[Savilian Professor of Astronomy]] and Director of the [[Radcliffe Observatory]] at [[Oxford University]], a post he held for 37 years until his sudden death in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Herbert Hall Turner| journal = Popular Astronomy |bibcode=1931PA.....39...59C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the observers in the Eclipse Expeditions of 1886 and 1887. In [[seismology]], he is credited with the discovery of [[deep focus earthquake]]s. He is also credited with coining the word ''[[parsec]]''.

His 1897 Royal Society candidature citation read: " ''	Secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society. Was Chief Assistant at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich 1884-1894. Author of various papers among which may be mentioned:-

He co-edited the first official history of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] along with [[John Louis Emil Dreyer]], ''History of the Royal Astronomical Society 1820–1920 (1923, reprinted 1987)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Astronomical Society (RAS)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/511254/Royal-Astronomical-Society-RAS/93551/Additional-Reading|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died of a brain haemorrhage in 1930 at a conference in Stockholm. He had married Agnes Margaret Whyte in 1899; they had one daughter, Ruth.

A few months before Turner's death in 1930, the [[Lowell Observatory]] announced the discovery of a new planet, and an eleven-year-old Oxford schoolgirl, [[Venetia Burney]], proposed the name [[Pluto]] for it to her grandfather [[Falconer Madan]], who was retired from the [[Bodleian Library]].&lt;ref name=Venetia&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3656">In mathematics, the '''Hurwitz problem''', named after [[Adolf Hurwitz]], is the problem of finding multiplicative relations between [[quadratic form]]s which generalise those known to exist between sums of squares in certain numbers of variables.

There are well-known multiplicative relationships between sums of squares in two variables

:&lt;math&gt; (x^2+y^2)(u^2+v^2) = (xu-yv)^2 + (xv+yu)^2 \ , &lt;/math&gt;

(known as the [[Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity]]), and also [[Euler's four-square identity]] and [[Degen's eight-square identity]].  These may be interpreted as multiplicativity for the norms on the [[complex number]]s, [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s respectively.&lt;ref name=Rajwade&gt;{{cite book | title=Squares | volume=171 | series=London Mathematical Society Lecture Note Series | first=A.

Albert, pages 100–125, [[Mathematical Association of America]], Solution of Hurwitz’s Problem on page 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hurwitz problem for the field ''K'' is to find general relations of the form

:&lt;math&gt; (x_1^2+\cdots+x_r^2) \cdot (y_1^2+\cdots+y_s^2) = (z_1^2 + \cdots + z_n^2) \ , &lt;/math&gt;

with the ''z'' being bilinear forms in the ''x'' and ''y'': that is, each ''z'' is a ''K''-linear combination of terms of the form ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Lam&gt;{{cite book | title=Introduction to Quadratic Forms over Fields | volume=67 | series=[[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]] | first=Tsit-Yuen | last=Lam | author-link=Tsit Yuen Lam | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=2005 | isbn=0-8218-1095-2 | zbl=1068.11023 | mr = 2104929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}} We call a triple (''r'',&amp;nbsp;''s'',&amp;nbsp;''n'') ''admissible'' for ''K'' if such an identity exists.&lt;ref name=Rajwade/&gt;{{rp|125}} Trivial cases of admissible triples include (''r'',&amp;nbsp;''s'',&amp;nbsp;''rs'').  The problem is uninteresting for ''K'' of characteristic&amp;nbsp;2, since over such fields every sum of squares is a square, and we exclude this case.  It is believed that otherwise admissibility is independent of the field of definition.&lt;ref name=Rajwade/&gt;{{rp|137}}

Hurwitz posed the problem in 1898 in the special case ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n'' and showed that, when coefficients are taken in '''C''', the only admissible values (''n'',&amp;nbsp;''n'',&amp;nbsp;''n'') were ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;8:&lt;ref name=Lam/&gt;{{rp|130}} his proof extends to any field of characteristic not 2.&lt;ref name=Rajwade/&gt;{{rp|3}}

The "Hurwitz–Radon" problem is that of finding admissible triples of the form (''r'',&amp;nbsp;''n'',&amp;nbsp;''n'').  Obviously (1,&amp;nbsp;''n'',&amp;nbsp;''n'') is admissible.  The '''Hurwitz–Radon theorem''' states that (ρ(''n''),&amp;nbsp;''n'',&amp;nbsp;''n'') is admissible over any field where ρ(''n'') is the function defined for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''u''&lt;/sup&gt;''v'', ''v'' odd, ''u''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'', 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;3, as ''ρ''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;8''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Rajwade/&gt;{{rp|137}}&lt;ref name=Lam/&gt;{{rp|130}}

Other admissible triples include (3,5,7)&lt;ref name=Rajwade/&gt;{{rp|138}} and (10,&amp;nbsp;10,&amp;nbsp;16).&lt;ref name=Rajwade/&gt;{{rp|137}}

The '''Johns Hopkins Symposium on Healthcare Operations''' is an annual conference series, sponsored by [[Johns Hopkins University]]'s [[Carey Business School]] and supported by [[Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions|Johns Hopkins]]'s business and medical faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hub.jhu.edu/events/2016/10/01/johns-hopkins-symposium-on-healthcare-operations/  |title= Johns Hopkins Symposium on Healthcare Operations: When organ transplantation meets operations research | publisher=hub.jhu.edu | date= August 2016 | accessdate = October 5, 2016   }}&lt;/ref&gt; This international symposium is the first and only multi-disciplinary forum bringing together internationally acclaimed medical doctors, operations researchers and policymakers, with a focus on policy-related research on the delivery of healthcare.

== Symposium structure ==
The symposium brings together leading [[business school]], [[engineering school]] and [[mathematics]] scholars, [[medical doctors]], and [[Health policy|health policy makers]] to share the latest advances in [[operations research]] applied to [[healthcare]], and promote [[Multidisciplinary approach|multidisciplinary]] dialogues among [[Academia|academics]], practitioners, and [[Policy maker|policymakers]].

Each year, the symposium focuses on one medical specialty, for example, in the case of 2016, [[transplant surgery]].

== 2016 Symposium: When Organ Transplantation Meets Operations Research ==

The theme of the first symposium, held on October 1, 2016, was "When [[Organ Transplantation]] Meets [[Operations Research]]." The 2016 symposium brought together [[operations research]]ers, [[transplant surgeon]]s, and [[policymakers]] to share cutting-edge research and practice in [[organ donation]], allocation, and transplantation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |  url= http://archive.carey.jhu.edu/johns-hopkins-symposium-on-healthcare-operations  | title= Johns Hopkins Symposium on Healthcare Operations, Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, October 1, 2016  | publisher = carey.jhu.edu  | date = October 1, 2016 | accessdate = October 4, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organizing committee was co-chaired by Tinglong Dai and Ozge Sahin from [[Johns Hopkins University]], and also consists of Sommer Gentry from [[United States Naval Academy]], [[Dorry Segev]] from [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], and [[Sridhar Tayur]] from [[Carnegie Mellon University]].

The attendees include [[operations research]] / [[operations management]] scholars from major business and engineer schools, transplant surgeons, medical doctors, and medical researchers from both United States and Canada. Representatives from [[Health Resources and Services Administration]], [[Organ transplantation|Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients]], [[Organ procurement organization|OPOs]], and private Insurers such as [[Highmark]] also attended the symposium.

'''''Ka·ṭa·pa·yā·di'' ([[Devanagari]]: कटपयादि) system''' (also known as ''Paralppēru'', Malayalam: [[:ml:പരല്‍പ്പേര്|പരല്‍പ്പേര്]]) of numerical notation is an [[ancient]] [[India]]n system to depict [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] to [[number|numerals]] for easy remembrance of [[number]]s as [[words]] or [[Verse (poetry)|verses]]. Assigning more than one letter to one numeral and nullifying certain other letters as valueless, this system provides the flexibility in forming meaningful words out of numbers which can be easily remembered.
[[File:Katapayadi-eng.svg|thumb|250px|KaTaPaYadi System - Values]]

== History ==
The oldest available evidence of the use of ''Kaṭapayādi'' (Sanskrit: कटपयादि) system is from ''Grahacāraṇibandhana'' by [[Haridatta]] in 683 [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref name="astro"&gt;Sreeramamula Rajeswara Sarma (1999), Kaṭapayādi Notation on a Sanskrit Astrolabe [http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/20005b66_273.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used in ''Laghu·bhāskarīya·vivaraṇa'' written by ''[[Sankara Narayana|Śaṅkara·nārāyaṇa]]'' in 869 [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Sankara.html|title=Sankara Narayana|last=J J O'Connor |author2=E F Robertson|date=November 2000 |publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, Scotland |accessdate=1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that the system originated from ''[[Vararuci]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-wireless.usenet-replayer.com/data/humanities/language/sanskrit/4154.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110717175501/http://www-wireless.usenet-replayer.com/data/humanities/language/sanskrit/4154.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 July 2011 |title=Aryabhatta's numerical encoding |last=Usenet Discussion |accessdate=1 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some astronomical texts popular in Kerala planetary positions were encoded in the Kaṭapayādi system. The first such work is considered to be the ''Chandra-vakyani'' of ''Vararuci'', who is traditionally assigned to the fourth century [[Common Era|CE]]. Therefore, sometime in the early first millennium is a reasonable estimate for the origin of the ''Kaṭapayādi'' system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Plofker|first=Kim |title=Mathematics in India|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=2008|pages=384|isbn= 978-0-691-12067-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aryabhata]], in his treatise ''[[Ārya·bhaṭīya]]'', is known to have used a similar, more complex system to represent [[astronomical]] [[number]]s. There is no definitive evidence whether the ''Ka-ṭa-pa-yā-di'' system originated from [[Āryabhaṭa numeration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=J. F. Fleet|date=Apr 1912|title=The Ka-ta-pa-ya-di Notation of the Second Arya-Siddhanta |journal=The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|publisher=[[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland]]|pages=459–462 |jstor=25190035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical spread of the use==
Almost all evidences of the use of ''Ka-ṭa-pa-yā-di'' system is from [[south India]], especially [[Kerala]]. Not much is known about its use in north India. However, on a [[Sanskrit]] [[astrolabe]] discovered in [[north India]], the degrees of the altitude are marked in the ''Kaṭapayādi'' system. It is preserved in the Sarasvathy Bhavan Library of [[Sampurnanand Sanskrit University]], [[Varanasi]].&lt;ref name="astro"/&gt;

The ''Ka-ṭa-pa-yā-di'' system is not confined to India. Some [[Pali]] [[chronogram]]s based on the ''Ka-ṭa-pa-yā-di'' system have been discovered in [[Burma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=J.F. Fleet|date=Jul 1911|title=The Katapayadi System of Expressing Numbers|journal=The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|publisher=[[Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland]]|pages=788–794 |jstor=25189917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules and practices ==
Following verse found in [[Sankara Varman|Śaṅkaravarman's]] ''[[Sadratnamala|Sadratnamāla]]'' explains the mechanism of the system.&lt;ref&gt;[[K. V. Sarma|Sarma, K.V.]] (2001). "Sadratnamala of Sankara Varman".

''miśre tūpāntyahal saṃkhyā na ca cintyo halasvaraḥ''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Translation: ''na'' (न), ''nya'' (ञ) and ''a'' (अ)-s, i.e., [[vowels]] represent [[zero]]. The nine [[integers]] are represented by [[consonant]] group beginning with ''ka'', ''ṭa'', ''pa'', ''ya''. In a [[conjunct]] consonant, the last of the consonants alone will count. A consonant without [[vowel]] is to be ignored.

Explanation: The assignment of letters to the numerals are as per the following arrangement.

* Consonants have numerals assigned as per the above table. For example, ba (ब) is always 3 whereas 5 can be represented by either ''nga'' (ङ) or ''ṇa'' (ण) or ''ma'' (म) or ''śha'' (श).
* All stand-alone vowels like ''a'' (अ) and ''ṛ'' (ऋ) are assigned to zero.
* In case of a conjunct, consonants attached to a non-vowel will not be valueless. For example, ''kya'' (क्या) is formed by ''k'' (क्) + ''ya'' (य) + ''a'' (अ). The only consonant standing with a vowel is ''ya'' (य). So the corresponding numeral for ''kya'' (क्या) will be 1.
* There is no way of representing [[Decimal separator]] in the system.
* Indians used the [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]] for numbering, traditionally written in increasing place values from left to right. This is as per the rule ''aṅkānām vāmato gatiḥ'' (अङ्कानाम् वामतो गतिः) which means numbers go from left to right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-wireless.usenet-replayer.com/data/humanities/language/sanskrit/4154.html Aryabhatta's Numerical Encoding]{{dead link|date=March 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variations===
* The [[consonant]], ḷ ([[Malayalam|Malayālam]]: ള, [[Devanāgarī]]: ळ), present in the [[Dravidian languages]] of [[south India]], is employed in works using the Kaṭapayādi system, like [[Mādhava's sine table]].
* Some{{Who|date=January 2010}} practitioners do not map the stand-alone vowels to zero. But, it is sometimes considered valueless.

== Usage ==

=== Mathematics and astronomy ===
* [[Mādhava's sine table]] constructed by 14th century [[Kerala]] [[mathematician]]-[[astronomer]] [[Mādhava of Saṅgama·grāma]] employs the Kaṭapayādi system to enlist the trigonometric sines of angles.
* ''[[Karaṇa·paddhati]]'', written in the 15th century, has the following ''śloka'' for the value of [[pi]] (π)
&lt;blockquote&gt;

:It gives the circumference of a circle of diameter, ''anūnanūnnānananunnanityai'' (10,000,000,000) as ''caṇḍāṃśucandrādhamakuṃbhipālair'' (31415926536).

* Śaṅkara·varman's ''[[Sad·ratna·mālā]]'' uses the Kaṭapayādi system. A famous verse found in ''[[Sad·ratna·mālā]]'' is

:Reversing the digits to modern day usage of descending order of decimal places, we get ''314159265358979324'' which is the value of [[pi]] (π) to 17 decimal places, except the last digit might be rounded off to 4.

* This verse encrypts the value of [[pi]] (π) up to 31 decimal places.

=== Carnatic music ===
[[Image:Melakarta.katapayadi.sankhya.72.png|250px|thumb|[[Melakarta]] chart as per Kaṭapayādi system]]
* The [[melakarta]] [[ragas]] of the Carnatic music is named so that the first two syllables of the name will give its number. This system is sometimes called the [[Ka-ta-pa-ya-di sankhya]]. The [[Swara]]s 'Sa' and 'Pa' are fixed, and here is how to get the other swaras from the melakarta number.

# Melakartas 1 through 36 have Ma1 and those from 37 through 72 have Ma2.
# The other notes are derived by noting the (integral part of the) quotient and remainder when one less than the melakarta number is divided by 6.
# 'Ri' and 'Ga' positions: the raga will have:
#* '''Ri1''' and '''Ga1''' if the quotient is 0
#* '''Ri1''' and '''Ga2''' if the quotient is 1
#* '''Ri1''' and '''Ga3''' if the quotient is 2
#* '''Ri2''' and '''Ga2''' if the quotient is 3
#* '''Ri2''' and '''Ga3''' if the quotient is 4
#* '''Ri3''' and '''Ga3''' if the quotient is 5
# 'Da' and 'Ni' positions: the raga will have:
#* '''Da1''' and '''Ni1''' if remainder is 0
#* '''Da1''' and '''Ni2''' if remainder is 1
#* '''Da1''' and '''Ni3''' if remainder is 2
#* '''Da2''' and '''Ni2''' if remainder is 3
#* '''Da2''' and '''Ni3''' if remainder is 4
#* '''Da3''' and '''Ni3''' if remainder is 5

*See [[Swara#Swaras in Carnatic music|swaras in Carnatic music]] for details on above notation.

====Raga [[Dheerasankarabharanam]]====

The katapayadi scheme associates dha&lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;9 and ra&lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;2, hence the raga's melakarta number is 29 (92 reversed). Now 29 &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; 36, hence Dheerasankarabharanam has Ma1. Divide 28 (1 less than 29) by 6, the [[quotient]] is 4 and the remainder 4. Therefore, this raga has Ri2, Ga3 (quotient is 4) and Da2, Ni3 (remainder is 4). Therefore, this raga's scale is ''Sa Ri2 Ga3 Ma1 Pa Da2 Ni3 SA''.

====Raga [[Kalyani (raga)|MechaKalyani]]====

From the coding scheme Ma &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; 5, Cha &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; 6. Hence the raga's melakarta number is 65 (56 reversed). 65 is greater than 36. So MechaKalyani has Ma2. Since the raga's number is greater than 36 subtract 36 from it. 65-36=29. 28 (1 less than 29) divided by 6: quotient=4, remainder=4. Ri2 Ga3 occurs. Da2 Ni3 occurs. So MechaKalyani has the notes ''Sa Ri2 Ga3 Ma2 Pa Da2 Ni3 SA''.

====Exception for [[Simhendramadhyamam]]====

As per the above calculation, we should get Sa &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; 7, Ha &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; 8 giving the number 87 instead of 57 for Simhendramadhyamam. This should be ideally Sa &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; 7, Ma &lt;math&gt;\leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; 5 giving the number 57. So it is believed that the name should be written as ''Sihmendramadhyamam'' (as in the case of Bra'''hm'''ana in Sanskrit).

=== Representation of dates ===
Important dates were remembered by converting them using ''Kaṭapayādi'' system. These dates are generally represented as number of days since the start of [[Kali Yuga]]. It is sometimes called ''kalidina sankhya''.

* The [[Malayalam calendar]] known as ''kollavarsham'' (Malayalam: കൊല്ലവര്‍ഷം) was adopted in Kerala beginning from 825 [[Common Era|CE]], revamping some calendars. This date is remembered as ''āchārya vāgbhadā'', converted using ''Kaṭapayādi'' into 1434160 days since the start of [[Kali Yuga]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis Zimmerman, 1989, Lilavati, gracious lady of arithmetic - India - A Mathematical Mystery Tour {{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1989_Nov/ai_8171045/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906215627/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1310/is_1989_Nov/ai_8171045/ |archivedate= 6 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lawoflargenumbers.svg|An illustration of the law of large numbers using a particular run of rolls of a single [[dice|die]].  As the number of rolls in this run increases, the average of the values of all the results approaches 3.5.  While different runs would show a different shape over a small number of throws (at the left), over a large number of rolls (to the right) they would be extremely similar.|thumb|right|400 px]]
{{Probability fundamentals}}
In [[probability theory]], the '''law of large numbers''' ('''LLN''') is a [[theorem]] that describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times.  According to the law, the [[average]] of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the [[expected value]], and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed.

The LLN is important because it guarantees stable long-term results for the averages of some random events. For example, while a casino may lose money in a single spin of the [[roulette]] wheel, its earnings will tend towards a predictable percentage over a large number of spins. Any winning streak by a player will eventually be overcome by the parameters of the game. It is important to remember that the law only applies (as the name indicates) when a ''large number'' of observations is considered. There is no principle that a small number of observations will coincide with the expected value or that a streak of one value will immediately be "balanced" by the others (see the [[gambler's fallacy]]).

==Examples==
For example, a single roll of a fair, six-sided dice produces one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, each with equal [[probability]].  Therefore, the expected value of a single die roll is
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6} = 3.5&lt;/math&gt;
According to the law of large numbers, if a large number of six-sided dice are rolled, the average of their values (sometimes called the [[sample mean]]) is likely to be close to 3.5, with the precision increasing as more dice are rolled.

It follows from the law of large numbers that the [[empirical probability]] of success in a series of [[Bernoulli trial]]s will converge to the theoretical probability. For a [[Bernoulli random variable]], the expected value is the theoretical probability of success, and the average of ''n'' such variables (assuming they are [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)]]) is precisely the relative frequency.

For example, a [[fair coin]] toss is a Bernoulli trial. When a fair coin is flipped once, the theoretical probability that the outcome will be heads is equal to 1/2. Therefore, according to the law of large numbers, the proportion of heads in a "large" number of coin flips "should be" roughly 1/2.  In particular, the proportion of heads after ''n'' flips will [[almost surely]] [[limit of a sequence|converge]] to 1/2 as ''n'' approaches infinity.

Although the proportion of heads (and tails) approaches 1/2, almost surely the [[absolute difference]] in the number of heads and tails will become large as the number of flips becomes large. That is, the probability that the absolute difference is a small number, approaches zero as the number of flips becomes large. Also, almost surely the ratio of the absolute difference to the number of flips will approach zero. Intuitively, expected absolute difference grows, but at a slower rate than the number of flips, as the number of flips grows.

==History==
[[File:DiffusionMicroMacro.gif|thumb|right|250px|[[Molecular diffusion|Diffusion]] is an example of the law of large numbers, applied to [[chemistry]]. Initially, there are [[solution|solute]] molecules on the left side of a barrier (magenta line) and none on the right. The barrier is removed, and the solute diffuses to fill the whole container.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Top:&lt;/u&gt; With a single molecule, the motion appears to be quite random.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Middle:&lt;/u&gt; With more molecules, there is clearly a trend where the solute fills the container more and more uniformly, but there are also random fluctuations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Bottom:&lt;/u&gt; With an enormous number of solute molecules (too many to see), the randomness is essentially gone: The solute appears to move smoothly and systematically from high-concentration areas to low-concentration areas. In realistic situations, chemists can describe diffusion as a deterministic macroscopic phenomenon (see [[Fick's law]]s), despite its underlying random nature.]]

The Italian mathematician [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1501–1576) stated without proof that the accuracies of empirical statistics tend to improve with the number of trials.&lt;ref&gt;Mlodinow, L. ''The Drunkard's Walk.'' New York: Random House, 2008.  p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; This was then formalized as a law of large numbers. A special form of the LLN (for a binary random variable) was first proved by [[Jacob Bernoulli]].&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Bernoulli, ''Ars Conjectandi: Usum &amp; Applicationem Praecedentis Doctrinae in Civilibus, Moralibus &amp; Oeconomicis'', 1713, Chapter 4, (Translated into English by Oscar Sheynin)&lt;/ref&gt; It took him over 20 years to develop a sufficiently rigorous mathematical proof which was published in his ''[[Ars Conjectandi]]'' (The Art of Conjecturing) in 1713. He named this his "Golden Theorem" but it became generally known as "'''Bernoulli's Theorem'''". This should not be confused with [[Bernoulli's principle]], named after Jacob Bernoulli's nephew [[Daniel Bernoulli]]. In 1837, [[Siméon Denis Poisson|S.D. Poisson]] further described it under the name "''la loi des grands nombres''" ("The law of large numbers").&lt;ref&gt;Poisson names the "law of large numbers" (''la loi des grands nombres'') in:  S.D. Poisson, ''Probabilité des jugements en matière criminelle et en matière civile, précédées des règles générales du calcul des probabilitiés'' (Paris, France:  Bachelier, 1837), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uovoFE3gt2EC&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage p. 7]. He attempts a two-part proof of the law on pp. 139–143 and pp. 277 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, Ian. (1983) "19th-century Cracks in the Concept of Determinism", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 44 (3), 455-475 {{jstor|2709176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, it was known under both names, but the "Law of large numbers" is most frequently used.

After Bernoulli and Poisson published their efforts, other mathematicians also contributed to refinement of the law, including [[Pafnuty Chebyshev|Chebyshev]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tchebichef | first1 = P. | title = Démonstration élémentaire d'une proposition générale de la théorie des probabilités | doi = 10.1515/crll.1846.33.259 | journal = Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik (Crelles Journal) | volume = 1846 | issue = 33 | pages = 259–267 | year = 1846 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrey Markov|Markov]], [[Émile Borel|Borel]], [[Francesco Paolo Cantelli|Cantelli]] and [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]] and [[Aleksandr Khinchin|Khinchin]]. Markov showed that the law can apply to a random variable that does not have a finite variance under some other weaker assumption, and Khinchin showed in 1929 that if the series consists of independent identically distributed random variables, it suffices that the [[expected value]] exists for the weak law of large numbers to be true.{{sfn|Seneta|2013}}&lt;ref name=EncMath&gt;{{cite web|author1=Yuri Prohorov|authorlink1=Yuri Vasilyevich Prokhorov|title=Law of large numbers|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Law_of_large_numbers| website=Encyclopedia of Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; These further studies have given rise to two prominent forms of the LLN. One is called the "weak" law and the other the "strong" law, in reference to two different modes of [[limit of a sequence|convergence]] of the cumulative sample means to the expected value; in particular, as explained below, the strong form implies the weak.{{sfn|Seneta|2013}}

==Forms==
Two different versions of the '''law of large numbers''' are described below; they are called the '' '''strong law''' of large numbers'', and the '' '''weak law''' of large numbers''.
Stated for the case where ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... is an infinite sequence of [[i.i.d.]] Lebesgue integrable random variables with expected value E(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = E(''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ...= ''µ'', both versions of the law state that &amp;ndash; with virtual certainty &amp;ndash; the sample average

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_n=\frac1n(X_1+\cdots+X_n) &lt;/math&gt;

converges to the expected value
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{}\\
\overline{X}_n \, \to \, \mu \qquad\textrm{for}\qquad n \to \infty,
\\{}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|law. 1}}}}

(Lebesgue integrability of ''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' means that the expected value E(''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'') exists according to [[Lebesgue integration]] and is finite.  It does ''not'' mean that the associated probability measure is [[absolutely continuous]] with respect to [[Lebesgue measure]].)

An assumption of finite [[variance]] Var(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = Var(''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ... = ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; ∞ is '''not necessary'''. Large or infinite variance will make the convergence slower, but the LLN holds anyway. This assumption is often used because it makes the proofs easier and shorter.

[[Independence (probability theory)#More than two random variables|Mutual independence]] of the random variables can be replaced by [[pairwise independence]] in both versions of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Etemadi|first1=N.Z.|title=An elementary proof of the strong law of large numbers|journal=Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie verw Gebiete|date=1981|volume=55|issue=1|pages=119–122|doi=10.1007/BF01013465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between the strong and the weak version is concerned with the mode of convergence being asserted. For interpretation of these modes, see [[Convergence of random variables]].

===Weak law===
[[File:Lawoflargenumbersanimation2.gif|thumb|Simulation illustrating the law of large numbers. Each frame, a coin that is red on one side and blue on the other is flipped, and a dot is added in the corresponding column. A pie chart shows the proportion of red and blue so far. Notice that while the proportion varies significantly at first, it approaches 50% as the number of trials increases.]]
The '''weak law of large numbers''' (also called [[Aleksandr Khinchin|Khinchin]]'s law) states that the sample average [[Convergence in probability|converges in probability]]  towards the expected value&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Loève|1977|loc=Chapter 1.4, p. 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{}\\
    \overline{X}_n\ \xrightarrow{P}\ \mu \qquad\textrm{when}\ n \to \infty.
\\{}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|law. 2}}}}

That is, for any positive number ''ε'',

: &lt;math&gt;
    \lim_{n\to\infty}\Pr\!\left(\,|\overline{X}_n-\mu| &gt; \varepsilon\,\right) = 0.
  &lt;/math&gt;

Interpreting this result, the weak law states that for any nonzero margin specified, no matter how small, with a sufficiently large sample there will be a very high probability that the average of the observations will be close to the expected value; that is, within the margin.

As mentioned earlier, the weak law applies in the case of i.i.d. random variables, but it also applies in some other cases. For example, the variance may be different for each random variable in the series, keeping the expected value constant. If the variances are bounded, then the law applies, as shown by [[Pafnuty Chebyshev|Chebyshev]] as early as 1867. (If the expected values change during the series, then we can simply apply the law to the average deviation from the respective expected values. The law then states that this converges in probability to zero.) In fact, Chebyshev's proof works so long as the variance of the average of the first ''n'' values goes to zero as ''n'' goes to infinity.&lt;ref name=EncMath/&gt; As an example, assume that each random variable in the series follows a [[Gaussian distribution]] with mean zero, but with variance equal to &lt;math&gt;2n/\log(n+1).&lt;/math&gt; At each stage, the average will be normally distributed (as the average of a set of normally distributed variables). The variance of the sum is equal to the sum of the variances, which is [[asymptotic]] to &lt;math&gt;n^2/\log n&lt;/math&gt;. The variance of the average is therefore asymptotic to &lt;math&gt;1/\log n&lt;/math&gt; and goes to zero.

An example where the law of large numbers does ''not'' apply is the [[Cauchy distribution]]. Let the random numbers equal the tangent of an angle uniformly distributed between −90° and +90°. The [[median]] is zero, but the expected value does not exist, and indeed the average of ''n'' such variables has the same distribution as one such variable. It does not tend toward zero as ''n'' goes to infinity.

There are also examples of the weak law applying even though the expected value does not exist. See [[#Differences between the weak law and the strong law]].

===Strong law===
The '''strong law of large numbers''' states that the sample average [[Almost sure convergence|converges almost surely]] to the expected value&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Loève|1977|loc=Chapter 17.3, p. 251}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{}\\
    \bar{X}_n\ \xrightarrow{\text{a.s.}}\ \mu \qquad\textrm{when}\ n \to \infty.
\\{}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|law. 3}}}}

That is,

: &lt;math&gt;
    \Pr\!\left( \lim_{n\to\infty}\bar{X}_n = \mu \right) = 1.
  &lt;/math&gt;
What this means is that as the number of trials ''n'' goes to infinity, the probability that the average of the observations is equal to the expected value will be equal to one.

The proof is more complex than that of the weak law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/06/18/the-strong-law-of-large-numbers/ |title=The strong law of large numbers – What's new |publisher=Terrytao.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law justifies the intuitive interpretation of the expected value (for Lebesgue integration only) of a random variable when sampled repeatedly as the "long-term average".

Almost sure convergence is also called strong convergence of random variables. This version is called the strong law because random variables which converge strongly (almost surely) are guaranteed to converge weakly (in probability). The strong law implies the weak law but not vice versa, when the strong law conditions hold the variable converges both strongly (almost surely) and  weakly (in probability). 
However the weak law may hold in conditions where the strong law does not hold and then the convergence is only weak (in probability).{{clarify|reason=Warning: This is ambiguous. By using the fuzzy word "may", it says that EITHER the weak law is known to hold under broader conditions than the strong law, OR the weak law is known to hold under certain conditions where the strong law is not known to hold, OR it is not known whether the weak law holds under broader conditions that the strong law. |date=November 2016}}

&lt;!--The reference provided for the following doesn't seem to say this:
There are different views among mathematicians whether the two laws could be unified to one law, thereby replacing the weak law.&lt;ref name="Testing Statistical Hypotheses"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kzPBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA219&amp;lpg=PA219#v=onepage&amp;q=is%20of%20very%20limited%20interest%20and%20should%20be%20replaced%20by%20the%20more%20precise%20and%20more%20useful%20strong%20law%20of%20large%20numbers | title=Law of large numbers views }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date it has not been possible to prove that the strong law conditions are the same as those of the weak law.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
--&gt;

The strong law of large numbers can itself be seen as a special case of the [[Ergodic theory#Ergodic theorems|pointwise ergodic theorem]].

The strong law applies to independent identically distributed random variables having an expected value (like the weak law). This was proved by Kolmogorov in 1930. It can also apply in other cases. Kolmogorov also showed, in 1933, that if the variables are independent and identically distributed, then for the average to converge almost surely on ''something'' (this can be considered another statement of the strong law), it is necessary that they have an expected value (and then of course the average will converge almost surely on that).&lt;ref name=EMStrong&gt;{{cite web|author1=Yuri Prokhorov|title=Strong law of large numbers|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Strong_law_of_large_numbers|website=Encyclopedia of Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the summands are independent but not identically distributed, then

: &lt;math&gt;
    \bar{X}_n - \operatorname{E}\big[\bar{X}_n\big]\ \xrightarrow{\text{a.s.}}\ 0,
  &lt;/math&gt;

provided that each ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; has a finite second moment and

: &lt;math&gt;
    \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^2} \operatorname{Var}[X_k] &lt; \infty.
  &lt;/math&gt;

This statement is known as ''Kolmogorov's strong law'', see e.g. {{harvtxt|Sen|Singer|1993|loc=Theorem 2.3.10}}.

An example of a series where the weak law applies but not the strong law is when ''X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is plus or minus &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{k/\log\log\log k}&lt;/math&gt; (starting at sufficiently large ''k'' so that the denominator is positive) with probability 1/2 for each.&lt;ref name=EMStrong/&gt; The variance of ''X&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is then &lt;math&gt;k/\log\log\log k.&lt;/math&gt; Kolmogorov's strong law does not apply because the partial sum in his criterion up to ''k=n'' is asymptotic to &lt;math&gt;\log n/\log\log\log n&lt;/math&gt; and this is unbounded.

If we replace the random variables with Gaussian variables having the same variances, namely &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{k/\log\log\log k},&lt;/math&gt; then the average at any point will also be normally distributed. The width of the distribution of the average will tend toward zero (standard deviation asymptotic to &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{2\log\log\log n}&lt;/math&gt;), but for a given ε, there is probability which does not go to zero with ''n'' that the average sometime after the ''n''th trial will come back up to ε. Since this probability does not go to zero {{clarify|reason=How can we see this does not go to zero? |date=October 2018}}, it must have a positive lower bound ''p''(ε), which means there is a probability of at least ''p''(ε) that the average will attain ε after ''n'' trials. It will happen with probability ''p''(ε)/2 before some ''m'' which depends on ''n''. But even after ''m'', there is still a probability of at least ''p''(ε) that it will happen. (This seems to indicate that ''p''(ε)=1 and the average will attain ε an infinite number of times.)

===Differences between the weak law and the strong law===
The ''weak law'' states that for a specified large ''n'', the average &lt;math style="vertical-align:-.35em"&gt;\overline{X}_n&lt;/math&gt; is likely to be near ''μ''. Thus, it leaves open the possibility that &lt;math style="vertical-align:-.4em"&gt;|\overline{X}_n -\mu| &gt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; happens an infinite number of times, although at infrequent intervals. (Not necessarily &lt;math style="vertical-align:-.4em"&gt;|\overline{X}_n -\mu| \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; for all n).

The ''strong law'' shows that this [[almost surely]] will not occur. In particular, it implies that with probability 1, we have that for any {{nowrap|''ε'' &gt; 0}} the inequality &lt;math style="vertical-align:-.4em"&gt;|\overline{X}_n -\mu| &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; holds for all large enough ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ross|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strong law does not hold in the following cases, but the weak law does.&lt;ref name="Weak law converges to constant"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=K6t5qn-SEp8C&amp;pg=PA432&amp;lpg=PA432&amp;q=%22even%20if%20the%20mean%20does%20not%20exist%22 | title=Weak law converges to constant | isbn=9780387276052 | author1=Lehmann | first1=Erich L | last2=Romano | first2=Joseph P | date=2006-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A NOTE ON THE WEAK LAW OF LARGE NUMBERS FOR EXCHANGEABLE RANDOM VARIABLES|url=http://www.mathnet.or.kr/mathnet/kms_tex/31810.pdf|publisher=Dguvl Hun Hong and Sung Ho Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=weak law of large numbers: proof using characteristic functions vs proof using truncation VARIABLES|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/266870/weak-law-of-large-numbers-proof-using-characteristic-functions-vs-proof-using-t}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Let X be an [[Exponential distribution|exponentially]] distributed random variable with parameter 1. The random variable &lt;math&gt;\sin(X)e^X X^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; has no expected value according to Lebesgue integration, but using conditional convergence and interpreting the integral as a [[Dirichlet integral]], which is an improper [[Riemann integral]], we can say:

:&lt;math&gt; E\left(\frac{\sin(X)e^X}{X}\right) =\ \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(x)e^x}{x}e^{-x}dx = \frac{\pi}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

The random variable &lt;math&gt;2^X(-1)^X X^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; does not have an expected value in the conventional sense because the infinite [[Series (mathematics)|series]] is not absolutely convergent, but using conditional convergence, we can say:

:&lt;math&gt; E\left(\frac{2^X(-1)^X}{X}\right) =\ \sum_{1}^{\infty}\frac{2^x(-1)^x}{x}2^{-x}=-\ln(2) &lt;/math&gt;

3. If the cumulative distribution function of a random variable is

:&lt;math&gt; 1-F(x)=\frac{e}{2x\ln(x)},x \ge e  &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;  F(x)=\frac{e}{-2x\ln(-x)},x \le -e &lt;/math&gt;
:then it has no expected value, but the weak law is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mukherjee|first1=Sayan|title=Law of large numbers|url=http://www.isds.duke.edu/courses/Fall09/sta205/lec/lln.pdf|access-date=2014-06-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309032810/http://www.isds.duke.edu/courses/Fall09/sta205/lec/lln.pdf|archive-date=2013-03-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=J.

===Uniform law of large numbers===
Suppose ''f''(''x'',''θ'') is some [[Function (mathematics)|function]] defined for ''θ'' ∈ Θ, and continuous in ''θ''. Then for any fixed ''θ'', the sequence {''f''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''θ''), ''f''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''θ''), …} will be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables, such that the sample mean of this sequence converges in probability to E[''f''(''X'',''θ'')]. This is the ''pointwise'' (in ''θ'') convergence.

The '''uniform law of large numbers''' states the conditions under which the convergence happens ''uniformly'' in ''θ''. If&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newey|McFadden|1994|loc=Lemma 2.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1214/aoms/1177697731|title=Asymptotic Properties of Non-Linear Least Squares Estimators|year=1969|last1=Jennrich|first1=Robert I.|journal=The Annals of Mathematical Statistics|volume=40|issue=2|pages=633–643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Θ is compact,
# ''f''(''x'',''θ'') is continuous at each ''θ'' ∈ Θ for [[Almost everywhere|almost all]] ''x''s, and measurable function of ''x'' at each ''θ''.
# there exists a [[Dominated convergence theorem|dominating]] function ''d''(''x'') such that E[''d''(''X'')] &lt; ∞, and
#: &lt;math&gt; \left\| f(x,\theta) \right\| \leq d(x) \quad\text{for all}\ \theta\in\Theta.&lt;/math&gt;

Then E[''f''(''X'',''θ'')] is continuous in ''θ'', and

: &lt;math&gt;
    \sup_{\theta\in\Theta} \left\| \frac1n\sum_{i=1}^n f(X_i,\theta) - \operatorname{E}[f(X,\theta)] \right\| \xrightarrow{\mathrm{a.s.}} \ 0.
  &lt;/math&gt;

This result is useful to derive consistency of a large class of estimators (see [[Extremum estimator]]).

===Borel's law of large numbers===
'''Borel's law of large numbers''', named after [[Émile Borel]], states that if an experiment is repeated a large number of times, independently under identical conditions, then the proportion of times that any specified event occurs approximately equals the probability of the event's occurrence on any particular trial; the larger the number of repetitions, the better the approximation tends to be. More precisely, if ''E'' denotes the event in question, ''p'' its probability of occurrence, and ''N&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''E'') the number of times ''E'' occurs in the first ''n'' trials, then with probability one,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2323947?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103621939777 An Analytic Technique to Prove Borel's Strong Law of Large Numbers Wen, L. Am Math Month 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{N_n(E)}{n}\to p\text{ as }n\to\infty.&lt;/math&gt;
This theorem makes rigorous the intuitive notion of probability as the long-run relative frequency of an event's occurrence.  It is a special case of any of several more general laws of large numbers in probability theory.

'''[[Chebyshev's inequality]]'''. Let ''X'' be a [[random variable]] with finite [[expected value]] ''μ'' and finite non-zero [[variance]] ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Then for any [[real number]] {{nowrap|''k'' &gt; 0}},
: &lt;math&gt;
    \Pr(|X-\mu|\geq k\sigma) \leq \frac{1}{k^2}.
  &lt;/math&gt;

==Proof of the weak law==
Given ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... an infinite sequence of [[i.i.d.]] random variables with finite expected value ''E''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''E''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = ... = µ &lt; ∞, we are interested in the convergence of the sample average

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_n=\tfrac1n(X_1+\cdots+X_n). &lt;/math&gt;

The weak law of large numbers states:
{{NumBlk||'''Theorem:''' &lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{}\\
    \overline{X}_n\ \xrightarrow{P}\ \mu \qquad\textrm{when}\ n \to \infty.
\\{}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationNote|law. 2}}}}

===Proof using Chebyshev's inequality assuming finite variance===
This proof uses the assumption of finite [[variance]] &lt;math&gt; \operatorname{Var} (X_i)=\sigma^2 &lt;/math&gt; (for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;). The independence of the random variables implies no correlation between them, and we have that

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{Var}(\overline{X}_n) = \operatorname{Var}(\tfrac1n(X_1+\cdots+X_n)) = \frac{1}{n^2} \operatorname{Var}(X_1+\cdots+X_n) = \frac{n\sigma^2}{n^2} = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The common mean μ of the sequence is the mean of the sample average:

:&lt;math&gt;
E(\overline{X}_n) = \mu.
&lt;/math&gt;

Using [[Chebyshev's inequality]] on &lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_n &lt;/math&gt; results in

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{P}( \left| \overline{X}_n-\mu \right| \geq \varepsilon) \leq \frac{\sigma^2}{n\varepsilon^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This may be used to obtain the following:

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{P}( \left| \overline{X}_n-\mu \right| &lt; \varepsilon) = 1 - \operatorname{P}( \left| \overline{X}_n-\mu \right| \geq \varepsilon) \geq 1 - \frac{\sigma^2}{n \varepsilon^2 }.
&lt;/math&gt;

As ''n'' approaches infinity, the expression approaches 1. And by definition of [[convergence in probability]], we have obtained

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{}\\
    \overline{X}_n\ \xrightarrow{P}\ \mu \qquad\textrm{when}\ n \to \infty.
\\{}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationNote|law. 2}}}}

===Proof using convergence of characteristic functions===
By [[Taylor's theorem]] for [[complex function]]s, the [[Characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] of any random variable, ''X'', with finite mean μ, can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_X(t) = 1 + it\mu + o(t), \quad t \rightarrow 0.&lt;/math&gt;

All ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... have the same characteristic function, so we will simply denote this ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Among the basic properties of characteristic functions there are

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\frac 1 n X}(t)= \varphi_X(\tfrac t n) \quad \text{and} \quad
 \varphi_{X+Y}(t)=\varphi_X(t) \varphi_Y(t) \quad &lt;/math&gt; if ''X'' and ''Y'' are independent.

These rules can be used to calculate the characteristic function of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\overline{X}_n&lt;/math&gt; in terms of ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_{\overline{X}_n}(t)= \left[\varphi_X\left({t \over n}\right)\right]^n = \left[1 + i\mu{t \over n} + o\left({t \over n}\right)\right]^n \, \rightarrow \, e^{it\mu}, \quad \text{as} \quad n \rightarrow \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

The limit &amp;nbsp;''e''&lt;sup&gt;''it''μ&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp; is the characteristic function of the constant random variable μ, and hence by the [[Lévy continuity theorem]], &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle\overline{X}_n&lt;/math&gt; [[Convergence in distribution|converges in distribution]] to μ:

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{X}_n \, \xrightarrow{\mathcal D} \, \mu \qquad\text{for}\qquad n \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

μ is a constant, which implies that convergence in distribution to μ and convergence in probability to μ are equivalent (see [[Convergence of random variables]].) Therefore,
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}{}\\
    \overline{X}_n\ \xrightarrow{P}\ \mu \qquad\textrm{when}\ n \to \infty.
\\{}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationNote|law. 2}}}}
This shows that the sample mean converges in probability to the derivative of the characteristic function at the origin, as long as the latter exists.

In [[algebraic geometry]], the '''lemniscate of Gerono''', or '''lemniscate of Huygens''', or '''figure-eight curve''', is a [[algebraic curve|plane algebraic curve]] of degree four and [[geometric genus|genus]] zero and is a [[lemniscate]] curve shaped like an [[Infinity|&lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;]] symbol, or figure eight. It has equation

:&lt;math&gt;x^4-x^2+y^2 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

It was studied by [[Camille-Christophe Gerono]].

Because the curve is of genus zero, it can be parametrized by rational functions; one means of doing that is

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{t^2-1}{t^2+1},\ y = \frac{2t(t^2-1)}{(t^2+1)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Another representation is
:&lt;math&gt;x = \cos \varphi,\ y = \sin\varphi\,\cos\varphi = \sin(2\varphi)/2&lt;/math&gt;
which reveals that this lemniscate is a special case of a [[Lissajous figure]].

The [[dual curve]] (see [[Plücker formula]]), pictured below, has therefore a somewhat different character. Its equation is

:&lt;math&gt;(x^2-y^2)^3 + 8y^4+20x^2y^2-x^4-16y^2=0.&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;O(d^5n\log^3 B)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where B is the largest length of &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; under the Euclidean norm.

The original applications were to give polynomial-time algorithms for [[Polynomial factorization#Factoring univariate polynomials over the integers|factorizing polynomials with rational coefficients]], for finding [[Dirichlet's approximation theorem#Simultaneous Version|simultaneous rational approximations to real numbers]], and for solving the [[linear programming|integer linear programming problem]] in fixed dimensions.

==LLL reduction==
The precise definition of LLL-reduced is as follows: Given a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}=\{ \mathbf{b}_0,\mathbf{b}_1, \dots, \mathbf{b}_n \},&lt;/math&gt;

define its [[Gram–Schmidt process]] orthogonal basis

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}^*=\{ \mathbf{b}^*_0, \mathbf{b}^*_1, \dots, \mathbf{b}^*_n \},&lt;/math&gt;

and the Gram-Schmidt coefficients
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_{i,j}=\frac{\langle\mathbf{b}_i,\mathbf{b}^*_j\rangle}{\langle\mathbf{b}^*_j,\mathbf{b}^*_j\rangle}&lt;/math&gt;, for any &lt;math&gt;1 \le j &lt; i \le n&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the basis &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is LLL-reduced if there exists a parameter &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; in (0.25,1] such that the following holds:

# (size-reduced) For &lt;math&gt;1 \leq j &lt; i \leq n\colon \left|\mu_{i,j}\right|\leq 0.5&lt;/math&gt;. By definition, this property guarantees the length reduction of the ordered basis.
#  (Lovász condition) For k = 1,2,..,n &lt;math&gt;  \colon \delta \Vert \mathbf{b}^*_{k-1}\Vert^2  \leq \Vert \mathbf{b}^*_k\Vert^2+ \mu_{k,k-1}^2\Vert 
 \mathbf{b}^*_{k-1}\Vert^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Here, estimating the value of the &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; parameter, we can conclude how well the basis is reduced. Greater values of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; lead to stronger reductions of the basis.
Initially, A. Lenstra, H. Lenstra and L. Lovász demonstrated the LLL-reduction algorithm for &lt;math&gt;\delta = \frac{3}{4}&lt;/math&gt;.
Note that although LLL-reduction is well-defined for &lt;math&gt;\delta = 1&lt;/math&gt;, the polynomial-time complexity is guaranteed only
for &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(0.25,1)&lt;/math&gt;.

The LLL algorithm computes LLL-reduced bases. There is no known efficient algorithm to compute a basis in which the basis vectors are as short as possible for lattices of dimensions greater than 4.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} However, an LLL-reduced basis is nearly as short as possible, in the sense that there are absolute bounds &lt;math&gt;c_i &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; such that the first basis vector is no more than &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; times as long as a shortest vector in the lattice,
the second basis vector is likewise within &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; of the second successive minimum, and so on.

Let a lattice basis &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{b}_1,\mathbf{b}_2, \mathbf{b}_3 \in Z^{3}&lt;/math&gt;, be given by the columns of
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; -1&amp; 3\\
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 5\\
    1 &amp; 2 &amp; 6
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Then according to the LLL algorithm we obtain the following:
{{Ordered list
|&lt;math&gt;b_{1}^{*}= b_{1}=
\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\1\end{bmatrix},B_{1}= \langle b_{1}^{*}, b_{1}^{*} \rangle =
\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\1\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\1\end{bmatrix}
= 3&lt;/math&gt;
|For &lt;math&gt;i=2&lt;/math&gt; DO:
{{Ordered list
|For &lt;math&gt;j=1&lt;/math&gt;  set &lt;math&gt;\mu_{2,1}= \frac{\langle b_{2}, b_{1}^{*} \rangle}{B_{1}}=
\frac{\begin{bmatrix}-1\\0\\2\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\1\end{bmatrix}}{3}=\frac{1}{3}\left(&lt; \frac{1}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and  &lt;math&gt;b_{2}^{*}= b_{2}- \mu_{2,1}b_{1}^{*}= \begin{bmatrix}-1\\0\\2\end{bmatrix}- \frac{1}{3}\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{-4}{3}\\\frac{-1}{3}\\\frac{5}{3}
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;B_{2}= \langle b_{2}^{*}, b_{2}^{*} \rangle =
\begin{bmatrix}\frac{-4}{3}\\\frac{-1}{3}\\\frac{5}{3}\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}\frac{-4}{3}\\\frac{-1}{3}\\\frac{5}{3}\end{bmatrix}= \frac{14}{3}.&lt;/math&gt;
}}
|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}:=2&lt;/math&gt;

|Here the step 4 of the LLL algorithm is skipped as size-reduced property holds for 
&lt;math&gt;\mu_{2,1}&lt;/math&gt;
|For &lt;math&gt;i=3&lt;/math&gt; and for &lt;math&gt;j=1,2&lt;/math&gt; calculate &lt;math&gt; \mu_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_{i}&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math&gt;\mu_{3,1}= \frac{\langle b_{3}, b_{1}^{*} \rangle}{B_{1}}=
\frac{\begin{bmatrix}3\\5\\6\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\1\end{bmatrix}}{3}=\frac{14}{3}(&gt; \frac{1}{2})&lt;/math&gt;

hence &lt;math&gt;b_{3}^{*}= b_{3}- \mu_{3,1}b_{1}^{*}= \begin{bmatrix}3\\5\\6\end{bmatrix}- \frac{14}{3}\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\1\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{-5}{3}\\\frac{1}{3}\\\frac{4}{3}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\mu_{3,2}= \frac{\langle b_{3}, b_{2}^{*} \rangle}{B_{2}}=
\frac{\begin{bmatrix}3\\5\\6\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}\frac{-4}{3}\\\frac{-1}{3}\\\frac{5}{3}\end{bmatrix}}{\frac{14}{3}}=\frac{13}{14}\left(&gt; \frac{1}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

hence &lt;math&gt;b_{3}^{*}= b_{3}^{*}- \mu_{3,2}b_{2}^{*}= \begin{bmatrix}\frac{-5}{3}\\\frac{1}{3}\\\frac{4}{3}\end{bmatrix}- \frac{13}{14}\begin{bmatrix}\frac{-4}{3}\\\frac{-1}{3}\\\frac{5}{3}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{-18}{42}\\\frac{27}{42}\\\frac{-9}{42}\end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix}\frac{-6}{14}\\\frac{9}{14}\\\frac{-3}{14}\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and

OUTPUT: LLL reduced basis

==Applications==
The LLL algorithm has found numerous other applications in [[MIMO]] detection algorithms &lt;ref&gt;Shahabuddin, Shahriar et al., "A Customized Lattice Reduction Multiprocessor for MIMO Detection", in Arxiv preprint, January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and cryptanalysis of [[public-key encryption]] schemes: [[Naccache-Stern knapsack cryptosystem|knapsack cryptosystems]], [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] with particular settings, [[NTRUEncrypt]], and so forth. The algorithm can be used to find integer solutions to many problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=D. Simon |title=Selected applications of LLL in number theory |journal=LLL+25 Conference |year=2007 |place=Caen, France |url=https://simond.users.lmno.cnrs.fr/maths/lll25_Simon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, the LLL algorithm forms a core of one of the [[integer relation algorithm]]s. For example, if it is believed that ''r''=1.618034 is a (slightly rounded) [[Root of a function|root]] to an unknown [[quadratic equation]] with integer coefficients, one may apply LLL reduction to the lattice in &lt;math&gt;R^4&lt;/math&gt; spanned by &lt;math&gt;[1,0,0,10000r^2], [0,1,0,10000r],&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[0,0,1,10000]&lt;/math&gt;. The first vector in the reduced basis will be an integer [[linear combination]] of these three, thus necessarily of the form &lt;math&gt;[a,b,c,10000(ar^2+br+c)]&lt;/math&gt;; but such a vector is "short" only if ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' are small and &lt;math&gt;ar^2+br+c&lt;/math&gt; is even smaller. Thus the first three entries of this short vector are likely to be the coefficients of the integral quadratic [[polynomial]] which has ''r'' as a root. In this example the LLL algorithm finds the shortest vector to be [1, -1, -1, 0.00025] and indeed &lt;math&gt;x^2-x-1&lt;/math&gt; has a root equal to the [[golden ratio]], 1.6180339887….

In [[mathematics]], the '''Manin conjecture''' describes the conjectural distribution of rational points on an [[algebraic variety]] relative to a suitable [[height function]]. It was proposed by [[Yuri I. Manin]] and his collaborators&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; in 1989 when they initiated a program with the aim of describing the distribution of rational points  on suitable algebraic varieties.

Their main conjecture is as follows.
Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; 
be a [[Fano variety]] defined
over a [[number field]] &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;,
let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;
be a height function which is relative to the [[Canonical bundle|anticanonical divisor]]
and assume that 
&lt;math&gt;V(K)&lt;/math&gt;
is [[Zariski topology|Zariski dense]] in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. 
Then there exists
a non-empty [[Zariski topology|Zariski open subset]] 
&lt;math&gt;U \subset V&lt;/math&gt;
such that the counting function

satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;N_{U,H}(B) \sim c B (\log B)^{\rho-1},&lt;/math&gt;
as &lt;math&gt;B \to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;
Here
&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;
is the rank of the [[Picard group]] of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;
is a positive constant which

A '''Markov partition''' is a tool used in [[dynamical systems]] theory, allowing the methods of  [[symbolic dynamics]] to be applied to the study of [[hyperbolic dynamics]].  By using a Markov partition, the system can be made to resemble a discrete-time [[Markov process]], with the long-term dynamical characteristics of the system represented as a [[Markov shift]].  The appellation 'Markov' is appropriate because the resulting dynamics of the system obeys the [[Markov property]]. The Markov partition thus allows standard techniques from [[symbolic dynamics]] to be applied, including the computation of [[expectation value]]s, [[correlation]]s, [[topological entropy]], [[topological zeta function]]s, [[Fredholm determinant]]s and the like.

== Motivation ==

Let (''M'',''φ'') be a discrete dynamical system. A basic method of studying its dynamics is to find a '''symbolic representation''': a faithful encoding of the points of ''M'' by sequences of symbols such that the map ''φ'' becomes the [[shift map]].

Suppose that ''M'' has been divided into a number of pieces ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''E''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;, which are thought to be as small and localized, with virtually no overlaps. The behavior of a point ''x'' under the iterates of ''φ'' can be tracked by recording, for each ''n'', the part ''E''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; which contains ''φ''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''). This results in an infinite sequence on the alphabet {1,2,…''r''} which encodes the point. In general, this encoding may be imprecise (the same sequence may represent many different points) and the set of sequences which arise in this way may be difficult to describe. Under certain conditions, which are made explicit in the rigorous definition of a Markov partition, the assignment of the sequence to a point of ''M'' becomes an almost one-to-one map whose image is a symbolic dynamical system of a special kind called a [[shift of finite type]]. In this case, the symbolic representation is a powerful tool for investigating the properties of the dynamical system (''M'',''&amp;phi;'').

== Formal definition==
A Markov partition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gaspard | first=Pierre | title=Chaos, scattering and statistical mechanics | series=Cambridge Nonlinear Science Series | volume=9 | location=Cambridge | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1998 | isbn=0-521-39511-9 | zbl=0915.00011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[finite cover]] of the [[invariant set]] of the manifold by a set of curvilinear rectangles &lt;math&gt;\{E_1, E_2, \ldots, E_r\}&lt;/math&gt; such that

* For any pair of points &lt;math&gt;x,y\in E_i&lt;/math&gt;, that &lt;math&gt;W_s(x)\cap W_u(y) \in E_i&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Int} E_i \cap \operatorname{Int} E_j=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i\ne j&lt;/math&gt;
* If &lt;math&gt;x\in \operatorname{Int} E_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)\in \operatorname{Int} E_j&lt;/math&gt;, then

::&lt;math&gt;\varphi\left[W_u(x)\cap E_i\right] \supset W_u(\varphi x) \cap E_j &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\varphi\left[W_s(x)\cap E_i\right] \subset W_s(\varphi x) \cap E_j &lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;W_u(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W_s(x)&lt;/math&gt; are the unstable and [[stable manifold]]s of ''x'', respectively, and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Int} E_i&lt;/math&gt; simply denotes the interior of &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt;. 
 
These last two conditions can be understood as a statement of the [[Markov property]] for the symbolic dynamics; that is, the movement of a trajectory from one open cover to the next is determined only by the most recent cover, and not the history of the system. It is this property of the covering that merits the 'Markov' appellation. The resulting dynamics is that of a [[Markov shift]]; that this is indeed the case is due to theorems by [[Yakov Sinai]] (1968)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Variants of the definition are found, corresponding to conditions on the geometry of the pieces &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=PF206&gt;Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.206&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Dynamical billiards]], in which case the covering is countable.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Markov partitions make [[homoclinic]] and [[heteroclinic orbit]]s particularly easy to describe.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The system &lt;math&gt;([0,1), x \mapsto 2x\ mod\ 1)&lt;/math&gt; has the Markov partition &lt;math&gt;E_0 = (0,1/2), E_1 = (1/2,1)&lt;/math&gt;, and in this case the symbolic representation of a real number in &lt;math&gt;[0,1)&lt;/math&gt; is its binary expansion. For example: &lt;math&gt;x \in E_0, Tx \in E_1, T^2x \in E_1, T^3x \in E_1, T^4x \in E_0 \Rightarrow x = (0.01110...)_2&lt;/math&gt;. The assignment of points of &lt;math&gt;[0,1)&lt;/math&gt; to their sequences in the Markov partition is well defined except on the dyadic rationals - morally speaking, this is because &lt;math&gt;(0.01111\dots)_2 = (0.10000\dots)_2&lt;/math&gt;, in the same way as &lt;math&gt; 1 = 0.999\dots&lt;/math&gt; in decimal expansions.

In [[statistics]], the '''method of support''' is a technique that is used to make inferences from datasets.

According to [[A. W. F. Edwards]], the method of support aims to make inferences about unknown parameters in terms of the relative support, or log [[likelihood]], induced by a set of data for a particular parameter value.  The technique may be used whether or not prior information is available.  

The [[method of maximum likelihood]] is part of the method of support, but note that the method of support also provides confidence regions that are defined in terms of their support.

Notable proponents of the method of support include [[A. W. F. Edwards]].

'''Moritz Benedikt Cantor''' (23 August 1829 – 10 April 1920) was a [[Germany|German]] [[History of mathematics|historian of mathematics]].

==Biography==
Cantor was born at [[Mannheim]]. He came from a family that had emigrated to the [[Netherlands]] from [[Portugal]], another branch of which had established itself in [[Russia]]. In his early youth, Moritz Cantor was not strong enough to go to school, and his parents decided to educate him at home. Later, however, he was admitted to an advanced class of the Gymnasium in Mannheim. From there he went to the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1848, and soon after to the [[University of Göttingen]], where he studied under [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] and [[Heinrich Martin Weber|Weber]], and where Stern awakened in him a strong interest in historical [[research]].

After obtaining his [[Ph.D.]] at the University of Heidelberg in 1851, he went to [[Berlin]], where he eagerly followed the lectures of [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]]; and upon his return to Heidelberg in 1853, he was appointed privat-docent at the university. In 1863, he was promoted to the position of assistant professor, and in 1877 he became honorary professor.

Cantor was one of the founders of the ''Kritische Zeitschrift für Chemie, Physik und Mathematik''. In 1859 he became associated with [[Schlömilch]] as editor of the ''Zeitschrift für Mathematik und Physik'', taking charge of the historical and literary section. Since 1877, through his efforts, a supplement to the ''Zeitschrift'' was published under the separate title of ''Abhandlungen zur Geschichte der Mathematik''.

Cantor's [[inaugural dissertation]], "Über ein weniger gebräuchliches Coordinaten-System" (1851), gave no indication that the history of exact sciences would soon be enriched by a master work by him. His first important work was "Über die Einführung unserer gegenwärtigen Ziffern in Europa", which he wrote for the ''Zeitschrift für Mathematik und Physik'', 1856, vol. i.

His greatest work was ''Vorlesungen über Geschichte der Mathematik''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, David Eugene|authorlink=David Eugene Smith|title=Review: ''Vorlesungen über Geschichte der Mathematik'', by Moritz Cantor|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|year=1909|volume=15|issue=7|pages=352–357|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1909-15-07/S0002-9904-1909-01781-1|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1909-01781-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comprehensive history of mathematics appeared as follows:
* Volume 1 (1880) - ''From the earliest times until 1200''
* Volume 2 (1892) - ''From 1200 to 1668''
* Volume 3 (1894-1896) - ''From 1668 to 1758''
* Volume 4 (1908) (with nine collaborators, Cantor as editor) - ''From 1759 to 1799''

Many historians credit him for founding a new discipline in a field that had hitherto lacked the sound, conscientious, and critical methods of other fields of history.

In 1900 Moritz Cantor received the honor of giving a [[list of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers|plenary address at the International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Paris]] (''Sur l'historiographie des mathématiques'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scott, Charlotte Angas|authorlink=Charlotte Angas Scott|title=The International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris|journal=Bull.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8136">'''Offset binary''',&lt;ref name="Patrice_2006"/&gt; also referred to as '''excess-K''',&lt;ref name="Patrice_2006"/&gt; '''excess-''N''''', '''excess code''' or '''biased representation''', is a digital coding scheme where all-zero corresponds to the minimal negative value and all-one to the [[Integer overflow|maximal positive value]]. There is no standard for offset binary, but most often the offset ''K'' for an ''n''-bit binary word is ''K''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;. This has the consequence that the "zero" value is represented by a 1 in the most significant bit and zero in all other bits, and in general the effect is conveniently the same as using [[two's complement]] except that the most significant bit is inverted. It also has the consequence that in a logical comparison operation, one gets the same result as with a two's complement numerical comparison operation, whereas, in two's complement notation a logical comparison will agree with two's complement numerical comparison operation if and only if the numbers being compared have the same sign. Otherwise the sense of the comparison will be inverted, with all negative values being taken as being larger than all positive values. 

{{anchor|Excess-64}}One historically prominent example of offset-64 (''excess-64'') notation was in the [[floating point]] (exponential) notation in the IBM System/360 and System/370 generations of computers. The "characteristic" (exponent) took the form of a seven-bit excess-64 number (The high-order bit of the same byte contained the sign of the [[significand]]).&lt;ref name="IBM_360"/&gt;

{{anchor|Excess-129}}The 8-bit exponent in [[Microsoft Binary Format]], a floating point format used in various programming languages (in particular [[BASIC]]) in the 1970s and 1980s, was encoded using an offset-129 notation (''excess-129'').

{{anchor|Excess-15|Excess-127|Excess-1023|Excess-16383}}The [[IEEE 754-2008|IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754)]] uses various sizes of exponent, but also uses offset notation for the format of each precision. Unusually however, instead of using "excess 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;" it uses "excess 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1" (i.e. ''excess-15'', ''excess-127'', ''excess-1023'', ''excess-16383'') which means that inverting the leading (high-order) bit of the exponent will not convert the exponent to correct two's complement notation. 

Offset binary is often used in [[digital signal processing]] (DSP). Most [[analog to digital converter|analog to digital]] (A/D) and [[digital to analog converter|digital to analog]] (D/A) chips are unipolar, which means that they cannot handle [[bipolar signal]]s (signals with both positive and negative values). A simple solution to this is to bias the analog signals with a DC offset equal to half of the A/D and D/A converter's range. The resulting digital data then ends up being in offset binary format.&lt;ref name="Chen_1988"/&gt;

Most standard computer CPU chips cannot handle the offset binary format directly. CPU chips typically can only handle signed and unsigned integers, and floating point value formats. Offset binary values can be handled in several ways by these CPU chips. The data may just be treated as unsigned integers, requiring the programmer to deal with the zero offset in software. The data may also be converted to signed integer format (which the CPU can handle natively) by simply subtracting the zero offset. As a consequence of the most common offset for an ''n''-bit word being 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;, which implies that the first bit is inverted relative to two's complement, there is no need for a separate subtraction step, but one simply can invert the first bit. This sometimes is a useful simplification in hardware, and can be convenient in software as well.

Offset binary may be converted into two's complement by inverting the most significant bit.  For example, with 8-bit values, the offset binary value may be XORed with 0x80 in order to convert to two's complement. In specialised hardware it may be simpler to accept the bit as it stands, but to apply its value in inverted significance.

In [[programming language theory]], the '''POPLmark challenge''' (from "Principles of Programming Languages benchmark", formerly '''Mechanized Metatheory for the Masses!''') (Aydemir, 2005) is a set of [[Benchmarking|benchmarks]] designed to evaluate the state of [[automated reasoning]] (or mechanization) in the [[metatheory]] of programming languages, and to stimulate discussion and collaboration among a diverse cross section of the [[formal methods]] community. Very loosely speaking, the challenge is about measurement of how well programs may be proven to match a specification of how they are intended to behave (and the many complex issues that this involves). The challenge was initially proposed by the members of the ''PL club'' at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], in association with collaborators around the world. The ''Workshop on Mechanized Metatheory'' is the main meeting of researchers participating in the challenge.

The design of the POPLmark benchmark is guided by features common to reasoning about programming languages. The challenge problems do not require the formalisation of large programming languages, but they do require sophistication in reasoning about:

; [[Name binding|Binding]] : Most programming languages have some form of binding, ranging in complexity from the simple binders of [[simply typed lambda calculus]] to complex, potentially infinite binders needed in the treatment of [[record (computer science)|record]] [[pattern matching|pattern]]s.
; [[Mathematical induction|Induction]] : Properties such as [[subject reduction]] and [[strong normalisation]] often require complex induction arguments.
; Reuse : Furthering collaboration being a key aim of the challenge, the solutions are expected to contain reusable components that would allow researchers to share language features and designs without requiring them to start from scratch every time.

== The problems ==

{{As of|2007}}, the POPLmark challenge is composed of three parts. Part 1 concerns solely the types of [[system F-sub|System F&lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;]] ([[System F]] with [[subtyping]]), and has problems such as:
# Checking that the type system admits [[transitive relation|transitivity]] of subtyping.
# Checking the transitivity of subtyping in the presence of [[record (computer science)|record]]s

Part 2 concerns the syntax and semantics of System F&lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;. It concerns proofs of
# [[Type safety]] for the pure fragment
# Type safety in the presence of [[pattern matching]]

Part 3 concerns the usability of the formalisation of System F&lt;sub&gt;&amp;lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;. In particular, the challenge asks for:
# Simulating and animating the [[operational semantics]]
# Extracting useful algorithms from the formalisations

Several solutions have been proposed for parts of the POPLmark challenge, using following tools: [[Isabelle theorem prover|Isabelle/HOL]], [[Twelf]], [[Coq]], [http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jcheney/programs/aprolog/ αProlog], [[ATS (programming language)|ATS]], [http://abella.cs.umn.edu/ Abella] and [[Matita proof assistant|Matita]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4045">In [[mathematical logic]], the '''Paris–Harrington theorem''' states that a certain [[combinatorial principle]] in [[Ramsey theory]], namely the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem, is true, but not provable in [[Peano arithmetic]]. This was the first "natural" example of a true statement about the integers that could be stated in the language of arithmetic, but not proved in Peano arithmetic; it was already known that such statements existed by [[Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]].

==Strengthened finite Ramsey theorem==
The strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is a statement about colorings and natural numbers and states that:
* For any positive integers ''n'', ''k'', ''m'' one can find ''N'' with the following property: if we color each of the ''n''-element subsets of ''S'' = {1, 2, 3,..., ''N''} with one of ''k'' colors, then we can find a subset ''Y'' of ''S'' with at least ''m'' elements, such that all ''n''-element subsets of ''Y'' have the same color, and the number of elements of ''Y'' is at least the smallest element of ''Y''.

Without the condition that the number of elements of ''Y'' is at least the smallest element of ''Y'', this is a corollary of the [[Ramsey's theorem|finite Ramsey theorem]] in &lt;math&gt;K_{\mathcal{P}_n(S)}&lt;/math&gt;, with ''N'' given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\binom{N}{n} = |\mathcal{P}_n(S)| \ge R(\,\underbrace{ m, m, \ldots , m }_k\,).&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem can be deduced from the [[Ramsey's theorem#Infinite Ramsey theorem|infinite Ramsey theorem]] in almost exactly the same way that the finite Ramsey theorem can be deduced from it, using a compactness argument (see the article on [[Ramsey's theorem]] for details). This proof can be carried out in [[second-order arithmetic]].

The Paris–Harrington theorem states that the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is not provable in [[Peano arithmetic]].

==Paris–Harrington theorem==
Roughly speaking, [[Jeff Paris (mathematician)|Jeff Paris]] and [[Leo Harrington]] (1972) showed that the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is unprovable in Peano arithmetic by showing that in Peano arithmetic it implies the consistency of Peano arithmetic itself. Since Peano arithmetic cannot prove its own consistency by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems#Second incompleteness theorem|Gödel's second incompleteness theorem]], this shows that Peano arithmetic cannot prove the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem.

The smallest number ''N'' that satisfies the strengthened finite Ramsey theorem is a [[computable function]] of ''n'', ''m'', ''k'', but grows extremely fast. In particular it is not [[primitive recursive function|primitive recursive]], but it is also far larger than standard examples of non-primitive recursive functions such as the [[Ackermann function]]. Its growth is so large that Peano arithmetic cannot prove it is defined everywhere, although Peano arithmetic easily proves that the Ackermann function is well defined.

In [[geometric graph theory]], a '''penny graph''' is a [[contact graph]] of [[unit circle]]s. That is, it is an [[undirected graph]] whose [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] can be represented by unit circles, with no two of these circles crossing each other, and with two adjacent vertices if and only if they are represented by [[tangent circles]].&lt;ref name="links"&gt;{{citation

Every penny graph is a [[unit disk graph]] and a [[matchstick graph]].
Like [[planar graph]]s more generally, they obey the [[four color theorem]], but this theorem is easier to prove for penny graphs.
Testing whether a graph is a penny graph, or finding its [[maximum independent set]], is [[NP-hard]]; however, both upper and lower bounds are known for the size of the maximum independent set.

==Computational complexity==
Constructing a penny graph from the locations of its {{mvar|n}} circles can be performed as an instance of the [[closest pair of points problem]], taking worst-case time {{math|''O''(''n'' log ''n'')}}&lt;ref name="rcv"/&gt; or (with randomized time and with the use of the [[floor function]]) expected time {{math|''O''(''n'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

An alternative method with the same worst-case time is to construct the [[Delaunay triangulation]] or [[nearest neighbor graph]] of the circle centers (both of which contain the penny graph as a subgraph)&lt;ref name="rcv"/&gt; and then test which edges correspond to circle tangencies.

However, testing whether a given graph is a penny graph is [[NP-hard]],&lt;ref name=ew96/&gt; even when the given graph is a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

[[File:Sierpinski Pascal triangle.svg|thumb|The [[Hanoi graph]] &lt;math&gt;H^5_3&lt;/math&gt; as a penny graph (the contact graph of the black disks)]]
Penny graphs are a special case of the [[Circle packing theorem|coin graphs]] (graphs that can be represented by tangencies of non-crossing circles of arbitrary radii).&lt;ref name="links"/&gt; Because the coin graphs are the same as the [[planar graph]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hartsfield|Ringel|2013}}, Theorem 8.4.2, p.&amp;nbsp;173.&lt;/ref&gt; all penny graphs are planar. The penny graphs are also [[unit disk graph]]s (the [[intersection graph]]s of unit circles), [[unit distance graph]]s (graphs that can be drawn with all edges having equal lengths, allowing crossings), and [[matchstick graph]]s (graphs that can be drawn in the plane with equal-length straight edges and no edge crossings).

The [[Hanoi graph]]s &lt;math&gt;H^n_3&lt;/math&gt; are penny graphs.

==Number of edges==
Every vertex in a penny graph has at most six neighboring vertices; here the number six is the [[Kissing number problem|kissing number]] for circles in the plane.
However, the pennies whose centers are less than three units from the [[convex hull]] of the pennies have fewer neighbors. Based on a more precise version of this argument, one can show
that every penny graph with {{mvar|n}} vertices has at most
:&lt;math&gt;\left\lfloor 3n - \sqrt{12n-3}\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
edges. Some penny graphs, formed by arranging the pennies in a [[Triangular tiling|triangular grid]], have exactly this number of edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=H.|last=Harborth|authorlink=Heiko Harborth|title=Lösung zu Problem 664A|journal=[[Elemente der Mathematik]]|volume=29|year=1974|pages=14–15}}.

==Coloring==
Every penny graph contains a vertex with at most three neighbors. For instance, such a vertex can be found at one of the corners of the [[convex hull]] of the circle centers, or as one of the two farthest-apart circle centers. Therefore, penny graphs have [[degeneracy (graph theory)|degeneracy]] at most three. Based on this, one can prove that their [[graph coloring]]s require at most four colors, much more easily than the proof of the more general [[four-color theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Pearls in Graph Theory: A Comprehensive Introduction|series=Dover Books on Mathematics|first1=Nora|last1=Hartsfield|first2=Gerhard|last2=Ringel|author2-link=Gerhard Ringel|publisher=Courier Corporation|year=2013|isbn=9780486315522|contribution=Problem 8.4.8|pages=177–178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VMjDAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, despite their restricted structure, there exist penny graphs that do still require four colors.

[[File:Triangle-free penny graph.jpg|thumb|A [[triangle-free graph|triangle-free]] penny graph with the property that all the pennies on the convex hull touch at least three other pennies]]
Analogously, the degeneracy of every triangle-free penny graph is at most two. Every such graph contains a vertex with at most two neighbors, even though it is not always possible to find this vertex on the convex hull. Based on this one can prove that they require at most three colors, more easily than the proof of the more general [[Grötzsch's theorem]] that triangle-free planar graphs are 3-colorable.&lt;ref name=eppstein/&gt;

==Independent sets==
A [[maximum independent set]] in a penny graph is a subset of the pennies, no two of which touch each other. Finding maximum independent sets is [[NP-hard]] for arbitrary graphs, and remains [[NP-hard]] on penny graphs.&lt;ref name="cffp"/&gt; It is an instance of the [[maximum disjoint set]] problem, in which one must find large subsets of non-overlapping regions of the plane. However, as with planar graphs more generally, [[Baker's technique]] provides a [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]] for this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In 1983, [[Paul Erdős]] asked for the largest number {{mvar|c}} such that every {{mvar|n}}-vertex penny graph has an independent set of at least {{mvar|cn}} vertices.&lt;ref name="pt96"/&gt; That is, if we place {{mvar|n}} pennies on a flat surface, there should be a subset of {{mvar|cn}} of the pennies that don't touch each other. By the four-color theorem, {{math|''c'' ≥ 1/4}}, and the improved bound {{math|''c'' ≥ 8/31 ≈ 0.258}} was proven by Swanepoel.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1115">In [[mathematical analysis]], a '''positively invariant set''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] with the following properties:

Given a [[dynamical system]] &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and [[trajectory]] &lt;math&gt; x(t,x_0) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; x_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the initial point. Let &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{O} \triangleq \left \lbrace x \in \mathbb{R}^n| \phi (x) = 0 \right \rbrace&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a real valued [[Function (mathematics)|function]]. The set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be positively invariant if &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in \mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;x(t,x_0) \in \mathcal{O} \ \forall \ t \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, this means that once a trajectory of the system enters &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;, it will never leave it again.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4767">In [[graph theory]], a '''quotient graph''' ''Q'' of a graph ''G'' is a graph whose vertices are blocks of a [[partition of a set|partition]] of the vertices of ''G'' and where block ''B'' is adjacent to block ''C'' if some vertex in ''B'' is adjacent to some vertex in ''C'' with respect to the edge set of ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

More formally, a quotient graph is a [[quotient object]] in the [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of graphs. The category of graphs is [[concretizable]] – mapping a graph to its set of vertices makes it a [[concrete category]] – so its objects can be regarded as "sets with additional structure", and a quotient graph corresponds to the graph induced on the [[quotient set]] ''V''/''R'' of its vertex set ''V''. Further, there is a [[graph homomorphism]] (a [[quotient map]]) from a graph to a quotient graph, sending each vertex or edge to the equivalence class that it belongs to. Intuitively, this corresponds to "gluing together" (formally, "identifying") vertices and edges of the graph.

==Examples==
A graph is trivially a quotient graph of itself (each block of the partition is a single vertex), and the graph consisting of a single point is the quotient graph of any non-empty graph (the partition consisting of a single block of all vertices). The simplest non-trivial quotient graph is one obtained by identifying two vertices ([[vertex identification]]); if the vertices are connected, this is called [[edge contraction]].

==Special types of quotient==
[[File:Graph Condensation.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|A directed graph (blue and black) and its condensation (yellow). The strongly connected components (subsets of blue vertices within each yellow vertex) form the blocks of a partition giving rise to the quotient.]]
The [[condensation (graph theory)|condensation]] of a directed graph is the quotient graph where the [[strongly connected component]]s form the blocks of the partition. This construction can be used to derive a [[directed acyclic graph]] from any directed graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=Formal Methods in System Design|date=January 2006|volume=28|issue=1|pages=37–56|title=An algorithm for strongly connected component analysis in ''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'' symbolic steps|first1=Roderick|last1=Bloem|first2=Harold N.|last2=Gabow|first3=Fabio|last3=Somenzi|doi=10.1007/s10703-006-4341-z}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of one or more [[edge contraction]]s in an undirected graph ''G'' is a quotient of ''G'', in which the blocks are the [[Connected component (graph theory)|connected component]]s of the subgraph of ''G'' formed by the contracted edges. However, for quotients more generally, the blocks of the partition giving rise to the quotient do not need to form connected subgraphs.

If ''G'' is a [[covering graph]] of another graph ''H'', then ''H'' is a quotient graph of ''G''. The blocks of the corresponding partition are the inverse images of the vertices of ''H'' under the covering map. However, covering maps have an additional requirement that is not true more generally of quotients, that the map be a local isomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Computational complexity==
It is [[NP-complete]], given an {{mvar|n}}-vertex [[cubic graph]] ''G'' and a parameter {{mvar|k}}, to determine whether ''G'' can be obtained as a quotient of a [[planar graph]] with {{math|''n'' + ''k''}} vertices.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Renu Chakravarti Laskar''' (born 1932) is an [[India]]n-born American mathematician, specializing in [[graph theory]]. She is Professor Emerita of Mathematical sciences at [[Clemson University]]. She received her Ph.D. in Mathematics from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=4069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laskar has often contributed to the theory of [[domination number]] and [[circular arc graph]]s. She wrote four papers with [[Paul Erdős]], giving her an [[Erdős number]] of 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oakland.edu/enp/|title=Erdös Number Project - The Erdös Number Project- Oakland University|work=oakland.edu|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education==
Renu C. Laskar was born in [[Bihar]], [[India]]. With the help of her family support, she finished her schooling and college, which wasn't much accessible to the women that time due to the cultural norms prevalent in India. It was during that time, when she discovered her talent for mathematics. She finished her Master's degree in Mathematics from [[B. R. Ambedkar Bihar University]] in the year 1955. Upon finishing college, Laskar, with strong encouragement from her elder brother, decided to come to the United States to pursue her Ph.D. in the year 1958. She worked for her Ph.D. degree at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] under her advisor [[Henry Roy Brahana]] and received her degree in the year 1962. She is the first female Indian to receive a Ph.D. in Mathematics from UIUC. She returned to India after that and joined the [[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur]] as the first woman faculty at the institute. After three years, Laskar then moved back to the US at [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and then finally joined [[Clemson University]] in the year 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/programs/essay-contest/contest-rules/essay-contest-past-results/essays/renulaskarchangingobstaclesintoopportunities|title=Renu Laskar: Changing Obstacles into Opportunities - AWM Association for Women in Mathematics|work=google.com|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic life==
Laskar took full advantage of the opportunities she had and set new standards for women in mathematics. She ranks among the top women in discrete mathematics in the number of articles published. According to MathSciNet, she has over 100 publications. Part of the reason for her success in this area is her collaboration network, which included [[Raj Chandra Bose]] and  [[Paul Erdős]]. She has extended her influence by supervising Ph.D. students. In 1986, Laskar and Steve Hedetniemi organized the Clemson University Discrete Math Miniconference, an event that has drawn an international audience each year since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/math/history/mthsc2.html|title=History of Mathematical Sciences at Clemson University|work=clemson.edu|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Courant''' (January 8, 1888 – January 27, 1972) was a [[German American]] [[mathematician]]. He is best known by the general public for the book ''[[What is Mathematics?]]'', co-written with [[Herbert Robbins]]. 

==Life and career==

Courant was born in [[Lubliniec|Lublinitz]], in the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Province of Silesia]]. His parents were Siegmund Courant and Martha Courant née Freund of [[Oels]]. [[Edith Stein]] was Richard's cousin on the paternal side. During his youth his parents moved often, including to [[Kłodzko|Glatz]], then to [[Wrocław|Breslau]] and in 1905 to [[Berlin]]. He stayed in Breslau and entered the [[University of Wrocław|university]] there, then continued his studies at the [[University of Zürich]] and the [[University of Göttingen]]. He became [[David Hilbert]]'s assistant in Göttingen and obtained his doctorate there in 1910. He was obliged to serve in [[World War I]], but was wounded shortly after enlisting and therefore dismissed from the military. Courant left the [[University of Münster]] in 1921 to take over [[Erich Hecke]]{{'}}s position at the [[University of Göttingen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media| isbn = 978-3-642-22464-5| last = Bergmann| first = Birgit| title = Transcending Tradition: Jewish Mathematicians in German Speaking Academic Culture| date = 2012-10-22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7z8DTwXGO-oC&amp;pg=PA82}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he founded the Mathematical Institute, which he headed as director from 1928 until 1933.

Courant left [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in 1933, earlier than many Jewish escapees. He did not lose his position due to being [[Jewish]], as his previous service as a front-line soldier exempted him; however, his public membership in the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|social-democratic left]] was reason enough (for the Nazis) for dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|

In 1936, after one year at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], Courant accepted a professorship at [[New York University]] in New York City. There he founded an institute for graduate studies in [[applied mathematics]]. The [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]] (as it was renamed in 1964) is now one of the most respected research centers in applied mathematics.{{Citation needed|reason=unclear justification|date=October 2018}}

Courant and [[David Hilbert]] authored the influential [[textbook]] ''[[Methoden der mathematischen Physik]]'' which, with its revised editions, is still current and widely used since its publication in 1924. With [[Herbert Robbins]] he coauthored a popular overview of higher mathematics, intended for the general public, titled ''[[What is Mathematics?]]''. With [[Fritz John]] he also coauthored the two-volume work ''Introduction to Calculus and Analysis,'' first published in 1965.

Courant's name is also attached to the [[finite element method]],&lt;ref name=G.Pelosi&gt;{{cite web|title=The finite-element method, Part I: R. L. Courant: Historical Corner|author=Giuseppe Pelosi|year=2007|doi=10.1109/MAP.2007.376627}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his numerical treatment of the plain torsion problem for multiply-connected domains, published in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;

This method is now one of the ways to solve [[partial differential equation]]s [[numerical analysis|numerically]]. Courant is a namesake of the [[Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy condition]] and the [[Courant minimax principle]].

Courant died of a [[stroke]] in [[New Rochelle, New York]] on January 27th, 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0713FD3B591A7493CBAB178AD85F468785F9 NY Times Obituary "Dr. Richard Courant Dies at 84; Influential Mathematics Scholar; Organizer and Ex. Direcgor of Institute at N.Y.U. Aided Research and Teaching"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspective on mathematics==

Commenting upon his analysis of experimental results from in-laboratory soap film formations, Courant believed that the existence of a physical solution does not obviate mathematical proof. Here is a quote from Courant on his mathematical perspective:

{{quote|Empirical evidence can never establish mathematical existence--nor can the mathematician's demand for existence be dismissed by the physicist as useless rigor. Only a mathematical existence proof can ensure that the mathematical description of a physical phenomenon is meaningful.&lt;ref&gt;''The Parsimonious Universe'', Stefan Hildebrandt &amp; Anthony Tromba, Springer-Verlag, 1996, page 148&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Personal life==

In 1912 Courant married [[Nelly Neumann]], who had earned her doctorate at Breslau in Synthetic Geometry in 1909.  They lived together in Göttingen until they were divorced in 1916.  She was later murdered by the Nazis in 1942 for being Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/neumann-nelly | title = Nelly Neumann | publisher = Jewish Women's Archive | date = 1 March 2009 | accessdate = 7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 Courant married Nerina (Nina) Runge (1891-1991), a daughter of the Göttingen professor for Applied Mathematics, [[Carl Runge]] (of [[Runge-Kutta]] fame).

Richard and Nerina had four children: [[Ernest Courant|Ernest]], a [[Particle physics|particle physicist]] and innovator in particle accelerators; Gertrude (1922-2014), a PhD biologist and wife of the mathematician [[Jürgen Moser]] (1928–1999); [[Hans Courant|Hans]], a physicist who participated in the [[Manhattan Project]]; and Leonore (known as "Lori," 1928-2015), a professional violist and wife of the mathematician Jerome Berkowitz (1928–1998).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1852">In [[mathematics]], the '''Riemann–von Mangoldt formula''', named for [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[Hans Carl Friedrich von Mangoldt]], describes the distribution of the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]].

The formula states that the number ''N''(''T'') of zeros of the zeta function with imaginary part greater than 0 and less than or equal to ''T'' satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;N(T)=\frac{T}{2\pi}\log{\frac{T}{2\pi}}-\frac{T}{2\pi}+O(\log{T}).&lt;/math&gt;

The formula was stated by Riemann in his notable paper "[[On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude]]" (1859) and was finally proved by Mangoldt in 1905.

Backlund gives an explicit form of the error for all ''T'' greater than 2:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\vert{ N(T) - \left({\frac{T}{2\pi}\log{\frac{T}{2\pi}}-\frac{T}{2\pi} } - \frac{7}{8}\right)}\right\vert &lt; 0.137 \log T + 0.443  \log\log T + 4.350 \ . &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Saddle_Point_between_maxima.svg|thumb|300px|right|Saddle point between two hills (the intersection of the figure-eight &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-contour)]]
In [[mathematics]], a '''saddle point''' or '''minimax point'''&lt;ref&gt;Howard Anton, Irl Bivens, Stephen Davis (2002): ''Calculus, Multivariable Version'', p. 844&lt;/ref&gt; is a point on the [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] of the [[graph of a function|graph]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] where the slopes (derivatives) in orthogonal directions are all zero (a [[Critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]), but which is not a [[local extremum]] of the function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chiang |first=Alpha C. |title=Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |edition=3rd |year=1984 |isbn=0-07-010813-7 |page=312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a saddle point shown on the right is when there is a critical point with a relative [[minimum]] along one axial direction (between peaks) and at a [[maxima and minima|relative maximum]] along the crossing axis.  However, a saddle point need not be in this form.  For example, the function &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = x^2 + y^3&lt;/math&gt; has a critical point at &lt;math&gt;(0, 0)&lt;/math&gt; that is a saddle point since it is neither a relative maximum nor relative minimum, but it does not have a relative maximum or relative minimum in the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-direction.
 
The name derives from the fact that the prototypical example in two dimensions is a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] that ''curves up'' in one direction, and ''curves down'' in a different direction, resembling a riding [[saddle]] or a [[mountain pass]] between two peaks forming a [[Saddle (landform)|landform saddle]]. In terms of [[contour line]]s, a saddle point in two dimensions gives rise to a contour graph or trace in which the contour corresponding to the saddle point's value appears to intersect itself.

== Mathematical discussion ==

A simple criterion for checking if a given stationary point of a real-valued function ''F''(''x'',''y'') of two real variables is a saddle point is to compute the function's [[Hessian matrix]] at that point: if the Hessian is [[Positive-definite matrix#Indefinite|indefinite]], then that point is a saddle point. For example, the Hessian matrix of the function &lt;math&gt;z=x^2-y^2&lt;/math&gt; at the stationary point &lt;math&gt;(x, y, z)=(0, 0, 0)&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
2 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; -2 \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
which is indefinite. Therefore, this point is a saddle point. This criterion gives only a sufficient condition. For example, the point &lt;math&gt;(0, 0, 0)&lt;/math&gt; is a saddle point for the function &lt;math&gt;z=x^4-y^4,&lt;/math&gt; but the Hessian matrix of this function at the origin is the null matrix, which is not indefinite.

In the most general terms, a '''saddle point''' for a [[smooth function]] (whose [[graph of a function|graph]] is a [[curve]], [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] or [[hypersurface]]) is a stationary point such that the curve/surface/etc. in the [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of that point is not entirely on any side of the [[tangent space]] at that point.
[[File:x cubed plot.svg|thumb|150px|The plot of ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with a saddle point at 0]]

In a domain of one dimension, a saddle point is a [[Point (geometry)|point]] which is both a [[stationary point]] and a [[Inflection point|point of inflection]]. Since it is a point of inflection, it is not a [[local extremum]].

== Saddle surface {{anchor|Surface}} ==
[[Image:HyperbolicParaboloid.svg|thumb|right|[[Hyperbolic paraboloid]]]]
[[Image:Ruled hyperboloid.jpg|thumb|right|A model of an [[elliptic hyperboloid]] of one sheet]]
[[Image:Monkey_saddle_surface.svg|thumb|right|A [[monkey saddle]]|300px]]

A '''saddle surface''' is a [[smooth surface]] containing one or more saddle points.

Classical examples of two-dimensional saddle surfaces in the [[Euclidean space]] are second order surfaces, the [[hyperbolic paraboloid]] &lt;math&gt;z=x^2-y^2&lt;/math&gt; (which is often referred to as "''the'' saddle surface" or "the standard saddle surface") and the [[hyperboloid of one sheet]]. The [[Pringles]] potato chip or crisp is an everyday example of a hyperbolic paraboloid shape.

Saddle surfaces have negative [[Gaussian curvature]] which distinguish them from convex/elliptical surfaces which have positive Gaussian curvature. A classical third-order saddle surface is the [[monkey saddle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. Creighton |last=Buck |year=2003 |title=Advanced Calculus |location=	Long Grove, IL |publisher=Waveland Press |edition=Third |isbn=1-57766-302-0 |page=160 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7cYQAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

In a two-player [[zero-sum (game theory)|zero sum]] game defined on a continuous space, the [[Nash equilibrium|equilibrium]] point is a saddle point.

For a second-order linear autonomous system, a [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]] is a saddle point if the [[Characteristic equation (calculus)|characteristic equation]] has one positive and one negative real eigenvalue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von Petersdorff|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In optimization subject to equality constraints, the first-order conditions describe a saddle point of the [[Lagrange multiplier|Lagrangian]].

== Other uses ==

In [[dynamical systems]], if the dynamic is given by a [[differentiable map]] ''f'' then a point is hyperbolic if and only if the differential of ''&amp;fnof;'' &lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (where ''n'' is the period of the point) has no eigenvalue on the (complex) [[unit circle]] when computed at the point. Then
a ''saddle point'' is a hyperbolic [[periodic point]] whose [[stable manifold|stable]] and [[unstable manifold]]s have a [[dimension]] that is not zero.

A saddle point of a matrix is an element which is both the largest element in its column and the smallest element in its row.

In [[computational geometry]], a '''Steiner point''' is a point that is not part of the input to a geometric optimization problem but is added during the solution of the problem, to create a better solution than would be possible from the original points alone.

The name of these points comes from the [[Steiner tree problem]], named after [[Jakob Steiner]], in which the goal is to connect the input points by a network of minimum total length. If the input points alone are used as endpoints of the network edges, then the shortest network is their [[minimum spanning tree]]. However, shorter networks can often be obtained by adding Steiner points,
and using both the new points and the input points as edge endpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Another problem that uses Steiner points is [[Steiner triangulation]]. The goal is to partition an input (such as a point set or polygon) into triangles, meeting edge-to-edge. Both input points and Steiner points may be used as triangle vertices.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications|edition=2nd|first1=Mark|last1=de Berg|first2=Marc|last2=van Kreveld|first3=Mark|last3=Overmars|first4=Otfried|last4=Schwarzkopf|publisher=Springer|year=2000|isbn=9783540656203|page=293|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8zaAWuOIOcC&amp;pg=PA293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42821">In [[functional analysis]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], '''stereotype spaces''' are [[topological vector space]]s defined by a special variant of [[Reflexive space|reflexivity]] condition. They form a class of spaces with a series of remarkable properties, in particular, this class is very wide (for instance, it contains all [[Fréchet space]]s and thus, all [[Banach space]]s), it consists of spaces satisfying a natural condition of completeness, and it forms a [[*-autonomous category]] with the standard analytical tools for constructing new spaces, like taking dual space, space of operators, tensor products, and in addition, immediate subspace, immediate quotient space, products and coproducts, limits and colimits, etc. 
[[File:Stereotype spaces -2 .jpg|thumb|Mutual embeddings of the main classes of locally convex spaces.]]

==Definition==

A '''stereotype space'''{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=219}} is a [[topological vector space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; over the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; of complex numbers&lt;ref&gt;...or over the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers, with the similar definition.&lt;/ref&gt; such that the natural map into the second dual space

:&lt;math&gt; i:X\to X^{\star\star},\quad i(x)(f)=f(x),\quad x\in X,\quad f\in X^\star &lt;/math&gt;

is an isomorphism of topological vector spaces (i.e. a [[Linear map|linear]] and a [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] map). Here the ''dual space'' &lt;math&gt; X^\star&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the space of all linear continuous functionals &lt;math&gt;f:X\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on [[Totally bounded space#Definitions in other contexts|totally bounded set]]s in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and the ''second dual space'' &lt;math&gt; X^{\star\star}&lt;/math&gt; is the space dual to &lt;math&gt; X^{\star}&lt;/math&gt; in the same sense.

The following criterion holds:{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=219, 220}} a topological vector space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is stereotype if and only if it is [[Locally convex space|locally convex]] and satisfies the following two conditions:

:* ''pseudocompleteness'': each [[Totally bounded set|totally bounded]] [[Net (mathematics)#Cauchy nets|Cauchy net]] in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; converges,
:*
:* ''pseudosaturateness'': each closed convex balanced ''capacious''&lt;ref&gt;A set &lt;math&gt;D\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''capacious'' if for each [[Totally bounded set|totally bounded]] set &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; there is a finite set &lt;math&gt;F\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq D+F&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; set &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a neighborhood of zero in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

The property of being pseudocomplete is a weakening of the usual notion of completeness, while the property of being pseudosaturated is a weakening of the notion of [[Barreled space|barreledness]] of a topological vector space.

==Examples==
The class '''Ste''' of stereotype spaces is extremely wide, so that it will not be a serious exaggeration to say that all topological vector spaces really used in analysis are stereotype.{{sfn|Akbarov|2005}} Each pseudocomplete [[barreled space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (in particular, each [[Banach space]] and each [[Fréchet space]]) is stereotype. Its dual space &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; (which is not barreled, unless &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Montel space]]) is stereotype as well&lt;ref&gt;Of course, this is a general fact: if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is stereotype then &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; is also stereotype.&lt;/ref&gt;. There exist stereotype spaces which are not [[Mackey space]]s.

Some simple connections between the properties of a stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and those of its dual space &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; are expressed in the following list of regularities:{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=221}}

:* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[normed space]] &lt;math&gt;\Longleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Banach space]] &lt;math&gt;\Longleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Smith space]];

:* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is [[Metrization theorem|metrizable]] &lt;math&gt;\Longleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Fréchet space]] &lt;math&gt;\Longleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Brauner space]];

:* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is [[barreled space|barreled]] &lt;math&gt;\Longleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; has the [[Heine-Borel theorem#In the theory of topological vector spaces|Heine-Borel property]];

:* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is [[Barrelled space#Quasi-barrelled spaces|quasi-barreled]] &lt;math&gt;\Longleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; if a set &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is absorbed by each barrel, then &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is totally bounded;

:* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Mackey space]] &lt;math&gt;\Longleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; every &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;-weakly compact set is compact;

:* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Montel space]] &lt;math&gt;\Longleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is barreled and has the [[Heine-Borel theorem#In the theory of topological vector spaces|Heine-Borel property]] &lt;math&gt;\Longleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt;  is a Montel space;

:* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a space with a [[weak topology]] &lt;math&gt;\Longleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; every compact set &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is finite-dimensional;

:* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is [[separable space|separable]] &lt;math&gt;\Longleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; there is a sequence of closed subspaces &lt;math&gt;L_n&lt;/math&gt; of finite co-dimension with trivial intersection: &lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}L_n=\{0\}&lt;/math&gt;.

:* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has the (classical) [[approximation property]] &lt;math&gt;\Longleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; has the (classical) [[approximation property]];

:* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is [[Uniform space|complete]] &lt;math&gt;\Longleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; is co-complete&lt;ref&gt;A locally convex space  &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called ''co-complete'' if each linear functional &lt;math&gt;f:X\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; which is continuous on every totally bounded set &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;, is automatically continuous on the whole space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\Longleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; is saturated;&lt;ref&gt;A locally convex space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''saturated'' if for an absolutely convex set &lt;math&gt;B\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; being a neighbourhood of zero in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the following: for each totally bounded set  &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; there is a closed neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;B\cap S=U&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

:* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a Pták space&lt;ref&gt;A locally convex space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''Pták space'', or a ''fully complete space'', if in its dual space  &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; a subspace &lt;math&gt;Q\subseteq X^\star&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;-weakly closed when it has &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;-weakly closed intersection with the polar &lt;math&gt;U^\circ&lt;/math&gt; of each neighbourhood of zero &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;\Longleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; a subspace &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is closed if it has the closed intersection &lt;math&gt;L\cap K&lt;/math&gt; with each compact set &lt;math&gt;K\subseteq X^\star&lt;/math&gt;;

:* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is hypercomplete&lt;ref&gt;A locally convex space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''hypercomplete'' if in its dual space &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; every absolutely convex space &lt;math&gt;Q\subseteq X^\star&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;-weakly closed if it  has &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;-weakly closed intersection with the polar &lt;math&gt;U^\circ&lt;/math&gt; of each neighbourhood of zero  &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;\Longleftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; an absolutely convex set  &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is closed if it has the closed intersection &lt;math&gt;B\cap K&lt;/math&gt; with each compact set &lt;math&gt;K\subseteq X^\star&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Counterexamples:''' 
# If a metrizable locally convex space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is not complete, then it is not stereotype. 
# Each infinite dimensional normed space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; considered with the &lt;math&gt;X^{\star}&lt;/math&gt;-weak topology is not stereotype.

==History==

The first results on this type of reflexivity of topological vector spaces were obtained by M. F. Smith{{sfn|Smith|1952}}{{sfn|Onishchik|1984}} in 1952. Further investigations were conducted by B. S. Brudovskii,
{{sfn|Brudovski|1967}} W. C. Waterhouse,{{sfn|Waterhouse|1968}} K. Brauner,{{sfn|Brauner|1973}} S. S. Akbarov,{{sfn|Akbarov|2003}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2009}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2016}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2017}} and E. T. Shavgulidze.{{sfn|Akbarov|Shavgulidze|2003}} The term "stereotype space" was introduced by S. S. Akbarov in 1995{{sfn|Akbarov|1995}}. The main properties of the category of stereotype spaces were described by S. S. Akbarov in his series of works of 1995-2017.

==Pseudocompletion and pseudosaturation==

Each [[locally convex space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; can be transformed into a stereotype space with the help of two standard operations, pseudocompletion and pseudosaturation, defined by the following two propositions.{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=197, 200}}

1. With any locally convex space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, one can associate a linear continuous map &lt;math&gt;\triangledown_X: X\to X^\triangledown&lt;/math&gt; into some pseudocomplete locally convex space &lt;math&gt;X^\triangledown&lt;/math&gt;, called ''pseudocompletion'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, in such a way that the following conditions are fulfilled:
:* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is pseudocomplete if and only if &lt;math&gt;\triangledown_X: X\to X^\triangledown&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism;
:* for any linear continuous map &lt;math&gt;\varphi:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; of locally convex spaces, there exists a unique linear continuous map &lt;math&gt;\varphi^\triangledown:X^\triangledown\to Y^\triangledown&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\triangledown_Y\circ\varphi=\varphi^\triangledown\circ\triangledown_X&lt;/math&gt;.

One can imagine the pseudocompletion of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as the "nearest to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; from the outside" pseudocomplete locally convex space, so that the operation &lt;math&gt;X\mapsto X^\triangledown&lt;/math&gt; adds to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; some supplementary elements, but does not change the topology of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (like the usual operation of completion).

2. With any locally convex space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, one can associate a linear continuous map &lt;math&gt;\vartriangle_X:X^\vartriangle\to X&lt;/math&gt; from some pseudosaturated locally convex space &lt;math&gt;X^\vartriangle&lt;/math&gt;, called ''pseudosaturation'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, in such a way that the following conditions are fulfilled:
:* &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is pseudosaturated if and only if &lt;math&gt;\vartriangle_X:X^\vartriangle\to X&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism;
:* for any linear continuous map &lt;math&gt;\varphi:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; of locally convex spaces, there exists a unique linear continuous map &lt;math&gt;\varphi^\vartriangle:X^\vartriangle\to Y^\vartriangle&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi\ \circ\vartriangle_X=\vartriangle_Y\circ\ \varphi^\vartriangle&lt;/math&gt;.

The pseudosaturation of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; can be imagined as the "nearest to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; from the inside" pseudosaturated locally convex space, so that the operation &lt;math&gt;X\mapsto X^\vartriangle&lt;/math&gt; strengthens the topology of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, but does not change the elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a pseudocomplete locally convex space, then its pseudosaturation &lt;math&gt;X^\vartriangle&lt;/math&gt; is stereotype. Dually, if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a pseudosaturated locally convex space, then its pseudocompletion &lt;math&gt;X^\triangledown&lt;/math&gt;  is stereotype. For arbitrary locally convex space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; the spaces  &lt;math&gt;X^{\vartriangle\triangledown}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X^{\triangledown\vartriangle}&lt;/math&gt; are stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;It is not clear (2017) whether &lt;math&gt;X^{\vartriangle\triangledown}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X^{\triangledown\vartriangle}&lt;/math&gt; coincide.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immediate subspaces and immediate quotient spaces==
The idea of subspace (and of quotient space) in stereotype theory leads to more complicated results than in the theory of locally convex spaces.

===Immediate subspaces and envelopes===
The notion of immediate subspace gives a "concrete description" of the abstract notion of ''immediate monomorphism''&lt;ref&gt;A [[monomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''immediate'' if in each representation &lt;math&gt;\mu=\mu'\circ\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mu'&lt;/math&gt; is a monomorphism and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is an [[epimorphism]], the morphism &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is automatically an [[isomorphism]].&lt;/ref&gt;, or, what is equivalent in this situation{{sfn|Akbarov|2016|p=39}}, [[strong monomorphism]] in the category '''Ste'''. Surprisingly, this description does not coincide with the construction of closed subspace in the category '''LocConv''' of locally convex spaces.

* Suppose &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is a subset in a stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; endowed with a structure of a stereotype space in such a way that the set-theoretic inclusion &lt;math&gt;Y\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism of stereotype spaces (i.e. a continuous linear map). Then &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''subspace'' of the stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, with the notation

:&lt;math&gt;Y\hookrightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;.

* Suppose we have a chain of stereotype subspaces 

:&lt;math&gt;Z\hookrightarrow Y\hookrightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;,

:and the first mapping &lt;math&gt;Z\hookrightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; is a bimorphism of stereotype spaces. Then the space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''mediator of the subspace &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;''.

* A subspace &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in a stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''immediate subspace'' in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;,  with the notation
:&lt;math&gt;Z\overset{\circ}{\hookrightarrow} X&lt;/math&gt;,
:if it has no non-trivial mediators, i.e. for any mediator &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; the inclusion &lt;math&gt;Z\hookrightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism.

'''Examples:'''
# An immediate subspace &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; in a stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''closed'', if &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; (as a set) is closed in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (as a topological space). If &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is a closed subspace in a stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (as in a locally convex space), then its pseudosaturation &lt;math&gt;Z=Y^\vartriangle&lt;/math&gt; is a closed immediate subspace in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

===Immediate quotient spaces and refinements===
Dually, the notion of immediate quotient space gives a "concrete description" of the abstract notion of ''immediate epimorphism''&lt;ref&gt;An [[epimorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''immediate'' if in each representation &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon=\mu\circ\varepsilon'&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a [[monomorphism]] and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon'&lt;/math&gt; is an epimorphism, the morphism &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is automatically an [[isomorphism]].&lt;/ref&gt;, or, what is equivalent here{{sfn|Akbarov|2016|p=39}}, [[strong epimorphism]]  in the category '''Ste'''. Like in the situation with monomorphisms, this description does not coincide with the construction of quotient space in the category '''LocConv''' of locally convex spaces.

* Let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be a closed subspace (in the usual sense) in a stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Consider a topology &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; on the quotient space &lt;math&gt;X/E&lt;/math&gt;, which is majorized by the usual quotient topology of &lt;math&gt;X/E&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;(X/E)^\blacktriangledown&lt;/math&gt; be a completion of &lt;math&gt;X/E&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the topology &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is a subset in the locally convex space &lt;math&gt;(X/E)^\blacktriangledown&lt;/math&gt; which contains &lt;math&gt;X/E&lt;/math&gt; and at the same time is a stereotype space. Then &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''quotient space'' of the stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;,  with the notation

:&lt;math&gt;X\rightarrowtail Y&lt;/math&gt;.

* Suppose we have two quotient spaces &lt;math&gt;X\rightarrowtail Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; X\rightarrowtail Z&lt;/math&gt;. It is said that the &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; ''subordinates'' &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; (notation: &lt;math&gt;Y\ge Z&lt;/math&gt;) if there is a morphism &lt;math&gt;\varkappa:Y\to Z&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\upsilon_Z=\varkappa\circ\upsilon_Y&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\upsilon_Z:X\to Z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\upsilon_Y:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; are the natural mappings).

* Suppose that the quotient space &lt;math&gt;X\rightarrowtail Y&lt;/math&gt; subordinates the quotient space &lt;math&gt; X\rightarrowtail Z&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;Y\ge Z&lt;/math&gt;) and the corresponding morphism &lt;math&gt;\varkappa:Y\to Z&lt;/math&gt; is a bimorphism. Then the quotient space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''mediator of the quotient space &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; of the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;''.

* A quotient space &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; of a stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''immediate quotient space'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, with the notation
:&lt;math&gt;X\overset{\circ}{\rightarrowtail} Z&lt;/math&gt;,
:if it has no non-trivial mediators, i.e. for any mediator &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; the morphism &lt;math&gt;\varkappa:Y\to Z&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism.

'''Examples:'''
# An immediate quotient space &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; of a stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''open'', if the corresponding map &lt;math&gt;X\to Z&lt;/math&gt; is open&lt;ref&gt;A linear map &lt;math&gt;\varphi:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''open'', if for each neighborhood of zero &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; there is a neighborhood of zero &lt;math&gt;V\subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\varphi(U)\supseteq V\cap\varphi(X)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a closed subspace in a stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, then the pseudocompletion &lt;math&gt;Z=(X/E)^\triangledown&lt;/math&gt; of the (locally convex) quotient space &lt;math&gt;X/E&lt;/math&gt; is an open immediate quotient space of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. All open immediate quotient spaces have this form. 
# There are stereotype spaces &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with immediate quotient spaces &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; which cannot be represented in the form &lt;math&gt;Z=X/E&lt;/math&gt;.{{sfn|Akbarov|2016|p=138}}  
# In contrast to the category '''LocConv''' of locally convex spaces in the category '''Ste''' immediate quotient spaces are not always open.{{sfn|Akbarov|2016|p=138}}

==Category '''Ste''' of stereotype spaces==
The class '''Ste''' of stereotype spaces forms a category with linear continuous maps as morphisms and possesses the following properties:

:* '''Ste''' is [[Pre-abelian category|pre-abelian]]{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=224}};
:*
:* '''Ste''' is [[Complete category|bicomplete]]{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=226}};

:*
:* '''Ste''' is a [[*-autonomous category]].{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=245}}

===Kernel and cokernel in the category '''Ste'''===
'''Ste''' is a [[pre-abelian category]]: each morphism &lt;math&gt;\varphi:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; in the category '''Ste''' has a [[Kernel (category theory)|kernel]]
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ker}\varphi=\{x\in X:\varphi(x)=0\}^\vartriangle=\operatorname{Env}^X\{x\in X:\varphi(x)=0\}&lt;/math&gt;
and a [[Cokernel (category theory)|cokernel]]  
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Coker}\varphi=\Big(Y\Big/\overline{\varphi(X)}\Big)^\triangledown&lt;/math&gt;
As a corollary, &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; has an image &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Im}\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and a coimage &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Coim}\varphi&lt;/math&gt; as well. The following natural identities hold:{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=224}}
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; (\operatorname{Ker}\varphi)^\star =\operatorname{Coker}(\varphi^\star), &amp; &amp; (\operatorname{Coker}\varphi)^\star =\operatorname{Ker}(\varphi^\star), \\[5pt]

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Q^{\perp}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the pseudosaturation of the annihilator of the subspace &lt;math&gt;Q\subseteq P&lt;/math&gt; in the dual space &lt;math&gt;P^\star&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;Q^\perp=\{f\in P^\star: \ f|_Q=0\}^\vartriangle=\operatorname{Env}^{P^\star}\{f\in P^\star: \ f|_Q=0\}&lt;/math&gt;.

==='''Ste''' as a *-autonomous category===
For any two stereotype spaces &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; the ''stereotype space of operators'' &lt;math&gt;Y\oslash X&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as the pseudosaturation of the space &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{L}(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; of all linear continuous maps &lt;math&gt;\varphi:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; endowed with the topology of uniform convergeance on totally bounded sets. The space &lt;math&gt;Y\oslash X&lt;/math&gt; is stereotype. It defines two natural tensor products

: &lt;math&gt;X\circledast Y:= (X^\star\oslash Y)^\star,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; X\odot Y := Y\oslash X^\star.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem.''' ''In the category  '''Ste''' the following natural identities hold:{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=245}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2017|p=581}}:''

''In particular, '''Ste''' is a symmetric [[monoidal category]] with respect to the bifunctor &lt;math&gt;\odot&lt;/math&gt;, a symmetric [[closed monoidal category]] with respect to the bifunctor &lt;math&gt;\circledast&lt;/math&gt; and the internal hom-functor &lt;math&gt;\oslash&lt;/math&gt;, and a [[*-autonomous category]]:''

===Limits and colimits in the category '''Ste'''===
'''Ste''' is a [[Complete category|bicomplete]] category: each small diagram &lt;math&gt;F:J\to\,&lt;/math&gt;'''Ste''' has a [[direct limit|limit]], &lt;math&gt;\lim_{j\to\infty}F_j&lt;/math&gt;, which coincides with the pseudocompletion of the corresponding limit in the category '''LocConv''' of locally convex spaces 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{j\to\infty}F_j=\Big(\overset{\operatorname{\bf LocConv}}{\lim_{j\to\infty}}F_j\Big)^\triangledown&lt;/math&gt;, 
and a [[inverse limit|colimit]], &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\infty\gets j}F_j&lt;/math&gt;, which coincides with the pseudosaturation of the corresponding colimit in '''LocConv'''
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\infty\gets j}F_j=\Big(\overset{\operatorname{\bf LocConv}}{\lim_{\infty\gets j}}F_j\Big)^\vartriangle&lt;/math&gt;. 
However, the [[Coproduct (category theory)|direct sum]] and the [[Product (category theory)|direct product]] in '''Ste''' coincide with the corresponding constructions in '''LocConv''':
:&lt;math&gt;
\bigoplus_{i\in I} X_i=\overset{\operatorname{\bf LocConv}}{\bigoplus_{i\in I}} X_i,\quad \prod_{i\in I} X_i=\overset{\operatorname{\bf LocConv}}{\prod_{i\in I}X_i}.

The following natural identities hold:{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=245}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2017|p=581}}

===Grothendieck transformation===

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are stereotype spaces then for each elements &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y\in Y&lt;/math&gt; the formula 
:&lt;math&gt;
(x\circledast y)(\varphi)=\varphi(y)(x),\qquad \varphi\in X^\star\oslash Y
&lt;/math&gt;
defines an ''elementary tensor'' &lt;math&gt;x\circledast y\in X\circledast Y=(X^\star\oslash Y)^\star&lt;/math&gt;, and the formula
:&lt;math&gt;
(x\odot y)(f)=f(x)\cdot y,\qquad f\in X^\star
&lt;/math&gt;
defines an ''elementary tensor'' &lt;math&gt;x\odot y\in X\odot Y=Y\oslash X^\star&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem.'''{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=246}} ''For each stereotype spaces  &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; there is a unique linear continuous map &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{X,Y}: X\circledast Y\to X\odot Y&lt;/math&gt; which turns elementary tensors &lt;math&gt;x\circledast y&lt;/math&gt; into elementary tensors'' &lt;math&gt;x\odot y&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma_{X,Y}(x\circledast y)=x\odot y,\qquad x\in X, \ y\in Y.
&lt;/math&gt;
''The family of maps &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{X,Y}: X\circledast Y\to X\odot Y&lt;/math&gt; defines a natural transformation of the bifunctor &lt;math&gt;\circledast&lt;/math&gt; into the bifunctor &lt;math&gt;\odot&lt;/math&gt;''.

*The map &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{X,Y}&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''Grothendieck transformation''.

===Stereotype approximation property===
A stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to have the ''stereotype approximation property'', if each linear continuous map &lt;math&gt;\varphi:X\to X&lt;/math&gt; can be approximated in the stereotype space of operators &lt;math&gt;X\oslash X&lt;/math&gt; by the linear continuous maps of finite rank. This condition is weaker than the existence of the [[Schauder basis]], but formally stronger than the classical [[approximation property]] (however, it is not clear (2017) whether the stereotype approximation property coincides with the classical one, or not). 

'''Theorem.'''{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=264}} ''For a stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; the following conditions are equivalent:''  
:(i) &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; ''has the stereotype approximation property;''
:(ii) ''the Grothendieck transformation &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{X,X^\star}:X\circledast X^\star\to X\odot X^\star&lt;/math&gt; is a monomorphism (in the category '''Ste''');''
:(iii) ''the Grothendieck transformation &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{X,X^\star}:X\circledast X^\star\to X\odot X^\star&lt;/math&gt; is an epimorphism (in the category '''Ste''');''
:(iv) ''for any stereotype space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; the Grothendieck transformation &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{X,Y}:X\circledast Y\to X\odot Y&lt;/math&gt; is a monomorphism (in the category '''Ste''');''
:(v) ''for any stereotype space &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; the Grothendieck transformation &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{X,Y}:X\circledast Y\to X\odot Y&lt;/math&gt; is an epimorphism (in the category '''Ste''').''

'''Theorem.'''{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=265}} ''If two stereotype spaces &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; have the stereotype approximation property, then the spaces &lt;math&gt;X\oslash Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;X\circledast Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X\odot Y&lt;/math&gt; have the stereotype approximation property as well.''

In particular, if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has the stereotype approximation property, then the same is true for &lt;math&gt;X^\star&lt;/math&gt; and for &lt;math&gt;X\oslash X&lt;/math&gt;.

===Universality of &lt;math&gt;\circledast&lt;/math&gt;===

: 1) for each neighborhood of zero &lt;math&gt;W\subseteq Z&lt;/math&gt; and for each compact set &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; there exists a neighborhood of zero &lt;math&gt;V\subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt;  such that &lt;math&gt;\beta(S,V)\subseteq W&lt;/math&gt;, and

: 2) for each neighborhood of zero &lt;math&gt;W\subseteq Z&lt;/math&gt; and for each compact set &lt;math&gt;T\subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt; there exists a neighborhood of zero &lt;math&gt;U\subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\beta(U,T)\subseteq W&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Examples:'''

'''Theorem.'''{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=242}} ''For any stereotype spaces &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; and for any continuous bilinear map &lt;math&gt;\beta:X\times Y\to Z&lt;/math&gt; there exists a unique continuous linear map &lt;math&gt;\widetilde{\beta}:X\circledast Y\to Z&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\widetilde{\beta}\circ\iota=\beta&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\iota(x,y)=x\circledast y, \ x\in X, \ y\in Y&lt;/math&gt;.''

'''Corollary.'''{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=265}} ''For any stereotype space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; the pairing &lt;math&gt;(x,f)\in X\times X^\star\to f(x)\in {\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt; has a unique extension to a linear continuous functional &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{cont}:X\circledast X^\star\to{\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt;. This functional in its turn can be represented as a trace of the operators &lt;math&gt;\varphi:X\to X&lt;/math&gt; occurring as images of the tensors &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in X\circledast X^\star&lt;/math&gt; under the Grothendieck transformation &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{X,X^\star}: X\circledast X^\star\to X\odot X^\star=X\oslash X&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has the stereotype approximation property.''

==Applications==

Being a symmetric monoidal category, '''Ste''' generates the notions of a ''[[stereotype algebra]]'' (as a [[Monoid (category theory)|monoid]] in '''Ste''') and a ''[[Stereotype_algebra#Stereotype_modules|stereotype module]]'' (as a module in '''Ste''' over such a monoid), and for each stereotype algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the categories &lt;sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'''Ste''' and '''Ste'''&lt;sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; of left and right stereotype modules over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are [[Enriched category|enriched categories]] over '''Ste'''.{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=289}} This distinguishes the category '''Ste''' from the other known categories of locally convex spaces, since up to the recent time only the category '''Ban''' of Banach spaces and the category '''Fin''' of finite-dimensional spaces had been known to possess this property. On the other hand, the category '''Ste''' is so wide, and the tools for creating new spaces in '''Ste''' are so diverse, that this suggests the idea that all the results of functional analysis can be reformulated inside the stereotype theory without essential losses. On this way one can even try to completely replace the category of locally convex spaces in analysis (and in related areas) by the category '''Ste''' of stereotype spaces with the view of possible simplifications – this program was announced by S. Akbarov in 2005{{sfn|Akbarov|2005}} and the following results can be considered as evidences of its reasonableness:

:* In the theory of stereotype spaces the approximation property is inherited by the spaces of operators and by tensor products. This allows to reduce the list of counterexamples in comparison with the Banach theory, where as is known the space of operators does not inherit the approximation property.{{sfn|Szankowski|1981}}
:*
:* The arising theory of stereotype algebras allows to simplify constructions in the duality theories for non-commutative groups. In particular, the [[Group algebra#Stereotype group algebras|group algebras]] (and their [[Envelope (category theory)|envelopes]] in the necessary cases) in these theories become [[Hopf algebra]]s in the standard algebraic sense.{{sfn|Akbarov|2003|p=278}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2009|p=507}}{{sfn|Kuznetsova|2013}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2017}} 
:*
:* This in its turn leads to a family of generalizations of the [[Pontryagin duality]] based on the notion of [[Envelope (category theory)|envelope]]: the  holomorphic, the smooth and the continuous envelopes of stereotype algebras give rise respectively to the holomorphic, the smooth and the continuous dualities in ''big geometric disciplines'' – [[complex geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[topology]] – for certain classes of (not necessarily commutative) topological groups considered in these disciplines ([[affine algebraic group]]s, and some classes of [[Lie group]]s and Moore groups).{{sfn|Akbarov|2009}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2016}}{{sfn|Akbarov|2017}}{{sfn|Kuznetsova|2013}}

'''Temple Chevallier''' FRAS&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adsbit.harvard.edu/full/seri/MNRAS/0034//0000138.000.html|title=1874MNRAS..34R.137. Page 138|website=adsbit.harvard.edu|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (19 October 1794 in [[Badingham]], [[Suffolk]] &amp;ndash; 4 November 1873 in [[Harrow Weald]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] clergyman, [[astronomy|astronomer]], and mathematician.  Between 1847 and 1849, he made important observations regarding [[sunspots]].  Chevallier has been called "a remarkable Victorian [[polymath]]" (Kenworthy, 1994).  Not only did he write many papers on astronomy and physics, he also published a translation of the [[Apostolic Fathers]] that went into a second edition, and translated the works of [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Polycarp]] and [[Ignatius of Antioch]].

==Life==
He was educated at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and was ordained a priest in 1820.  He became a Fellow of Pembroke College in 1819.  He was a Fellow and Tutor of Catharine Hall ([[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]]) in 1820 and Hulsean lecturer in Divinity from 1826 to 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=CHVR812T|name=Chevallier, Temple}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was curate and then vicar of [[St Andrew the Great]], Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{CCEd |type=person |id=6632 |name=Chevallier, Temple (1819 - 1835) |accessed=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His lectures were published as ''Of the proofs of the divine power and wisdom derived from the study of astronomy'' in 1835.{{sfn|Hunt|1887}}

That same year, Chevallier was invited to become Professor of Astronomy at the newly founded [[Durham University|University of Durham]].  A chair of Mathematics and Astronomy existed at the University of Durham between 1841–1871; Chevallier was the one to hold this post. He also served as Reader in Hebrew from 1835-1871, Registrar from 1835-1865, and from 1834-1835 also assisted with lectures in Divinity.{{sfn|Hunt|1887}}

He was instrumental in establishing the [[Durham University Observatory]] (in 1839), serving as its Director for thirty years, and from which he made important observations of [[Jupiter's moons]] and regular [[meteorology|meteorological]] observations. From 1835 until his death, he also served as perpetual Parish Priest at [[Esh, County Durham|Esh]], just outside Durham, where he founded the village school and restored the church.{{sfn|Hunt|1887}}

After his resignation in 1871 from his academic posts following a [[stroke]], he died on 4 November 1873.{{sfn|Hunt|1887}}

==Family==
Chevallier had married, in 1825, Catherine Wheelwright,{{sfn|Hunt|1887}} the daughter of an American Loyalist. She died in 1858. He had three children: Catherine Temple, Alicia Temple and Temple (who died as a child).

== Legacy ==
*Chevallier was the first British astronomer to institute regular and continuous observation of [[sunspot]]s.
*He is entablatured in the Cathedral Chapel of the Nine Altars (Durham) and is portrayed in the Great Hall of [[Durham Castle]] ([[University College, Durham]]) as a large, imposing man, with a heavy beard.
*The [[lunar crater]] [[Chevallier (crater)|Chevallier]] is named after him.

[[Image:13-Weak-Orders.svg|thumb|The 13 possible strict weak orderings on a set of three elements {''a'', ''b'', ''c''}. The only [[partial order|partially ordered]] sets are coloured, while [[total order|totally ordered]] ones are in black. Two orderings are shown as connected by an edge if they differ by a single dichotomy.]]

In [[mathematics]], especially [[order theory]], a '''weak ordering''' is a mathematical formalization of the intuitive notion of a [[ranking]] of a [[set (mathematics)|set]], some of whose members may be [[Tie (draw)|tied]] with each other. Weak orders are a generalization of [[totally ordered set]]s (rankings without ties) and are in turn generalized by [[partially ordered set]]s and [[preorder]]s.&lt;ref name="fr11"&gt;{{citation|title=Applied Combinatorics|first1=Fred|last1=Roberts|first2=Barry|last2=Tesman|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=2011|isbn=9781420099836|at=Section 4.2.4 Weak Orders, pp. 254–256}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several common ways of formalizing weak orderings, that are different from each other but [[cryptomorphism|cryptomorphic]] (interconvertable with no loss of information): they may be axiomatized as '''strict weak orderings''' (partially ordered sets in which incomparability is a [[transitive relation]]), as '''total preorders''' (transitive binary relations in which at least one of the two possible relations exists between every pair of elements), or as '''ordered partitions''' ([[partition of a set|partitions]] of the elements into disjoint subsets, together with a total order on the subsets). In many cases another representation called a '''preferential arrangement''' based on a [[utility function]] is also possible.

Weak orderings are counted by the [[ordered Bell number]]s. They are used in [[computer science]] as part of [[partition refinement]] algorithms, and in the [[C++ Standard Library]].&lt;ref name="cpp"&gt;{{citation|title=The C++ Standard Library: A Tutorial and Reference|first=Nicolai M.|last=Josuttis|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=2012|isbn=9780132977739|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9DEJKhasp7gC&amp;pg=PT469|page=469}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
In [[horse racing]], the use of [[photo finish]]es has eliminated some, but not all, ties or (as they are called in this context) [[List of dead heat horse races|dead heat]]s, so the outcome of a horse race may be modeled by a weak ordering.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Those Fascinating Numbers|first=J. M.|last=de Koninck|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2009|isbn=9780821886311|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qYuC1WsDKq8C&amp;pg=PA4|page=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In an example from the [[Maryland Hunt Cup]] steeplechase in 2007, The Bruce was the clear winner, but two horses Bug River and Lear Charm tied for second place, with the remaining horses farther back; three horses did not finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Bruce hangs on for Hunt Cup victory: Bug River, Lear Charm finish in dead heat for second|newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=April 29, 2007|first=Kent|last=Baker|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-162753665.html|subscription=yes}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the weak ordering describing this outcome, The Bruce would be first, Bug River and Lear Charm would be ranked after The Bruce but before all the other horses that finished, and the three horses that did not finish would be placed last in the order but tied with each other.

The points of the [[Euclidean plane]] may be ordered by their [[Euclidean distance|distance]] from the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]], giving another example of a weak ordering with infinitely many elements, infinitely many subsets of tied elements (the sets of points that belong to a common [[circle]] centered at the origin), and infinitely many points within these subsets. Although this ordering has a smallest element (the origin itself), it does not have any second-smallest elements, nor any largest element.

[[Opinion poll]]ing in political elections provides an example of a type of ordering that resembles weak orderings, but is better modeled mathematically in other ways. In the results of a poll, one candidate may be clearly ahead of another, or the two candidates may be statistically tied, meaning not that their poll results are equal but rather that they are within the [[margin of error]] of each other. However, if candidate ''x'' is statistically tied with ''y'', and ''y'' is statistically tied with ''z'', it might still be possible for ''x'' to be clearly better than ''z'', so being tied is not in this case a [[transitive relation]]. Because of this possibility, rankings of this type are better modeled as [[semiorder]]s than as weak orderings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Behavioral Social Choice: Probabilistic Models, Statistical Inference, and Applications|pages=113ff|first=Michel|last=Regenwetter|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780521536660}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Axiomatizations==

===Strict weak orderings===
A '''strict weak ordering''' is a [[binary relation]]&amp;nbsp;&lt; on a set ''S'' that is a [[strict partial order]] (a [[transitive relation]] that is [[Reflexive relation|irreflexive]], or equivalently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flaška|first1=V.|last2=Ježek|first2=J.|last3=Kepka|first3=T.|last4=Kortelainen|first4=J.|title=Transitive Closures of Binary Relations I|year=2007|publisher=School of Mathematics - Physics Charles University|location=Prague|page=1|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3c4d/5e71464107b1cc612ba2c3a6a1c7aeb78007.pdf}} Lemma 1.1 (iv). Note that this source refers to asymmetric relations as "strictly antisymmetric".&lt;/ref&gt; that is [[asymmetric relation|asymmetric]]) in which the relation "neither ''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b'' nor ''b''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''a''" is transitive.&lt;ref name="fr11"/&gt; Therefore, a strict weak ordering has the following properties:
* For all ''x'' in ''S'', it is not the case that ''x'' &lt; ''x'' ([[Irreflexive relation|irreflexivity]]).
* For all ''x'', ''y'' in ''S'', if ''x'' &lt; ''y'' then it is not the case that ''y'' &lt; ''x'' ([[Asymmetric relation|asymmetry]]).
* For all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''S'', if ''x'' &lt; ''y'' and ''y'' &lt; ''z'' then ''x'' &lt; ''z'' ([[Transitive relation|transitivity]]).
* For all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''S'', if ''x'' is incomparable with ''y'' (neither ''x'' &lt; ''y'' nor ''y'' &lt; ''x'' hold), and ''y'' is incomparable with ''z'', then ''x'' is incomparable with ''z'' (transitivity of incomparability).
This list of properties is somewhat redundant, in that asymmetry implies irreflexivity, and in that irreflexivity and transitivity together imply asymmetry.

The "incomparability relation" is an [[equivalence relation]], and its [[equivalence class]]es partition the elements of ''S'', and are [[Total order|totally ordered]] by&amp;nbsp;&lt;. Conversely, any total order on a [[Partition (set theory)|partition]] of ''S'' gives rise to a strict weak ordering in which ''x'' &lt; ''y'' if and only if there exists sets ''A'' and ''B'' in the partition with ''x'' in ''A'', ''y'' in ''B'', and ''A''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''B'' in the total order.

Not every partial order obeys the transitive law for incomparability. For instance, consider the partial order in the set {''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'',&amp;nbsp;''c''} defined by the relationship ''b''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''c''. The pairs ''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'' and ''a'',&amp;nbsp;''c'' are incomparable but ''b'' and ''c'' are related, so incomparability does not form an equivalence relation and this example is not a strict weak ordering.

Transitivity of incomparability (together with transitivity) can also be stated in the following forms:
* If ''x'' &lt; ''y'', then for all ''z'', either ''x'' &lt; ''z'' or ''z'' &lt; ''y'' or both.
Or:
* If ''x'' is incomparable with ''y'', then for all ''z''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''x'', ''z''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''y'', either (''x'' &lt; ''z'' and ''y'' &lt; ''z'') or (''z'' &lt; ''x'' and ''z'' &lt; ''y'') or (''z'' is incomparable with ''x'' and ''z'' is incomparable with ''y'').

===Total preorders&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Preference (economics)]]--&gt;===
Strict weak orders are very closely related to '''total preorders''' or '''(non-strict) weak orders''', and the same mathematical concepts that can be modeled with strict weak orderings can be modeled equally well with total preorders. A total preorder or weak order is a [[preorder]] that also is a [[connex relation]];&lt;ref&gt;In older sources, the connex property is called ''totality'' property. However, this terminology is disadvantageous as it may lead to confusion with e.g. the unrelated notion of [[right-total]]ity, a.k.a. surjectivity.&lt;/ref&gt; that is, no pair of items is incomparable. A total preorder &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the following properties:

* For all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', if ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''y'' and ''y'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''z'' then ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''z'' (transitivity).
* For all ''x'' and ''y'', ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''y'' or ''y'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' (connex property).
** Hence, for all ''x'', ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' (reflexivity).

A [[total order]] is a total preorder which is antisymmetric, in other words, which is also a [[Partially ordered set|partial order]]. Total preorders are sometimes also called '''preference relations'''.

The [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of a strict weak order is a total preorder, and vice versa, but it seems more natural to relate strict weak orders and total preorders in a way that preserves rather than reverses the order of the elements.  Thus we take the [[inverse relation|inverse]] of the complement: for a strict weak ordering &lt;, define a total preorder &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; by setting ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''y'' whenever it is not the case that ''y'' &lt; ''x''. In the other direction, to define a strict weak ordering &lt; from a total preorder &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt;, set ''x'' &lt; ''y'' whenever it is not the case that ''y'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''x''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Multicriteria Optimization|first=Matthias|last=Ehrgott|publisher=Springer|year=2005|isbn=9783540276593|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AwRjo6iP4_UC&amp;pg=PA10|at=Proposition 1.9, p.&amp;nbsp;10}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In any preorder there is a [[Preorder#Constructions|corresponding equivalence relation]] where two elements ''x'' and ''y'' are defined as '''equivalent''' if ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''y'' and ''y'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''x''. In the case of a ''total'' preorder the corresponding partial order on the set of equivalence classes is a total order. Two elements are equivalent in a total preorder if and only if they are incomparable in the corresponding strict weak ordering.

===Ordered partitions===
A [[partition of a set]] ''S'' is a family of disjoint subsets of ''S'' that have ''S'' as their union. A partition, together with a [[total order]] on the sets of the partition, gives a structure called by [[Richard P. Stanley]] an '''ordered partition'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Richard P.|last=Stanley|authorlink=Richard P. Stanley|title=Enumerative Combinatorics, Vol. 2|series=Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics|volume=62|page=297|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Theodore Motzkin]] a '''list of sets'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

:{''a''}, {''b''},
:{''b''}, {''a''}, and
:{''a'', ''b''}.

In a strict weak ordering, the equivalence classes of incomparability give a set partition, in which the sets inherit a total ordering from their elements, giving rise to an ordered partition. In the other direction, any ordered partition gives rise to a strict weak ordering in which two elements are incomparable when they belong to the same set in the partition, and otherwise inherit the order of the sets that contain them.

===Representation by functions===
For sets of sufficiently small [[cardinality]], a third axiomatization is possible, based on real-valued functions. If ''X'' is any set and ''f'' a real-valued function on ''X'' then ''f'' induces a strict weak order on ''X'' by setting ''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b'' if and only if ''f''(''a'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''f''(''b''). The associated total preorder is given by setting ''a''&lt;math&gt;{}\lesssim{}&lt;/math&gt;''b'' if and only if ''f''(''a'')&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''f''(''b''),
and the associated equivalence by setting ''a''&lt;math&gt;{}\sim{}&lt;/math&gt;''b'' if and only if ''f''(''a'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''(''b'').

The relations do not change when ''f'' is replaced by ''g''&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;''f'' ([[Function composition|composite function]]), where ''g'' is a [[Monotonic function|strictly increasing]] real-valued function defined on at least the range of&amp;nbsp;''f''. Thus e.g. a [[Utility#Utility functions|utility function]] defines a [[preference]] relation. In this context, weak orderings are also known as '''preferential arrangements'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

If ''X'' is finite or countable, every weak order on ''X'' can be represented by a function in this way.&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;{{citation

For example, there is no such function for the [[lexicographic order]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, while in most preference relation models the relation defines a utility function [[up to]] order-preserving transformations, there is no such function for [[lexicographic preferences]].

More generally, if ''X'' is a set, and ''Y'' is a set with a strict weak ordering "&lt;", and ''f'' a function from ''X'' to ''Y'', then ''f'' induces a strict weak ordering on ''X'' by setting ''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b'' if and only if ''f''(''a'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''f''(''b''). As before, the associated total preorder is given by setting ''a''&lt;math&gt;{}\lesssim{}&lt;/math&gt;''b'' if and only if ''f''(''a'')&lt;math&gt;{}\lesssim{}&lt;/math&gt;''f''(''b''), and the associated equivalence by setting ''a''&lt;math&gt;{}\sim{}&lt;/math&gt;''b'' if and only if ''f''(''a'')&lt;math&gt;{}\sim{}&lt;/math&gt;''f''(''b''). It is not assumed here that ''f'' is an [[injective function]], so a class of two equivalent elements on ''Y'' may induce a larger class of equivalent elements on ''X''. Also, ''f'' is not assumed to be an [[surjective function]], so a class of equivalent elements on ''Y'' may induce a smaller or empty class on ''X''. However, the function ''f'' induces an injective function that maps the partition on ''X'' to that on ''Y''. Thus, in the case of finite partitions, the number of classes in ''X'' is less than or equal to the number of classes on ''Y''.

For a strict weak order "&lt;" another associated reflexive relation is its [[Binary relation#Operations on binary relations|reflexive closure]], a (non-strict) partial order "≤". The two associated reflexive relations differ with regard to different ''a'' and ''b'' for which neither ''a'' &lt; ''b'' nor ''b'' &lt; ''a'': in the total preorder corresponding to a strict weak order we get ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''b'' and ''b'' &lt;math&gt;\lesssim&lt;/math&gt; ''a'', while in the partial order given by the reflexive closure we get neither ''a'' ≤ ''b'' nor ''b'' ≤ ''a''. For strict total orders these two associated reflexive relations are the same: the corresponding (non-strict) total order.&lt;ref name="h2pi"/&gt; The reflexive closure of a strict weak ordering is a type of [[series-parallel partial order]].

==All weak orders on a finite set==

===Combinatorial enumeration===
{{main|ordered Bell number}}
The number of distinct weak orders (represented either as strict weak orders or as total preorders) on an ''n''-element set is given by the following sequence {{OEIS|id=A000670}}:
{{number of relations}}

These numbers are also called the '''Fubini numbers''' or '''ordered Bell numbers'''.

For example, for a set of three labeled items, there is one weak order in which all three items are tied. There are three ways of partitioning the items into one [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] set and one group of two tied items, and each of these partitions gives two weak orders (one in which the singleton is smaller than the group of two, and one in which this ordering is reversed), giving six weak orders of this type. And there is a single way of partitioning the set into three singletons, which can be totally ordered in six different ways. Thus, altogether, there are 13 different weak orders on three items.

===Adjacency structure===
[[File:Permutohedron.svg|thumb|300px|The permutohedron on four elements, a three-dimensional [[convex polyhedron]]. It has 24 vertices, 36 edges, and 14 two-dimensional faces, which all together with the whole three-dimensional polyhedron correspond to the 75 weak orderings on four elements.]]
Unlike for partial orders, the family of weak orderings on a given finite set is not in general connected by moves that add or remove a single order relation to a given ordering. For instance, for three elements, the ordering in which all three elements are tied differs by at least two pairs from any other weak ordering on the same set, in either the strict weak ordering or total preorder axiomatizations. However, a different kind of move is possible, in which the weak orderings on a set are more highly connected. Define a ''dichotomy'' to be a weak ordering with two equivalence classes, and define a dichotomy to be ''compatible'' with a given weak ordering if every two elements that are related in the ordering are either related in the same way or tied in the dichotomy. Alternatively, a dichotomy may be defined as a [[Dedekind cut]] for a weak ordering. Then a weak ordering may be characterized by its set of compatible dichotomies. For a finite set of labeled items, every pair of weak orderings may be connected to each other by a sequence of moves that add or remove one dichotomy at a time to or from this set of dichotomies. Moreover, the [[undirected graph]] that has the weak orderings as its vertices, and these moves as its edges, forms a [[partial cube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Media Theory: Interdisciplinary Applied Mathematics|first1=David|last1=Eppstein|author1-link=David Eppstein|first2=Jean-Claude|last2=Falmagne|author2-link=Jean-Claude Falmagne|first3=Sergei|last3=Ovchinnikov|publisher=Springer|year=2008|at=Section 9.4, Weak Orders and Cubical Complexes, pp. 188–196}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geometrically, the total orderings of a given finite set may be represented as the vertices of a [[permutohedron]], and the dichotomies on this same set as the facets of the permutohedron. In this geometric representation, the weak orderings on the set correspond to the faces of all different dimensions of the permutohedron (including the permutohedron itself, but not the empty set, as a face). The [[codimension]] of a face gives the number of equivalence classes in the corresponding weak ordering.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Günter M.|last=Ziegler|authorlink=Günter M. Ziegler|title=Lectures on Polytopes|publisher=Springer|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=152|year=1995|page=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this geometric representation the partial cube of moves on weak orderings is the graph describing the [[covering relation]] of the [[face lattice]] of the permutohedron.

For instance, for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, the permutohedron on three elements is just a regular hexagon. The face lattice of the hexagon (again, including the hexagon itself as a face, but not including the empty set) has thirteen elements: one hexagon, six edges, and six vertices, corresponding to the one completely tied weak ordering, six weak orderings with one tie, and six total orderings. The graph of moves on these 13 weak orderings is shown in the figure.

==Applications==
As mentioned above, weak orders have applications in utility theory.&lt;ref name="roberts"/&gt; In [[linear programming]] and other types of [[combinatorial optimization]] problem, the prioritization of solutions or of bases is often given by a weak order, determined by a real-valued [[objective function]]; the phenomenon of ties in these orderings is called "degeneracy", and several types of tie-breaking rule have been used to refine this weak ordering into a total ordering in order to prevent problems caused by degeneracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Linear Programming|first=Vašek|last=Chvátal|authorlink=Vašek Chvátal|publisher=Macmillan|year=1983|isbn=9780716715870|pages=29–38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DN20_tW_BV0C&amp;pg=PA29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weak orders have also been used in [[computer science]], in [[partition refinement]] based algorithms for [[lexicographic breadth-first search]] and [[Coffman–Graham algorithm|lexicographic topological ordering]]. In these algorithms, a weak ordering on the vertices of a graph (represented as a family of sets that [[partition of a set|partition]] the vertices, together with a [[doubly linked list]] providing a total order on the sets) is gradually refined over the course of the algorithm, eventually producing a total ordering that is the output of the algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
