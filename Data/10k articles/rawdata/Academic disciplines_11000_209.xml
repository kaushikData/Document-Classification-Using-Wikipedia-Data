'''''A History of English Medieval Architecture''''' is a book published in three volumes in 1912, re-published in two volumes in 1921 and one volume in 1931, by architect and artist [[Cyril Edward Power]]. It features 424 of his drawings and illustrations and was published by Talbot Press.

On July 5, 1912, ''Building News'' stated: "While the ordinary reader will scan the book with pleasurable interest, the architectural student of Mediaeval architecture who believes - some still believe it, we suppose even in these days - that structural integrity was the raison d'être of Gothic art, will follow Mr Power's intelligent exposition with profit, and find stimulation to further study."

Power states that the purpose of the book is to "make the various stages of early life in these islands intelligible."

These books were the outcome of a series of lectures Power gave in 1907 at [[Goldsmiths College]] New Cross. The books were renowned for their intricate detail and exhaustive research. Shortly after their publication, Powers began lecturing in architecture at [[The Grosvenor School of Modern Art]].

'''Acid rain''' is a [[rain]] or any other form of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] that is unusually [[acid]]ic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low [[pH]]). It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals and infrastructure. Acid rain is caused by emissions of [[sulfur dioxide|sulphur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen oxide]], which react with the [[Properties of water|water molecules]] in the [[atmosphere]] to produce acids. Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by [[lightning]] strikes, and sulphur dioxide is produced by [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]]. Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms, causing paint to peel, [[corrosion]] of steel structures such as bridges, and [[weathering]] of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health.

==Definition==
"Acid rain" is a popular term referring to the deposition of a mixture from wet (rain, snow, sleet, fog,  cloudwater, and dew) and dry (acidifying particles and gases) acidic components. [[Distilled water]], once [[carbon dioxide]] is removed, has a neutral pH of 7. Liquids with a pH less than 7 are acidic, and those with a [[pH]] greater than 7 are alkaline. "Clean" or unpolluted rain has an acidic pH, but usually no lower than 5.7, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form [[carbonic acid]], a weak acid according to the following reaction:

:{{Chemical formula|H|2|O}} (l) + {{Chemical formula |C||O|2}} (g) {{eqm}} {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}} ([[Aqueous solution|aq]])

Carbonic acid then can ionize in water forming low concentrations of [[carbonate]] and [[hydronium]] ions:

:{{Chemical formula|H|2|O}} (l) + {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}} (aq) {{eqm}} {{Chemical formula|H||C||O|3}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) + {{Chemical formula|H|3|O}}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq)

However, unpolluted rain can also contain other chemicals which affect its pH (acidity level). A common example is [[nitric acid]] produced by [[electric discharge]] in the atmosphere such as [[lightning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/JD092iD11p13299|author1=Likens, Gene E. |author2=Keene, William C. |author3=Miller, John M. |author4=Galloway, James N. |title=Chemistry of precipitation from a remote, terrestrial site in Australia|year=1987|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=92|issue=D11 |page=13299 |bibcode=1987JGR....9213299L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acid deposition as an [[environmental issue]] (discussed later in the article) would include additional acids other than {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}}.

==History==

The corrosive effect of polluted, acidic city air on limestone and marble was noted in the 17th century by [[John Evelyn]], who remarked upon the poor condition of the [[Arundel marbles]].&lt;ref&gt;E. S. de Beer, ed. ''[[The Diary of John Evelyn]]'', III, 1955 (19 September 1667) p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere have increased.&lt;ref name="NASA Glossary"&gt;{{Citation

Public awareness of acid rain in the U.S increased in the 1970s after [[The New York Times]] published reports from the [[Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest]] in [[New Hampshire]] of the myriad deleterious environmental effects shown to result from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Likens, G.

The problem of acid rain has not only increased with population and industrial growth, but has become more widespread. The use of tall smokestacks to reduce local [[pollution]] has contributed to the spread of acid rain by releasing gases into regional atmospheric circulation.&lt;ref name="Likens, G. E. 1979"&gt;{{cite journal|author =Likens, G. E. |author2=Wright, R. F. |author3=Galloway, J. N. |author4=Butler, T.

E. |year=1984|title= Acid rain: the smokestack is the "smoking gun" |journal=Garden |volume=8|issue=4|pages=12–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often deposition occurs a considerable distance downwind of the emissions, with mountainous regions tending to receive the greatest deposition (simply because of their higher rainfall). An example of this effect is the low pH of rain which falls in [[Scandinavia]].

The earliest report about acid rain in the United States was from the chemical evidence from [[Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest|Hubbard Brook]] Valley. In 1972, a group of scientists including [[Gene Likens]] discovered the rain that was deposited at White Mountains of New Hampshire was acidic. The pH of the sample was measured to be 4.03 at Hubbard Brook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Likens|first=Gene E.|last2=Bormann|first2=F.

Acid rain that mixed with stream water at Hubbard Brook was neutralized by the alumina from soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Noye M.|last2=Driscoll|first2=Charles T.|last3=Eaton|first3=John S.|last4=Likens|first4=Gene E.|last5=McDowell|first5=William H.|date=1981-09-01|title='Acid rain', dissolved aluminum and chemical weathering at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0016703781902763|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=45|issue=9|pages=1421–1437|doi=10.1016/0016-7037(81)90276-3|bibcode=1981GeCoA..45.1421J}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of this research indicates the chemical reaction between acid rain and aluminum leads to increasing rate of soil weathering. Experimental research was done to examine the effects of increased acidity in stream on ecological species. In 1980, a group of scientists modified the acidity of Norris Brook, New Hampshire, and observed the change in species’ behaviors. There was a decrease in species diversity, an increase in community dominants, and a decrease in the [[food web]] complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Ronald J.|last2=Likens|first2=Gene E.|last3=Fiance|first3=Sandy B.|last4=Hendrey|first4=George R.|date=1980-08-01|title=Experimental Acidification of a Stream in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=61|issue=4|pages=976–989|doi=10.2307/1936765|issn=1939-9170|jstor=1936765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the U.S. Congress passed an [[Acid Deposition Act]].&lt;ref name="Lackey"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/staff/lackey/pubs/ACID-RAIN-SCIENCE-POLICY-LACKEY-BLAIR-JOURNAL-REPRINT-1997.pdf |author =Lackey, R.T. |year=1997|title= Science, policy, and acid rain: lessons learned|journal= Renewable Resources Journal|volume= 15|issue=1|pages= 9–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act established an 18-year assessment and research program under the direction of the National Acidic Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP). NAPAP looked at the entire problem from a scientific perspective. It enlarged a network of monitoring sites to determine how acidic the precipitation actually was, and to determine long-term trends, and established a network for dry deposition. It looked at the effects of acid rain and funded research on the effects of acid precipitation on freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, historical buildings, monuments, and building materials. It also funded extensive studies on atmospheric processes and potential control programs.

From the start, policy advocates from all sides attempted to influence NAPAP activities to support their particular policy advocacy efforts, or to disparage those of their opponents.&lt;ref name="Lackey" /&gt;  For the U.S. Government's scientific enterprise, a significant impact of NAPAP were lessons learned in the assessment process and in environmental research management to a relatively large group of scientists, program managers and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1462-9011(98)00006-9|title=Acid rain: Science and policy making|year=1998|last1=Winstanley|first1=Derek|last2=Lackey|first2=Robert T.|last3=Warnick|first3=Walter L.|last4=Malanchuk|first4=John|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Policy|volume=1|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, the National Academy of Sciences was looking into research about the controversial issues regarding acid rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/08/science/acid-rain-issue-creates-stress-between-administration-and-science-academy.html|title=ACID RAIN ISSUE CREATES STRESS BETWEEN ADMINISTRATION AND SCIENCE ACADEMY|last=Times|first=Robert Reinhold, Special To The New York|date=1982-06-08|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Ronald Reagan did not place a huge attention on the issues of acid rain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Ronald_Reagan_Environment.htm|title=Ronald Reagan on Environment|website=www.ontheissues.org|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; until his personal visit to Canada and confirmed that Canadian border suffered from the drifting pollution from smokestacks in Midwest of US.

In 1983, the panel of scientists came up with a draft report, which concluded that acid rain is a real problem and solutions should be sought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/20013U0E.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1981+Thru+1985&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D:%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C81thru85%5CTxt%5C00000012%5C20013U0E.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=hpfr&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1&amp;SeekPage=x&amp;ZyPURL|title=Report of the Acid Rain Peer Review Panel|last=|first=|date=July 1984|website=Document Display {{!}} NEPIS {{!}} US EPA|publisher=|language=en|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; White House [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] reviewed the draft report and sent [[Fred Singer]]’s suggestions of the report, which cast doubt on the cause of acid rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://grist.org/article/from-tobacco-to-climate-change-merchants-of-doubt-undermined-the-science/full/|title=From tobacco to climate change, ‘merchants of doubt’ undermined the science|date=2010-04-17|newspaper=Grist|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panelists revealed rejections against Singer’s positions and submitted the report to Nierenberg in April. In May 1983, the House of Representatives voted against legislations that aimed to control sulphur emissions. There was a debate about whether Nierenberg delayed to release the report. Nierenberg himself denied the saying about his suppression of the report and explained that the withheld of the report after the House's vote was due to the fact that the report was not ready to be published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/18/us/legislators-sat-white-house-suppressed-acid-rain-report.html|title=LEGISLATORS SAT WHITE HOUSE SUPPRESSED ACID RAIN REPORT|last=Franklin|first=Ben A.|date=1984-08-18|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the US National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP) provided its first assessment of acid rain in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program : 1990 integrated assessment report. Washington, D.C. : National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, Office of the Director, [1991]&lt;/ref&gt; It reported that 5% of New England Lakes were acidic, with sulfates being the most common problem. They noted that 2% of the lakes could no longer support Brook Trout, and 6% of the lakes were unsuitable for the survival of many species of minnow. Subsequent Reports to Congress have documented chemical changes in soil and freshwater ecosystems, nitrogen saturation, decreases in amounts of nutrients in soil, episodic acidification, regional haze, and damage to historical monuments.

Meanwhile, in 1990, the U.S. Congress passed a series of amendments to the Clean Air Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/clean-air-act-title-iv-subchapter-acid-deposition-control |title=Clean Air Act Title IV - Subchapter A: Acid Deposition Control &amp;#124; Overview of the Clean Air Act and Air Pollution &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Title IV of these amendments established the a [[cap and trade]] system designed to control emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;John Bachmann, David Calkins, Margo Oge. [http://www.epaalumni.org/hcp/air.pdf “Cleaning the Air We Breathe: A Half Century of Progress.”] EPA Alumni Association. September 2017. Pages 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;. Title IV called for a total reduction of about 10 million tons of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from power plants, close to a 50% reduction&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. It was implemented in two phases. Phase I began in 1995, and limited sulphur dioxide emissions from 110 of the largest power plants to a combined total of 8.7 million tons of sulphur dioxide. One power plant in New England (Merrimack) was in Phase I. Four other plants (Newington, Mount Tom, Brayton Point, and Salem Harbor) were added under other provisions of the program. Phase II began in 2000, and affects most of the power plants in the country.

During the 1990s, research continued. On March 10, 2005, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). This rule provides states with a solution to the problem of power plant pollution that drifts from one state to another. CAIR will permanently cap emissions of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; in the eastern United States. When fully implemented, CAIR will reduce SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia by over 70% and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by over 60% from 2003 levels.&lt;ref name="US Environmental Protection Agency"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/NE/eco/acidrain/history.html |title=US EPA: A Brief History of Acid Rain |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925214841/http://www.epa.gov/NE/eco/acidrain/history.html |archivedate=2010-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the program's cap and trade program has been successful in achieving its goals. Since the 1990s, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions have dropped 40%, and according to the [[Pacific Research Institute]], acid rain levels have dropped 65% since 1976.&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/03/MNMMTJUS1.DTL&amp;hw=Cap+trade+Acid+Rain&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 'Cap-and-trade' model eyed for cutting greenhouse gases], [[San Francisco Chronicle]], December 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2facts.com/RecordUrl.asp?article=/icof/search/i0702840.asp |title=Facts On File News Services Databases |publisher=2facts.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional regulation was used in the European Union, which saw a decrease of over 70% in SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions during the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;Gilberston, T. and Reyes, O. 2009. [http://www.carbontradewatch.org/carbon-trade-fails Carbon Trading: how it works and why it fails]. Dag Hammarskjöld Foundation: 22&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, total SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions were 8.9 million tons, achieving the program's long-term goal ahead of the 2010 statutory deadline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progress/arp07.html Acid Rain Program 2007 Progress Report], [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the EPA estimated that by 2010, the overall costs of complying with the program for businesses and consumers would be $1 billion to $2 billion a year, only one fourth of what was originally predicted.&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"/&gt; Forbes says: ''In 2010, by which time the cap and trade system had been augmented by the George W. Bush administration’s Clean Air Interstate Rule, SO2 emissions had fallen to 5.1 million tons.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerdes|first1=Justin|title=Cap and Trade Curbed Acid Rain: 7 Reasons Why It Can Do The Same For Climate Change|url=http://onforb.es/yfatTf|website=Forbes|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=27 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Citizen science]] can be traced back as far as January 1989 and a campaign by the [[National Audubon Society|Audubon Society]] to measure Acid rain. Scientist Muki Haklay cites in a policy report for the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|Wilson Center]] entitled 'Citizen Science and Policy: A European Perspective' a first use of the term 'citizen science' by R. Kerson in the magazine [[MIT Technology Review]] from January 1989.&lt;ref name=1stUse&gt;{{cite web|author=Muki Haklay|title=Citizen Science and Policy: A European Perspective|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/Citizen_Science_Policy_European_Perspective_Haklay.pdf|publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|page=11|date=2015|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerson&gt;{{cite magazine|author=R. Kerson|title=Lab for the Environment|journal=MIT Technology Review|date=1989|volume=92|issue=1|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting from the Wilson Center report: "The new form of engagement in science received the name "citizen science". The first recorded example of the use of the term is from 1989, describing how 225 volunteers across the US collected rain samples to assist the Audubon Society in an acid-rain awareness raising campaign. The volunteers collected samples, checked for acidity, and reported back to the organization. The information was then used to demonstrate the full extent of the phenomenon."&lt;ref name=1stUse/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerson/&gt;

==Emissions of chemicals leading to acidification==
The most important gas which leads to acidification is sulphur dioxide. Emissions of nitrogen oxides which are oxidized to form [[nitric acid]] are of increasing importance due to stricter controls on emissions of sulphur containing compounds. 70 Tg(S) per year in the form of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; comes from [[fossil fuel]] combustion and industry, 2.8 Tg(S) from [[wildfires]] and 7–8 Tg(S) per year from [[volcanoes]].&lt;ref name="Berresheim 1995"&gt;Berresheim, H.; Wine, P.H. and Davies D.D. (1995). "Sulfur in the Atmosphere". In ''Composition, Chemistry and Climate of the Atmosphere'', ed. H.B. Singh. Van Nostrand Rheingold {{ISBN|0-442-01264-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural phenomena===
The principal natural [[phenomena]] that contribute acid-producing gases to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] are emissions from volcanoes. Thus, for example, [[fumarole]]s from the Laguna Caliente crater of [[Poás Volcano]] create extremely high amounts of acid rain and fog, with acidity as high as a pH of 2, clearing an area of any vegetation and frequently causing irritation to the eyes and lungs of inhabitants in nearby settlements.
Acid-producing gasses are also created by [[biology|biological]] processes that occur on the land, in [[wetland]]s, and in the [[ocean]]s. The major biological source of sulphur containing compounds is [[dimethyl sulfide]].

Nitric acid in [[rainwater]] is an important source of fixed [[nitrogen]] for plant life, and is also produced by electrical activity in the atmosphere such as [[lightning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www6.dict.cc/wp_examples.php?lp_id=1&amp;lang=en&amp;s=nitric%20acid|title=|last=|first=|date=January 24, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acidic deposits have been detected in [[glacier|glacial ice]] thousands of years old in remote parts of the globe.&lt;ref name="Likens, G. E. 1979"/&gt;

Soils of [[coniferous forests]] are naturally very acidic due to the shedding of needles, and the results of this phenomenon should not be confused with acid rain.

===Human activity===
[[File:Gavin Power Plant.jpg|thumb|The coal-fired [[Gavin Power Plant]] in [[Cheshire, Ohio]]]]
The principal cause of acid rain is sulphur and nitrogen compounds from human sources, such as [[electricity generation]], factories, and [[motor vehicle]]s. Electrical power generation using coal is among the greatest contributors to gaseous pollutions that are responsible for acidic rain. The gases can be carried hundreds of kilometers in the atmosphere before they are converted to acids and deposited. In the past, factories had short funnels to let out smoke but this caused many problems locally; thus, factories now have taller smoke funnels. However, dispersal from these taller stacks causes pollutants to be carried farther, causing widespread ecological damage.

==Chemical processes==
Combustion of fuels produces sulphur dioxide and nitric oxides. They are converted into sulphuric acid and nitric acid.&lt;ref name="CAA01"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/09/980928072644.htm Clean Air Act Reduces Acid Rain In Eastern United States], ''ScienceDaily'', September 28, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gas phase chemistry===
In the [[gas phase]] sulphur dioxide is oxidized by reaction with the [[hydroxyl]] radical via an [[intermolecular]] reaction:&lt;ref name="Seinfeld 1998"/&gt;
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + OH· → HOSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·
which is followed by:
:HOSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;· + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;· + SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
In the presence of water, [[sulfur trioxide|sulphur trioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is converted rapidly to [[sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]]:
:SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq)

[[Nitrogen dioxide]] reacts with OH to form nitric acid:
[[File:Air Pollution-Causes&amp;Effects.svg|thumb|This shows the process of the air pollution being released into the atmosphere and the areas that will be affected.]]
:NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + OH· → HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

===Chemistry in cloud droplets===
When clouds are present, the loss rate of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is faster than can be explained by gas phase chemistry alone. This is due to reactions in the liquid water droplets.

;Hydrolysis

sulphur dioxide dissolves in water and then, like carbon dioxide, [[hydrolysis|hydrolyses]] in a series of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] reactions:

:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
:HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;

;Oxidation

There are a large number of aqueous reactions that [[redox|oxidize]] sulphur from S([[oxidation state|IV]]) to S(VI), leading to the formation of sulphuric acid. The most important oxidation reactions are with [[ozone]], [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[oxygen]] (reactions with oxygen are catalyzed by [[iron]] and [[manganese]] in the cloud droplets).&lt;ref name="Seinfeld 1998"/&gt;

==Acid deposition==

===Wet deposition===
Wet deposition of acids occurs when any form of precipitation (rain, snow, and so on.) removes acids from the atmosphere and delivers it to the Earth's surface. This can result from the deposition of acids produced in the raindrops (see aqueous phase chemistry above) or by the precipitation removing the acids either in clouds or below clouds. Wet removal of both gases and aerosols are both of importance for wet deposition.

===Dry deposition===
Acid deposition also occurs via dry deposition in the absence of precipitation. This can be responsible for as much as 20 to 60% of total acid deposition.&lt;ref name="archive glossary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/glossary.php |title=UK National Air Quality Archive: Air Pollution Glossary |publisher=Airquality.co.uk |date=2002-04-01 |accessdate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417054802/http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/glossary.php |archivedate=2009-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs when particles and gases stick to the ground, plants or other surfaces.

==Adverse effects==
Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms as well as causing damage to buildings and having impacts on human health.

===Surface waters and aquatic animals===
[[File:Waterspecies.gif|thumb|This chart shows that not all fish, shellfish, or the insects that they eat can tolerate the same amount of acid; for example, frogs can tolerate water that is more acidic (i.e., has a lower pH) than trout.]]
Both the lower pH and higher aluminium concentrations in surface water that occur as a result of acid rain can cause damage to fish and other aquatic animals. At pHs lower than 5 most fish eggs will not hatch and lower pHs can kill adult fish. As lakes and rivers become more acidic biodiversity is reduced. Acid rain has eliminated insect life and some fish species, including the [[brook trout]] in some lakes, streams, and creeks in geographically sensitive areas, such as the Adirondack Mountains of the United States.&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;US EPA: [http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/surface_water.html Effects of Acid Rain – Surface Waters and Aquatic Animals]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the extent to which acid rain contributes directly or indirectly via runoff from the catchment to lake and river acidity (i.e., depending on characteristics of the surrounding watershed) is variable. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) website states: "Of the lakes and streams surveyed, acid rain caused acidity in 75% of the acidic lakes and about 50% of the acidic streams".&lt;ref name="EPA"/&gt; Lakes hosted by silicate basement rocks are more acidic than lakes within limestone or other basement rocks with a carbonate composition (i.e. marble) due to buffering effects by carbonate minerals, even with the same amount of acid rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mineral Resources, Economics and the Environment.|last=Kesler|first=Stephen|publisher=Cambridge University|year=2015|isbn=9781107074910|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Soils===
Soil biology and chemistry can be seriously damaged by acid rain. Some microbes are unable to tolerate changes to low pH and are killed.&lt;ref&gt;Rodhe, H., et al. The global distribution of acidifying wet deposition. Environmental Science and TEchnology. vlo. 36, no. 20 (October) p.&amp;nbsp;4382–8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[enzyme]]s of these microbes are [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] (changed in shape so they no longer function) by the acid. The hydronium ions of acid rain also mobilize [[toxin]]s, such as aluminium, and leach away essential nutrients and minerals such as [[magnesium]].&lt;ref name="EPA: Forests"&gt;US EPA: [http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/forests.html Effects of Acid Rain – Forests] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726034352/http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/forests.html |date=July 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil chemistry can be dramatically changed when base cations, such as calcium and magnesium, are leached by acid rain thereby affecting sensitive species, such as [[sugar maple]] ([[Acer saccharum]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The biogeochemistry of sulfur at Hubbard Brook|url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/mitchell/Class%20Readings/BioGeo60.235.316.pdf|doi=10.1023/A:1020972100496|year=2002|last1=Likens|first1=G.E.|last2=Driscoll|first2=C.T.|last3=Buso|first3=D.C.|last4=Mitchell|first4=M.J.|last5=Lovett|first5=G.M.|last6=Bailey|first6=S.W.|last7=Siccama|first7=T.G.|last8=Reiners|first8=W.A.|last9=Alewell|first9=C.|journal=Biogeochemistry|volume=60|issue=3|page=235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.272.5259.244|url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/mitchell/Class%20Readings/Sci.272.244.246.pdf|title=Long-Term Effects of Acid Rain: Response and Recovery of a Forest Ecosystem|year=1996|last1=Likens|first1=G.

===Forests and other vegetation===
[[File:Acid rain woods1.JPG|thumb|Acid rain can have severe effects on vegetation. A forest in the [[Black Triangle (region)|Black Triangle]] in Europe.]]
Adverse effects may be indirectly related to acid rain, like the acid's effects on soil (see above) or high concentration of gaseous precursors to acid rain. High altitude forests are especially vulnerable as they are often surrounded by clouds and fog which are more acidic than rain.

Other plants can also be damaged by acid rain, but the effect on food crops is minimized by the application of lime and fertilizers to replace lost nutrients. In cultivated areas, limestone may also be added to increase the ability of the soil to keep the pH stable, but this tactic is largely unusable in the case of wilderness lands. When calcium is leached from the needles of red spruce, these trees become less cold tolerant and exhibit winter injury and even death.&lt;ref&gt;DeHayes, D.H., Schaberg, P.G. and G.R. Strimbeck.

===Ocean acidification===
{{main|Ocean acidification}}
{{expand section|date=July 2013}}
Acid rain has a much less harmful effect on the oceans. However, acid rain can cause the oceans acidity to rise, making it more difficult for different coastal species to create their [[exoskeleton]]s that they need to survive. These coastal species link together as part of the ocean's food chain and without them being a source for other marine life to feed off of more marine life will die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windows2universe.org/headline_universe/olpa/acid_coasts_7sept07.html|title=Acid Rain Has Disproportionate Impact on Near-Shore Ocean Waters - Windows to the Universe|website=www.windows2universe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coral's limestone skeletal is sensitive to pH drop, because the [[calcium carbonate]], core component of the limestone dissolves in acidic (low pH) solutions.

===Human health effects===
Acid rain does not directly affect human health. The acid in the rainwater is too dilute to have direct adverse effects. However, the particulates responsible for acid rain (sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides) do have an adverse effect. Increased amounts of fine particulate matter in the air do contribute to heart and lung problems including [[asthma]] and [[bronchitis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/health.html Effects of Acid Rain – Human Health]. Epa.gov (2006-06-02). Retrieved on 2013-02-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other adverse effects===
[[File:Pollution - Damaged by acid rain.jpg|Effect of acid rain on statues|thumb|right]]
[[File:Skulptur aus Sandstein, Dresden 2012-09-06-0555.jpg|Acid rain and weathering|thumb|right]]
Acid rain can damage buildings, historic monuments, and statues, especially those made of rocks, such as [[limestone]] and [[marble]], that contain large amounts of calcium carbonate. Acids in the rain react with the calcium compounds in the stones to create gypsum, which then flakes off.

The effects of this are commonly seen on old gravestones, where acid rain can cause the inscriptions to become completely illegible. Acid rain also increases the [[corrosion]] rate of metals, in particular [[iron]], [[steel]], [[copper]] and [[bronze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m0441x12l06k5n23/ |title=ICP on effects on materials |accessdate=2010-11-18 |doi=10.1007/BF01186242 |volume=85 |issue=4 |journal=Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution |pages=2701–2706|bibcode=1995WASP...85.2701R |last1=Reisener |first1=A. |last2=Stäckle |first2=B. |last3=Snethlage |first3=R. |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/WP-89-104.pdf |title=Approaches in modeling the impact of air pollution-induced material degradation |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention methods==

===Technical solutions===
Many coal-firing [[power station]]s use [[flue-gas desulfurization|flue-gas desulphurization]] (FGD) to remove sulphur-containing gases from their stack gases. For a typical coal-fired power station, FGD will remove 95% or more of the SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the flue gases. An example of FGD is the wet scrubber which is commonly used. A wet scrubber is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot smoke stack gases from a power plant into the tower. Lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulphur dioxide present. The calcium carbonate of the limestone produces pH-neutral [[calcium sulfate]] that is physically removed from the scrubber. That is, the scrubber turns sulphur pollution into industrial sulfates.

In some areas the sulfates are sold to chemical companies as [[gypsum]] when the purity of calcium sulfate is high. In others, they are placed in [[landfill]]. However, the effects of acid rain can last for generations, as the effects of pH level change can stimulate the continued leaching of undesirable chemicals into otherwise pristine water sources, killing off vulnerable insect and fish species and blocking efforts to [[Restoration ecology|restore]] native life.

[[Fluidized bed combustion]] also reduces the amount of sulphur emitted by power production.

[[Vehicle emissions control]] reduces emissions of nitrogen oxides from motor vehicles.

===International treaties===
A number of international treaties on the long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants have been agreed for example, the [[1985 Helsinki Protocol on the Reduction of Sulphur Emissions]] under the [[Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]]. Canada and the US signed the [[Air Quality Agreement]] in 1991.  Most European countries and Canada have signed the treaties.

===Emissions trading===
{{main|Emissions trading}}
{{See also|Acid Rain Program}}
In this regulatory scheme, every current polluting facility is given or may purchase on an open market an emissions allowance for each unit of a designated pollutant it emits. Operators can then install pollution control equipment, and sell portions of their emissions allowances they no longer need for their own operations, thereby recovering some of the capital cost of their investment in such equipment. The intention is to give operators economic incentives to install pollution controls.

The first emissions trading market was established in the United States by enactment of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990]]&lt;ref&gt;Former Deputy Administrator Hank Habicht talks about management at EPA. An Interview with Hank Habicht [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=17 Video], [https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/60772C611F145A4D.pdf#page=6 Transcript] (see p6). December 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;. The overall goal of the Acid Rain Program established by the Act&lt;ref&gt;Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 42 ''U.S. Code'' 7651&lt;/ref&gt; is to achieve significant environmental and public health benefits through reductions in emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and nitrogen oxides (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), the primary causes of acid rain. To achieve this goal at the lowest cost to society, the program employs both regulatory and market based approaches for controlling air pollution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2196">An '''adaptation''' is a transfer of a work of art from one medium to another.

Some common examples are:
* [[Film adaptation]], a story from another work, adapted into a [[film]] (it may be a novel, non-fiction like journalism, autobiography, comic books, scriptures, plays or historical sources)
* [[Literary adaptation]], a story from a literary source, adapted into another work{{cn|date=March 2018}}
* [[Theatrical adaptation]], a story from another work, adapted into a [[play (theatre)|play]]

There is, however, no end to potential media involved in adaptation. Adaptation is the practice of transcoding (changing the code or 'language' used in a medium) as well as the assimilation of a work of art to other cultural, linguistic, semiotic, aesthetic or other norms. Recent approaches to the expanding field Adaptation Studies reflect these expansion of our perspective. Adaptation occurs as a special case of intertextual and intermedial exchange and the copy-paste culture of digital technologies has produced "new intertextual forms engendered by emerging technologies—mashups, remixes, reboots, samplings, remodelings, transformations— " that "further develop the impulse to adapt and appropriate, and the ways in which they challenge the theory and practice of adaptation and appropriation."&lt;ref&gt;Voigts, Eckart.

'''Authenticity in art''' is the different ways in which a [[work of art]] or an artistic performance may be considered authentic.{{sfn|Davies|Higgins|Hopkins|2009|pp=156}}
[[Denis Dutton]] distinguishes between ''nominal authenticity'' and ''expressive authenticity''.
The first refers to the correct identification of the author of a work of art, to how closely a performance of a play or piece of music conforms to the author's intention, or to how closely a work of art conforms to an artistic tradition.
The second sense refers to how much the work possesses original or inherent authority, how much sincerity, genuineness of expression, and moral passion the artist or performer puts into the work.{{sfn|Dutton|2003|pp=258ff}}

A quite different concern is the authenticity of the experience, which may be impossible to achieve. A modern visitor to a museum may not only see an object in a very different context from that which the artist intended, but may be unable to understand important aspects of the work. The authentic experience may be impossible to recapture.{{sfn|Phillips|1997|pp=1-4}}

Authenticity is a requirement for inscription upon the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]].{{sfn|UNESCO|2011|pp=21f}} According to the ''Nara Document on Authenticity'', it can be expressed through 'form and design; materials and substance; use and function; traditions and techniques; location and setting; spirit and feeling; and other internal and external factors.'{{sfn|Larsen 1995}}{{sfn|Larsen 1994}}

==Authenticity of provenance==
Authenticity of provenance means that the origin or authorship of a work of art has been correctly identified.{{sfn|Potter|2010|pp=78}}
As [[Lionel Trilling]] points out in his 1972 book ''Sincerity and Authenticity'', the question of authenticity of provenance has acquired a profoundly moral dimension. Regardless of the appearance of the object or the quality of workmanship, there is great importance in knowing whether a vase is a genuine [[Ming vase]] or just a clever [[Art forgery|forgery]].{{sfn|Potter|2010|pp=9}}
This intense interest in authenticity is relatively recent and is largely confined to the western world. In the medieval period, and in countries such as modern Thailand, there was or is little interest in the identity of the artist.{{sfn|Abbing|2002|pp=110}}

The case of [[Han van Meegeren]] is well known. After failing to succeed as an artist in his own right, he turned to creating fake [[Vermeer]] paintings. These were accepted as genuine by experts and acclaimed as masterpieces. After being arrested for selling national treasures to the Germans, he caused a sensation when he publicly demonstrated that he was the artist.{{sfn|Potter|2010|pp=85}}
To guard against forgeries like this, a [[certificate of authenticity]] may be used to prove that a work of art is authentic, but there is a sizable market in fake certificates.{{sfn|Potter|2010|pp=87}}
Furthermore a combination of art historical, conservational and technical evidence can be used to authenticate a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://authenticationinart.org/|title=Authentication in Art|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The financial importance of authenticity may bias collectors to acquiring recent works of art where provenance can more easily be proven, perhaps even by a statement from the artist.{{sfn|McAndrew|2010|pp=56}}
For older works, an increasingly sophisticated array of forensic techniques may be deployed to establish authenticity of provenance.{{sfn|Fleming|1975|pp=567}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://observer.com/2017/11/leonardo-da-vinci-salvator-mundi-goes-to-auction-at-christies/|title=Christie’s da Vinci Auction Reveals Why Forgers Love to Fake Masters|date=2017-11-15|work=Observer|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]] discusses at length the question raised by [[Aline B. Saarinen]]: "If a fake is so expert that even after the most thorough and trustworthy examination its authenticity is still open to doubt, is it or is it not as satisfactory a work of art as if it were unequivocally genuine?" Goodman concludes that the question is academic, since there must be some way to distinguish a forgery from the original, and once the forgery is known for what it is, that knowledge alters the perception of value.{{sfn|Goodman|1976|pp=99}}
However, [[Arthur Koestler]] in ''[[The Act of Creation]]'' answers that if a forgery fits into an artist's body of work and produces the same kind of aesthetic pleasure as other works by that artist, there is no reason to exclude it from a museum.{{sfn|Koestler|1964|pp=400ff}}

The question of the value of a forgery may be irrelevant to a curator, since they are concerned only with the provenance of the work and not with its artistic merit.{{sfn|Goodman|1976|pp=119}}
Even for the curator, in many cases provenance is a matter of probabilities rather than a certainty - absolute proof is not possible.{{sfn|McGowan|2000|pp=230}}
But once a forgery has been exposed, no matter how highly the work was praised when it was thought to be "authentic" there is rarely any interest in evaluating the work on its own merit.{{sfn|Schefold|2002}}
[[File:Josquin des Prez.jpg|thumb|right|Facsimile of a 1611 [[woodcut]] of the composer [[Josquin des Prez]], copied from a now-lost oil painting done during his lifetime{{sfn|Macey|2010}}]]

Reproduction is inherent to some forms of art. In Medieval Europe, an artist might create a drawing which was used by another craftsman to create a [[woodcut]] block. The drawing was usually destroyed in the block-cutting process, and the block was thrown away when it became worn out. The copies printed from the block are all that remain of the work.{{sfn|Hind|1935|pp=88ff}}
In a 1936 essay, [[Walter Benjamin]] discussed the new media of photography and film, in which the work of art can be reproduced many times with no one version being the authentic "original". He linked this shift from authentic objects to broadly accessible mass media with a transformation in the function of art from ritual to politics.{{sfn|Benjamin|1936}}
Modern art may raise new issues of authenticity of provenance. For example, the artist [[Duane Hanson]] instructed the conservators of his 1971 sculpture ''Sunbather'' to feel free to replace elements such as the bathing cap or swimsuit if they became faded.{{sfn|Spencer|2004|pp=129}}
As [[Julian H. Scaff]] points out, the computer and the internet further confuse the issue of authenticity of provenance, since a digital work of art may exist in thousands or millions of identical versions, and in variants where there is no way to determine the original version or even the author.{{sfn|Scaff}}

==Cultural authenticity==

Authenticity of provenance is concerned with identifying the person who made the work, or at least pinning down the place and time in which the work was made as closely as possible. Cultural authenticity, or authenticity of style or tradition, is concerned with whether a work is a genuine expression of an artistic tradition, even when the author may be anonymous. Interest in this form of authenticity may be associated with a romantic sense of the value of the pure, unadulterated tradition, often linked to nationalistic and possibly racist beliefs.{{sfn|Bendix|1997|pp=6ff}}

A work of art may be considered an authentic example of a traditional culture or genre when it conforms to the style, materials, process of creation and other essential attributes of that genre.
Many traditions are thought to be "owned" by an ethnic group, and work in that genre is only considered authentic if it is created by a member of that group. Thus [[Inuit art]] can only be considered authentic if created by an [[Inuit people|Inuit]]. This may help to protect the originators of an art tradition from [[cultural appropriation]], but there is a racist aspect to the view as described by Joel Rudinow in his essay ''Race, Ethnicity, Expressive Authenticity: Can White People Sing the Blues?''{{sfn|Coleman|2005|pp=31ff}}

The market for "[[primitive art]]" developed in the western world towards the end of the 19th century as explorers or colonialists came into contact with formerly unknown cultural groups in Africa, Asia and the Pacific. These people quickly learned how to incorporate new materials supplied by traders into their art, such as cloth and glass beads, but found that they could not sell these "inauthentic" objects. However, they learned how to manufacture works from local materials that would be considered authentic for sale to the westerners.{{sfn|Scharfstein|2009|pp=99-100}}
This process of creating art that will be considered authentic by western buyers continues to this day. The objects may be designed or modified to give the impression of having popular attributes and provenance, including religious or ritual uses, antiquity and association with royalty.{{sfn|Carrier|2005|pp=281}}
Similarly, in the 1940s [[Haiti]]an professional artists began to create imitations of images provided by foreign entrepreneurs. The images represented the foreigners' view of the essence of [[Haitian Vodou art]]. The Haitian works were later claimed to be authentic.{{sfn|Richman|2008|p=203}}

[[File:Ifugao sculpture Louvre 70-1999-4-1.jpg|thumb|[[Bulul]] guardian figure of the Ifugao people. Wood and sacrificial remains, northern Luzón Island (Philippines), 15th century.]]
To distinguish from crude objects made for the tourist trade, many collectors consider that a work is only an authentic example of a traditional genre if it meets certain standards of quality and was made for the original purpose. Dutton gives the example of the [[Igorot]] of northern [[Luzon]] who have long created figurines (''[[bulul]]'') for use in traditional ceremonies, but today produce them primarily for the tourist trade. An Igorot family may purchase a roughly carved ''bulul'' from a tourist booth and use it for traditional ceremonies, thus giving authenticity to the work that would not, perhaps, be present otherwise.{{sfn|Dutton|2003|pp=258ff}}
Although collectors place greater value on "tribal" masks or sculptures that have been used in an active ritual, it may be impossible to prove whether this is the case. Even if a video shows the mask being worn in a ritual dance, the dance may have been staged for tourists. Yet if the provenance of the mask is proven, if the mask was made by a member of the society using traditional designs and techniques, it is presumably an authentic example of the style or tradition.{{sfn|van der Grijp|2009|pp=317}}

It is not always clear what constitutes a style. For example, production of [[Zimbabwe]]an stone sculptures is relatively recent, dating to the 1950s. It does not draw on any earlier tradition. However, the sculpture plays an important role in establishing the existence of a uniquely Zimbabwean culture, and the authenticity of this style is strongly emphasized by the government of Zimbabwe despite the difficulty of defining its characteristics.{{sfn|Baaz|Palmberg|2001|pp=183ff}}
[[Navajo people|Navajo]] [[Sandpainting|sand paintings]] raise a different issue. The traditional paintings must be destroyed on completion of the ritual in which they are used. However, Navajo artists create sand paintings for sale with slightly modified designs. Can these paintings be considered authentic examples of Navajo art?{{sfn|Davies|Higgins|Hopkins|2009|pp=159}}

Traditions change. In an exploration of the evolution of the art of the [[Maroon people]] of [[French Guiana]], [[Sally Price]] shows that contemporary styles have developed through a complex interaction between artists and buyers. The Maroons have a long tradition of artwork, primarily in the form of decoration of everyday objects such as paddles or shutters. This art was purely aesthetic in purpose, with no symbolic meaning. However, European collectors needed to assign symbolism to "native art". Over time, the Maroon artists have come to accept the European [[semiotic]] vocabulary and to assign symbolism to their work, which younger artists may believe to be based on ancestral traditions. The artists have also moved into new media and new designs. Their art may still be considered authentic examples of Maroon art, but the art form and the meaning associated with it is new.{{sfn|Price|2007}}

==Authenticity of performance==

[[File:Diakonie-kantorei.jpg|thumb|An ensemble performing [[Baroque music]] with authentic instruments and techniques, but in modern dress and setting.]]
With performance arts such as music and theater, both the composer or playwright and the performers are involved in creating an instance of the work. There are some who consider that a performance is only truly authentic if it approximates as closely as possible what the original author would have expected to see and hear. In a [[historically informed performance]], the actors or musicians will make every effort to achieve this effect by using replicas of historical instruments, studying historical guides to acting and so on. They would consider, for example, that a performance of one of [[Mozart]]'s piano concertos would be "inauthentic" if played on a modern concert [[grand piano]], an instrument that would have been unknown to the composer.{{sfn|Dutton|2003|pp=258ff}}

Others would not take such a rigorous view. For example, they would accept a performance of a play by [[Shakespeare]] as authentic even if the female parts were played by women rather than boys, and if the words were spoken with modern pronunciation rather than with the pronunciation of the [[Elizabethan era]], which would be difficult for a modern audience to understand.{{sfn|Dutton|2003|pp=258ff}}

==Authenticity of expression==

Dutton's concept of expressive authenticity is based on the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' alternative definition of "possessing original or inherent authority". In this sense, authenticity is a measure of the degree to which the artist's work is a committed, personal expression rather than derived from other work. It includes concepts of originality, honesty and integrity.
In the case of a musical performance, authenticity of expression may conflict with authenticity of performance. The player is true to their personal musical sense and does not imitate someone else's method of playing. Their performance may thus differ significantly from that of a player attempting to follow the style common at the time the musical work was composed.{{sfn|Dutton|2003|pp=258ff}}

[[File:TinaTurner&amp;Clapton.jpg|thumb|[[Tina Turner]] and [[Eric Clapton]] (1987), both known for authenticity of expression rather than authenticity of tradition.]]
Expressive authenticity is related to the technical term ''[[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]]'' as used in [[existential philosophy]]. It has always been thought right to know oneself and to act accordingly, and in existential psychology this form of authenticity is seen as central to mental health.{{sfn|Wood et al.}}
Prominent artists such as the [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]] [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Arshile Gorky]], and [[Willem de Kooning]] have been understood in existentialist terms, as have [[filmmaker]]s such as [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[Ingmar Bergman]].{{sfn|Crowell|2010}}
The greater popularity of performer-based music as opposed to composition-based music is relatively recent. It seems to reflect a growing interest in expressive authenticity, and thus in musicians who have a unique and charismatic style.{{sfn|Abbing|2002|pp=173}}

The question of whether an artistic work is an authentic expression depends on the artist's background, beliefs and ideals. [[Andrew Potter]] cites the example of [[Avril Lavigne]], a teenage singer from [[Napanee]], [[Ontario]] who burst onto the pop music scene in 2002. She claimed to be a small-town skateboarder, with her background providing the subjects of her songs, and said these songs were her own compositions. These claims of authenticity of expression and of provenance were both challenged. However, her work could have been authentic in expression even if Lavigne had not written it, or authentic in provenance if she had written it but not authentic in expression if the carefully cultivated skater-girl image were false.{{sfn|Potter|2010|pp=79ff}}
 
Authenticity of expression may thus be linked with authenticity of style or tradition.
Many feel it is not permissible for someone to speak in the voice of another culture or racial background, and that such an expression cannot be authentic.{{sfn|Potter|2010|pp=79ff}}
For example, [[hip hop]] was originally an art form through which underprivileged minorities in the [[United States]] protested against their condition. As it has become less of an underground culture, there is debate over whether the spirit of hip hop can survive in a marketable integrated version.{{sfn|Rose|1994|pp=39-40}}
In "Authenticity Within Hip Hop and Other Cultures Threatened with Assimilation," [[Kembrew McLeod]] argues that hip hop culture is threatened with assimilation by a larger, mainstream culture, and that authenticity of expression in this genre is being lost.{{sfn|McLeod|1999}}

==Authenticity of experience==

[[File:British Museum Asia 45.jpg|thumb|An 8th-century AD statue of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] goddess [[Tara (Ramayana)|Tara]] from [[Sri Lanka]] in a very different setting from the original]]
A quite different concern is the authenticity of the experience, which may be impossible to achieve. A modern visitor to a museum may not only see an object in a very different context from that which the artist intended, but also may be unable to understand important aspects of the work. The authentic experience may be impossible to recapture. A curator may accept this, perhaps attempting to present the works of art in their authentic condition, but accepting that the artificial setting and lighting are legitimate in providing a contemporary experience of the artwork, even if this experience cannot be "authentic".{{sfn|Phillips|1997|pp=1-4}}

Dutton discusses the importance of the audience, giving a hypothetical example based on ''[[La Scala]]'', the famous [[Milan]] opera house. He imagines that the natural audience, informed aficionados of the opera, lose interest and cease to attend, but the performances continue to be given to tourists who have no understanding of the work they are experiencing. In another example, he quotes a Pacific Island dancer saying "Culture? That's what we do for the tourists." In both cases, although the performances may be authentic in the sense of being true to the original, the authenticity of the experience is open to debate.{{sfn|Dutton|2003|pp=258ff}}

'''Blasticidin S''' is an [[antibiotic]] that is produced by ''[[Streptomyces griseochromogenes]]''.  In biological research, specifically [[genetic engineering]], it is used to select transformed cells which have been engineered to carry a resistance gene for blasticidin.  In short, [[DNA]] of interest is fused to DNA encoding a resistance gene, and then is transformed into cells.  After allowing time for recovery and for cells to begin transcribing and translating their new DNA, blasticidin is added.  Now only the cells that have the new DNA can grow.

== History ==
In the 1950s, a drug screening program was designed in [[Japan]] to discover a new antibiotic that prevents [[Magnaporthe grisea|Blast Disease]] by the [[fungus]] ''[[Magnaporthe grisea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Natural Products Isolation: Separation Methods for Antimicrobials, Antivirals, and Enzyme Inhibitors. Wagman G. H., Elsevier R. C.; p. 191 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resistance genes ==
Three resistance genes have been cloned:

*  bls (an [[acetyltransferase]]), isolated from ''[[Streptoverticillium]] sp.'', which itself produces blasticidin in a natural example of biological warfare.
* bsr (a [[blasticidin-S deaminase]]), isolated from ''[[Bacillus cereus]]'' (other bsr genes are known as well, see listings in [[Genbank]]).
* BSD (another [[deaminase]]), isolated from ''[[Aspergillus terreus]]''.

bsr and BSD are the most commonly used resistance genes.  The proteins produced from these genes enable the cells carrying them to produce proteins in the presence of blasticidin.

== Mechanism of action ==
Blasticidin prevents the growth of both [[eukaryotic]] and [[prokaryotic]] cells.  It works by inhibiting termination step of translation and peptide bond formation (to lesser extent) by the [[ribosome]].  This means that cells can no longer produce new proteins through [[translation (genetics)|translation]] of [[mRNA]].

'''CLUPI''' ('''Close-UP Imager''') is a miniaturized camera system on board the planned [[European Space Agency]] [[ExoMars rover]]. CLUPI was designed to acquire high-resolution [[close-up]] images in colour of soils, outcrops, rocks, drill fines and drill core samples,&lt;ref name='CLUPI home'&gt; [http://exploration.esa.int/mars/45103-rover-instruments/?fbodylongid=2301 The ExoMars Rover Instrument Suite: CLUPI - Close-UP Imager]. [[ESA]]. Accessed 30 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as and the search for potential [[biosignature]] structures and patterns.&lt;ref name='Josset 2017'&gt; "The Close-Up Imager Onboard the ESA ExoMars Rover: Objectives, Description, Operations, and Science Validation Activities". Josset J.-L., et al., [[Astrobiology (journal)|Astrobiology]]. July 2017, 17(6-7), 595-611. {{doi|10.1089/ast.2016.1546}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This camera assembly is part of the science payload on board the [[European Space Agency]]{{'s}} [[ExoMars rover]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.space.com/34664-exomars-facts.html ExoMars: Searching for Life on Mars]. Elizabeth Howell, ''Space.com''. March 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; tasked to search for [[biosignature]]s and [[biomarker]]s on Mars. The rover is planned to be launched in July 2020 and [[Mars landing|land on Mars]] in March 2021.

==Overview==
The CLUPI instrument is being developed by a Swiss–French consortium supported by the [[Swiss Space Office]] and the [[French Space Agency]] (CNES). Its [[Principal Investigator]] is Jean-Luc Josset, from the Swiss Space Office in Switzerland. Frances Westall and Beda Hofmann are Co-PIs.&lt;ref name='Josset 2017'/&gt; The science team includes scientists from Canada, Europe and Russia, especially for [[biosignature]] recognition.&lt;ref name='Josset 2017'/&gt;  Instrument field tests started in 2009 with preliminary CLUPI systems tested during several Arctic winters.&lt;ref name='Josset 2017'/&gt; 

CLUPI will be mounted on the movable rover's drill box and it will acquire high-resolution, close-up images in colour of the texture, structure and morphology of rocks and soil.&lt;ref name='CLUPI home'/&gt; The resolution will be similar to what geologists would obtain by using a hand-held magnifying lens:&lt;ref name='Josset 2017'/&gt;  at a distance of 10 cm from the target, the maximum resolution is 7 µm/pixel.&lt;ref name='CLUPI home'/&gt;  Its [[field of view]] can be changed by the use of two fixed mirrors – one flat (FOV2) and one concave (FOV3). The CLUPI visual images will complement those provided by [[PanCam]] to provide the context necessary for interpretation of mineralogy and potential visible biosignatures.&lt;ref name='Josset 2017'/&gt;

CLUPI will observe the drilling area very closely from different angles to help characterise rock structures such as embedded crystals and fractures. After the drill has been used and retracted, CLUPI will be used to image the amount and appearance of dislodged fines. From the high position, the camera will be able to observe the borehole to a depth of approximately 10 cm, depending on the local illumination conditions.&lt;ref name='CLUPI home'/&gt; Then, CLUPI will be used to image the collected core prior to delivery to the rovers' internal analytical instruments for further processing and analyses. &lt;ref name='CLUPI home'/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4642">A '''chemotype''' (sometimes '''chemovar''') is a chemically distinct entity in a [[plant]] or [[microorganism]], with differences in the composition of the [[secondary metabolites]]. Minor [[Genetics|genetic]] and [[epigenetic]] changes with little or no effect on morphology or anatomy may produce large changes in the chemical [[phenotype]]. Chemotypes are often defined by the most abundant chemical produced by that individual and the concept has been useful in work done by chemical ecologists and natural product chemists. With respect to plant biology, the term "chemotype" was first coined by Dr. Rolf Santesson and his son Johan in 1968, defined as, "...chemically characterized parts of a population of morphologically indistinguishable individuals."&lt;ref name="Keefover-Ring 2009"&gt;Keefover-Ring K, Thompson JD, and Linhart YB. 2009. Beyond six scents: defining a seventh ''Thymus vulgaris'' chemotype new to southern France by ethanol extraction. ''Flavour and Fragrance Journal'', 24(3): 117-122. [[doi:10.1002/ffj.1921]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In microbiology, the term "chemoform" or "chemovar" is preferred in the 1990 edition of the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria]]'' (ICNB), the former referring to the chemical constitution of an organism and the latter meaning "production or amount of production of a particular chemical." Terms with the suffix -type are discouraged so as to avoid confusion with [[Type (biology)|type specimens]].&lt;ref name="ICNB"&gt;Lapage SP, Sneath PHA, Lessel EF, et al., editors. 1992. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8812/ Appendix 10B. Infrasubspecific Terms.] ''International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria: Bacteriological Code'', 1990 Revision. Washington (DC): ASM Press; 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms chemotype and chemovar were originally introduced to the ICNB in a proposed revision to one of the nomenclatural rules dealing with [[Taxonomic rank|infrasubspecific]] taxonomic subdivisions at the 1962 meeting of the International Microbiological Congress in Montreal. The proposed change argued that nomenclatural regulation of these ranks, such as serotype and morphotype, is necessary to avoid confusion. In proposed recommendation 8a(7), it was asked that "authorization be given for the use of the terms chemovar and chemotype," defining the terms as being "used to designate an infrasubspecific subdivision to include infrasubspecific forms or strains characterized by the production of some chemical not normally produced by the type strain of the species." The change to the Code was approved in August 1962 by the Judicial Commission of the International Committee of Bacteriological Nomenclature at the VIII International Microbiological Congress in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;Clark WA, and Seeliger HPR. 1963. Detailed minutes concerning actions taken in the emendation of the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria and Viruses during the meetings of the Judicial Commission of the International Committee of Bacteriological Nomenclature at the VIII International Microbiological Congress in Montreal August, 1962. ''[[International Bulletin of Bacteriological Nomenclature and Taxonomy]]'', 13(1): 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

A good example of a plant with many [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] chemotypes is ''[[Thymus vulgaris]]''. While largely indistinguishable in appearance, specimens of ''T.&amp;nbsp;vulgaris'' may be assigned to one of seven different chemotypes, depending on whether the dominant component of the [[essential oil]] is [[thymol]], [[carvacrol]], [[linalool]], [[geraniol]], [[sabinene hydrate]] (thuyanol), [[terpineol|α-terpineol]], or [[eucalyptol]]. Such chemotypes may be indicated as ''Thymus&amp;nbsp;vulgaris'' ct. thymol (red thyme), or ''Thymus&amp;nbsp;vulgaris'' ct. geraniol (sweet thyme), etc. Such an indication has no taxonomic standing.&lt;ref name="Keefover-Ring 2009" /&gt;

Because chemotypes are defined only by the most abundant secondary metabolite, they may have little practical meaning as a group of organisms sharing the same trait. Individuals of one chemotype may have vastly different chemical profiles, varying in the abundance of kind of the next most abundant chemical. This means two individuals of the same chemotype could have different impacts on herbivores, pollinators, or resistance to pests. A study by Ken Keefover-Ring and colleagues in 2008 cautioned that, "...this can be a very qualitative assessment of an individual's chemical profile, under which may be hiding significant chemical diversity."&lt;ref name="Keefover-Ring 2009" /&gt;

[[Image:Waveformoriginal.png|right|thumb|Original signal]]
[[Image:Waveformcompanded.png|right|thumb|After compressing, before expanding]]

In [[telecommunication]] and [[signal processing]] '''companding''' (occasionally called '''compansion''') is a method of mitigating the detrimental effects of a channel with limited [[dynamic range]]. The name is a [[portmanteau]] of the words [[dynamic range compression|'''com'''pressing]] and ex'''panding'''. The use of companding allows signals with a large dynamic range to be transmitted over facilities that have a smaller dynamic range capability. Companding is employed in [[telephony]] and other audio applications such as professional [[wireless microphone]]s and [[analog recording]].

==How it works==
While the [[dynamic range compression]] used in audio recording and the like depends on a [[variable-gain amplifier]], and so is a locally linear process (linear for short regions, but not globally), companding is [[non-linear]] and takes place in the same way at all points in time.  The dynamic range of a signal is compressed before [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] and is expanded to the original value at the receiver.

The electronic circuit that does this is called a '''compander''' and works by compressing or expanding the [[dynamic range]] of an analog electronic signal such as sound recorded by a microphone.  One variety is a triplet of amplifiers: a logarithmic amplifier, followed by a variable-gain linear amplifier and an exponential amplifier.  Such a triplet has the property that its output voltage is proportional to the input voltage raised to an adjustable power.

Companded quantization is the combination of three functional building blocks – namely, a (continuous-domain) signal [[Dynamic range compression|dynamic range ''compressor'']], a limited-range uniform quantizer, and a (continuous-domain) signal dynamic range ''expander'' that inverts the compressor function. This type of quantization is frequently used in telephony systems.&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;W. R. Bennett, "[http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/bstj/vol27-1948/articles/bstj27-3-446.pdf Spectra of Quantized Signals]", ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]'', Vol. 27, pp. 446–472, July 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GrayNeuhoff&gt;[[Robert M. Gray]] and David L. Neuhoff, "Quantization", ''[[IEEE Transactions on Information Theory]]'', Vol. IT-44, No. 6, pp. 2325–2383, Oct. 1998. {{doi|10.1109/18.720541}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In practice, companders are designed to operate according to relatively simple dynamic range compressor functions that are designed to be suitable for implementation using simple analog electronic circuits. The two most popular compander functions used for telecommunications are the [[A-law algorithm|A-law]] and [[μ-law algorithm|μ-law]] functions.

==Applications==
Companding is used in digital telephony systems, compressing before input to an [[analog-to-digital converter]], and then expanding after a [[digital-to-analog converter]].  This is equivalent to using a non-linear ADC as in a [[T-carrier]] telephone system that implements [[A-law]] or [[μ-law]] companding.  This method is also used in digital file formats for better [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) at lower bit rates.  For example, a linearly encoded 16-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] signal can be converted  to an 8-bit [[WAV]] or [[au file format|AU]] file while maintaining a decent SNR by compressing before the transition to 8-bit and expanding after a conversion back to 16-bit.  This is effectively a form of lossy [[audio data compression]].

Professional [[wireless microphone]]s do this since the dynamic range of the microphone audio signal itself is larger than the dynamic range provided by radio transmission. Companding also reduces the noise and crosstalk levels at the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/site/490e7be64dfcaa53/index.html A description of companding in wireless microphones]&lt;/ref&gt;

Companders are used in concert audio systems and in some noise reduction schemes such as [[dbx (noise reduction)|dbx]] and [[Dolby noise-reduction system|Dolby NR (all versions)]].

==History==
The use of companding in an analog picture transmission system was patented by A. B. Clark of [[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph|AT&amp;T]] in 1928 (filed in 1925):&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent

B. Clark patent}}

In 1942, Clark and his team completed the [[SIGSALY]] secure voice transmission system that included the first use of companding in a [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] (digital) system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Wireless Security: Models, Threats, and Solutions | author = Randall K.

In 1953, B. Smith showed that a nonlinear [[digital-to-analog converter|DAC]] could be complemented by the inverse nonlinearity in a successive-approximation [[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]] configuration, simplifying the design of digital companding systems.&lt;ref&gt;B. Smith, "Instantaneous Companding of Quantized Signals," ''Bell System Technical Journal'', Vol. 36, May 1957, pp. 653–709.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, H. Kaneko developed the uniform description of segment (piecewise linear) companding laws that had by then been adopted in digital telephony.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kaneko, "A Unified Formulation of Segment Companding Laws and Synthesis of Codecs and Digital Compandors," ''Bell System Technical Journal'', Vol. 49, September 1970, pp. 1555–1558.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s (and '90s), many of the music equipment manufacturers ([[Roland Corporation|Roland]], [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]], [[Korg]]) used companding when compressing the library waveform data in their [[Digital synthesizer|digital synthesizers]]. This dates back to the late '80s when memory chips were often one of the most costly components in the instrument. Manufacturers usually quoted the amount of memory in its compressed form: i.e. 24 MB of physical waveform ROM in a [[Korg Trinity]] is actually 48 MB when uncompressed. Similarly, Roland SR-JV expansion boards were usually advertised as 8 MB boards with '16 MB-equivalent content'. Careless copying of this technical information, omitting the "equivalence" reference, can often cause confusion.

'''Decalage''' on a [[fixed-wing aircraft]] is the angle difference between the upper and lower wings of a [[biplane]], i.e. the acute angle contained between the [[Chord (aircraft)|chords]] of the wings in question.

Decalage is said to be positive when the upper wing has a higher [[angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|angle of incidence]] than the lower wing, and negative when the lower wing's incidence is greater than that of the upper wing. Positive decalage results in greater lift from the upper wing than the lower wing, the difference increasing with the amount of decalage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aerade.cranfield.ac.uk/ara/1927/naca-tn-269.pdf NACA technical report No.269] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716225431/http://aerade.cranfield.ac.uk/ara/1927/naca-tn-269.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }} ''The Distribution of Loads Between the Wings of a Biplane Having Decalage'' (November 1927), p.18. Retrieved on 9 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [http://a.moirier.free.fr/Conception/Formules%20sp%E9ciales/Biplans/The%20fine%20old%20art%20of%20rigging%20a%20biplane%2002.pdf survey of representative biplanes], real-life design decalage is typically zero, with both wings having equal incidence.  A notable exception is the Stearman PT-17, which has 4&amp;deg; of incidence in the lower wing, and 3&amp;deg; in the upper wing.  Considered from an aerodynamic perspective, it is desirable to have the forward-most wing stall first, which will induce a pitch-down moment, aiding in stall recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780123973085/content/APP-C1-DESIGN_OF_CONVENTIONAL_AIRCRAFT.pdf Appendix C1 to "General Aviation Aircraft Design" by Snorri Gudmundson; section C1.2, p.9]&lt;/ref&gt;  Biplane designers may use incidence to control stalling behavior, but may also use airfoil selection or other means to accomplish correct behavior.

Decalage angle can also refer to the difference in angle of the chord line of the wing and the chord line of the horizontal stabilizer. This is different from the [[angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|angle of incidence]], which refers to the angle of the wing chord to the longitudinal axis of the fuselage, without reference to the horizontal stabilizer.

A '''dialog manager''' (DM) is a component of a [[dialog system]] (DS), responsible for the state and flow of the conversation. Usually:

* The '''input''' to the DM is the human utterance, usually converted to some system-specific semantic representation by the [[Natural language understanding]] (NLU) component. For example, in a flight-planning dialog system, the input may look like "ORDER(from=TA,to=JER,date=2012-01-01)".
* The DM usually maintains some '''state''' variables, such as the dialog history, the latest unanswered question, etc., depending on the system.
* The '''output''' of the DM is a list of instructions to other parts of the dialog system, usually in a semantic representation, for example "TELL(flight-num=123,flight-time=12:34)". This semantic representation is usually converted to human language by the [[Natural language generation]] (NLG) component.

There are many different DMs that fulfill very different roles. There can even be several DM components in a single DS.

The only thing common to all DMs is that they are '''stateful''', in contrast to other parts of the DS (such as the NLU and NLG components), which are just stateless functions. The DM roles can roughly be divided into these groups:

# Input-control DMs, which enable context-dependent processing of the human utterances.
# Output-control DMs. which enable state-dependent generation of text.
# Strategic flow-control
# Tactic flow-control

== Input-control DM ==

The human '''input''' has different meanings depending on the context. For example, in a travel-planning DS:
* Computer: Where do you want to depart from?
** Human: Tel Aviv.
* Computer: Where do you want to arrive at?
** Human: Gaza.

The meaning of the city name depends on the previously asked question. A DM may keep that question in a state variable, and use it to convert "Tel Aviv" to "I want to depart from Tel Aviv", and convert "Gaza" to "I want to arrive at Gaza".

This function is on the border between NLU and DM: in some systems it's included in the NLU, such as the context-dependent rules of [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/695379 Milward (2000)]; while in other systems it is included in the DM, such as the '''NP resolution''' module of [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/7844079 Mirkovic and Cavedon (2005)].

Another function between the NLU and DM is, determining which input utterances are part of a single utterance. Here is an example from a job negotiation dialog:

* I offer a salary of 20,000 NIS
* and a car
* The pension conditions will be decided later

All three utterances are actually a single offer. For the second utterance, the word "and" is a clue, but for the third utterance the only possible clue is that it was said immediately after the second one. To understand this, the DM should probably keep a timestamp of each utterance.

== Output-control DM ==

The computer '''output''' may be made more natural, by remembering the dialog history. For example, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120626180801/http://vhtoolkit.ict.usc.edu/index.php/NPCEditor NPCEditor] (a framework for authoring characters that answer human questions) allows the author to define question-answer pairs, such that for each question there are several possible answers. The DM selects the best answer for the question, unless it was already used, in which case it selects the 2nd best answer, etc.

A similar feature exists in [http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6305/beyond_fa%C3%A7ade_pattern_matching_.php?page=1 ChatScript] (a framework for authoring chatter-bots):  Each time the DS uses a certain rule, the DM marks this rule as "used", so that it won't be used again.

A recent DS for technical assistance {{citation needed|date=September 2012}} uses advanced machine-learned rules to select the best terms for describing items. For example, if the DM notices that it's speaking with an adult, it will use terms such as "the left hand"; if it notices that it's speaking with a child, it will use less technical terms such as "the hand where you wear the clock".

This function is on the border between DM and NLG.

== Strategic flow-control DM ==

The main role of a DM is to decide what action the dialog agent should take at each point of the dialog.

A simple way to do this is to let the author completely specify the dialog structure. For example, a specification of a tutorial dialog structure may look like:

* Computer: "What forces act on the electron?"
** Human: "Electric force".
*** Computer: "Correct"
*** [go to next question]
* Computer: "What forces act on the mass?"
** Human: "Electric force".
*** Computer: "Incorrect, the mass has no charge".
*** [go to a tutorial about electricity]

The DM keeps a pointer to our current position in the script. The position is updated according to the human input.

There are many languages and frameworks that allow authors to specify dialog structures, such as: [https://web.archive.org/web/20120827035428/http://www.vxml.org/ VoiceXML] (optimized for speech dialogs), 
[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6305/beyond_fa%C3%A7ade_pattern_matching_.php?page=1 AIML, Facade and ChatScript] (optimized for chat-bots), [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/7844079 CDM] (Java-based, optimized for device-control dialogs), and [http://www.learnlab.org/technologies/tutalk/index.php TuTalk] (optimized for tutorial dialogs).

Additionally, the dialog structure can be described as a state-chart, using a standard language such as [[SCXML]]. This is done in [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/7885526 DomainEditor] (a framework for [[tactical questioning]] characters).

It is quite tedious for authors to write a full dialog structure. There are many improvements that allow authors to describe a dialog in a higher abstraction level, while putting more burden on the DM.

=== Hierarchical structure ===
[http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/4907954 Ravenclaw] (a DM for goal-oriented dialogs, based on the CMU communicator) allows the author an advanced, multi-level dialog structure description, such as:

* Room reservation task:
** Login
*** Ask user name
*** Ask user password
** Room selection
*** Building selection
*** Room number selection
** Time selection
** Finish

The Ravenclaw DM keeps a stack of dialog modules, and uses it to process the human input.

This structure encourages code reuse, for example, the login module can be used in other dialogs.

They also [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dbohus/ravenclaw-olympus/research.html claim] to allow dynamic dialog-task construction, where the structure is not fixed in advance but constructed on the fly, based on information selected from a backend. For instance, in a system that helps aircraft maintenance personnel throughout the execution of maintenance tasks, the structure of the dialog depends on the structure of the maintenance task and is constructed dynamically.

=== Topic tracking ===

Frameworks for chatter-bots, such as ChatScript, allow to control the conversation structure with '''topics'''. The author can create rules that capture the topic that

* topic: CHILDHOOD (child boy girl young)
* t: I had a happy childhood.
* t: But it ended too early.
* ...

If the human says one of the words in parentheses, the DM remembers that the topic is "CHILDHOOD". The chat-bot now starts telling the story under the "CHILDHOOD" title, as long as the bot is in control of the conversation (the user passively responds by saying thinks like "OK" or "right"). Yet if the user asks questions, the system can either respond directly, or use up a line of the story it was going to say anyway.

This, too, allows authors to reuse topics, and combine several independent topics to create a smarter chatter-bot.

=== Form Filling ===
A common use of dialog systems is as a replacement to forms. For example, a flight-reservation agent should ask the human about his origin time and place, and destination time and place - just as if the human is filling a form with these 4 slots.

A simple solution is to use '''system-initiative''', where the dialog system asks the user about each piece of information in turn, and the user must fill them in that exact order, like in this dialog (from a presentation by [[David Traum]]):

* Welcome to the flight confirmation system. What is your flight number?
** United 123 on August 8 from Los Angeles
* What is your departure city?
** I told you, Los Angeles, on August 8
* I'm sorry, I didn't understand. What is your departure city?
** Los Angeles leaving August 8th.
* What is the day of departure?
** You don't listen! August 8!
* Please say the day of departure?
** August 8
* Flight United 123 confirmed to depart Los Angeles for London at 2pm on August 8.

The opposite of system-initiative is '''user-initiative''', where the user takes lead, and the system respond to whatever the user directs.

A common compromise between the two methods is '''mixed-initiative''', where the system starts with asking questions, but users can barge in and change the dialog direction. The system understands the user even when he speaks about details he was not asked about yet.

However, describing such a system manually, as a state-chart, is very tedious, since the human may first say the origin and then the destination, or vice versa. In each of them, the human may first say the time and then the place, or vice versa.

So, there are DMs that allow the dialog author to just say what information is required, without specifying the exact order. For example, the author may write:

* TRAVEL = {ORIGIN-PLACE, ORIGIN-TIME, DESTINATION-PLACE, DESTINATION-TIME}

The DM keeps track of which slots are already filled and which slots are still empty, and navigates the conversation in order to collect the missing information. For example, the DM may ask the human about the origin place first, but if the human adds the destination place, the DM will keep the information and not ask about it again.

Such DSs were developed in [[MIT]], for example, Wheels (for searching used car ads), Jupiter (for retrieving weather forecasts), and more.

Simple DMs handle slot-filling binarily: either a slot is "filled", or it is "empty". More advanced DMs also keep track of the '''degree of grounding''' - how sure are we, that we really understood what the user said: whether it was "Just recently introduced", "Introduced again", "acknowledged", "repeated", etc. We can also allow the author to specify, for each piece of information, the degree to which we NEED it to be understood, e.g. sensitive information need higher degree. The DM uses this information to control the course of dialog, e.g., if the human said something about a sensitive subject, and we are not sure we understood, then the DM will issue a confirmation question. See [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/11023993 Roque and Traum (2008)].

=== Information state ===

The [http://www.ling.gu.se/projekt/trindi/trindikit/ TrindiKit] DS, developed during the [http://www.ling.gu.se/projekt/trindi/ Trindi] project, allows authors to define a complex information state, and write general rules that process this state. Here is a sample rule:

integrateAnswer:
* preconditions: ("If the human gave a relevant answer to a question currently under discussion...")
** in(SHARED.LM, answer(usr, A))
** fst(SHARED.QUD, Q)
** relevant_answer(Q, A)
* effects: ("... then remove it from the Question Under Discussion, and add it to the shared ground")
** pop(SHARED.QUD)
** reduce(Q, A, P)
** add(SHARED.COM, P)

The DM decides, according to the input and the state, which rules are applicable, and applies them to get the new state.

This may help authors re-use general rules for dialog management rules, based on dialog theories. DSs developed with TrindiKit include: GoDiS, MIDAS, EDIS and SRI Autorate.

The information state approach was developed later in projects such as [http://www.ling.gu.se/projekt/siridus/ Siridus] and the [http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/dipper/ Dipper] toolkit.

Another example of an information state based dialogue manager is [http://nld.ict.usc.edu/group/publications/flores-forward-looking-reward-seeking-dialogue-manager FLoReS]. It uses a propositional information state to encode the current state and selects the next action using a [[Markov decision process]]. This dialogue manager is implemented in the [https://github.com/fmorbini/jmNL jmNL software].

=== General Planning ===
A generalization of this approach is to let the author define the '''goals''' of the agent, and let the DM construct a '''plan''' to achieve that goal. The plan is made of '''operations.''' Each speech act is an operation. Each operation has '''preconditions''' and '''postconditions''' (=effects), for example:

Inform(Speaker,Hearer,Predicate):
* Precondition: Knows(Speaker,Predicate) AND Wants(Speaker,Inform(Speaker,Hearer,Predicate))
* Effect: Knows(Hearer,Predicate)
* Body: Believes(Hearer,Wants(Speaker,Knows(Hearer,Predicate)))

The conversation can be navigated using a general planner, such as [[Strengths, Opportunities, Aspirations &amp; Results|SOAR]]. The planner maintains the current state, and tries to construct a plan to achieve the goal, using the given operations.

A similar approach is taken in [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/10242522 SASO-ST] (a DS for multi-agent negotiation training). Using SOAR allows the incorporation of complex emotional and social models, for example: the agent can decide, based on the human actions, whether he wants to cooperate with him, avoid him, or even attack him.

A similar approach is taken in [http://cs.rochester.edu/research/cisd/projects/trips/ TRIPS] (a DS for multi-agent collaborative problem solving). They split the dialog management into several modules: 
* '''Reference manager''' - Given a word (e.g. "the woman"), decide what object in the world it refers to (e.g. "WOM1234").
* '''Task manager''' - Identify the problem-solving acts that the user tries to achieve (create new objective, extend an existing objective, etc.).
* '''Interpretation manager''' - in addition to calling the first two, also identify discourse obligations, for example: "respond to the latest question".
* '''Behavioral agent''' - decides how to accomplish the goal that the user wants. The agent employs several task-specific agents that do the actual planning.

A different kind of planning is '''theorem proving'''. A dialog can be described as an attempt to prove a theorem. The system interacts with user to supply "missing axioms" to help complete the proof (this is called "backward chaining"). This approach was implemented by:
* Grammatical Framework, see [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/1177324 Ranta and Cooper (2004)].
* IPSIM (Interruptible Prolog SIMulator), in the Circuit Fixit system; see Smith, Hipp &amp; Biermann.

The dialog manager can be connected with an [[expert system]], to give the ability to respond with specific expertise.

== Tactic flow-control DM ==
In addition to following the general structure and goals of the dialog, some DMs also make some tactical conversational decisions - local decisions that affect the quality of conversation.

=== Error handling ===

The ASR and NLU modules are usually not 100% sure they understood the user; they usually return a confidence score reflecting the quality of understanding. In such cases, the DM should decide whether to:

* Just assume that the most probable interpretation is correct, and continue the conversation ('''no-confirmation''');
* Continue the conversation, but add some words that show understanding, such as "OK, you want to go to a restaurant. Where exactly?" ('''implicit-confirmation''').
* Ask the user what exactly he intended to say ('''explicit-confirmation'''): "Do you mean X?" "Did you say X or Y?", etc.
* Tell the user "I didn't understand, please say this again".

Choosing "no-confirmation" may make the dialog proceed quicker, but may also introduce mistakes which will take longer to correct later.

Error handling was researched extensively by [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dbohus/ravenclaw-olympus/research.html Ravenclaw], which allows the author to manually control the error handling strategy in each part of the dialog.

=== Initiative control ===

Some DSs have several modes of operation: the default mode is '''user-initiative''', where the system just asks "what can I do for you?" and lets the user navigate the conversation. This is good for experienced users. However, if there are many misunderstandings between the user and the system, the DM may decide to switch to '''mixed-initiative''' or '''system-initiative''' - ask the user explicit questions, and accept one answer at a time.

=== Pedagogical decisions ===

Tactical decisions of a different type are done by [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/10021462 Cordillera] (a tutorial DS for teaching physics, built using TuTalk). In many points during the lesson, the DM should decide:
* Whether to Tell the pupil some fact, or try to Elicit this fact from him by asking guiding questions.
* Whether to ask the pupil to Justify his answer, or just Skip the justification and continue.

These decisions affect the overall quality of learning, which can be measured by comparing pre- and post-learning exams.

=== Learned tactics ===
Instead of letting a human expert write a complex set of decision rules, it is more common to use [[reinforcement learning]]. The dialog is represented as a [[Markov Decision Process]] (MDP) - a process where, in each state, the DM has to select an action, based on the state and the possible rewards from each action. In this setting, the dialog author should only define the reward function, for example: in tutorial dialogs, the reward is the increase in the student grade; in information seeking dialogs, the reward is positive if the human receives the information, but there is also a negative reward for each dialog step.

RL techniques are then used to learn a policy, for example, what kind of confirmation should we use in each state? etc. This policy is later used by the DM in real dialogs.

A tutorial on this subject were written by [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/10776325 Lemon and Rieser (2009)].

A different way to learn dialog policies is to try to imitate humans, using Wizard of Oz experiments, in which a human sits in a hidden room and tells the computer what to say; see for example [http://www.citeulike.org/user/erelsegal-halevi/article/9998567 Passonneau et al (2011)].

==Technology==
Digital do MaiN's power amplifiers use V-FET technology transistors. Initially developed by [[Yamaha|Nippon Gakki Seizo K.K.]] in the 1970s (US Patent 4,216,038&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wikipatents.org/patent/US4216038A-semiconductor-device-and-manufacturing-process-thereof | author=[[Junichi Nishizawa|Nishizawa, Jun-ichi]] |author2=Mochida, Yasunori |author3=Nonaka, Terumoto |author4=Hotta, Tadahiko |author5= Yamashita, Shin  | title=US Patent 4,216,038 | work=[[Yamaha Corporation|Nippon Gakki Seizo Kabushiki Gaisha]] | publisher=Wikipatents | accessdate=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;), technology was improved, and 2SK77B transistor had been released.

A '''dystopia''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] δυσ- "bad" and τόπος "place"; alternatively, '''cacotopia''',&lt;ref name="Bentham"&gt;Cacotopia (from κακός ''kakos'' "bad") was the term used by [[Jeremy Bentham]] in his 19th century works ({{cite web|url=http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/articles/col-dystopia.htm|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326062103/http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/articles/col-dystopia.htm|archivedate=26 March 2006|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2006-03-19|df=}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3ye0vWc85eYC&amp;pg=PA230])&lt;/ref&gt; '''kakotopia''', or simply '''anti-utopia''') is a community or society that is undesirable or frightening.&lt;ref name=Merriam/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; It is translated as "not-good place" and is an [[antonym]] of [[utopia]], a term that was coined by [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]] and figures as the title of his best known work, ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', published 1516, a blueprint for an ideal society with minimal crime, violence and poverty.

Dystopian societies appear in many artistic works, particularly in stories [[setting (narrative)|set]] in the future. Some of the most famous examples are [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]''. Dystopias are often characterized by [[dehumanization]],&lt;ref name=Merriam&gt;{{cite web|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|title=Definition of "dystopia"|year=2012|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dystopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tyrant|tyrannical]] governments, [[environmental disaster]],&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Definition of "dystopia"|year=2012|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/dystopia?q=dystopia}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society. Dystopian societies appear in many sub-genres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to real-world issues regarding society, [[Environmental issues|environment]], [[politics]], [[economics]], [[religion]], [[psychology]], [[ethics]], [[science]], or [[technology]]. However, some authors also use the term to refer to actually-existing societies, many of which are or have been [[totalitarian]] states, or societies in an advanced state of collapse and disintegration.

It should be noted that some scholars, such as [[Gregory Claeys]] and [[Lyman Tower Sargent]], make certain distinctions between typical synonyms of dystopias. For example, Claeys and Sargent define literary dystopias as societies imagined as substantially worse than the contemporaneous society in which the author writes, whereas '''anti-utopias''' function as criticisms of attempts to implement various concepts of utopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=24EUCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Utopia Reader|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Though several earlier usages are known, ''dystopia'' was deployed as an antonym for ''[[Utopia]]'' by [[John Stuart Mill|J. S. Mill]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tisdall |first=Nigel |url=https://www.ft.com/content/2f94aa6a-a0f8-11e6-891e-abe238dee8e2 |title=Postcard from Belgium: the birthplace of utopia |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=4 November 2016 |accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in one of his Parliamentary Speeches 1868&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |date=1988 |title=Public and parliamentary speeches - Part I - November 1850 - November 1868 |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/262 |location=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=0-415-03791-3 |access-date=2015-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Hansard Commons'') by adding the prefix "dys" ({{lang-grc|δυσ-}} "bad"), reinterpreting the initial ''U'' as the prefix "eu" ({{lang-grc|ευ-}} "good") instead of "ou" ({{lang-grc|οὐ}} "not"). It was used to denounce the government's Irish land policy: "It is, perhaps, too complimentary to call them Utopians, they ought rather to be called dys-topians, or caco-topians. What is commonly called Utopian is something too good to be practicable; but what they appear to favour is too bad to be practicable."&lt;ref name="Hermansson"&gt;[[Cf.]] [http://hem.passagen.se/replikant/dystopia_timeline.htm "Dystopia Timeline"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503015002/http://hem.passagen.se/replikant/dystopia_timeline.htm|date=3 May 2006}}, in ''Exploring Dystopia'', "edited and designed by Niclas Hermansson; Contributors: Acolyte of Death ('Gattaca'), John Steinbach ('Nuclear Nightmare'), [and] David Clements ('From Dystopia to Myopia')" (''hem.passagen.se''), Niclas Hermansson, n.d., [[World Wide Web|Web]], 22 May 2009.&lt;!--This site appears to be a self-published website and its reliability may be dubious.

"An imaginary place or condition in which everything is as bad as possible; opp. UTOPIA (cf. CACOTOPIA). So dystopian n., one who advocates or describes a dystopia; dystopian a., of or pertaining to a dystopia; dystopianism, dystopian quality or characteristics."  The example of first usage given in the ''OED'' (1989 ed.) refers to the 1868 speech by John Stuart Mill quoted above. Other examples given in the ''OED'' include:

Decades before the first documented use of the word "dystopia" was "cacotopia" (using {{lang-grc|κακόs}}, "bad, wicked")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkako%2Fs κακόs], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; originally proposed in 1818 by [[Jeremy Bentham]]: "As a match for utopia (or the imagined seat of the best government) suppose a cacotopia (or the imagined seat of the worst government) discovered and described."&lt;ref name="bentham"&gt;Bentham, Jeremy. (1818). ''Plan of Parliamentary Reform, in the form of a catechism''.&lt;/ref&gt; Though dystopia became the most popular term, cacotopia finds occasional use, for example by [[Anthony Burgess]], author of ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', who said it was a better fit for Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' because "it sounds worse than dystopia".&lt;ref name="beaumont"&gt;Beaumont, Matthew. (2006). [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/elh/summary/v073/73.2beaumont.html Cacotopianism, the Paris Commune, and England's Anti-Communist Imaginary, 1870-1900]. ''ELH, 73''(2): 465-487.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Common theme==

===Politics===
In ''[[When the Sleeper Wakes]]'', [[H.&amp;nbsp;G.&amp;nbsp;Wells]] depicted the governing class as hedonistic and shallow.&lt;ref name=Steinhoff153&gt;William Steinhoff, "Utopia Reconsidered: Comments on ''1984''" 153, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Orwell]] contrasted Wells's world to that depicted in Jack London's ''[[The Iron Heel]]'', where the dystopian rulers are brutal and dedicated to the point of fanaticism, which Orwell considered more plausible.&lt;ref name=Steinhoff147&gt;William Steinhoff, "Utopia Reconsidered: Comments on ''1984''" 147, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''. {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the political principles at the root of fictional utopias (or "perfect worlds") are [[idealistic]] in principle and successfully result in positive consequences for the inhabitants,&lt;ref name="Utopia"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Utopia "Utopia"], ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', 4th ed., 2004, ''[[Dictionary.com]]'', [[World Wide Web|Web]], 11 Feb. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the political principles on which fictional dystopias are based, while often based on utopian ideals, result in negative consequences for inhabitants because of at least one [[fatal flaw]].&lt;ref name=Snodgrass&gt;[[Mary Ellen Snodgrass]], ''Encyclopedia of Utopian Literature'', ABC-Clio Literary Companion Ser. (Santa Barbara: ABC-Clio Inc., 1995) xii.  {{ISBN|0-87436-757-3}} (10).  {{ISBN|978-0-87436-757-7}} (13).&lt;!--not verified.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Dystopias are often filled with [[pessimism|pessimistic]] views of the ruling class or a government that is brutal or uncaring, ruling with an "iron hand" or "iron fist".{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Dystopian governments are sometimes ruled by a fascist regime or dictator. These dystopian government establishments often have protagonists or groups that lead a "[[Resistance movement|resistance]]" to enact change within their society, as is seen in [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[V for Vendetta]]''.&lt;ref name=Donawerth&gt;Jane Donawerth, "Genre Blending and the Critical Dystopia", in ''Dark Horizons: Science Fiction and the Dystopian Imagination'', ed. Raffaella Baccolini and Tom Moylan (New York: Routledge, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dystopian political situations are depicted in novels such as ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', ''[[Parable of the Sower (novel)|Parable of the Sower]]'', ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'', ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', ''[[Brave New World]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games]]'', ''[[Divergent (book)|Divergent]]'', and ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]''; and in such films as ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'', ''[[FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions]]'', ''[[Soylent Green]]'', and ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]''.

===Economics===
The economic structures of dystopian societies in literature and other media have many variations, as the economy often relates directly to the elements that the writer is depicting as the source of the oppression. However, there are several [[archetypes]] that such societies tend to follow.

A commonly occurring theme is the dichotomy of [[Planned economy|planned economies]] versus [[free market]] economies, a conflict which is found in such works as [[Ayn Rand]]'s ''Anthem'' and [[Henry Kuttner]]'s short story "The Iron Standard". Another example of this is reflected in [[Norman Jewison]]'s 1975 film ''[[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]]''.

Some dystopias, such as that of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', feature [[black market]]s with goods that are dangerous and difficult to obtain, or the characters may be totally at the mercy of the state-controlled economy. [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]'' depicts a dystopia in which the centrally controlled economic system has indeed made material abundance plentiful, but deprived the mass of humanity of meaningful labor; virtually all work is menial and unsatisfying, and only a small number of the small group that achieves education is admitted to the elite and its work.&lt;ref&gt;Howard P. Segal, "Vonnegut's ''Player Piano'': An Ambiguous Technological Dystopia," 163 in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Tanith Lee]]'s ''[[Don't Bite the Sun]]'', there is no want of any kind &amp;ndash; only unabashed consumption and hedonism, leading the protagonist to begin looking for a deeper meaning to existence.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Tanith. ''Don't Bite the Sun''. Bantam Books:1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in dystopias where the economic system is not the source of the society's flaws, as in ''Brave New World'', the state often controls the economy. In ''Brave New World'', a character, reacting with horror to the suggestion of not being part of the social body, cites as a reason that everyone works for everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;William Matter, "On Brave New World" 98, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works feature extensive [[privatization]] and [[corporatism]]; both byproducts of [[capitalism]], where privately owned and unaccountable large corporations have effectively replaced the government in setting policy and making decisions. They manipulate, infiltrate, control, bribe, are contracted by, or otherwise [[corporate republic|function as government]]. This is seen in the novels ''[[Jennifer Government]]'' and ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'' and the movies ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[RoboCop]]'', ''[[Visioneers]]'', ''[[Idiocracy]]'', ''Soylent Green'', ''[[THX 1138]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'' and ''[[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]]''. Corporate republics common in the [[cyberpunk]] genre, as in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Snow Crash]]'' and [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' (as well as the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', loosely based on Dick's novel).

====Social stratification====
Dystopian fiction frequently draws stark contrasts between the privileges of the ruling class and the dreary existence of the working classes.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In the novel ''Brave New World'', written in 1931 by [[Aldous Huxley]], a class system is prenatally designated in terms of Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons, with the lower classes having reduced brain-function and special conditioning to make them satisfied with their position in life.&lt;ref&gt;William Matter, "On ''Brave New World''" 95, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''. {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of this society there also exist several human settlements that still exist in the ''conventional'' way but which the class system describe as "savages".

In ''Ypsilon Minus'' by [[Herbert W. Franke]], people are divided into numerous alphabetically ranked groups.

===Family===
Some fictional dystopias, such as ''[[Brave New World]]'' and ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', have eradicated the family and deploy continuing efforts to keep it from re-establishing itself as a social institution. In ''Brave New World'', where children are reproduced artificially, the concepts "mother" and "father" are considered obscene.  In some novels, the State is hostile to motherhood: for example, in ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', children are organized to spy on their parents; and in ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], the escape of a pregnant woman from One State is a revolt.&lt;ref name=Beauchamp&gt;Gorman Beauchamp, "Zamiatin's ''We''" 70, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''. {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Religious groups play the role of the oppressed and oppressors. In ''Brave New World'', for example, the establishment of the state included lopping off the tops of all crosses (as symbols of Christianity) to make them "T"s, (as symbols of [[Ford Model T|Henry Ford's Model T]]).&lt;ref&gt;William Matter, "On ''Brave New World''" 94, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Atwood]]'s novel ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'', on the other hand, takes place in a future United States under a Christianity-based theocratic regime.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Atwood, ''The Handmaid's Tale'', McClelland and Stewart, 1985. {{ISBN|0-7710-0813-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest examples of this theme is [[Robert Hugh Benson]]'s ''[[Lord of the World]]'', about a futuristic world where the [[Freemasons]] have taken over the world and the only other religion left is a [[Roman Catholic]] minority.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Identity===
In the Russian novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], first published in 1921, people are permitted to live out of public view twice a week for one hour and are only referred to by numbers instead of names.

In some dystopian works, such as [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Harrison Bergeron]]'', society forces individuals to [[conformity|conform]] to radical [[egalitarian]] social norms that discourage or suppress accomplishment or even competence as forms of inequality.

===Violence===
[[Violence]] is prevalent in many dystopias, often in the form of [[war]] (e.g. ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''); urban crimes led by gangs (often of teenagers) (e.g. ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''); rampant crime met by [[blood sport]]s (e.g. ''[[Battle Royale (novel)|Battle Royale]]'', ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games]]'' and ''[[Divergent (novel)|Divergent]]''). Also explained in Suzanne Berne's essay "Ground Zero", where she explains her experience with the aftermath of 11 September 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berne|first1=Suzanne|title=Patterns for College Writing|journal=Ground Zero|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nature===
Fictional dystopias are commonly urban and frequently isolate their characters from all contact with the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;"Avatism and Utopia" 4, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.{{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they require their characters to avoid nature, as when walks are regarded as dangerously [[Anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] in Ray Bradbury's ''Fahrenheit 451'', as well as within Bradbury's short story "[[The Pedestrian]]."{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'', science coordinated by government is directed toward the control of nature and the elimination of natural human instincts.  In ''Brave New World'', the lower classes of society are conditioned to be afraid of nature, but also to visit the countryside and consume transportation and games to promote economic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|title=Brave New World}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lois Lowry's "[[The Giver]]", in a manner similar to Brave New World, shows a society where technology and the desire to create a utopia has led humanity to enforce climate control on the environment, as well as to eliminate many undomesticated species, and to provide psychological and pharmaceutical repellent against basic human instincts. [[E. M. Forster]]'s "[[The Machine Stops]]" depicts a highly changed global environment which forces people to live underground due to an atmospheric contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galdon Rodriguez|first=Angel|date=2014|title=Urban and Natural Spaces in Dystopian Literature Depicted as Opposed Scenarios|url=http://pendientedemigracion.ucm.es/info/angulo/volumen/Volumen06-2/articulos05.htm|journal=Ángulo Recto.

Excessive pollution that destroys nature is common in many dystopian films, such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[RoboCop]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'', and ''Soylent Green''.  A few "green" fictional dystopias do exist, such as in [[Michael Carson (author)|Michael Carson]]'s short story "[[The Punishment of Luxury]]", and [[Russell Hoban]]'s ''[[Riddley Walker]]''. The latter is set in the aftermath of nuclear war, "a post-nuclear holocaust Kent, where technology has reduced to the level of the [[Iron Age]]".&lt;ref&gt;

===Science and technology===
Contrary to the [[Technological utopianism|technologically utopian]] claims, which view technology as a beneficial addition to all aspects of humanity, technological dystopia concerns itself with and focuses largely (but not always) on the negative effects caused by new technology.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Rushkoff, D. (2002). Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative.Explorations in Media Ecology, 1(1), 21-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Typical dystopian claims====
1. ''Technologies reflect and encourage the worst aspects of human nature.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''
[[Jaron Lanier]], a digital pioneer, has become a technological dystopian. “I think it’s a way of interpreting technology in which people forgot taking responsibility,” he says.

“‘Oh, it’s the computer that did it, not me.’ ‘There’s no more middle class? Oh, it’s not me. The computer did it’” (Lanier). This quote explains that people begin to not only blame the technology for the changes in lifestyle but also believe that technology is an omnipotence. It also points to a technological determinist perspective in terms of reification.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, D. (2013, July 3). Technological or Media Determinism. Retrieved March 2, 2015, from http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/tecdet/tdet05.html&lt;/ref&gt;

2. ''Technologies harm our interpersonal communication, relationships, and communities.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Rosenbaum, R. (2013, January 1). What Turned Jaron Lanier Against the Web? Retrieved March 2, 2015, from http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/what-turned-jaron-lanier-against-the-web-165260940/?all&amp;no-ist&lt;/ref&gt;''
* decrease in communication within family members and friend groups due to increased time in technology use
* virtual space misleadingly heightens the impact of real presence; people resort to technological medium for communication nowadays

3. ''Technologies reinforce hierarchies - concentrate knowledge and skills; increase surveillance and erode privacy; widen inequalities of power and wealth; giving up control to machines). ''
[[Douglas Rushkoff]], a technological utopian, states in his article that the professional designers “re-mystified” the computer so it wasn’t so readable anymore; users had to depend on the special programs built into the software that was incomprehensible for normal users.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

4. ''New technologies are sometimes regressive (worse than previous technologies).&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''

5. ''The unforeseen impacts of technology are negative.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''
“ ‘The most common way is that there’s some magic artificial intelligence in the sky or in the cloud or something that knows how to translate, and what a wonderful thing that this is available for free. But there’s another way to look at it, which is the technically true way: You gather a ton of information from real live translators who have translated phrases… It’s huge but very much like Facebook, it’s selling people back to themselves… [With translation] you’re producing this result that looks magical but in the meantime, the original translators aren’t paid for their work… You’re actually shrinking the economy.’”&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

6. ''More efficiency and choices can harm our quality of life (by causing stress, destroying jobs, making us more materialistic).&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Heitman, B. (2011, April 13). The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood.(Books)(Book review). The Christian Science Monitor, 146-150.&lt;/ref&gt;''
In his article “Prest-o! Change-o!,” technological dystopian James Gleick mentions the remote control being the classic example of technology that does not solve the problem “it is meant to solve.” Gleick quotes Edward Tenner, a historian of technology, that the ability and ease of switching channels by the remote control serves to increase distraction for the viewer. Then it is only expected that people will become more dissatisfied with the channel they are watching.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

7. ''New technologies cannot solve problems of old technologies or just create new problems.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;''
The remote control example explains this claim as well, for the increase in laziness and dissatisfaction levels was clearly not a problem in times without the remote control. He also takes social psychologist Robert Levine’s example of Indonesians “‘whose main entertainment consists of watching the same few plays and dances, month after month, year after year,’ and with Nepalese Sherpas who eat the same meals of potatoes and tea through their entire lives. The Indonesians and Sherpas are perfectly satisfied.” Because of the invention of the remote control, it merely created more problems.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

8. ''Technologies destroy nature (harming human health and the environment). ''
The need for business replaced community and the “story online” replaced people as the “soul of the Net.” Because information was now able to be bought and sold, there was not as much communication taking place.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Dystopias typically reflect contemporary sociopolitical realities and extrapolate worst-case scenarios as warnings for necessary social change or caution.&lt;ref name=theguardian1&gt;{{cite web|title=Dystopian stories used to reflect our anxieties. Now they reflect our reality|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/26/dystopian-stories-margaret-atwood-walking-dead-zombies|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=3 March 2017|date=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dystopian fictions invariably reflect the concerns and fears of its contemporaneous culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dystopia facts, information, pictures|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/literature-and-arts/literature-english/english-literature-20th-cent-present/dystopia|website=www.encyclopedia.com|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this they are a subject of [[social studies]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Syreeta McFadden notes that contemporary dystopian literature and films increasingly pull their inspiration from the worst imaginings of ourselves and present reality, making it often hard to distinguish between entertainment and reality.&lt;ref name=theguardian1/&gt;

Christopher Schmidt notes that while the world goes to waste for future generations we distract ourselves from disaster by passively watching it as entertainment.&lt;ref name=jstor1/&gt;

You grow up in a world where it's part of the conversation all the time – the statistics of [[global warming|our planet warming up]]. The environment is changing. The weather is different. There are things that are very visceral and very obvious, and they make you question the future and how we will survive. It's so much a part of everyday life that young people inevitably — consciously or not — are questioning their futures and how the Earth will be. I certainly do. I wonder what kind of world my children's kids will live in."&lt;ref name=time1/&gt;

'''Effective safety training''' is an unofficial phrase used to describe the training materials designed to teach [[occupational safety and health]] standards developed by the United States government labor organization, [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA). OSHA has produced many standards and regulations that affect employers and employees in the United States.  United States employers have a legal responsibility to educate employees on all [[Occupational safety and health|workplace safety]] standards and the hazards that their employees may face while on the job, and providing effective safety training meets that responsibility.

==Introduction==

Employers must have an overall safety program including relative site specific safety information where applicable.   The safety training program should cover topics such as:&lt;ref name="Barnett"&gt;Lawrence(J.D.), Barnett (2000). ''Safety Management Handbook: CCH Safety Professional Series''. Vol. 2 pg.9301–9307. Health and Human Resources, Chicago, IL&lt;/ref&gt;
*accident prevention and safety promotion
*safety compliance
*accident and emergency response
*personal protective equipment
*safety practices
*equipment and machinery
*chemical and hazardous materials safety
*workplace hazards
*employee involvement

Employers must document all training.  Creating a training matrix will help keep track of who has been trained, when they were trained, the training topic, and when it is time for refresher training. Employees must also sign an official sign-in sheet provided by the employer that can serve as proof that employees received proper training.  The sign in sheet must have a broad description of what is being covered in the training. Tests or quizzes on the presented material can help gauge employee understanding of the material and highlight topics that need to be reviewed.

The non-English speaking population is consistently growing in many industries and it is important that employers provide bilingual training for those workers, as OSHA requires that '''all employees''' be properly trained.

Most employees display attitudes of disinterest and dread at the thought of attending a safety training, which can leave the trainer feeling frustrated and unappreciated.  It is the trainer's duty to make safety training fun and educational, which will help the trainees to retain the information, enjoy the course, and apply the learning to their work and lives.&lt;ref&gt;Hilyer, Barbara; Veasey, Alan; Oldfield, Kenneth; Craft-McCormick, Lisa (2000) ''Effective Safety and Health Training'', CRC Press {{ISBN|1-56670-396-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of a training program==

An effective training program can reduce the number of injuries and [[occupational fatality|deaths]], property damage, legal liability, illnesses, workers' compensation claims, and missed time from work.  An effective safety training program can also help a trainer keep the required OSHA-mandated safety training courses organized and up-to-date.
Safety training classes help establish a safety culture in which employees themselves help promote proper safety procedures while on the job. It is important that new employees be properly trained and embrace the importance of workplace safety as it is easy for seasoned workers to negatively influence the new hires. That negative influence however, can be purged with the establishment of new, hands-on, innovative effective safety training which will ultimately lead to an effective safety culture. A 1998 [[NIOSH]] study concluded that the role of training in developing and maintaining effective hazard control activities is a proven and successful method of intervention.&lt;ref&gt;NIOSH (1998). ''Assessing Occupational Safety and Health Training: a Literature Review'', NIOSH Publication No. 98-145&lt;/ref&gt;

==OSHA's voluntary training guidelines==

OSHA issued voluntary training guidelines in 1992.  These guidelines serve as a model for trainers to use in developing, organizing, evaluating, and editing their safety training programs.  It is important for trainers to tailor the OSHA guidelines to their specific work site so that the training is relevant to the specific working conditions and not just a long generalized informational session.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many standards promulgated by OSHA explicitly require the employer to train employees in the safety and health aspects of their jobs. Other OSHA standards make it the employer's responsibility to limit certain job assignments to employees who are "certified," "competent," or "qualified"—meaning that they have had special previous training, in or out of the workplace. The term "designated" personnel means selected or assigned by the employer or the employer's representative as being qualified to perform specific duties. These requirements reflect OSHA's belief that training is an essential part of every employer's safety and health program for protecting workers from injuries and illnesses.&lt;ref name="OSHA"&gt;US Department of Labor. ''Training Requirements in OSHA Standards and Training Guidelines''. OSHA 2254 1998 (Revised). https://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha2254.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

OSHA's training guidelines follow a model that consists of:

*A. Determining if Training is Needed
*B. Identifying Training Needs
*C. Identifying Goals and Objectives
*D. Developing learning activities
*E. Conducting the training
*F. Evaluating program effectiveness
*G. Improving the program
*H. Training must align with job tasks.
**'''A. Determining if training is needed'''
You first have to determine if a situation can be solved using training. Training, or retraining as the case may be, could be required by an OSHA standard.  Training is an effective solution to problems such as employee lack of understanding, unfamiliarity with equipment, incorrect execution of a task, lack of attention, or lack of motivation.  Sometimes, however, the situation cannot be mitigated through the use of training and other methods, such as the establishment of engineering controls, may be needed to ensure worker safety.

**'''B. Identifying training needs'''
A [[job safety analysis]] and/or a [[job hazard analysis]] should be conducted with every employee so that it is understood what is needed to do the job safely and what hazards are associated with the job.  A safety trainer may observe the worker in his/her environment to adequately assess the worker's training needs.  Certain employees may need extra training due to the hazards associated with their particular job.  These employees should be trained not only on
how to perform their job safely but also on how to operate within a hazardous
environment.

**'''C. Identifying Goals and Objectives'''
It is important for the Trainer to identify necessary training material.  It is equally important that the trainer identify training material that is not needed to avoid unnecessary training and frustration from their trainees.

At the beginning of every safety training session the trainer should clearly iterate the objectives of the class.  The objectives should be delivered using action oriented words like:  the employee ..."will be able to demonstrate" or "will know when to"... which will help the audience understand what he/she should know by the end of the class or what to information to assimilate during the class. Clearly established objectives also help focus the evaluation process on those skill sets and knowledge requirements necessary to perform the job safely.

**'''D. Developing Learning Activities'''
Training should be hands-on and simulate the job as closely as possible.  Trainers can use instructional aids such as charts, manuals, PowerPoint presentations, and films.  Trainers can also include role-playing, live demonstrations, and round-table group discussions to stimulate employee participation. Games like "what's wrong with this picture" (it is usually good to use pictures of situations found at their specific location)" or "safety jeopardy" can be useful ways to make the training fun yet educational.

**'''E. Conducting the Training'''
Trainers should provide employees with an overview of the material to be learned and relate the training to the employees' experiences.  Employers should also reinforce what the employees have learned by summarizing the program's objectives and key points of training.  At the beginning of the training program, the trainer should show the employees why the material is important and relevant to their jobs.  Employees are more likely to pay attention and apply what they've learned if they know the benefits of the training.&lt;ref name="Barnett"/&gt;

**'''F. Evaluating Program Effectiveness'''
Evaluation will help employers or supervisors determine the amount of learning achieved and whether an employee's performance has improved on the job. Among the methods of evaluating training are:&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt; 
***(1) Student opinion. Questionnaires or informal discussions with employees can help employers determine the relevance and appropriateness of the training program
***(2) Supervisors' observations.  Supervisors are in good positions to observe an employee's performance both before and after the training and note improvements or changes
***(3) Workplace improvements. The ultimate success of a training program may be changes throughout the workplace that result in reduced injury or accident rates
*** (4) Formal assessments.  Practical and written exams also assist in evaluating understanding of training material.  For example, for a lift-truck operator, a written and a practical exam would identify areas of training that may need to be revisited.  Furthermore administering a pre-test and post-test will establish a knowledge base line or reference point to measure training effectiveness.
**'''G. Improving the Program'''
As evaluations are reviewed, it may be evident the training was not adequate and that the employees did not reach the expected level of knowledge and skill.  As the program is evaluated, the trainer should ask:&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt; 
***(1) If a job analysis was conducted, was it accurate?
***(2) Was any critical feature of the job overlooked?
***(3) Were the important gaps in knowledge and skill included?
***(4) Was material already known by the employees intentionally omitted?
***(5) Were the instructional objectives presented clearly and concretely?
***(6) Did the objectives state the level of acceptable performance that was expected of employees?
***(7) Did the learning activity simulate the actual job?
***(8) Was the learning activity appropriate for the kinds of knowledge and skills required on the job?
***(9) When the training was presented, was the organization of the material and its meaning made clear?
***(10) Were the employees motivated to learn?
***(11) Were the employees allowed to participate actively in the training process?
***(12) Was the employer's evaluation of the program thorough?

==Computer and video training==

Computers and videos can be a great addition to a company's safety training program. As stand alone resources, they may not be adequate in meeting OSHA's training requirements as they are not site specific. Computer-based training can help meet the following training challenges&lt;ref&gt;Hubiak, Stacy (1998). "Click On to Effective Training," ''Safety and Health Magazine'', Sept., pg.116&lt;/ref&gt;
*Training employees in remote sites
*Employees who become bored with the same safety training
*Safety managers lack of time and resources to effectively train employees
*Providing a means of documenting and tracking student progress
*Lowering trainer fees or travel costs
*A self-paced, relaxed learning environment

==OSHA Medical Safety==

There is no more important places to regard the positive impact the OSHA regulations than in the healthcare and clinical settings. OSHA has been revolutionary in the medical field due to its ability to prevent the spread of diseases. Every clinical facility on US land, civilian or military is governed by OSHA's directives. To remain in accordance to the Federal regulations enacted by OSHA healthcare administrators must maintain an OSHA safety program and train their employees on an annual basis. Some of the topics that employees must be trained on include:
* Bloodborne Pathogen Standard
* Chemical Hazard Communications
* Tuberculosis Exposure Control
* Mercury Exposure
* Ionizing Radiation Exposure
* Fire Escape Plan
* Emergency Action Plan
* Electricity Safety
* Fire Safety Standard

'''''Enchanted Feminism: The Reclaiming Witches of San Francisco''''' is an anthropological study of the [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Wiccan]] community of [[San Francisco]]. It was written by the Scandinavian theologian [[Jone Salomonsen]] of the [[California State University, Northridge]] and first published in 2002 by the [[Routledge]].

==Background==

===Paganism and Wicca in the United States===
Contemporary Paganism, which is also referred to as Neo-Paganism, is an [[umbrella term]] used to identify a wide variety of [[new religious movement|modern religious movements]], particularly those influenced by or claiming to be derived from the various [[Paganism|pagan]] beliefs of pre-modern Europe.&lt;ref name="Carpenter 1996 40"&gt;[[#Car96|Carpenter 1996]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lew04|Lewis 2004]]. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The religion of Pagan Witchcraft, or [[Wicca]], was developed in England during the first half of the 20th century and is one of several Pagan religions. The figure at the forefront of Wicca's early development was the English occultist [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] (1884&amp;ndash;1964), the author of ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959) and the founder of a tradition known as [[Gardnerian Wicca]]. Gardnerian Wicca revolved around the veneration of both a [[Horned God]] and a [[Mother Goddess]], the celebration of eight seasonally-based festivals in a [[Wheel of the Year]] and the practice of magical rituals in groups known as [[coven]]s. Gardnerianism was subsequently brought to the U.S. in the early 1960s by an English initiate, [[Raymond Buckland]] (1934&amp;ndash;), and his then-wife Rosemary, who together founded a coven in [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]] pp. 205&amp;ndash;252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 24&amp;ndash;25&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., new variants of Wicca developed, including [[Dianic Wicca]], a tradition founded in the 1970s which was influenced by [[second wave feminism]], emphasized female-only covens, and rejected the veneration of the Horned God. One initiate of both the Dianic and Gardnerian traditions was a woman known as [[Starhawk]] (1951&amp;ndash;) who went on to found her own tradition, [[Reclaiming (Neopaganism)|Reclaiming Wicca]], as well as publishing ''[[The Spiral Dance|The Spiral Dance: a Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess]]'' (1979), a book which helped spread Wicca throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. pp. 340&amp;ndash;351&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cli06|Clifton 2006]]. pp. 122&amp;ndash;123&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Magiocco's work, three American researchers working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these had been the practicing Wiccan, journalist and political activist [[Margot Adler]] in her ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]'', which was first published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl79|Adler 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt; A second study was produced by the anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] in her ''Persuasions of the Witches' Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England'' (1989), in which she focused on both a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders that were then operating in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luh89|Luhrmann 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the sociologist Loretta Orion's ''Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited'' (1995), which focused on Pagan communities on the American East Coast and Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ori95|Orion 1995]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berlin- Light control room at the main hall in the Konzerthaus - 4195.jpg|thumbnail|Light control room]]
In the performing arts, '''front of house''' (FOH) is the part of a performance venue that is open to the public. In [[theater (structure)|theatres]] and live [[music venue]]s, it consists of the [[auditorium]] and [[foyer]]s, as opposed to the [[stage (theatre)|stage]] and [[parts of a theatre#Backstage of offstage|backstage]] areas. In a theatre, the front of house manager is responsible for ticket sales, refreshments, and making sure the auditorium is set out properly.

== Live venues ==
[[Audio engineering|Sound]] operators, excluding the monitor engineers, are normally positioned in a small sectioned-off area front-of-house, surrounded by the audience or at the edge of the audience area. From this position they have unobstructed listening and a clear view of the performance, enabling the operation of the main speaker system, [[show control]] consoles and other equipment. In this case "front of house" can refer to both the general audience/public area or to the specific small section from where the show is mixed.

The front of house speakers are the main speakers that cover the audience, and the front of house desk is the desk that generates the front of house audio mix. In smaller venues the front of house desk may also produce [[foldback (sound engineering)|foldback]] (monitor) mixes for the monitor speakers onstage, whereas in larger venues there will normally be a second mixing desk for monitor control positioned just off the side of the main stage. The audio engineer that designs the front of house sound system and puts it into place for the show/event is the system engineer, and this role is often separate from the person who operates the mixing desk who is often employed by the band directly on larger tours or employed by the venue for smaller tours. The touring engineer is usually assisted by a house sound engineer (employed by the venue) who will be familiar with the installed system of the venue.

In stage lighting, any lighting fixtures that are on the audience side of the [[proscenium arch]] are referred to as being FOH. The lighting operator may also be located in the audience area as well, but are often in a [[lighting booth]].

This term can also refer to the individuals whose primary work is dealing with patrons, including [[House management|house managers]], ticket vendors, bartenders, merchandise vendors, [[Usher (occupation)|usher]]s, and [[museum attendant]]s.

{{Linguistics}}
In [[linguistics]], '''Functional Sentence Perspective''' (FSP) is a theory describing the information structure of the sentence and language communication in general. It has been developed in the tradition of the [[Prague school (linguistics)|Prague School]] of Functional and Structural Linguistics together with its sister theory, Topic-Focus Articulation.

The key concepts of FSP were laid down by [[Jan Firbas]] in the mid-1950s on the basis of the linguistic work of [[Vilém Mathesius]], especially his idea of functional syntax in linguistic characterology of language.

==Terminology==
The term '''Functional Sentence Perspective''' was created by Jan Firbas as a more convenient English equivalent of Mathesius’ Czech term [[:cz:aktuální členění větné|aktuální členění větné]]:

{{quote|“It is not without interest to note that Mathesius, who knew [[Henri Weil|Weil]]’s work, coined the felicitous term ‘aktuální členění větné. … As English ‘actual’ is not an exact equivalent of Czech ‘aktuální’, another term had to be found for English. I accepted Professor [[Josef Vachek]]’s suggestion and started using the term ‘functional sentence perspective’ (FSP; Firbas 1957). The term is based on Mathesius’ term ‘Satzperspektive’. Vachek’s suggestion has added the qualification ‘functional’. This is the way the term ‘functional sentence perspective’ (FSP) has found its way into the literature.”|Firbas, 1994, p. 4}}

Within Czech linguistics the Czech calque of the English term Functional Sentence Perspective '''funkční větná perspektiva''' is nowadays used to refer to the approach stemming from the writings of Jan Firbas and his followers, while the original Mathesius’ Czech term '''aktuální členění větné''' tends to be associated with the group of linguists developing the Topic-Focus Articulation, i.e. [[Petr Sgall]], [[Eva Hajičová]], [[Jarmila Panevová]] and their disciples, despite the fact that both terms are still sometimes used interchangeably in some Czech contributions to the topic of information structure of language.

'''Gambuh''' is an ancient form of [[Bali]]nese dance-drama. It is accompanied by musicians in a [[gamelan]] gambuh ensemble.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/gambuh |title=Gambuh |author=Oxford Encyclopedia of Theatre and Performance |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |accessdate=2011-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Gambuh is one of the oldest surviving forms in Balinese performing arts,&lt;ref name="Bandem"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=834127 |title=Gambuh: A Classical Balinese Dance-Drama in ''Asian Music''|author=I Made Bandem and Fredrik deBoer |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1978 |volume=10 |pages=115–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tenzer"/&gt; dating to the [[Majapahit#Decline|late Majapahit]] era (ca. 15th century) with very little known change since this time.&lt;ref name="Bandem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Susilo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/cseas/pubs/explore/v1n2-art5.html |title=Gambuh: A Dance-Drama of the Balinese Courts in Explorations in ''Southeast Asian Studies: A Journal of the Southeast Asian Studies Student Association'', Vol 1, No. 2, Fall 1997 |author=Emiko Susilo |publisher=University of Hawai'i Southeast Asian Studies Student Association |year=1997 |accessdate=2011-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604033810/http://www.hawaii.edu/cseas/pubs/explore/v1n2-art5.html |archivedate=2010-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Emiko Susilo writes, "when the dance-dramas of Majapahit came to Bali, they had the new task of ''preserving'' the tradition of a fallen dynasty"&lt;ref name="Susilo"/&gt;  (emphasis in original).  It also introduced a new element of narrative to Balinese performing arts that influenced other forms of dance-drama on the island, such as [[topeng]] masked dance and [[arja]] opera.&lt;ref name="Susilo"/&gt;  For centuries it was supported by patronage at the royal courts of Bali's aristocracy, during which it achieved its greatest heights of sophistication.  As the courts fell apart in the bloody [[History of Bali#Dutch seizure of Bali island|wars with the Dutch]], this support evaporated and much of the art of gambuh was lost.  Like the many other arts that formerly depended on royal patronage, gambuh found some community support by playing for temple ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

Gambuh is now nearly extinct.  In 1997, Susilo observed, "In total there are perhaps only four groups that perform in the Gambuh style."&lt;ref name="Susilo"/&gt;  It is unpopular even among Balinese performers.  The dance and music are technically exacting and complex; the dialogue requires knowledge of the [[Kawi language]].  Performances are long and, unlike [[wayang]] shows, contain no comic relief, making demands of potential audiences.&lt;ref name="Susilo"/&gt;

==Dramatic components==
Combining dance, music, and acting, gambuh draws on the narrative material of the Malat, a series of poems about the fictional Javanese Prince, [[Raden Panji]], an incarnation of [[Wisnu]].  On his wedding night, he is separated from his fiancée, [[Candra Kirana]], beginning an epic in which the two lovers search for each other over years and across wide areas of medieval Java.  They finally meet on the field of battle, recognize each other through their disguises, and live happily ever after.&lt;ref name="Susilo"/&gt;  Other characters include members of the court and their servants.  The refined (alus) characters speak in [[Kawi language|Kawi]], an old literary tongue, which is translated for the audience into contemporary [[Balinese language]] by the characters of lower status.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

==Gamelan Gambuh==
A complete gamelan gambuh requires approximately 17 musicians to accompany the dance-drama.  The main instruments in gambuh performances are very low bamboo flutes called [[suling]] gambuh, between 75 and 100&amp;nbsp;cm in length and 4 and 5&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.  There are usually four such flutes, but sometimes as few as two or as many as six.&lt;ref name="Rembang"&gt;{{cite book |title=Music Gambuh Batuan dan Pedungan |authors=I Nyoman Rembang, I Wayan Sudiana, Tilman Seebass, Wayne Vitale (editor)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The suling gambuh play melodies along with a [[rebab]] while percussion instruments fill out the sound with a variety of timbres and rhythms: a medium-sized [[gong]], a small gong called [[kajar (instrument)|kajar]], two [[kendang]], a chime called [[klenang]], a bell tree called [[gentorag]], [[rincik]] (reminiscent of a [[Gamelan gong kebyar#Ceng-Ceng|cengceng]]), a metallophone called [[kenyir]], [[kangsi (music)|kangsi]], and [[gumanak]].&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tenzer"&gt;{{cite book |isbn=0-945971-30-3 |title=Balinese Gamelan |author=Tenzer, Michael |publisher=Periplus Editions |year=1991}} Page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  The last three of those instruments—the kenyir, kangsi, and gumanak—are not currently found in any other gamelan ensemble of Bali.&lt;ref name="Rembang"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4179">'''Geomessaging''' is a technology that allows a person or system to send a message based on any media to a device that enters or exits one or more regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/ITST.2012.6425228|title=2012 12th International Conference on ITS Telecommunications|pages=497–501|year=2012|last1=Fujioka|first1=Masanobu|last2=Takahashi|first2=Masanori|last3=Matsumura|first3=Takeshi|last4=Chunmeng Wang|last5=Hirakoba|first5=Hiroyuki|isbn=978-1-4673-3070-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those regions can be created by using [[Geo-fence|geofences]], based on Latitude and Longitude, or adding beacons to the system associating those beacons with named locations. The device  will receive the message according to the rules defined by the campaign administrator (the person or system in charge of defining those locations and messages).

Rules can be: The minimum time to wait before resending a message, weekday, time range, etc.

The content of the message associated to those rules can be any images, text, html, metadata key-value pair, etc.

Increasingly geomessaging is finding its use in various applications including crisis communication and geo-location sensitive communication management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ugoround.com/white_papers/UgoRound-White-Paper-events-venue.pdf |title=Location Based Messaging for Events and Venue Crisis and Incident Management |publisher=UgoRound.com |date=21 July 2017 |accessdate=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geomessage Media==
Geomessage Media defines a [[Media (communication)|media]] genre where information or messages can be sent to recipients based on their location. Platforms that enable geo-notifications to a defined [[geo-fence]] would fall into the category of Geomessage Media. A geo-fence is a virtual radius or polygon defined by longitude and latitude coordinates on a map. Geofences are being used for a vast array of applications and services like reminder applications based on area, location sharing and localized advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Loyola L, Wong F, Pereira D ''et al.''|title=Proceedings of the Second ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Mobile Geographic Information Systems - MobiGIS '13|pages=51–58|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2534193|publisher=MobiGIS13| date=5 November 2016|accessdate=25 November 2016|doi=10.1145/2534190.2534193|isbn=9781450325318|chapter=Extending battery lifetime of mobile devices with geofence capabilities on dynamic-speed urban environments}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geomessage Media is a natural progression of information sent on Mass Media and Social Media. Geomessage Media platforms allow communicating or sending a geomessage to a hyper-local area. This allows for much more relevant, geo-contextual information to be sent. In some use cases the platforms allow messaging to an anonymised group, in a defined geolocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.shephertz.com/2016/05/05/geo-fencing-push-notifications-next-step-user-engagement |title=Geo-fencing in Push Notifications: The Next Step in User Engagement |publisher=ShepHertz |date=5 May 2016 |accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other use cases include sending messages to a geolocation where members of a known group may enter. 

Circumstances where a Geomessage would benefit recipients are many, for example:
* Evacuations – instructions can be given to a localised area or areas to evacuate
* Transport Management - Commuters can be sent advice and information that may delay their commute
* Weather – recipients in the path of a weather event can be notified
* Place of Interest – people entering, exiting or even dwelling in a place could be sent a message.

'''Green Star''' is a voluntary sustainability rating system for buildings in [[Australia]]. It was launched in 2003 by the [[Green Building Council of Australia]]. 

The Green Star rating system assesses the sustainability of projects at all stages of the built environment life cycle.  Ratings can be achieved at the planning phase for communities, during the design, construction or fit out phase of buildings, or during the ongoing operational phase.

The system considers assesses and rates buildings, fitouts and communities against a range of environmental impact categories, and aims to encourage leadership in environmentally sustainable design and construction, showcase innovation in sustainable building practices, and consider occupant health, productivity and operational cost savings.

In 2013, the GBCA released a report, ''The Value of Green Star'', which analysed data from 428 Green Star-certified projects occupying 5,746,000 million square metres across Australia and compared it to the ‘average’ Australian building and minimum practice benchmarks.  The research found that, on average, Green Star-certified buildings produce 62% fewer greenhouse gas emissions and use 66% less electricity than average Australian buildings.  Green Star buildings use 51% less potable water than average buildings. Green Star-certified buildings also have been found to recycle 96 per cent of their construction and demolition waste, compared to the average 58% for new construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbca.org.au/resources/gbca-publications/the-value-of-green-star/34754.htm Green Building Council of Australia: ''The Value of Green Star'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rating system==
Green Star benchmarks projects against the nine Green Star categories of: Management; Indoor Environment Quality; Energy; Transport; Water; Materials; Land Use &amp; Ecology; Emissions and Innovation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbca.org.au/green-star/green-star-overview/ Green Building Council of Australia: 'Green Star overview']&lt;/ref&gt; 

Within each category are credits which address specific aspects of sustainable building design, construction or performance. Ratings for buildings are available at the design stage ('Design' ratings), at the post-construction phase (known as 'As Built' ratings) or for interior fitouts (‘Interiors’ ratings).

Green Star - Communities rates projects at the community or precinct scale against the categories of: Liveability; Economic Prosperity; Environment; Design; Governance and Innovation.

Green Star certification is a formal process in which an independent assessment panel reviews documentary evidence that a project meets Green Star benchmarks within each credit. The assessment panel awards points, with a Green Star rating determined by comparing the overall score with the rating scale:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Score
! Rating
! Category
|-
| 10-19
| One Star
| Minimum Practice
|-
| 20-29
| Two Star
| Average Practice
|-
| 30-44
| Three Star
| Good Practice
|-
| 45-59
| Four Star
| Best Practice
|-
| 60-56

| Five Star
| Australian Excellence
|-
| 75+
| Six Star
| World Leadership
|}

Green Star rating tools for building, fitout and community design and construction reward projects that achieve best practice or above, which means ratings of 1, 2 or 3 are not awarded. Ongoing performance of a building can be rated at any of the 6 star ratings.

Buildings assessed using the Green Star – Performance rating tool will be able to achieve a Green Star rating from 1 – 6 Star Green Star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gbca.org.au/green-star/green-star-overview/the-green-star-rating-scale/ | title = The Green Star Rating Scale | publisher = Green Building Council Australia | accessdate = 1 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=factsheet&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gbcaus.org/docs/GBCA_OfficeExBuildingSHEET.pdf | title = Rating Tool Fact Sheet | publisher = Green Building Council of Australia | accessdate = 1 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==
More than 1900 projects around Australia have achieved Green Star ratings.  The first building to achieve a Green Star rating was 8 Brindabella Circuit at [[Canberra Airport]], which achieved a 5 Star Green Star – Office Design v1 rating in 2004.  In 2005, [[Council House 2]] in Melbourne became the first building to achieve a 6 Star Green Star – Office Design v1 rating.  [[Flinders Medical Centre]] – New South Wing was the first healthcare facility in Australia to achieve a Green Star rating.  [[Bond University]] Mirvac School for Sustainability achieved the first Green Star rating for an educational facility.  Other well-known Green Star projects include [[1 Bligh Street]] in Sydney and the [[Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre]].

== Controversy ==
The launch of the Green Star rating system was met with some scepticism by green groups, which argued that the rating system was funded by mostly development industry companies.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-106048784.html Article summarising the launch of Green Star after Australian Financial Review]&lt;/ref&gt;  There was controversy over a proposal to expand the forest certification of timber and composite timber products, but this issue was resolved with the release of the revised ‘Timber’ credit in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/business/green-star-rating-to-focus-on-legal-timber-20091220-l7in.html Sydney Morning Herald: Green Star rating to focus on legal timber]&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been concern over various aspects of the timeframe for awarding of the certification, transfer of properties once awarded, and termination rights.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.mondaq.com/article.asp?articleid=59652 Article looking at the application process on Mondaq.com ]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35648">The '''history of calendars''', means that people creating and using methods for keeping track of days and larger divisions of time, covers a practice with ancient roots.

Archeologists have reconstructed methods of [[timekeeping]] that go back to prehistoric times at least as old as the [[Neolithic]]. The natural units for timekeeping used by most historical societies are the [[day]], the [[solar year]] and the [[lunation]].
[[Calendar]]s are explicit schemes used for timekeeping. The first historically attested and formulized calendars date to the [[Bronze Age]], dependent on the development of [[Bronze Age writing|writing]] in the [[Ancient Near East]]. The [[Sumerian calendar]] was the earliest, followed by the [[Egyptian calendar|Egyptian]], [[Assyrian calendar|Assyrian]] and [[Elamite]] calendars.

A larger number of calendar systems of the ancient Near East appear in the [[Iron Age]] archaeological record, based on the Assyrian and [[Babylonian calendar]]s. This includes the calendar of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], which in turn gave rise to the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] as well as the [[Hebrew calendar]].

Calendars in antiquity were usually [[lunisolar]], depending on the introduction of [[intercalary month]]s to align the solar and the lunar years. This was mostly based on observation, but there may have been early attempts to model the pattern of intercalation algorithmically, as evidenced in the fragmentary 2nd-century [[Coligny calendar]]. Nevertheless, the Roman calendar contained very ancient remnants of a pre-Etruscan 10-month solar year.&lt;ref&gt;"Religion in the Etruscan period" in [http://global.britannica.com/topic/Roman-religion Roman religion] in Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman calendar was reformed by [[Julius Caesar]] in 45 BCE. The [[Julian calendar]] was no longer dependent on the observation of the new moon but simply followed an algorithm of introducing a leap day every four years.
This created a dissociation of the calendar [[month]] from the [[lunation]].

In the 11th century in [[Iran|Persia]], a calendar reform led by [[Omar Khayyam|Khayyam]] was announced in 1079, when the length of the year was measured as 365.24219858156 days.&lt;ref name="Khayyam biography"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Khayyam.html|title=Khayyam biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that the length of the year is changing in the sixth decimal place over a person's lifetime, this is outstandingly accurate. For comparison the length of the year at the end of the 19th century was 365.242196 days, while today it is 365.242190 days.&lt;ref name="Khayyam biography"/&gt;

The [[Gregorian calendar]] was introduced as a refinement of the Julian calendar in 1582, and is today in worldwide use as the ''de facto'' calendar for secular purposes.

==Etymology==
The term ''calendar'' itself is taken from the ''[[calends]]'', the term for the first day of the month in the [[Roman calendar]], related to the verb ''calare'' "to call out", referring to the calling or the announcement that the new moon was just seen. Latin ''calendarium'' meant "account book, register", as accounts were settled and debts were collected on the calends of each month.

The Latin term was adopted in [[Old French]] as ''calendier'' and from there in [[Middle English]] as ''calender'' by the 13th century. The spelling ''calendar'' is from [[Early Modern English]].

An alternative hypothesis connects "calendar" with [[Koledari]] in Slavic, pre-Christian tradition, which was later incorporated into Christmas. ''Kolo'' means "circle, cycle" and ''dar'' means "a gift".
[[File:Equinozio da Pizzo Vento,tramonto fondachelli fantina, sicilia.JPG|thumb|equinox seen from the astronomic calendar of Pizzo Vento at [[Fondachelli-Fantina|Fondachelli Fantina]], [[Sicily]]]]

==Prehistory==
A number of prehistoric structures have been proposed as having had the purpose of timekeeping (typically keeping track of the course of the [[solar year]]).
This includes many [[megalithic]] structures, and reconstructed arrangements going back far into the [[Neolithic]] period.

A ceramic artefact from Bulgaria, known as the [[Slatino furnace model]], has been pronounced by local archeologists and media to be the oldest known calendar representation, a claim not endorsed in mainstream views.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey D., 2000, Balkan Prehistory: Exclusion, Incorporation and Identity, London:Routledge p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[mesolithic]] arrangement of twelve pits and an arc found in [[Warren Field]], [[Aberdeenshire]], Scotland, dated to roughly 10,000 years ago, has been described as a [[lunar calendar]] and was dubbed the "world's oldest known calendar" in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2013-07-scotland-lunar-calendar-stone-age-rethink.html]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809125949/http://phys.org/news/2013-07-scotland-lunar-calendar-stone-age-rethink.html|date=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Near East==

The ancient [[Sumer]]ian calendar divided a year into 12 [[lunar month]]s of 29 or 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/mesopotamiancalander.htm|title=Mesopotamia, Calendar|publisher=International World History Project|website=History-world.org|accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Each month began with the sighting of a new moon. Sumerian months had no uniform name throughout Sumer because of the religious diversity.&lt;ref name="brit"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/89368/calendar/60208/Babylonian-calendars|title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|entry=Calendar|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=Britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in scribes and scholars referring to them as "the first month", "the fifth month" etc. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} To keep the lunar year of 354 days in step with the solar year of 365.242 days an [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|extra month]] was added periodically, much like a [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] [[leap year]].&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There were no weeks in the Sumerian calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1947|last=Yust|first=Walter|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|page=576|title=Encyclopædia Britannica: A New Survey of Universal Knowledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holy days and time off from work were usually celebrated on the first, seventh and fifteenth of each month. In addition to these holy days, there were also feast days which varied from city to city.

==Antiquity==

===Babylonia and Persia===
{{further|Babylonian calendar|Zoroastrian calendar}}

Although the earliest evidence of Iranian calendrical traditions is from the [[second millennium BCE]], predating the appearance of the Iranian prophet [[Zoroaster]], the first fully preserved calendar is that of the [[Achaemenid]]s.  Throughout recorded history, [[Persian people|Persians]] have been keen on the idea and importance of having a [[calendar]]. They were among the first cultures to use a [[solar calendar]] and have long favoured a solar over [[lunar calendar|lunar]] and [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]] approaches. The sun has always been a symbol in [[Iranian culture]] and is closely related to the folklore regarding [[Cyrus the Great]].&lt;ref name=EI-C-i&gt;{{harv|Panaino|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Old Persian calendar ====
Old Persian inscriptions and tablets indicate that early Iranians used a [[360-day calendar]] based on the solar observation directly and modified for their beliefs. Days were not named. The months had two or three divisions depending on the phase of the moon. Twelve months of 30 days were named for festivals or activities of the [[pastoral]] year. A 13th month was added every six years to keep the calendar synchronized with the seasons.

==== Zoroastrian calendar ====
{{main|Zoroastrian calendar}}
The first calendars based on [[Zoroastrian calendar|Zoroastrian]] cosmology appeared in the later Achaemenid period (650 to 330 BCE). They evolved over the centuries, but month names changed little until now.

The unified [[Achaemenid Empire]] required a distinctive Iranian calendar, and one was devised in [[Egypt]]ian tradition, with 12 months of 30 days, each dedicated to a [[yazata]] (Eyzad), and four divisions resembling the Semitic week. Four days per month were dedicated to [[Ahura Mazda]] and seven were named after the six [[Amesha Spentas]]. Thirteen days were named after Fire, Water, Sun, Moon, [[Tiri, Estonia|Tiri]] and Geush Urvan (the soul of all animals), Mithra, [[Sraosha]] (Soroush, yazata of prayer), [[Rashnu]] (the Judge), [[Fravashi]], [[Verethragna|Bahram]] (yazata of victory), Raman (Ramesh meaning peace), and [[Vayu-Vata|Vata]], the divinity of the wind. Three were dedicated to the female divinities, [[Daena]] (yazata of religion and personified conscious), [[Ashi]] (yazata of fortune) and [[Arshtat]] (justice). The remaining four were dedicated to [[Asman]] (lord of sky or Heaven), [[Zam]] (earth), Manthra Spenta (the Bounteous Sacred Word) and Anaghra Raocha (the 'Endless Light' of paradise).

==== Modifications by Parthians, Ardashir I, Hormizd I, Yazdgerd III ====
The [[Parthia]]ns (Arsacid dynasty) adopted the same calendar system with minor modifications, and dated their era from 248 BCE, the date they succeeded the Seleucids. Their names for the months and days are Parthian equivalents of the Avestan ones used previously, differing slightly from the [[Middle Persian]] names used by the [[Sassanians]]. For example, in Achaemenid times the modern Persian month 'Day' was called Dadvah (Creator), in Parthian it was Datush and the Sassanians named it Dadv/Dai (Dadar in Pahlavi).

When in April of AD 224 the Parthian dynasty fell and was replaced by the Sasanid, the new king, [[Ardashir I]], abolished the official Babylonian calendar and replaced it with the Zoroastrian.   This involved a correction to the places of the ''gahanbar'', which had slipped back in the seasons since they were fixed.   These were placed eight months later, as were the ''epagemonai'', the 'Gatha' or 'Gah' days after the ancient Zoroastrian hymns of the same name.   Other countries, such as the Armenians and Choresmians, did not accept the change.

==== The formation of the current Persian calendar in the 11th century ====

[[Toghril Beg]], the founder of the [[Seljuq dynasty]], had made Esfahan the capital of his domains and his grandson [[Malik-Shah I|Malik-Shah]] was the ruler of that city from 1073. An invitation was sent to [[Khayyam]] from Malik-Shah and from his vizier [[Nizam al-Mulk]] asking Khayyam to go to Esfahan to set up an Observatory there. Other leading astronomers were also brought to the Observatory in Esfahan and for 18 years Khayyam led the scientists and produced work of outstanding quality. During this time Khayyam led work on compiling astronomical tables and he also contributed to calendar reform in 1079.

Cowell quotes [[The Calcutta Review]] No 59:-
''When the Malik Shah determined to reform the calendar, [[Omar Khayyam|Omar]] was one of the eight learned men employed to do it, the result was the Jalali era (so called from Jalal-ud-din, one of the king's names) - 'a computation of time,' says Gibbon, 'which surpasses the Julian, and approaches the accuracy of the Gregorian style.'''

Khayyam measured the length of the year as 365.24219858156 days. Two comments on this result. Firstly it shows an incredible confidence to attempt to give the result to this degree of accuracy. We know now that the length of the year is changing in the sixth decimal place over a person's lifetime. Secondly it is outstandingly accurate. For comparison the length of the year at the end of the 19th century was 365.242196 days, while today it is 365.242190 days.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Khayyam.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Greece===
The Greeks, as early as the time of [[Homer]], appear to have been familiar with the division of the year into the twelve lunar months but no intercalary month ''Embolimos'' or day is then mentioned. Independent of the division of a month into days, it was divided into periods according to the increase and decrease of the moon. 
Thus, the first day or new moon was called ''Noumenia''. The month in which the year began, as well as the names of the months, differed among the states, and in some parts even no names existed for the months, as they were distinguished only numerically, as the first, second, third, fourth month, etc.

The [[Attic calendar|ancient Athenian calendar]] was a [[lunisolar]] calendar with 354-day years, consisting of twelve months of alternating length of 29 or 30 days. To keep the calendar in line with the solar year of 365.242 days, an extra, intercalary month was added in every other year.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The Athenian months were called Hekatombion, Metageitnion, Boedromion, Pyanepsion, Maimakterion, Poseidon, Gamelion, Anthesterion, Elaphebolion, Munychion, Thargelion, and Skirophorion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ginzel: Handbuch der Mathematischen und Technischen Chronologie |year=1911 |volume=2 |publisher=F.K. |location=Germany |pages= 335–336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intercalary month usually came after Poseidon, and was called second Poseidon.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

In addition to their regular, "festival" calendar, the Athenians maintained a second, political calendar . This "conciliar" calendar divided the year into "[[prytanies]]", one for each of the "[[phylai]]", the subdivisions of Athenian citizens. The number of phylai, and hence the number of prytanies, varied over time. Until 307 BC, there were 10 phylai. After that the number varies between 11 and 13 (usually 12). Even more confusing, while the conciliar and festival years were about the same length in the 4th century BC, such was not regularly the case earlier or later. Documents dated by prytany are frequently very difficult to assign to a particular equivalent in the [[Julian calendar]].

The table of Greek Olympiads, following the four-year cycles between the [[Olympic Games]] from 1 July 776 BC, continued until the end of the 4th century AD.&lt;ref name="Davies267"&gt;Davies, p 267&lt;/ref&gt; The Babylonian Era of Nabonassar, beginning on 26 February 747 BC, was used by the Greeks of [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; It was later known in the Middle Ages from the works of [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;

===Hellenistic period===
{{further|Roman calendar}}

The Greek calendars were greatly diversified by the [[Hellenistic period]], with separate traditions in every Greek state.
Of primary importance for the reconstruction of the regional Greek calendars is the calendar of [[Delphi]], because of the numerous documents found there recording the manumission of slaves, many of which are dated both in the Delphian and in a regional calendar.

The Macedonian Era of the Seleucids, which began with the conquest of [[Babylon]] by [[Seleucus Nicator]] in 312 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; It became widely used in the [[Levant]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; The [[Jews]] knew it as the "era of contracts", and used it in Europe until the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;

The Roman Republican calendar numbered years based on the [[List of Roman consuls|sitting consuls]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; References to the year of consulship were used in both conversation and official records.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; Romans from the same family often had the same ''praenomen'', which sometimes makes it difficult to distinguish them, and there were two consuls at any one time, each of whom might sometimes hold the appointment more than once, meaning that it was (and is) necessary to be well educated in history to understand the references.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;  The Romans had an [[Nundinae|eight-day week]], with the market-day falling every eight days. It was called a ''nundinum'' or 'nine-day' in [[inclusive counting]].

Most of the regional [[Hindu calendar]]s are inherited  from a system standardized in classical [[Hindu astronomy]] 
as adopted via [[Indo-Greek]] transmission in the final centuries BCE, and  reformed by [[Gupta period|Gupta era]] astronomers such as [[Āryabhaṭa]] and [[Varahamihira|Varāhamihira]].

===China===
{{main|Chinese calendar}}
Before the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (before 770 BC), the Chinese Calendars were solar calendars.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} In the so-called  [[Wu Xing|five-phase]] calendar, the year consists of 10 months and a transition, each month being 36 days long, and the transitions 5 or 6 days. 
During the [[Warring States period]] (~475-220 BC), the primitive lunisolar calendars were established under the Zhou Dynasty, known as the six ancient calendars ({{zh|t=古六曆|s=古六历}}). The months of these calendars begin on the day with the new moon, with 12 or 13 months (lunations) in a year. The intercalary month is placed at the end of the year. In [[Qin China]], the Qin calendar ({{zh|t=秦曆|s=秦历}}) was introduced. It follows the rules of Zhuanxu's calendar, but the months order follows the Xia's calendar.

===Ancient India ===

Time keeping was important to Vedic rituals, and ''Jyotisha'' was the Vedic era field of tracking and predicting the movements of astronomical bodies in order to keep time, in order to fix the day and time of these rituals.&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsnijyotisa/&gt;&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca326/&gt;&lt;ref name="mullerhaslp210"&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrich Max Müller|title=A History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHCe48QSZaUC|year=1860|publisher=Williams and Norgate|pages=210–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was one of the six ancient [[Vedanga]]s, or ancillary science connected with the [[Vedas]] – the scriptures of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=monierwilliamsnijyotisa&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit–English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA353|year=1923|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jameslochtefeldsca326&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), "Jyotisha" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pages 326–327&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu calendar, sometimes referred to as ''Panchanga'', is a collective term for the various [[lunisolar calendar]]s traditionally used in [[Hinduism]].

The Hindu calendars have been in use in the Indian subcontinent since ancient times, and remains in use by the [[Hindu]]s in India and Nepal particularly to set the Hindu festival dates.

===Roman Empire===
{{main|Julian calendar}}
The old Roman year had 304 days divided into 10 months, beginning with [[Martius (month)|March]]. However the ancient historian Livy gave credit to the second early Roman king [[Numa Pompilius]] for devising a calendar of 12 months. The extra months ''[[Ianuarius]]'' and ''[[Februarius]]'' had been invented, supposedly by Numa Pompilius, as stop-gaps.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; Julius Caesar realized that the system had become inoperable, so he effected drastic changes in the year of his third consulship.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; The [[New Year]] in 709 AUC &lt;!--Book typo as 707 AUC--&gt; began on 1 January and ran over 365 days until 31 December.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; Further adjustments were made under Augustus, who introduced the concept of the "leap year" in 757 AUC (AD 4){{Fix|text=conversion is 1 year out}}.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; The resultant [[Julian calendar]] remained in almost universal use in Europe until 1582,&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; and in some countries until as late as the twentieth century.

[[Marcus Terentius Varro]] introduced the ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'' epoch, assuming a foundation of Rome in 753 BC. The system remained in use during the early Middle Ages until the widespread adoption of the [[Dionysian era]] in the [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian period]].

In the Roman Empire, the AUC year could be used alongside the consular year, so that the consulship of [[Quintus Fufius Calenus]] and [[Publius Vatinius]] could be determined as 707 AUC (or 47 BC), the third consulship of [[Julius Caesar|Caius Julius Caesar]], with [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], as 708 AUC (or 46 BC), and the fourth consulship of Gaius Julius Caesar as 709 AUC (or 45 BC).&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;

The seven-day [[week]] has a tradition reaching back to the ancient Near East, but the introduction of the "planetary week" which remains in modern use dates to the Roman Empire period (see also [[names of the days of the week]]).

===Christian Europe===

{{main|Anno Domini}}
For the first six centuries since the birth of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], European countries used various local systems to count years, most usually [[regnal year]]s, modeled on the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; In some cases, [[Anno Mundi|Creation dating]] was also used. In the 6th century, the Christian monk [[Dionysius Exiguus]] devised the ''[[Anno Domini]]'' system, dating from the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; In the 8th century, the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] historian [[Bede|Bede the Venerable]] used another [[Latin]] term, "''ante uero incarnationis dominicae tempus''" ("the time before the Lord's true incarnation", equivalent to the [[English language|English]] "before Christ"), to identify years before the first year of this era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Historiam Ecclesiasticam Gentis Anglorum: Liber Primus |language=Latin | author=[[Bede]] |url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bede/bede1.shtml|publisher=Thelatinlibrary.com |accessdate=2008-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], even Popes continued to date documents according to [[regnal years]], and usage of AD only gradually became common in Europe from the 11th to the 14th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last [[Western Europe]]an country to adopt the ''Anno Domini'' system.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

In 1267, the medieval scientist [[Roger Bacon]] stated the times of full moons as a number of hours, minutes, seconds, thirds, and fourths (''horae'', ''minuta'', ''secunda'', ''tertia'', and ''quarta'') after noon on specified calendar dates.&lt;ref&gt;''The [[Opus Majus]] of Roger Bacon'', tr. Robert Belle Burke (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1928, reprinted 2000) table facing page 231, {{ISBN|978-1-85506-856-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a third for {{frac|1|60}} of a second remains in some languages, for example [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ثالثة, the modern second is further divided [[decimal]]ly.

Rival [[calendar era]]s to ''Anno Domini'' remained in use in Christian Europe.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; In Spain, the "Era of the Caesars" was dated from Octavian's conquest of Iberia in 39 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt; It was adopted by the [[Visigoths]] and remained in use in [[Catalonia]] until 1180, [[Crown of Castile|Castille]] until 1382 and Portugal until 1415.&lt;ref name="Davies267"/&gt;

For chronological purposes, the flaw of the Anno Domini system was that dates have to be reckoned backwards or forwards according as they are BC or AD. According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', "in an ideally perfect system all events would be reckoned in one sequence. The difficulty was to find a starting point whence to reckon, for the beginnings of history in which this should naturally be placed are those of which chronologically we know least."{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} For both Christians and [[Jews]], the prime historical date was the Year of Creation, or ''[[Annus Mundi]]''.&lt;ref name="Davies268"&gt;Davies, p 268&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] fixed the date of Creation at 5509 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies268"/&gt; This remained the basis of the ecclesiastical calendar in the [[Greek Orthodox|Greek]] and [[Russian Orthodox]] world until modern times.&lt;ref name="Davies268"/&gt; The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] fixed on 5500 BC. Later, the [[Church of England]], under [[Archbishop Ussher]] in 1650, would pick 4004 BC.&lt;ref name="Davies268"/&gt;

===Bulgar calendar===
The [[Bulgar calendar]] was a calendar system used by the [[Bulgars]], a seminomadic people, originally from Central Asia, who from the 2nd century onwards dwelled in the Eurasian steppes north of the Caucasus and around the banks of river Volga. In 681 part of the Bulgars settled in the Balkan peninsula and established Bulgaria. The main source of information used for reconstruction of the Bulgar calendar is a short 15th century transcript, which contains 10 pairs of calendar terms, the same dating system being found in a marginal note of a manuscript from the 10th c. According to the reconstructed calendar, the Bulgars used a 12-year cyclic calendar similar to the one adopted by Turkic peoples from the [[Chinese calendar]], with names and numbers that are deciphered as in Bulgar language.

===Islamic calendar===
The [[Islamic calendar]] is based on the prohibition of intercalation (''[[nasi']]'') by [[Muhammad]], in Islamic tradition dated to a sermon held on  9 [[Dhu al-Hijjah]] AH 10 (Julian date: 6 March 632). This resulted in an observationally based lunar calendar shifting relative to the seasons of the solar year.

===Icelandic calendar===
{{main|Icelandic calendar}}
In medieval Iceland, a calendar was introduced in the 10th century. While the ancient [[Germanic calendar]]s were based on lunar months, the new Icelandic calendar introduced  a purely solar reckoning, with a year having a fixed number of weeks (52 weeks or 364 days). This necessitated the introduction of "leap weeks" instead of the Julian leap days.

===Indo-Islamic calendars===
{{See also|Fasli calendar}} 
During the Mughal rule, land taxes were collected from Bengali people according to the Islamic Hijri calendar. This calendar was a lunar calendar, and its new year did not coincide with the solar agricultural cycles. According to some sources, Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] asked his royal astronomer [[Fathullah Shirazi]] to create a new calendar by combining the lunar [[Islamic Calendar|Islamic calendar]] and solar [[Hindu calendar]] already in use, and this was known as ''Fasholi shan'' (harvest calendar).&lt;ref name= Chakrabarti114&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kunal Chakrabarti|author2=Shubhra Chakrabarti|title=Historical Dictionary of the Bengalis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVOFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114 |year= 2013|publisher =Scarecrow|isbn= 978-0-8108-8024-5|pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=banglapedia&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2015 |title=Pahela Baishakh |encyclopedia=Banglapedia |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh |location=Dhaka, Bangladesh |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Pahela_Baishakh}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Amartya Sen]], Akbar's official calendar "Tarikh-ilahi" with the zero year of 1556 CE was a blend of pre-existing Hindu and Islamic calendars.

Of all the ancient calendar systems, the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and other [[Mesoamerican]] systems are the most complex. The [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n calendar had 2 years, the 260-day Sacred Round, or ''tzolkin'', and the 365-day Vague Year, or ''haab''.&lt;ref name="maya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilization.ca/civil/maya/mmc06eng.html |title=Maya civilization |accessdate=2008-04-03 |publisher=Civilization.ca |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305074426/http://www.civilization.ca/civil/maya/mmc06eng.html |archivedate=5 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MAYA-g-log-cal-D20-Ajaw.png|thumb|right|200px|A modern pictogram of the Mayan god [[Kinich Ahau|Ahau]], after which the 20th day of the ''tzolkin'' cycle was named]]
The Sacred Round of 260 days is composed of two smaller cycles: the numbers 1 through 13, coupled with 20 different day names: Imix, Ik, Akbal, Kan, Chicchan, Cimi, Manik, Lamat, Muluc, Oc, Chuen, Eb, Ben, Ix, Men, Cib, Caban, Eiznab, Cauac, and Ahau. The Sacred Round was used to determine important activities related to the gods and humans: name individuals, predict the future, decide on auspicious dates for battles, marriages, and so on.&lt;ref name="maya"/&gt;

The two cycles of 13 and 20 intermesh and are repeated without interruption: the cycle would begin with 1 Imix, then 2 Ik, then 3 Akbal and so on until the number 13 was reached, at which point the number cycle was restarted so 13 Ben would be followed by 1 Ix, 2 Men and so on. This time Imix would be numbered 8. The cycle ended after 260 days, with the last day being 13 Ahau.&lt;ref name="maya" /&gt;

The Vague Year of 365 days is similar to our [[Gregorian calendar|modern calendar]], consisting of 18 months of 20 days each, with an unlucky five-day period at the end. The Vague Year had to do primarily with the seasons and agriculture, and was based on the solar cycle. The 18 Maya months are known, in order, as: Pop, Uo, Zip, Zotz, Tzec, Xuc, Yaxkin, Mol, Chen, Yax, Zac, Ceh, Mac, Kankin, Maun, Pax, Kayab and Cumku. The unlucky five-day period was known as [[Uayeb]], and was considered a time which could hold danger, death and bad luck.&lt;ref name="maya" /&gt;

The Vague Year began with the month of Pop. The Maya 20-day month always begins with the seating of the month, followed by days numbered 1 to 19, then the seating of the following month, and so on. This ties in with the Maya notion that each month influences the next. The Maya new year would start with 1 Pop, followed by 2 Pop, all the way through to 19 Pop, followed by the seating of the month of Uo, written as 0 Uo, then 1 Uo, 2 Uo and so on. These two cycles coincided every 52 years. The 52-year period of time was called a "bundle" and was similar to a modern-day century.&lt;ref name="maya"/&gt;

The '''history of sound recording''' - which has progressed in waves, driven by the invention and commercial introduction of new technologies&amp;nbsp;— can be roughly divided into four main periods:
* the "Acoustic" era, 1877 to 1925
* the "Electrical" era, 1925 to 1945 (including sound on film)
* the "Magnetic" era, 1945 to 1975
* the "Digital" Era, 1975 to the present day.

Experiments in capturing sound on a recording medium for preservation and reproduction began in earnest during the [[Industrial Revolution]] of the 1800s. Many pioneering attempts to record and reproduce sound were made during the latter half of the 19th century&amp;nbsp;– notably Scott's [[Phonautograph]] of 1857&amp;nbsp;– and these efforts culminated in the invention of the [[phonograph]] by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1877. Digital recording emerged in the late 20th century, and has since flourished with the popularity of digital music and online streaming services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartmanski|first=Dominik|last2=Woodward|first2=Ian|title=The vinyl: The analogue medium in the age of digital reproduction|url=http://journals.sagepub.com.proxyau.wrlc.org/doi/full/10.1177/1469540513488403|journal=Journal of Consumer Culture|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=3–27|doi=10.1177/1469540513488403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
[[File:Actor portraying Alexander Graham Bell in an AT&amp;T promotional film (1926).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|In the early days of sound recording, acoustic recording devices still used horns instead of microphones. Image displays a mid-1920s re-enactment of [[Alexander Graham Bell]] inventing the telephone]]
===The Acoustic Era (1877 to 1925)===
The earliest practical recording technologies were entirely mechanical devices. These recorders typically used a large conical horn to collect and focus the physical air pressure of the sound waves produced by the human voice or musical instruments. A sensitive membrane or diaphragm, located at the apex of the cone, was connected to an articulated scriber or stylus, and as the changing air pressure moved the diaphragm back and forth, the stylus scratched or incised an [[analog recording|analogue]] of the sound waves onto a moving recording medium, such as a roll of coated paper, or a cylinder or disc coated with a soft material such as [[wax]] or a soft metal. These early recordings were necessarily of low fidelity and volume, and captured only a narrow segment of the audible sound spectrum&amp;nbsp;— typically only from around 250&amp;nbsp;Hz up to about 2,500&amp;nbsp;Hz — so musicians and engineers were forced to adapt to these sonic limitations. Bands of the period often favored louder instruments such as trumpet, cornet and trombone, lower-register brass instruments (such as the tuba and the euphonium) replaced the string bass, and blocks of wood stood in for bass drums; performers also had to arrange themselves strategically around the horn to balance the sound, and to play as loudly as possible. The reproduction of domestic phonographs was similarly limited in both frequency-range and volume. By the end of the acoustic era, the disc had become the standard medium for sound recording, and its dominance in the domestic audio market lasted until the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.charm.rhul.ac.uk/history/p20_4_1.html|title=A Brief History of Recording to ca. 1950|website=www.charm.rhul.ac.uk|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Electrical Era (1925 to 1945) (including sound on film)===
[[File:Microphone - Bayernhof Museum - DSC06319.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Ring-and-spring microphones, such as this Western Electric microphone, were common during the electrical age of sound recording c. 1925-1945]]
The 'second wave' of sound recording history was ushered in by the introduction of [[Western Electric]]'s integrated system of electrical microphones, electronic signal amplifiers and electromechanical recorders,&lt;!-- Only the recording heads were installed by WE when a licensee's "disc-cutting machines" were changed over to the new technology; their existing turntables and feed screw mechanisms, typically powered by a weight-driven motor rather than electricity, usually worked well and were not altered --&gt; which was adopted by major US record labels in 1925. Sound recording now became a [[:wikt:hybrid|hybrid]] process&amp;nbsp;— sound could now be captured, amplified, filtered and balanced electronically, and the disc-cutting head was now electrically powered, but the actual recording process remained essentially mechanical&amp;nbsp;– the signal was still physically inscribed into a wax 'master' disc, and consumer discs were mass-produced mechanically by stamping a metal [[Electroforming|electroform]] made from the wax master into a suitable substance, originally a [[shellac]]-based compound and later [[polyvinyl]] plastic. The Western Electric system greatly improved the fidelity of sound recording, increasing the reproducible frequency range to a much wider band (between 60&amp;nbsp;Hz and 6000&amp;nbsp;Hz) and allowing a new class of professional&amp;nbsp;– the audio engineer&amp;nbsp;– to capture a fuller, richer and more detailed and balanced sound on record, using multiple microphones connected to multi-channel electronic amplifiers, compressors, filters and [[Mixing console|mixers]]. Electrical microphones led to a dramatic change in the performance style of singers, ushering in the age of the "[[crooner]]", while electronic amplification had a wide-ranging impact in many areas, enabling the development of  broadcast radio, public address systems, and electronically-amplified home record players&lt;!-- "record player" nicely avoids the UK-US "gramophone"-"phonograph" conflict --&gt;. In addition, the development of electronic amplifiers for musical instruments now enabled quieter instruments such as the guitar and the string bass to compete on equal terms with the naturally louder wind and horn instruments, and musicians and composers also began to experiment with entirely new electronic musical instruments such as the [[Theremin]], the [[Ondes Martenot]], the [[electronic organ]], and the Hammond [[Novachord]], the world's first analogue polyphonic [[synthesiser]].

Contemporaneous with these developments, several inventors were engaged in a race to develop practical methods of providing synchronised sound with films. Some early [[sound film]]s&amp;nbsp;— such as the landmark 1927 film ''[[The Jazz Singer]]''&amp;nbsp;– used [[Vitaphone|large soundtrack records]] which were played on a turntable mechanically interlocked with the [[Movie projector|projector]]. By the early 1930s the movie industry had almost universally adopted [[sound-on-film]] technology, in which the audio signal to be recorded was used to modulate a light source that was imaged onto the moving film through a narrow slit, allowing it to be photographed as variations in the density or width of a "sound track" running along a dedicated area of the film. The projector used a steady light and a [[photodetector|photoelectric cell]] to convert the variations back into an electrical signal, which was amplified and sent to [[loudspeaker]]s behind the screen. The adoption of sound-on-film also helped movie-industry audio engineers to make rapid advances in the process we now know as "multi-tracking", by which multiple separately-recorded audio sources (such as voices, sound effects and background music) can be replayed simultaneously, mixed together, and synchronised with the action on film to create new 'blended' audio tracks of great sophistication and complexity. One of the best-known examples of a 'constructed' composite sound from that era is the famous "[[Tarzan yell]]" created for the series of Tarzan movies starring [[Johnny Weissmuller]].

Among the vast and often rapid changes that have taken place over the last century of audio recording, it is notable that there is one crucial audio device, invented at the start of the "Electrical Era", which has survived virtually unchanged since its introduction in the 1920s: the electro-acoustic transducer, or [[loudspeaker]]. The most common form is the [[dynamic loudspeaker]]&amp;nbsp;– effectively a [[dynamic microphone]] in reverse. This device typically consists of a shallow conical diaphragm, usually of a stiff paper-like material concentrically pleated to make it more flexible, firmly fastened at its perimeter, with the coil of a moving-coil electromagnetic driver attached around its apex. When an audio signal from a recording, a microphone, or an electrified instrument is fed through an amplifier to the loudspeaker, the varying electromagnetic field created in the coil causes it and the attached cone to move backward and forward, and this movement generates the audio-frequency pressure waves that travel through the air to our ears, which hear them as sound. Although there have been numerous refinements to the technology, and other related technologies have been introduced (e.g. the [[electrostatic loudspeaker]]), the basic design and function of the dynamic loudspeaker has not changed substantially in 90 years, and it remains overwhelmingly the most common, sonically accurate and reliable means of converting electronic audio signals back into audible sound.

===The Magnetic Era (1945 to 1976)===
[[File:Studer1969.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|During the magnetic era, sound recordings were usually made on magnetic tape before being transferred to other media]]
The third wave of development in audio recording began in 1945, when the allied nations gained access to a new German invention - [[magnetic tape]] recording. The technology was invented in the 1930s, but remained restricted to Germany (where it was widely used in broadcasting) until the end of World War II. Magnetic tape provided another dramatic leap in audio fidelity&amp;nbsp;— indeed, Allied observers first became aware of the existence of the new technology because they noticed that the audio quality of obviously pre-recorded programs was practically indistinguishable from live broadcasts. From 1950 onwards, magnetic tape quickly became the standard medium of audio master recording in the radio and music industries, and led to the development of the first hi-fi [[stereo]] recordings for the domestic market, the development of [[multi-track tape recording]] for music, and the demise of the disc as the primary mastering medium for sound. Magnetic tape also brought about a radical reshaping of the recording process&amp;nbsp;— it made possible recordings of far longer duration and much higher fidelity than ever before, and it offered recording engineers the same exceptional plasticity that film gave to cinema editors&amp;nbsp;— sounds captured on tape could now easily be manipulated sonically, edited, and combined in ways that were simply impossible with disc recordings. These experiments reached an early peak in the 1950s with the recordings of [[Les Paul]] and [[Mary Ford]], who pioneered the use of tape editing and "multi-tracking" to create large 'virtual' ensembles of voices and instruments, constructed entirely from multiple taped recordings of their own voices and instruments. Magnetic tape fueled a rapid and radical expansion in the sophistication of popular music and other genres, allowing composers, producers, engineers and performers to realize previously unattainable levels of complexity. Other concurrent advances in audio technology led to the introduction of a range of new consumer audio formats and devices, on both disc and tape, including the development full-frequency-range disc reproduction, the change from shellac to polyvinyl plastic for disc manufacture, the invention of the 33rpm, 12-inch long-playing (LP) disc and the 45rpm 7-inch "single", the introduction of domestic and professional portable tape recorders (which enabled high-fidelity recordings of live performances), the popular [[4-track cartridge]] and [[compact cassette]] formats, and even the world's first "sampling keyboards" - the pioneering tape-based keyboard instrument the [[Chamberlin]], and its more famous successor, the [[Mellotron]].

===The Digital Era (1975 to Present)===
[[File:Peter Francken in his studio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|In the digital era, audio recording becomes increasingly dominated by [[digital audio workstation]]s (DAW)]]
The fourth and current "phase", the "digital" era, has seen the most rapid, dramatic and far-reaching series of changes in the history of audio recording. In a period of less than 20 years, all previous recording technologies were rapidly superseded by digital sound encoding, which was perfected by the Japanese electronics corporation [[Sony]] in the 1970s. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Unlike all previous technologies, which captured a continuous analogue of the sounds being recorded, digital recording captured sound by means of a very dense and rapid series of discrete  samples of the sound&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

When played back through a digital-to-analogue converter, these audio samples are recombined to form a continuous flow of sound. The first all-digitally-recorded popular music album, [[Ry Cooder]]'s ''[[Bop 'Til You Drop]]'', was released in 1979, and from that point, digital sound recording and reproduction quickly became the new standard at every level, from the professional recording studio to the home hi-fi.

Although a number of short-lived "hybrid" studio and consumer technologies appeared in this period (e.g. Digital Audio Tape or DAT, which recorded digital signal samples onto standard magnetic tape), Sony assured the preeminence of its new digital recording system by introducing, together with Philips, the most advanced consumer audio format to date&amp;nbsp;— the digital [[compact disc]] (CD). The Compact disc rapidly replaced both the 12" album and the 7" single as the new standard consumer format, and ushered in a new era of high-fidelity consumer audio&amp;nbsp;— CDs were small, portable and durable, and they could reproduce the entire audible sound spectrum, with unrestricted dynamic range, perfect clarity and no distortion. Because CDs were encoded and read optically, using a [[laser]] beam, there was no physical contact between the disc and the playback mechanism, so a well-cared-for CD could be played over and over, with absolutely no degradation or loss of fidelity. CDs also represented a considerable advance in both the physical size of the medium, and its storage capacity&amp;nbsp;— LPs could only practically hold about 50 minutes of audio, because they were physically limited by the size of the disc itself and the density of the grooves that could be cut into it&amp;nbsp;— the longer the recording, the closer together the grooves and thus the lower the overall fidelity; CDs, on the other hand they were less than half the overall size of the old 12" LP format, but offered about double the duration of the average LP, with up to 80 minutes of audio&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society

The Compact Disc almost totally dominated the consumer audio market by the end of the 20th century, but within another decade, rapid developments in computing technology saw it rendered virtually redundant in just a few years by the most significant new invention in the history of audio recording&amp;nbsp;— the digital audio file (.wav, .mp3 and other formats). When combined with newly developed digital signal compression algorithms, which greatly reduced file sizes, digital audio files rapidly came to dominate the domestic market, thanks to commercial innovations such as Apple's [[iTunes]] media application, and their hugely popular [[iPod]] portable media player.

However, the introduction of digital audio files, in concert with the rapid developments in home computing, soon led to an unforeseen consequence&amp;nbsp;— the widespread unlicensed distribution of audio and other digital media files. The uploading and downloading of large volumes of digital media files at high speed was facilitated by [[freeware]] file sharing technologies such as [[Napster]] and [[BitTorrent]]. The concurrent development of high-volume private data storage networks, combined with rapidly increasing internet signal speeds and continuous improvements in data storage devices, fuelled an explosion in the illegal sharing of copyrighted digital media. This has caused great consternation among record labels and copyright owners such as [[ASCAP]], who have strongly pressured government agencies to make trans-national efforts to shut down data-storage and file-sharing networks, and to prosecute site operators, and even individual downloaders.

Although infringement remains a significant issue for copyright owners, the development of digital audio has had considerable benefits for consumers. In addition to facilitating the high-volume, low-cost transfer and storage of digital audio files, this new technology has also powered an explosion in the availability of so-called "back-catalogue" titles stored in the archives of recording labels, thanks to the fact that labels can now convert old recordings and distribute them digitally at a fraction of the cost of physically reissuing albums on LP or CD. Digital audio has also enabled dramatic improvements in the restoration and remastering of acoustic and pre-digital electric recordings, and even freeware consumer-level digital software can very effectively eliminate scratches, surface noise and other unwanted sonic artefacts from old 78rpm and vinyl recordings and greatly enhance the sound quality of all but the most badly damaged records. In the field of consumer-level digital data storage, the continuing trend towards increasing capacity and falling costs means that consumers can now acquire and store vast quantities of high-quality digital media (audio, video, games and other applications), and build up media libraries consisting of tens or even hundreds of thousands of songs, albums, or videos&amp;nbsp;— collections which, for all but the wealthiest, would have been both physically and financially impossible to amass in such quantities if they were on 78 or LP, yet which can now be contained on storage devices no larger than the average hardcover book.

The Digital Audio File marked the end of one era in recording and the beginning of another. Digital files effectively eliminated the need to create or use a discrete, purpose-made physical recording medium (a disc, or a reel of tape, etc.) as the primary means of capturing, manufacturing and distributing commercial sound recordings. Concurrent with the development of these digital file formats, dramatic advances in home computing and the rapid expansion of the [[Internet]] mean that digital sound recordings can now be captured, processed, reproduced, distributed and stored entirely electronically, on a range of magnetic and optical recording media, and these can be distributed almost anywhere in the world, with no loss of fidelity, and crucially, without the need to first transfer these files to some form of permanent recording medium for shipment and sale.

Music streaming services have gained popularity since the late 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&amp;sid=8b7c5da7-05b0-4bb1-8a3a-60ca93d18302@sessionmgr4008|title=The Spotify Paradox: How the Creation of a Compulsory License Scheme for St...: EBSCOhost|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streaming audio does not require the listener to download or own the audio files.

==Acoustical recording==
The earliest method of [[sound recording and reproduction]] involved the live recording of a performance directly to a [[recording medium]] by an entirely mechanical process, often called "acoustical recording". In the standard procedure used until the mid-1920s, the [[sound]]s generated by the performance vibrated a [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] with a recording [[stylus]] connected to it while the stylus cut a groove into a soft recording medium rotating beneath it. To make this process as efficient as possible, the diaphragm was located at the apex of a hollow cone that served to collect and focus the acoustical energy, with the performers crowded around the other end. Recording balance was achieved empirically. A performer who recorded too strongly or not strongly enough would be moved away from or nearer to the mouth of the cone. The number and kind of instruments that could be recorded were limited. Brass instruments, which recorded well, often substituted instruments such as cellos and bass fiddles, which did not. In some early [[jazz]] recordings, a block of wood was used in place of the [[bass drum]], which could easily overload the recording diaphragm.

===Phonautograph===
{{Main|Phonautograph}}

In 1857, [[Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville]] invented the [[phonautograph]], the first device that could record sound waves as they passed through the air. It was intended only for visual study of the recording and could not play back the sound. The recording medium was a sheet of soot-coated paper wrapped around a rotating cylinder carried on a threaded rod. A [[Stylus#Use in music recording and reproduction|stylus]], attached to a diaphragm through a series of levers, traced a line through the soot, creating a graphic record of the motions of the diaphragm as it was minutely propelled back and forth by the audio-frequency variations in air pressure.

In the spring of 1877 another inventor, [[Charles Cros]], suggested that the process could be reversed by using [[photoengraving]] to convert the traced line into a groove that would guide the stylus, causing the original stylus vibrations to be recreated, passed on to the linked diaphragm, and sent back into the air as sound. An inventor from America{{who|date=April 2018}} soon eclipsed this idea, and it was not until 1887 that yet another inventor, [[Emile Berliner]], actually photoengraved a phonautograph recording into metal and played it back.

Scott's early recordings languished in French archives until 2008, when scholars keen to resurrect the sounds captured in these and other types of early experimental recordings tracked them down. Rather than using rough 19th century technology to create playable versions, they were scanned into a computer and software was used to convert their sound-modulated traces into digital audio files. Brief excerpts from two French songs and a recitation in Italian, all recorded in 1860, are the most substantial results.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstsounds.org Information on the recordings and their resurrection direct from the source. Careless reporting and errors abound in many of the secondary and nth-generation accounts.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phonograph/Gramophone===
{{See also|Volta Laboratory|Graphophone}}
[[File:EdisonPhonograph.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An Edison Home Phonograph for recording and playing brown wax cylinders, c. 1899]]

The [[phonograph]], invented by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1877,&lt;ref&gt;Kernfeld, Barry. "Recording." Grove Music Online (2007). Oxford Music Online. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; could both record sound and play it back. The earliest type of phonograph sold recorded on a thin sheet of tinfoil wrapped around a grooved metal cylinder. A stylus connected to a sound-vibrated diaphragm indented the foil into the groove as the cylinder rotated. The stylus vibration was at a right angle to the recording surface, so the depth of the indentation varied with the audio-frequency changes in air pressure that carried the sound. This arrangement is known as vertical or "hill-and-dale" recording. The sound could be played back by tracing the stylus along the recorded groove and acoustically coupling its resulting vibrations to the surrounding air through the diaphragm and a so-called "amplifying" horn.

The crude tinfoil phonograph proved to be of little use except as a novelty. It was not until the late 1880s that an improved and much more useful form of phonograph was marketed. The new machines recorded on easily removable [[Phonograph cylinder|hollow wax cylinders]] and the groove was engraved into the surface rather than indented. The targeted use was business communication, and in that context the cylinder format had some advantages. When entertainment use proved to be the real source of profits, one seemingly negligible disadvantage became a major problem: the difficulty of making copies of a recorded cylinder in large quantities.

At first, cylinders were copied by acoustically connecting a playback machine to one or more recording machines through flexible tubing, an arrangement that degraded the audio quality of the copies. Later, a [[pantograph]] mechanism was used, but it could only produce about 25 fair copies before the original was too worn down. During a recording session, as many as a dozen machines could be arrayed in front of the performers to record multiple originals. Still, a single "take" would ultimately yield only a few hundred copies at best, so performers were booked for marathon recording sessions in which they had to repeat their most popular numbers over and over again. By 1902, successful molding processes for manufacturing prerecorded cylinders had been developed.

[[File:Grammofon, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|right|150px|Spring-motor-powered disc record player, c. 1909]]

The wax cylinder got a competitor with the advent of the Gramophone, which was [[patent]]ed by [[Emile Berliner]] in 1887. The vibration of the Gramophone's recording stylus was horizontal, parallel to the recording surface, resulting in a zig-zag groove of constant depth. This is known as lateral recording. Berliner's original patent showed a lateral recording etched around the surface of a cylinder, but in practice he opted for the disc format. The Gramophones he soon began to market were intended solely for playing prerecorded entertainment discs and could not be used to record. The spiral groove on the flat surface of a disc was relatively easy to replicate: a negative metal [[electrotype]] of the original record could be used to stamp out hundreds or thousands of copies before it wore out. Early on, the copies were made of [[hard rubber]], and sometimes of [[celluloid]], but soon a [[shellac]]-based compound was adopted.

"Gramophone", Berliner's trademark name, was abandoned in the US in 1900 because of legal complications, with the result that in [[American English]] Gramophones and Gramophone records, along with disc records and players made by other manufacturers, were long ago brought under the umbrella term "phonograph", a word which Edison's competitors avoided using but which was never his trademark, simply a generic term he introduced and applied to cylinders, discs, tapes and any other formats capable of carrying a sound-modulated groove. In the UK, proprietary use of the name Gramophone continued for another decade until, in a court case, it was adjudged to have become [[Generic trademark|genericized]] and so could be used freely by competing disc record makers, with the result that in [[British English]] a disc record is called a "gramophone record" and "phonograph record" is traditionally assumed to mean a cylinder.

Not all cylinder records are alike. They were made of various soft or hard waxy formulations or early plastics, sometimes in unusual sizes; did not all use the same groove pitch; and were not all recorded at the same speed. Early brown wax cylinders were usually cut at about 120&amp;nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], whereas later cylinders ran at 160&amp;nbsp;rpm for clearer and louder sound at the cost of reduced maximum playing time. As a medium for entertainment, the cylinder was already losing the format war with the disc by 1910, but the production of entertainment cylinders did not entirely cease until 1929 and use of the format for business dictation purposes persisted into the 1950s.

Disc records, too, were sometimes made in unusual sizes, or from unusual materials, or otherwise deviated from the format norms of their eras in some substantial way. The speed at which disc records were rotated was eventually standardized at about 78&amp;nbsp;rpm, but other speeds were sometimes used. Around 1950, slower speeds became standard: 45, 33⅓, and the rarely used 16⅔&amp;nbsp;rpm. The standard material for discs changed from shellac to [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], although vinyl had been used for some special-purpose records since the early 1930s and some 78&amp;nbsp;rpm shellac records were still being made in the late 1950s.

==Electrical recording==
{{Main|Sound recording and reproduction#Electrical recording}}

Until the mid-1920s records were played on purely mechanical record players usually powered by a wind-up spring motor. The sound was "amplified" by an external or internal horn that was coupled to the [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] and [[stylus]], although there was no real amplification: the horn simply improved the efficiency with which the diaphragm's vibrations were transmitted into the open air. The recording process was in essence the same non-electronic setup operating in reverse, but with a recording stylus engraving a groove into a soft waxy master disc and carried slowly inward across it by a feed mechanism.

The advent of electrical recording in 1925 made it possible to use sensitive [[microphone]]s to capture the sound and greatly improved the audio quality of records. A much wider range of frequencies could be recorded, the balance of high and low frequencies could be controlled by elementary electronic filters, and the signal could be amplified to the optimum level for driving the recording stylus. The leading [[record label]]s switched to the electrical process in 1925 and the rest soon followed, although one straggler in the US held out until 1929.

There was a period of nearly five years, from 1925 to 1930, when the top "[[audiophile]]" technology for home sound reproduction consisted of a combination of electrically recorded records with the specially-developed [[Victor Orthophonic Victrola]], an acoustic phonograph that used [[waveguide]] engineering and a [[folded horn]] to provide a reasonably flat [[frequency response]]. The first electronically amplified record players reached the market only a few months later, around the start of 1926, but at first they were much more expensive and their audio quality was impaired by their primitive [[loudspeaker]]s; they did not become common until the late 1930s.

Electrical recording increased the flexibility of the process, but the performance was still cut directly to the recording medium, so if a mistake was made the whole recording was spoiled. Disc-to-disc editing was possible, by using multiple turntables to play parts of different "takes" and recording them to a new master disc, but switching sources with split-second accuracy was difficult and lower sound quality was inevitable, so except for use in editing some [[Vitaphone|early sound films]] and [[Transcription disc#Notable uses|radio recordings]] it was rarely done.

Electrical recording made it more feasible to record one part to disc and then play that back while playing another part, recording both parts to a second disc. This and conceptually related techniques, known as ''[[overdubbing]]'', enabled studios to create recorded "performances" that feature one or more artists each singing multiple parts or playing multiple instrument parts and that therefore could not be duplicated by the same artist or artists performing live. The first commercially issued records using overdubbing were released by the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] in the late 1920s. However overdubbing was of limited use until the advent of [[audio tape]]. Use of tape overdubbing was pioneered by [[Les Paul]] in the 1940s.

==Magnetic recording==
{{Main|Magnetic recording}}

===Magnetic wire recording===
{{Main|Magnetic wire recording}}

Wire recording or magnetic wire recording is an analog type of audio storage in which a magnetic recording is made on thin steel or stainless steel wire.

The wire is pulled rapidly across a recording head, which magnetizes each point along the wire in accordance with the intensity and polarity of the electrical audio signal being supplied to the recording head at that instant. By later drawing the wire across the same or a similar head while the head is not being supplied with an electrical signal, the varying magnetic field presented by the passing wire induces a similarly varying electric current in the head, recreating the original signal at a reduced level.

Magnetic wire recording was replaced by magnetic tape recording, but devices employing one or the other of these media had been more or less simultaneously under development for many years before either came into widespread use. The principles and electronics involved are nearly identical. Wire recording initially had the advantage that the recording medium itself was already fully developed, while tape recording was held back by the need to improve the materials and methods used to manufacture the tape.

Magnetic recording was demonstrated in principle as early as 1898 by [[Valdemar Poulsen]] in his [[telegraphone]]. Magnetic wire recording, and its successor, [[magnetic tape recording]], involve the use of a magnetized medium which moves with a constant speed past a [[recording head]]. An electrical signal, which is analogous to the sound that is to be recorded, is fed to the recording head, inducing a pattern of magnetization similar to the signal. A playback head can then pick up the changes in magnetic field from the tape and convert it into an electrical signal.

With the addition of electronic amplification developed by Curt Stille in the 1920s, the telegraphone evolved into [[wire recording|wire recorders]] which were popular for voice recording and [[dictation machine|dictation]] during the 1940s and into the 1950s. The reproduction quality of wire recorders was significantly lower than that achievable with phonograph disk recording technology. There were also practical difficulties, such as the tendency of the wire to become tangled or snarled. Splicing could be performed by knotting together the cut wire ends, but the results were not very satisfactory.

On Christmas Day, 1932 the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] first used a steel tape recorder for their broadcasts. The device used was a Marconi-Stille recorder,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orbem.co.uk/tapes/ms.htm|title=The Marconi-Stille|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a huge and dangerous machine which used steel tape that had sharp edges.  The tape was {{convert|0.1|in|mm}} wide and {{convert|0.003|in|mm}} thick running at {{convert|5|ft/s|m/s}} past the recording and reproducing heads. This meant that the length of tape required for a half-hour programme was nearly {{convert|1.8|mi|km}} and a full reel weighed {{convert|55|lb|kg}}.

===Magnetic tape sound recording===
{{Main|Magnetic tape sound recording}}
[[File:Reelt ubt.jpeg|right|200px|thumb|7" reel of ¼" recording tape, typical of audiophile, consumer and educational use in the 1950s–60s]]

Engineers at [[AEG]], working with the chemical giant [[IG Farben]], created the world's first practical magnetic tape recorder, the 'K1', which was first demonstrated in 1935. During [[World War II]], an engineer at the [[Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft]] discovered the [[Tape bias|AC biasing]] technique. With this technique, an inaudible high-frequency signal, typically in the range of 50 to 150&amp;nbsp;kHz, is added to the audio signal before being applied to the recording head. Biasing radically improved the sound quality of magnetic tape recordings. By 1943 AEG had developed stereo tape recorders.

During the war, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] became aware of radio broadcasts that seemed to be transcriptions (much of this due to the work of [[Richard H. Ranger]]), but their audio quality was indistinguishable from that of a live broadcast and their duration was far longer than was possible with 78 rpm discs. At the end of the war, the Allies captured a number of German [[Magnetophon]] recorders from Radio Luxembourg that aroused great interest. These recorders incorporated all of the key technological features of analogue magnetic recording, particularly the use of high-frequency bias.

Development of magnetic tape recorders in the late 1940s and early 1950s is associated with the [[Brush Development Company]] and its licensee, [[Ampex]]; the equally important development of magnetic tape media itself was led by [[Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing]] corporation (now known as 3M).

American audio engineer [[John T. Mullin]] and entertainer [[Bing Crosby]] were key players in the commercial development of magnetic tape. Mullin served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps and was posted to Paris in the final months of World War II; his unit was assigned to find out everything they could about German radio and electronics, including the investigation of claims that the Germans had been experimenting with high-energy directed radio beams as a means of disabling the electrical systems of aircraft. Mullin's unit soon amassed a collection of hundreds of low-quality magnetic dictating machines, but it was a chance visit to a studio at [[Bad Neuheim]] near [[Frankfurt]] while investigating radio beam rumours that yielded the real prize.

Mullin was given two suitcase-sized AEG 'Magnetophon' high-fidelity recorders and fifty reels of recording tape. He had them shipped home and over the next two years he worked on the machines constantly, modifying them and improving their performance. His major aim was to interest Hollywood studios in using magnetic tape for movie soundtrack recording.

Mullin gave two public demonstrations of his machines, and they caused a sensation among American audio professionals—many listeners  could not believe that what they were hearing was not a live performance. By luck, Mullin's second demonstration was held at [[MGM]] studios in [[Hollywood]] and in the audience that day was [[Bing Crosby|Bing Crosby's]] technical director, Murdo Mackenzie. He arranged for Mullin to meet Crosby and in June 1947 he gave Crosby a private demonstration of his magnetic tape recorders.

Crosby was stunned by the amazing sound quality and instantly saw the huge commercial potential of the new machines. Live music was the standard for American radio at the time and the major [[radio network]]s did not permit the use of disc recording in many programs because of their comparatively poor sound quality. But Crosby disliked the regimentation of live broadcasts, preferring the relaxed atmosphere of the [[recording studio]]. He had asked [[NBC]] to let him pre-record his 1944–45 series on [[transcription disc]]s, but the network refused, so Crosby had withdrawn from live radio for a year, returning for the 1946–47 season only reluctantly.

Mullin's tape recorder came along at precisely the right moment. Crosby realized that the new technology would enable him to pre-record his radio show with a sound quality that equaled live broadcasts, and that these tapes could be replayed many times with no appreciable loss of quality. Mullin was asked to tape one show as a test and was immediately hired as Crosby's chief engineer to pre-record the rest of the series.

Crosby became the first major American music star to use tape to pre-record radio broadcasts, and the first to master commercial recordings on tape. The taped Crosby radio shows were painstakingly edited through tape-splicing to give them a pace and flow that was wholly unprecedented in radio. Mullin even claims to have been the first to use "[[canned laughter]]"; at the insistence of Crosby's head writer, Bill Morrow, he inserted a segment of raucous laughter from an earlier show into a joke in a later show that had not worked well.

Keen to make use of the new recorders as soon as possible, Crosby invested $50,000 of his own money into [[Ampex]], and the tiny six-man concern soon became the world leader in the development of tape recording, revolutionizing radio and recording with its famous Ampex Model 200 tape deck, issued in 1948 and developed directly from Mullin's modified Magnetophones.

===Multitrack recording===
{{Main|Multitrack recording}}

The next major development in magnetic tape was [[multitrack recording]], in which the tape is divided into multiple tracks parallel with each other. Because they are carried on the same medium, the tracks stay in perfect synchronization. The first development in multitracking was [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] sound, which divided the recording head into two tracks. First developed by German audio engineers ca. 1943, 2-track recording was rapidly adopted for modern music in the 1950s because it enabled signals from two or more separate microphones to be recorded simultaneously, enabling stereophonic recordings to be made and edited conveniently. (The first stereo recordings, on disks, had been made in the 1930s, but were never issued commercially.) Stereo (either true, two-microphone stereo or multimixed) quickly became the norm for commercial classical recordings and radio broadcasts, although many [[pop music]] and [[jazz]] recordings continued to be issued in [[Monaural|monophonic]] sound until the mid-1960s.

Much of the credit for the development of multitrack recording goes to guitarist, composer and technician [[Les Paul]], who also helped design the famous [[electric guitar]] that [[Gibson Les Paul|bears his name]]. His experiments with tapes and recorders in the early 1950s led him to order the first custom-built eight-track recorder from Ampex, and his pioneering recordings with his then wife, singer [[Mary Ford]], were the first to make use of the technique of multitracking to record separate elements of a musical piece asynchronously&amp;nbsp;— that is, separate elements could be recorded at different times. Paul's technique enabled him to listen to the tracks he had already taped and record new parts in time alongside them.

Multitrack recording was immediately taken up in a limited way by Ampex, who soon produced a commercial 3-track recorder. These proved extremely useful for popular music, since they enabled backing music to be recorded on two tracks (either to allow the overdubbing of separate parts, or to create a full stereo backing track) while the third track was reserved for the lead vocalist. Three-track recorders remained in widespread commercial use until the mid-1960s and many famous pop recordings&amp;nbsp;— including many of [[Phil Spector]]'s so-called "[[Wall of Sound]]" productions and early [[Motown]] hits&amp;nbsp;— were taped on Ampex 3-track recorders. Engineer [[Tom Dowd]] was among the first to use multitrack recording for popular music production while working for [[Atlantic Records]] during the 1950s.

The next important development was 4-track recording. The advent of this improved system gave recording engineers and musicians vastly greater flexibility for recording and overdubbing, and 4-track was the studio standard for most of the later 1960s. Many of the most famous recordings by [[The Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]] were recorded on 4-track, and the engineers at London's [[Abbey Road Studios]] became particularly adept at a technique called "reduction mixes" in the UK and "bouncing down" in the United States, in which several tracks were recorded onto one 4-track machine and then mixed together and transferred (bounced down) to one track of a second 4-track machine. In this way, it was possible to record literally dozens of separate tracks and combine them into finished recordings of great complexity.

All of the Beatles classic mid-1960s recordings, including the albums ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', were recorded in this way. There were limitations, however, because of the build-up of noise during the bouncing-down process, and the Abbey Road engineers are still famed for their ability to create dense multitrack recordings while keeping background noise to a minimum.

4-track tape also enabled the development of [[quadraphonic]] sound, in which each of the four tracks was used to simulate a complete 360-degree surround sound. A number of albums were released both in stereo and quadrophonic format in the 1970s, but 'quad' failed to gain wide commercial acceptance. Although it is now considered a gimmick, it was the direct precursor of the surround sound technology that has become standard in many modern [[home cinema|home theatre]] systems.

In a professional setting today, such as a studio, [[audio engineer]]s may use 24 tracks or more for their recordings, using one or more tracks for each instrument played.

The combination of the ability to edit via tape splicing and the ability to record multiple tracks revolutionized studio recording. It became common studio recording practice to record on multiple tracks, and bounce down afterward. The convenience of tape editing and multitrack recording led to the rapid adoption of magnetic tape as the primary technology for commercial musical recordings. Although 33⅓ rpm and 45 rpm [[vinyl record]]s were the dominant consumer format, recordings were customarily made first on tape, then transferred to disc, with Bing Crosby leading the way in the adoption of this method in the United States.

===Further developments===
Analog magnetic tape recording introduces noise, usually called "[[tape hiss]]", caused by the finite size of the magnetic particles in the tape. There is a direct tradeoff between noise and economics. [[Signal-to-noise ratio]] is increased at higher speeds and with wider tracks, and decreased at lower speeds and with narrower tracks.

By the late 1960s, disk reproducing equipment became so good that audiophiles soon became aware that some of the noise audible on recordings was not surface noise or deficiencies in their equipment, but reproduced tape hiss. A few specialist companies started making "[[direct to disc recording]]s", made by feeding microphone signals directly to a disk cutter (after amplification and mixing), in essence reverting to the pre-War direct method of recording. These recordings never became popular, but they dramatically demonstrated the magnitude and importance of the tape hiss problem.

[[File:Kaseta magnetofonowa ubt.jpeg|thumb|200px|audio cassette]]
Before 1963, when [[Philips]] introduced the [[Compact audio cassette]], almost all tape recording had used the [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] (also called "open reel") format. Previous attempts to package the tape in a convenient cassette that required no threading met with limited success; the most successful was [[8-track cartridge]] used primarily in automobiles for playback only. The Philips Compact audio cassette added much needed convenience to the tape recording format and a decade or so later had begun to dominate the consumer market, although it was to remain lower in quality than open reel formats.

In the 1970s, advances in solid-state electronics made the design and marketing of more sophisticated analog circuitry economically feasible. This led to a number of attempts to reduce tape hiss through the use of various forms of volume compression and expansion, the most notable and commercially successful being several systems developed by [[Dolby Laboratories]]. These systems divided the frequency spectrum into several bands and applied volume [[Dynamic range compression|compression]]/expansion independently to each band (Engineers now often use the term "compansion" to refer to this process). The Dolby systems were very successful at increasing the effective dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio of analog audio recording; to all intents and purposes, audible tape hiss could be eliminated. The original [[Dolby noise reduction system|Dolby A]] was only used in professional recording. Successors found use in both professional and consumer formats; [[Dolby B]] became almost universal for prerecorded music on cassette. Subsequent forms, including [[Dolby C]], (and the short-lived [[Dolby S]]) were developed for home use.

In the 1980s, [[digital recording]] methods were introduced, and analog tape recording was gradually displaced, although it has not disappeared by any means. (Many professional studios, particularly those catering to big-budget clients, use analog recorders for multitracking and/or mixdown.) Digital audio tape never became important as a consumer recording medium partially due to legal complications arising from "[[Copyright infringement#Terminology|piracy]]" fears on the part of the record companies. They had opposed magnetic tape recording when it first became available to consumers, but the technical difficulty of juggling recording levels, overload distortion, and residual tape hiss was sufficiently high that unlicensed reproduction of magnetic tape never became an insurmountable commercial problem. With digital methods, copies of recordings could be exact, and copyright infringement might have become a serious commercial problem. Digital tape is still used in professional situations and the [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]] variant has found a home in computer data backup applications. Many professional and home recordists now use hard-disk-based systems for recording, burning the final mixes to recordable [[CD]]s (CD-R's).

Most Police horses in the United Kingdom (and elsewhere) still use analogue compact cassette systems to record Police Interviews as it provides a medium less prone to accusations of tampering.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Recording on film==
The first attempts to record sound to an optical medium occurred around 1900. Prior to the use of recorded sound in film, theaters would have live orchestras present during silent films. The musicians would sit in the pit below the screen and would provide the background noise and set the mood for whatever was occurring in the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wonderstruckthebook.com/essay_silent-to-sound.htm|title=Wonderstruck {{!}} Essays|website=www.wonderstruckthebook.com|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, [[Eugene Augustin Lauste]] applied for a patent to record [[Sound-on-film]], but was ahead of his time. In 1923, [[Lee de Forest]] applied for a patent to record to film; he also made a number of short experimental films, mostly of [[vaudeville]] performers. [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] began releasing sound-on-film newsreels in 1926, the same year that [[Warner Bros.]] released ''[[Don Juan]]'' with music and [[sound effects]] recorded on discs, as well as a series of short films with fully-[[synchronized sound]] on discs. In 1927, the sound film ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' was released; while not the first sound film, it made a tremendous hit and made the public and the film industry realize that sound film was more than a mere novelty.

''The Jazz Singer'' used a process called [[Vitaphone]] that involved synchronizing the projected film to sound recorded on disc. It essentially amounted to playing a phonograph record, but one that was recorded with the best electrical technology of the time. Audiences used to acoustic phonographs and recordings would, in the theatre, have heard something resembling 1950s "[[high fidelity]]".

However, in the days of analog technology, no process involving a separate disk could hold synchronization precisely or reliably. Vitaphone was quickly supplanted by technologies which recorded an optical [[soundtrack]] directly onto the side of the strip of motion picture [[film]]. This was the dominant technology from the 1930s through the 1960s and is still in use {{As of|2013|lc=on}} although the analog soundtrack is being replaced by [[sound-on-film|digital sound on film formats]].

There are two types of synchronised film soundtrack, optical and magnetic. Optical sound tracks are visual renditions of [[sound wave]] forms and provide sound through a light beam and optical sensor within the projector. Magnetic sound tracks are essentially the same as used in conventional analog tape recording.

Magnetic soundtracks can be joined with the moving image but it creates an abrupt discontinuity because of the offset of the audio track relative to the picture. Whether optical or magnetic, the audio pickup must be located several inches ahead of the projection lamp, [[Movie projector shutter|shutter]] and drive [[sprocket]]s. There is usually a [[flywheel]] as well to smooth out the film motion to eliminate the flutter that would otherwise result from the [[negative pulldown]] mechanism. If you have films with a magnetic track, you should keep them away from strong magnetic sources, such as televisions. These can weaken or wipe the magnetic sound signal. Magnetic sound on a [[cellulose acetate film]] base is also more prone to [[vinegar syndrome]] than a film with just the image.{{why?|date=April 2016}}{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[File:Optical-film-soundtrack.svg|thumb|150px|right|A variable density soundtrack (left)and a bi-lateral variable area soundtrack (right)]]
For optical recording on film there are two methods utilized. Variable density recording uses changes in the darkness of the soundtrack side of the film to represent the soundwave. Variable area recording uses changes in the width of a dark strip to represent the soundwave.

In both cases, light that is sent through the part of the film that corresponds to the soundtrack changes in intensity, proportional to the original sound, and that light is not projected on the screen but converted into an electrical signal by a light sensitive device.

Optical soundtracks are prone to the same sorts of degradation that affect the picture, such as scratching and copying.

Unlike the film image that creates the illusion of continuity, soundtracks are continuous. This means that if film with a combined soundtrack is cut and spliced, the image will cut cleanly but the sound track will most likely produce a cracking sound. Fingerprints on the film may also produce cracking or interference.

In the late 1950s, the cinema industry, desperate to provide a theatre experience that would be overwhelmingly superior to television, introduced [[widescreen#film|widescreen]] processes such as [[Cinerama]], [[Todd-AO]] and [[CinemaScope]]. These processes at the same time introduced technical improvements in sound, generally involving the use of multitrack ''magnetic sound'', recorded on an oxide stripe laminated onto the film. In subsequent decades, a gradual evolution occurred with more and more theatres installing various forms of magnetic-sound equipment.

In the 1990s, [[digital electronics|digital]] audio systems were introduced and began to prevail. In some of them the sound recording is again recorded on a separate disk, as in Vitaphone; others use a digital, [[optical sound]] track on the film itself. Digital processes can now achieve reliable and perfect synchronization.

==Digital recording==
[[File:Dat cartridge.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The DAT or Digital Audio Tape]]The first [[digital audio]] recorders were reel-to-reel decks introduced by companies such as Denon (1972), Soundstream (1979) and Mitsubishi. They used a digital technology known as [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] recording. Within a few years, however, many studios were using devices that encoded the digital audio data into a standard video signal, which was then recorded on a [[U-matic]] or other videotape recorder, using the rotating-head technology that was standard for video. A similar technology was used for a consumer format, [[Digital Audio Tape]] (DAT) which used rotating heads on a narrow tape contained in a cassette. DAT records at sampling rates of 48&amp;nbsp;kHz or 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz, the latter being the same rate used on compact discs. Bit depth is 16 bits, also the same as compact discs. DAT was a failure in the consumer-audio field (too expensive, too finicky, and crippled by anti-copying regulations), but it became popular in studios (particularly home studios) and radio stations. A failed digital tape recording system was the [[Digital Compact Cassette]] (DCC).

Within a few years after the introduction of digital recording, multitrack recorders (using stationary heads) were being produced for use in professional studios. In the early 1990s, relatively low-priced multitrack digital recorders were introduced for use in home studios; they returned to recording on videotape. The most notable of this type of recorder is the [[ADAT]]. Developed by [[Alesis]] and first released in 1991, the ADAT machine is capable of recording 8 tracks of digital audio onto a single [[S-VHS]] video cassette. The ADAT machine is still a very common fixture in professional and home studios around the world.

In the consumer market, tapes and gramophones were largely displaced by the [[compact disc]] (CD) and a lesser extent the [[minidisc]]. These recording media are fully digital and require complex electronics to play back.

[[File:Interference-colors.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Interference colours on a compact disc.]]

Digital sound [[Computer file|files]] can be stored on any [[computer storage]] medium. The development of the [[MP3]] audio file format, and legal issues involved in copying such files, has driven most of the innovation in music distribution since their introduction in the late 1990s.

As [[hard disk]] capacities and computer [[CPU speed]]s increased at the end of the 1990s, [[hard disk recorder|hard disk recording]] became more popular. As of early 2005 hard disk recording takes two forms. One is the use of standard desktop or laptop computers, with adapters for encoding audio into two or many tracks of digital audio. These adapters can either be in-the-box soundcards or external devices, either connecting to in-box interface cards or connecting to the computer via USB or Firewire cables. The other common form of hard disk recording uses a dedicated recorder which contains analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters as well as one or two removable hard drives for data storage. Such recorders, packing 24 tracks in a few units of rack space, are actually single-purpose computers, which can in turn be connected to standard computers for editing.

== The revival of vinyl ==
Vinyl records, or long playing (LP) records, have become popular again as a way to consume music despite the rise of digital media. Over 15 million units were sold between 2008 and 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartmanski|first=Dominik|last2=Woodward|first2=Ian|date=2015-03-01|title=The vinyl: The analogue medium in the age of digital reproduction|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1469540513488403|journal=Journal of Consumer Culture|volume=15|issue=1|pages=3–27|doi=10.1177/1469540513488403|issn=1469-5405}}&lt;/ref&gt;, their sales reaching the highest level in 2012 since 1993. Popular artists have begun releasing their albums on vinyl, and stores such as Urban Outfitters and Whole Foods have started selling them. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/04/16/vinyl-sales-record-store-day/|title=Vinyl Sales Are Not Just a Hipster Thing Anymore|work=Fortune|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular music corporations, such as Sony, have started manufacturing LP for the first time since 1989 as this medium becomes more popular. However, some companies are facing production problems as there are only 16 record plants currently functioning in the United States. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/04/17/400364697/solving-the-vinyl-comebacks-big-problem-one-antique-machine-at-a-time|title=Solving The Vinyl Comeback's Big Problem, One Antique Machine At A Time|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''
==Technique==
The analog [[tape recorder]] made it possible to erase or record over a previous recording so that mistakes could be fixed. Another advantage of recording on tape is the ability to cut the tape and join it back together. This allows the recording to be edited. Pieces of the recording can be removed, or rearranged. See also [[audio engineering|audio editing]], [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]], [[multitrack recording]].

&lt;!-- Mention [[multitrack recording]] here. --&gt;
The advent of [[electronic instrument]]s (especially [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and [[synthesizer]]s), effects and other instruments has led to the importance of [[MIDI]] in recording. For example, using [[MIDI timecode]], it is possible to have different equipment 'trigger' without direct human intervention at the time of recording.

In more recent times, computers ([[digital audio workstation]]s) have found an increasing role in the [[recording studio]], as their use eases the tasks of [[cutting]] and [[loop (music)|looping]], as well as allowing for instantaneous changes, such as duplication of parts, the addition of effects and the rearranging of parts of the recording.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4972">'''IP-XACT''' is an [[XML]] format that defines and describes individual, re-usable [[circuit design|electronic circuit design]]s (individual pieces of intellectual property, or IPs) to facilitate their use in creating [[integrated circuits]] (i.e. ''microchips''). IP-XACT was created by the [[SPIRIT Consortium]] as a standard to enable automated configuration and integration through tools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://accellera.org/activities/working-groups/ip-xact/ IP-XACT Working Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of the standard are
* to ensure delivery of compatible component descriptions from multiple component vendors,
* to enable exchanging complex component libraries between [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) tools for [[System-on-a-chip|SoC]] design (design environments),
* to describe configurable components using [[metadata]], and
* to enable the provision of EDA vendor-neutral scripts for component creation and configuration (generators, configurators).

Approved as [[IEEE]] 1685-2009 on December 9, 2009, published on February 18, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE 1685-2009, {{ISBN|978-0-7381-6160-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Superseded by [[IEEE]] 1685-2014. IEEE 1685-2009 was adopted as IEC 62014-4:2015.

== Overview ==

All documents will have the following basic titular attributes spirit:vendor, spirit:library, spirit:name, spirit:version.

A document typically represents one of:
* bus specification, giving its signals and protocol etc.;
* leaf IP block data sheet;
* or a hierarchic component wiring diagram that describes a sub-system by connecting up or abstracting other components made up of spirit:componentInstance and spirit:interconnection elements.

For each port of a component there will be a spirit:busInterface element in the document.  This may have a spirit:signalMap
that gives the mapping of the formal net names in the interface to the names used in a corresponding formal specification of the port.
A simple wiring tool will use the signal map to know which net on one interface to connect to which net on another instance
of the same formal port on another component.

There may be various versions of a component referenced in the document, each as a spirit:view element, relating to different versions of a design: typical levels are gate-level, RTL and TLM.
Each view typically contains a list of filenames as a spirit:fileSet that implement the design at that level of abstraction in appropriate language, like Verilog,
C++ or PSL.

Non-functional data present includes the programmer's view with a list of spirit:register declarations inside a spirit:memoryMap or spirit:addressBlock.

'''ICRA, the International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics''' is an international research institute for relativistic astrophysics and related areas. Its members are seven Universities and four organizations. The center is located in Rome, Italy.

The International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics (ICRA) was founded in 1985 by [[Remo Ruffini]] ([[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome "La Sapienza"]]) together with [[Riccardo Giacconi]] ([[Nobel Prize]] for Physics 2002), [[Abdus Salam]] (Nobel Prize for Physics 1979), Paul Boynton ([[University of Washington]]), [[George Coyne]] (former director of the [[Vatican Observatory|Vatican observatory]]), [[Francis Everitt]] ([[Stanford University]]), [[Fang Lizhi|Fang Li-Zhi]] ([[University of Science and Technology of China]]). It became a legal entity in 1991 with the Ministerial Decree 22/11/1991 from the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/atto/serie_generale/caricaDettaglioAtto/originario;jsessionid=-VZ1tD6Z2fXF3PMUAI5TAw__.ntc-as4-guri2b?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=1992-08-31&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=092A4013&amp;elenco30giorni=false|title=Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica Italiana n. 204 del 31/8/1992|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Center of Relativistic Astrophysics is located in the Department of Physics building at the main Campus of the University of Rome "Sapienza".

In 2005 ICRA has been among the founders of [[ICRANet]], the International Center for Relativistic Astrophysics Network. The national activities of research and teaching in Italy remained operative at ICRA in Rome, while international activities and coordination are now based in ICRANet in Pescara.

==Other activities==

===Meetings initiated by ICRA===
'''Marcel Grossmann meetings'''

Writing down the equations of General Relativity was no doubt the result of Einstein's brilliant physical intuition, based from the mathematical point of view on the work of Gregorio Ricci Curbastro and Tullio Levi Civita of the University of Padua and the University of Rome "La Sapienza". Essential to this work was the intervention of Marcel Grossmann of the University of Zurich who was close to Einstein and who had a deep knowledge of the Italian school of geometry.
In order to promote this important collaboration between physics and mathematics, in celebration of that historic event, Remo Ruffini and Abdus Salam established in 1975 the Marcel Grossmann meetings (MG) on Recent Developments in Theoretical and Experimental General Relativity, Gravitation, and Relativistic Field Theories which take place every three years in different countries. MG1 and MG2 were held in 1975 and in 1979 in Trieste; MG3 in 1982 in Shanghai; MG4 in 1985 in Rome; MG5 in 1988 in Perth; MG6 in 1991 in Kyoto; MG7 in 1994 at Stanford; MG8 in 1997 in Jerusalem; MG9 in 2000 in Rome; MG10 in 2003 in Rio de Janeiro; MG11 in 2006 in Berlin; MG12 in 2009 in Paris; MG13 in 2012 in Stockholm; MG14 in 2015 in Rome.

'''Italian-Korean Meetings on Relativistic Astrophysics'''

The Italian-Korean Symposia on Relativistic Astrophysics is a series of biannual meetings organized alternatively in Italy and in Korea since 1987. It has been boosting exchange of information and collaborations between Italian and Korean astrophysicists on new and hot issues in the field of Relativistic Astrophysics. The symposia cover topics in astrophysics and cosmology, such as gamma ray bursts and compact stars, high energy cosmic rays, dark energy and dark matter, general relativity, black holes, and new physics related to cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icranet.org/images/stories/Meetings/IK13/Korea.pdf|title=Italian-Korean Meetings|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Fairbank Meetings on Relativistic Gravitational Experiments in Space'''

The First William Fairbank Meeting on was held at the University of Rome "La Sapienza," in 1990, under the auspices of ICRA with support from ASI (Italian Space Agency), ESA (European Space Agency), the Vatican Observatory, Stanford University and the University of Rome. Almost 80 physicists and engineers in widely diversified fields relativistic gravitation, space research, SQUID technology, large scale cryogenics, clock technology, laser and radar science and other fields - came together in the kinds of free technical exchange so characteristic of William Fairbank, in whose honor the meeting was held. The second meeting was held in Hong Kong and was devoted to relativistic gravitational experiments in space. The third meeting held in Rome and Pescara in 1998 was focused on the Lense-Thirring effect.

First William Fairbank Meeting, Rome, 10–14 September 1990, ICRA, University of Rome "La Sapienza" - ICRA Network, Pescara.

Second William Fairbank Meeting, December 13–16, 1993, Hong Kong

Third William Fairbank Meeting. The Lense-Thirring Effect, June 29 - July 4, 1998, ICRA, University of Rome "La Sapienza" - ICRA Network, Pescara.

'''The Galileo-Xu Guangqi meetings'''

The Galileo-Xu Guangqi meetings&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icranet.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=400&amp;Itemid=802|title=Galileo-Xu Guangqi meetings|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been created in the name of Galileo and Xu Guangqi, the collaborator of Matteo Ricci (Ri Ma Dou), generally recognized for bringing to China the works of Euclid and Galileo and for his strong commitment to the process of modernization and scientific development of China. The 1st Galileo - Xu Guangqi Meeting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icranet.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=442&amp;Itemid=686|title=1st Galileo - Xu Guangqi Meeting|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held in Shanghai, China in 2009. The 2nd Galileo - Xu Guangqi meeting took place in Hanbury Botanic Gardens (Ventimiglia, Italy) and Villa Ratti (Nice, France) in 2010. The 3rd and 4th Galileo - Xu Guangqi meetings were held in Beijing, China in 2011 and 2015, respectively.

Information about the physiological state of an organism can also be revealed indirectly through its ionome, for example [[iron deficiency]] in a plant can be identified by looking at a number of other [[chemical elements|elements]], rather than [[iron]] itself.&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;Baxter, I (2009) Ionomics: studying the social network of mineral nutrients.Curr Opin Plant Biol;12(3):381-6.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2701637/]&lt;/ref&gt; A more typical example is in a blood test, where a number of conditions involving nutrition or [[disease]] may be inferred from testing this single [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] for [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[iron]], [[chlorine]], [[zinc]], [[magnesium]], [[calcium]] and [[copper]].&lt;ref&gt;Brody, Tom.

In practice, the total elemental composition of an organism is rarely determined. The number and type of elements measured are limited by the available instrumentation, the assumed value of the element in question, and the added cost of measuring each additional element. Also, a single tissue may be measured instead of the entire organism, as in the example given above of a [[blood test]], or in the case of [[plants]], the sampling of just the leaves or seeds. These are simply issues of practicality.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; 
 
Various techniques may be fruitfully used to measure elemental composition. Among the best are Inductively-Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES), Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), synchrotron-based microXRF,&lt;ref&gt;Young LW, Westcott ND, Attenkofer K, Reaney MJ (2006).

'''Irish Fiscal Advisory Council''' ('''IFAC'''; {{lang-ga|Comhairle Chomhairleach Bhuiséadach na hÉireann}}) is a non-department statutory body providing independent assessment and analysis of the Irish Government's economic and budgetary forecasts, and fiscal approach.  IFAC monitors compliance with EU fiscal rules and agreements.  IFAC was created to counter the "[[green jersey agenda]]" which was identified as a contributor to the Irish financial crisis.

==Purpose==
{{see also|Put on the green jersey}}
IFAC was formed as part of a program of reform of Ireland’s "budgetary architecture" post the Irish economic crisis.  It was established on an interim basis in July 2011, and legally constituted under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/FRA.pdf|title=Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 | publisher=Department of Finance | date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was part of the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland (and whose terms required the creation of a "budgetary advisory council to provide an independent assessment of Government forecasts").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/ireland-business-blog-with-lisa-ocarroll/2010/nov/28/ireland-bailout-full-government-statement|title=Ireland bailout: full Irish government statement|publisher=The Guardian|date=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IFAC_DoF_Forecasting_MoU_2018_Signed.pdf|title=Memorandum of Understanding between the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Department of Finance relating to the “Endorsement Function” of the Council under the Fiscal Responsibility Acts 2012 and 2013|publisher=IFAC Department of Finance|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The formation of IFAC was a response to the perceived failure of established Irish economic and Irish regulatory institutions to anticipate and warn over the consequences of the Irish credit bubble (i.e. the so-called "[[put on the green jersey|green jersey agenda"]]), and/or engage in the concerns that were being raised by various international monitors at the time (IMF and OECD) regarding Ireland's economic situation.&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/failure-to-heed-warnings-was-cause-of-crash-trichet-30949719.html|title=Failure to heed warnings was cause of crash: Trichet | publisher=Irish Independent | date=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/banking-inquiry/fitzgerald-my-regrets-over-crash-are-with-me-until-i-die-30985532.html|title=FitzGerald: My regrets over crash are with me until I die|publisher=Irish Independent|date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFAC performs a similar role to the "[[Office for Budget Responsibility]]" in the United Kingdom (also formed after the financial crisis), and other equivalent members of the "[[EU Independent Fiscal Institutions Network|Network of European Union Independent Fiscal Institutions]]" (which IFAC joined in September 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/what-is-the-irish-fiscal-advisory-council-for-31277271.html|title=What is the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council for? | publisher=Irish Independent | date=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/john-mchale-the-man-whose-job-it-is-to-say-no-minister-30087657.html|title=John McHale The man whose job it is to say 'No Minister' | publisher=Irish Independent | date=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFAC is structured as a Council of 5 members (one Chairperson) and a supporting analytical team of circa 6.&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/gov/budgeting/Ireland.pdf|title=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council| publisher=OECD Journal on Budgeting | date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://audgen.gov.ie/documents/annualreports/2015/report/en/Chapter18.pdf|title=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council| publisher=C&amp;AG Report 2015 | date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal mandate of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (per IFAC website) is to:
* Assess and endorse the Irish Government’s official macroeconomic forecasts.
* Assess the Irish Government's budgetary forecasts.
* Assess the broader fiscal stance of the Irish Government.
* Monitor compliance with legislated fiscal rules by the Irish Government.

IFAC has been well received by Irish financial commentators and its publications are widely covered in the Irish media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/editorial/fiscal-advisory-council-s-timely-warning-1.3211833?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fopinion%2Feditorial%2Ffiscal-advisory-council-s-timely-warning-1.3211833|title=Fiscal Advisory Council’s timely warning|publisher=Irish Times|date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/fiscal-council-budget-2018-3581853-Sep2017/|title=Fiscal Council says Ireland is still vulnerable and warns against extra Budget spending|publisher=thejournal.ie|date=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/chairman-fiscal-advisory-council-theres-been-a-very-strong-recovery-we-are-now-living-within-our-means-36500320.html|title=Chairman, Fiscal Advisory Council: 'There's been a very strong recovery - we are now living within our means'|publisher=thejournal.ie|date=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesspost.ie/opinion/jack-horgan-jones-mchales-advice-ignored-ifac-not-afraid-bare-teeth-371851|title=Even if the government refuses listen, having this kind of analysis in the public domain is vital|publisher=Sunday Business Post|date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/70b38194-f568-11e3-91a8-00144feabdc0|title=Ireland needs continued austerity says watchdog|publisher=Financial Times|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

The key mandated publications of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council are:
* Bi-annual Fiscal Assessment Report (FAR) (produced after the Irish autumn Budget, and the spring Stability Update).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/fiscal-assessment-reports/|title=Fiscal Assessment Reports|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bi-annual Endorsement Letters of macroeconomic forecasts (produced in advance of the Irish autumn Budget, and the spring Stability Update).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/endorsement-letters/|title=Endorsement Letters|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Annual Pre-Budget Statement (produced before the Irish autumn Budget).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/pre-budget-statements/|title=Pre-Budget Statements|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Annual Ex-Post Assessment of Compliance with the Domestic Budgetary Rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/ex-post-assessments-of-compliance-with-the-domestic-budgetary-rule/|title=Assessments of Compliance with the Domestic Budgetary Rule|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has commenced an annual conference titled “Path for the Public Finances” that was started in March 2017. The goal is to bring attention to long-term Irish State finance issues relevant for Ireland. International speakers attend.  Each annual event is intended to focus on a particular theme, which has been:
* March 2017 Path for the Public Finances: Fiscal Risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/path-for-the-public-finances-2017-fiscal-risks/|title=Path for the Public Finances 2017 Fiscal Risks|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* March 2018 Path for the Public Finances: Too Hot, Too Cold! The Irish Cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/ifac-conference/path-for-the-public-finances-2018-too-hot-too-cold-the-irish-cycle/|title=Path for the Public Finances 2018 Too Hot Too Cold The Irish Cycle|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFAC also publishes Analytical Notes and Working Papers in areas of concern to Irish financial stability (including House Prices, Tax Receipts, Public Debt, and EU Rules/Guidelines).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/analytical-notes/|title=IFAC Analytical Notes Series|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus==

The IFAC looks at major areas that could affect the stability and confidence levels of Irish macroeconomic forecasts, and/or, create the potential for economic shocks.

===Distortion of Irish GDP and GNP===
{{see also|Corporate haven#Distorted GDP/GNP|Corporate haven#GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy}}
{{see also|Modified gross national income}}

Ireland is a leading [[corporate tax haven]] (see [[Corporate haven#Corporate tax haven lists|Corporate tax haven lists]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/ireland-is-the-world-s-biggest-corporate-tax-haven-say-academics-1.3528401?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fireland-is-the-world-s-biggest-corporate-tax-haven-say-academics-1.3528401|title=Ireland is the world’s biggest corporate ‘tax haven’, say academics|quote=Study claims State shelters more multinational profits than the entire Caribbean|publisher=Irish Times|date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Extreme distortions of national economic data is a well-known feature of [[corporate tax haven]]s.&lt;ref name="qqtz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1300880/tax-havens-mean-40-of-foreign-direct-investments-are-artificial/|title=How tax havens turn economic statistics into nonsense|publisher=Quartz|date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imfx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2018/06/inside-the-world-of-global-tax-havens-and-offshore-banking/damgaard.htm|title=Piercing the Veil, FINANCE &amp; DEVELOPMENT, JUNE 2018, VOL. 55, NO. 2 |publisher=IMF Finance &amp; Development|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The top 15 GDP-per-capita countries are heavily represented by traditional and corporate tax havens (see [[Corporate haven#GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy|GDP-per-capita and tax havens]]).  The artificial nature of the distortion makes the haven prone to more severe credit cycles as international capital markets misprice the cost of credit to the tax haven in benign times, only to reverse it sharply in  times of global stress (see [[Corporate haven#Distorted GDP/GNP|tax haven cycles]]).  

{{quote|A stunning $12 trillion—almost 40 percent of all foreign direct investment positions globally—is completely artificial: it consists of financial investment passing through empty corporate shells with no real activity. These investments in empty corporate shells almost always pass through well-known tax havens.

IFAC was one of the members of the economic steering group ((the Economic Statistics Review Group, or "ESRG"), that [[Philip R. Lane]], the Governor of the [[Central Bank of Ireland]], convened to create a new economic statistic to replace Irish GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/newsevents/documents/reportoftheeconomicstatisticsreviewgroup/ESRG_Presentation_-_Press_Briefing.pdf|title=ESRG Presentation and CSO Response|publisher=Central Statistics Office|date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/analysis-and-comment/2017/0204/850115-leprechaun-economics/|title=Leprechaun-proofing economic data|publisher=RTE News|date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metric, also called GNI*, is circa 30% below Irish GDP.&lt;ref name="gni1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/cso-paints-a-very-different-picture-of-irish-economy-with-new-measure-1.3155462|title=CSO paints a very different picture of Irish economy with new measure|publisher=Irish Times|date=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gni2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/new-economic-leprechaun-on-loose-as-rate-of-growth-plunges-35932663.html|title=New economic Leprechaun on loose as rate of growth plunges|publisher=Irish Independent|date=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish Public Debt===
{{see also|Leprechaun economics}}
{{see also|Modified gross national income}}

Ireland's economic data is distorted by the tax planning schemes of US multinationals based in Ireland (i.e. "[[double Irish]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/europe-points-finger-at-ireland-over-tax-avoidance-1.3417948|title=Europe points finger at Ireland over tax avoidance|publisher=Irish Times|date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While traditionally this distortion manifested itself in divergences between Ireland's GDP and GNI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economic-incentives.blogspot.ie/2013/04/gdp-and-international-comparisons.html|title=International GNI to GDP Comparisons|publisher=Seamus Coffey, University College Cork|date=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as the schemes have become more developed (i.e. "[[double Irish|capital allowances for intangibles]]"), Irish GNI and GNP have also become materially distorted.  This was most evident in the "[[leprechaun economics]]" affair when Apple restructured its controversial Irish operations (the subject of the EU Commission's €13bn fine) in January 2015 and Irish GDP rose 26.3% while Irish GNP rose 18.7%.

The problem of assessing Ireland's public indebtedness post "[[leprechaun economics]]" and "[[Modified gross national income|modified GNI]]", is captured on page 34 of the OECD 2018 Ireland Survey:&lt;ref name="oecd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/OECD-survey.pdf|title=OECD Ireland Survey 2018|publisher=OECD|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On a Gross Public Debt-to-GDP basis, Ireland's 2015 figure at 78.8% is not of concern.
* On a Gross Public Debt-to-GNI* basis, Ireland's 2015 figure at 116.5% is more serious, but not alarming.
* On a Gross Public Debt Per Capita basis, Ireland's 2015 figure at over $62,686 per capita, exceeds every other OECD country, except Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/national-debt-now-44000-per-head-35904197.html|title=National debt now €44000 per head|publisher=Irish Independent|date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFAC introduced a new measure of benchmarking Irish public debt by comparing to Tax Revenues (similar to the Debt-to-EBITDA ratio used in capital markets).  On this basis, Ireland's 2016 Gross Public Debt-to-Tax Revenues is 282.9%, which is the 4th highest of the EU-28 (after Greece, Portugal, and Cyprus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Fiscal-Assessment-Report-June-2017-Presentation.pdf|title=Debt levels remain high following the crisis June FAR Slide 7 | publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council | date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Fiscal-Assessment-Report-June-2017-Final.pdf|title=Section 1.2.2 Recent Fiscal Context June FAR Page 14  | publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council | date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It shows how difficult making Ireland's EU Debt Rule committments will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Website-AN5.pdf | title=Future Implications of the Debt Rule | publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council | date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this, IFAC advised the Irish Government against using funds, or proceeds from State asset sales, to stimulate the fast-growing Irish economy, and instead use for debt repayment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2017/0607/880813-national-debt-it-hasnt-gone-away-you-know/|title=National Debt - it hasn't gone away, you know | publisher=RTE News | date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Multinationals===

Eurostat (2015)]]
Corporation tax was 15.1% of Irish tax revenues in 2016 with 80% coming from foreign-owned multinationals.&lt;ref name="rev1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/research/corporation-tax-returns-2016.pdf|title=An Analysis of 2015 Corporation Tax Returns and 2016 Payments|publisher=Revenue Commissioners|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Irish corporate tax revenue jumped 49% in 2015 alone (from €4.61bn to €6.87bn),&lt;ref name="rev1"/&gt; the year of Apple's Irish restructuring.  This is in an environment where foreign-owned multinationals, attracted to Ireland's corporate tax system, contributed €28.3bn in payments to the Irish economy in 2016 (corporate taxes, wages, and capital spending).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idaireland.com/newsroom/publications/ireland-s-economic-and-competitiveness-update-q1|title=IDA Ireland Competitiveness|publisher=IDA Ireland|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also in an environment where the 2017 US [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|TCJA]] legislation, and the EU "digital tax" (and [[Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base|CCCTB]]), are threats to the Irish corporate tax system. 

IFAC have reported on the volatility and concentration of Ireland corporation tax payments, with the top 20 payers now making up almost 40% of all corporation tax payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AN-10-Challenges-Forecasting-Irish-Corporation-Tax-Final-Web.pdf|title=Analytical Note 10 Challenges Forecasting Irish Corporation Tax |publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chairperson of IFAC, Seamus Coffey, was separately commissioned by the Irish Government to review Ireland's Corporate Tax Code.&lt;ref name="coffey1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/updates/minister-donohoe-publishes-review-of-irelands-corporation-tax-code/|title=Minister Donohoe publishes Review of Ireland’s Corporation Tax Code|publisher=Department of Finance|date=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coffey2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/170912-Review-of-Irelands-Corporation-Tax-Code.pdf|title=REVIEW OF IRELAND’S CORPORATION TAX CODE, PRESENTED TO THE MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND REFORM BY MR. SEAMUS COFFEY|publisher=Department of Finance|date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While corporate tax recipts were found to be sustainable for the near future (to 2020),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/strong-corporate-tax-receipts-sustainable-until-2020-1.3218290?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fstrong-corporate-tax-receipts-sustainable-until-2020-1.3218290|title=Strong corporate tax receipts ‘sustainable’ until 2020| publisher=Irish Times|date=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was recommended that some multinational tax allowances be scaled back (i.e. capital allowances capped at 80%) to improve tax revenue sustainability.

IFAC noted Ireland’s exposure to U.S. multinationals in the June 2018 report and the impact of a single multinational leaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/losing-just-one-big-multinational-would-leave-ireland-nursing-a-276m-tax-shortfall-36981003.html|title=Losing just one big multinational would leave Ireland nursing a €276m tax shortfall|publisher=Irish Independent|date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The high exposure of Ireland's economy to U.S. multinationals (14 of Ireland's top 20 firms, a quarter of the Irish labourforce), is discussed in more detail [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Low tax economy|here]].  The former IMF mission chief to Ireland, [[Ashoka Mody]], has emphasised how the changes to international tax regimes (i.e. [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]), could make this event likely, and on a bigger and synchronised scale (discussed [[Double Irish arrangement#Effect of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act|here]]):

The '''Jantar Mantar''' is an [[equinox|equinoctial]] [[sundial]], consisting of a gigantic triangular [[gnomon]] with the [[hypotenuse]] parallel to the [[Earth]]'s axis.  On either side of the gnomon is a quadrant of a circle, parallel to the plane of the [[equator]].  The instrument is intended to measure the time of day, correct to half a second and [[declination]] of the [[Sun]] and the other [[Astronomical object|heavenly bodies]].

There are five Jantar Mantars in [[India]], of which [[Jantar Mantar (Jaipur)|the largest]] is in [[Jaipur]] which features many instruments along with the world's largest stone sundial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smithsonian|title=Timelines of Science|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1465414342|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vrihat Samrat yantra is a sundial that can give the local time to an accuracy of 2 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://amerjaipur.in/Amer-monuments-description.php?mid=10&amp;name=Jantar%20Mantar%20Jaipur|title = Jantar Mantar Jaipur|date = |accessdate = 2016-01-01|website = amerjaipur.in|publisher = |last = pareek|first = Amit kumar pareek and Agam kumar}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;.

==History==
In the early 18th century, [[Maharaja]] [[Jai Singh II]] of [[Jaipur]] constructed five Jantar Mantars in total, in [[Jantar Mantar, New Delhi|New Delhi]], [[Jantar Mantar (Jaipur)|Jaipur]], [[Ujjain]], [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] and [[Jantar Mantar, Varanasi|Varanasi]]; they were completed between 1724 and 1735.

The jantars have like Samrat Yantra, Jai Prakash, Ram Yantra and Niyati Chakra; each of which are used to for various astronomical calculations. The primary purpose of the observatory was to compile astronomical tables, and to predict the times and movements of the [[sun]], [[moon]] and [[planets]].&lt;ref&gt;Sankalp India Foundation. ''[http://sankalpindia.net/drupal/?q=jantart-mantar-get-lost-space Jantart Mantar: Get lost in space!]'' (2008-07-22).&lt;/ref&gt;

List Of Instruments:

* Samrat Yantra
* Jai Prakash Yantra
* Disha Yantra
* Rama Yantra
* Chakra Yantra
* Rashiwalay Yantra
* Dingash Yantra
* Utaansh Yantra

==Name==
The name "Jantar Mantar" is at least 200 years old, finding a mention in an account from 1803.&lt;ref name=sjsa/&gt; However, the archives of Jaipur State, such as accounts from 1735 and 1737–1738, do not use this as ''Jantra'', which in the spoken language is corrupted to ''Jantar''.&lt;ref name=sjsa/&gt; The word ''Jantra'' is derived from ''[[yantra]]'', instrument, while the suffix ''Mantar'' is derived from mantrana meaning consult or calculate.&lt;ref name=sjsa/&gt; The words ''jantar'' and ''mantar'' (or ''yantra'' and ''mantra'') mean calculation instrument.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18279">A '''jobless recovery''' or '''jobless growth''' is an economic phenomenon in which a [[macroeconomy]] experiences [[economic growth|growth]] while maintaining or decreasing its level of [[employment]].  The term was coined by the economist Nick Perna in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=INDUSTRY ADOPTS POLITICAL PLANKS FOR NEW DEAL WAR; OLD ORDER IS UPHELD|url=https://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/#/%22jobless+recovery%22/since1851/allresults/1/allauthors/oldest/|accessdate=10 November 2013|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=6 December 1935|quote=Pay Articles from December 1935 Part 7 - Site Map - The New York ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/10/jobless-recovery-the-new-normal.asp|title=Jobless Recovery: The New Normal Since 1990 {{!}} Investopedia|last=Smith|first=Lisa|date=2010-08-17|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Economists are still divided about the causes and cures of a jobless recovery: some argue that increased [[productivity]] through [[automation]] has allowed [[economic growth]] without reducing [[unemployment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16990700|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=2010-09-09|title=Automatic Reaction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other economists state that blaming automation is an example of the [[luddite fallacy]]&lt;ref name="easterly"&gt;{{cite book |last=Easterly |first=William |authorlink=William Easterly |title=The Elusive Quest for Growth: Economists' Adventures and Misadventures in the Tropics |year=2001 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |isbn=0-262-55042-3 |pages=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that jobless recoveries stem from structural changes in the labor market, leading to unemployment as workers change jobs or industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/current_issues/ci9-8.html |publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York |title=Has Structural Change Contributed to a Jobless Recovery? |author=Erica L. Groshen |author2=Simon Potter |date=Aug 2003 |volume=9 |number=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial consolidation===
Some have argued that the recent lack of job creation in the United States is due to increased [[industrial consolidation]] and growth of [[monopoly]] or [[oligopoly]] power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2010/1003.lynn-longman.html Who Broke America’s Jobs Machine? Why creeping consolidation is crushing American livelihoods.], by Barry C. Lynn and Phillip Longman, ''[[Washington Monthly]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is twofold: firstly, small businesses create most American jobs, and secondly, small businesses have more difficulty starting and growing in the face of entrenched existing businesses (compare [[infant industry argument]], applied at the level of industries, rather than individual firms).

== Population growth vs. employment growth ==
[[File:US Employment growth vs Population Growth by decade.jpg|340px|thumb]]
In addition to employment growth, population growth must also be considered concerning the perception of jobless recoveries. Immigrants and new entrants to the workforce will often accept lower wages, causing [[Underemployment equilibrium|persistent unemployment]] among those who were previously employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Camerota Ph.D.|first=Stephen A.|title=A Jobless Recovery?: Immigrant Gains and Native Losses|url=https://cis.org/node/245|publisher=[[Center for Immigration Studies]]|accessdate=2 March 2014|date=October 2004|quote=Between March of 2000 and 2004, the number of unemployed adult natives increased by 2.3 million, while the number of employed adult immigrants increased by 2.3 million.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peri|first=Giovanni|title=Immigration, Labor Markets, and Productivity|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj32n1/cj32n1-4.pdf|publisher=Cato Journal, Vol. 32, No. 1 (Winter 2012).|accessdate=2 March 2014|quote=In this case firms pay immigrants less than their marginal productivity, increasing the firms’ profits.

Surprisingly, the U.S. [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS) does not offer data-sets isolated to the working-age population (ages 16 to 65).&lt;ref name="BLS POP vs EMP"/&gt; Including retirement age individuals in most BLS data-sets may tend to obfuscate the analysis of employment creation in relation to population growth.&lt;ref name="Boomers BLS"/&gt; Additionally, incorrect assumptions about the term, Labor force, might also occur when reading BLS publications, millions of employable persons are not included within the official definition. The Labor force, as defined by the BLS,&lt;ref name="BLS Labor Force"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary|url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm#L|work=Labor Force|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=2 March 2014|quote=Labor force (Current Population Survey) The labor force includes all persons classified as employed or unemployed in accordance with the definitions contained in this glossary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a strict definition of those officially unemployed (U-3),&lt;ref name="BLS Underutilization"&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic News Release|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm|work=HOUSEHOLD DATA Table A-15.

 |quote  = Once again, the baby-boom generation has become a generator of change, this time in its retirement. Moreover, the jobless recovery of the 2001 recession, coupled with the severe economic impact of the 2007–2009 recession, caused disruptions in the labor market. In the first 12 years of the 21st century, the growth of the population has slowed and labor force participation rates generally have declined. As a result, labor force growth also has slowed. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that the next 10 years will bring about an aging labor force that is growing slowly, a declining overall labor force participation rate, and more diversity in the racial and ethnic composition of the labor force.

The following table and included chart depicts year-to-year employment growth in comparison to population growth for those persons under 65 years of age. As such, [[Baby boomers|baby boomer]] retirements are removed from the data as a factor for consideration. The table includes the Bureau of Labor Statistics, [[Current Population Survey]], for the [[Civilian noninstitutional population]] and corresponding Employment Levels, dating from 1948 and includes October 2013, the age groups are 16 years &amp; over, and 65 years &amp; over.&lt;ref name="BLS POP vs EMP"/&gt; The working-age population is then determined by subtracting those age 65 and over from the Civilian noninstitutional population and Employment Levels respectively. Isolated into the traditional working-age subset, growth in both employment levels and population levels are totaled by decade, an employment percentage rate is also displayed for comparison by decade.

When examined, by decade, the first decade of the 2000s, the United States suffered a 95% jobless rate when compared to the added working age population.

'''Kleinjena''' is situated 4 kilometres north of Naumburg on a long spur at the foot of the Finne mountain range above the village of Kleinjena, at the heart of [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in the State of [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. The World Heritage nomination is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called “[[Landesausbau]]”  and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2017): WHC/17/41.COM/INF.8B1.{{cite book|title=Nominations to the World Heritage List (Krakow, 2017).|publisher= UNESCO press|page=54|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lanscape around Neuenburg.jpg|thumb|Landscape around Neuenburg]]

== World Heritage Nomination ==
The castle of Kleinjena is one of the eleven components of the cultural landscape [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]]. As Kleinjena marks the starting point for the vast growth of the region in the [[12th century]], it is indispensable for an understanding of the history of this [[cultural landscape]] as a whole.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Förderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut e.V. is the coordinating body for this nomination: http://www.naumburg-cathedral.de/.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The castle of Kleinjena was built by the influential [[Ekkehard]]ine dynasty. This dynasty owned estates in the old settlement area in the northern part of [[Thuringia]] and in the area of the conﬂuence of the rivers [[Saale]] and [[Unstrut]]. The family seat was the castle of Gene, which was situated south of the Unstrut River in the former diocese of the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Ekkehardiner, Markgrafen von Meißen und ihre Beziehungen zum Reich und zu den Piasten (= Europäische Hochschulschriften. Reihe 3: Geschichte und ihre Hilfswissenschaften. Bd. 691).|trans-title=The Ekkerhardines, margraves of Meißen and their relations in the empire (European university publications. Number 3: History and related sciences. Bd. 691.|author=Rupp, Gabriele|publisher=Lang|date=1996|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other [[Ottonian]] [[palace]]s or imperial [[castles]] of the time, the castle complex of Ekkehard I was a segmented complex with two ramparts on a ﬂat spur. Its main rampart and the related trench have ﬂattened to a great extent, but they are still clearly visible in the terrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mitteldeutsche Geschichte. Sachsen - Sachsen-Anhalt - Thüringen.|trans-title=Central German history. Saxony - Saxony-Anhalt-Thuringia|author=Raßloff, Steffen|publisher=Edition Leipzig|date=2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the murder of [[Ekkehard I]], the site was gradually abandoned as the margravial brothers Hermann and Ekkehard II transferred their family seatfrom Kleinjena to Naumburg (Nuenburch), first mentioned in the records in 1012.  
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Entstehung der Landesherrschaft in Thüringen (= Mitteldeutsche Forschungen.Teil 1. )|trans-title=The development of the Landgoves in Thuringia (= Central German Research. Part 1.)|author=Patze, Hans|publisher=Saxony-Anhalt|date=1962|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Certificate Emperor Conrad.tif|thumb|Certificate Emperor Conrad]]
Encouraged by a privilege granted by [[Emperor Conrad II]] in 1033, also the merchants of Kleinjena moved to Naumburg, since they were guaranteed free trade and the heritable, interest-free ownership of their enclosed domicile. The comparative advantage of Naumburg was also a topographical one as that the descent of the long-distance routes coming from the plateau was not as steep as in Kleinjena and Grossjena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geschichte Thüringens|trans-title=History of Thuringia|pages=15–79|author=Raßloff, Steffen|publisher=Beck|date=2010|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==
These archeologically documented remains of the [[castle]] of the [[Margraves of Meissen|Markgraves of Meißen]], the Ekkehardines, date back to the [[10th century]].  At the European level, these preserved structures are an early evidence of the efforts undertaken by the high nobility to impose its centre of power through large-scale fortifications that eventually served as their memorials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Burgen der Ekkehardinger an der Unstrutmündung(1.

Lichens are grouped by common '''lichen growth forms'''. There are a wide range of growth forms ([[morphology (biology)|morphology]]). These groupings may not be consistent with lichen [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], since lichens with similar growth forms are not necessarily related by ancestry. Groups based on growth may overlap and have borderline cases. A species usually has the same overall growth form wherever it is found, but not always.&lt;ref name=WIL&gt;[https://www.anbg.gov.au/lichen/what-is-lichen.html What is a lichen?, Australian National Botanical Garden]&lt;/ref&gt;

Common groupings of lichens based on overall growth form include 1. bushy or shrubby ([[fruticose lichen|fruticose]]) 2. leafy ([[foliose lichen|foliose]]) 3. crust-like ([[crustose lichen|crustose]]) 4. scaly ([[Squamulose lichen|squamulose]]) 5. stringy ([[wikt:filamentose|filamentose]]), 6. whispy ([[Byssoid lichen|Byssoid]]), 7. powdery ([[Leprose lichen|leprose]]), or 8. structureless (e.g., [[Gelatinous lichen|gelatinous]]). Ways of grouping by growth forms is usually based on the form of the part of lichen that is not involved in sexual reproduction, the "vegetative" part, which is called the [[thallus]]. This includes both the fungus (mycobiont) and the algae and/or cyanobacteria cells (photobiont) they surround, but does not include any part with sexual fruit bodies of the mycobiont. The thallus may or may not have a "skin", a surface layer of differentiated tissue that covers the undifferentiated middle tissue, the [[Glossary of botanical terms#medulla|medulla]]. When part of a lichen has a cortex it is called [[wikt:corticate|corticate]].&lt;ref name=ASLGAF&gt;[http://www.lichens.lastdragon.org/faq/glossary1.html Alan Silverside's Lichen Glossary (a-f), Alan Silverside]&lt;/ref&gt; If it lacks a cortex it is called [[ecorticate (lichen)|ecorticate]].&lt;ref name=ASLGGO&gt;[http://www.lichens.lastdragon.org/faq/glossary2.html Alan Silverside's Lichen Glossary (g-o), Alan Silverside]&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple way to group lichens that requires use of a microscope to see a lichen's surface structure ([[anatomy]]) is by the presence or absence of a "skin" ([[Cortex (botany)|cortex]]). Fruticose lichens have one cortex encircling the "branches", even when the branches are flattened and look like "leaves". Foliose lichens have a separate upper cortex and lower cortex on each side of the "leaf". Crustose and squamulose lichens have an upper cortex, but do not have a lower cortex. Filimentous,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} byssoid,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} leprose,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} and other lichens do not have a cortex (are ecorticate).

The following are commonly used groupings for lichens:
* 1. [[fruticose lichen|fruticose]] (branched, 3-dimiensional, one cortex surrounds thallus), e.g., ''[[Cladonia|Cladonia evansii]]'', ''[[Cladonia|C. subtenuis]]'', and ''[[Usnea|Usnea australis]]'' - The thallus is extended up, or hangs down, in a branched or tufted structure.
* 2. [[foliose lichen|foliose]] (leafy, 2-dimensional planes, two cortices&amp;nbsp;– upper and lower), e.g., ''[[Hypogymnia|Hypogymnia physodes]]''&amp;nbsp;– The thallus generally forms flat, leaf-like lobes that are not firmly bonded to the substrate, with the underside having its own cortex.
* 3. [[Crustose]] lichens (paint-like, flat, 2-dimensional, upper cortex, no lower cortex), e.g., ''[[Caloplaca marina]] ''- The thallus lies flat and tightly bound at all points to the substrate, like it is painted on.
:*3a. Crustose [[Placodioid lichen|placodioid]] (flattened and radiating out from a center, possibly raising up to being leaf-like at the outer edges with no cortex under raised part if present) - The thallus structure radiates out, with the outer edges peeling up from the substrate at the tips. These may peel up so much as to appear like foliose lichens, but unlike foliose lichens, they lack a cortex under the edges that lift from the substrate.
* 4. [[squamulose lichen|squamulose]] (scale-like or platelet-like, upper cortex but no lower cortex under raised portion), e.g., ''[[Normandina|Normandina pulchella]]'' - The thallus is composed of mostly flat laying, overlapping, scale-like plates ("squamules"), which may become leaf-like in form where they are not attached to the substrate, but which do not have a lower cortex on the underside. Some lichenologists consider squamulous lichens to be a special kind of crustose lichen.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;
* 5. [[filamentous lichen|Filamentous]] (hairlike), e.g., ''[[Ephebe (lichen)|Ephebe lanata]]'', ''[[Cystocoleus ebeneus]]''&amp;nbsp;– The thallus forms mostly nonbranching hair-like structures that may look overall like matted hair.
* 6. [[Byssoid lichen|Byssoid]] (whispy), e.g., ''[[Coenogonium implexum]]''&amp;nbsp;– Whispy like [[teased cotton]] or [[teased wool]].&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;
* 7. [[Leprose lichen|leprose]] (powdery), e.g., ''[[Lepraria|Lepraria incana]]''&amp;nbsp;– The thallus is a layer so thin that it is almost like a powder stuck to the substrate.
* 8. Structureless&amp;nbsp;– Lichens may not have a recognizable thallus structure, including [[Collema|gelatinous lichens]] where the cyanobacteria produce a [[polysaccharide]] that absorbs and retains water.

Since growth forms may be variable, there are gray areas between these groups, and there is overlap, placement of lichens in these groups is not definite. Placement of a lichen in one of these groups may vary from author to author.

Sometimes, such as when the thallus grows ''inside'' solid rock, between the grains, only the fruiting part of a lichen is visible, and this may be visible in a dramatic way (e.g., ''[[Caloplaca luteominea]]'' subspecies ''bolandri'').&lt;ref name=LV&gt;Lichen Vocabulary, LICHENS OF NORTH AMERICA, Sylvia and Stephen Sharnoff, [http://www.lichen.com/vocabulary.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mathura art''' refers to a particular school of [[Buddhist art]], which centered on the city of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], in central northern [[India]], during the period in which [[Buddhism]] flourished in India. The art of Mathura is usually contrasted with the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]]. In particular there is a debate about the origin of the Buddha image and the role played by each school of art. Before the creation of an image of the Buddha, probably around the 1st century CE, Indian Buddhist art had essentially been [[aniconic]], avoiding representation of the Buddha, but rather relying on its symbols, such as the [[Dharmachakra|Wheel of the Law]] or the [[Bodhi tree]]. 

==Early history==
[[File:Yaksha Parkham Mathura with detail.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Manibhadra|Parkham Yaksha]] (2nd-1st century BCE). The hem of the dress is sometimes considered as derived from Greek art. Describing a similar statue, John Boardman writes: "It has no local antecedents and looks most like a Greek Late Archaic mannerism". According to Boardman these folds are also similar to those of the [[Bharhut]] Yavana [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bharhut_Yavana.jpg].&lt;ref&gt;John Boardman, "The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity", Princeton University Press, 1993, p.112&lt;/ref&gt;]]
===Mauryan and Indo-Greek rule===
Mathura was an important city of central northern [[India]] for the [[Maurya Empire]], whose capital was in eastern India at [[Pataliputra]]. [[Mauryan art]] flourished during that period. Following the demise of the Mauryan Empire and its replacement by the [[Sunga Empire]], numismatic, literary and epigraphic evidence suggest that the [[Indo-Greek]]s, when they invaded India, occupied the area of Mathura for close to a century from the time of [[Menander I]] until approximately 70 BCE, with the Sungas remaining eastward of Mathura. From numismatic, literary and epigraphic evidence, it seems that the [[Indo-Greeks]] had control over [[Mathura]] at some time, especially during the rule of [[Menander I]] (165-135 BC).&lt;ref name="Rhie"&gt;History of Early Stone Sculpture at Mathura: Ca. 150 BCE - 100 CE, Sonya Rhie Quintanilla, BRILL, 2007, p.8-10 [https://books.google.com/books?id=X7Cb8IkZVSMC&amp;pg=PA8]&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription in Mathura discovered in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;Published in "L'Indo-Grec Menandre ou Paul Demieville revisite," Journal Asiatique 281 (1993) p.113&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Yavanarajya inscription]], mentions "The last day of year 116 of Yavana hegemony (''Yavanarajya'')", suggesting the presence of the Indo-Greeks in the 2nd-1st century BC in Mathura down to 70 or 69 BC.&lt;ref name="Rhie"/&gt; On the contrary, the [[Sungas]], are known to have been absent from Mathura (no epigraphical or coin remains) and only located eastward of the Mathura region.&lt;ref name="Rhie"/&gt;

====The Parkham Yaksha (2nd-1st century BCE)====
Some of the earliest works of art of the Mathura school are the [[Yaksha]]s, monumental sculptures of earth divinities that have been dated to the 2nd-1st century BCE, possibly starting during the time of the Mauryas or after. These Yakshas, such as the [[Manibhadra|Parkham Yaksha]], although essentially Indian in style, usually suggest some Hellenistic influence, such as the geometrical folds of the drapery or the walking stance of the statues. The Parkham Yaksha is datable to period 200 BCE – 50 BC&lt;ref&gt;Costumes &amp; Ornaments As Depicted in the Early Sculpture of Gwalior Museum By Sulochana Ayyar, Mittal Publications, 1 December 1987, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; According to Upinder Singh, the statue is 2.59 meters high. On stylistic grounds it should be dated to the 2nd/1st century BC, but an inscription in Brahmi suggest a 3rd century BC date. The inscription says "Made by Gomitaka, a pupil of Kunika. Set up by eight brothers, members of the Manibhadra congregation ("puga")." This inscription thus indicates that the statue represents the Yaksa [[Manibhadra]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA365 "A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12 the century" by Upinder Singh p.365]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Boardman (art historian)|John Boardman]], the hem of the dress is derived from Greek art. Describing a similar statue, John Boardman writes: "It has no local antecedents and looks most like a Greek Late Archaic mannerism". Similar folds can be seen in the Bharhut Yavana.&lt;ref&gt; [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bharhut_Yavana.jpg Bharut Yavana] (John Boardman, "The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity", Princeton University Press, 1993, p.112.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indo-Scythian rule===
[[File:MathuraLionCapital.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Mathura lion capital]], 1st century CE.]]
From around 70 BCE, the region of Mathura fell to Indian rulers of the [[Mitra dynasty]] and then to the [[Indo-Scythian]] [[Northern Satraps]] under Rajuvula. Little is known precisely from that period on terms of artistic creation. The Indo-Scythian [[Rajuvula]], ruler of Mathura, created coins which were copies of the [[Indo-Greek]] ruler [[Strato II]], with effigy of the king and representation of [[Athena]] on the obverse. 

====The Mathura lion capital (1st century CE)====
Rajuvula is also known for the famous [[Mathura lion capital]] which records events of the Indo-Scythian dynasty as well as their support of Buddhism. It is also an interesting example of the state of artistic attainment in the city of Mathura at the turn of our era. The capital portrays two lions reminiscent of the lions of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]], but in a much cruder style. It also displays at its center a Buddhist [[triratana]] symbol, further confirming the involvement of Indo-Scythian rulers with Buddhism. The triratna is contained in a [[flame palmette]], an element of Hellenistic iconography, and an example of [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art]].

===Kushan rule===

Mathura then became the capital of the [[Kushan Empire]] from around 30 CE. 

====Bodhisattva statues (2nd century CE)====
One dated example of statuary from that period is the [[Bala Bodhisattva]], which, although not from Mathura but from [[Sarnath]] clearly describes the state of artistic attainment under the rule of Kushan ruler Kanishka. The Bala Boddhisattva is also nearly identical in style with other known statues from Mathura but definitely dated with an inscription as is the case for the Bala Boddhisattva.

The style of these statues is somewhat reminiscent of the earlier monumental [[Yaksha]] statues, usually dated to a few centuries earlier. On the contrary, despite other known instances of [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art]], very little, if anything at all can be seen in this type of statue. Especially the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]] seems to have had little to no influence.&lt;ref&gt;Origin of the Buddha Image, June Coomaraswamy, p.300-301 [http://www.tepotech.com/Art_Bulletin/192794JuneCoomaraswamyOriginoftheBuddhaImage.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Buddha coinage (Circa 130 CE)====
[[File:Kanishka Buddha detail.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Depiction of the [[Buddha]] (with legend ΒΟΔΔΟ "Boddo") in Kanishka's coinage.]]
From his capital of Mathura or alternatively from the capital of his territories of the northwest, [[Peshawar]], [[Kanishka]] issued the first known representation of the [[Buddha]] on a coin, and actually the first known representation of the Buddha that can be dated precisely, in this case, to the reign of Kanishka (127–150 CE). The [[Bimaran casket]] is usually dated to 50 CE, but with less certainty than the Kanishka coin.

Only six Kushan coins of the Buddha are known in gold (the sixth one is the centerpiece of an ancient piece of jewellery, consisting of a Kanishka Buddha coin decorated with a ring of heart-shaped ruby stones). All these coins were minted in gold under Kanishka I, and are in two different denominations: a [[dinar]] of about 8 gm, roughly similar to a Roman [[aureus]], and a quarter dinar of about 2 gm. (about the size of an [[obol (coin)|obol]]). The Buddha is represented wearing the monastic robe, the ''[[antaravasaka]]'', the ''[[uttarasanga]]'', and the overcoat ''[[sanghati]]''. In general, the representation of the Buddha on these coins is already highly symbolic, and quite distinct from the more naturalistic and Hellenistic images seen in early Gandhara sculptures. On several designs a mustache is apparent. The palm of his right hand bears the [[Chakra]] mark, and his brow bear the [[urna]]. An [[aureola]], formed by one, two or three lines, surrounds him. The full gown worn by the Buddha on the coins, covering both shoulders, suggests a Gandharan model rather than a Mathuran one, and the style is clearly Hellenistic.

Kanishka also issued other types of Buddhist coinage, representation a "Shakyamuni Buddha" standing and walking, as well as a seated "Maitreya Buddha". It should be noted however that Maitreya is a [[Bodhisattva]] and not a [[Buddha]] according to the Buddhist cannon.

====The Mathura standing Buddha====
[[File:Buddha in Abhaya Mudra - Circa 2nd Century CE - ACCN 00-A-4 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-23 5692.JPG|thumb|A Mathura standing Buddha, [[Mathura Museum]]]]
The Mathura standing Buddha seems to be a slightly later development compared to the Bodhisattvas of the type of the [[Bala Bodhisattva]]. Although several are dated to the 2nd century CE, they often tend to display characteristics of [[Gupta Empire|Gupta art]], especially with the very thin dress seemingly sticking to the body of the Buddha. These statues of the Buddha however tend to display characteristic and attitudes more readily seen in the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]]: the head of the Buddha is surrounded by a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], the clothing covers both shoulders, the left hand hold the gown of the Buddha while the other hand form an [[Mudra|Abbhiya mudra]], and the folds in the clothing are more typical of the Gandharan styles.&lt;ref name="Banerjee"&gt;Hellenism in Ancient India, Gauranga Nath Banerjee, p.96-98 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mCtKn4J1n38C&amp;pg=PA97]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many respect, the standing Buddha of Mathura seems to be a combination of the local sculptural tradition initiated by the [[Yaksha]]s with the Hellenistic designs of the Buddhas from the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of Gandhara.&lt;ref name="Banerjee"/&gt;

====Other sculptural works====
The Mathura sculptures incorporate many Hellenistic elements, such as the general idealistic realism, and key design elements such as the curly hair, and folded garment. 

[[File:Life of the Buddha Mathura.jpg|thumb|left|A Mathura relief showing the complete life of the Buddha, from birth to death. The clothing is Gandharan.]]
Specific Mathuran adaptations tend to reflect warmer climatic conditions, as they consist in a higher fluidity of the clothing, which progressively tend to cover only one shoulder instead of both. Also, facial types also tend to become more Indianized. Banerjee in ''Hellenism in ancient India'' describes "the mixed character of the Mathura School in which we find on the one hand, a direct continuation of the old Indian art of [[Barhut]] and [[Sanchi]] and on the other hand, the classical influence derived from Gandhara".&lt;ref&gt;Banerjee, ''Hellenism in ancient India''&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases however, a clear influence from the art of Gandhara can also be felt, as in the case of the Hellenistic statue of [[Herakles]] strangling the [[Nemean lion]], discovered in Mathura, and now in the [[Kolkota]] [[Indian Museum]], as well as [[Bacchanalian]] scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Aspects of Indian Art, by J.E. Van Lohuizen-De Leuve, published by Pratapaditya Pal [https://books.google.com/books?id=ttEUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hellenism in Ancient India by Gauranga Nath Banerjee [https://books.google.com/books?id=mCtKn4J1n38C&amp;pg=PA90 p.90]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art of India by Vincent Arthur Smith [https://books.google.com/books?id=s3elCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT98 p.98]&lt;/ref&gt; Although inspired from the art of Gandhara, the portraiture of Herakles is not perfectly exact and may show a lack of understanding of the subject matter, as Herakles is shown already wearing the skin of the lion he is fighting.&lt;ref&gt;History of Early Stone Sculpture at Mathura: Ca. 150 BCE - 100 CE by Sonya Rhie Quintanilla [https://books.google.com/books?id=X7Cb8IkZVSMC&amp;pg=PA158 p.158]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Dynastic Arts of the Kushans by John M.

==Hindu art==

[[Hindu art]] started to develop from the 1st to the 2nd century CE and found its first inspiration in the Buddhist art of Mathura. It progressively incorporated a profusion of original Hindu stylistic and symbolic elements however, in contrast with the general balance and simplicity of Buddhist art.

The art of Mathura features frequent sexual imagery. Female images with bare breasts, nude below the waist, displaying labia and female genitalia are common. These images are more sexually explicit than those of earlier or later periods.

'''Mental rotation''' is the ability to [[rotate]] [[mental image|mental representations]] of [[dimension|two-dimensional]] and [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] objects as it is related to the visual representation of such rotation within the human mind.&lt;ref name="Shepard 701–703"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shepard|first=Roger N.|last2=Metzler|first2=Jacqueline|date=1971-02-19|title=Mental Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/171/3972/701|journal=Science|language=en|volume=171|issue=3972|pages=701–703|doi=10.1126/science.171.3972.701|issn=0036-8075|pmid=5540314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Mental rotation, as a function of visual representation in the human brain, has been associated with the right [[cerebral hemisphere]]. There is a relationship between similar areas of the brain associated with [[perception]] and mental rotation.

Mental rotation has been studied to try to figure out how the mind recognizes objects in their environment. Researchers generally call such objects [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. Mental rotation is one cognitive function for the person to figure out what the altered object is.

Mental rotation can be separated into the following [[Cognition|cognitive]] stages:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Create a mental image of an object from all directions (imagining where it continues straight vs. turns)
# Rotate the object mentally until a comparison can be made (orientating the stimulus to other figure)
# Make the comparison
# Decide if the objects are the same or not
# Report the decision (reaction time is recorded when level pulled or button pushed)

==Assessment==
In a mental rotation [[Psychological assessment|test]], the participant compares two [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] objects (or [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]]), often rotated in some axis, and states if they are the same [[image]] or if they are [[mirror image]]s ([[Chirality (mathematics)|enantiomorphs]]).&lt;ref name="Shepard 701–703"/&gt; Commonly, the test will have pairs of images each rotated a specific number of [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] (e.g. 0°, 60°, 120° or 180°). A set number of pairs will be split between being the same image rotated, while others are mirrored. The researcher judges the participant on how [[Accuracy|accurately]] and [[Rate (mathematics)|rapidly]] they can distinguish between the mirrored and non-mirrored pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=What does the Mental Rotation Test Measure?

==Notable research==

=== Shepard and Metzler (1971) ===

[[Roger Shepard]] and Jacqueline Metzler (1971) were some of the first to research the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, R. N., &amp; Metzler, J., "Mental rotation: Effects of Dimensionality of Objects and Type of Task", ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance]]'', Vol 14, Feb 1988, pp. 3-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Their experiment specifically tested mental rotation on three-dimensional objects. Each subject was presented with multiple pairs of three-dimensional, asymmetrical lined or cubed objects. The experiment was designed to measure how long it would take each subject to determine whether the pair of objects were indeed the same object or two different objects. Their [[research]] showed that the [[reaction time]] for participants to decide if the pair of items matched or not was [[Linear#Linear functions|linearly]] [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[angle]] of rotation from the original position. That is, the more an object has been rotated from the original, the longer it takes an individual to determine if the two images are of the same object or enantiomorphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Mental Rotation of Three-Dimensional Objects|url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/1120/ps/ps3/mental-rotation.pdf|journal=Science|year=1971|author1=Shepard, R.

=== Vandenburg and Kuse (1978) ===
{{main|Mental Rotations Test}}
In 1978, [[Steven G. Vandenberg]] and Allan R. Kuse developed a test to assess mental rotation abilities that was based on Shepard and Metzler's (1971) original study. The [[Mental Rotations Test]] was constructed using India ink drawings. Each stimulus was a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional object drawn by a computer. The image was then displayed on an oscilloscope. Each image was then shown at different orientations rotated around the vertical axis. Following the basic ideas of Shepard and Metzler's experiment, this study found a significant difference in the mental rotation scores between men and women, with men performing better. Correlations with other measures showed strong association with tests of spatial visualization and no association with verbal ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandenberg|first=Steven|date=1978|title=Mental Rotations, a Group Test of Three-Dimensional Spatial Visualization|pmid=724398|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=47|issue=2|pages=599–604|doi=10.2466/pms.1978.47.2.599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Michael|date=2005-03-01|title=Sex differences and the factor of time in solving Vandenberg and Kuse mental rotation problems|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278262604002398|journal=Brain and Cognition|volume=57|issue=2|pages=176–184|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2004.08.052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neural activity ==
In 1999, a study was conducted to find out which part of the brain is activated during mental rotation. Seven volunteers (four males and three females) between the ages of twenty-nine to sixty-six participated in this experiment. For the study, the subjects were shown eight characters 4 times each (twice in normal orientation and twice reversed) and the subjects had to decide if the character was in its normal configuration or if it was the mirror image. During this task, a PET scan was performed and revealed activation in the right posterior parietal lobe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Irina M.|last2=Egan|first2=Gary F.|last3=Sonkkila|first3=Cynon|last4=Tochon-Danguy|first4=Henri J.|last5=Paxinos|first5=George|last6=Watson|first6=John D. G.|date=2000-01-01|title=Selective right parietal lobe activation during mental rotation|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/123/1/65|journal=Brain|language=en|volume=123|issue=1|pages=65–73|doi=10.1093/brain/123.1.65|issn=0006-8950|pmid=10611121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]]&amp;nbsp;studies of brain activation during mental rotation reveal consistent increased activation of the parietal lobe, specifically the inter-parietal sulcus, that is dependent on the difficulty of the task. In general, the larger the angle of rotation, the more brain activity associated with the task. This increased brain activation is accompanied by longer times to complete the rotation task and higher error rates. Researchers have argued that the increased brain activation, increased time, and increased error rates indicate that task difficulty is proportional to the angle of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|title=Mental rotation of tactile stimuli|journal= Cognitive Brain Research|volume=14|doi=10.1016/S0926-6410(02)00063-0|pages=91–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gogos|first=Andrea|last2=Gavrilescu|first2=Maria|last3=Davison|first3=Sonia|last4=Searle|first4=Karissa|last5=Adams|first5=Jenny|last6=Rossell|first6=Susan L.|last7=Bell|first7=Robin|last8=Davis|first8=Susan R.|last9=Egan|first9=Gary F.|date=2010-01-01|title=Greater superior than inferior parietal lobule activation with increasing rotation angle during mental rotation: An fMRI study|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393209004163|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=48|issue=2|pages=529–535|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.10.013|pmid=19850055}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Clock rotated depth wise 90 degrees.png|thumb|Rotation in depth 90 degrees]][[File:Clock rotated in the picture plane 90 degrees.png|thumb|Rotation in the picture plane 90 degrees]]

==Color==
Physical objects that people imagine rotating in everyday life have many properties, such as textures, shapes, and colors. A study at the [[University of California Santa Barbara]] was conducted to specifically test the extent to which visual information, such as color, is represented during mental rotation. This study used several methods such as reaction time studies, verbal protocol analysis, and eye tracking. In the initial reaction time experiments, those with poor rotational ability were affected by the colors of the image, whereas those with good rotational ability were not. Overall, those with poor ability were faster and more accurate identifying images that were consistently colored. The verbal protocol analysis showed that the subjects with low [[spatial ability]] mentioned color in their mental rotation tasks more often than participants with high spatial ability. One thing that can be shown through this experiment is that those with higher rotational ability will be less likely to represent color in their mental rotation. Poor rotators will be more likely to represent color in their mental rotation using piecemeal strategies (Khooshabeh &amp; Hegarty, 2008).

==Effect on athleticism and artistic ability==
Research on how athleticism and artistic ability affect mental rotation has also been done. Pietsch, S., &amp; Jansen, P. (2012) showed that people who were athletes or musicians had faster reaction times than people who were not. They tested this by splitting people from the age of 18 and higher into three groups. Group 1 was students who were studying math, sports students and education students. It was found that through the mental rotation test students who were focused on sports did much better than those who were math or education majors. Also it was found that the male athletes in the experiment were faster than females, but male and female musicians showed no significant difference in reaction time.

Moreau, D., Clerc, et al. (2012) also investigated if athletes were more spatially aware than non-athletes. This experiment took undergraduate college students and tested them with the mental rotation test before any sport training, and then again afterward. The participants were trained in two different sports to see if this would help their spatial awareness. It was found that the participants did better on the mental rotation test after they had trained in the sports, than they did before the training. There are ways to train your spatial awareness. This experiment brought to the research that if people could find ways to train their mental rotation skills they could perform better in high context activities with greater ease.

A study investigated the effect of mental rotation on postural stability. Participants performed a MR (mental rotation) task involving either foot stimuli, hand stimuli, or non-body stimuli (a car) and then had to balance on one foot. The results suggested that MR tasks involving foot stimuli were more effective at improving balance than hand or car stimuli, even after 60 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=2&amp;sid=a3da1b76-fd74-4640-abfb-c61d3a4ecdeb%2540sessionmgr4010&amp;hid=4107&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%253d%253d#AN=2016-29576-008&amp;db=psyh|title=Improvement of postural stability during quiet standing obtained after mental rotation of foot stimuli.|last=Kawasaki|first=Tsubasa|date=2017-07-11|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers studied the difference in mental rotation ability between gymnasts, handball, and soccer players with both in-depth and in-plane rotations. Results suggested that athletes were better at performing mental rotation tasks that were more closely related to their sport of expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Effects of the axis of rotation and primordially solicited limb of high level athletes in a mental rotation task.|journal=Human Movement Science|volume=37|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hamdi_Habacha/publication/264241628_Effects_of_the_axis_of_rotation_and_primordially_solicited_limb_of_high_level_athletes_in_a_mental_rotation_task/links/5a107ee0a6fdccc2d79997bf/Effects-of-the-axis-of-rotation-and-primordially-solicited-limb-of-high-level-athletes-in-a-mental-rotation-task.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a correlation in mental rotation and motor ability in children, and this connection is especially strong in boys age 7–8. Children were known for having very connected motor and cognitive processes, and the study showed that this overlap is influenced by motor ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The role of rotational hand movements and general motor ability in children’s mental rotation performance.|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=6|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mental rotation test (MRT) was carried out on gymnasts, orienteers, runners, and non athletes. Results showed that non athletes were greatly outperformed by gymnasts and orienteers, but not runners. Gymnasts (egocentric athletes) did not outperform orienteers (allocentric athletes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Gymnasts and orienteers display better mental rotation performance than nonathletes.|journal=Journal of Individual Differences|volume=37|doi=10.1027/1614-0001/a000180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender ==
Different studies have shown that there is a difference between male and female in mental rotation tasks.

In order to explain this difference, we can look at the brain activation during a mental rotation task. In 2012, a study&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; have been done on people that graduated in sciences or in liberal arts. Males and females were asked to execute a mental rotation task, and their brain activity was recorded with an fMRI. The researchers found a difference of brain activation: males present a stronger activity in the area of the brain used in a mental rotation task.

A study from 2008 showed that this difference occurs early during development. The experiment was done on 3- to 4-month-old infants using a 2D mental rotation task. They used a preference apparatus that consists of observing during how much time the infant is looking at the stimulus. They started by familiarizing the participants with the number "1" and its rotations. Then they showed them a picture of a "1" rotated and its mirror image. The study showed that males are more interested by the mirror image. Females are equally interested by the "1" rotated and its mirror image. According to the study, this may mean that males and females, at least when infants, process mental rotation differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quinn|first=Paul C.|last2=Liben|first2=Lynn S.|date=2008-11-01|title=A Sex Difference in Mental Rotation in Young Infants|url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/19/11/1067|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=19|issue=11|pages=1067–1070|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02201.x|issn=0956-7976|pmid=19076474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study from 2015 was focused on women and their abilities in a mental rotation task and in an emotion recognition task. In this experiment, they induced a feeling or a situation in which women feel more powerful or less powerful. They were able to conclude that women in a situation of power are better in a mental rotation task (but less performant in an emotion recognition task) than other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissan|first=Tali|last2=Shapira|first2=Oren|last3=Liberman|first3=Nira|date=2015-10-01|title=Effects of Power on Mental Rotation and Emotion Recognition in Women|url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/41/10/1425|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|language=en|volume=41|issue=10|pages=1425–1437|doi=10.1177/0146167215598748|issn=0146-1672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studying differences between male and female brains can have interesting applications. For example, it could help in the understanding of the [[autism spectrum disorders]].

One of the theories concerning autism is the EMB ([[extreme male brain]]). This theory considers that autist have an "extreme male brain". In a study&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zapf|first=Alexandra C.|last2=Glindemann|first2=Liv A.|last3=Vogeley|first3=Kai|last4=Falter|first4=Christine M.|date=2015-04-17|title=Sex Differences in Mental Rotation and How They Add to the Understanding of Autism|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0124628|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=4|pages=e0124628|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0124628|issn=1932-6203|pmid=25884501|pmc=4401579}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2015, researchers confirmed that there is a difference between male and female in mental rotation task (by studying people without autism): Males are more successful. Then they highlighted the fact that autists do not have this "male performance" in a mental rotation task. They conclude their study by "autistic people do not have an extreme version of a male cognitive profile as proposed by the EMB theory".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

There may be relationships between competent bodily movement and the speed with which individuals can perform mental rotation.

'''Peaceworkers UK''' (PWUK) is part of the Peacebuilding Issues Programme of [[International Alert]]. Previously an independent [[non-governmental organisation]], PWUK became part of International Alert in 2006. PWUK focuses on raising standards in the field of conflict prevention, crisis management and peacebuilding through an integrated programme of research, training, assessment and recruitment. It is led by a Director ([[Timmon Milne-Wallis|Tim Wallis]]) who has a [[PhD]] in [[Peace Studies]] and over 20 years management experience in the field.

==History==
Peaceworkers UK began as an independent research project in 2000 to explore the phenomenon of ‘civilian peace services’ being set up in at least six other European countries. In 2001, it functioned as the secretariat for a Steering Group of other UK-based organisations exploring the feasibility of a UK Civilian Peace Service. The Steering Group, consisting of the organisations listed above, decided in 2002 to set up Peaceworkers UK as an independent entity to pursue these objectives.

==Peaceworker programme==
* Assists organisations to recruit and deploy the best people and expanding the pool of those available for this work through the  PeaceworkersRegister.
* Runs practical, hands-on training courses to help people reach the high standards they need through the PeaceworkersTraining programme.
* Develops and improves those standards and assesses people’s suitability for this work through PeaceworkersSimulations.
* Underpins all this with the latest PeaceworkersResearch into best practices and lessons learned from the field.

===PeaceworkersRegister===
The PeaceworkersRegister is an international database of people suitably qualified and potentially available for a wide range of roles needed in conflict prevention, [[crisis management]] and peacebuilding. Its primary purpose is to help both local and international organisations to find and deploy the best people meeting the highest standards of professional competence in their particular field. As a professional development tool, it also helps those who join it to identify and improve their own skills and qualifications.

===PeaceworkersTraining===
The PeaceworkersTraining programme offers practical, field-based training to prepare people for the many different roles they may play in this field. There are introductory and core skill courses as well as specialised courses in [[human rights]], conflict transformation, human security, and civil society capacity-building. Some of the more specialist courses are run under the auspices of the EU Training Project in Civilian Crisis Management.

===PeaceworkersSimulations===
PeaceworkersSimulations provide a means to assess people against commonly agreed minimum standards of professional competence. Observing people’s responses under simulated field conditions provides the basis for assessments at five levels of competency across a wide range of fieldwork categories.

===PeaceworkersResearch===
The aim of PeaceworkersResearch is to establish a body of knowledge about what has or has not "worked" in different situations of violent conflict. Research activities include field-based personnel assessments and surveys as well as in-house data analysis, tapping into a comprehensive network of individuals and organisations in the field. Why best placed: Peaceworkers UK is best placed to do this work because it has been developing this integrated programme of recruitment, training and assessment for the past five years and has built up an unparalleled understanding of the personal qualities, skills and knowledge needed to work effectively across a range of work categories in this field. It has already begun developing and obtaining wide agreement on a set of appropriate occupational standards together with a tried and tested methodology for training and assessing people against those standards. It has the capacity, the human resources and the know-how to achieve these objectives and is in the strongest possible position to help governments, [[United Nations]] agencies and [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) to make a real difference to the lives of millions unable to escape the causes and consequences of violent conflict in so many parts of the world.

==Partners==
Alert's PeaceworkersUK works with a wide range of partners in the UK and Europe as well as in the rest of the world. Our closest UK partners are [[Saferworld]], Electoral Reform International Services (ERIS), and [[RedR]]. As a member of the [[Peace &amp; Security Liaison Group]] we also work closely with a number of other UK-based organisations working for the prevention, management and resolution of violent conflict around the world.

As a member of the [[European Network of Civil Peace Services]], PWUK also works closely with partner organisations sharing similar aims in ten other European countries. We have partnerships with organisations working directly on their own situations of violent conflict or its aftermath in [[Chechnya]], [[Moldova]], [[Turkey]], [[Croatia]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Outside Europe, PWUK has a special link with the 93 member organisations of the [[Nonviolent Peaceforce]] as well as with a few specific organisations with which we have worked in [[Nepal]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Nigeria]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Zimbabwe]].

[[File:Gorn-1922.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Gorn'' (Furnace), an official organ of Proletkult]]
'''Proletkult''' ({{lang-rus|Пролетку́льт|p=prəlʲɪtˈkulʲt}}), a [[portmanteau]] of the Russian words "proletarskaya kultura" ([[proletarian culture]]), was an experimental Soviet artistic institution that arose in conjunction with the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917. This organization, a federation of local cultural societies and [[avant-garde]] artists, was most prominent in the visual, literary, and [[drama]]tic fields. Proletkult aspired to radically modify existing artistic forms by creating a new, revolutionary [[working class|working-class]] aesthetic, which drew its inspiration from the construction of modern industrial society in backward, agrarian Russia.

Although funded by the [[People's Commissariat for Education]] of [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]], the Proletkult organization sought autonomy from state control, a demand which brought it into conflict with the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] hierarchy and the Soviet state bureaucracy. Some top party leaders, such as [[V.I. Lenin]], sought to concentrate state funding on the basic education of the working class rather than on whimsical artistic endeavors. He and others also saw in Proletkult a hotbed of [[bourgeois]] intellectuals and potential political oppositionists.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

At its peak in 1920, Proletkult had 84,000 members actively enrolled in about 300 local studios, clubs, and factory groups, with an additional 500,000 members participating in its activities on a more casual basis.

== History ==

=== Factional background ===
[[File:A A Bogdanov.jpg|thumb|[[Bolshevik]] philosopher [[Alexander Bogdanov]], one of the founding fathers of the Proletkult movement]]

The earliest roots of the Proletarian Culture movement, better known as Proletkult, are found in the aftermath of the failed [[Revolution of 1905|1905-1907 Revolution]] against [[Nicholas II of Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Mally, ''Culture of the Future: The Proletkult Movement in Revolutionary Russia.'' Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1990; pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[censorship]] apparatus of the Tsarist regime had stumbled briefly during the upheaval, broadening horizons, but the revolution had ultimately failed, resulting in dissatisfaction and second-guessing, even within [[Bolshevik Party]] ranks.

In the aftermath of the Tsar's reassertion of authority a radical political tendency known as the "[[Left Bolsheviks]]" emerged, stating their case in opposition to party leader [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].&lt;ref name=Mally4&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  This group, which included such luminaries as philosophers [[Alexander Bogdanov]] and [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]] and writer [[Maxim Gorky]], argued that the [[intelligentsia]]-dominated Bolsheviks must begin following more inclusive tactics and working to develop more [[working class]] political activists to assume leadership roles in the next round of anti-Tsarist revolution.&lt;ref name=Mally4 /&gt;

Among the Left Bolsheviks, Anatoly Lunacharsky in particular had been intrigued with the possibility of making use of art as a means to inspire revolutionary political action.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, together with the celebrated Gorky, Lunacharsky hoped to found a "human religion" around the idea of [[socialism]], motivating individuals to serve a greater good outside of their own narrow self-interests.&lt;ref name=Mally5&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Working along similar lines simultaneously was Lunacharsky's brother-in-law Bogdanov, who even in 1904 had published a weighty philosophical tome called ''Empiriomonism'' which attempted to integrate the ideas of non-Marxist thinkers [[Ernst Mach]] and [[Richard Avenarius]] into the socialist edifice.&lt;ref name=Mally5 /&gt;  (Lunacharsky had studied under Avenarius in Zurich and was responsible for introducing Bogdanov to his ideas.)  Bogdanov believed that the socialist society of the future would require forging a fundamentally new perspective of the role of science, ethics, and art with respect to the individual and the state.&lt;ref name=Mally5 /&gt;

Together all these ideas of Bogdanov, Lunacharsky, Gorky, and their co-thinkers came to be known in the language of the day as "god-building" ''(bogostroitel'stvo).''&lt;ref name=Mally5 /&gt;

These ideas did not exist in a vacuum; there was a political component as well. During the period between the failure of the 1905 revolution and the outbreak of [[World War I]], Alexander Bogdanov stood as the chief rival to Lenin for leadership of the Bolshevik party.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks: Lenin and His Critics.'' Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1986; pg. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the intellectually rigid Lenin, Bogdanov was not only a political rival, but also a positive threat to the [[ideology]] of [[Marxism]]. Lenin saw Bogdanov and the "god-building" movement with which he was associated as purveyors of a reborn [[Idealism|philosophical idealism]] that stood in diametrical opposition to the fundamental [[materialism|materialist]] foundation of Marxism. So disturbed was Lenin that he spent much of 1908 combing more than 200 books to pen a thick polemical volume in reply — ''[[Materialism and Empirio-criticism|Materialism and Empirio-Criticism: Critical Comments on a Reactionary Philosophy]].''&lt;ref&gt;For ''Materialism and Empirio-Criticism,'' see: V.I. Lenin, ''Collected Works: Volume 14.'' Abraham Fineberg, trans. Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1962; pp. 17-361. Details of Lenin's writing process may be found in the same volume, page 366, footnote 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lenin ultimately emerged triumphant in the struggle for hegemony of the Bolshevik faction. Relations between them in Western European exile remained tense. During the first decade of the 20th Century Bogdanov wrote two works of [[utopianism|utopian]] [[science fiction]] about socialist societies on [[Mars]], both of which were rejected by Lenin as attempts to smuggle "Machist idealism" into the radical movement.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks,'' pp. 169-170.&lt;/ref&gt; The second of these, a book called ''Engineer Menni'' (1913), was pronounced by Lenin to be "so vague that neither a worker nor a stupid editor at ''Pravda'' [a rival publication] could understand it."&lt;ref name=Williams170&gt;Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks,'' pg. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 Bogdanov, a student of the [[Scientific management|Taylor system]] of factory work-flow rationalization, published a massive work on the topic, ''General Organizational Science,'' which Lenin liked no better.&lt;ref name="Williams170"/&gt;

The pair went their separate ways, with Bogdanov dropping out of radical politics at the end of 1913, returning home with his wife to [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''The Other Bolsheviks,'' pg. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; He would later be reinvigorated by the course of events to become a leading figure in the Moscow Proletkult organization — a fact which emphasizes the tension between that organization and state authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Mally argues that this traditional emphasis on Alexander Bogdanov as the "best known leader" of Proletkult helps obscure the fact that Proletkult's ongoing battle for "autonomy" ''(samostoiatel'nost')'' was in essence a fight with the state bureaucracy rather than the Communist Party, per se. See: Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The birth of Proletkult===
[[File:Moscow SpiridonovkaStreet Morozova Palace 01-2017.jpg|thumb|right|Morozova Palace, home of Proletkult]]
====Preliminary conference====
[[File:Anatoly Lunacharsky.jpg|thumb|left|Anatoly Lunacharsky, a founding father of the Proletkult organization, was People's Commissar of Education of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1929.]]

The [[February Revolution|February Revolution of 1917]] which overthrew the Tsarist regime came comparatively easily. So, too, did the [[October Revolution]] which followed, events which overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government]] of [[Alexander Kerensky]] and brought Lenin and the Bolsheviks to the seat of power. The [[Russian Civil War]] was another matter altogether — a long and brutal struggle which strained every sinew.

The radical intelligentsia of Russia was mobilized by these events. Anatoly Lunacharsky, who had briefly broken with Lenin and the Bolshevik Party to become a [[newspaper correspondent]] in [[France]] and [[Italy]], returned to Russia in May 1917 and rejoined the party in August.&lt;ref name=Fitz310&gt;Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment: Soviet Organization of Education and the Arts under Lunacharsky.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1970; pg. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the October Revolution, Lunacharsky was appointed Commissar of Education of the new regime.&lt;ref name=Fitz310 /&gt;

Lunacharsky's factional ally, Alexander Bogdanov, remained sharply critical of Lenin and his political tactics and never rejoined the Communist Party, however.&lt;ref name=Fitz295&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he served at the front as a doctor during World War I, returning home to Moscow in 1917 and becoming involved there as a founder of the Proletarian Culture organization, Proletkult.&lt;ref name=Fitz295 /&gt;

The aim of unifying the cultural and educational activities of the Russian labour movements first occurred at the Agitation Collegium of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet which met on 19 July 1917 with 120 participants. It was attended by many different currents, and when the [[Menshevik]] Dementiev suggested that the meeting just be confined to public lectures and that the [[Bolsheviks]] should be excluded, but this was soundly rejected. Consequently, the Central Council of [[Factory committee|Factory Committee]]s was instructed to work with the [[Petrograd Soviet]] to organise a second conference of "proletarian cultural-educational organizations" to bring them together in a centralized organization.&lt;ref name=Fitz89&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; A first conference of these groups was held in [[Petrograd]] from October 16 to 19, 1917 &lt;small&gt;(O.S.)&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name=Fitz89 /&gt; The conclave was called by Lunacharsky in his role as head of the Cultural-Educational Commission of the Petrograd Bolshevik organization and was attended by 208 delegates representing Petrograd trade unions, factory committees, army and youth groups, city and regional dumas, as well as the Petrograd Committee of the Bolshevik and [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Socialist-Revolutionary]] parties.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pp. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

This October 1917 conference elected a Central Committee of Proletarian Cultural-Educational Organizations of Petrograd which included among its members Lunacharsky, Lenin's wife [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]], talented young journalist [[Larisa Reisner]], and a long-time [[Vpered]] associate of Bogdanov and Lunacharsky named [[Fedor Kalinin]], among others.&lt;ref name=Fitz90&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Also playing a key role was [[Pavel Lebedev-Polianskii]], another former member of Bogdanov and Lunacharsky's émigré political group.&lt;ref name=Fitz306&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these would be catapulted into leading roles in the People's Commissariat of Education following the Bolshevik seizure of power which followed less than two weeks later.&lt;ref name=Fitz90 /&gt;

====After the Bolshevik seizure of state power====

The October Revolution led to a marked increase in the number of new cultural organizations and informal groups.&lt;ref name=Mally33&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Clubs and cultural societies sprung up affiliated with newly empowered factories, unions, cooperatives, and [[soviet (council)|workers' and soldiers' councils]], in addition to similar groups attached to more formal institutions such as the [[Red Army]], the Communist Party, and [[Komsomol|its youth section]].&lt;ref name=Mally33 /&gt; The new government of Soviet Russia was quick to understand that these rapidly proliferating clubs and societies offered a potentially powerful vehicle for the spread of the radical political, economic, and social theories it favored.&lt;ref name=Mally33 /&gt;

The chief cultural authority of the Soviet state was its People's Commissariat of Education ([[Narkompros]]), a bureaucratic apparatus which quickly came to include no fewer than 17 different departments.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Headed by Anatoly Lunacharsky, this organization sought to expand adult literacy and to establish a broad and balanced general school curricula, in opposition to pressure from the trade unions and the [[Supreme Council of National Economy]], which sought to give preference to [[vocational education]].&lt;ref name=Mally35&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The as-yet loosely organized Proletkult movement emerged as another potential competitor to the primacy of Narkompros.

This confusing welter of competing institutions and organizations was by no means unique to the cultural field, as historian Lynn Mally has noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"All early Soviet institutions struggled against what was called 'parallelism,' the duplication of services by competing bureaucratic systems. The revolution raised difficult questions about governmental organization that were only slowly answered during the first years of the regime. Political activists disputed the authority of the central state, the role of the Communist Party within it, and the influence national agencies should wield over local groups. Altercations over scarce resources and institutional authority were intertwined with theoretical debates over the ideal structure of the new policy."&lt;ref name=Mally34&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, in the early revolutionary period control over local institutions by the central government of the Soviet state was weak, with factory workers often ignoring their trade unions and teachers the curriculum instructions of central authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt; In this political environment any centrally-devised scheme for a division of authority between Narkompros and the federated artistic societies of Proletkult remained largely a theoretical exercise. In the early days of the Bolshevik regime the local apparatus of Proletkult retained the most powerful hand.&lt;ref name=Mally36&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With its adherent Anatoly Lunacharsky at the helm of Narkompros, the Proletkult movement had an important patron with considerable influence over state policy and the purse. This did not mean an easy relationship between these institutions, however. Early in 1918 leaders of Petrograd Proletkult refused to cooperate with an effort by Narkompros to form a citywide theatre organization, declaring their refusal to work with non-proletarian theatre groups.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moscow Proletkult, in which Alexander Bogdanov played a leading role, attempted to extend its independent sphere of control even further than the Petrograd organization, addressing questions of food distribution, hygiene, vocational education, and issuing a call for establishment of a proletarian university at its founding convention in February 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Some hardliners in the Proletkult organization even insisted that Proletkult be recognized as the "ideological leader of all public education and enlightenment."&lt;ref&gt;Vasilii Ignatov, writing in ''Griadushchee'' (The Future) 1918, no. 4 (April 1918), pg. 15. Quoted in Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, however, the vision of Proletkult as the rival and guiding light of Narkompros fell by the wayside, subdued by the Proletkult's financial reliance on the Commissariat for operational funding.&lt;ref name=Mally44&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Proletkult received a budget of 9.2 million gold rubles for the first half of 1918 — nearly one-third of the entire budget for Narkompros's Adult Educational Division.&lt;ref name=Mally44 /&gt; Requisitioned buildings were put to the organization's use, with the Petrograd organization receiving a large and posh facility located on one of the city's main thoroughfares, [[Nevsky Prospect]] — the name of which was actually changed to "Proletkult Street" ''(Ulitsa Proletkul'ta)'' in the organization's honor.&lt;ref name=Mally44 /&gt;

===Development===
[[File:Plakat mayakowski gross.jpg|thumb|The poet as graphic artist: "proletarian art" in a civil war era poster by the [[Russian futurism|futurist]] poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], published by Narkompros. Mayakovsky makes use of stencil, simple agitational poetry, and primitive workerist graphics to create an almost [[folk art]] effect.]]

While the Proletkult movement began as independent groups in Petrograd (October 1917) and Moscow (February 1918), it was not long before the group's patrons in the Soviet state intervened to help forge a national organization.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet government itself moved from Petrograd to Moscow in March 1918 and the center of Proletkult's own organizational gravity shifted simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Mally45&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lines became blurred between the Proletkult organization and the Division for Proletarian Culture of the People's Commissariat of Education, headed by Proletkult activist Fyodor Kalinin.&lt;ref name=Mally45 /&gt; While the organization retained its staunch supporters in the Narkompros apparatus seeking to coordinate activities, it also contained no small number of activists like Alexander Bogdanov who tried to promote the organization as an independent cultural institution with a homogeneous working class constituency.&lt;ref name=Mally45 /&gt;

In September 1918 the first national conference of Proletkult was convened in Moscow, including 330 delegates and 234 guests from local organizations from around Soviet Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; While no delegate list has survived, the stenogram of the conference indicates that the bulk of attendees hailed from trade unions, factory organizations, cooperatives, and workers' clubs.&lt;ref name=Mally46&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates were split between those favoring an autonomous and leading role for the organization in general education in Soviet society and those who favored a more narrow focus for the group as a subordinate part of the Narkompros bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

While those favoring autonomy were in the majority at the first national conference, the ongoing problem of organizational finance remained a real one, as historian Lynn Mally has observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Although the Proletkult was autonomous, it still expected Narkompros to foot the bills. The government would supply the central Proletkult with a subsidy, to be distributed among provincial affiliates. But because financial dependence on the state clearly contradicted the organization's claims to independence, the central leaders held out the hope that their affiliates would soon discover their own means of support."&lt;ref name=Mally48&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proletkult and its desire for autonomy also had another powerful patron in the person of [[Nikolai Bukharin]], editor of ''[[Pravda]].''&lt;ref name=Fitz94&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Bukharin provided favorable coverage for Proletkult during the organization's formative period, welcoming the idea that the group represented a "laboratory of pure proletarian ideology" with a legitimate claim to independence from Soviet governmental control.&lt;ref name=Fitz94 /&gt;

Proletkult made use of different organizational forms. In large industrial cities, the organization set up an elaborate bureaucratic apparatus resembling that of Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Fitz98&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow Proletkult, for example, had departments for literary publishing, theatre, music, art, and clubs.&lt;ref name=Fitz98 /&gt; In addition to this central bureaucracy, Proletkult established factory cells attached to the highly concentrated mills and manufacturing facilities.&lt;ref name=Fitz98 /&gt; Finally, Proletkult established "studios" — independent facilities in which workers learned and developed the techniques of the various arts.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narkompros, for its part, sought to influence Proletkult to concentrate its efforts upon the expansion of the network of studios.&lt;ref name=Fitz99&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1919 People's Commissar of Education Lunacharsky declared that Proletkult "should concentrate all its attention on studio work, on the discovery and encouragement of original talent among the workers, on the creation of circles of writers, artists, and all kinds of young scholars from the working class..."&lt;ref&gt;A. Lunacharsky, "Once Again on Proletkult and Soviet Cultural Organizations," ''Izvestiia VTsIK,'' No. 80 (April 13, 1919), pg. 2. Quoted in Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proletkult and its studios and clubs gained a certain measure of popularity among a broad segment of the urban Russian population, particularly factory workers.&lt;ref name=Siegelbaum&gt;Lewis H. Siegelbaum, ''Soviet State and Society Between Revolutions, 1918-1929.'' Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1992; pg. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1918 the organization counted 147 local affiliates, although the actual number of functioning units was probably somewhat fewer.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 51. See especially footnote 57 on that page.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the peak of the organization's strength in 1920, Proletkult claimed a total of 84,000 members in 300 local groups, with an additional 500,000 more casual followers.&lt;ref&gt;Siegelbaum, ''Soviet State and Society Between Revolutions, 1918-1929,'' pp. 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 15 different Proletkult periodicals were produced over the course of the organization's short existence,&lt;ref name=Maguire157&gt;Robert A. Maguire, ''Red Virgin Soil: Soviet Literature in the 1920s.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1968; pg. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; including most importantly ''Proletarskaia kultura'' (Proletarian Culture — 1918 to 1921) and ''Gorn'' (Furnace — 1918 to 1923).&lt;ref&gt;[http://feb-web.ru/feb/litenc/encyclop/le9/le9-5192.htm "Пролеткульт,"] (Proletkult). Fundamental Electronic Library of Russian Literature and Folklore, feb-web.ru/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideology===

Historically the relationship between the Russian liberal [[intelligentsia]] and the working class was that of teacher and student.&lt;ref name=CultFront19&gt;Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''The Cultural Front: Power and Culture in Revolutionary Russia.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1992; pg. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; This situation presumed a "higher" level of culture on the part of the aristocratic teachers — an accepted premise of the Bolsheviks themselves during the pre-revolutionary period.&lt;ref name=CultFront19 /&gt;

Under Marxist theory, however, culture was conceived as a part of the [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] associated with the dominant class in society — in the Russian instance, that of the [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref name=CultFront20&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Cultural Front,'' pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Under a workers' state, some [[theoretician (Marxism)|Marxist theoreticians]] believed, the new proletarian ruling class would develop its own distinct class culture to supplant the former culture of the old ruling order.&lt;ref name=CultFront20 /&gt; Proletkult was seen as a primary vehicle for the development of this new "proletarian culture."

The nature and function of Proletkult was described by [[Platon Kerzhentsev]], one of the movement's top leaders in 1919:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The task of the 'Proletkults' is the development of an independent proletarian spiritual culture, including all areas of the human spirit — science, art, and everyday life. The new socialist epoch must produce a new culture, the foundations of which are already being laid. This culture will be the fruit of the creative efforts of the working class and will be entirely independent. Work on behalf of proletarian culture should stand on a par with the political and economic struggle of the working class.

"But in creating its own culture, the working class by no means should reject the rich cultural heritage of the past, the material and spiritual achievements, made by classes which are alien and hostile to the proletariat. The proletarian must look it over critically, choose what is of value, elucidate it with his own point of view, use it with a view to producing his own culture. *  *  *

"This work on a new culture ought to proceed along a completely independent path. 'Proletkults' should be class-restricted, workers' organizations, completely autonomous in their activities."&lt;ref&gt;V. Kerzhentsev, ''Oktiabr'skii perevorot i diktatura proletariata'' (The October Overturn and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat). Moscow: 1919;  pp. 154-161. Reprinted in William G. Rosenberg (ed.), ''Bolshevik Visions: First Phase of the Cultural Revolution in Soviet Russia.'' Second Edition. Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 1990; pp. 80-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proletkult's theorists generally espoused a hardline [[economic determinism]], arguing that only purely working class organizations were capable of advancing the cause of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; An early editorial from the official Proletkult journal ''Proletarskaia Kultura'' (Proletarian Culture) demanded that "the proletariat start right now, immediately, to create its own ''socialist forms of thought, feeling, and daily life,'' independent of alliances or combinations of political forces."&lt;ref&gt;"From the Editors," ''Proletarskaia Kul'tura,'' 1918, no. 3 (March 1918), pg. 36. Emphasis in original. Quoted in Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of Alexander Bogdanov and other Proletkult theoreticians, the arts were not the province of a specially gifted elite, but rather were the physical output of individuals with a set of learned skills.&lt;ref name=Maguire157 /&gt; All that was required, it was assumed, was for one to study basic artistic technique in a very few lessons, after which anyone was capable of becoming a proletarian artist.&lt;ref name=Maguire157 /&gt; The movement by Proletkult to establish a network of studios in which workers could enroll was seen as an essential part of training this new cohort of proletarian artists.&lt;ref name=Maguire157 /&gt;

Despite the organization's rhetoric about its proletarian exclusivity, however, the movement was guided by intellectuals throughout its entire brief history, with its efforts to promote workers from the bench to leadership positions largely unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Siegelbaum, ''Soviet State and Society Between Revolutions, 1918-1929,'' pg. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on the various arts===

====Literature====

Proletkult expended great energy in attempting to launch a wave of worker-poets, with only limited artistic success. The insistence upon developing new poets of questionable talent led to a split of the Proletkult in 1919, when a large group of young writers, most of whom were poets, broke from the organization due to what they believed to be a stifling of individual creative talent.&lt;ref name=Maguire158&gt;Maguire, ''Red Virgin Soil,'' pg. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

These defectors from Proletkult initially formed a small, elite organization called Kuznitza (The Forge) before again launching a new [[mass organization]] known as the [[All-Russian Association of Proletarian Writers]] (VAPP) a year later.&lt;ref name=Maguire158 /&gt;

====Theater====
{{main|Proletcult Theatre}}
The Proletkult organizations of Petrograd and Moscow controlled their own dramatic theatrical network, including under its umbrella a number of smaller city clubs maintaining their own theatrical studios.&lt;ref name=Acts31&gt;Lynn Mally, ''Revolutionary Acts: Amateur Theater and the Soviet State, 1917-1938.'' Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2000; pg. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrograd Proletkult opened a large central studio early in 1918 which staged a number of new and experimental works with a view to inspiring similar performances in other amateur theaters around the city.&lt;ref name=Acts31 /&gt; Moscow Proletkult opened its own central theater several months later.&lt;ref name=Acts31 /&gt;

Proletkult constituted the leading center of a radical minority within the theatrical community of the day which aspired to promote so-called "proletarian theater."&lt;ref name=Acts22&gt;Mally, ''Revolutionary Acts,'' pg. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Development of this new form was defined in one early conference resolution as "the task of workers themselves, along with those peasants who are willing to accept their ideology."&lt;ref name=Acts22 /&gt; Conventional modes of performance were discouraged, in favor of unconventional stagings designed to promote "mass action" — including public processions, festivals, and social dramas.&lt;ref name=Acts22 /&gt;

===Contemporary criticism===

Artists in the Proletkult movement, while not by any means a homogeneous bloc, were influenced to a great extent by the [[iconoclasm]], technological orientation, and revolutionary enthusiasm bound up in the thematic movements of the day, [[Russian futurism|futurism]] and [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]].&lt;ref name=Fitz100&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite lip service paid to classical forms of poetry, drama, writing, sculpture, and painting, strong encouragement was given to the use of new techniques and forms in so-called "proletarian art," including the use of photography, cinematography, and collage.&lt;ref name=Fitz100 /&gt;

This commitment to experimentalism drew the fire of those party leaders who preferred more classical modes of artistic expression. Petrograd Communist Party leader [[Grigory Zinoviev]]  took the lead at a conference of "proletarian writers" held in that city in the fall of 1919, declaring that while previously "we allowed the most nonsensical futurism to get a reputation almost as the official school of Communist art" and let "doubtful elements attach themselves to our Proletkults."&lt;ref name=Zin&gt;Quoted in Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; it was henceforth "time to put an end to this," Zinoviev demanded.&lt;ref name=Zin /&gt;

Also among those critical of the Proletkult movement and its vision to create a wholly new proletarian culture was top Soviet party leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]. At a public speech in May 1919 Lenin declared any notions of so-called "proletarian culture" to be "fantasies" which he opposed with "ruthless hostility."&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Lenin, ''Polnoe sobranie sochineniia: Tom 38, Mart—Iiun' 1919.'' Moscow: Politizdat, 1969; pp. 368-369. Quoted in Fitzpatrick, ''The Commissariat of Enlightenment,'' pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, Lenin had profound misgivings about the entire institution of Proletkult, viewing it as (in historian [[Sheila Fitzpatrick|Sheila Fitzpatrick's]] words) "an organization where futurists, idealists, and other undesirable bourgeois artists and intellectuals addled the minds of workers who needed basic education and culture..."&lt;ref name=CultFront22&gt;Fitzpatrick, ''The Cultural Front,'' pg. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin also may have had political misgivings about the organization as a potential base of power for his long-time rival [[Alexander Bogdanov]] or for ultra-radical [[Left communism|"Left Communists"]] and the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] dissidents who comprised the [[Workers' Opposition]].&lt;ref name=CultFront22 /&gt;

===Dissolution===
[[File:Vintage Potemkin.jpg|thumb|The ethic of Proletkult is found in the early cinematic works of Sergei Eisenstein. This promotional poster for his 1926 film ''The Battleship Potemkin'' making use of indistinct masses of people and diagonal lines is exemplary of [[constructivism (art)|constructivism]].]]

By the fall of 1920 it became increasingly clear that the Soviet regime would emerge from the Russian Civil War victorious. With fall of the [[White movement|Whites]], a common enemy which united disparate factions around the Soviet banner, much unity was loosened. Dissident groups such as the so-called Workers' Opposition and the [[Group of Democratic Centralism|Democratic Centralists]] emerged in the Communist Party, widespread dissatisfaction among the [[peasantry]] over forced grain requisitioning resulted in isolated uprisings. All of these factors prompted a wave of debate about the institutions that had sprung up in Soviet society during wartime, including Proletkult.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its short history, Proletkult had sought both autonomy from state control and hegemony in the cultural field. This had created a substantial number of critics and rivals. These included leaders of the Soviet trade union movement, who saw the management of workers' cultural opportunities as part of their own purview; local Communist Party committees, which sought centralization under their own direction rather than a hode-podge of autonomous civic institutions; and the People's Commissariat of Education (Narkompros), which believed its own mission included the cultural training of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 196-197.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, Narkompros proved the most outspoken and unyielding in its criticism.&lt;ref name=Mally197&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since 1918 [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]] — the wife of Vladimir Lenin — had sought to reign in Proletkult and integrate it under the agency in which she herself played a leading role, the Adult Education Division of Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Mally197 /&gt; A May 1919 conference of adult education workers had, spurred on by Krupskaya, determined that Proletkult was an adult education agency owing to its studio system, and therefore rightfully part of Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Mally197 /&gt;

Bureaucratic wrangling between top leaders of Proletkult and the Adult Education Division of Narkompros had produced a working agreement in the summer of 1919 bringing Proletkult formally under the auspices of the latter, albeit with its own separate budget.&lt;ref name=Mally198&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; This proved, however, to be a stop-gap and institutional conflict remained.&lt;ref name=Mally198 /&gt;

Proletkult leaders subsequently made an effort to expand their movement on an international basis at the [[2nd World Congress of the Comintern|2nd World Congress of the Communist International]] in August 1920, founding [[Kultintern]], an international organization headed by Anatoly Lunacharsky.&lt;ref name=Mally200&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; The group's grandiose vision and practical efforts to expand the Proletkult movement globally was particularly concerning to Lenin, himself a man of staid and traditional cultural tastes who had already come to see Proletkult as utopian and wasteful.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 199, 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spurred to action by Lenin, in the fall of 1920 the governing Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) &lt;!---this is the correct name and capitalization for the organization---&gt; began to take an active interest in the relationship of Proletkult with other Soviet institutions for the first time.&lt;ref name=Mally198 /&gt; Lenin sought and obtained information from [[M. N. Pokrovsky|M.N. Pokrovsky]], second in command at Narkompros, and top Proletkult leaders about the organization's budget and semi-independent status and pushed through a decision to absorb Proletkult into Narkompros to end the situation of parallelism once and for all.&lt;ref name=Mally201&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

The already scheduled National Congress of Proletkult, held in Moscow from October 5 to 12, 1920, was to be the occasion for the announcement.&lt;ref name=Mally201 /&gt; While Lunacharsky, head of Narkompros but a patron of Proletkult and its interests, dragged his feet on the merger, the congress eventually — following long debate and a stern appeal to party discipline — formally approved the Central Committee's decision to directly integrate Proletkult into Narkompros.&lt;ref&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pp. 201-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The integration was not a smooth one, however, and Proletkult activists fought to the last ditch to retain organizational autonomy even within Narkompros.&lt;ref name=Mally203&gt;Mally, ''Culture of the Future,'' pg. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Committee reacted with a scathing decree denouncing Proletkult that was published in ''Pravda'' on December 1, 1920.

===Legacy===

Despite its formal termination as an organization, the Proletkult movement continued to influence and inform early Soviet culture. Historian Peter Kenez has noted the heavy influence of the Proletkult ethic in the work of pioneer Soviet filmmaker [[Sergei Eisenstein]], director of the classic films ''[[Strike (1925 film)|Strike]]'' (1925), ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' (1926), and ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World]]'' (1927):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The intellectual content of [Eisenstein's] early films was profoundly influenced by his earlier association with Proletkult, a complex politicocultural movement that reached the height of its influence during the revolutionary period.... [Its leaders] argued that the new, socialist culture would be profoundly different from what it replaced. In their view there could be no accommodation with the old world; the proletariat on the basis of its experience would create a new culture that would reflect the spirit of the collective. It followed that the new art had to emphasize not the accomplishments of individuals but those of the workers and peasants. Eisenstein was attracted to this movement because it justified the necessity of a complete break with the art of the '[[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]' world. All of his early films expressed, though in his own idiom, the ideology of Proletkult."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kenez, ''Cinema and Soviet Society, 1917-1953.'' New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992; pg. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Qashani''' or '''Kashani''' is a [[Persian Empire|Persian]] decorative arts which had been popular in [[Iran]] in the 16th to 18th century, and then moved to [[Turkey]] in the time of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] with the transfer of many Persians artists to Turkey, becoming the basis for decorating the walls of [[mosque]]s, palaces, shrines and tombs. It is a square-shaped ceramic tile which uses Persian-like floral-depicting 4- or 6-sided glazed tiles, decorated with blue, cyan, green and sometimes red colors. The decoration is surrounded by fine black lines that make it stand out on its white floor. The tile work had often been decorated by the inscription, floral and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometrical pattern]]s. The inscription often provides [[Qur'an]]ic verses or sentences related to historical events written in Persian script. The plant often consists of natural flowers such as lily, cloves, roses and cypress trees. Geometrical patterns consists of different geometrical shapes and polygons. In [[Morocco]], similar artistic technique is known as [[zellige|''zillij'']]. Its use has been widespread in the decoration of the walls of the buildings in the Ottoman era, and this mosaical feature can also be seen in the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Kashi, the abbreviated form of Qashani, was also introduced to [[Sindh]], [[Kutch]], and [[Multan]] where numerous examples of shrines and mosques embellished with blue, white and green tile work exist.&lt;ref&gt; Leadless Decorative Tiles, Faience, and Mosaic: 
William James Furnival - 1904 - This style of decoration is called Kashani, after Kashan in Persia, one of the chief seats of earthenware manufacture .&lt;/ref&gt;

'''reCAPTCHA''' is a [[CAPTCHA]]-like system designed to establish that a computer user is human (normally in order to protect websites from [[Internet bot|bots]]) and, at the same time, assist in the [[Digitizing|digitization]] of books. reCAPTCHA was originally developed by [[Luis von Ahn]], David Abraham, [[Manuel Blum]], Michael Crawford, Ben Maurer, Colin McMillen, and Edison Tan at [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon University's]] main [[Pittsburgh]] campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = reCAPTCHA: About Us|url=http://recaptcha.net/aboutus.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100611210259/http://recaptcha.net/aboutus.html|accessdate = 2018-08-14 | archive-date=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired by [[Google]] in September 2009.&lt;ref name="AutoK4-1" /&gt;

reCAPTCHA has completely digitized the archives of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and books from [[Google Books]], as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/science/29recaptcha.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=March 28, 2011|accessdate=November 20, 2017|title=Deciphering Old Texts, One Woozy, Curvy Word at a Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archive can be searched from the ''New York Times'' Article Archive, where more than 13&amp;nbsp;million articles in total have been archived, dating from 1851 to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/membercenter/nytarchive.html|title=New York Times Article Archive|date=2007-09-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through [[mass collaboration]], reCAPTCHA was helping to digitize books that are too illegible to be scanned by computers, as well as translate books to different languages, as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Massive-scale online collaboration|url = http://www.ted.com/talks/luis_von_ahn_massive_scale_online_collaboration.html|website = www.ted.com|accessdate = 2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system has been reported as displaying over 100&amp;nbsp;million CAPTCHAs every day,&lt;ref name="AutoK4-2" /&gt; on sites such as [[Facebook]], [[TicketMaster]], [[Twitter]], [[4chan]], [[CNN.com]], [[StumbleUpon]],&lt;ref name="BBCreport" /&gt; [[Craigslist]] (since June 2008),&lt;ref name="craig" /&gt; and the U.S. [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]]'s [[CECB|digital TV converter box]] coupon program website (as part of the [[DTV transition in the United States|US DTV transition]]).&lt;ref name="AutoK4-5" /&gt;

reCAPTCHA's slogan was "Stop Spam, Read Books.",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/recaptcha |title=reCAPTCHA: Stop Spam, Read Books |publisher=Google |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the introduction of a new version of the reCAPTCHA plugin in 2014 which is now changed to "Tough on Bots, Easy on Humans.";&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html|title=reCAPTCHA: Easy on Humans, Hard on Bots|website=www.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the slogan has now disappeared from the website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html |title=recaptcha |publisher=Google |accessdate=2015-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the classic version of the reCAPTCHA plugin. A new system featuring image verification was also introduced. In this system, users are asked to just click on a checkbox (the system will verify whether the user is a human or not, for example, with some clues such as already-known cookies or mouse movements within the ReCAPTCHA frame) or, if it fails, select one or more images from a selection of set of images.&lt;ref name="oneclick"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/12/google-one-click-recaptcha/|title=Google Can Now Tell You're Not a Robot with Just One Click|date=December 3, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2015|first=Andy|last=Greenberg|publisher=''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
[[Distributed Proofreaders]] was the first project to volunteer its time to decipher scanned text that could not be read by OCR. It works with [[Project Gutenberg]] to digitize [[public domain]] material and uses methods quite different from reCAPTCHA.

The reCAPTCHA program originated with [[Guatemala]]n [[computer scientist]] [[Luis von Ahn]],&lt;ref name="CBC2" /&gt; and was aided by a [[MacArthur Fellowship]]. An early CAPTCHA developer, he realized "he had unwittingly created a system that was frittering away, in ten-second increments, millions of hours of a most precious resource: human brain cycles".&lt;ref name="AutoK4-6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoK4-9" /&gt;

== Operation ==
[[File:Modern-captcha.jpg|thumb|290px|An example of how a reCAPTCHA challenge looked in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2007/09/16/recaptcha-using-captchas-to-digitize-books/|title=reCAPTCHA: Using Captchas To Digitize Books – TechCrunch|first=|last=Contributor|website=techcrunch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing the words "following finding". The waviness and horizontal stroke were added to increase the difficulty of breaking the CAPTCHA with a computer program.]]

Scanned text is subjected to analysis by two different [[optical character recognition]] programs. Their respective outputs are then aligned with each other by standard string-matching algorithms and compared both to each other and to an English dictionary. Any word that is deciphered differently by both OCR programs or that is not in the English dictionary is marked as "suspicious" and converted into a CAPTCHA. The suspicious word is displayed, out of context, sometimes along with a control word already known. If the human types the control word correctly, then the response to the questionable word is accepted as probably valid. If enough users were to correctly type the control word, but incorrectly type the second word which OCR had failed to recognize, then the digital version of documents could end up containing the incorrect word. The identification performed by each OCR program is given a value of 0.5 points, and each interpretation by a human is given a full point. Once a given identification hits 2.5 points, the word is considered valid. Those words that are consistently given a single identity by human judges are later recycled as control words.&lt;ref name="AutoK4-8" /&gt; If the first three guesses match each other but do not match either of the OCRs, they are considered a correct answer, and the word becomes a control word.&lt;ref name="Ahn, Ben Maurer 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Luis | first1 =  | last2 = Maurer | first2 = Ben | last3 = McMillen | first3 = Colin | last4 = Abraham | first4 = David | last5 = Blum | first5 = Manuel | year = 2008 | title = reCAPTCHA: Human-Based Character Recognition via Web Security Measures" (PDF) | url = | journal = Science | volume = 321 | issue = 5895| pages = 1465–1468 | doi = 10.1126/science.1160379 | pmid = 18703711 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When six users reject a word before any correct spelling is chosen, the word is discarded as unreadable.&lt;ref name="Ahn, Ben Maurer 2008" /&gt;

The original reCAPTCHA method was designed to show the questionable words separately, as out-of-context correction, rather than in use, such as within a phrase of five words from the original document.&lt;ref name="DM" /&gt; Also, the control word might mislead context for the second word, such as a request of "/metal/ /fife/" being entered as "metal file" due to the logical connection of filing with a metal tool being considered more common than the musical instrument "[[fife (instrument)|fife]]".{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In 2012, reCAPTCHA began using photographs of house numbers taken from Google's [[Street View]] project, in addition to scanned words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=March 29th, 2012 |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/29/google-now-using-recaptcha-to-decode-street-view-addresses/ |title=Google Now Using ReCAPTCHA To Decode Street View Addresses |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Images Recaptcha.png|thumb|right|200px|Image identification captcha]]
In 2014, reCAPTCHA implemented another system in which users are asked to select one or more images from a selection of nine images.&lt;ref name="oneclick" /&gt;

In 2017, reCAPTCHA was improved to require no interaction for most users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://digital-certification.com/blog/google-improves-their-captcha-with-no-user-interaction-required/|title=Digital Certification: The Digital Rating For Websites|last=Certification|first=Digital|date=2017-03-14|work=Digital Certification {{!}} Blog|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA ===
[[File:NoCAPTCHA reCAPTCHA.gif|thumb|The NoCAPTCHA reCAPTCHA]]
In 2013, reCAPTCHA began implementing [[behavioral analysis]] of the browser's interactions with the CAPTCHA to predict whether the user was a human or a bot before displaying the captcha, and presenting a "considerably more difficult" captcha in cases where it had reason to think the user might be a bot. By end of 2014 this mechanism started to be rolled out to most of the public Google services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/12/are-you-robot-introducing-no-captcha.html | title=Are you a robot? Introducing "No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA" | publisher=Google | date=2014-12-03 | accessdate=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because NoCAPTCHA relies on the use of Google cookies that are at least a few weeks old, reCAPTCHA has become nearly impossible to complete for people who frequently clear their cookies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 2017, Google improved this mechanism, calling it an "invisible reCAPTCHA". According to former Google "click fraud czar" [[Shuman Ghosemajumder]], this capability "creates a new sort of challenge that very advanced bots can still get around, but introduces a lot less friction to the legitimate human."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.popsci.com/google-invisible-recaptcha#page-3 | title=Google just made the internet a tiny bit less annoying | publisher=[[Popular Science]] | date=2017-03-10 | accessdate=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==
The reCAPTCHA tests are displayed from the central site of the reCAPTCHA project, which supplies the words to be deciphered.  This is done through a [[JavaScript]] [[Application programming interface|API]] with the server making a callback to reCAPTCHA after the request has been submitted.  The reCAPTCHA project provides libraries for various programming languages and applications to make this process easier.  reCAPTCHA is a gratis service (that is, the CAPTCHA images are provided to websites free of charge, in return for assistance with the decipherment),&lt;ref name="FAQ" /&gt; but the reCAPTCHA software itself is not [[open-source software|open-source]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/recaptcha|title=reCAPTCHA: Stop Spam, Read Books|publisher=Google|accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, reCAPTCHA offers plugins for several web-application platforms, like [[ASP.NET]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], or [[PHP]], to ease the implementation of the service.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/intro?csw=1|title=Developer's Guide – reCAPTCHA — Google Developers|publisher=Google|accessdate=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Some have criticized Google for using reCAPTCHA as a source of unpaid labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Massachusetts woman's lawsuit accuses Google of using free labor to transcribe books, newspapers|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/techflash/2015/01/massachusetts-womans-lawsuit-accuses-google-of.html|website=Boston Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; They say Google is unfairly using people around the world to help it transcribe books, addresses, and newspapers, and label image data for its driverless car effort without any compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google is Using You|url=https://hackernoon.com/google-is-using-you-recaptcha-hcaptcha-human-protocol-d911ff51a494|website=Hacker Noon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this criticism, competitors have emerged promising unique value propositions like compensating the website host or end-user for the work they do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=hCaptcha|url=https://hcaptcha.com|website=hCaptcha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of reCAPTCHA has been labelled "a serious barrier to internet use" for people with sight problems or disabilities such as dyslexia by BBC journalist Stephanie Hegarty.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18367017|title=BBC News – The evolution of those annoying online security tests|publisher=bbc.com|accessdate=2014-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

reCAPTCHA is also a barrier to Internet use in areas of the world where there is heavy Internet censorship and the underlying enabling sites are blocked.
 	
Software engineer Andrew Munsell, in his article "Captchas Are Becoming Ridiculous" states  "A couple of years ago, I don’t remember being truly baffled by a captcha. In fact, reCAPTCHA was one of the better systems I’d seen. It wasn’t difficult to solve, and it seemed to work when I used it on my own websites."  &lt;ref name="andrewmunsell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.andrewmunsell.com/blog/captchas-are-becoming-ridiculous|title=Captchas Are Becoming Ridiculous &amp;#124; Andrew Munsell|publisher=andrewmunsell.com|accessdate=2014-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2017}} Munsell goes on to state, after encountering a series of unintelligible images that despite refreshing "Again, and again, and again. The captchas were not only difficult for a computer to read, but impossible for a human." Munsell then provided numerous examples.

== Security ==
[[File:Recaptcha.png|thumb|An example of how reCAPTCHA challenges were presented in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/firewall/2010/06/18/those-scrambled-word-tests-for-stopping-spambots-are-tough-for-humans-too/|title=Those Scrambled Word Tests For Stopping Spambots Are Tough For Humans Too|first=The|last=Firewall|website=forbes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing the words "and chisels"]]

The main purpose of a [[CAPTCHA]] system is to prevent automated access to a system by computer programs or "bots". On 14 December 2009, Jonathan Wilkins released a paper describing weaknesses in reCAPTCHA that allowed a solve rate of 18%.&lt;ref name="Strong CAPTCHA Guidelines" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Register Article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="H-online Article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Google-s-reCAPTCHA-dented-888859.html |title=Google's reCAPTCHA dented}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2010, Chad Houck gave a presentation to the [[DEF CON]] 18 Hacking Conference detailing a method to reverse the distortion added to images which allowed a computer program to determine a valid response 10% of the time.&lt;ref name="Speaker Program" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Decoding reCAPTCHA" /&gt; The reCAPTCHA system was modified on 21 July 2010, before Houck was to speak on his method. Houck modified his method to what he described as an "easier" CAPTCHA to determine a valid response 31.8% of the time. Houck also mentioned security defenses in the system, including a high security lock out if an invalid response is given 32 times in a row.&lt;ref name="Decoding reCAPTCHA pptx" /&gt;

On 26 May 2012, Adam, C-P and Jeffball of DC949 gave a presentation at the LayerOne hacker conference detailing how they were able to achieve an automated solution with an accuracy rate of 99.1%.&lt;ref name="Project Stiltwalker"/&gt; Their tactic was to use techniques from machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, to analyse the audio version of reCAPTCHA which is available for the visually impaired. Google released a new version of reCAPTCHA just hours before their talk, making major changes to both the audio and visual versions of their service. In this release, the audio version was increased in length from 8 seconds to 30 seconds, and is much more difficult to understand, both for humans as well as bots. In response to this update and the following one, the members of DC949 released two more versions of Stiltwalker which beat reCAPTCHA with an accuracy of 60.95% and 59.4% respectively. After each successive break, Google updated reCAPTCHA within a few days. According to DC949, they often reverted to features that had been previously hacked.

On 27 June 2012, Claudia Cruz, Fernando Uceda, and Leobardo Reyes (a group of students from Mexico) published a paper showing a system running on reCAPTCHA images with an accuracy of 82%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pattern Recognition|volume=7329|date=30 June 2012|location=México|isbn=978-3-642-31148-2|pages=155–165|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-31149-9_16 |author1=Claudia Cruz-Perez|author3=Fernando Uceda-Ponga|author5= Leobardo Reyes-Cabrera|author2=Oleg Starostenko|author4=Vicente Alarcon-Aquino
|editor=Carrasco-Ochoa, Jesús Ariel |editor2=Martínez-Trinidad, José Francisco |editor3=Olvera López, José Arturo |editor4=Boyer, Kim L|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-31149-9_16|chapter=Breaking reCAPTCHAs with Unpredictable Collapse: Heuristic Character Segmentation and Recognition|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors have not said if their system can solve recent reCAPTCHA images, although they claim their work to be [[Intelligent character recognition|intelligent OCR]] and robust to some, if not all changes in the image database.

In an August 2012 presentation given at BsidesLV 2012, DC949 called the latest version "unfathomably impossible for humans"&amp;nbsp;– they were not able to solve them manually either.&lt;ref name="Project Stiltwalker"/&gt; The web accessibility organization WebAIM reported in May 2012, "Over 90% of respondents [screen reader users] find CAPTCHA to be very or somewhat difficult."&lt;ref name="webAIM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey4/#captcha/|title=Screen Reader User Survey #4 Results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

reCAPTCHA frequently modifies its system, requiring spammers to frequently update their methods of decoding, which may frustrate potential abusers.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Only words that both OCR programs failed to recognize are used as control words. Thus, any program that can recognize these words with nonnegligible probability would represent an improvement over state of the art OCR programs.&lt;ref name="Ahn, Ben Maurer 2008" /&gt;

== Derivative projects ==
reCAPTCHA had also created project Mailhide, which protects [[email address]]es on web pages from being [[e-mail address harvesting|harvested]] by [[e-mail spam|spammers]].&lt;ref name="Mailhide" /&gt;  By default, the email address is converted into a format that does not allow a [[web crawler|crawler]] to see the full email address; for example, "mailme@example.com" would be converted to "mai...@example.com". The visitor would then click on the "..." and solve the CAPTCHA in order to obtain the full email address. One can also edit the pop-up code so that none of the address is visible.

      <comment>/* Definition */ including FDA 2010 objectives for Regulatory Science</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11982">'''Regulatory science''' is the scientific and technical foundations upon which regulations are based in various industries – particularly those involving health or safety.  Regulatory bodies employing such principles in the US include for example the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] for food and medical products, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] for the environment, and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] for work safety.

"Regulatory science" is contrasted with [[regulatory affairs]] and [[regulatory law]], which refer to the administrative or legal aspects of regulation, in that the former is focused on the regulations' ''scientific'' underpinnings and concerns – rather than the regulations' promulgation, implementation, compliance, or enforcement.{{fact|date=October 2016}}

==History==
Probably the first investigator who recognized the nature of regulatory science was Alvin Weinberg &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinberg|first1=AM|title=Science and trans science|journal=Minerva|date=1970|volume=10|pages=209–222|doi=10.1007/BF01682418}}&lt;/ref&gt; who described the scientific process used to evaluate effects of ionizing radiation as trans science.  The origin of the term '''regulatory science''' is unknown. It was probably coined sometimes in the late 1970s in an undated memorandum prepared by [[A. Alan Moghissi]] who was describing scientific issues that the newly formed US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) was facing. During that period the EPA was forced to meet legally mandated deadlines to make decisions that would require reliance upon science that was not meeting conventional scientific requirements. At that time the prevailing view was that there was no need to establish a new [[scientific discipline]] because “science is science” regardless of how its application. In the spring of 1985 Moghissi established the Institute for Regulatory Science in the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] as a non-profit organization with the objective to perform scientific studies “at the interface between science and the regulatory system”  Moghissi et al.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; have provided an extensive description of history of regulatory science including various perception of regulatory science leading to the acceptance of regulatory science by the FDA

==Definition==
Moghissi ''et al''.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; have described the history of regulatory science and provide two definitions. The first definition is the generalized definition provided by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) “Regulatory science is a scientific discipline consisting of the development and application of scientific methods, tools, approaches, and other relevant processes derived from various scientific disciplines used to support regulatory and other policy objectives”. An abbreviated definition consists of “regulatory science consists of the application of science to support policy notably regulatory objectives”

The objectives, stated by the FDA in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/scienceresearch/specialtopics/regulatoryscience/ucm228444.pdf|title=Advancing Regulatory Science for Public Health|last=|first=FDA|date=2010|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; will provide a basis to: 

* Improve capacity for safety and efficacy evaluations and monitoring of candidate and licensed products,
* Modernize current regulatory pathways,
* Develop new regulatory pathways where there are currently none.

There have been several attempts to define regulatory science. In many cases there are claims that there is a difference between regulatory science and “normal science”, “academic science”, “research science”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jasanoff|first1=S|title=The fifth branch: science advisors as policy makers|date=1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; or compliance with regulations &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gad|first1=SC|title=Regulatory Toxicology|date=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=Philadelphia, PA|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary problem is the lack of appreciation that many branches of science are evolving and much of the evolving science includes inherent uncertainties.

==Application of regulatory science==
Regulatory science is included in every regulation that includes science. The regulatory science community&lt;ref name="j1"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Straja|first2=Sorin R.|last3=Love|first3=Betty R.|last4=McBride|first4=Dennis K.|last5=Stough|first5=Roger R.|date=2014|title=Innovation in Regulatory Science: Evolution of a new scientific discipline|journal=Technology and Innovation|volume=16|issue=2|pages=155–165|doi=10.3727/194982414X14096821477027|last1=Moghissi|first1=AA}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of three groups of regulatory scientists: 
*Those who are involved in development of regulations. Typically this group is employed by regulatory agencies 
*Those who must comply with regulations. Typically this group consists of employees or contractors of regulated community.
*Those segments of the scientific community who perform research and development in areas relevant to the relevant regulated community.

The third group is of particular significance as they consist of organizations and individuals who support the first two groups. Included in this group are members of numerous advisory panels, organizations that provide peer reviews, and members of peer review panels. An example of this group is the National Academies consisting of the National Academy of Science, National Academy of Engineering, Institute of Medicine, and National Research Council.   
The application of regulatory science occurs in three phases. During the first phase the regulators must meet a legislative or court- mandated deadline and promulgate regulations using their best judgment. The second phase provides opportunity to develop regulatory science tools. These include human health and ecological risk assessment procedures and post marketing evaluation method d processes for drugs ad medical devices. The third Standard Operating phase, used tools developed during the second phase to improve the initial decision. ( Moghissi et al.)

==Regulatory engineering==
[[Engineering]] is the development of new products and processes, hence regulatory engineering encompasses principally the development of products and processes to facilitate or better examine regulations or their scientific foundations.  Another related segment of regulatory science deal with the application of engineering design or analysis to operations such as the safety of nuclear and other power plants, chemical production facilities, mining operations, and air transportation.

Sometimes the term "regulatory engineer(ing)" is misused to refer to essentially administrative or regulatory roles dealing with organizing or coordinating regulatory matters for an organization; however, "engineering" refers only to functional design of products and processes, and in many jurisdictions this definition is legally enforced (see [[Regulation and licensure in engineering]]).

==Areas of focus==

===Regulatory pharmaceutical medicine===
Consistent with its mission, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggests that “Regulatory science is the science of developing new tools, standards and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality and performance of FDA-regulated products.”
Based on several decades of experience regulatory science is logically defined as a distinct scientific discipline constituting the scientific foundation of regulatory, legislative, and judicial decisions. Much like many scientific disciplines that have evolved within the last several decades, regulatory science is both [[interdisciplinary]] and [[multidisciplinary]] and relies upon a large number of basic and applied scientific disciplines.

Regulatory science is an emerging area of interest within pharmaceutical medicine as the shaping and implementation of legislation and guidelines. One definition of “regulatory science” is the science of developing new tools, standards and approaches to evaluate the efficacy, safety, quality and performance of medical products in order to assess benefit-risk and facilitate a sound and transparent regulatory decision-making. It has been recognized as having a significant impact on the industry’s ability to bring new medicines and medical devices to patients in need. Regulatory science challenges current concepts of benefit/risk assessment, submission and approval strategies, patient’s involvement and ethical aspects. It creates the platform for launching new ideas – not only by the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authorities, but also by, for example, academia, who wants to contribute to better use of their research activities within medical aspects. Regulatory science &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=FDA (Food and Drug Administration)|title=The Promise of regulatory science|url=http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RegulatoryScience/ucm228206.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; has the potential as an enabler for directing companies towards more efficient global development of medical products as well as more robust quality decision-making processes.

===Human health===
By far the predominant foci of Regulatory Science pertain to human health and well-being. This realm covers a broad range of scientific areas – including pollution and [[toxicology]], work safety, food, drugs, and numerous others.

===Ecology===
Regulatory [[ecology]] covers resources the [[Protected species|protection of various species]], [[Wetland conservation|protection of wetlands]], and numerous other regulated areas including [[ecotoxicology]].

For example, the US Clean Water Act is based upon an interest in protecting water quality for its own sake, in contrast with the Clean Air Act which is premised upon protecting air quality only for the sake of human health; however, these are ideological policy premises rather than scientific matters themselves.

The US Department of Agriculture regulates animal care, and the FDA regulates humaneness for animal studies.

The US Department of Interior, [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS), and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]], [[National Marine Fisheries Service]], implement the development and enforcement of policies required by the [[Endangered Species Act|Federal Endangered Species Act]] (FESA), [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty Act]], and other biological resources laws. The FESA requires that the decisions to list a species as endangered or threatened are based on the best available scientific data. To that end, the USFWS, and other government agencies fund research to determine the conservation status of proposed species. Regulatory scientists within the Services review, evaluate, and incorporate data from these studies of proposed species in their published regulations. Survey protocols for listed species are also developed from scientific studies of their target species. The purpose of the protocols is to reliably and accurately determine the residency of the target species in a given study area.

==Regulatory economics==
There are numerous [[Regulatory economics|economic decisions]] in the regulatory process including the [[economics]] part of [[cost-benefit analysis]].

==Science in legislation and in courts==
Although often less than fully recognized the scientific foundation of [[Legislation|legislative]] decisions are included in regulatory science and should be based on reliable science. Similarly [[Court of law|courts]] have recognized the need to rely upon information that meets scientific requirements.

{{For|the art medium|social practice (art)}}

'''Social artistry''' is the attempt to address or recognize a particular social issue using art and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pyeglobal.org/social-artists/ Social Artists]&lt;/ref&gt; Social artists are people who use creative skills to work with people or organizations in their community to affect change.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Houston [http://www.jeanhouston.org/Social-Artistry/social-artistry.html Social Artistry]&lt;/ref&gt; While a traditional artist uses their creative skills to express their take on the world, a social artist puts their skills to use to help promote and improve communities. Thus, the main aim of a social artist is to improve society as a whole and to help other people find their own means of creative expression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialartistryinstitute.org/who_we_are.htm Institute of Social Artistry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social artists may address issues such as youth alienation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pyeglobal.org/creative-youth-camps/ Creative Youth Camps]&lt;/ref&gt; or the breakdown of communities.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Houston [http://education.jhu.edu/research/newhorizons/future/articles/social-artistry/index.html Social Artistry]&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly, social artists will address these problems by helping people express themselves and find their voice, or by bringing people together and using art to help them to foster an understanding of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Wenger-Trayner [http://wenger-trayner.com/resources/social-artists/ Social Artists]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social artistry can incorporate several different art forms including [[theatre]], [[poetry]], [[music]] and [[Visual arts|visual art]]. 

Findings from 2013 confirm the shift from individual expression to community engagement, or "from autonomous to socially engaged."&lt;ref&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work,' in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt; Lingo and Tepper cite several examples:
#contemporary artists "see themselves as educators, social workers, policy actors, and health providers (Lena &amp; Cornfield, 2008; Simonds, 2013; Throsby &amp; Zednik, 2011)
#Nick Rabkin writes "more arts graduates end up in education than in any other occupation" (2013)
#social practice artists "freely blur the lines among object making, performance, political activism, community organizing, environmentalism and investigative journalism, creating a deeply [[participatory art]] that often flourishes outside the gallery and museum system"&lt;ref&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work,' in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24397">'''Source–sink dynamics''' is a theoretical model used by ecologists to describe how variation in [[habitat]] quality may affect the [[population dynamics|population]] growth or decline of [[organism]]s.

Since quality is likely to vary among patches of habitat, it is important to consider how a low quality patch might affect a population.  In this model, organisms occupy two patches of habitat.  One patch, the source, is a high quality habitat that on average allows the population to increase. The second patch, the sink, is very low quality habitat that, on its own, would not be able to support a population.  However, if the excess of [[individual]]s produced in the source frequently moves to the sink, the sink population can persist indefinitely.  Organisms are generally assumed to be able to distinguish between high and low quality habitat, and to prefer high quality habitat.  However, [[ecological traps|ecological trap]] theory describes the reasons why organisms may actually prefer sink patches over source [[Landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patches]].  Finally, the source-sink model implies that some habitat patches may be more important to the long-term survival of the population, and considering the presence of source-sink dynamics will help inform [[conservation ethic|conservation]] decisions.

==Theory development==
Although the seeds of a source-sink model had been planted earlier,&lt;ref&gt;Holt, R. D. 1985. Population-Dynamics in 2-Patch Environments - Some Anomalous Consequences of an Optimal Habitat Distribution. [[Theoretical Population Biology]] 28:181-208.&lt;/ref&gt; Pulliam&lt;ref name="Pulliam-1988"&gt;Pulliam, H. R. 1988. Sources, sinks, and population regulation. [[American Naturalist]] 132:652-661.&lt;/ref&gt; is often recognized as the first to present a fully developed source-sink model.  He defined source and sink patches in terms of their demographic parameters, or [[Matrix population models|BIDE rates]] ([[birth]], [[immigration]], [[death]], and [[emigration]] rates).  In the source patch, birth rates were greater than death rates, causing the population to grow.  The excess individuals were expected to leave the patch, so that emigration rates were greater than immigration rates.  In other words, sources were a net exporter of individuals.  In contrast, in a sink patch, death rates were greater than birth rates, resulting in a population decline toward extinction unless enough individuals emigrated from the source patch.  Immigration rates were expected to be greater than emigration rates, so that sinks were a net importer of individuals.  As a result, there would be a net flow of individuals from the source to the sink [[#table1|(see Table 1)]].

Pulliam's work was followed by many others who developed and tested the source-sink model.  Watkinson and Sutherland&lt;ref name="Watkinson-1995"&gt;Watkinson, A. R., and W. J. Sutherland. 1995. Sources, sinks and pseudo-sinks. [[Journal of Animal Ecology]] 64:126-130.&lt;/ref&gt; presented a phenomenon in which high immigration rates could cause a patch to appear to be a sink by raising the patch's population above its [[carrying capacity]] (the number of individuals it can support).  However, in the absence of immigration, the patches are able to support a smaller population.  Since true sinks cannot support any population, the authors called these patches "pseudo-sinks". Definitively distinguishing between true sinks and pseudo-sinks requires cutting off immigration to the patch in question and determining whether the patch is still able to maintain a population.  Thomas et al.&lt;ref name="Thomas-1996"&gt;Thomas, C. D., M. C. Singer, and D. A. Boughton. 1996. Catastrophic extinction of population sources in a butterfly metapopulation. [[American Naturalist]] 148:957-975.&lt;/ref&gt; were able to do just that, taking advantage of an unseasonable frost that killed off the host plants for a source population of [[list of subspecies of Euphydryas editha|Edith's checkerspot butterfly]] (''Euphydryas editha''). Without the host plants, the supply of immigrants to other nearby patches was cut off.  Although these patches had appeared to be sinks, they did not become extinct without the constant supply of immigrants.  They were capable of sustaining a smaller population, suggesting that they were in fact pseudo-sinks.

Watkinson and Sutherland's&lt;ref name="Watkinson-1995"/&gt; caution about identifying pseudo-sinks was followed by Dias,&lt;ref name="Dias-1996"&gt;Dias, P. C. 1996. Sources and sinks in population biology. [[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] 11:326-330.&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that differentiating between sources and sinks themselves may be difficult.  She asserted that a long-term study of the demographic parameters of the populations in each patch is necessary.  Otherwise, temporary variations in those parameters, perhaps due to climate fluctuations or natural disasters, may result in a misclassification of the patches.  For example, Johnson&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. M. 2004. Source-sink dynamics in a temporally, heterogeneous environment. [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] 85:2037-2045.&lt;/ref&gt; described periodic flooding of a river in [[Costa Rica]] which completely inundated patches of the host plant for a rolled-leaf beetle (''Cephaloleia fenestrata'').  During the floods, these patches became sinks, but at other times they were no different from other patches.  If researchers had not considered what happened during the floods, they would not have understood the full complexity of the system.

Dias&lt;ref name="Dias-1996"/&gt; also argued that an inversion between source and sink habitat is possible so that the sinks may actually become the sources.  Because reproduction in source patches is much higher than in sink patches, natural selection is generally expected to favor adaptations to the source habitat.  However, if the proportion of source to sink habitat changes so that sink habitat becomes much more available, organisms may begin to adapt to it instead.  Once adapted, the sink may become a source habitat.  This is believed to have occurred for the [[blue tit]] (''Parus caeruleus'') 7500 years ago as forest composition on [[Corsica]] changed, but few modern examples are known.  Boughton&lt;ref name="Boughton-1999"&gt;Boughton, D. A. 1999. Empirical Evidence for Complex Source-Sink Dynamics with Alternative States in a Butterfly Metapopulation. [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] 80:2727-2739.&lt;/ref&gt; described a source—pseudo-sink inversion in butterfly populations of ''E. editha''.&lt;ref name="Thomas-1996"/&gt;  Following the frost, the butterflies had difficulty recolonizing the former source patches.  Boughton found that the host plants in the former sources senesced much earlier than in the former pseudo-sink patches.  As a result, immigrants regularly arrived too late to successfully reproduce.  He found that the former pseudo-sinks had become sources, and the former sources had become true sinks.

One of the most recent additions to the source-sink literature is by Tittler et al.,&lt;ref name="Tittler-2006"&gt;Tittler, R., L. Fahrig, and M. A. Villard. 2006. Evidence of large-scale source-sink dynamics and long-distance dispersal among wood thrush populations. [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] 87:3029-3036.&lt;/ref&gt; who examined [[wood thrush]] (''Hylocichla mustelina'') survey data for evidence of source and sink populations on a large scale.  The authors reasoned that emigrants from sources would likely be the juveniles produced in one year dispersing to reproduce in sinks in the next year, producing a one-year time lag between population changes in the source and in the sink.  Using data from the [[Breeding Bird Survey]], an annual survey of North American birds, they looked for relationships between survey sites showing such a one-year time lag.  They found several pairs of sites showing significant relationships 60–80&amp;nbsp;km apart.  Several appeared to be sources to more than one sink, and several sinks appeared to receive individuals from more than one source.  In addition, some sites appeared to be a sink to one site and a source to another (see Figure 1).  The authors concluded that source-sink dynamics may occur on continental scales.

One of the more confusing issues involves identifying sources and sinks in the field.&lt;ref name="Runge-2006"&gt;Runge, J. P., M. C. Runge and J. D. Nichols. 2006. The role of local populations within a landscape context:defining and classifying sources and sinks. [[American Naturalist]] 167:925-938.&lt;/ref&gt;  Runge et al.&lt;ref name="Runge-2006"/&gt; point out that in general researchers need to estimate per capita reproduction, probability of survival, and probability of emigration to differentiate source and sink habitats.  If emigration is ignored, then individuals that emigrate may be treated as mortalities, thus causing sources to be classified as sinks.  This issue is important if the source-sink concept is viewed in terms of habitat quality (as it is in Table 1) because classifying high-quality habitat as low-quality may lead to mistakes in ecological management.  Runge et al.&lt;ref name="Runge-2006"/&gt; showed how to integrate the theory of source-sink dynamics with population projection matrices&lt;ref name="Caswell-2001"&gt;Caswell, H. 2001.

K., J. D. Nichols, and M. J. Conroy. 2001. Analysis and management of animal populations.  Academic Press. San Diego, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to differentiate sources and sinks.

|''Habitat patches are represented in terms of their (1) inherent abilities to maintain a population (in the absence of immigration), (2) their attractiveness to organisms that are actively dispersing and choosing habitat patches, and (3) whether they are net exporters or importers of dispersing individuals.  Note that in all of these systems, source patches are capable of supporting stable or growing populations and are net exporters of individuals.  The major difference between them is that in the ecological trap model, the source patch is avoided (or at least not preferred to the low quality trap patch).  All of the low quality patches (whether sinks, pseudo-sinks, or traps) are net importers of dispersing individuals, and in the absence of dispersal, would show a population decline.  However, pseudo-sinks would not decline to extinction as they are capable of supporting a smaller population.  The other major difference between these low quality patch types is in their attractiveness; sink populations are avoided while trap patches are preferred (or at least not avoided).''

==Modes of dispersal==
Why would individuals ever leave high quality source habitat for a low quality sink habitat? This question is central to source-sink theory.  Ultimately, it depends on the organisms and the way they move and distribute themselves between habitat patches. For example, plants disperse passively, relying on other agents such as wind or water currents to move seeds to another patch. Passive dispersal can result in source-sink dynamics whenever the seeds land in a patch that cannot support the plant's growth or reproduction. Winds may continually deposit seeds there, maintaining a population even though the plants themselves do not successfully reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P. A. 1982. Population Ecology on an Environmental Gradient - Cakile-Edentula on a Sand Dune. [[Oecologia]] 52:348-355.&lt;/ref&gt; Another good example for this case are soil protists. Soil protists also disperse passively, relying mainly on wind to colonize other sites.&lt;ref&gt;Foissner, W. 1987. Soil protozoa: fundamental problems, ecological significance, adaptations in ciliates and testaceans, bioindicators, and guide to the literature. [[Progress in Protistology]] 2:69-212.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, source-sink dynamics can arise simply because external agents dispersed protist propagules (e.g., cysts, spores), forcing individuals to grow in a poor habitat.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández, L. D. 2015. Source-sink dynamics shapes the spatial distribution of soil protists in an arid shrubland of northern Chile. [[Journal of Arid Environments]] 113:121-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, many organisms that disperse actively should have no reason to remain in a sink patch,&lt;ref name="Diffendorfer-1998"&gt;Diffendorfer, J. E. 1998. Testing models of source-sink dynamics and balanced dispersal. [[Oikos (journal)|Oikos]] 81:417-433.&lt;/ref&gt; provided the organisms are able to recognize it as a poor quality patch (see discussion of [[ecological traps]]).  The reasoning behind this argument is that organisms are often expected to behave according to the "[[ideal free distribution]]", which describes a population in which individuals distribute themselves evenly among habitat patches according to how many individuals the patch can support.&lt;ref&gt;Fretwell, S. D., and H. L. Lucas, Jr. 1969. On territorial behavior and other factors influencing habitat distribution in birds. [[Acta Biotheoretica]] 19:16-36.&lt;/ref&gt;  When there are patches of varying quality available, the ideal free distribution predicts a pattern of "balanced dispersal".&lt;ref name="Diffendorfer-1998"/&gt;  In this model, when the preferred habitat patch becomes crowded enough that the average [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] (survival rate or reproductive success) of the individuals in the patch drops below the average fitness in a second, lower quality patch, individuals are expected to move to the second patch.  However, as soon as the second patch becomes sufficiently crowded, individuals are expected to move back to the first patch.  Eventually, the patches should become balanced so that the average fitness of the individuals in each patch and the rates of dispersal between the two patches are even.  In this balanced dispersal model, the probability of leaving a patch is inversely proportional to the carrying capacity of the patch.&lt;ref name="Diffendorfer-1998"/&gt;  In this case, individuals should not remain in sink habitat for very long, where the carrying capacity is zero and the probability of leaving is therefore very high.

An alternative to the ideal free distribution and balanced dispersal models is when fitness can vary among potential breeding sites within habitat patches and individuals must select the best available site.  This alternative has been called the "ideal preemptive distribution", because a breeding site can be preempted if it has already been occupied.&lt;ref&gt;Pulliam, H. R., and B. J. Danielson. 1991. Sources, Sinks, and Habitat Selection - a Landscape Perspective on Population-Dynamics. [[American Naturalist]] 137:S50-S66.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the dominant, older individuals in a population may occupy all of the best territories in the source so that the next best territory available may be in the sink.  As the subordinate, younger individuals age, they may be able to take over territories in the source, but new subordinate juveniles from the source will have to move to the sink.  Pulliam&lt;ref name="Pulliam-1988"/&gt; argued that such a pattern of dispersal can maintain a large sink population indefinitely.  Furthermore, if good breeding sites in the source are rare and poor breeding sites in the sink are common, it is even possible that the majority of the population resides in the sink.

==Importance in ecology==
The source-sink model of population dynamics has made contributions to many areas in ecology.  For example, a species' [[ecological niche|niche]] was originally described as the environmental factors required by a species to carry out its life history, and a species was expected to be found only in areas that met these niche requirements.&lt;ref name="Grinnell-1917"&gt;Grinnell, J. 1917. The Niche-Relationships of the California Thrasher. [[The Auk]] 34:427-433.&lt;/ref&gt;  This concept of a niche was later termed the "fundamental niche", and described as all of the places a species could successfully occupy.  In contrast, the "realized niche", was described as all of the places a species actually did occupy, and was expected to be less than the extent of the fundamental niche as a result of competition with other species.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, G. E. 1957. Concluding remarks. Cold Spring Harbor Symposium [[Quantitative Biology]] 22:415-427.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the source-sink model demonstrated that the majority of a population could occupy a sink which, by definition, did not meet the niche requirements of the species,&lt;ref name="Pulliam-1988"/&gt; and was therefore outside the fundamental niche (see Figure 2).  In this case, the realized niche was actually larger than the fundamental niche, and ideas about how to define a species' niche had to change.

Source–sink dynamics has also been incorporated into studies of [[metapopulation]]s, a group of populations residing in patches of habitat.  Though some patches may go extinct, the regional persistence of the metapopulation depends on the ability of patches to be re-colonized.  As long as there are source patches present for successful reproduction, sink patches may allow the total number of individuals in the metapopulation to grow beyond what the source could support, providing a reserve of individuals available for re-colonization.&lt;ref name="Howe-1991"&gt;Howe, R. W., G. J. Davis, and V. Mosca. 1991. The Demographic Significance of Sink Populations. [[Biological Conservation]] 57:239-255.&lt;/ref&gt; Source–sink dynamics also has implications for studies of the coexistence of species within habitat patches.  Because a patch that is a source for one species may be a sink for another, coexistence may actually depend on immigration from a second patch rather than the interactions between the two species.&lt;ref name="Pulliam-1988"/&gt;  Similarly, source-sink dynamics may influence the regional coexistence and demographics of species within a [[metacommunity]], a group of communities connected by the dispersal of potentially interacting species.&lt;ref&gt;Leibold, M. A., M. Holyoak, J. M. Chase, M. F. Hoopes, R. D. Holt, J. B. Shurin, R. Law, D. Tilman, M. Loreau, and A. Gonzalez. 2004. The metacommunity concept: a framework for multi-scale community ecology. [[Ecology Letters]] 7:601-613.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, the source-sink model has greatly influenced [[ecological traps|ecological trap theory]], a model in which organisms prefer sink habitat over source habitat.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, B. A., and R. L. Hutto. 2006. A framework for understanding ecological traps and an evaluation of existing evidence. [[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] 87:1075-1085.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
Land managers and conservationists have become increasingly interested in preserving and restoring high quality habitat, particularly where rare, threatened, or endangered species are concerned.  As a result, it is important to understand how to identify or create high quality habitat, and how populations respond to habitat loss or change.  Because a large proportion of a species' population could exist in sink habitat,&lt;ref name=lamb16&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lamb |first=C.T.. |authorlink= |author2=Mowat, G. |author3=McLellan, B.N. |author4=Nielsen, S.E. |author5=Boutin, S. |year=2016 |title=Forbidden fruit: human settlement and abundant fruit create an ecological trap for an apex omnivore |journal=[[Journal of Animal Ecology]]  |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=55–65 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12589|pmid= |issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; conservation efforts may misinterpret the species' habitat requirements.  Similarly, without considering the presence of a trap, conservationists might mistakenly preserve trap habitat under the assumption that an organism's preferred habitat was also good quality habitat.  Simultaneously, source habitat may be ignored or even destroyed if only a small proportion of the population resides there.  Degradation or destruction of the source habitat will, in turn, impact the sink or trap populations, potentially over large distances.&lt;ref name="Tittler-2006"/&gt;  Finally, efforts to restore degraded habitat may unintentionally create an ecological trap by giving a site the appearance of quality habitat, but which has not yet developed all of the functional elements necessary for an organism's survival and reproduction.  For an already threatened species, such mistakes might result in a rapid population decline toward extinction.

In considering where to place [[nature reserves|reserves]], protecting source habitat is often assumed to be the goal, although if the cause of a sink is human activity, simply designating an area as a reserve has the potential to convert current sink patches to source patches (e.g. [[no-take zones]]).&lt;ref name="Roberts-1998"&gt;Roberts, C. M. 1998. Sources, sinks, and the design of marine reserve networks. [[Fisheries (journal)|Fisheries]] 23:16-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Either way, determining which areas are sources or sinks for any one species may be very difficult,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Derek E.|last2=Bolger|first2=Douglas T.|date=2017-05-05|title=Movements and source–sink dynamics of a Masai giraffe metapopulation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10144-017-0580-7|journal=Population Ecology|language=en|pages=1–12|doi=10.1007/s10144-017-0580-7|issn=1438-3896}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an area that is a source for one species may be unimportant to others.  Finally, areas that are sources or sinks currently may not be in the future as habitats are continually altered by human activity or climate change.  Few areas can be expected to be universal sources, or universal sinks.&lt;ref name="Roberts-1998"/&gt;  While the presence of source, sink, or trap patches must be considered for short-term population survival, especially for very small populations, long-term survival may depend on the creation of networks of reserves that incorporate a variety of habitats and allow populations to interact.&lt;ref name="Roberts-1998"/&gt;

In [[anatomy]], a '''spatium''' or '''anatomic space''' is a space (cavity or gap). Anatomic spaces are often landmarks to find other important structures. When they fill with gases (such as air) or liquids (such as blood) in pathological ways, they can suffer conditions such as [[pneumothorax]], [[edema]], or [[pericardial effusion]]. Many anatomic spaces are [[potential space]]s, which means that they are potential rather than realized (with their realization being dynamic according to [[physiology|physiologic]] or [[pathophysiology|pathophysiologic]] events). In other words, they are like an empty plastic bag that has not been opened (two walls collapsed against each other; no interior [[volume]] until opened) or a balloon that has not been inflated.

In [[botany]], a '''stipe ''' is a stalk that supports some other structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/glossary_8.html|title=UCMP Glossary: Botany|publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology|accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise meaning is different depending on which taxonomic group is being described.

[[Image:Cyathea medullaris.jpg|thumb|180px|Hexagonal stipe bases of the fern ''[[Cyathea medullaris]]'']]
[[Image:Phalaenopsis orchid-Stipe.jpg|thumb|An orchid's stipe, with pollinia]]
[[Image:Laminaria hyperborea.jpg|thumb|The stipe of a brown alga]]
In the case of [[fern]]s, the stipe is only the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] from the [[rootstock]] to the beginning of the [[leaf]] tissue, or lamina. The continuation of the structure within the lamina is then termed a [[rachis]].

In flowering plants, the term is often used in reference to a stalk that sometimes supports a flower's [[ovary (plants)|ovary]]. In [[orchid]]s, the stipe or caudicle is the stalk-like support of the [[pollinium|pollinia]]. It is a non-viscid band or strap connecting the pollinia with the viscidium (the viscid part of the [[rostellum]] or beak).

A stipe is also a structure found in organisms that are studied by botanists but that are no longer classified as plants. It may be the stem-like part of the [[thallus (tissue)|thallus]] of a [[mushroom]] or a [[seaweed]], and is particularly common among [[brown algae]] such as kelp. The stipe of a kelp often contains a central region of cells that, like the [[phloem]] of vascular plants, serves to transport nutrients within the alga.

== Recombinant DNA Technology ==
Soon after the discovery of [[Restriction enzyme|restriction endonucleases]] and [[ligase]]s, the field of genetics began using these molecular tools to assemble artificial sequences from smaller fragments of synthetic or naturally occurring [[DNA]]. The advantage in using the recombinatory approach as opposed to continual [[DNA synthesis]] stems from the inverse relationship that exists between synthetic DNA length and percent purity of that synthetic length. In other words, as you synthesize longer sequences, the number of error-containing clones increases due to the inherent error rates of current technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Synthetic genomics: potential and limitations|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0958166912000298|journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology|pages = 659–665|volume = 23|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.copbio.2012.01.014|first = Michael G|last = Montague|first2 = Carole|last2 = Lartigue|first3 = Sanjay|last3 = Vashee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[recombinant DNA]] technology is more commonly used in the construction of [[fusion proteins]] and [[plasmid]]s, several techniques with larger capacities have emerged, allowing for the construction of entire genomes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Synthetic Biology, Part B: Computer Aided Design and DNA Assembly; Chapter Fifteen - Enzymatic Assembly of Overlapping DNA Fragments|last = Gibson|first = Daniel|publisher = Academic Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-12-385120-8|pages = 349–361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polymerase Cycling Assembly ===
[[File:PCA illustrated by Nivin Nasri (edited).png|thumb|Polymerase Cycling Assembly. Blue arrows represent oligonucleotides 40 to 60 bp with overlapping regions of about 20 bp. The cycle is repeated until the final genome is constructed.]]
[[Polymerase cycling assembly]] (PCA) uses a series of oligonucleotides (or oligos), approximately 40 to 60 nucleotides long, that altogether constitute both strands of the DNA being synthesized. These oligos are designed such that a single oligo from one strand contains a length of approximately 20 nucleotides at each end that is complementary to sequences of two different oligos on the opposite strand, thereby creating regions of overlap. The entire set is processed through cycles of: (a) [[Hybridization (biology)|hybridization]] at 60&amp;nbsp;°C; (b) elongation via [[Taq polymerase]] and a standard ligase; and (c) denaturation at 95&amp;nbsp;°C, forming progressively longer contiguous strands and ultimately resulting in the final genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Single-step assembly of a gene and entire plasmid from large numbers of oligodeoxyribonucleotides|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378111995005114|journal = Gene|date = 1995-10-16|pages = 49–53|volume = 164|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/0378-1119(95)00511-4|first = Willem P.

=== Gibson Assembly Method ===
[[File:GAM illustrated by Nivin Nasri.png|thumb|Gibson Assembly Method. The blue arrows represent DNA cassettes, which could be any size, 6 kb each for example. The orange segments represent areas of identical DNA sequences. This process can be carried out with multiple initial cassettes.]]
The [[Gibson assembly|Gibson Assembly Method]], designed by Daniel Gibson during his time at the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]], requires a set of double-stranded DNA cassettes that constitute the entire genome being synthesized. Note that cassettes differ from contigs by definition, in that these sequences contain regions of homology to other cassettes for the purposes of [[Homologous recombination|recombination]]. In contrast to Polymerase Cycling Assembly, Gibson Assembly is a single-step, isothermal reaction with larger sequence-length capacity; ergo, it is used in place of Polymerase Cycling Assembly for genomes larger than 6 kb.

A T5 [[exonuclease]] performs a chew-back reaction at the terminal segments, working in the 5' to 3' direction, thereby producing complimentary overhangs. The overhangs hybridize to each other, a Phusion [[DNA polymerase]] fills in any missing nucleotides and the nicks are sealed with a ligase. However, the genomes capable of being synthesized using this method alone is limited because as DNA cassettes increase in length, they require propagation in vitro in order to continue hybridizing; accordingly, Gibson assembly is often used in conjunction with Transformation-Associated Recombination (see below) to synthesize genomes several hundred kilobases in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Enzymatic assembly of DNA molecules up to several hundred kilobases|url = http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nmeth.1318|journal = Nature Methods|pages = 343–345|volume = 6|issue = 5|doi = 10.1038/nmeth.1318|first = Daniel G|last = Gibson|first2 = Lei|last2 = Young|first3 = Ray-Yuan|last3 = Chuang|first4 = J Craig|last4 = Venter|first5 = Clyde A|last5 = Hutchison|first6 = Hamilton O|last6 = Smith|date = 2009-04-12|pmid=19363495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transformation-Associated Recombination ===
[[File:GRC illustrated by Nivin Nasri.png|thumb|Gap Repair Cloning. The blue arrows represent DNA contigs. Segments of the same colour represent complimentary or identical sequences. Specialized primers with extensions are used in a polymerase chain reaction to generate regions of homology at the terminal ends of the DNA contigs.]]
The goal of Transformation-Associated Recombination (TAR) technology in synthetic genomics is to combine DNA contigs by means of [[homologous recombination]] performed by the [[Yeast artificial chromosome|Yeast Artificial Chromosome]] (YAC). Of importance is the CEN element within the YAC [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]], which corresponds to the yeast centromere. This sequence gives the vector the ability to behave in a chromosomal manner, thereby allowing it to perform [[Homologous recombination|homologous recombination.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Exploiting the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the study of the organization and evolution of complex genomes|url = http://femsre.oxfordjournals.org/content/27/5/629|journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews|date = 2003-12-01|issn = 1574-6976|pmid = 14638416|pages = 629–649|volume = 27|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/S0168-6445(03)00070-6|first = Natalay|last = Kouprina|first2 = Vladimir|last2 = Larionov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:TAR illustrated by Nivin Nasri (edited).png|thumb|Transformation-Associated Recombination. Cross over events occur between regions of homology across the cassettes and YAC vector, thereby connecting the smaller DNA sequences into one larger contig.]]
First, Gap Repair Cloning is performed to generate regions of homology flanking the DNA contigs. Gap Repair Cloning is a particular form of the [[polymerase chain reaction|Polymerase Chain Reaction]] in which specialized [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]] with extensions beyond the sequence of the DNA target are utilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Many Paths to Many Clones: A Comparative Look at High-Throughput Cloning Methods|url = http://genome.cshlp.org/content/14/10b/2020|journal = Genome Research|date = 2004-10-15|issn = 1088-9051|pmid = 15489321|pages = 2020–2028|volume = 14|issue = 10b|doi = 10.1101/gr.2528804|first = Gerald|last = Marsischky|first2 = Joshua|last2 = LaBaer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the DNA cassettes are exposed to the YAC vector, which drives the process of homologous recombination, thereby connecting the DNA cassettes. Polymerase Cycling Assembly and TAR technology were used together to construct the 600 kb ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' genome in 2008, the first synthetic organism ever created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Complete Chemical Synthesis, Assembly, and Cloning of a Mycoplasma genitalium Genome|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5867/1215|journal = Science|date = 2008-02-29|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 18218864|pages = 1215–1220|volume = 319|issue = 5867|doi = 10.1126/science.1151721|first = Daniel G.|last = Gibson|first2 = Gwynedd A.|last2 = Benders|first3 = Cynthia|last3 = Andrews-Pfannkoch|first4 = Evgeniya A.|last4 = Denisova|first5 = Holly|last5 = Baden-Tillson|first6 = Jayshree|last6 = Zaveri|first7 = Timothy B.|last7 = Stockwell|first8 = Anushka|last8 = Brownley|first9 = David W.|last9 = Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar steps were taken in synthesizing the larger ''[[Mycoplasma mycoides]]'' genome a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Creation of a Bacterial Cell Controlled by a Chemically Synthesized Genome|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/329/5987/52|journal = Science|date = 2010-07-02|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 20488990|pages = 52–56|volume = 329|issue = 5987|doi = 10.1126/science.1190719|first = Daniel G.|last = Gibson|first2 = John I.|last2 = Glass|first3 = Carole|last3 = Lartigue|first4 = Vladimir N.|last4 = Noskov|first5 = Ray-Yuan|last5 = Chuang|first6 = Mikkel A.|last6 = Algire|first7 = Gwynedd A.|last7 = Benders|first8 = Michael G.|last8 = Montague|first9 = Li|last9 = Ma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9432">The '''Tanabe Hisao Prize''' ({{lang-ja|田辺尚雄音楽賞 or 田辺尚雄賞}}) (often known more simply as the "Tanabe Prize") was created in 1983 by the Tōyō Ongaku Gakkai ({{lang-ja|東洋音楽学会}}, "Society for Research in Asiatic Music"), the oldest musicological society of [[Japan]] (headquartered in [[Tokyo]]).  The prize is named after the musicologist [[Tanabe Hisao]] ({{lang-ja|田辺尚雄}},1883–1984), one of the founding members of the society.  The prize is awarded annually to one or several individuals or groups who have published an outstanding work of Asian [[musicology]]  during the previous year, one that "promotes further research in Asian musicology and contributes to Japanese scholarship."  It is generally considered the most prestigious award in the field of Asian musicology awarded in Japan.

The '''Test of Economic Knowledge''' or '''TEK''' is a [[standardized test]] of [[economics]] nationally [[norm-referenced test|norm-referenced]] in the United States for use in middle schools and in lower-grade levels of high schools.  It is one of four grade-level specific standardized economics tests (i.e., [[Basic Economics Test]] (BET), [[Test of Economic Literacy]] (TEL) and [[Test of Understanding in College Economics]] (TUCE)) sponsored and published by the [[National Council on Economic Education]] (NCEE) .

The TEK was recently revised into its second edition in 2007 and will soon be available, along with an examiner’s manual, for teachers, school administrators and researchers through the NCEE.  The revision process took place at the [[National Center for Research in Economic Education]] (NCREE) and included a new set of norm-references that consisted of teacher and student participation from twenty-five U.S. states.  The TEK has two parallel forms, each composed of forty 4-option [[multiple-choice]] items with [[content validity]] based on the [[Voluntary National Content Standards in Economics]].

'''''The Case of Wagner''''' ({{lang-de|Der Fall Wagner}}) is a book by the [[philosopher]] [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], originally published in 1888. Subtitled "A Musician's Problem", it has also been known as ''The Wagner Case'' in English. 

==Contents==
The book is a critique of [[Richard Wagner]] and the announcement of Nietzsche's rupture with the German artist, who had involved himself too much, in Nietzsche's eyes, in the [[Völkisch movement|''Völkisch'' movement]] and [[antisemitism]]. His music is no longer represented as a possible "philosophical affect," and Wagner is [[irony|ironically]] compared to [[Georges Bizet]]. However, Nietzsche  presents Wagner as only a particular symptom of a broader "disease" that is affecting Europe: that is, [[nihilism]]. The book shows Nietzsche as a capable music-critic, and provides the setting for some of his further reflections on the nature of art and its relationship to the future health of humanity.

This work is in sharp contrast with the second part of Nietzsche's ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]],'' wherein he praised Wagner as fulfilling a need in music to go beyond the analytic and dispassionate understanding of music. Nietzsche also praised Wagner effusively in his essay "Wagner at Bayreuth" (part of the ''[[Untimely Meditations (Nietzsche)|Untimely Meditations]]''), but his disillusion with Wagner the composer and the man was first seen in his 1878 work ''[[Human, All Too Human]]''.  One of the last works that Nietzsche wrote returned to the critical theme of ''The Case of Wagner''.  In ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]]'', Nietzsche pulled together excerpts from his works to show that he consistently had the same thoughts about music, only that he had misapplied them to Wagner in the earliest works.

'''Thermal hydrolysis''' is a process used for treating [[industrial waste]], [[municipal solid waste]] and [[sewage sludge]].

==Description==
Thermal hydrolysis is a two-stage process combining high-pressure boiling of [[waste]] or [[sludge]] followed by a rapid decompression.

== Commercial application at a sewage treatment plant ==
[[Sewage treatment plant]]s, such as [[Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant|Blue Plains]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], USA, have adopted thermal hydrolysis of sewage sludge in order to produce commercially valuable products (such as electricity and "class A" biosolid fertilizers) out of the [[wastewater]].&lt;ref name="DC Water"&gt;{{cite news |last=Halsey |first=Ashley |date=2014-04-05 |title=DC Water adopts Norway’s Cambi system for making power and fine fertilizer from sewage |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/dc-water-adopts-norways-cambi-system-for-turning-sewage-into-electricity-and-fertilizer/2014/04/05/3d456d7e-a642-11e3-9cff-b1406de784f0_story.html |newspaper=Washington Post |accessdate=2014-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full-scale commercial application of thermal hydrolysis enables the plant to utilize the solids portion of the wastewater to make power and fine fertilizer directly from sewage waste.&lt;ref name="From toilet to turbine"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Berkowitz |first1=Bonnie |last2=Lindeman |first2=Todd |date=2014-04-05 |title=From Toilet to Turbine |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/from-toilet-to-turbine/2014/04/05/9dc0e49e-bd26-11e3-bcec-b71ee10e9bc3_graphic.html |newspaper=Washington Post |accessdate=2014-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Municipal waste-to-fuel application==
The city of [[Oslo]], Norway installed a system for converting domestic food waste to fuel in 2012. A thermal hydrolysis system produces [[biogas]] from the food waste, which provides fuel for the city bus system and is also used for agricultural fertilizer.&lt;ref name="Oslo Biogas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ens-newswire.com/2012/03/23/food-waste-to-fuel-oslos-city-buses/ |title=Food Waste to Fuel Oslo's City Buses |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2012-03-23 |website=Environment News Service |publisher= |location=Lincoln City, OR |accessdate=2014-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11283">In [[logic]], [[finite model theory]], and [[computability theory]], '''Trakhtenbrot's theorem''' (due to [[Boris Trakhtenbrot]]) states that the problem of [[Validity (logic)|validity]] in [[first-order logic]]  on the class of all finite models is [[Recursive set|undecidable]].  In fact, the class of valid sentences over finite models is not [[recursively enumerable]] (though it is [[co-recursively enumerable]]).

Trakhtenbrot's theorem implies that [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] (that is fundamental to first-order logic) does not hold in the finite case.  Also it seems counter-intuitive that being valid over all structures is 'easier' than over just the finite ones.

The theorem was first published in 1950: "The Impossibility of an Algorithm for the Decidability Problem on Finite Classes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Boris|last=Trakhtenbrot | authorlink1=Boris Trakhtenbrot|title=The Impossibility of an Algorithm for the Decidability Problem on Finite Classes|journal=[[Proceedings of the USSR Academy of Sciences]]|language=Russian|volume=70|issue=4|pages= 569–572|year=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical formulation==
We follow the formulations as in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Ebbinghaus | first1=Heinz-Dieter | authorlink1=Heinz-Dieter Ebbinghaus | last2=Flum | first2=Jörg | title=Finite Model Theory | publisher=Springer Science+Business Media | isbn=978-3-540-60149-4 | year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theorem===
:Finite [[satisfiability]] is not decidable in [[first-order logic]].
:That is, the set { φ | φ is a sentence of first-order logic satisfiable in the finite } is undecidable.

===Corollary===
Let σ be a relational vocabulary  with one at least binary relation symbol. 
:The set of [[&amp;sigma;-sentence]]s valid in all finite structures is not [[recursively enumerable]].

'''Remarks'''

# This implies that [[Gödel's completeness theorem]] fails in the finite since completeness implies recursive enumerability.
# It follows that there is no recursive function f such that: if φ has a finite model, then it has a model of size at most f(φ).  In other words, there is no effective analogue to the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] in the finite.

==Intuitive proof==
This proof taken from Chapter 10, section 4, 5 of Mathematical Logic by H.-D. Ebbinghaus.

As in the most common proof of [[Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem]] through using the undecidability of the [[halting problem]], for each [[Turing machine]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; there is a corresponding arithmetical sentence &lt;math&gt;\phi_M&lt;/math&gt;, effectively derivable from &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, such that it is true if and only if &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; halts on the empty tape. Intuitively, &lt;math&gt;\phi_M&lt;/math&gt; asserts "there exists a natural number that is the Gödel code for the computation record of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; on the empty tape that ends with halting".

If the machine &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; does halt in finite steps, then the complete computation record is also finite, then there is a finite initial segment of the natural numbers such that the arithmetical sentence &lt;math&gt;\phi_M&lt;/math&gt; is also true on this initial segment. Intuitively, this is because in this case, proving &lt;math&gt;\phi_M&lt;/math&gt; requires the arithmetic properties of only finitely many numbers.

If the machine &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; does not halt in finite steps, then &lt;math&gt;\phi_M&lt;/math&gt; is false in any finite model, since there's no finite computation record of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; that ends with halting. 

Thus, if &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; halts, &lt;math&gt;\phi_M&lt;/math&gt; is true in some finite models. If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; does not halt, &lt;math&gt;\phi_M&lt;/math&gt; is false in all finite models. So, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; does not halt if and only if &lt;math&gt;\neg\phi_M&lt;/math&gt; is true over all finite models.

The set of machines that does not halt is not recursively enumerable, so the set of valid sentences over finite models is not recursively enumerable.

==Alternative proof==
In this section we exhibit a more rigorous proof from Libkin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Libkin | first1=Leonid | authorlink1=Leonid Libkin | title=Elements of Finite Model Theory | publisher=[[Texts in Theoretical Computer Science]] | isbn=978-3-642-05948-3 | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note in the above statement that the corollary also entails the theorem, and this is the direction we prove here.

'''Theorem'''

:For every relational vocabulary τ with at least one binary relation symbol, it is undecidable whether a sentence φ of vocabulary τ is finitely satisfiable.

'''Proof'''

According to the previous lemma, we can in fact use finitely many binary relation symbols. The idea of the proof is similar to the proof of Fagin's theorem, and we encode Turing machines in first-order logic. What we want to prove is that for every Turing machine M we construct a sentence φ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; of vocabulary τ such that φ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is finitely satisfiable if and only if M halts on the empty input, which is equivalent to the halting problem and therefore undecidable.

Let M= ⟨Q, Σ, δ, q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, Q&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;⟩ be a deterministic Turing machine with a single infinite tape.

* Q is the set of states,
* Σ is the input alphabet,
* Δ is the tape alphabet,
* δ is the transition function,
* q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial state,
* Q&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; and Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; are the sets of accepting and rejecting states.

Since we are dealing with the problem of halting on an empty input we may assume w.l.o.g. that Δ={0,1} and that 0 represents a blank, while 1 represents some tape symbol. We define τ so that we can represent computations:

: τ := {&lt;, &lt;u&gt;min&lt;/u&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (⋅,⋅), T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (⋅,⋅), (H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;(⋅,⋅))&lt;sub&gt;(q ∈ Q)&lt;/sub&gt;}

Where:

* &lt; is a linear order and &lt;u&gt;min&lt;/u&gt; is a constant symbol for the minimal element with respect to &lt; (our finite domain will be associated with an initial segment of the natural numbers).
* T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are tape predicates. T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(s,t) indicates that position s at time t contains i, where i ∈ {0,1}.
* H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'s are head predicates. H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;(s,t) indicates that at time t the machine is in state q, and its head is in position s.

The sentence φ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; states that (i) &lt;, &lt;u&gt;min&lt;/u&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s and H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'s are interpreted as above and (ii) that the machine eventually halts. The halting condition is equivalent to saying that H&lt;sub&gt;q∗&lt;/sub&gt;(s, t) holds for some s, t and q∗ ∈ Q&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; ∪ Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and after that state, the configuration of the machine does not change. Configurations of a halting machine (the nonhalting is not finite) can be represented as a τ (finite) sentence (more precisely, a finite τ-structure which satisfies the sentence). The sentence φ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is: φ ≡ α ∧ β ∧ γ ∧ η ∧ ζ ∧ θ.

We break it down by components:

* α states that &lt; is a linear order and that &lt;u&gt;min&lt;/u&gt; is its minimal element
* γ defines the initial configuration of M: it is in state q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the head is in the first position and the tape contains only zeros: γ ≡ H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;u&gt;min&lt;/u&gt;,&lt;u&gt;min&lt;/u&gt;) ∧ ∀s T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (s, &lt;u&gt;min&lt;/u&gt;)
* η states that in every configuration of M, each tape cell contains exactly one element of Δ: ∀s∀t(T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(s, t) → ¬ T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(s, t))
* β imposes a basic consistency condition on the predicates H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'s: at any time the machine is in exactly one state:

: &lt;math&gt;\forall t \exists ! s (\bigvee_{q\in Q} H_q (s,t))\land \neg\exists s \exists t (\bigvee_{q,q'\in Q, q\neq q} H_q(s,t)\land H_{q'} (s,t))&lt;/math&gt;

* ζ states that at some point M is in a halting state:

: &lt;math&gt;\exists s \exists t \bigvee_{q\in Q_a\cup Q_r} H_q (s,t)&lt;/math&gt;

* θ consists of a conjunction of sentences stating that T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s and H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'s are well behaved with respect to the transitions of M. As an example, let δ(q,0)=(q',1, left) meanining that if M is in state q reading 0, then it writes 1, moves the head one position to the left and goes into the state q'. We represent this condition by the disjunction of θ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_0 \equiv \forall s \forall t (s\neq \underline{min} \land T_0(s,t) \land H_q (s, t)) \to \theta_2&lt;/math&gt;

Where θ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is:

: &lt;math&gt;T_1 (s, t+1)\land H_{q'} (s-1, t+1)\land \forall s' (s\neq s' \to (\bigwedge_{i=0,1} T_i (s', t+1)\leftrightarrow T_i(s',t)))&lt;/math&gt;

And:

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_1 \equiv \forall s \forall t (s = \underline{min} \land T_0(s,t) \land H_q (s, t)) \to \theta_3&lt;/math&gt;

Where θ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is:

&lt;math&gt;T_1 (s, t+1)\land H_{q'} (s, t+1)\land \forall s' (s\neq s' \to (\bigwedge_{i=0,1} T_i (s', t+1)\leftrightarrow T_i(s',t)))&lt;/math&gt;

s-1 and t+1 are first-order definable abbreviations for the predecessor and successor according to the ordering &lt;. The sentence θ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; assures that the tape content in position s changes from 0 to 1, the state changes from q to q', the rest of the tape remains the same and that the head moves to s-1 (i. e. one position to the left), assuming s is not the first position in the tape. If it is, then all is handled by θ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: everything is the same, except the head does not move to the left but stays put.

If φ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; has a finite model, then such a model that represents a computation of M (that starts with the empty tape (i.e. tape containing all zeros) and ends in a halting state). If M halts on the empty input, then the set of all configurations of the halting computations of M (coded with &lt;, T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s and H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'s) is a model of φ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, which is finite, since the set of all configurations of halting computations is finite. It follows that M halts on the empty input iff φ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; has a finite model. Since halting on the empty input is undecidable, so is the question of whether φ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; has a finite model &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; (equivalently, whether φ&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; is finitely satisfiable) is also undecidable (recursively enumerable, but not recursive). This concludes the proof.

'''Corollary'''

: The set of finitely satisfiable sentences is recursively enumerable.

'''Proof'''

Enumerate all pairs &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{A}, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is finite and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}\models \phi&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Corollary'''

: For any vocabulary containing at least one binary relation symbol, the set of all finitely valid sentences is not recursively enumerable.

'''Proof'''

From the previous lemma, the set of finitely satisfiable sentences is recursively enumerable. Assume that the set of all finitely valid sentences is recursively enumerable. Since ¬φ is finitely valid iff φ is not finitely satisfiable, we conclude that the set of sentences which are not finitely satisfiable is recursively enumerable. If both a set A and its complement are recursively enumerable, then A is recursive. It follows that the set of finitely satisfiable sentences is recursive, which contradicts Trakhtenbrot's theorem.

However, it is distinguished by its slower, delayed repolarization phase, variability in shape and amplitude, and the decrease in its velocity with increasing distance from the initial point.&lt;ref&gt;Davies E (2006) Electrical signals in plants: facts and hypotheses.

Variation potentials are distinct from action potentials in their cause of stimulation. Depolarization arises from an increase in plant cell [[turgor pressure]] from a hydraulic pressure wave that moves through the [[xylem]] after events like rain, embolism, bending, local wounds, organ excision, and local burning. Unlike action potentials, variation potentials are not all or nothing.

Depolarization of a variation potential is determined by the difference in pressure between the atmosphere and the plant's intact interior. However, it has been shown that variation potentials can be suppressed by high humidity and continued darkness. The ionic mechanism is assumed to involve a brief shutdown of the [[Proton ATPase|P-type H+ -ATPase]] in the [[plasma membrane]]. 

Variation potential propagation is accomplished hydraulically by moving with a rapid pressure increase that establishes an axial pressure gradient in the xylem. This gradient transforms with distance into increasing lag phases for the pressure-induced depolarization in the epidermal cells. This allows for communication between the leaf and stem that can move in both directions along the axis of the plant.
