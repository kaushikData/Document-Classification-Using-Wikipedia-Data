An '''anticrystal''' is a theoretical solid that is completely disordered, making it the opposite of a [[crystal]]. The mechanical properties of even a slightly disordered solid can have more in common with an anticrystal than with a crystal.

All naturally occurring crystals contain disordered areas (defects). Scientific descriptions typically assume a perfect crystal, extrapolating from that point based on defect prevalence. However, given sufficient defects, extrapolation from perfect crystals fails. [[Amorphous]] materials may display regions with atoms in repeating patterns, but without crystalline order. This means that their properties cannot be inferred from those of a perfect crystal.&lt;ref name=rd1407&gt;{{cite web|author=Mon, 07/07/2014 - 3:12pm |url=http://www.rdmag.com/news/2014/07/consider-%E2%80%9Canticrystal%E2%80%9D |title=Consider the "anticrystal" |publisher=Rdmag.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[phase transition]] that occurs when a fluid becomes a disordered solid under pressure is called the jamming transition. Phase transitions occur when a liquid becomes a solid or a gas. Another way of producing a solid is by putting atoms, molecules or larger particles together under high pressure. Extrapolations from the jamming transition showed that even fairly orderly materials exhibited behaviors closer to those of the anticrystal than a perfect crystal.&lt;ref name=rd1407/&gt;

Anticrystal principles can also provide insight into crystalline materials. For example, strengthening metal [[alloy]]s often involves shrinking their crystalline areas, such that their behaviors are better described by anticrystals.&lt;ref name=rd1407/&gt;

'''The Avion''' is a prototype [[sports car|sports]]car that achieves over 100 [[Miles per gallon|MPG]].{{Clarify|us or imp?|date=October 2009}} The Avion car is based on a simple concept: fuel economy is largely determined by aerodynamic drag and vehicle weight.  The Avion uses existing automotive components, an existing high-efficiency automotive diesel engine and marries them to a lightweight aluminum frame and highly [[automotive aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] composite body. The Avion was an official contender in the [[Progressive Insurance Automotive X Prize]].

== History ==
The Avion was developed in 1979 by Craig Henderson and Bill Green after graduating from [[Western Washington University]] in Bellingham, Washington where they had worked at the [[Vehicle Research Institute]]. The prototype was completed in 1984 and set the [[Guinness world record]] for fuel economy in 1986 at 103.7 mpg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futurecars.com/blog/general-car-blogs/x-prize-profile-avion-car-company |title=Automotive X-Prize Profile: Avion Car Company |publisher=Futurecars.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan, at the time the car was designed, was to manufacture the Avion in limited quantities and sell into the car enthusiast market.  But the real price of gasoline fell steadily from 1979 through the 1980s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/steo/pub/fsheets/real_prices.html |title=EIA - Short-Term Energy Outlook - Real Petroleum Prices |publisher=Eia.doe.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-10-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091022005409/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/steo/pub/fsheets/real_prices.html| archivedate= 22 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and interest in highly fuel-efficient cars disappeared along with the interest of potential investors. 

The dramatic increase in real fuel prices from 2000 to 2008 has renewed interest in automobile fuel economy. The original Avion was taken out of storage and an updated version was entered in the Progressive Automotive X Prize competition. Recent testing, using the original body and replacing the original [[Volkswagen Golf|Volkswagen Rabbit]] diesel engine with the [[Smart Car|Smart Car ForTwo]] diesel show 80 MPG at {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and a remarkable 114 MPG at {{convert|55|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.

== Vehicle ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Avion Typ-1 Wallpaper.jpg|thumb]] --&gt;
The car was designed to be manufactured in small volume using existing automotive components, including a small automotive diesel engine.  A lightweight composite body of highly aerodynamic design is attached to an aluminum frame, and features [[Butterfly doors]].

'''Bitumen-based fuel''' is fuel specifically developed for industrial use.  Raw [[bitumen]], processed from [[Bituminous rocks]], has an extremely high [[viscosity]].

==Properties==
Bitumen has an extremely high [[viscosity]], between 8 and 10 [[API degree]]s (at ambient temperatures), rendering it unusable for use in electric power stations.  Bitumen can be modified by mixing it with fresh water and a small amount of [[phenol]]-based [[surfactant]]. The resulting mixture has properties similar to conventional fuel oil.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

A newer version of bitumen-based fuel has replaced the original version with an [[alcohol]]-based surfactant, making it easier to transport the fuel and eliminating the health concerns associated with the phenol group of surfactants.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Industrial exploitation==
The most well known bitumen-based fuel has been developed by Intevep, the Research and Development Affiliate of [[Petroleos de Venezuela]] SA (PDVSA), in a collaboration with [[BP]],&lt;ref name="ashmar"&gt;[[#ashmar|Ashmar (2010)]], pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; and is branded "[[Orimulsion]]."  It is an [[emulsion]] of [[natural bitumen]] mined from the [[Orinoco Belt]] and fresh water. 

Bitumen-based fuel is currently used as a commercial boiler fuel in power plants in [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Lithuania]], and [[China]]. Commonly available air pollutant control technology can limit emissions from Orimulsion to levels considered [[Best Available Control Technology]], as defined by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]].

'''Calcium hydride''' is the [[chemical compound]] with the formula CaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and is therefore an [[alkaline earth hydride]]. This grey powder (white if pure, which is rare) reacts vigorously with water liberating [[hydrogen]] gas. CaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is thus used as a drying agent, i.e. a [[desiccant]].&lt;ref name=eEROS&gt;Gawley, R. E., Davis, A., "Calcium Hydride," in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, 2001, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.  {{DOI|10.1002/047084289X.rc005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a saline hydride, meaning that its structure is salt-like. The alkali metals and the alkaline earth metals heavier than beryllium all form saline hydrides. A well-known example is [[sodium hydride]], which crystallizes in the NaCl motif. These species are insoluble in all solvents with which they do not react. CaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; crystallizes in the PbCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[cotunnite]]) [[crystal structure|structure]].&lt;ref&gt;Wells, A.F. (1984) Structural Inorganic Chemistry, Oxford: Clarendon Press. {{ISBN|0-19-855370-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
Calcium hydride is prepared from its elements by direct combination of calcium and hydrogen at 300 to 400 °C.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Peter Rittmeyer, Ulrich Wietelmann “Hydrides” in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a13_199}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Uses==
===Reduction of metal oxides===
CaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a reducing agent for the production of metal powders from the oxides of Ti, V, Nb, Ta, and U.  It is proposed to operate via its decomposition to Ca metal:&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;
:TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 CaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   Ti  +  2 CaO  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Hydrogen source===
CaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been used for hydrogen production. In the 1940s, it was available under the trade name "Hydrolith"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hydrolith Hydrolith] in thefreedictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; as a source of hydrogen:&lt;blockquote&gt;
'The trade name for this compound is "hydrolith"; in cases of emergency, it can be used as a portable source of hydrogen, for filling airships. It is rather expensive for this use.'&lt;ref&gt;Adlam G.H.J. and Price L.S., ''A Higher School Certificate Inorganic Chemistry'', John Murray, London, 1940&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;The reference to "emergency" probably refers to wartime use. The compound has, however, been widely used for decades as a safe and convenient means to inflate weather balloons. Likewise, it is regularly used in laboratories to produce small quantities of highly pure hydrogen for experiments.  The moisture content of diesel fuel is estimated by the hydrogen evolved upon treatment with CaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

===Desiccant===
The reaction of CaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with water can be represented as follows:
:CaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The two hydrolysis products, gaseous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[calcium hydroxide|Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], are readily separated from the dried solvent.

Calcium hydride is a relatively mild desiccant and, compared to [[molecular sieve]]s, probably inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, D. B. G., Lawton, M., "Drying of Organic Solvents: Quantitative Evaluation of the Efficiency of Several Desiccants", The Journal of Organic Chemistry 2010, vol. 75, 8351. {{DOI| 10.1021/jo101589h}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its use is safer than more reactive agents such as [[sodium]] metal or [[NaK|sodium-potassium alloy]]. Calcium hydride is widely used as a [[desiccant]] for [[base (chemistry)|basic]] solvents such as [[amine]]s and [[pyridine]]. It is also used to dry alcohols.&lt;ref name=eEROS/&gt;

Despite its convenience, CaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a few drawbacks:
*It is insoluble in all solvents with which it does not react vigorously, in contrast to [[Lithium aluminium hydride|LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], thus the speed of its drying action can be slow.
*Because CaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[calcium hydroxide|Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] are almost indistinguishable in appearance, the quality of a sample of CaH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not obvious visually.

===Sonar decoy===
During the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], German submarines used calcium hydride as a [[sonar decoy]] called [[Bold (decoy)|bold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-sXFBQAAQBAJ|title=An Encyclopedia of the History of Technology|isbn=9781134981649|last1=McNeil|first1=Ian|date=2002-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dugout canoe''' or simply '''dugout''' is a [[boat]] made from a hollowed tree trunk. Other names for this type of boat are '''logboat''' and '''monoxylon'''. ''Monoxylon'' (''μονόξυλον'') (pl: ''monoxyla'') is Greek -- ''mono-'' (single) + ''[[wikt:ξύλον|ξύλον]] xylon'' (tree) -- and is mostly used in classic Greek texts. In Germany they are called '''einbaum''' ("one tree" in English). Some, but not all, [[pirogue]]s are also constructed in this manner.

Dugouts are the oldest [[boat]]s archaeologists have found, dating back about 8,000 years to the Neolithic [[Stone Age]].&lt;ref&gt;1000 Inventions and Discoveries, by Roger Bridgman&lt;/ref&gt; This is probably because they are made of massive pieces of wood, which tend to preserve better than, e.g., bark [[canoe]]s. Along with bark [[canoe]] and hide [[kayak]], dugout boats were also used by [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]].

==Construction==
[[File:Dugout canoe on land.jpg|thumb|Building a seagoing dugout. The sides have likely been heated and bent outward.]]

Construction of a dugout begins with the selection of a log of suitable dimensions. Sufficient wood needed to be removed  to make the vessel relatively light in weight and buoyant, yet still strong enough to support the crew and cargo. Specific types of wood were often preferred based on their strength, durability, and density. The shape of the boat is then fashioned to minimize drag, with sharp ends at the bow and stern.

First the bark is removed from the exterior. Before the appearance of metal tools, dugouts were hollowed out using controlled fires. The burnt wood was then removed using an [[adze]]. Another method using tools is to chop out parallel notches across the interior span of the wood, then split out and remove the wood from between the notches. Once hollowed out, the interior was dressed and smoothed out with a knife or adze.

More primitive designs keep the tree's original dimensions, with a round bottom. However, it is possible to carefully steam the sides of the hollow log until they are pliable, then bend to create a more flat-bottomed "boat" shape with a wider beam in the centre.

For travel in the rougher waters of the ocean, dugouts can be fitted with outriggers. One or two smaller logs are mounted parallel to the main hull by long poles. In the case of two [[outrigger]]s, one is mounted on either side of the hull.

==Africa==
The [[Dufuna canoe]] from Nigeria is an 8000-year-old dugout, the oldest boat discovered in Africa, and the third-oldest worldwide.
The well-watered [[Tropical rainforests|tropical rainforest]] and [[Miombo|woodland]] regions of sub-Saharan Africa provide both the waterways and the trees for dugout canoes, which are commonplace from the [[Limpopo River basin]] in the south through [[East Africa|East]] and [[Central Africa]] and across to [[West Africa]]. [[African Teak]] is the timber favoured for their construction, though this comprises a number of different species, and is in short supply in some areas. Dugouts are paddled across deep lakes and rivers or punted through channels in swamps (see ''[[makoro]]'') or in shallow areas, and are used for transport, fishing and hunting, including, in the past, the very dangerous [[Water Transport in Zambia#Dugout canoes|hunting of hippopotamus]]. Dugouts are called [[pirogue]]s in [[Francophone]] areas of Africa.

==Asia==
[[File:Dugout Canoe Excavated at Kuahuqiao Site of Hangzhou 02 2014-07.JPG|thumb|Remains of an 8000-year-old dugout excavated in China]]

An 8000-year-old dugout canoe was found by archaeologists in [[Kuahuqiao]], [[Zhejiang Province]], in east China.&lt;ref&gt;Leping Jiang &amp; Li Liu, [http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/liu305/ The discovery of an 8000-year-old dugout canoe at Kuahuqiao in the Lower Yangzi River, China.] 2005 antiquity.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt; This is the earliest canoe found in Asia.

The Moken, an ethnic group that lives in Myanmar's Mergui Archipelago and the north of Thailand as sea nomads, still builds and uses dugout canoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burmaboating.com/cruising-area/|title=Mergui Archipelago|work=Burma Boating: Sailing Holidays, Yacht Charters and Private Cruises in Myanmar &amp; Beyond}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Moken's accounts of their people's origin, a mythical queen punished the forbidden love of their ancestral forefather for his sister-in-law by banishing him and his descendants to life on sea in dugout canoes with indentations fore and aft ("a mouth that eats and a rear that defecates"), symbolizing the unending cycle of ingestion, digestion and evacuation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burmaboating.com/the-mergui-archipelago-and-the-moken/|title=The Mergui Archipelago and The Moken|work=Burma Boating: Sailing Holidays, Yacht Charters and Private Cruises in Myanmar &amp; Beyond}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A centuries-old unfinished dugout boat, a big banca (five tons, measuring 8 by 2 by 1.5 meters) was accidentally retrieved on November, 2010 by Mayor Ricardo Revita at Barangay Casanicolasan, [[Rosales, Pangasinan]], [[Philippines]], in Lagasit River, near [[Agno River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/632462/centuries-old-wooden-boat-retrieved-pangasinan|title=Centuries-old wooden boat retrieved in Pangasinan|work=philstar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now on display in front of the Municipal Town Hall.

In ancient many dugouts were made from [[Tilia cordata|linden wood]], for several reasons. First, was abundant in the Paleolithic after the melting of the [[Last glacial period|Weichselian glaciation]] and readily available. Secondly it grew to be one of the tallest trees in the forests of the time, making it easier to build longer boats. Linden wood also lends itself well to carving and doesn't split or crack easily. It is lighter and therefore boats made from it have a better cargo capacity and are easier to carry, than most other tree types from the European [[old-growth forest]]s.

The [[Pesse canoe]], found in the [[Netherlands]], is a dugout which is believed to be the world's oldest boat, carbon dated to between 8040 BCE and 7510 BCE. Other dugouts discovered in the Netherlands include two in the province of [[North Holland]]: in 2003, near [[Uitgeest]], dated at 617-600 BC;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://collectie.huisvanhilde.nl/#3e67367a-130e-4c79-b4c0-042b50db4c32 |title=Kano |website=[[Huis van Hilde]] |language=Dutch |accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007, near [[Den Oever]], dated at 3300-3000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://collectie.huisvanhilde.nl/#fe19ab24-31e5-46f0-8942-7de6edf3d4bd |title=Kano |website=[[Huis van Hilde]] |language=Dutch |accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dugouts have also been found in [[Germany]]. In [[German language|German]], the craft are known as ''einbaum'' (one-tree). In the old Hanseatic town of [[Stralsund]] three log-boats were excavated in 2002. Two of the boats were around 7,000 years old and are the oldest boats found in the Baltic area. The third boat (6,000 years old) was 12 meters long and holds the record as the longest dugout in the region. The finds have partly deteriorated due to poor storage conditions.

In 1991, remains of a linden wood log-boat of nearly 6 meters were found at [[Männedorf]]-Strandbad in [[Switzerland]] at [[Lake Zürich]]. The boat has since been dated to be 6,500 years old.

In 1902 an oak log boat over 15m long and 1m wide, was found at [[Addergoole Bog]], [[Lurgan]], [[County Galway]], Ireland and delivered to the [[National Museum of Ireland]]. The Lurgan boat radiocarbon date was 3940 +/- 25 BP. The boat has holes suggesting that it had an outrigger or was joined to another boat.

In 2012, at [[Parc Glyndwr]], [[Monmouth]], Monmouthshire, Wales, UK, an excavation by Monmouth Archeological Society, revealed three ditches suggesting a Neolithic dugout trimaran of similar length to the Lurgan log boat, carbon dated 3700+/-35 BP.&lt;ref&gt;Clark S, Monmouth Archeological Society.

''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' details how the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] built monoxyla that they sold to [[Rus people|Rus']] in [[Kiev]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/dwaugh/rus/texts/constp.html|title=0f the Pechenegs, and how many advantages|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ships were then used against the [[Byzantine Empire]] during the [[Rus'–Byzantine War (860)|Rus'–Byzantine Wars]] of the 9th and 10th centuries. They used dugouts to attack [[Constantinople]] and to withdraw into their lands with bewildering speed and mobility. Hence, the name of Δρομίται ("people on the run") applied to the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]] in some Byzantine sources. The monoxyla were often accompanied by larger galleys, that served as command and control centres. Each Slavic dugout could hold from 40 to 70 warriors.

The [[Cossacks]] of the [[Zaporozhian Host]] were also renowned for their artful use of dugouts, which issued from the [[Dnieper]] to raid the shores of the [[Black Sea]] in the 16th and 17th centuries. Using small, shallow-draft, and highly maneuverable galleys known as ''chaiky'', they moved swiftly across the Black Sea. According to the Cossacks' own records, these vessels, carrying a 50 to 70 man crew, could reach the coast of [[Anatolia]] from the [[Berezan Island|mouth of the Dnieper River]] in forty hours.

More than 40 pre-historic log-boats have been found in the [[Czech Republic]]. The latest discovery was in 1999 of a 10 m long log-boat in [[Mohelnice (Šumperk District)]]. It was cut out of a single oak log and has a width of 1.05 m. The log-boat has been dated to around 1,000 BC and is kept at the 'Mohelnice Muzeum' (Museum of National History). Geographically, Czech log-boat sites and remains are clustered along the [[Elbe]] and [[Morava (river)|Morava]] Rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1365226/Logboats_from_Bohemia_and_Moravia_Czech_Republic|title=Logboats from Bohemia and Moravia, Czech Republic|author=Jason Rogers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poland is known for the socalled ''Lewin''-type log-boats, found at [[Lewin Brzeski]], [[Koźle]] and [[Roszowicki Las]] accordingly. These boats, are characterized by square or trapezoidal cross-section, rectangular hull-ends and low height of the sides in relation to vessel length. In addition, nearly all the Lewin-type boats have a single hole in the bow and two at the stern. The low height is a result of the parent log being split lengthwise in half, in order to obtain two identical timbers from a single trunk. The advantage lies in the resulting identical twin hulls, which are then joined to form a double-hulled raft. The paired hulls were joined by transverse poles, which did not go through the holes in the platform ends but were fastened to the top walls or in special grooves at the hull ends. These vessels were typically 7–12 m in length, and the largest of them could carry up to 1.5 tons of cargo because of the special design. The Lewin type logboats are usually associated with the [[Przeworsk culture]] in the early centuries AD.

Many pre-historic dugout boats have been found in [[Scandinavia]]. These boats were used for transport on calmer bodies of water, fishing and maybe occasionally for whaling and sealing. Dugouts require no metal parts, and were common amongst the [[Nordic Stone Age|Stone Age]] people in Northern Europe until large trees suitable for making this type of watercraft became scarce. Length was limited to the size of trees in the old-growth forests—up to {{convert|12|m|ft}} in length. In [[Denmark]] in 2001 and some years prior to that, a few dugout canoes of [[Tilia cordata|linden wood]], was unearthed in a large scale archaeological excavation project in Egådalen, just north of [[Aarhus]]. They have been carbon dated to the years 5210-4910 BCE and they are the oldest known boats in [[Northern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hum.au.dk/moesgaard/motorvejen/gammel/dk020302.html|title=Arkæologien under motorvejen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/10/1062902114336.html|title='Viking era' dugout boat found in Norway|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later models increased freeboard (and seaworthiness) by lashing additional boards to the side of the boat. Eventually, the dugout portion was reduced to a solid [[keel]], and the lashed boards on the sides became a [[Clinker (boat building)|Lapstrake]] hull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jasen01/texts/longship.htm|title=The Viking Longship|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], two log boats were discovered in [[Newport, Shropshire]] and are now on display at [[Harper Adams University]] Newport. The [[Iron Age]] residents of [[Great Britain]], were known to have used logboats for fishing and basic trade. In 1964, a logboat was uncovered in [[Poole Harbour]], [[Dorset]]. The [[Poole Logboat]] dated to 300 BC, was large enough to accommodate 18 people and was constructed from a giant [[oak tree]]. It is currently located in the [[Poole]] Museum. An even older logboat (the [[Hanson Log Boat|Hanson log boat]]) was unearthed in 1998 in Shardlow south of [[Derby]]. It has been dated to the [[Bronze Age]]s around 1.500 BC and is now exhibited at [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]]. There was another pre-historic boat at the same location, but it was buried ''[[in situ]]''.

In [[Northern Europe]], the tradition of making dugout canoes survived into the 20th and 21st centuries only in [[Estonia]], where seasonal floods in [[Soomaa]], a 390&amp;nbsp;km² [[wilderness]] area, make conventional means of transportation impossible. In recent decades a new surge of interest in making dugouts ([[Estonian language|Estonian]] ''haabjas'') has revitalized the ancient tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haabjas.blogspot.com/|title=Haabjas - Estonian Dugout Canoe|author=Aivar Ruukel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Americas==
{{main article|Pacific Northwest canoes}}
[[File:Dugout canoe manner boats de bry.jpg|thumb|Native Americans making a dugout canoe, 1590]]

Dugout canoes were constructed throughout the Americas, where suitable logs were available. The [[Indigenous peoples of North America|indigenous people]] of the [[Pacific Northwest]] are very skilled at crafting wood. Best known for [[totem pole]]s up to {{convert|80|ft|m}} tall, they also construct dugout canoes over {{convert|60|ft|m}} long for everyday use and ceremonial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mle.matsuk12.us/american-natives/nw/nw.html|title=Meadow Lakes Elementary / Overview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Geordie Tocher and two companions sailed a {{convert|3.5|ST|MT|adj=on}}, {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} dugout canoe (the ''Orenda II''), made of [[Douglas fir]], and based on [[Haida people|Haida]] designs (but with sails), from [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada to [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] to add credibility to stories that the Haida had travelled to Hawai{{okina}}i in ancient times. Altogether they ventured some 4,500&amp;nbsp;miles (7,242&amp;nbsp;km) after two months at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Stall |title=A man, a tree and an ocean to cross |journal=Maclean's |date=5 March 1979 |pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Sp{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Speck |title=Orenda recalled |work=North Shore News |date=22 November 1978 |pages=2 and 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dugout canoes were made mostly of huge cedar logs in the state of Washington for the ocean travellers, but natives that lived on the smaller rivers used smaller cedar logs.

==Pacific Islands==

[[File:Maori canoe (waka) in the Otago Museum, 2016-01-29.jpg|thumb|right|Māori [[Waka (canoe)|waka]] canoe in a museum]]

In the [[Pacific Island]]s, dugout canoes are very large, made from whole mature trees and fitted with [[outrigger]]s for increased stability in the ocean, and were once used for long-distance travel. Such are the very large [[Waka (canoe)|waka]] used by [[Māori people|Māori]] who came to [[New Zealand]] probably from East Polynesia, about 1280. Such vessels carried 40 to 80 warriors in calm sheltered coastal waters or rivers. It is believed that trans-ocean voyages were made in Polynesian catamarans and one hull, carbon-dated to about 1400, was found in New Zealand in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Johns D. A., Irwin G. J. and Sung Y. K. (2014) [http://www.pnas.org/content/111/41/14728.full "An early sophisticated East Polynesian voyaging canoe discovered on New Zealand's coast"] ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', '''111''' (41): 14728–14733. {{doi|10.1073/pnas.1408491111}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand smaller waka were made from a single log, often [[Podocarpus totara|Totara]], because of its lightness, strength and resistance to rotting. Larger waka were made of about seven parts lashed together with flax rope. All waka are characterized by very low freeboard. In [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]], ''wa{{okina}}a'' (canoes) are traditionally manufactured from the trunk of the ''[[Acacia koa|koa]]'' tree. They typically carry a crew of six: one steersman and five paddlers.

The [[Pacific Ocean]] has been the nursery for many different forms of dugout sailing craft.  They differ in their sail plan (''i.e.'', crab-claw or half-crab-claw, Latin, or triangular), hull formats (single,  double, catamaran or proa), the absence or presence of a beam (a bridge for a double hull). Hull shapes and end forms vary greatly.  Masts can "be right or made of double spars."  Hulls can be constructed by assembling boards or digging out tree trunks. Intended use (fish, war, sea voyage) and geographical features (beach, lagoon, reefs) are reflected in design. Importantly, there is an important dividing line: some craft use a [[Tacking (sailing)|tacking rig]]; others "shunt" that is change tack "by reversing the sail from one end of the hull to the other."  Tacking rigs are similar to those seen in most parts of the world, but shunting rigs change tack by reversing the sail from one end of the hull to the other and sailing in the opposite direction (the "[[Pushmi-pullyu]]" of the sailing world).&lt;ref name="Louis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philateliemarine.fr/phil_mar_e/canoes.htm |title=Pacific islands sailing canoes |first1=Jean |last1=Louis |publisher=webring.com   |accessdate=January 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==John F. Kennedy's PT-109==
The [[Solomon Island]]ers have used and continue to use dugout canoes to travel between islands. In [[World War II]] these were used during the Japanese occupation - with their small visual and noise signatures these were among the smallest boats used by the Allied forces in World War II. After the sinking of [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT-109]], [[Biuku Gasa]] reached the shipwrecked [[John F. Kennedy]] by dugout.

'''Elias Panayiotis Gyftopoulos''' ({{lang-gr|Ηλίας Παναγιώτης Γυφτόπουλος}}; July 4, 1927{{spaced ndash}}June 23, 2012) was a Greek-American engineer who contributed to [[thermodynamics]] both in its general formulation and its quantum foundations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2012/obit-gyftopoulos.html Professor emeritus Elias P. Gyftopoulos dies at 84] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]; by Alissa Mallinson and Ilavenil Subbiah; published June 27, 2012; retrieved May 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Gyftopoulos received an undergraduate degree in [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[electrical engineering]] in 1953 from the [[National Technical University of Athens]], and a [[Doctor of Science]] degree in electrical engineering at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1958. At MIT, he initially focused on [[nuclear reactor]] safety and control. After meeting professors [[George N. Hatsopoulos]] and [[Joseph Henry Keenan|Joseph H. Keenan]],&lt;ref name=KeenanHatsopoulos&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hatsopoulos|first1=G. N.|last2=Keenan|first2=J.

'''Gelcoat''' or 'Gel Coat' is a material used to provide a high-quality finish on the visible surface of a [[Fibre-reinforced plastic|fibre-reinforced composite]]. The most common gelcoats are [[thermosetting polymer]]s based on [[epoxy]] or unsaturated [[polyester resin]] chemistry. Gelcoats are modified resins which are applied to [[moulding (process)|mould]]s in the liquid state. They are cured to form crosslinked [[polymer]]s and are subsequently backed with [[thermoset polymer matrix]] composites which are often mixtures of polyester resin and [[fiberglass]], or epoxy resin which is most commonly used with carbon fibre for higher specific strength. 

The manufactured component, when sufficiently [[Curing (chemistry)|cured]] and removed from the mould, presents the gelcoated surface. This is usually [[pigment]]ed to provide a coloured, glossy surface which improves the aesthetic appearance of the article, such as the surface of a boat hull. 

Many marine craft and some aircraft are manufactured using composite materials with an outer layer of gelcoat, typically 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm to 0.8&amp;nbsp;mm (0.02&amp;nbsp;in to 0.03&amp;nbsp;in) thick. Gelcoats are designed to be durable, providing resistance to [[ultraviolet]] degradation and [[hydrolysis]]. 

Specialized gelcoats can be used to manufacture the moulds which in turn are used to manufacture components. These require very high levels of durability to overcome the mechanical and thermal [[stress (physics)|stresses]] encountered during the curing and demoulding processes.  

Suitable resin chemistries for the manufacture of gelcoats vary, but the most commonly encountered are [[saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] polyesters or epoxies. Within each of these categories, the resin chemistries are further subdivided.

In addition to any pigment a gelcoat will, if necessary, contain a [[Thixotropy|thixotropic]] additive to assist its tenacity to vertical portions of the mould whilst it cures.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Handcycle.jpg|thumb|300px|A competition handcycle]] --&gt;

A '''handcycle''' is a type of [[human-powered land vehicle]] powered by the [[arm]]s rather than the [[Human leg|legs]], as on a [[bicycle]].  Most handcycles are [[tricycle]] in form, with two coasting rear [[Bicycle wheel|wheels]] and one steerable powered front wheel. Despite usually having three wheels, they are also known as ''handbikes''.

==Description==
[[Image:rainbow h.jpg|thumb|300px|Hand trike]]
Many manufacturers have designed and released hand-powered [[Recumbent bicycle|recumbent]] trikes, or handcycles. Handcycles are a regular sight at [[Human Powered Vehicle#Human-powered surface vehicles|HPV]] meets and are beginning to be seen on the streets. They commonly follow a delta design with front wheels driven by standard [[Derailleur gears|derailleur gearing]] powered by hand [[Crankset|cranks]]. [[Bicycle brake systems|Brake]] levers are usually mounted on the handholds which are usually mounted [[Phase (waves)#Phase difference|in phase]], unlike [[Bicycle pedal|pedal]] cranks, which are usually 180° out of phase. This allows the rider to more easily use their torso to help propel the cycle. The entire crank assembly and the front wheel turn together, allowing the rider to steer and crank simultaneously.

Some designs use two front wheels and a single rear wheel, while others use lean-steer designs.

A handcycle is not a [[wheelchair]], handcycle has a crank and gears, while a wheelchair has push-rims directly on the main wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles==
Handcycles come in a variety of styles, making them accessible to people with a wide variety of [[disibility|disabilities]]. There are also hybrids between a handcycle, a recumbent bike and a tricycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.berkelbike.co.uk | title = BerkelBike | accessdate = 2009-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fork steer===
Fork steer handcycles represent the majority of handcycles sold. They work well for both low and high-level spinal injuries, and most have adjustable footrests, seat angle, and come with a variety of gearing, [[Bicycle wheel|wheel]] and [[Bicycle tire|tire]] configurations depending on intended use: racing, recreation, or touring.  Manufacturers of this type of handcycle include Invacare (Top End), Intrepid Equipment, Varna, Schmicking and Sunrise Medical (Quickie).

===Lean steer===
Riders turn lean steer handcycles by leaning into the turn. There is a longer learning curve with lean steer handcycles and they are significantly less stable at high speed. The lean steer system feels similar to mono skiing: using your whole body to steer the handcycle. Lean steer handcycles can work well for lower-level injuries; although, some athletes with high-level disability use them as well. Manufacturers of this type of handcycle include Lighting Handcycles and Brike International Ltd. (Freedom Ryder).

Another type of lean steer hand trike has two steering rear wheels and one non-steerable, powered front wheel with handholds offset at 180°, similar to [[Bicycle pedal|pedal]] cranks, that can be operated with only one hand, thus making it easy to ride on an up-hill{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}, and it can be ridden in a tighter curve with the automatic rear wheels steering system.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Image:mountaintrike.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An "off road" handcycle, designed in the Netherlands]]

===Off road===
The off-road is different from other handcycles in that there are two wheels in front and one behind, and it has a lower gear ratio range.  This gives the cycle the ability to tackle steep slopes and permits handcycle [[mountain biking]].  The addition of a wider tire with suitable tread makes some mountain biking possible on standard road bikes.

===Touring===
Handcycles have also been used for [[Bicycle touring|touring]], and to better accommodate this interest, some manufacturers incorporate mudguards and pannier cargo racks. As handcycles have evolved they have become progressively lighter, and they have better gearing for long climbs and long distance touring.

'''Hypatia''' is a small stone, thought to be the first known specimen of a [[comet nucleus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sci-news.com/space/science-libyan-desert-glass-diamond-bearing-pebble-evidence-comet-01446.html|title=Libyan desert glass: Diamond-Bearing Pebble Provides Evidence of Comet Striking Earth|work=sci-news.com, 8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ScD"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180109112437.htm|title=Extra-terrestrial Hypatia stone rattles solar system status quo|work=ScienceDaily.com, 9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
Hypatia was discovered in December 1996 by Aly A. Barakat at {{coord|25|20|N|25|30|E|display=inline}}, in the same area where [[Libyan desert glass]] is found.&lt;ref name="paper"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X13004998 |title=Unique chemistry of a diamond-bearing pebble from the Libyan Desert Glass strewnfield, SW Egypt: Evidence for a shocked comet fragment |doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2013.09.003 |bibcode=2013E&amp;PSL.382...21K |volume=382 |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |pages=21–31|year=2013 |last1=Kramers |first1=Jan D |last2=Andreoli |first2=Marco A.G |last3=Atanasova |first3=Maria |last4=Belyanin |first4=Georgy A |last5=Block |first5=David L |last6=Franklyn |first6=Chris |last7=Harris |first7=Chris |last8=Lekgoathi |first8=Mpho |last9=Montross |first9=Charles S |last10=Ntsoane |first10=Tshepo |last11=Pischedda |first11=Vittoria |last12=Segonyane |first12=Patience |last13=Viljoen |first13=K.S. (Fanus) |last14=Westraadt |first14=Johan E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The rock has been named after [[Hypatia|Hypatia of Alexandria]] ({{abbr|c.|circa}}&amp;nbsp;350–370&amp;nbsp;AD&amp;nbsp;– 415&amp;nbsp;AD)&amp;nbsp;– the outstanding philosopher, astronomer, [[mathematician]], and inventor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=11974415 |title=Incredible diamond-studded 'alien' rock has minerals not found anywhere in our star system |last=Collins |first=Tim |date=2018-01-12 |work=NZ&amp;nbsp;Herald |access-date=2018-01-13 |language=en-NZ |issn=1170-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Tests done in South Africa {{by whom?|date=September 2018}} show that Hypatia contains microscopic [[diamond]]s and that it is of extraterrestrial origin. It is thought to have been part of the body whose impact caused the creation of [[Libyan desert glass]].&lt;ref name="paper"/&gt; It probably fell to Earth about 28 million years ago.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It has a very unusual chemical composition, parts of it could be older than the solar system.&lt;ref name="ScD" /&gt;

In 2018 Georgy Belyanin of the university of Johannesburg and colleages have found compounds including polyaromatic hydrocarbons and silicon carbide associated with a nickel phosphide compound not found in the solar system before. Other facts supporting the otherworldly origin of the stone include ratios of silicon to carbon opposite to those of Earth, Mars or Venus, but consistent with [[interstellar dust]].&lt;ref&gt;2018 Journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta '''223''' 462. (Quotation from [[CERN Courier]] March 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IEC voltage ranges}}
[[International Standard]] '''IEC 60038:1983''' defines a set of standard voltages for use in [[low voltage]] and [[high voltage]] [[alternating current|AC]] [[electricity supply]] systems.

== Low voltage ==
Where two voltages are given below separated by "/", the first is the [[root-mean-square]] voltage between a phase and the neutral connector, whereas the second is the corresponding [[root-mean-square]] voltage between two phases (exception: the category shown below called "One Phase", where 240 V is the root-mean-square voltage between the two legs of a [[split phase]]). The three-phase voltages are for use in either four-wire (with neutral) or three-wire (without neutral) systems.

=== Three-phase 50 Hz ===
* 230 V / 400 V (formerly 220/380V)
* 400 V / 690 V (formerly 380/660V)
* 1000 V phase to phase (3 wire)

Suppliers using 220 V / 380 V or 240 V / 415 V systems were expected by the standard to migrate to the recommended value of 230 V / 400 V by the year 2003. This migration has already been largely completed, at least within the European Union.

=== Voltage conversion schedule ===
{| class=wikitable
! Year !! Neutral-Phase [V] / Phase-Phase [V] !! 
|-
| &amp;mdash; 1987      || 220 V / 380 V || – 10% .. +10% &lt;ref name=sitech/&gt;
|-
| 1988 &amp;mdash; 2003 || 230 V / 400 V || – 10% .. + 6% &lt;ref name=sitech/&gt;
|-
| 2003 &amp;mdash;      || 230 V / 400 V || – 10% .. +10% &lt;ref name=sitech/&gt;
|}

=== Three-phase 60 Hz ===
* 120 V / 208 V
* 240 V
* 277 V / 480 V
* 480 V
* 347 V / 600 V
* 600 V / 1000 V

=== One-phase, three-wire 60 Hz (American split-phase) ===
* 120 V / 240 V

== Medium voltage ==
Table 3 of IEC 60038 lists nominal voltages above 1 kV and not exceeding 35 kV. There are two series, one from 3 kV up to 35 kV and another one from 4.16 kV up to 34.5 kV.

== High voltage ==
Table 4 shows nominal voltages above 35 kV and not exceeding 230 kV.

== Extra-high voltage == 
Table 5 is systematically different, as the highest voltage for equipment is the characteristic value exceeding 245 kV. The enumeration begins at 300 kV and ends with 1200 kV.

'''International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties 1969''' ('''INTERVENTION 1969''') is an international maritime convention affirming the right of a coastal State to "take such measures on the [[high seas]] as may be necessary to prevent, mitigate or eliminate grave and imminent danger to their coastline or related interests from [[Oil spill|pollution or threat of pollution of the sea by oil]], following upon a maritime casualty or acts related to such a casualty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%20970/volume-970-I-14049-English.pdf Article 1 of the International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The 1967 [[Torrey Canyon]] disaster when the [[oil spill]]ed from the tanker severely damaged coastal and marine environment and wildlife of the coastal State signalled a need to empower coastal State to take necessary measures to protect itself from pollution incidents outside this State's territory, i.e. on the [[high seas]]. In doing so, it was also deemed necessary to protect the legitimate interests of [[ship-owner]]s, cargo owners and the [[flag State]]s and the principle of the [[Freedom of the seas|freedom of the high seas]].

The new Convention was drafted within the framework of the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) and adopted at the international conference in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] in 1969 entering into force in 1975. In 1973 the Protocol relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Marine Pollution by Substances other than Oil was adopted extending the provision of the 1969 Convention to other [[Dangerous goods|hazardous substances]]. The list of hazardous substances covered by Protocol was amended and extended in 1991, 1996 and 2002.

As of October 2016, the convention has 89 state parties.

== Summary of Provisions ==
The Convention applies to all seagoing vessels except [[warship]]s or other vessels owned or operated by a State and used on Government non-commercial service.

While exercising the right to take measures "necessary to prevent, mitigate or eliminate grave and imminent danger to their coastline or related interests" from oil pollution, the coastal State is obligated to:

* Prior to taking measures to consult other affected States, including the [[flag State]], [[ship-owner]], cargo owner and independent experts from the list maintained by the [[International Maritime Organization]] (excluding cases of extreme urgency requiring measures to be taken immediately);&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imo.org/about/conventions/listofconventions/pages/international-convention-relating-to-intervention-on-the-high-seas-in-cases-of-oil-pollution-casualties.aspx IMO summary of the Intervention Convention]
&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use its best endeavours to avoid any risk to human life and to afford persons in distress any assistance which they may need, and in appropriate cases to facilitate the [[repatriation]] of ships crews;
* Notify all interested States, owners of ships and cargoes and the IMO of all measures taken;&lt;ref&gt;Article III of the Intervention Convention&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ensure that all measures are proportionate to actual or threatened damage;&lt;ref&gt;Article V of the Intervention Convention&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pay compensation to the extent of the damage caused by measures which exceed those reasonably necessary to achieve the end.&lt;ref&gt;Article VI of the Intervention Convention&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kand Dam''' is small earth core [[rock-fill dam]] under construction in [[North Waziristan Agency]] of [[FATA]], [[Pakistan]].

The construction of dam started in 2011 and was expected to be complete by September 2014 with projected cost of PKR 198.145 Million. Due to military operations, construction of the dam was suspended in June 2014 at 86% progress. The dam has a height of {{convert|75|ft|m|order=flip}} and a length of {{convert|640|ft|m|order=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatada.gov.pk/project/kand-small-dam-in-north-waziristan-agency/ FATA Development Authority » Kand Small Dam in North Waziristan Agency&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  If completed, the dam would irrigate {{convert|716|acre|ha|order=flip}} of land, with a total water storage capacity of {{convert|3375|acre.ft|m3|order=flip}}, and a catchment area of {{convert|20.75|sqmi|km2|order=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sohnidharti.tv/?p=895 Small dams to irrigate 2,688 acres of land in Waziristan – sohni dharti : sohni dharti&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726120021/http://www.sohnidharti.tv/?p=895 |date=2014-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6726">'''Landfill mining and reclamation''' (LFMR) is a process whereby solid [[waste]]s 
which have previously been [[landfill]]ed are excavated and processed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enviroalternatives.com/landfill.html Landfill Mining] Landfill Mining, Preserving Resources through Integrated Sustainable Management of Waste, Technical Brief from the World Resource Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; The function of landfill mining is to reduce the amount of landfill mass encapsulated within the closed landfill and/or temporarily remove hazardous material to allow protective measures to be taken before the landfill mass is replaced. In the process, mining recovers valuable recyclable materials, a combustible fraction, soil, and landfill space. The aeration of the landfill soil is a secondary benefit regarding the landfill's future use. The combustible fraction is useful for the generation of power. The overall appearance of the landfill mining procedure is a sequence of processing machines laid out in a functional conveyor system. The operating principle is to excavate, sieve and sort the landfill material.

The concept of  mining was introduced as early as 1953 at the [[Hiriya]] landfill operated by the Dan Region Authority next to the city of [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://som.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/reports/themeB/2003/03B39/03b39.pdf Landfill Mining Paper] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061010001855/http://som.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/reports/themeB/2003/03B39/03b39.pdf |date=2006-10-10 }} D.J. van der Zee, ''et al.'' (2004) "Assessing the market opportunities of landfill mining". ''Waste Manag.'' '''24'''(8):795-804.&lt;/ref&gt; Waste contains many resources with high value, the most notable of which are non-ferrous metals such as [[aluminium can]]s and [[scrap metal]]. The concentration of aluminium in many landfills is higher than the concentration of aluminum in [[bauxite]] from which the metal is derived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Landfill mining: new opportunities ahead?|url = http://www.macfarlanes.com/media/1467/landfill-mining-new-opportunities-ahead.pdf|website = macfarlanes.com|publisher = [[Macfarlanes]]|accessdate = 2015-06-11|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150613034513/http://www.macfarlanes.com/media/1467/landfill-mining-new-opportunities-ahead.pdf|archive-date = 2015-06-13|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical applications ==
Landfill mining is also possible in countries where land is not available for new landfill sites. In this instance landfill space can be reclaimed by the extraction of [[biodegradable waste]] and other substances then refilled with wastes requiring disposal.

Mining construction landfill sites is the simplest form of landfill mining. Construction landfills in the United States contain three basic components, wood, scrap metal and gypsum, or drywall, along with a minimal amount of other construction materials. The wood collected can be used as fuel in coal burning power plants and the scrap metal reprocessed. European landfills tend to have more masonry from demolished bricks, tiles and concrete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/news/view/the-case-for-pre-demolition-audits The case for pre demolition audits]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mining of municipal landfills is more complicated and has to be based on the expected content of the landfill. Older landfills, in the United States before 1994, were often capped and closed, essentially entombing the waste. This can be beneficial for waste recovery. It can also create a higher risk for [[toxic waste]] and [[leachate]] exposure as the landfill has not fully processed the stewing wastes. Mining of [[bioreactor landfill]]s and properly stabilized modern sanitary landfills provides its own benefits. The biodegradable wastes are more easily sieved out, leaving the non-biodegradable materials readily accessible. The quality of these materials for recycling and reprocessing purposes is not as high as initially recycled materials, however materials such as aluminum and steel are usually excluded from this. 
 
Landfill mining is most useful as a method to remediate hazardous landfills. Landfills that were established before [[landfill liner]] technology was well established often leak their unprocessed leachate into underlying aquifers. This is both an [[environmental hazard]] and also a legal liability. In the US, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] requires closed landfills to be monitored for at least 30 years after waste placement ceases. Mining the landfill simply to lay a safe liner is a last, but sometimes necessary resort.

== Methods ==
The parts of the mining process are the different mining machines. Depending on the complexity of the process more or fewer machines can be used. Machinery is easily transported on trucks from site to site, mounted on trailers.

An [[excavator]] or [[Loader (equipment)|front end loader]] uncovers the landfilled materials and places them on a moving floor conveyor belt to be taken to the sorting machinery. A [[trommel]] is used to separate materials by size. First, a large trommel separates materials like appliances and fabrics. A smaller trommel then allows the biodegraded soil fraction to pass through leaving non-biodegradable, recyclable materials on the screen to be collected. 

An electromagnet is used to remove the [[ferrous]] material from the waste mass as it passes along the conveyor belt.

A [[Loader (equipment)|front end loader]] is used to move sorted materials to trucks for further processing.

Odor control sprayers are wheeled tractors with a cab and movable spray arm mounted on a rotating platform. A large reservoir tank mounted behind the cab holds neutralizing agents, usually in liquid form, to reduce the smell of exposed wastes.

Depending on the level of resource recovery, material can be put through an [[air classifier]] which separates light organic material from heavy organic material. The separate streams are then loaded, by front end loaders, onto trucks either for further processing or for sale. Further manual processing can be done on site if processing facilities are too far away to justify the transportation costs.

'''Marcy South''' is a [[high voltage]] [[power line]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] that runs from [[Fraser Substation]] in Delaware County to [[Marcy Substation]] in Oneida County.  It was constructed amid heavy controversy&lt;ref name="chenangogreens"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chenangogreens.org/green_discussion/index.php?topic%3D156.0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225182301/http://chenangogreens.org/green_discussion/index.php?topic=156.0 |archivedate=2014-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1980s by the [[New York Power Authority|Power Authority of the State of New York]].

== History ==
The [[New York Power Authority|Power Authority of the State of New York]] announced plans to deliver hydroelectric power from Canada to the New York City region in 1982.

It became fully operational on June 1, 1988.

== Controversy ==
The power line met with vigorous and sometimes highly contentious and violent opposition from local property owners from its proposition to its planning and surveying, and even its construction&lt;ref name="chenangogreens"/&gt;

==Power grid improvement==
The project began in 2016 and involved the installation of three [[capacitor]] banks. The capacitor banks were installed to raise the voltage and keep it constant, which enhances transmission efficiency. Two capacitor banks were installed by [[New York Power Authority]], the other installed by [[NYSEG]] at the Fraser Substation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:MDF Sample.jpg|thumb|A sample of MDF]]
'''Medium-density fibreboard''' ('''MDF''') is an [[engineered wood]] product made by breaking down hardwood or softwood residuals into [[wood]] fibres, often in a [[defibrator]], combining it with [[wax]] and a [[resin]] binder, and forming panels by applying high [[temperature]] and [[pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;Spence, William P. (2005). ''The Home Carpenters &amp; Woodworker's Repair Manual''. [[New York City]]: Sterling. {{ISBN|1-4027-1055-0}} p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; MDF is generally denser than [[plywood]]. It is made up of separated fibres, but can be used as a building material similar in application to plywood. It is stronger and much denser than [[particle board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.decorativesurfaces.org/products/medium-density-fiberboard.html/details/ |title=Medium Density Fiberboard, Moulding, Embossing, Kitchen Cabinets – Composite Panel Association |publisher=Decorativesurfaces.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name derives from the distinction in [[density|densities]] of [[fibreboard]]. Large-scale production of MDF began in the 1980s, in both North America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations (2005). ''European forest sector outlook study: 1960/2000/2020, main report''. New York [u.a.]: United Nations. p. 32. {{ISBN|9211169216}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical properties==
Over time, the term ''MDF'' has become a generic name for any dry process [[fibre board]]. MDF is typically made up of 82% [[wood fibre]], 9% [[urea-formaldehyde]] resin glue, 8% water and 1% [[paraffin wax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/y1873e/y1873e0b.htm |author=R.

The density of the board, when evaluated in relation to the density of the fibre that goes into making the panel, is important. A thick MDF panel at a density of 700–720&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; may be considered as high density in the case of softwood fibre panels, whereas a panel of the same density made of hard wood fibres is not regarded as so. The evolution of the various types of MDF has been driven by differing need for specific applications.

==Types==
There are different kinds of MDF (sometimes labeled by colour):
* Ultralight MDF plate (ULDF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sppd.pl/en/mdf,-ldf,-hdf.html|title=MDF, LDF, HDF - www.sppd.pl||website=Sppd.pl|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Moisture resistant is typically green
* [[Fire retardant]] MDF is typically red or blue

Although similar manufacturing processes are used in making all types of fibreboard, MDF has a typical density of 600–800&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ or 0.022–0.029&amp;nbsp;lb/in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, in contrast to [[particle board]] (160–450&amp;nbsp;kg/m³) and to [[hardboard|high-density fibreboard]] (600–1,450&amp;nbsp;kg/m³).

==Manufacture==
[[File:2005mdf.PNG|thumb|right|Medium-density fibreboard output in 2005]]
In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the main species of tree used for MDF is [[plantation]]-grown [[radiata pine]]; but a variety of other products have also been used, including other woods, waste paper and fibres. Where moisture resistance is desired, a proportion of [[eucalypt]] species may be used, making use of the endemic oil content of such trees.&lt;ref name="ANU, MDF manufacture" &gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chip production ===
The trees are debarked after being cut. The bark can be sold for use in [[landscaping]], or burned in on-site [[furnaces]]. The debarked logs are sent to the MDF plant, where they go through the [[woodchipper|chipping]] process. A typical disk chipper contains 4–16 blades. Any resulting chips that are too large may be re-chipped; undersized chips may be used as fuel. The chips are then washed and checked for defects. Chips may be stored in bulk, as a reserve for manufacturing.&lt;ref name="ANU, MDF manufacture" /&gt;

=== Fibre production ===
Compared to other fibre boards, such as [[Masonite]], MDF is characterised by the next part of the process, and how the fibres are processed as individual, but intact, fibres and vessels, manufactured through a dry process.&lt;ref name="ANU, MDF manufacture" /&gt; The chips are then compacted into small plugs using a screw feeder, heated for 30–120 seconds to soften the [[lignin]] in the wood, then fed into a [[defibrator]].&lt;ref name="ANU, MDF manufacture" /&gt; A typical defibrator comprises two counter-rotating discs with grooves in their faces. Chips are fed into the centre and are fed outwards between the discs by centrifugal force. The decreasing size of the grooves gradually separates the fibres, aided by the softened lignin between them.&lt;ref name="ANU, MDF manufacture" /&gt;

From the defibrator, the pulp enters a 'blowline', a distinctive part of the MDF process. This is an expanding circular pipeline, initially 40 mm in diameter, increasing to 1500 mm. Wax is injected in the first stage, which coats the fibres and is distributed evenly by the turbulent movement of the fibres. A [[urea-formaldehyde]] resin is then injected as the main bonding agent. The wax improves moisture resistance and the resin initially helps reduce clumping. The material dries quickly in the final heated expansion chamber of the blowline and expands into a fine, fluffy and lightweight fibre. This fibre may be used immediately, or stored.&lt;ref name="ANU, MDF manufacture" /&gt;

=== Sheet forming ===
Dry fibre gets sucked into the top of a 'pendistor', which evenly distributes fibre into a uniform mat below it, usually of 230–610&amp;nbsp;mm thickness. The mat is pre-compressed and either sent straight to a continuous hot press or cut into large sheets for a multi-opening hot press. The hot press activates the bonding resin and sets the strength and density profile. The pressing cycle operates in stages, with the mat thickness being first compressed to around 1.5× the finished board thickness, then compressed further in stages and held for a short period. This gives a board profile with zones of increased density, thus mechanical strength, near the two faces of the board and a less dense core.&lt;ref name="ANU, MDF manufacture" /&gt;

After pressing, MDF is cooled in a star dryer or cooling carousel, trimmed and sanded. In certain applications, boards are also [[lamination paper|laminated]] for extra strength.

The environmental impact of MDF has greatly improved over the years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} &lt;!-- what is or was the environmental impact? --&gt; Today, many MDF boards are made from a variety of materials. These include other woods, scrap, recycled paper, bamboo, carbon fibres and polymers, forest thinnings and sawmill off-cuts.

As manufacturers are being pressured to come up with greener products, they have started testing and using non-toxic binders. New raw materials are being introduced. [[Straw]] and [[bamboo]] are becoming popular fibres because they are a fast-growing renewable resource.

==Comparison with natural woods==
MDF does not contain knots or rings, making it more uniform than [[Dimensional lumber|natural woods]] during cutting and in service.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.design-technology.org/mdf.htm |title=Medium Density Fibreboard |publisher=Design-technology.org |date= |accessdate=2014-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, MDF is not entirely [[isotropic]], since the fibres are pressed tightly together through the sheet. Typical MDF has a hard, flat, smooth surface that makes it ideal for veneering, as there is no underlying grain to telegraph through the thin veneer as with plywood. A so-called "Premium" MDF is available that features more uniform density throughout the thickness of the panel.

MDF may be glued, doweled or laminated. Typical fasteners are [[T-nut]]s and pan-head [[machine screw]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diyaudioandvideo.com/FAQ/MDF/ |title=MDF Board FAQ - Tutorial |publisher=Diyaudioandvideo.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smooth-shank nails do not hold well, and neither do fine-pitch screws, especially in the edge. Special screws are available with a coarse thread pitch, but [[sheet-metal screw]]s also work well. MDF isn't susceptible to splitting when screws are installed in the face of the material but, due to the alignment of the wood fibres, may split when screws are installed in the edge of the board without [[pilot hole]]s.

===Benefits===
* Is an excellent substrate for [[wood veneer|veneers]]
* Some varieties are less expensive than many natural woods
* Consistent in strength and size
* Shapes well
* Stable dimensions (less expansion and contraction than natural wood)
* Takes paint well
* Takes woodglue well
* High screw pull-out strength in the face grain of the material

===Drawbacks===
* Denser than [[plywood]] or [[Particle board|chipboard]] (the resins are heavy)
* Low grade MDF may swell and break when saturated with water
* May warp or expand in humid environments if not sealed
* May release [[formaldehyde]], which is a known human [[carcinogen]]&lt;ref name="International Agency for Research on Cancer, Monographs Vol 88" &gt;{{cite web

* Dulls blades more quickly than many woods. Use of tungsten carbide edged cutting tools is almost mandatory, as high speed steel dulls too quickly
* Though it does not have a grain in the plane of the board, it does have one ''into'' the board. Screwing into the edge of a board will generally cause it to split in a fashion similar to delaminating

== Applications ==
[[File:Medium density fiberboard.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Loudspeaker enclosure]] being constructed out of MDF]]
MDF is often used in school projects because of its flexibility.
[[Slatwall]] Panels made from MDF are used in the [[shop fitting]] industry.
MDF is primarily used for internal use applications due to its poor moisture resistance. it is available in raw form with fine sanded surface or with decorative overlay.

MDF is also usable for furniture such as cabinets, because of its strong surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.design-technology.org/mdf.htm|title=Medium Density Fibreboard|website=Design-technology.org|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety concerns==
When MDF is cut, a large quantity of dust particles are released into the air. It's important a [[respirator]] is worn and that the material is cut in a controlled and ventilated environment. It's good practice to seal exposed edges to limit emissions from binders contained in this material.

[[Formaldehyde]] [[resin]]s are commonly used to bind together the fibres in MDF, and testing has consistently revealed that MDF products emit [[free formaldehyde]] and other [[volatile organic compounds]] that pose health risks at concentrations considered unsafe, for at least several months after manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/pdf1986/myers86a.pdf|format=PDF|title=Effects of post-manufacture board treatments on formaldehyde emission : a literature review (1960-1984)|author=George E. Myers|website=Fpl.fs.fed.us|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1034/j.1600-0668.2002.01129.x/abstract|title=Sources of formaldehyde, other aldehydes and terpenes in a new manufactured house|first1=A.

When painting, it is a good idea to coat all sides of the finished piece in order to seal in the free formaldehyde. Wax and oil finishes may be used as finishes but they are less effective at sealing in the free formaldehyde.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Whether these constant emissions of formaldehyde reach harmful levels in real-world environments is not yet fully determined. The primary concern is for the industries using formaldehyde. As far back as 1987, the U.S. [[EPA]] classified it as a "probable human carcinogen" and, after more studies, the [[WHO]] [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC), in 1995, also classified it as a "probable human carcinogen". Further information and evaluation of all known data led the IARC to reclassify formaldehyde as a "known human carcinogen"&lt;ref name="International Agency for Research on Cancer, Monographs Vol 88"/&gt; associated with nasal sinus cancer and nasopharyngeal cancer, and possibly with leukaemia in June 2004.&lt;ref name="NCI" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/formaldehyde|title=Formaldehyde and Cancer Risk|website=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to International Composite Board Emission Standards (ICBES), there are 3 European formaldehyde classes, namely: E0, E1 and E2. This classification is based on the measurement of formaldehyde emission levels. For instance, E0 is classified as having less than 3 milligrams of formaldehyde out of every 100 grams of the glue used in particleboard and plywood fabrication. E1 and E2, conversely, are classified as having 9 and 30 grams of formaldehyde per 100 grams of glue respectively. All around the world variable certification and labeling schemes are there for such products that can be explicit to formaldehyde release, like that of Californian Air Resources Board (CARB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amrosia.com/do-you-need-to-buy-e0-e1-e2-carb-or-mdf-particleboard-and-plywood/|title=Which Particleboard and Plywood Standard Should you Use?|website=Amrosia.com|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Veneered MDF ==
Veneered MDF provides many of the advantages of MDF with a decorative [[wood veneer]] surface layer. In modern construction, spurred by the high costs of hardwoods, manufacturers have been adopting this approach to achieve a high quality finishing wrap covering over a standard MDF board. One common type uses oak veneer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skirtingboard.co.uk/pages/history-of-mdf/#Oak |title=Veneered MDF |website=Skirtingboard.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making veneered MDF is a complex procedure, which involves taking an extremely thin slice of hardwood (approx 1-2mm thick) and then through high pressure and stretching methods wrapping them around the profiled MDF boards. This is only possible with very simple profiles because otherwise when the thin wood layer has dried out, it will break at the point of bends and angles.

[[Image:Nuna3Team.JPG|thumb|300px|The team at the race course of Zandvoort]]

The '''Nuna 3''' is a [[Solar car racing|solar car]] developed by Nuon Solar Team form the [[Delft University of Technology]] in 2004-2005 for the 2005 [[World Solar Challenge]].

It succeeded the [[Nuna|Nuna2]], the solar car that scored a second consecutive win for this solar team by winning the [[World Solar Challenge]] for the third time in a row.

Nuna 3 was one of the favourites for the 2005 edition of the World Solar Challenge with a pre-race test-drive recorded top speed of 130&amp;nbsp;km/h. The final result was that the 3021 kilometers between Darwin and Adelaide were covered in a record 29 hours and 11 minutes, averaging about 103&amp;nbsp;km/h.

It has very efficient [[solar cell]]s of a type normally used to power [[artificial satellites|orbital satellites]]&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel3/4263/12206/00564003.pdf?arnumber=564003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (as had the previous Nunas), and it has better [[aerodynamics]] and is lighter than its predecessors.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

It was designed and built by 11 students from different disciplines of the Delft University of Technology, who have partly put their studies on hold for this. They used the hightech labs and workshops of the University and, as with the Nuna 2, they received advice{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} from [[Wubbo Ockels]], the first Dutch astronaut and professor at the University.

==Design criteria==

To have a good chance to win, the car has to:
*collect as much solar energy as possible
*use as little energy as possible to drive at a certain speed. This means special attention to:
**the efficiency of transferring electrical energy to the wheels, and
**minimizing friction, constituted by:
***air friction (air resistance), and
***[[rolling friction]], which in turn is affected by the weight, among other things

==Solar cells==

The solar cells are made of [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) and consist of three layers. Sunlight that penetrates the upper layer is used in the lower layers, resulting in an efficiency of over 26%. This type of solar cell is among the best available currently. Apart from efficiency, size also matters, so the entire upper surface of the Nuna 3 is covered with them, except for the cockpit.

Efficiency is optimal when the cells are hit by the solar rays perpendicularly. If not, output is reduced by roughly the [[cosine]] of the angle with the perpendicular. Because the 2005 race was held in September (as opposed to October or November in previous years) the sun was lower in the sky (it's earlier in spring). To compensate for this, as many cells as possible were placed at the sides, most notably on the wheel caps.

[[Image:VIcharacteristicSolarCell.jpg|left|[[VI characteristic]] of a solar cell]]
A solar cell gives a certain amount of [[current (electricity)|current]] for a certain amount of sunlight. The [[voltage]] depends on the [[Electrical load|load]] (more precisely the resistance of the load). The [[power (physics)|power]] is the product of voltage and current and therefore also depends on the load. Over a certain voltage the current of the solar cell quickly drops to zero, as the graph illustrates.

However, the batteries have a fairly constant voltage, which also has a rather different value than that of the solar cells. So a voltage transformation is needed. A special type of [[DC-DC converter]] is used to ensure the load resistance presented to the solar cells is such that the solar cells give maximum power, so also at the top of the green line in the graph. This is called a [[Maximum power point tracker]] (MPPT). Here too, the goal is to have this conversion achieve maximum efficiency (&gt;97%).

==Aerodynamic design==

[[Image:NunaModelWindTunnel.jpg|thumb|right|280px|The underside of the Nuna 3 model in a [[wind tunnel]]]]
The [[drag (physics)|aerodynamic drag]] is an important part of the total resistance. Important are the frontal surface and the streamline. Any deviation from the ideal streamline will cause [[turbulence]], which costs energy. The ideal streamline is achieved in various stages:
#Through computer simulations of the design
#Through testing of a [[scale model]] in a [[wind tunnel]]. For example, liquid paints can be applied to see the flow of air over the surface. The photo shows is taken during one of those tests in the Low Speed Laboratory of the TU Delft.
#Through testing of the full scale car in a wind tunnel. For this a German-Dutch wind tunnel in [[Emmeloord]] will be used.
From [[meteorology|meteorological]] data from the area where the contest is to take place, it can be concluded that there will likely be a strong side-wind. The wheel caps of the Nuna 3 are designed such that a sidewind will have a propulsory &lt;!--voorstuwend yes =ok--&gt; effect.

==Motor==

[[Image:BielMotorEfficiency.jpg|left|Efficiency of the [[Biel]] engine]]
The [[electromotor]] is totally encased in the rear wheel to minimise loss through mechanical transmission from motor to wheel (such as in a normal car in the gear box and cardan). The motor is an improved version of the original 1993 Motor of the [[Spirit of Biel III]] by the [[Engineering School of Biel]], Switzerland [http://www.ti.bfh.ch/ (now: Berner Fachhochschule Technik und Informatik)]. The improvements are due to completely redeveloped digital power electronics and control, realized 1999. They allowed for 50% more power (over 2400 W) and a 45% higher [[torque]] compared to the 1993 [[Spirit of Biel II]]. The efficiency of the total drive system (including the power electronics losses) is also improved and is now over 98%. But as the graph shows this depends somewhat on the speed and increases with speed. The design was initially made to reach its maximum performance at the normal cruising speed of the solar car at around 100&amp;nbsp;km/h.

==Test drive==

During one of the test drives in the Netherlands the Nuna 3 achieved a speed of 130&amp;nbsp;km/h. On the first day of the race the car achieved a top speed of 140&amp;nbsp;km/h. For comparison, the [[Sunraycer]] (the first winner of the Solar Challenge race) attained a top speed of 109&amp;nbsp;km/h in 1987.

==Important opponents==

The winner of the [[North American Solar Challenge]] from the [[University of Michigan Solar Car Team|University of Michigan]] (USA) was considered to be one of the most important opponents. Other important contestants were the [[MIT]] (also USA) and the Japanese [[Ashiya University]] team. In 2005 there were also two other European contestants, the Dutch [[Raedthuys Solar Team]] from the [[University of Twente]] and the Belgian [[Umicore Solar Team]] from [[Leuven]].

==2005 race monitor==

*5 August 2005: the team arrives in [[Adelaide]].
*2 September 2005: The road permit is granted.
*16 September 2005: During a test drive Nuna 3 strands in the rough next to the road. A defective wheel suspension turned out to be the cause. The damage was limited and repaired after a few days.
*22 September 2005: The Nuna 3 is approved by the organisation.
*24 September 2005: The Nuna 3 qualifies for the 8th starting position, which is better than the starting positions the previous two models got.
*25 September 2005: The Nuna 3 covered 827&amp;nbsp;km holding first place, leading the next-placed Michigan team by approximately half an hour.
*26 September 2005: On the second day the Nuna 3 covered 835&amp;nbsp;km, at an average speed of 105&amp;nbsp;km/h, which is a new single-day record for the World Solar Challenge. The Michigan team is now 132&amp;nbsp;km behind.
*27 September 2005: Nuna 3 covered 858&amp;nbsp;km, beating yesterdays record. They extended their lead to two hours. 500&amp;nbsp;km to go.
*28 September 2005: Nuna 3 arrives as first car in Adelaide, thus scoring a [[hat-trick]]. The overall average speed of 103&amp;nbsp;km/h over 3,010&amp;nbsp;km means an improvement by 6&amp;nbsp;km/h of the 2003 record.

This average speed, which could lead to maximum speeds of 140&amp;nbsp;km/h speeds on downhill section, well exceeding speed limits on the Australian highway, has led to rules changes for future races.

The '''Ontario Energy Board''' ({{lang-fr|Commission de l'énergie de l'Ontario}}) regulates [[natural gas]] and electricity utilities in the province of [[Ontario]], Canada. This includes setting rates, and licensing all participants in the electricity sector including the [[Independent Electricity System Operator]] (IESO), generators, transmitters, distributors, wholesalers and [[electricity retailer]]s, as well as natural gas marketers who sell to low volume customers.

To ensure an adequate level of consumer protection in the energy markets, the Board developed [[codes of conduct]] for gas marketers and electricity retailers, and established a complaint resolution process for energy consumers. The Board also provides a broad range of information to energy consumers about electricity and natural gas in Ontario.

The Board oversees the electricity market and ensures regulated gas and electricity monopoly utilities comply with Board decisions and orders. This includes conducting audits, performing compliance monitoring activities and monitoring various aspects of the gas and electricity utilities’ financial operating performance.

==Electricity==
In the electricity sector, the Board sets transmission and distribution rates, and approves the IESO's budget and fees. The Board also sets the regulated price of electricity for residential and small business consumers on the Regulated Price Plan. Consumers who have signed contracts with an electricity retailer will pay the price set out in their contract.
The Board licenses all electricity retailers who sell electricity to residential and small commercial consumers.

Board approval is required prior for: 
* Construction of electricity transmission lines longer than two kilometers;
* Amalgamations between an electricity distributor and another company; 
* Acquisition of significant shareholdings of an electricity transmission or distribution company — in excess of 20 per cent of the voting securities; 
* Disposal of electricity transmission and distribution assets; 
* Acquisition of electricity transmission or distribution assets by an electricity generation company or affiliate; and 
* Acquisition of electricity generation facilities by an electricity transmission or distribution company or affiliate.

The Board also monitors markets in the electricity sector and reports to the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure on the efficiency, fairness, transparency and competitiveness of the markets, and reports any abuse or potential abuse of market power. The Board may also be asked to review the IESO market rules and consider appeals of IESO orders.

==Natural Gas==
In the natural gas sector, utilities are required to submit the rates they propose to charge their customers to the Board for review. The Board approves rates associated with the cost to transport, store and distribute natural gas from utilities to consumers as well as charges to administer natural gas accounts. The Board also approves the price utilities can charge consumers for the natural gas they use. Natural gas utilities do not make a profit on the sale of natural gas. It is sold to consumers with no mark-up. Consumers who have signed contracts with a natural gas marketer will pay the price set out in their contract.

The Board licenses all natural gas marketers who sell natural gas to residential and small commercial consumers.

The Board is required to determine if constructing a natural [[gas pipeline]] is in the public interest by considering need, safety, economic feasibility, community benefits, security of supply and environmental impacts. Each municipality may grant a gas utility the right to deliver gas service and use road allowances or utility easements within its borders. The specific terms and conditions of these franchise agreements between the municipality and the utility are subject to Board approval.

The Board also reviews applications by gas distributors to create and operate underground gas storage areas and designates geological formations suitable to store natural gas in Ontario. 
Board approval is also required before a natural gas utility can sell its distribution system or amalgamate with another distributor.

There are currently two default service providers of natural gas in Ontario, [[Enbridge]] and [[Union Gas]]. These two entities are regulated by the Board.
The Board does not regulate competitive services in the natural gas sector.  These include the sale of natural gas, water heater rentals and repair or maintenance services. These products and services are competitive services and can be obtained from various companies.

[[Image:Pelletkachel.jpg|thumb|A modern pellet stove]]
A '''pellet stove''' is a [[stove]]   that burns compressed [[wood pellets|wood or biomass pellets]] to create a source of heat for residential and sometimes industrial spaces. By steadily feeding fuel from a storage container (hopper) into a burn pot area, it produces a constant flame that requires little to no physical adjustments. Today's [[central heating]] systems operated with wood pellets as a [[renewable energy]] source can reach an efficiency factor of more than 90%. &lt;!-- invented? when? where? whom? negatives? --&gt;

==Background and history==
[[image:Pelletheizung Biostar Schnittbild.jpg|thumb|Modern pellet stove cross section]]

Scrap wood and [[ship-lap]] burners have been around since at least the early 20th century easily seen in the use of barrel stoves, braziers, and oil drum fires in depression-era [[Hooverville]] historical media.  Professionally built [[wood-fired oven]]s with sawdust hoppers were used in the early part of the 20th century.  All of these units used scrap wood or sawdust. In 1930, the [[Presto-Log]] was invented reusing scrap sawdust from the Potlatch pine mill in [[Lewiston, Idaho]] for domestic heat.  From this came the miniaturized pellet stove, which emerged from Washington State in the 1980s.

The pellet stove changed in appearance over the years from a simple, boxy workhorse design, to a modern heating appliance. Pellet stoves can be either free standing units or fireplace inserts vented into an existing chimney. Most pellet stoves are constructed using large, heat conductive, steel or [[cast-iron]] pieces, with stainless steel to encase circuitry and exhaust areas.

Pellet furnaces and [[pellet boiler]]s are also available in addition to the decorative stove. These units can be retrofitted into existing home heating systems with only minor changes to existing ductwork and or plumbing.

The heating industry has considerably shifted toward [[biomass]] stoves and heating devices based on efficient combustible and renewable resources.{{cn|date=December 2014}}  This was a trend that began with the [[1973 oil crisis]] causing the creation of the first pellet stoves.  Even so, pellet stoves have become a viable, economical, and popular option for home heating systems only in the last ten years.{{cn|date=December 2014}}   Between 1998 and 2010, 824,410 pellet stoves and fireplace inserts were made in the U.S..&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | title=Hearth Industry Unit Shipments | url=http://pelletheat.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Hearth20Shipments202010.pdf | publisher=pelletheat.org | accessdate=3 March 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111012191045/http://pelletheat.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Hearth20Shipments202010.pdf | archivedate=12 October 2011 | df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

While some stoves are [[Underwriters Laboratories|UL listed]] for fuels other than pellets, such as wheat, corn, sunflower seeds, and cherry pits, many pellet stove manufacturers recommend the use of a corn and pellet mixture.

== Method ==
The [[pellet fuel]] is delivered from the storage facility or the day tank (single stoves) into the combustion chamber.  With the heat generated, circuit water is heated in the pellet boiler.  In central heating systems the hot water then runs through the heating circuit.  The heat distribution is the same as other central heating systems. Unlike oil or gas heating, the inclusion of a hot water reservoir is recommended with pellet heating systems to save hot water until it is needed.{{cn|date=December 2014}}

== Benefits ==
[[image:Pellet Heating.jpg|thumb|Pellet burning central heating system in basement of family home]]
Most pellet stoves are self igniting and cycle themselves on and off under thermostatic control.  Stoves with automatic ignition can be equipped with remote controls.  Recent innovations include integrated microcontroller monitoring of various safety conditions and can run diagnostic tests if an imminent problem arises.

A properly cleaned and maintained pellet stove should not create [[creosote]], the sticky, flammable substance that causes [[chimney fire]]s.  Pellets burn very cleanly and create only a layer of fine [[fly ash]] as a byproduct of combustion.  The grade of pellet fuel affects the performance and ash output.  Premium grade pellets produce less than one percent ash content, while standard or low grade pellets produce up to six percent ash.&lt;ref name=pfi&gt;{{cite web|title=PFI Standards Program|url=http://www.pelletheat.org/pfi-standards-program|publisher=Pellet Fuels Institute|accessdate=21 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pellet stove users should be aware of the extra maintenance required with a lower grade pellet, and that inconsistent wood quality can cause serious effects to the electronic machinery over a short period of time.

A pellet stove is normally associated with pelletized wood.  However, many pellet stoves will also burn fuels such as grain, corn, seeds, or [[woodchips]].  In some pellet stoves, these fuels may need to be mixed with wood pellets.  Pelletized trash (containing mostly waste paper) is also a fuel for pellet stoves.

Unlike wood stoves which operate exclusively on a principle of [[chimney]] draft, a pellet stove must use specially sealed exhaust pipe to prevent exhaust gases escaping into the living space due to the air pressure produced by a combustion blower.  Pellet stoves require certified double walled venting, normally three or four inches in diameter with a stainless steel interior and galvanized exterior.  Because pellet stoves have a forced exhaust system, they have the advantage of not always requiring a vertical rise to vent, although a {{convert|3|to|5|ft|m|adj=on}} vertical run to induce some draft is recommended to prevent leakage in the case of a power outage.  Like a modern gas appliance, pellet stoves can be vented horizontally through an outside wall and terminated below the roof line, making it an excellent choice for structures without an existing chimney.  If an existing chimney is available, manufacturers urge use of a correctly sized stainless steel liner the length of the chimney for proper drafting.  Modern building techniques have created tightly sealed homes, forcing many pellet stove manufacturers to recommend their stoves be installed with outside air intake to ensure the stoves will run efficiently and prevent potential negative pressure within the home.

Pellet stoves are approved for use in mobile homes, while standard wood burning stoves are not.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In many states{{where|date=December 2017}} pellet fuel is exempt from sales tax. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/memos/sales/m07_3s.pdf Retrieved 2016-08-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tax credit ==

Until January 1, 2012, in most states in the U.S., a 75% efficient pellet stove was eligible for a tax credit up to 30% of the cost of the appliance as part of the [[25C provision]], plus labor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hihut.com/2009-wood-stove-tax-credits-you-should-be-taking-advantage-of.html 2009 Wood Stove Tax Credits You Should Be Taking Advantage Of]. Retrieved 2009-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forgreenheat.org/incentives/federal.html The Alliance for Green Heat - Federal Tax Incentives for Wood and Pellet Stoves - Carbon Neutral, Sustainable, Local and Affordable Heating&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles of operation ==
[[Image:Pellet Stove burn pot.jpg|thumb|right|A pellet stove burn pot]]
A pellet stove normally consists of these components, whether basic or complex:

* A hopper
* An [[screw conveyor|auger]] system
* Two blower fans: [[combustion]] and [[convection]]
* A firebox:  burn pot and ash collection system, sometimes lined with ceramic fiber panels
* Various safety features (vacuum switch, heat sensors)
* A controller

To properly function, a pellet stove uses electricity and can be connected to a standard electrical outlet. A pellet stove, like an automatic coal stoker, is a consistent heater consuming fuel that is fed evenly from a refillable hopper into the burn pot (a perforated cast-iron or steel basin), through a motorized system. The most commonly used distributor is an auger system that consists of a spiral length of metal encased in a tube. This mechanism is either located above the burn pot or slightly beneath and guides a portion of pellet fuel from the hopper upwards until it falls into the burn pot for combustion.

Fan systems are necessary for clean, economical performance.  The flame produced is concentrated and intense in the small area of the burn pot as a combustion blower introduces air into the bottom of the burn pot, while also forcing exhaust gases into the chimney.  While some pellet stoves will be hot to the touch (especially on the viewing window), most manufacturers utilize a series of cast-iron or steel heat exchangers that run along the back and top areas of the visible firebox.  With a convection blower, room air is circulated through the heat exchangers and directed into the living space.  This method allows for a much higher efficiency than the radiant heat of a hand-fed wood or coal stove, and will in most cases cause the top, sides, and back of the stove to be at most warm to the touch.  Along with convection air, an exhaust fan forces air from the firebox through special venting specifically made for pellet fuel. This cycle of circulation is an integral part of the combustion system as well, for the concentrated high temperature flame will quickly overheat the firebox.  The possible problems associated with overheating are electrical component failure and flames traveling into the auger tube causing a hopper fire.  As safeguards, all pellet stoves are equipped with heat sensors, and sometimes vacuum sensors, enabling the controller to shut down if an unsafe condition is detected.  For daily maintenance, an ash vacuum is recommended. These are similar to shop vacs, but are designed for the removal of ash materials. These vacuums are available with a pellet stove kit which enables the cleaning of the interior areas of the stove which improves efficiency.

Pellet stoves can either be lit manually or through an automatic igniter.  The igniter piece resembles a car's [[cigarette lighter receptacle#Lighter|electric cigarette lighter]] heating coil.  Most models have automatic ignition and can be readily equipped with thermostats or remote controls.

===Corn stove===

A '''corn stove''' is designed for whole kernel shelled [[corn kernel]] combustion and is similar to a pellet stove. The chief difference between a pellet stove and a dedicated corn stove is the addition of metal stirring rod within the burnpot or an active ash removal system.  These vary in design slightly, but usually consist of one long metal stalk with smaller rods welded at a perpendicular angle, in order to churn the burn pot as it spins. An active ash removal system consists of augers at the bottom of the burn pot that evacuate the ash and clinkers. During a normal burn cycle, the sugar content within corn (and other similar bio-fuels) will cause the ashes to stick together, forming a hard mass.  The metal stirring rod breaks apart these masses, causing a much more consistent burn.  While there is demand to create stoves that are able to burn multiple fuels with minimal adjustments, some pellet stoves are not designed to stir fuel and cannot burn corn fuel.

[[Electrolysis of water|Electrolysis]] is an important technology for the [[production of hydrogen]] to be used as an energy carrier.

With fast dynamic response times, large operational ranges, and high efficiencies, water electrolysis is a promising technology for energy storage coupled with renewable energy sources.

__TOC__

==History==
The use of a PEM for electrolysis was first introduced in the 1960s by General Electric, developed to overcome the drawbacks to the alkaline electrolysis technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russell|first=JH|author2=Nuttall LJ |author3=Ficket AP |title=Hydrogen generation by solid polymer electrolyte water electrolysis.|journal=American Chemical Scociety Division of Fuel Chemistry Preprints|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial performances yielded 1.88 V at 1.0 A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which was, compared to the [[alkaline electrolysis]] technology of that time, very efficient. In the late 1970s the alkaline electrolyzers were reporting performances around 2.06 V at 0.215 A/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=LeRoy|first=RL|author2=Janjua MB |author3=Renaud R |author4=Leuenberger U |title=Analysis of Time-Variation Effects in Water Electrolyzers.|journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus prompting a sudden interest in the late 1970s and early 1980s in polymer electrolytes for water electrolysis.

A thorough review of the historical performance from the early research to that of today can be found in chronological order with many of the operating conditions in the 2013 review by Carmo et al.&lt;ref name="carmo2013a" /&gt;

==Advantages of PEM electrolysis==
One of the largest advantages to PEM electrolysis is its ability to operate at high current densities.&lt;ref name="carmo2013a" /&gt; This can result in reduced operational costs, especially for systems coupled with very dynamic energy sources such as wind and solar, where sudden spikes in energy input would otherwise result in uncaptured energy. The polymer electrolyte allows the PEM electrolyzer to operate with a very thin membrane (~100-200 μm) while still allowing high pressures, resulting in low ohmic losses, primarily caused by the conduction of protons across the membrane (0.1 S/cm) and a [[compressed hydrogen]] output.&lt;ref name="slade2002a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Slade|first=S|author2=Campbell SA |author3=Ralph TR |author4=Walsh FC |title=Ionic conductivity of an extruded Nafion 1100 EW series of membranes|journal=Journal of the Electrochemical Society|year=2002|doi=10.1149/1.1517281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The polymer electrolyte membrane, due to its solid structure, exhibits a low gas crossover rate resulting in very high product gas purity.&lt;ref name="carmo2013a" /&gt; Maintaining a high gas purity is important for storage safety and for the direct usage in a fuel cell. The safety limits for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are at standard conditions 4&amp;nbsp;mol-% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=schroeder2004a&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schröder|first=V|author2=Emonts B |author3=Janßen H |author4=Schulze HP |title=Explosion Limits of Hydrogen/Oxygen Mixtures at Initial Pressures up to 200 bar.|journal=Chem. Eng. Technol.|year=2004|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science==
An electrolyzer is an electrochemical device to convert electricity and water into hydrogen and oxygen, these gases can then be used as a means to store energy for later use. This use can range from electrical grid stabilization from dynamic electrical sources such as wind turbines and solar cells to localized [[hydrogen production]] as a fuel for [[fuel cell vehicles]]. The PEM electrolyzer utilizes a [[proton exchange membrane|solid polymer electrolyte (SPE)]] to conduct protons from the anode to the cathode while insulating the electrodes electrically. Under [[standard conditions]] the [[standard enthalpy of formation|enthalpy]] required for the formation of water is 285.9 kJ/mol. A portion of the required energy for a sustained electrolysis reaction is supplied by thermal energy and the remainder is supplied through electrical energy.&lt;ref name="mergel2013a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mergel|first=J |author2=Carmo M |author3=Fritz, D|editor-last=Stolten|editor-first=D|title=Transition to Renewable Energy Systems|chapter=Status on Technologies for Hydrogen Production by Water Electrolysis|publisher=Wiley-VCH|location=Weinheim|year=2013|isbn=978-3-527-33239-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===
The actual value for open circuit voltage of an operating electrolyzer will lie between the 1.23 V and 1.48 V depending how the cell/stack design utilizes the thermal energy inputs. This is however quite difficult to determine or measure because an operating electrolyzer also experiences other voltage losses from internal [[electrical resistance]]s, proton conductivity, mass transport through the cell and catalyst utilization to name a few.

====Anode reaction====
The half reaction taking place on the anode side of a PEM electrolyzer is commonly referred to as the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER). Here the liquid water reactant is supplied to catalyst where the supplied water is oxidized to oxygen, protons and electrons.

:{| style="border:1px solid #ccc;"
|-
||
&lt;chem&gt;
2 H2O (l) -&gt; O2 (g) + 4H+ (aq) + 4 e^-
&lt;/chem&gt;
|}

====Cathode reaction====
The half reaction taking place on the cathode side of a PEM electrolyzer is commonly referred to as the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER). Here the supplied electrons and the protons that have conducted through the membrane are combined to create gaseous hydrogen.

:{| style="border:1px solid #ccc;"
|-
|| &lt;chem&gt;
4H+ (aq) + 4 e^- -&gt; 2H2 (g)
&lt;/chem&gt;
|}

The illustration below depicts a simplification of how PEM electrolysis works, showing the individual half-reactions together along with the complete reaction of a PEM electrolyzer. In this case the electrolyzer is coupled with a solar panel for the [[hydrogen production|production of hydrogen]], however the solar panel could be replaced with any source of electricity.

[[File:PEM Elektrolyse 5.gif|thumb|align=center|Diagram of PEM electrolyzer cell and the basic principles of operation.]]

===Second law of thermodynamics===
As per the [[second law of thermodynamics]] the [[enthalpy]] of the reaction is:

:{| style="border:1px solid #ccc;"
|-
|| &lt;math&gt;
\Delta H = \underbrace{\Delta G}_{\textrm{elec.}} + \underbrace{T\Delta S}_{\textrm{heat}}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Where &lt;math&gt;\Delta G &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gibbs free energy]] of the reaction, &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature of the reaction and &lt;math&gt;\Delta S&lt;/math&gt; is the change in [[entropy]] of the system.

:{| style="border:1px solid #ccc;"
|-
|| &lt;chem&gt;
H2O (l) + \Delta H -&gt; H2 + 1/2 O2
&lt;/chem&gt;
|}

The overall cell reaction with thermodynamic energy inputs then becomes:

:{| style="border:1px solid #ccc;"
|-
|| &lt;chem&gt;
H2O (l) -&gt;[+\overbrace{237.2 \ \ce{kJ / mol}}^{\ce{electricity}}][+\underbrace{48.6 \ \ce{kJ / mol}}_{\ce{heat}}] {H2} + 1/2 O2
&lt;/chem&gt;
|}

The thermal and electrical inputs shown above represent the minimum amount of energy that can be supplied by electricity in order to obtain an electrolysis reaction. Assuming that the maximum amount of heat energy (48.6 kJ/mol) is supplied to the reaction, the reversible cell voltage &lt;math&gt;V^0_{\textrm{rev}}&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated.

===Open circuit voltage (OCV)===
{| style="border:1px solid #ccc;"

The calculation of cell voltage assuming no irreversibilities exist and all of the thermal energy is utilized by the reaction is referred to as the lower heating value (LHV). The alternative formulation, using the higher heating value (HHV) is calculated assuming that all of the energy to drive the electrolysis reaction is supplied by the electrical component of the required energy which results in a higher reversible cell voltage. When using the HHV the voltage calculation is referred to as the thermoneutral voltage.

===Voltage losses===
The performance of electrolysis cells, like [[fuel cells]], are typically compared by plotting their polarization curves, which is obtained by plotting the cell voltage against the current density. The primary sources of increased voltage in a PEM electrolyzer (the same also applies for [[PEM fuel cell]]s) can be categorized into thee main areas, [[Ohmic loss]]es, [[overpotential|activation losses]] and mass transport losses. Due to the reversal of operation between a PEM fuel cell and a PEM electrolyzer, the degree of impact for these various losses is different between the two processes.&lt;ref name="carmo2013a" /&gt;

:{| style="border:1px solid #ccc;"
|-
|| &lt;math&gt;
V_{\textrm{cell}}=E+V_{\textrm{act}} +V_{\textrm{trans}} +V_{\textrm{ohm}}
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The performance of a PEM electrolysis system is typically compared by plotting the overpotential versus the cells [[current density]]. This essentially results in a curve that represents the power per square centimeter of cell area required to produce [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. Conversely to the [[PEM fuel cell]], the better the PEM electrolyzer the lower the [[electrode potential|cell voltage]] at a given [[current density]]. The figure below is the result of a simulation from the [[Forschungszentrum Jülich]] of a 25&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; single cell PEM electrolyzer under thermoneutral operation depicting the primary sources of voltage loss and their contributions for a range of [[current density|current densities]].

[[File:PEM electrolysis loss breakdown.pdf|thumb|upright=3|Polarization curve depicting the various losses attributed to PEM electrolysis cell operation.]]

====Ohmic losses====
Ohmic losses are an electrical overpotential introduced to the electrolysis process by the internal resistance of the cell components. This loss then requires an additional voltage to maintain the [[electrolysis]] reaction, the prediction of this loss follows [[ohms law|Ohm's law]] and holds a linear relationship to the [[current density]] of the operating electrolyzer.

:{| style="border:1px solid #ccc;"
|-
|| &lt;math&gt;
V=I\cdot R
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The energy loss due to the electrical resistance is not entirely lost. The voltage drop due to resistivity is associated with the conversion the electrical energy to heat energy through a process known as [[Joule heating]]. Much of this heat energy is carried away with the reactant water supply and lost to the environment, however a small portion of this energy is then recaptured as heat energy in the electrolysis process. The amount of heat energy that can be recaptured is dependent on many aspects of system operation and cell design.

:{| style="border:1px solid #ccc;"
|-
|| &lt;math&gt;
Q\propto I^2 \cdot R
&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The Ohmic losses due to the conduction of protons contribute to the loss of efficiency which also follows [[ohms law|Ohm's law]], however without the [[Joule heating]] effect. The proton conductivity of the [[proton exchange membrane|PEM]] is very dependent on the hydration, temperature, heat treatment, and ionic state of the membrane.&lt;ref name="schalenbach2013a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schalenbach|first=M|author2=Carmo M |author3=Fritz DL |author4=Mergel J |author5=Stolten D |title=Pressurized PEM water electrolysis: Efficiency and gas crossover|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.09.013|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.09.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faradaic losses and crossover===
Faradaic losses describe the efficiency losses that are correlated to the current, that is supplied without leading to hydrogen at the cathodic gas outlet. The produced hydrogen and oxygen can permeate across the membrane, referred to as crossover.&lt;ref name="schalenbach2013a" /&gt; Mixtures of both gases at the electrodes result. At the cathode, oxygen can be catalytically reacted with hydrogen on the platinum surface of the cathodic catalyst. At the anode, hydrogen and oxygen do not react at the iridium oxide catalyst.&lt;ref name="schalenbach2013a" /&gt; Thus, safety hazards due to explosive anodic mixtures hydrogen in oxygen can result. The supplied energy for the hydrogen production is lost, when hydrogen is lost due to the reaction with oxygen at the cathode and permeation from the cathode across the membrane to the anode corresponds. Hence, the ratio of the amount of lost and produced hydrogen determines the faradaic losses. At pressurized operation of the electrolyzer the crossover and the correlated faradaic efficiency losses increase.&lt;ref name="schalenbach2013a" /&gt;

===Hydrogen compression during water electrolysis===
Hydrogen evolution due to pressurized electrolysis is comparable to an isothermal compression process, which is in terms of efficiency preferable compared to mechanical isotropical compression.&lt;ref name="schalenbach2013a" /&gt; However, the contributions of the afore mentioned faradaic losses increase with operating pressures. Thus, in order to produce compressed hydrogen, the in-situ compression during electrolysis and subsequent compression of the gas have to be pondered under efficiency considerations.

==PEM electrolysis system operation==
[[File:PEM high pressure electrolyser.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|PEM high pressure electrolyzer system]]
The ability of the PEM electrolyzer to operate, not only under highly dynamic conditions, but also in part-load and overload conditions is one of the reasons for the recently renewed interest in this technology. The demands of an electrical grid are relatively stable and predictable, however when coupling these to energy sources such as wind and solar, the demand of the grid rarely matches the generation of the renewable energy. This means energy produced from renewable sources such as wind and solar must have a buffer, or a means of storing off-peak energy.

===PEM Efficiency===
When determining the electrical efficiency of PEM electrolysis, the higher heat value (HHV) can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kruse|first1=Bjørnar|title=Hydrogen Status og muligheter|url=http://network.bellona.org/content/uploads/sites/3/Hydrogen_6-2002.pdf|website=http://bellona.org/|publisher=Bellona Norway|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the catalyst layer interacts with water as steam. As the process operates at 80&amp;nbsp;°C for PEM electrolysers the waste heat can be redirected through the system to create the steam, resulting in a higher overall electrical efficiency. The lower heat value (LHV) must be used for alkaline electrolysers as the process within these electrolysers requires water in liquid form and uses alkalinity to facilitate the breaking of the bond holding the hydrogen and oxygen atoms together. The lower heat value must also be used for fuel cells, as steam is the output rather than input.

PEM electrolysis has an electrical efficiency of about 80% in working application, in terms of hydrogen produced per unit of electricity used to drive the reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ITM - Hydrogen Refuelling Infrastructure - February 2017|url=http://www.level-network.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ITM-Power.pdf|website=http://www.level-network.com|accessdate=17 April 2018|ref=pg12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency of PEM electrolysis is expected to reach 82-86%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost reduction and performance increase of PEM electrolysers|url=http://www.fch.europa.eu/sites/default/files/Nov22_Session3_Panel%205_Slot%202_NOVEL-MEGASTACK_Thomassen%20%28ID%202891376%29.pdf|website=http://www.fch.europa.eu|publisher=Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking|accessdate=17 April 2018|ref=pg9}}&lt;/ref&gt; before 2030, while also maintaining durability as progress in this area continues at a pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report and Financial Statements 30 April 2016|url=http://www.itm-power.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ITM-Annual-Report-2016.pdf|website=http://www.itm-power.com|accessdate=17 April 2018|ref=pg27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[aerospace engineering]], the '''propellant mass fraction''' is the portion of a vehicle's mass which does not reach the destination, usually used as a measure of the vehicle's performance. In other words, the '''propellant mass fraction''' is the ratio between the propellant mass and the initial mass of the vehicle. In a spacecraft, the destination is usually an orbit, while for aircraft it is their landing location. A higher mass fraction represents less weight in a design.  Another related measure is the [[payload fraction]], which is the fraction of initial weight that is payload.It can be applied to a vehicle, a stage of a Vehicle or to a Rocket Propulsion System

==Formulation==
The propellant mass fraction is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta = \frac{m_p}{m_0}&lt;/math&gt;

And because,
:&lt;math&gt;m_0 = m_f + m_p&lt;/math&gt;

it follows that:
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta = \frac{m_0 - m_f}{m_0} = \frac{m_p}{m_p + m_f} = 1 - \frac{m_f}{m_0}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is the propellant mass fraction
:&lt;math&gt;m_p&lt;/math&gt; is the propellant mass
:&lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial mass of the vehicle
:&lt;math&gt;m_f&lt;/math&gt; is the final mass of the vehicle

==Significance==

In [[rocket]]s for a given target [[orbit]], a rocket's mass fraction is the portion of the rocket's pre-launch mass (fully fueled) that does not reach orbit.  The propellant mass fraction is the ratio of just the propellant to the entire mass of the vehicle at takeoff (propellant plus dry mass).  In the cases of a [[single stage to orbit]] (SSTO) vehicle or suborbital vehicle, the mass fraction equals the propellant mass fraction; simply the fuel mass divided by the mass of the full spaceship. A rocket employing [[multistage rocket|staging]], which are the only designs to have reached orbit, has a mass fraction higher than the propellant mass fraction because parts of the rocket itself are dropped off en route.  Propellant mass fractions are typically around 0.8 to 0.9.

In aircraft, mass fraction is related to range, an aircraft with a higher mass fraction can go farther. Aircraft mass fractions are typically around 0.5.

When applied to a rocket as a whole, a low mass fraction is desirable, since it indicates a greater capability for the rocket to deliver payload to orbit for a given amount of fuel.  Conversely, when applied to a single stage, where the propellant mass fraction calculation doesn't include the payload, a higher propellant mass fraction corresponds to a more efficient design, since there is less non-propellant mass.  Without the benefit of staging, SSTO designs are typically designed for mass fractions around 0.9. Staging increases the [[payload fraction]], which is one of the reasons SSTO's appear difficult to build.

For example, the complete [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle system]] has:&lt;ref&gt;[http://psas.pdx.edu/news/2000-11-02/sld012/ Typical propellant mass fractions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918054100/http://psas.pdx.edu/news/2000-11-02/sld012/ |date=2010-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*fueled weight at liftoff:  1,708,500&amp;nbsp;kg
*dry weight at liftoff: 342,100&amp;nbsp;kg

Given these numbers, the propellant mass fraction is &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 1-(342,100/1,708,500) = 0.7998&lt;/math&gt;.

The mass fraction plays an important role in the [[rocket equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \Delta v = -v_e \ln\frac{m_f}{m_0}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m_f/m_0&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of final mass to initial mass (i.e., one minus the mass fraction), &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \Delta v&lt;/math&gt; is the change in the vehicle's velocity as a result of the fuel burn and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle v_e&lt;/math&gt; is the effective exhaust velocity (see below).

The term [[specific impulse|effective exhaust velocity]] is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle v_e = g_n I_{sp}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''I''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; is the fuel's specific impulse in seconds and ''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''standard acceleration of gravity'' (note that this is not the local acceleration of gravity).

To make a powered landing from orbit on a celestial body without an atmosphere requires the same mass reduction as reaching orbit from its surface, if the speed at which the surface is reached is zero.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10466">'''Rayleigh flow''' refers to frictionless, non-[[Adiabatic]] flow through a constant area duct where the effect of heat addition or rejection is considered.  [[Compressible flow|Compressibility]] effects often come into consideration, although the Rayleigh flow model certainly also applies to [[incompressible flow]].  For this model, the duct area remains constant and no mass is added within the duct.  Therefore, unlike [[Fanno flow]], the [[stagnation temperature]] is a variable.  The heat addition causes a decrease in [[stagnation pressure]], which is known as the Rayleigh effect and is critical in the design of combustion systems.  Heat addition will cause both [[supersonic]] and [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] [[Mach number]]s to approach Mach 1, resulting in [[choked flow]].  Conversely, heat rejection decreases a subsonic Mach number and increases a supersonic Mach number along the duct.  It can be shown that for calorically perfect flows the maximum [[entropy]] occurs at [[Mach number|M]] = 1.  Rayleigh flow is named after [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh]].

==Theory==
[[File:Rayleigh Line.PNG|thumb|500px|'''Figure 1''' A Rayleigh Line is plotted on the dimensionless H-ΔS axis.]]
The Rayleigh flow model begins with a [[differential equation]] that relates the change in Mach number with the change in [[stagnation temperature]], T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  The differential equation is shown below.

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{dM^2}{M^2} = \frac{1 + \gamma M^2}{1 - M^2}\left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2\right)\frac{dT_0}{T_0} &lt;/math&gt;

Solving the differential equation leads to the relation shown below, where T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;* is the stagnation temperature at the throat location of the duct which is required for thermally choking the flow.

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{T_0}{T_0^*} = \frac{2\left(\gamma + 1\right)M^2}{\left(1 + \gamma M^2\right)^2}\left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2\right) &lt;/math&gt;

These values are significant in the design of combustion systems.  For example, if a turbojet combustion chamber has a maximum temperature of T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;* = 2000 K, T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and M at the entrance to the combustion chamber must be selected so thermal choking does not occur, which will limit the mass flow rate of air into the engine and decrease thrust.

For the Rayleigh flow model, the dimensionless change in entropy relation is shown below.

:&lt;math&gt;\ \Delta S = \frac{\Delta s}{c_p} = ln\left[M^2\left(\frac{\gamma + 1}{1 + \gamma M^2}\right)^\frac{\gamma + 1}{\gamma}\right] &lt;/math&gt;

The above equation can be used to plot the Rayleigh line on a Mach number versus ΔS graph, but the dimensionless enthalpy, H, versus ΔS diagram is more often used.  The dimensionless enthalpy equation is shown below with an equation relating the [[static temperature]] with its value at the choke location for a calorically perfect gas where the [[Specific heat capacity|heat capacity]] at constant pressure, c&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, remains constant.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H &amp;= \frac{h}{h^*} = \frac{c_pT}{c_pT^*} = \frac{T}{T^*} \\
\frac{T}{T^*} &amp;= \left[\frac{\left(\gamma + 1\right)M}{1 + \gamma M^2}\right]^2
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

The above equation can be manipulated to solve for M as a function of H. However, due to the form of the T/T* equation, a complicated multi-root relation is formed for M = M(T/T*). Instead, M can be chosen as an independent variable where ΔS and H can be matched up in a chart as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 shows that heating will increase an upstream, [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] Mach number until M = 1.0 and the flow [[Choked flow|chokes]].  Conversely, adding heat to a duct with an upstream, [[supersonic]] Mach number will cause the Mach number to decrease until the flow chokes.  Cooling produces the opposite result for each of those two cases. The Rayleigh flow model reaches maximum entropy at M = 1.0 For subsonic flow, the maximum value of H occurs at M = 0.845.  This indicates that cooling, instead of heating, causes the Mach number to move from 0.845 to 1.0  This is not necessarily correct as the stagnation temperature always increases to move the flow from a subsonic Mach number to M = 1, but from M = 0.845 to M = 1.0 the flow accelerates faster than heat is added to it. Therefore, this is a situation where heat is added but T/T* decreases in that region.

==Additional Rayleigh Flow Relations==
The area and mass flow rate are held constant for Rayleigh flow.  Unlike Fanno flow, the [[Fanning friction factor]], ''f'', remains constant.  These relations are shown below with the * symbol representing the throat location where choking can occur.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A &amp;= A^* = \mbox{constant} \\
\dot{m} &amp;= \dot{m}^* = \mbox{constant} \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Differential equations can also be developed and solved to describe Rayleigh flow property ratios with respect to the values at the choking location.  The ratios for the pressure, density, static temperature, velocity and stagnation pressure are shown below, respectively.  They are represented graphically along with the stagnation temperature ratio equation from the previous section.  A stagnation property contains a '0' subscript.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{p}{p^*} &amp;= \frac{\gamma + 1}{1 + \gamma M^2} \\
\frac{\rho}{\rho^*} &amp;= \frac{1 + \gamma M^2}{\left(\gamma + 1\right)M^2} \\
\frac{T}{T^*} &amp;= \frac{\left(\gamma + 1\right)^2M^2}{\left(1 + \gamma M^2\right)^2} \\
\frac{v}{v^*} &amp;= \frac{\left(\gamma + 1\right)M^2}{1 + \gamma M^2} \\
\frac{p_0}{p_0^*} &amp;= \frac{\gamma + 1}{1 + \gamma M^2}\left[\left(\frac{2}{\gamma + 1}\right)\left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2\right)\right]^\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Fanno-Rayleigh confrontation graph.png|thumb|500px|'''Figure 3''' Fanno and Rayleigh Line Intersection Chart.]]
The Rayleigh flow model has many analytical uses, most notably involving aircraft engines.  For instance, the combustion chambers inside turbojet engines usually have a constant area and the fuel mass addition is negligible.  These properties make the Rayleigh flow model applicable for heat addition to the flow through combustion, assuming the heat addition does not result in [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] of the air-fuel mixture.  Producing a shock wave inside the combustion chamber of an engine due to thermal choking is very undesirable due to the decrease in mass flow rate and thrust.  Therefore, the Rayleigh flow model is critical for an initial design of the duct geometry and combustion temperature for an engine.

The Rayleigh flow model is also used extensively with the [[Fanno flow]] model.  These two models intersect at points on the enthalpy-entropy and Mach number-entropy diagrams, which is meaningful for many applications. However, the entropy values for each model are not equal at the sonic state. The change in entropy is 0 at M = 1 for each model, but the previous statement means the change in entropy from the same arbitrary point to the sonic point is different for the Fanno and Rayleigh flow models. If initial values of s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are defined, a new equation for dimensionless entropy versus Mach number can be defined for each model. These equations are shown below for Fanno and Rayleigh flow, respectively.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Delta S_F &amp;= \frac{s - s_i}{c_p} = ln\left[\left(\frac{M}{M_i}\right)^\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}\left(\frac{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M_i^2}{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2}\right)^\frac{\gamma + 1}{2\gamma}\right] \\
\Delta S_R &amp;= \frac{s - s_i}{c_p} = ln\left[\left(\frac{M}{M_i}\right)^2\left(\frac{1 + \gamma M_i^2}{1 + \gamma M^2}\right)^\frac{\gamma + 1}{\gamma}\right]
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Figure 3 shows the Rayleigh and Fanno lines intersecting with each other for initial conditions of s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and M&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.0  The intersection points are calculated by equating the new dimensionless entropy equations with each other, resulting in the relation below.

:&lt;math&gt;\ \left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M_i^2\right)\left[\frac{M_i^2}{\left(1 + \gamma M_i^2\right)^2}\right] = \left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^2\right)\left[\frac{M^2}{\left(1 + \gamma M^2\right)^2}\right] &lt;/math&gt;

The intersection points occur at the given initial Mach number and its post-[[normal shock]] value. For Figure 3, these values are M = 3.0 and 0.4752, which can be found the normal shock tables listed in most compressible flow textbooks. A given flow with a constant duct area can switch between the Rayleigh and Fanno models at these points.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7900">'''Reinforced thermoplastic pipe''' ('''RTP''') is a generic term referring to a reliable high strength synthetic fibre (such as glass, aramid or carbon), initially developed in the early 1990s by Wavin Repox, [[Akzo Nobel]] and by Tubes d'Aquitaine from France, who developed the first pipes reinforced with synthetic fibre to replace medium pressure steel pipes in response to growing demand for non-corrosive conduits for application in the onshore oil and gas industry, particularly in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.materials-careers.org.uk/careers/tubes.htm Tubes d'Aquitaine - Inventor of RTPs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905223944/http://www.materials-careers.org.uk/careers/tubes.htm |date=2008-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;
Typically, the materials used in the construction of the pipe might be [[Polyethylene]] (PE), [[Polyamide]]-11 or [[PVDF]] and may be reinforced with [[Aramid]] or [[Polyester]] fibre although other combinations are used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.automateddynamics.com/docs/thermoplastic_composites.pdf Different materials for RTP - CEAC Automated Dynamics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006171921/http://www.automateddynamics.com/docs/thermoplastic_composites.pdf |date=2007-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
More recently the technology of producing such pipe, including the marketing, rests with a few key companies, one of which is [[Pipelife]] with [[Soluforce]] where it is available in coils up to {{convert|400|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} length. These pipes are available in pressure ratings from {{convert|30|to|90|bar|MPa psi|0|abbr=on}}. Over the last few years this type of pipe has been acknowledged as a standard alternative solution to steel for oilfield flowline applications by certain oil companies and operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Bert Dalmolen| title= Reinforced thermoplastic pipe: standardised composite solution for oilfield flowlines| journal= Petromin| year= 2006| volume= | issue= October| pages=30–37| url= http://www.petromin.safan.com/mag/poct06/t30.pdf| format=  &amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3A+intitle%3AReinforced+thermoplastic+pipe%3A+standardised+composite+solution+for+oilfield+flowlines&amp;as_publication=Petromin&amp;as_ylo=2006&amp;as_yhi=2006&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008112330/http://www.petromin.safan.com/mag/poct06/t30.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great advantage of this pipe is also its very fast installation time compared to steel pipe when considering the welding time as average speeds up to {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}/day have been reached installing RTP in ground surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Soluforce| title= Soluforce lays Sumatra pipeline in a jiffy| journal= PetroMin| year= 2006| volume= | issue= December| pages=32–34| url= http://www.petromin.safan.com/mag/pdec06/t32.pdf| format=  &amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3A+intitle%3ASoluforce+lays+Sumatra+pipeline+in+a+jiffy&amp;as_publication=PetroMin&amp;as_ylo=2006&amp;as_yhi=2006&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008112344/http://www.petromin.safan.com/mag/pdec06/t32.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primarily, the pipe provides benefit to applications where steel may rupture due to corrosion and installation time is an issue.

==Technology and history==
The idea of synthetic fibre reinforced pipe has origins in the flexible hose and offshore industry where it has been frequently used for applications such as control lines in umbilicals and production flowlines for over 30 years. However, the commercialisation and realisation of a competitive product for the onshore oil industry came from a partnership between [[Teijin Aramid]] (supplier of aramid fibre [[Twaron]]) and Wavin Repox (manufacturer of reinforced thermoset pipes), where Bert Dalmolen initiated a project to develop such a pipe. He was later employed by [[Pipelife]] where a state of the art production line was developed to produce RTP. Pipelife also developed a pipe reinforced with steel wire to achieve even higher pressure ratings of over {{convert|150|bar|MPa psi|0|abbr=on}} using steel reinforcement.
Mr Chevrier (Tubes d'Aquitaine) also developed machinery that could produce such pipes, but was not successful in commercialising RTP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polymer-age.co.uk/archive59.htm#K-M%20acquires%20reinforced%20pipe%20technology K-M acquires reinforced pipe technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205012832/http://www.polymer-age.co.uk/archive59.htm |date=2005-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Kraus-Maffei | title= Hochdruckrohre wirtschaftlich fertigen| journal= Extrusion| year= 2005| volume= 5| issue= | pages=24–27 | url=http://www.krauss-maffei.de/files.php?dl_mg_id=11&amp;file=dl_mg_1155736317.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9770">'''Richard Sears McCulloh''' (18 March 1818 – 1894) was an American [[civil engineer]] and professor of [[mechanics]] and [[thermodynamics]] at the [[Washington and Lee University]], [[Lexington, Virginia]].

==Career==

McCulloh was born on 18 March 1818 in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], United States.
He graduated from the College of New Jersey in 1836, then studied chemistry in [[Philadelphia]] with [[James Curtis Booth]] from 1838 to 1839.
From 1846 to 1849 he worked for the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia.
McCulloh was appointed professor of natural philosophy at [[Princeton University]] on 24 October 1849, and then professor of natural and experimental philosophy at [[Columbia University|Columbia College]] on 3 April 1854.{{sfn|Shearer|2006|pp=570}}

During the [[American Civil War]], McCulloh disappeared from New York after the draft riots and in October 1863 McCulloh went to [[Richmond, Virginia]] to become the consulting chemist of the Confederate [[Nitre and Mining Bureau]].{{sfn|Shearer|2006|pp=570}}
In response, Columbia College expelled him from his professorship.{{sfn|Columbia University|1868|pp=120}}
While in Richmond, he helped "the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in making a chemical weapon".{{sfn|Williams|2006}}
His experiments in creating a lethal gas were proved successful in February 1865, but before the weapon could be used in practice Richmond fell in April 1865. McCulloh fled the city but was captured two months later off the coast of Florida, and for almost two years was imprisoned in the Virginia State Penitentiary.{{sfn|Singer|2003}}

After being released, in 1866 McCulloh was appointed to the new "McCormick Professorship of Experimental Philosophy &amp; Applied Mathematics" at Washington and Lee College. 
He resigned later during financial retrenchment.&lt;ref name=census1870/&gt;
In 1869 he was a member of a faculty committee that created an expensive plan for expanding the Washington College curriculum dramatically.{{sfn|Frost|2000|pp=72}}
In January 1870 he was a Professor of Natural Philosophy at Washington College.&lt;ref name=census1870/&gt;
In 1878, McCulloh received an honorary doctorate of law degree from Washington and Lee University.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Work==

McCulloh was interested in a range of practical and scientific subjects. He prepared a plan for organizing the naval observatory.{{sfn|McCulloh|1844|pp=1}}
He wrote on the use of hydrometers to measure sugar and alcohol content of liquids, and wrote a treatise on electricity.{{sfn|McCulloh|1848|pp=1}}
He invented a method of refining California gold that involved combining the ore with zinc.
This invention was similar to an independent invention by his former teacher James Curtis Booth, and the two men agreed to combine their inventions into a single patent, which they sold to an interested industrialist.{{sfn|McCulloh|1851|pp=21}}

In 1876, a collection of McCulloh's lecture notes were published in a book entitled ''Treatise on the Mechanical Theory of Heat and its Application to the Steam Engine, Etc.'' McCulloh acknowledged the pioneering work of [[James Prescott Joule]] and [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot]] in establishing the laws of thermodynamics. He went on to say of this discipline that "there are few, if any, branches of natural science which are not more or less dependent upon the great truths under consideration". He gave as an example the view that the body of an animal was essentially a ''heat engine'', fueled by the food consumed.{{sfn|McCulloh|1876|pp=267}}

{{Infobox scandium}}
'''Scandium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Sc''' and [[atomic number]] 21. A silvery-white metallic [[d-block|d-block element]], it has historically been classified as a [[rare-earth element]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080527204340/http://www.iupac.org/publications/books/rbook/Red_Book_2005.pdf IUPAC Recommendations, NOMENCLATURE OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY]&lt;/ref&gt; together with [[yttrium]] and the [[lanthanide]]s. It was discovered in 1879 by spectral analysis of the [[mineral]]s [[euxenite]] and [[gadolinite]] from [[Scandinavia]].

Scandium is present in most of the deposits of rare-earth and [[uranium]] compounds, but it is extracted from these ores in only a few mines worldwide. Because of the low availability and the difficulties in the preparation of metallic scandium, which was first done in 1937, applications for scandium were not developed until the 1970s. The positive effects of scandium on [[aluminium alloy]]s were discovered in the 1970s, and its use in such alloys remains its only major application. The global trade of scandium oxide is about 10 [[tonne]]s per year.

The properties of scandium compounds are intermediate between those of [[aluminium]] and [[yttrium]]. A [[diagonal relationship]] exists between the behavior of [[magnesium]] and scandium, just as there is between [[beryllium]] and aluminium. In the chemical compounds of the elements in group 3, the predominant [[oxidation state]] is +3.

==Properties==

===Chemical characteristics===
Scandium is a soft metal with a silvery appearance. It develops a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when [[redox|oxidized]] by air. It is susceptible to weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute [[acids]]. It does not react with a 1:1 mixture of [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and 48% [[hydrofluoric acid]] (HF), possibly due to the formation of an impermeable [[passivation (chemistry)|passive layer]]. Scandium turnings ignite in air with a brilliant yellow flame to form [[scandium oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://periodic.lanl.gov/21.shtml Scandium]." Los Alamos National Laboratory. Retrieved 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of scandium}}
In nature, scandium is found exclusively as the [[isotope]] &lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;Sc, which has a [[nuclear spin]] of 7/2; this is its only stable isotope. Thirteen [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized with the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;Sc, which has a [[half-life]] of 83.8&amp;nbsp;days; &lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;Sc, 3.35&amp;nbsp;days; the [[positron]] emitter [[scandium-44|&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Sc]], 4 h; and &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Sc, 43.7&amp;nbsp;hours. All of the remaining [[radioactivity|radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives less than 4&amp;nbsp;hours, and the majority of these have half-lives less than 2&amp;nbsp;minutes. This element also has five [[nuclear isomer]]s, with the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;44m&lt;/sup&gt;Sc (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 58.6&amp;nbsp;h).&lt;ref name="Audi"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Audi|first= Georges|title= The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal= [[Nuclear Physics A]]|volume= 729|pages= 3–128|publisher= Atomic Mass Data Center|date= 2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A|last2= Bersillon|first2= O.|last3= Blachot|first3= J.|last4= Wapstra|first4= A. H.|url= http://hal.in2p3.fr/in2p3-00014184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The isotopes of scandium range from &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Sc to &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Sc. The primary [[decay mode]] at masses lower than the only stable isotope, &lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;Sc, is [[electron capture]], and the primary mode at masses above it is [[beta emission]]. The primary [[decay product]]s at atomic weights below &lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;Sc are [[calcium]] isotopes and the primary products from higher atomic weights are [[titanium]] isotopes.&lt;ref name="Audi"/&gt;

===Occurrence===
In [[abundance of elements in Earth's crust|Earth's crust]], scandium is not rare. Estimates vary from 18 to 25&amp;nbsp;ppm, which is comparable to the abundance of [[cobalt]] (20–30&amp;nbsp;ppm). Scandium is only the 50th most common element on Earth (35th most abundant in the crust), but it is the 23rd most common element in the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name="rubber"&gt;{{cite book|title= CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics|first= David R.|last= Lide|date= 2004|isbn= 978-0-8493-0485-9|pages= 4–28|publisher= CRC Press|location= Boca Raton}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scandium is distributed sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many [[mineral]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= F.|last= Bernhard|chapter= Scandium mineralization associated with hydrothermal lazurite-quartz veins in the Lower Austroalpie Grobgneis complex, East Alps, Austria|title= Mineral Deposits in the Beginning of the 21st Century|date= 2001|isbn= 90-265-1846-3 |publisher= Balkema |location= Lisse}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rare minerals from Scandinavia&lt;ref name="Thort"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Scandium – Mineraler I Norge|first= Roy|last= Kristiansen|journal= [[Stein (journal)|Stein]]|date= 2003|pages= 14–23|language= Norwegian|url= http://www.nags.net/Stein/2003/Sc-mineraler.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Madagascar]]&lt;ref name="Mada"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Geological Journal|volume= 22|page= 253|date= 1987|title= Mineralized pegmatites in Africa|first= O.|last= von Knorring|author2=Condliffe, E. |doi= 10.1002/gj.3350220619}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[thortveitite]], [[euxenite]], and [[gadolinite]] are the only known concentrated sources of this element. Thortveitite can contain up to 45% of scandium in the form of [[scandium oxide]].&lt;ref name="Thort"/&gt;

The stable form of scandium is created in [[supernova]]s via the [[r-process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Cameron, A.G.W.|title=Stellar Evolution, Nuclear Astrophysics, and Nucleogenesis |journal=CRL-41|date=June 1957|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/eprint/CRL-41.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
The world production of scandium is in the order of 15 tonnes per year, in the form of [[scandium oxide]]. The demand is about 50% higher, and both the production and demand keep increasing. In 2003, only three mines produced scandium: the uranium and [[iron]] mines in [[Zhovti Vody]] in [[Ukraine]], the rare-earth mines in [[Bayan Obo]], [[China]], and the apatite mines in the [[Kola peninsula]], [[Russia]]; since then many other countries have built scandium-producing facilities, including 5 tonnes/year (7.5 tonnes/year Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) by [[Nickel Asia Corporation]] and [[Sumitomo Metal Mining]] in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="SMMPressRelease"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smm.co.jp/E/news/release/uploaded_files/20160428en.pdf|title=Establishment of Scandium Recovery Operations|accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMMAbstract"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/ApprovedAbstracts/3D8E40595EA68C5C852581330004CB19?OpenDocument|publisher=TMS|first=Fumio|last=Iwamoto|title=Commercial Scandium Oxide Production by Sumitomo Metal Mining Co.

USGS.&lt;/ref&gt;

To produce metallic scandium, the oxide is converted to [[scandium fluoride]] and then [[redox|reduced]] with metallic [[calcium]].

[[Madagascar]] and the [[Iveland]]-[[Evje]] region in [[Norway]] have the only deposits of minerals with high scandium content, [[thortveitite]] (Sc,Y)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[kolbeckite]] ScPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, but these are not being exploited.&lt;ref name="USGS2015"/&gt;

The absence of reliable, secure, stable, long-term production has limited the commercial applications of scandium. Despite this low level of use, scandium offers significant benefits. Particularly promising is the strengthening of aluminium alloys with as little as 0.5% scandium. Scandium-stabilized zirconia enjoys a growing market demand for use as a high-efficiency [[electrolyte]] in [[solid oxide fuel cell]]s. &lt;!--this is crystal ball: The production of high-purity scandium oxide is proposed to commence from the NORNICO project near [[Greenvale, Queensland]] in 2013–2014.--&gt;

==Price==
Because of its rarity, scandium is among the most expensive elements. Price for pure scandium fluctuates between 4,000 and 20,000 US dollars per kilogram. Meanwhile, the limited market generates a variety of prices at any given time. In 2010, at the peak of the rare-earths shortage, the price of scandium rose to over 15,000 US dollars per kilogram, and the widely commercially used scandium oxide (Sc&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) was selling above 7 000 US dollars per kilogram. Since then the limited demand coupled with steady production keeps the price at its 20-year average.&lt;ref&gt;http://strategic-metal.com/products/scandium/scandium-price/.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compounds==
{{Category see also|Scandium compounds|Scandium minerals}}
Scandium chemistry is almost completely dominated by the trivalent ion, Sc&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. The radii of M&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in the table below indicate that the chemical properties of scandium ions have more in common with yttrium ions than with aluminium ions. In part because of this similarity, scandium is often classified as a lanthanide-like element.

===Oxides and hydroxides===
The oxide [[scandium oxide|{{chem|Sc|2|O|3}}]] and the hydroxide {{chem|Sc(OH)|3}} are [[amphoteric]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cotton, Simon |title=Lanthanide and actinide chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lvQpiVHrb78C&amp;pg=PA108|accessdate=2011-06-23|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-470-01006-8|pages=108–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

α- and γ-ScOOH are isostructural with their [[aluminium hydroxide oxide]] counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christensen|first=A.

===Halides and pseudohalides===
The [[halide]]s ScX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where X= [[scandium chloride|Cl]], [[scandium bromide|Br]], or [[scandium triiodide|I]], are very soluble in water, but [[scandium fluoride|ScF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] is insoluble. In all four halides, the scandium is 6-coordinated. The halides are [[Lewis acids]]; for example, [[scandium fluoride|ScF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] dissolves in a solution containing excess fluoride ion to form [ScF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;. The coordination number 6 is typical for Sc(III). In the larger Y&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and La&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, [[coordination number]]s of 8 and 9 are common. [[Scandium triflate]] is sometimes used as a [[Lewis acid]] catalyst in [[organic chemistry]].

===Organic derivatives===
{{Main|Organoscandium chemistry}}
Scandium forms a series of organometallic compounds with [[cyclopentadienyl complex|cyclopentadienyl]] ligands (Cp), similar to the behavior of the lanthanides. One example is the chlorine-bridged dimer, [ScCp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and related derivatives of [[pentamethylcyclopentadienyl]] ligands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Model Ziegler-Natta a-Olefin Polymerization Catalysts Derived from [{(η&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C5Me4)SiMe2(η&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-NCMe3)}(PMe3)Sc(μ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-H)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [{(η&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C5Me4)SiMe2(η&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-NCMe3)}Sc(μ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH2CH2CH3)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Uncommon oxidation states===
Compounds that feature scandium in the oxidation state other than +3 are rare but well characterized. The blue-black compound CsScCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is one of the simplest.

==History==
[[Dmitri Mendeleev]], who is referred to as the father of the [[periodic table]], predicted the existence of an element ''[[Mendeleev's predicted elements#Ekaboron and scandium|ekaboron]]'', with an [[atomic mass]] between 40 and 48 in 1869. [[Lars Fredrik Nilson]] and his team [[discovery of the chemical elements|detected this element]] in the minerals [[euxenite]] and [[gadolinite]] in 1879. Nilson prepared 2&amp;nbsp;grams of [[scandium oxide]] of high purity.&lt;ref name="Nilsonfr"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Sur l'ytterbine, terre nouvelle de M.

Nilson was apparently unaware of Mendeleev's prediction, but [[Per Teodor Cleve]] recognized the correspondence and notified Mendeleev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Sur le scandium |url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3046j/f432.table|journal= Comptes Rendus|author= Cleve, Per Teodor |volume= 89 |date= 1879|pages=419–422|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metallic scandium was produced for the first time in 1937 by [[electrolysis]] of a [[eutectic]] mixture of [[potassium]], [[lithium]], and [[scandium chloride]]s, at 700–800&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Über das metallische Scandium |journal= [[Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie]]|volume= 231 |issue= 1–2 |date= 1937 |pages= 54–62 |first= Werner|last= Fischer |author2= Brünger, Karl |author3= Grieneisen, Hans|doi= 10.1002/zaac.19372310107|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first pound of 99% pure scandium metal was produced in 1960.

====Red giant stars near the [[Galactic Center]]====

In early 2018, evidence was gathered from [[spectrometer]] data of significant scandium, [[vanadium]] and [[yttrium]] abundances in [[red giant]] stars in the [[Nuclear Star Cluster]] (NSC) in the [[Galactic Center]]. Further research showed that this was an illusion caused by the relatively low temperature (below 3,500 K) of these stars masking the abundance signals, and that this phenomenon was observable in other red giants.&lt;ref name=””&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aadb97 Evidence against Anomalous Compositions for Giants in the Galactic Nuclear Star Cluster], B.

==Investigation findings==
[[File: SQ006 broken tail section.jpg|thumb|The broken off tail section of the 9V-SPK.]]

An investigation into the accident was conducted by the [[Aviation Safety Council]] (ASC) of the Republic of China. The final report was issued by the ASC on 24 April 2002. In the report section "Findings Related to Probable Causes," which detailed factors that played a major role in the circumstances leading to the accident, it was stated that the flight crew did not review the taxi route, despite having all the relevant charts, and as a result did not know the aircraft had entered the wrong runway. Upon entering the wrong runway, the flight crew had neglected to check the para visual display (PVD) and the [[primary flight display]] (PFD), which would have indicated that the aircraft was lined up on the wrong runway. According to the ASC, these errors, coupled with the imminent arrival of the typhoon and the poor weather conditions, caused the flight crew to lose situational awareness and led them to attempt to take off from the wrong runway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boeing 747-412 9V-SPK Accident Description|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20001031-0|publisher=Aviation Safety Network|accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- It's unclear to me why this matters; if someone can enlighten me, please explain on Talk and remove this comment: Under the report's 'Findings Related to Risk', which are risky or unsafe elements identified in the investigation that may or may not have contributed to the accident, one of the factors mentioned was that the first series of taxiway lights leading to Runway 05L was damaged. --&gt;

Volume 26, Number 45.&lt;/ref&gt; the airline statement was later revised to state that fatalities occurred.

The airline initially stated that reports of the aircraft taking the wrong runway were untrue before the fact that the wrong runway was used was proven true.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1003077.stm International effort to find crash cause]."

==Contesting investigation findings==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2009}}
The report by ASC was deemed controversial by Singapore's [[Ministry of Transport (Singapore)|Ministry of Transport]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mot.gov.sg/News-Centre/News/2002/Singapore-MOT-s-Comments-To-The-Final-Report-Of-The-Investigation-Into-The-SQ006-Accident/|title=Singapore MOT's Comments to the Final Report of the Investigation into The SQ006 Accident|date=26 April 2002|publisher=[[Ministry of Transport (Singapore)|Ministry of Transport]]|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore Airlines and the [[International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations]] (IFALPA), among others.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Singaporean officials protested that the report did not present a full account of the incident and was incomplete, as responsibility for the accident appeared to have been placed mainly on the flight crew of SQ006, while other equally valid contributing factors had been played down. The team from Singapore that participated in the investigation felt that the lighting and signage at the airport did not measure up to international standards. Some critical lights were missing or not working. No barriers or markings were put up at the start of the closed runway, which would have alerted the flight crew that they were on the wrong runway. The Singapore team felt that these two factors were given less weight than was proper, as another flight crew had almost made the same mistake of using runway 05R to take off days before the accident.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Singapore Airlines also issued a statement after the release of the ASC report. In their statement, Singapore Airlines reiterated the points brought up by the Singapore investigators and added that [[air traffic control]] (ATC) did not follow their own procedure when they gave clearance for SQ006 to take off despite ATC's not being able to see the aircraft. Singapore Airlines also clarified that the para visual display (PVD) was meant to help the flight crew maintain the runway centerline in poor visibility, rather than to identify the runway in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0UBT/is_10_15/ai_71324788/|title=Investigation to Focus on Human Factors and Emergency Evacuation|date=5 March 2001|work=CBS Business Network|publisher=[[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS)]]|accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement by Kay Yong (T: 戎 凱, P: ''Rēng Kǎi''), managing director of the Republic of China's [[Aviation Safety Council]], implied that [[pilot error]] played a major role in the crash of the Boeing 747-400, which led to the deaths of 83 people. He stated that the airport should have placed markers stating that the runway was closed to takeoffs and landings.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1185522.stm Airport criticised over Taiwan crash]." ''[[BBC]]''. Friday 23 February 2001. Retrieved 3 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, airport runways that are closed are not normally lighted, to make it clear they are not in use. At Chiang Kai-Shek International Airport, a single switch controlled green lights on the common taxiway to both runways and on the centreline of runway 05R. Civil Aeronautics Administration Deputy Director Chang Kuo-cheng said runway 05L was fully lit on Tuesday night by white and yellow lights and only the green centreline lighting was illuminated on closed runway 05R. On the taxiway to the runways, four large signs point the way to runway 05L, he added, and he refused to state explicitly that pilot error was the primary cause of the mix-up.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Runway 05R was not blocked off by barriers because part of the strip was used by landing planes to taxi back to the [[airport terminal]].
The pilot confirmed twice with the control tower that he was on the correct runway; controllers did not know the plane had actually gone on to the wrong runway because the airport lacked ground radar and the plane was out of sight of the tower at the time of its takeoff attempt.&lt;ref name="ASCReport"/&gt;

==Actions of flight crew and flight attendants==
John Wiggans, a survivor of the crash, stated in a ''[[USA Today]]'' article that the staff were unable to help the passengers escape from the aircraft due to being frozen by fear and/or due to lack of competence in emergency procedures; Wiggans was seated in the upper deck business class area.&lt;ref name="singapore-window1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.singapore-window.org/sw00/001216au.htm |title=The tragedy of flight SQ006 |publisher=Singapore-window.org |date= |accessdate=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Straits Times]]'' carried reports of flight attendants saving lives of passengers.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/63176176.html?dids=63176176&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS&amp;date=Nov+3%2C+2000&amp;author=Andrew+Perrin&amp;pub=USA+TODAY&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=16.A&amp;desc=Jet+crew+did+more+harm+than+good%2C+survivors+say Jet crew did more harm than good, survivors say]," ''[[USA Today]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.singapore-window.org/sw00/001103us.htm Jet crew did more harm than good, survivors say]," hosted at singapore-window.org&lt;/ref&gt; One story from the newspaper stated that Irene Ang Miau Lee (洪妙丽 ''Hóng Miàolì'')&lt;ref name=LianheZaobaonames/&gt; escaped the crash, ran back into the aircraft to attempt to save passengers, and died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysia.net/lists/sangkancil/2000-11/msg00205.html &amp;#91;sangkancil&amp;#93; SIA Crash: Irene Ang: Devoted to her dream job, till her la&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206062448/http://www.malaysia.net/lists/sangkancil/2000-11/msg00205.html |date=6 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A passenger sitting in seat 17A stated that the Right Upper Deck Door flight attendant directed him to the main deck via the stairs. The flight attendant died&lt;ref name="ASCReport"/&gt; (Pg. 108/508).

Upper deck passengers and flight attendants stated that the Crew-In-Charge flight attendant (CIC) travelled upstairs after the first impact; the Crew-In-Charge flight attendant died&lt;ref name="ASCReport"/&gt; (Pg. 109/508).

After the release of the ASC report, [[Republic of China]] public [[prosecutors]] called upon the flight crew of SQ006 to return to the ROC for questioning and the three-member crew complied. Rumours abounded at the time that the pilots might be detained in the ROC and charged with negligence. IFALPA had previously stated that it would advise its members of the difficulties of operating into the ROC if the flight crew of SQ006 were prosecuted. The prosecutors did not press charges and the flight crew were allowed to leave the ROC.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The accident aircraft 9V-SPK was painted in Singapore Airlines special promotion livery, a scheme called "Tropical", at the time of the accident. The special [[livery]] was intended to promote Singapore Airlines new first class and business class products. After the accident, 9V-SPK's sister aircraft, 9V-SPL, the only other aircraft painted with the promotional livery, was immediately removed from service and repainted with standard Singapore Airlines livery. Not until 2015 would another Singapore Airline's airframe be painted in any livery other than the standard for Singapore Airlines or [[Star Alliance]].

Dozens of survivors and relatives of those killed filed lawsuits against the airline and ROC authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=45 survivors, families sue Singapore Airlines over Taiwan crash |url=http://www.sfdonline.org/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/01Pf/afp311001.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030323191127/http://www.sfdonline.org/Link%20Pages/Link%20Folders/01Pf/afp311001.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 March 2003 |date=31 October 2001 |publisher=Agence France-Presse |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a Taiwanese High Prosecutor's decision to not prosecute the pilots for the first three years after the crash, Singapore Airlines subsequently fired the captain and first officer in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = SIA sacks SQ006 pilots | url =http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2002/07/27/0000153709  | date = 27 July 2002 | publisher = ''[[Taipei Times]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10068">[[File:UC Solar Team Logo.jpg|thumb|300px|right|University of Calgary Solar Team Logo]]
The '''University of Calgary Solar Car Team''' is a multi-disciplinary student-run [[solar car racing]] ("raycing") team at the [[University of Calgary]], based in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. It was established to design and build a solar car to compete in the [[American Solar Challenge]] (ASC) (previously named the North American Solar Challenge) and the [[World Solar Challenge]] (WSC). The team is primarily composed of undergraduate students studying Engineering, Business, Science, Arts and Kinesiology. The mission of the University of Calgary Solar Car Team is to educate the community about sustainable energy and to serve as an interdisciplinary project through which students and faculty from various departments can collaborate in supporting sustainable energy.

== History ==
The University of Calgary Solar Car Team was established in the fall of 2004. The team was created to build a solar powered vehicle to complete in the 2005 North American Solar Challenge.

[[Image:UCSolarX1-StampedeParade-Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|400px|right|This is an image of the X1, the prototype solar car created by the UC Solar team for testing purposes. In this image it is being piloted by driver James Snell for the [[Calgary Stampede Parade]] in the summer of 2005.]]

==Soleon==

===Miracle workers===
The team performed a "miracle" by managing to establish a strong student base with which to construct the car, procure significant sponsorship and successfully build a highly successful vehicle with limited experience all in approximately 9 months. Established teams have two years to refine existing designs between [[Solar car racing|rayces]].

=== The X1 (prototype) ===
In preparation for its first rayce, the University of Calgary Solar Team constructed and tested a prototype of their designs before building the final car. The X1 was a mock-up of and predecessor to Soleon. The X1 was used for driver training and allowed the team to test various design decisions to help ensure a successful final product. The X1 was constructed from a steel chassis with a [[fibreglass]] shell which was coated with [[gelcoat]] which made the vehicle approximately twice the final weight of its sister car.

=== First race results ===
In its first year of existence the University of Calgary Solar Team successfully competed in the NASC and the WSC. In the 2005 NASC, Soleon, their first generation rayce car placed 13th out of 17 cars that made it to the finish line.  In the 2005 WSC Soleon placed 10th overall (out of 18) and first in its class.  After hearing about this success, [[Seymour Schulich]] was inspired to donate $25 million (another $25 million was matched by the Alberta government) to the University of Calgary Engineering department, which was renamed the [[Schulich School of Engineering]].

==Schulich I==

=== 2007 WSC race ===
Since the success of Soleon in the 2005 races, the team had to redesign for the new regulations for WSC, and prepare for the harder competition it faced from changing class to the higher, more competitive Challenge class. This class included higher efficiency [[solar cell]]s, upright seating, and teams that had been raycing for the last 20 years. After shipping their new car to Australia, and testing it before scrutineering, the car had a rear tire blow out on the race track in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], and resulted in the car spinning around having the tail section impacting into the guard rail and ripped from the car. The team then had to rebuild and redesign the tail section in one night before racing. Despite the higher competition and race track crash, the team managed to be the first (of six) Canadian teams to cross the timing finish line, finish 8th (out of 19) in the Challenge class, and 15th (out of 37) overall.

=== 2008 NASC race ===
Schulich I was improved after WSC 2007 for racing in the 2008 North American Solar Challenge. The rayce from Dallas, Texas to Calgary lasted ten days, with the University of Calgary Solar Team placing 6th (out of 15).

==Schulich Axiom==

=== 2010 ASC ===
The University of Calgary's 3rd generation car, Schulich Axiom, was first raced in the 2010 ASC. The race spanned 1770&amp;nbsp;km from Tulsa, Oklahoma to Chicago, Illinois. The team finished in 6th place (of 18 teams) and received both the Sportsmanship and Mechanical Engineering awards for the race. With regulation changes for the 2011 WSC, the team re-engineered the design of Schulich Axiom and completely rebuilt the solar car. Some of the changes made include switching to silicon solar cells and reducing the weight of the car.&lt;ref&gt;The car was unveiled November 2009 to a sold out crowd at the Fairmont Palliser Hotel in Calgary, Alberta.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011 WSC ===
The 2011 WSC takes place October 16–23, 2011 and runs from Darwin, Northern Territory to Adelaide, South Australia. The University of Calgary Solar Team has entered Schulich Axiom in the race.

The '''TORRO tornado intensity scale''' (or '''T-Scale''') is a scale measuring [[tornado]] intensity between T0 and T11. It was proposed by Terence Meaden of the [[Tornado and Storm Research Organisation (TORRO)]], a [[meteorology|meteorological]] organisation in the [[United Kingdom]], as an extension of the [[Beaufort scale]].

== History and derivation from Beaufort scale ==
The scale was tested from 1972 to 1975 and was made public at a meeting of the [[Royal Meteorological Society]] in 1975. The scale sets T0 as the equivalent of 8 on the Beaufort scale and is related to the Beaufort scale (B) by the formula:

: ''B'' = 2 (''T'' + 4)

and conversely:

: ''T'' = (''B''/2 - 4)

The [[Beaufort scale]] was first introduced in 1805, and in 1921 quantified. It expresses the wind speed (v) by the formula:

: [[Speed|v]] = 0.837 ''B''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt; [[Metre per second|m/s]]

== TORRO scale formula ==
Most UK tornadoes are T6 or below with the strongest known UK tornado being a T8. For comparison, the strongest detected winds in a United States tornado (during the [[1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak]]) would be T11 using the following formulae:

: ''[[Speed|v]]'' = 2.365 (''T''+4)&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt; [[Metre per second|m/s]]
: ''[[Speed|v]]'' = 8.511 (''T''+4)&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt; [[Kilometres per hour|km/h]]
: ''[[Speed|v]]'' = 5.289 (''T''+4)&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt; [[Miles per hour|mph]]
: ''[[Speed|v]]'' = 4.596 (''T''+4)&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt; [[Knot (unit)|kn]]

where ''v'' is [[wind speed]] and ''T'' is TORRO intensity number. Wind speed is defined as a 3-second gust at 10 [[metre|m]] [[Above ground level|AGL]].

Alternatively, the T-Scale formula may be expressed as:

: [[Speed|v]] = 0.837 (2''T''+8)&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt; [[Metre per second|m/s]]
or
: [[Speed|v]] = 0.837(2&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;) (''T''+4)&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt; [[Metre per second|m/s]]
: or
: &lt;math&gt;T = (v/2.365) ^{2/3}-4&lt;/math&gt;

== Rating process and comparisons to Fujita scale ==
TORRO claims it differs from the [[Fujita scale]] in that it is "purely" a wind speed scale, whereas the Fujita scale relies on damage for classification, but in practice, damage is utilised almost exclusively in both systems to infer intensity. That is because such a proxy for intensity is usually all that is available, although users of both scales would prefer direct, objective, quantitative measurements. The scale is primarily used in the United Kingdom whereas the Fujita scale is the primary scale used in North America, continental Europe, and the rest of the world.

At the 2004 European Conference on Severe Storms, Dr. Meaden proposed a unification of the TORRO and Fujita scales as the Tornado Force or TF Scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meaden |first=Terence |author2=TORRO members |title=Tornado Force or TF Scale |publisher=Tornado and Storm Research Organisation |year=2004 |url=http://www.torro.org.uk/TORRO/ECSS_Slide_Show/2004%20SPAIN%20ECSS%20Post-FINAL%20slide%20show.html |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430211910/http://www.torro.org.uk/TORRO/ECSS_Slide_Show/2004%20SPAIN%20ECSS%20Post-FINAL%20slide%20show.html |archivedate=2010-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 in the United States, the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]] replaced the original Fujita Scale from 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grazulis |first=Tom |authorlink=Thomas P.

Unlike with the F scale, no analyses have been undertaken at all to establish the veracity and accuracy of the T scale damage descriptors. The scale was written in the early 1970s, and does not take into account changes such as the growth in weight of vehicles or the great reduction in numbers and change of type of railway locomotives,{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} and was written in an environment where tornadoes of F2 or stronger are extremely rare, so little or no first-hand investigation of actual damage at the upper end of the scale was possible. The TORRO scale has more graduations than the F scale which makes it arguably more useful for tornadoes on the lower end of the scale{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}; however, such accuracy and precision are not typically attainable in practice. [[Harold E. Brooks|Brooks]] and [[Charles A. Doswell III|Doswell]] stated that "the problems associated with damage surveys and uncertainties associated with estimating wind speed from observed damage make highly precise assignments dubious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Brooks |first = Harold |authorlink = Harold E. Brooks |author2=Charles A. Doswell III |title = Some aspects of the international climatology of tornadoes by damage classification |journal = Atmospheric Research |volume = 56 |issue = 1-4 |pages = 191–201 |publisher = |location = |year = 2001 |url = http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/toulclim.html |doi = 10.1016/S0169-8095(00)00098-3 |bibcode = 2001AtmRe..56..191B }}&lt;/ref&gt; In survey reports, Fujita ratings sometimes also have extra qualifications added ("minimal F2" or "upper-end F3 damage"), made by investigators who have experience of many similar tornadoes and relating to the fact that the F scale is a damage scale, not a wind speed scale.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Tornadoes are rated after they have passed and have been examined, not whilst in progress. In rating the intensity of a tornado, both direct measurements and inferences from empirical observations of the effects of a tornado are used. Few [[anemometer]]s are struck by a tornado, and even fewer survive, so there are very few [[in-situ]] measurements. Therefore, almost all ratings are obtained from [[remote sensing]] techniques or as [[Proxy (climate)|proxies]] from damage surveys. [[Weather radar]] is used when available, and sometimes [[photogrammetry]] or [[videogrammetry]] estimates wind speed by measuring tracers in the vortex. In most cases, aerial and ground damage surveys of structures and vegetation are utilised, sometimes with engineering analysis. Also sometimes available are ground swirl patterns ([[cycloidal]] marks) left in the wake of a tornado. If an on site analysis is not possible, either for retrospective ratings or when personnel cannot reach a site, photographs, videos, or descriptions of damage may be utilised.

== TORRO scale parameters ==
The 12 categories for the '''TORRO scale''' are listed below, in order of increasing intensity. Although the wind speeds and photographic damage examples are updated, which are more or less still accurate.{{cn|date=June 2016}} However, for the actual '''TORRO scale''' in practice, damage indicators (the type of structure which has been damaged) are predominantly used in determining the tornado intensity.

'''Tamala Park''' is an unpopulated locality in [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]]. It sits on the border between the [[City of Wanneroo]] and the [[City of Joondalup]] local authorities, and separates the [[Clarkson, Western Australia|Clarkson]]-[[Butler, Western Australia|Butler]] region from the suburbs of Joondalup.

== History ==
The [[Mooro]] group of [[Noongar]] were familiar with the area, and several of their traditional stories and legends refer to local Tamala Park land features, such as [[Wagyl|Waukolup]] Hill, although evidence suggests that they lived much further east, closer to modern-day [[Wanneroo Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trails.heritage.wa.gov.au/ht_pdf/YaberooBudjara.pdf|format=PDF|title=Yaberoo Budjara Heritage Trail|author=Heritage Council of WA|date=June 1998|accessdate=2007-01-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820011810/http://trails.heritage.wa.gov.au/ht_pdf/YaberooBudjara.pdf|archivedate=20 August 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suburb was formally established by excision of parts of [[Mindarie, Western Australia|Mindarie]], [[Clarkson, Western Australia|Clarkson]] and [[Burns Beach, Western Australia|Burns Beach]] on 9 September 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Gazette WA|title=Naming and Change of Name of Localities. City of Wanneroo|date=9 September 1988|page=1988:3497|file=1421/983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present use ==
At present, Tamala Park is mostly unoccupied [[bushland]], primarily used as a [[landfill]] and [[recycling]] centre. Two arterial roads, [[Marmion Avenue]] and [[Connolly Drive]], run through it and link the suburbs on each side. It is a large locality, extending from the [[Joondalup railway line]] in the east, to the coast of the Indian Ocean, where it leads onto [[Burns Beach, Western Australia|Burns Beach]] to the south and Claytons Beach in Mindarie to the north.

Tamala Park is in the process of being developed. The Tamala Park Regional Council (TPRC) was established to develop {{convert|165|ha}} of land in the Tamala Park locality. The Council comprises 12 councillors representing the 7 owner councils that make up the TPRC as follows:

* [[Town of Cambridge]]
* [[City of Joondalup]]
* [[City of Perth]]
* [[City of Stirling]]
* [[City of Wanneroo]]
* [[Town of Victoria Park]]
* [[City of Vincent]]

Tamala Park is the 10th regional and 154th local government council to be established by proclamation in the Government Gazette in February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamalapark.wa.gov.au|title=Tamala Park Regional Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Gazette WA|title=Local Government Act 1995: Establishment of a Regional Council|date=3 February 2006|page=2006:535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tetramethylammonium''' ('''TMA''') or ('''Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''') is the simplest [[quaternary ammonium cation]], consisting of four [[methyl group]]s attached to a central [[nitrogen]] atom, and is [[isoelectronic]] with [[neopentane]]. It is positively charged and can only be isolated in association with a [[counter-ion]].  Common [[quaternary ammonium salt|salts]] include [[tetramethylammonium chloride]] and [[tetramethylammonium hydroxide]]. Tetramethylammonium salts are used in chemical synthesis and are widely employed in pharmacological research.

==Common nomenclature==
In the toxicological literature, ''naturally occurring'' tetramethylammonium (anion unspecified) is often referred to by the name "tetramine". Unfortunately, this non-systematic or "trivial" name is also used for other chemical entities, including a toxic rodenticide ([[Tetramethylenedisulfotetramine]]). Similarly, the acronym "TMA", which is frequently used for tetramethylammonium in the pharmacological literature, may also refer to the investigational drug [[3,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine]], which, being a close structural analog of [[mescaline]], has been the subject of numerous publications.

==Occurrence==
TMA has been detected in or isolated from a number of marine organisms, mostly amongst the [[Cnidaria]] and [[Mollusca]], notably in some species of ''[[Neptunea]]'' (commonly called [[whelks]]) that are eaten by humans.&lt;ref name = Ant&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anthoni | first1 = U. | last2 = Bohlin | first2 = L. | last3 = Larsen | first3 = C. | last4 = Nielsen | first4 = P. | last5 = Nielsen | first5 = N.

==Preparation, reactions, solution properties==
One of the most straightforward methods of preparing a simple salt containing the tetramethylammonium ion is by the reaction between [[trimethylamine]] and a [[alkyl halide|methyl halide]]:
:Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N + Me&amp;minus;I → Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

[&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]-labeled TMA has been made by this method.&lt;ref name = Tsu&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tsubaki | first1 = H. | last2 = Nakajima | first2 = E. | last3 = Komai | first3 = T. | last4 = Shindo | first4 = H. | year = 1986 | title = The relation between structure and distribution of quaternary ammonium ions in mice and rats.

Pharmacobio-Dyn. | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 737–746 | doi=10.1248/bpb1978.9.737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this reaction is suitable for the common halides, tetramethylammonium salts with more complex anions may be prepared by [[salt metathesis]] reactions, e.g. [[tetramethylammonium borohydride]] has been made from [[tetramethylammonium hydroxide]] as shown:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Banus | first1 = M. D. | last2 = Bragdon | first2 = R. W. | last3 = Gibb | first3 = T. R. P. | year = 1952 | title = Preparation of quaternary ammonium borohydrides from sodium and lithium borohydrides | url = | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 2346–2348 | doi=10.1021/ja01129a048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[OH]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Me&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

Although TMA salts do possess some of the [[phase-transfer catalyst|phase-transfer catalytic]] properties that are characteristic of [[quaternary ammonium compounds]], they tend to behave atypically because of the relatively  high ''[[hydrophilicity]]'' of the TMA cation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fedorynski | first1 = M. | last2 = Ziolkowska | first2 = W. | last3 = Jonczyk | first3 = A. | year = 1993 | title = Tetramethylammonium salts: highly selective catalysts for the preparation of gem-dichlorocyclopropanes from electrophilic alkenes and chloroform under phase-transfer catalysis conditions | url = | journal = J. Org. Chem. | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 6120–6121 | doi=10.1021/jo00074a047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TMA cation is [[hydrophilic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koga | first1 = Y. | last2 = Westh | first2 = P. | last3 = Nishikawa | first3 = K. | last4 = Subramanian | first4 = S. | year = 2011 | title = Is a methyl group always hydrophobic?

In the TMA cation, the methyl groups are tetrahedrally arranged around the central N atom, as is evident from X-ray crystallographic studies of various of its salts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLean | first1 = W.

==Pharmacology==
The pharmacological literature on tetramethylammonium is extensive.&lt;ref&gt;Over 1300 citations in PubMed, as of October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, TMA is a [[cholinomimetic]] whose effects mimic most of those produced by exogenous [[acetylcholine]].&lt;ref&gt;''Drill's Pharmacology in Medicine, 4th Ed.'' (1971), J. R. DiPalma, Ed., p. McGraw-Hill, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmacological experiments with TMA have been performed using one of its salts, typically the chloride, bromide or iodide, since these anions were not expected to interfere with the actions of the TMA cation. In the early pharmacological literature, however, there are references to the use of "[[tetramethylammonium hydroxide]]" or "tetramethylammonium hydrate", which were meant to facilitate comparison between weight-based dosages of different TMA salts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burn | first1 = J. H. | last2 = Dale | first2 = H. H. | year = 1915 | title = The action of certain quaternary ammonium bases | url = | journal = J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 417–438 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not involve the actual use of tetramethylammonium hydroxide, whose strong basicity would have been incompatible with physiological conditions.&lt;ref name = Ant/&gt;

A thorough review of the pharmacology of TMA from a toxicological perspective, and current up to 1989, has been given by Anthoni and co-workers.&lt;ref name = Ant/&gt; Thus, the effects of TMA on [[nicotinic]] and [[muscarinic]] [[ACh receptor]]s first stimulate, then block neurotransmission in sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia, with [[depolarization]]. TMA also acts as an [[agonist]] at muscarinic receptors in post-ganglionic nerve endings in [[smooth muscle]]s, cardiac muscle, and [[exocrine]] glands. In [[skeletal muscle]], TMA initially causes [[fasciculation]]s, then paralysis, as a result of the depolarization from stimulation of nicotinic ACh receptors.

===Absorption; distribution; metabolism; excretion (ADME)===
Absorption: TMA is readily absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract.&lt;ref name = Ant/&gt; Studies on the rat [[jejunum]] indicated that TMA absorption involved a combination of simple diffusion and carrier-mediated transport, with nearly 100% absorption occurring within 60 to 90 minutes. By comparison, [[tetraethylammonium]] and tetrapropylammonium ions were only absorbed to the extent of ~30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tsubaki | first1 = H. | last2 = Komai | first2 = T. | year = 1986 | title = Intestinal absorption of tetramethylammonium and its derivatives in rats | url = | journal = J. Pharmacobio-Dyn. | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 747–754 | doi=10.1248/bpb1978.9.747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distribution: [[Intraperitoneal]] administration of radio-labeled tetramethylammonium iodide to mice showed that TMA was rapidly distributed to all parts of the body, with the highest concentrations being in the kidney and liver.&lt;ref name = Tsu/&gt; Similar results were reported by Neef and co-workers using rats.&lt;ref name = Neef&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neef | first1 = C. | last2 = Oosting | first2 = R. | last3 = Meijer | first3 = D. K. F | year = 1984 | title = Structure-pharmacokinetics relationship of quaternary ammonium compounds | url = | journal = Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmakol. | volume = 328 | issue = | pages = 103–110 | doi=10.1007/bf00512058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metabolism and excretion: Parenteral administration of  radio-labeled tetramethylammonium iodide to rats resulted in almost the whole dose being excreted in urine, without any evidence of metabolic transformation.&lt;ref name = Neef/&gt;

==Toxicology==
The human toxicology of TMA (under the name "tetramine" has been studied primarily in the context
of accidental poisoning after ingestion of ''Neptunea'' species.&lt;ref name = Ant/&gt; Symptoms include the following: nausea, vomiting, headache, vertigo/dizziness, impaired vision/temporary blindness, [[diplopia]], [[photophobia]], lack of balance, feeling of intoxication and [[urticaria]]. These symptoms appear within 30 minutes but recovery is usually complete after a few hours. Only one account of human death following ingestion of TMA (from the plant ''Courbonia virgata'') has been recorded.&lt;ref name = Hen/&gt;
Although many of these symptoms can be accounted for on the basis of impairment of neurotransmission in the [[autonomic nervous system]], there also seem to be distinct indications of central affects.&lt;ref name = Ant/&gt;

In animal studies, parenteral administration of TMA-containing extracts from ''Neptunea'' to mice, cats and fish mainly show effects involving skeletal muscles: there are muscular [[fasciculation]]s, convulsions, loss of  balance, motor paralysis and ultimately cessation of respiration.&lt;ref name = Ant/&gt;

The lethal oral dose of TMA for humans has been estimated at 3–4&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref name = Ant/&gt;&lt;ref name = Hen/&gt; The lethal dose for rats was estimated to be ~45–50&amp;nbsp;mg/kg, p.o., and ~15&amp;nbsp;mg/kg, i.p.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anthoni | first1 = U. | last2 = Bohlin | first2 = L. | last3 = Larsen | first3 = C. | last4 = Nielsen | first4 = P. | last5 = Nielsen | first5 = N.

===Acute toxicity===
LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; for TMA chloride: 25&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (mouse, i.p.); 40&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (mouse, s.c.).
LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; for TMA chloride: 462&amp;nbsp;mg/L for 96 hrs. (Fathead minnow, ''Pimephales promelas'').

{{distinguish|This Is Our Land}}
'''The Land is Ours''' is a British [[land rights]] campaign advocating access to the land, its resources, and the planning processes set up in 1995 by [[George Monbiot]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Monbiot |first=George |author-link= |publication-date= |date=22 February 1995 |year= |title=A Land Reform Manifesto |periodical=The Guardian |publication-place=London |place= |url=http://www.monbiot.com/archives/1995/02/22/a-land-reform-manifesto/#more-625 |issn= |doi= |oclc= |accessdate=2008-08-06 |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AMonbiot+intitle%3AA+Land+Reform+Manifesto&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517032438/http://www.monbiot.com/archives/1995/02/22/a-land-reform-manifesto/ |archivedate=May 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first campaign was the occupation of the disused [[Wisley Airfield]] in [[Surrey]] by 400 people in 1995, from which there was a live broadcast on the BBC's ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme. Nearby [[St. George's Hill]] is symbolically significant as the site of a 1649 protest, when the [[Diggers]] planted vegetables on the [[common land]] there. 

Throughout the summer of 1996, the group set up Pure Genius!!, an [[eco-village]] on a derelict former distillery site owned by [[Guinness]] in [[Wandsworth]], [[London]]. The [[Squatting|squatted]] community was evicted the day before the [[London Wildlife Trust]] were meeting to officially designate it as a conservation site containing many species of flowers and birds classed as extremely rare in London.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

On 1 April 1999, on the 350th anniversary of [[Gerrard Winstanley]] and the Diggers' occupation of the same hill, The Land Is Ours organised a rally, then occupied land at St. Georges Hill near Weybridge, Surrey.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

In April 2004, The Land Is Ours occupied [[Castell Henllys]], a tourist site with reconstructed [[Iron Age]] [[roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouses]], in protest at [[Pembrokeshire Coast National Park]]'s decision to demolish [[That Roundhouse]] at nearby [[Brithdir Mawr]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

In 2009, a group inspired by The Land Is Ours opened [[Kew Bridge Eco Village]], a squat on land owned by property developers [[Berkeley Group Holdings|St George]]; this was evicted on 27 May 2010.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[File:Thin-film_transistor_variants_EN.svg|thumb|right|300px|Several types of TFT constructions.]]
A '''thin-film transistor''' ('''TFT''') is a special kind of [[field-effect transistor]] made by depositing [[thin film]]s of an active [[semiconductor]] layer as well as the [[dielectric]] layer and [[metal]]lic contacts over a supporting (but non-conducting) [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]].  A common substrate is [[glass]], because the primary application of TFTs is in [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs). This differs from the conventional [[transistor]], where the semiconductor material typically ''is'' the substrate, such as a [[silicon wafer]].

== Manufacture==

TFTs can be made using a wide variety of semiconductor materials.  A common material is [[silicon]].  The characteristics of a silicon-based TFT depend on the silicon's [[crystal]]line state; that is, the semiconductor layer can be either [[amorphous silicon]],&lt;ref name=Kanicki1&gt;{{cite book |last=Kanicki |first=Jerzy |title=Amorphous &amp; Microcystalline Semiconductor Devices Volume II: Materials and Device Physics |publisher=Artech House, Inc. |date=1992 |isbn=0-89006-379-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[microcrystalline silicon]],&lt;ref name=Kanicki1/&gt; or it can be [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealed]] into [[polysilicon]].

Other materials which have been used as semiconductors in TFTs include [[compound semiconductor]]s such as [[cadmium selenide]],&lt;ref name="Brody1"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Brody |first = T. Peter |title=The Thin Film Transistor - A Late Flowering Bloom |journal=IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices |volume=31 |issue =11 |pages =1614–1628 |date=November 1984 |doi=10.1109/T-ED.1984.21762}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brody2"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Brody |first = T. Peter |title=The birth and early childhood of active matrix - a personal memoir |journal=Journal of the SID|volume=4/3|pages =113–127|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; or metal oxides such as zinc oxide&lt;ref name="WagerZnO"/&gt; or [[hafnium oxide]]. An application for hafnium oxide is as a [[high-κ dielectric]].&lt;ref name="ChunChang2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chun|first1=Yoon Soo|last2=Chang|first2=Seongpil|last3=Lee|first3=Sang Yeol|title=Effects of gate insulators on the performance of a-IGZO TFT fabricated at room-temperature|journal=Microelectronic Engineering|volume=88|issue=7|year=2011|pages=1590–1593|issn=0167-9317|doi=10.1016/j.mee.2011.01.076}}&lt;/ref&gt; TFTs have also been made using organic materials, referred to as [[organic field-effect transistor]]s or OTFTs.

By using transparent semiconductors and transparent [[electrode]]s, such as [[indium tin oxide]] (ITO), some TFT devices can be made completely transparent. Such transparent TFTs (TTFTs) can be used for construction of video display panels.
''
Because conventional substrates cannot withstand high annealing temperatures, the deposition process must be completed under relatively low temperatures. [[Chemical vapor deposition]] and [[physical vapor deposition]] (usually [[sputtering]]) are applied.  The first solution-processed TTFTs, based on [[zinc oxide]], were reported in 2003 by researchers at [[Oregon State University]].&lt;ref name="WagerZnO"&gt;Wager, John. [http://oregonstate.edu/dept/ncs/newsarch/2003/Mar03/transparent.htm OSU Engineers Create World's First Transparent Transistor] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915004017/http://oregonstate.edu/dept/ncs/newsarch/2003/Mar03/transparent.htm |date=2007-09-15 }}. College of Engineering, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR: OSU News &amp; Communication, 2003. 29 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese laboratory CENIMAT at the [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]] has produced the world's first completely transparent TFT at room temperature.

== Applications ==

The best known application of thin-film transistors is in [[TFT LCD]]s, an implementation of [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]] technology. Transistors are embedded within the panel itself, reducing [[crosstalk]] between [[pixel]]s and improving image stability.

{{As of|2008}}, many color [[LCD television|LCD TV]]s and monitors use this technology. TFT panels are frequently used in [[Digital data|digital]] [[radiography]] applications in general radiography. A TFT is used in both direct and indirect capture{{Technical statement|date=April 2013}} as a base for the image receptor in [[medical radiography]].

AMOLED ([[Active-matrix liquid-crystal display|active-matrix]] [[organic light-emitting diode]]) screens also contain a TFT layer.

The most beneficial aspect{{POV statement|date=April 2013}} of TFT technology is its use of a separate transistor for each pixel on the display. Because each transistor is small, the amount of charge needed to control it is also small. This allows for very fast re-drawing of the display.

A '''tidal stream generator''', often referred to as a '''tidal energy converter''' ('''TEC'''), is a machine that extracts [[energy]] from moving masses of water, in particular [[tides]], although the term is often used in reference to machines designed to extract energy from run of river or tidal estuarine sites. Certain types of these machines function very much like underwater [[wind turbine]]s, and are thus often referred to as '''tidal turbines'''. They were first conceived in the 1970s during the oil crisis.&lt;ref name="ASAP. Web. 8 October 2009"&gt;Jones, Anthony T., and Adam Westwood. "Power from the oceans: wind energy industries are growing, and as we look for alternative power sources, the growth potential is through the roof. Two industry watchers take a look at generating energy from wind and wave action and the potential to alter." The Futurist 39.1 (2005): 37(5). GALE Expanded Academic ASAP. Web. 8  October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tidal stream generators are the cheapest and the least ecologically damaging among the [[Tidal power#Generating methods|three main forms]] of [[tidal power]] generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tidal power|url=http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/EandE/Web_sites/01-02/RE_info/Tidal%20Power.htm#streams|accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similarity to wind turbines ==
Tidal stream generators draw energy from water currents in much the same way as [[wind turbine]]s draw energy from air currents. However, the potential for power generation by an individual tidal turbine can be greater than that of similarly rated wind energy turbine. The higher density of water relative to air (water is about 800 times the density of air) means that a single generator can provide significant power at low tidal flow velocities compared with similar wind speed.&lt;ref&gt;"Surfing Energy's New Wave" Time International 16 June 2003: 52+. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,457348,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Given that power varies with the density of medium and the cube of velocity, water speeds of nearly one-tenth the speed of wind provide the same power for the same size of turbine system; however this limits the application in practice to places where tide speed is at least 2&amp;nbsp;knots (1&amp;nbsp;m/s) even close to [[neap tide]]s. Furthermore, at higher speeds in a flow between 2 and 3&amp;nbsp;metres per second in seawater a tidal turbine can typically access four times as much energy per rotor swept area as a similarly rated power wind turbine.

== Types of tidal stream generators ==
No standard tidal stream generator has emerged as the clear winner, among a large variety of designs. Several prototypes have shown promise with many companies making bold claims, some of which are yet to be independently verified, but they have not operated commercially for extended periods to establish performances and rates of return on investments.

The [[European Marine Energy Centre]] recognizes six principal types of tidal energy converter. They are horizontal axis turbines, vertical axis turbines, oscillating hydrofoils, venturi devices, Archimedes screws and tidal kites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emec.org.uk/marine-energy/tidal-devices/&lt;/ref&gt;

The AR-1000, a 1MW turbine developed by Atlantis Resources Corporation that was successfully deployed at the EMEC facility during the summer of 2011.  The AR series are commercial scale, horizontal axis turbines designed for open ocean deployment. AR turbines feature a single rotor set with fixed pitch blades. The AR turbine is rotated as required with each tidal exchange. This is done in the slack period between tides and held in place for the optimal heading for the next tide. AR turbines are rated at 1MW @ 2.65&amp;nbsp;m/s of water flow velocity.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[File:Evopod lighter.jpg|thumb|A 3D model of an Evopod tidal turbine]]
A prototype semi-submerged floating tethered tidal turbine called [[Evopod]] has been tested since June 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceanflowenergy.com/news-details.aspx?id=6] Ocean Flow Energy Ltd announce the start of their testing in Strangford Lough&lt;/ref&gt; in Strangford Lough, [[Northern Ireland]] at 1/10 scale.

In April 2008, the Ocean Renewable Power Company, LLC (ORPC) successfully completed testing its proprietary turbine-generator unit (TGU) prototype at ORPC's [[Cobscook Bay]] and [[Western Passage]] tidal sites near [[Eastport, Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2008/07/28/weekly9-Tide-is-slowly-rising-in-interest-in-ocean-power.html/ | title=Tide is slowly rising in interest in ocean power | publisher=Mass High Tech: The Journal of New England Technology | date=August 1, 2008 | accessdate=2008-10-11 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226061813/http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2008/07/28/weekly9-Tide-is-slowly-rising-in-interest-in-ocean-power.html/ | archivedate=December 26, 2008 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The TGU is the core of the OCGen technology and uses advanced design cross-flow (ADCF) turbines to drive a permanent magnet generator located between the turbines and mounted on the same shaft. ORPC has developed TGU designs that can be used for generating power from river, tidal and deep water ocean currents.

Trials in the [[Strait of Messina]], Italy, started in 2001 of the [[Kobold turbine]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpa.unina.it/adag/eng/renewable_energy.html A.D.A.Group] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325101125/http://www.dpa.unina.it/adag/eng/renewable_energy.html |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flow augmented turbines ===

[[File:Sea Bed Turbine.png|thumb|A shrouded turbine]]

Using flow augmentation measures, for example a duct or shroud, the incident power available to a turbine can be increased. The most common example uses a [[Shrouded tidal turbine|shroud]] to increase the flow rate through the turbine, which can be either axial or crossflow.

The Australian company Tidal Energy Pty Ltd undertook successful commercial trials of efficient [[shrouded tidal turbine]]s on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]] in 2002. Tidal Energy delivered their shrouded turbine in northern Australia where some of the fastest recorded flows (11&amp;nbsp;m/s, 21&amp;nbsp;knots) are found. Two small turbines will provide 3.5&amp;nbsp;MW. Another larger 5&amp;nbsp;meter diameter turbine, capable of 800&amp;nbsp;kW in 4&amp;nbsp;m/s of flow, was planned as a tidal powered desalination showcase near Brisbane Australia.

=== Oscillating devices ===
Oscillating devices do not have a rotating component, instead making use of [[aerofoil]] sections which are pushed sideways by the flow. Oscillating stream power extraction was proven with the omni- or bi-directional Wing'd Pump windmill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econologica.org/watermill.htm |title=Wing'd Pump Windmill |publisher=Econologica.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2003 a 150&amp;nbsp;kW oscillating hydroplane device, the Stingray, was tested off the Scottish coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engb.com/ |title=Stingray |publisher=Engb.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Stingray uses hydrofoils to create oscillation, which allows it to create hydraulic power. This hydraulic power is then used to power a hydraulic motor, which then turns a generator.&lt;ref name="ASAP. Web. 8 October 2009"/&gt;

Pulse Tidal operate an oscillating hydrofoil device in the [[Humber Estuary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z07OV0d9NS4 |title=BBC Look North "A tidal power project in the Humber has generated its first batch of electricity" |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2009-08-06 |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having secured funding from the EU, they are developing a commercial scale device to be commissioned 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Don Pratt |url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/pulse-tidal-receives-eu-grant/1000213.article |title=EU Grant reported by The Engineer |publisher=Theengineer.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bioSTREAM tidal power conversion system, uses the [[biomimicry]] of swimming species, such as shark, tuna, and mackerel using their highly efficient [[Thunniform]] mode propulsion. It is produced by Australian company BioPower Systems.

A 2&amp;nbsp;kW prototype relying on the use of two oscillating hydrofoils in a tandem configuration has been developed at Laval University and tested successfully near Quebec City, Canada, in 2009. A hydrodynamic efficiency of 40% has been achieved during the field tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hydrolienne.fsg.ulaval.ca/en |title=HAO turbine |publisher=Hydrolienne.fsg.ulaval.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Venturi effect ===
{{See also|Venturi effect}}

Venturi effect devices use a shroud or duct in order to generate a pressure differential which is used to run a secondary hydraulic circuit which is used to generate power. A device, the Hydro Venturi, is to be tested in San Francisco Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Seth Wolf |url=http://www.sfbg.com/38/43/news_tidal.html |title=San Francisco Bay Guardian News |publisher=Sfbg.com |date=2004-07-27 |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tidal kite turbines===
A '''tidal kite turbine''' is an underwater kite system or [[Paravane (water kite)|paravane]] that converts [[tidal energy]] into electricity by moving through the tidal stream. An estimated 1% of 2011's global energy requirements could be provided by such devices at scale.&lt;ref name=g1103&gt;{{cite web|last=Carrington |first=Damian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/mar/02/underwater-kite-turbine-green-electricity |title=Underwater kite-turbine may turn tides into green electricity &amp;#124; Damian Carrington &amp;#124; Environment |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2011-03-02 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;History
Ernst Souczek of Vienna, Austria, on August 6, 1947, filed for a patent [https://www.google.com/patents/US2501696 US2501696]; assignor of one-half to Wolfgang Kmentt, also of Vienna.  Their water kite turbine disclosure demonstrated a rich art in water-kite turbines. In similar technology, many others prior to 2006 advanced water-kite and paravane electric generating systems. In 2006, a tidal kite turbine was developed by Swedish company Minesto. They conducted its first sea trial in Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland in the summer of 2011. The test used kites with wingspan of 1.4m.&lt;ref name=g1103/&gt; 
In 2013 the Deep Green pilot plant began operation off Northern Ireland. The plant uses [[carbon fiber]] kites with a wingspan of 8m (or 12m&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news192784124.html |title=Deep Green underwater kite to generate electricity (w/ Video) |publisher=Phys.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Each kite has a rated power of 120 kilowatts at a tidal flow of 1.3 meters per second.&lt;ref name=iee1311&gt;{{cite web|last=Tweed |first=Katherine |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/green-tech/geothermal-and-tidal/underwater-kite-harvests-energy-from-slow-currents |title=Underwater Kite Harvests Energy From Slow Currents - IEEE Spectrum |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |date=2013-11-14 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Design
Minesto's kite has a wingspan of {{convert|8|-|14|m}}.  The kite has neutral buoyancy, so doesn't sink as the tide turns from ebb to flow. Each kite is equipped with a gearless [[turbine]] to generate which is transmitted by the attachment cable to a transformer and then to the electricity grid. The turbine mouth is protected to protect marine life.&lt;ref name=g1103/&gt;
The 14-meter version has a rated power of 850 kilowatts at 1.7 meters per second.&lt;ref name=iee1311/&gt;
;Operation
The kite is tethered by a cable to a fixed point. It "flies" through the current carrying a turbine. It moves in a [[figure-eight loop]] to increase the speed of the water flowing through the turbine tenfold. [[Force]] increases with the cube of [[velocity]], offering the potential to generate 1,000-fold more energy than a stationary generator.&lt;ref name=g1103/&gt;
That maneuver means the kite can operate in tidal streams that move too slowly to drive earlier tidal devices, such as the [[SeaGen]] turbine.&lt;ref name=g1103/&gt;
The kite was expected to work in flows as low {{convert|1|-|2.5|m}} per second, while first-generation devices need over 2.5s. Each kite will have a capacity to generate between 150 and 800&amp;nbsp;kW. They can be deployed in waters {{convert|50|-|300|m}} deep.&lt;ref name=g1103/&gt;

== Tidal stream developers ==
There are a number of individuals and companies developing tidal energy converters across the world. A database of all know tidal energy developers is kept up-to-date here: [http://www.emec.org.uk/marine-energy/tidal-developers/ Tidal energy developers]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emec.org.uk/marine-energy/tidal-developers/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tidal stream testing ==
The world's first marine energy test facility was established in 2003 to kick start the development of the wave and tidal energy industry in the UK. Based in Orkney, Scotland, the [http://www.emec.org.uk/ European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC)] has supported the deployment of more wave and tidal energy devices than at any other single site in the world. EMEC provides a variety of test sites in real sea conditions. Its grid connected tidal test site is located at the Fall of Warness, off the island of Eday, in a narrow channel which concentrates the tide as it flows between the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea. This area has a very strong tidal current, which can travel up to 4&amp;nbsp;m/s (8 knots) in spring tides. Tidal energy developers currently testing at the site include Alstom (formerly Tidal Generation Ltd), ANDRITZ HYDRO Hammerfest, OpenHydro, Scotrenewables Tidal Power, and Voith.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emec.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, British company Lunar Energy announced that, in conjunction with [[E.ON]], they would be building the world's first deep-sea tidal energy farm off the coast of Pembrokshire in Wales. It will provide electricity for 5,000 homes.
Eight underwater turbines, each 25&amp;nbsp;metres long and 15&amp;nbsp;metres high, are to be installed on the sea bottom off St David's peninsula. Construction is due to start in the summer of 2008 and the proposed tidal energy turbines, described as "a wind farm under the sea", should be operational by 2010.{{update after|2010|12|31}}

[[Alderney Renewable Energy Ltd]] was granted a licence in 2008 and is planning to use tidal turbines to extract power from the notoriously strong [[tidal race]]s around [[Alderney]] in the [[Channel Islands]]. It is estimated that up to 3&amp;nbsp;GW could be extracted. This would not only supply the island's needs but also leave a considerable surplus for export,&lt;ref name="arel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.are.gb.com/index.php |title=Alderney Renewable Energy Ltd |publisher=Are.gb.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a [[Channel Islands Electricity Grid|France-Alderney-Britain cable]] (FAB Link) which is expected to go online by 2020.

[[Nova Scotia Power]] has selected OpenHydro's turbine for a tidal energy demonstration project in the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, Canada and Alderney Renewable Energy Ltd for the supply of tidal turbines in the Channel Islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openhydro.com Open Hydro]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pulse Tidal]] are designing a commercial device{{when|date=April 2013}} with seven other companies who are expert in their fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulsegeneration.co.uk/?q=node/54 Pulse Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt; The consortium was awarded an €8 million EU grant to develop the first device, which will be deployed in 2012{{where?|date=April 2013}} and generate enough power for 1,000 homes.

[[ScottishPower Renewables]] are planning to deploy ten 1MW HS1000 devices designed by [[Hammerfest Strom]] in the [[Sound of Islay]].{{when|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islayenergytrust.org.uk Islay Energy Trust]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Committee]] (FERC) approved a pilot license for Snohomish County PUD to install two [[OpenHydro]] tidal turbines in [[Admiralty Inlet]], WA. This project is the first grid-connected two-turbine project in the US; installation is planned for the summer of 2015.  The OpenHydro tidal turbines that [[Snohomish County]] PUD will use are designed to be placed directly into the seafloor at a depth of roughly 200 feet, so that there will be no effect on commercial navigation overhead.  The license granted by the FERC also includes plans to protect fish, wildlife, as well as cultural and aesthetic resources, in addition to navigation.  Each turbine measures 6 meters in diameter, and will generate up to 300&amp;nbsp;kW of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;http://tethys.pnnl.gov/blog/admiralty-inlet-pilot-tidal-project&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, the project was canceled due to cost concerns. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/snohomish-county-pud-drops-tidal-energy-project/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy calculations ==

=== Turbine power ===
Tidal energy converters can have varying modes of operating and therefore varying power output. If the power coefficient of the device "&lt;math&gt; C_P&lt;/math&gt;" is known, the equation below can be used to determine the power output of the hydrodynamic subsystem of the machine. This available power cannot exceed that imposed by the [[Betz limit]] on the power coefficient, although this can be circumvented to some degree by placing a [[Shrouded tidal turbine|turbine in a shroud or duct]]. This works, in essence, by forcing water which would not have flowed through the turbine through the rotor disk. In these situations it is the frontal area of the duct, rather than the turbine, which is used in calculating the power coefficient and therefore the Betz limit still applies to the device as a whole.

The energy available from these kinetic systems can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{\rho A V^3}{2} C_P&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt; C_P&lt;/math&gt; = the turbine power coefficient
:''P'' = the power generated (in watts)
:&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; = the density of the water (seawater is 1027 kg/m³)
:''A'' = the sweep area of the turbine (in m²)
:''V'' = the velocity of the flow

Relative to an open turbine in free stream, ducted turbines are capable of as much as 3 to 4 times the power of the same turbine rotor in open flow.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberiad.net/library/pdf/bk_tidal_paper25apr06.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913202219/http://www.cyberiad.net/library/pdf/bk_tidal_paper25apr06.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-13 |df= }} tidal paper on cyberiad.net&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resource assessment ===
While initial assessments of the available energy in a channel have focus on calculations using the kinetic energy flux model, the limitations of tidal power generation are significantly more complicated. For example, the maximum physical possible energy extraction from a strait connecting two large basins is given to within 10% by:&lt;ref&gt;Atwater, J.F., Lawrence, G.A. (2008) Limitations on Tidal Power Generation in a Channel, Proceedings of the 10th World Renewable Energy Congress. (pp 947–952)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, C. and Cummins, P. (2005). "The power potential of tidal currents in channels." Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, Vol. 461, London. The Royal Society, 2563–2572&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; P = 0.22\, \rho\, g\, \Delta H_\text{max}\, Q_\text{max}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; = the density of the water (seawater is 1027 kg/m³)
:''g'' = gravitational acceleration (9.80665 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H_\text{max}&lt;/math&gt; = maximum differential water surface elevation across the channel
:&lt;math&gt;Q_\text{max}&lt;/math&gt;= maximum volumetric flow rate though the channel.

== Potential sites ==
As with wind power, selection of location is critical for the tidal turbine. Tidal stream systems need to be located in areas with fast currents where natural flows are concentrated between obstructions, for example at the entrances to bays and rivers, around rocky points, headlands, or between islands or other land masses. The following potential sites are under serious consideration:

Modern advances in [[turbine]] technology may eventually see large amounts of power generated from the ocean, especially tidal currents using the tidal stream designs but also from the major thermal current systems such as the [[Gulf Stream]], which is covered by the more general term [[marine current power]]. Tidal stream turbines may be arrayed in high-velocity areas where natural tidal current flows are concentrated such as the west and east coasts of Canada, the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], the [[Bosporus]], and numerous sites in [[Southeast Asia]] and Australia. Such flows occur almost anywhere where there are entrances to bays and rivers, or between land masses where water currents are concentrated.

== Environmental impacts ==

The main environmental concern with [[tidal energy]] is associated with blade strike and entanglement of marine organisms as high speed water increases the risk of organisms being pushed near or through these devices. As with all offshore renewable energies, there is also a concern about how the creation of EMF and acoustic outputs may affect marine organisms. It should be noted that because these devices are in the water, the acoustic output can be greater than those created with [[offshore wind energy]]. Depending on the frequency and amplitude of sound generated by the tidal energy devices, this acoustic output can have varying effects on marine mammals (particularly those who echolocate to communicate and navigate in the marine environment such as [[dolphin]]s and [[whale]]s). Tidal energy removal can also cause environmental concerns such as degrading farfield water quality and disrupting sediment processes. Depending on the size of the project, these effects can range from small traces of sediment build up near the tidal device to severely affecting nearshore ecosystems and processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tethys|url=http://tethys.pnnl.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study of the Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy (RITE, Verdant Power) project in the East River (New York City), used 24 split beam hydroacoustic sensors ([[scientific echosounder]]) to detect and track the movement of fish both upstream and downstream of each of six turbines. The results suggested (1) very few fish using this portion of the river, (2) those fish which did use this area were not using the portion of the river which would subject them to blade strikes, and (3) no evidence of fish traveling through blade areas. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Work is currently being conducted by the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center ([[NNMREC]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/nnmrec/]&lt;/ref&gt;)to explore and establish tools and protocols for assessment of physical and biological conditions and monitor environmental changes associated with tidal energy development.

[[File:Floating_runway.jpeg|350px|thumb|right| [[Mobile offshore base]] ]]

'''Very large floating structures''' ('''VLFSs''') or '''very large floating platforms (VLFPs)''' are manmade islands, which may be constructed to create [[floating airport]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]], [[pier]]s and [[Dock (maritime)|dock]]s, storage facilities (for oil &amp; natural gas), [[Floating wind turbine|wind]] and [[Tata Power#Future projects|solar]] power plants, for [[Sea-based X-band Radar|military purposes]]&lt;!-- example only; there may possibly be a more general article on large military floating structures? or not. --&gt;, to create industrial space, emergency bases, entertainment facilities (such as [[casino]]s), recreation parks, [[Oil platform|mobile offshore structures]] and even for [[Seasteading|habitation]]. Currently, several different concepts have been proposed for building [[Ocean colonization|floating cities]] or huge living complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deltasync.nl/deltasync/index.php?id=1&amp;L=1|title=DeltaSync floating city|publisher=Deltasync.nl|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some units have been constructed and are presently in operation.&lt;ref&gt;Japan constructed the Mega-Float (a floating runway in Tokyo bay); Japan also has floating fuel storage bases at Shirashima and Kamigoto Islands, and floating ferry piers at Ujina port (Hiroshima). Several very long floating bridges are currently in use; three are located near Seattle, Washington USA. The [[Floating Bridge, Dubai]], over the Dubai Creek, is 300 meters long. Singapore built the world’s largest floating performance stage at the Marina Bay, and is currently installing a mega floating fuel storage facility off Pulau Sebarok. South Korea is currently installing three floating islands on the Han River, to be used for convention centers, and another project at Seoul will function as hotel/convention center/customs site/quay. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705811010848 Science Direct, ''Very Large Floating Structures'', p. 63]&lt;/ref&gt;

Floating structures offer several advantages over more permanent structures which might extend from the shore into open water:
*they do not damage the marine eco-system;
*they do not cause silt deposition in deep harbors;
*they do not disrupt the ocean currents;
*they are easy to construct, since much of the construction is completed onshore;
*installation is rapid;
*they are immune to seismic shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705811010848 | doi=10.1016/j.proeng.2011.07.007 | volume=14 | title=Very Large Floating Structures: Applications, Research and Development | year=2011 | journal=Procedia Engineering | pages=62–72 | last1 = Wang | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Tay | first2 = Z.Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
VLFS differ from watercraft in that the usable area is the top surface instead of the internal (hold) areas. Thus a useful VLFS will cover significant area. It can be constructed by joining the necessary number of floating units together. The design of the floating structure must comport with safety and strength requirements, operating conditions, etc. Steel, [[Offshore concrete structure#Floating structures|concrete (prestressed or reinforced hybrid) or steel-concrete composite materials]] may be used to build the floating structure. The motion of the floating structure due to wind or wave action must be substantially neutralized, to ensure the safety of people and facilities on a VLFS, and to allow useful activities. VLFS must be securely moored to the ocean bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705811010848 | doi=10.1016/j.proeng.2011.07.007 | volume=14 | title=Very Large Floating Structures: Applications, Research and Development | year=2011 | journal=Procedia Engineering | pages=62–72 | last1 = Wang | first1 = C.M. | last2 = Tay | first2 = Z.Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Current designs for VLFS fall into two categories: [[semi-submersible]], and [[Pontoon bridge|pontoon]].

The semi-submersible-type VLFS has a raised platform above sea level using column tubes; it is more suitable for deployment in high seas with large waves. In open sea, where the waves are relatively large, the semi-submersible VLFS minimizes the effects of waves while maintaining a constant buoyant force. Semi-submersible types are used for [[petroleum]] exploration in deep waters. They are fixed in place by column tubes, piles, or other bracing systems.

The pontoon-type VLFS platform rests on the water surface and is intended for deployment in calm waters such as a cove, a lagoon or a harbor. Its basic element is a simple box structure; it usually offers high stability, low manufacturing cost and easy maintenance and repair. The pontoon type is supported by its buoyancy on the sea surface. The pontoon type is flexible compared to other kinds of offshore structures, so that the elastic deformations are more important than their rigid body motions. Thus, hydroelastic analysis is uppermost in designing the pontoon-type VLFS. Together with the motion of the floating structure, the response of the structure to water waves and the impact on the entire fluid domain have to be studied.

== VLFS types ==

Pontoon-type VLFS are also known in the literature as mat-like VLFS because of their small draft in relation to the length dimensions. {{anchor|Mega-Float}}Very large pontoon-type floating structures are often called ''Mega-Floats''. As a rule, the Mega-Float is a floating structure having at least one length dimension greater than 60 meters. Horizontally large floating structures can be from 500 to 5000 meters in length and 100 to 1000 meters in width, with typical thickness of 2 to 10 meters.

Air-cushion supported Mega-Floaters are mega floaters that are supported by an air cushion. They were invented by Jan Van Kessel of TU Delft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delta.tudelft.nl/nl/archief/artikel/shoebox-at-sea/20630|title=Jan Van Kessel's mega-floater design|publisher=Delta.tudelft.nl|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Many large floating structures have been conceptualized, including a [[golf course]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kiniry|first1=Laura|title=9 of the World's Weirdest Floating Structures: floating golf course|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/architecture/9-of-the-worlds-weirdest-floating-structures#slide-3|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
a [[farm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kiniry|first1=Laura|title=9 of the World's Weirdest Floating Structures: floating farm|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/architecture/9-of-the-worlds-weirdest-floating-structures#slide-5|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and habitable long-term living complexes ([[seasteading]]).

Some large floating structures that have been built include floating airports and floating landing platforms for returning rockets.

===Floating airport===
{{asof|2002}}, the largest offshore structure built is the ''Mega-Float'', a [[floating airport]] prototype that was constructed in Tokyo Bay from 1998 to 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.build.new-atlantis.org/vlfs.htm Very large floating structure — Mega-Float, completed 1999]. New Atlantis 2002, retrieved 1 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is one kilometer in length, and was primarily intended as a test vehicle, to research the loadings and responses of such installations.&lt;ref&gt;Areas being studied in Mega-Float include the hydroelastic behavior of the unit, the mooring system response and durability, the connector system and its welded joints, the anti-corrosion system, the unit's effect on the surrounding seawaves which impact the nearby shoreline, and the unit's effect on the bay's prevailing currents, water quality and marine ecosystems.&lt;/ref&gt; This project was substituted as a study project to provide more definite information about a proposed floating runway at [[Kansai International Airport]], which was not built (an artificial island was instead constructed to support the runway).

===Floating landing platforms===
In the 2010s, [[Space Exploration Technologies]] (SpaceX) contracted with a [[Louisiana]] [[shipyard]] to build a floating landing platform for [[reusable launch vehicle|reusable]] [[orbital spaceflight|orbital]] [[launch vehicle]]s. The platform had an approximately {{convert|90|x|50|m|sp=us}} landing pad surface and was capable of precision [[Dynamic positioning|positioning]] with [[Diesel engine|diesel-powered]] [[azimuth thruster]]s&lt;ref name=tm20141122&gt;{{cite web|title=SpaceX Announces Spaceport Barge Positioned by Thrustmaster’s Thrusters|url=http://www.thrustmaster.net/spacex-announces-spaceport-barge-positioned-thrustmasters-thrusters/|publisher=Thrustmaster|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=22 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207091326/http://www.thrustmaster.net/out-drive-propulsion-unit/portable-dynamic-positioning-system/|archivedate=7 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the platform can hold its position for launch vehicle landing.

SpaceX CEO [[Elon Musk]] first displayed a photograph of the "[[autonomous spaceport drone ship]]" in November 2014. The ship is designed to hold position to within {{convert|3|m|sp=us}}, even under storm conditions.&lt;ref name=musk20141122&gt;{{cite web|last1=Musk|first1=Elon|title=Autonomous spaceport drone ship|url=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/536262624653365248|publisher=SpaceX|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April 2016, the first stage of the rocket that launched the [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]] [[SpaceX CRS-8|CRS-8]] spacecraft, successfully landed on the drone ship named ''Of Course I Still Love You,'' the first successful landing of a rocket booster on a floating platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/08/spacex-rocket-makes-spectacular-landing-on-drone-ship/ |title=SpaceX Rocket Makes Spectacular Landing on Drone Ship |website=Phenomena |access-date=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2018}}, [[Blue Origin]] is intending to make the first stage boosters of [[New Glenn]] be [[reusable launch vehicle|reusable]], and recover launched boosters downrange on the [[Atlantic Ocean]] via a [[Blue Origin landing platform ship|ship that is underway]] acting as a [[floating landing platform|floating movable landing platform]].

The '''Wartberg culture''' ({{lang-de|Wartbergkultur}}), sometimes: '''Wartberg group''' (''Wartberggruppe'') or '''Collared bottle culture''' (''Kragenflaschenkultur'') is a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] [[Archaeological culture|culture]] from 3,600 -2,800 BC of the later [[Central Europe]]an [[Neolithic]]. It is named after its [[type site]], the Wartberg, a hill (306m [[Above mean sea level|asl]]) near [[Niedenstein]]-Kirchberg in northern [[Hesse]], [[Germany]].

==Distribution==
[[File:Wartberg near kirchberg.JPG|right|thumb|200px|The Wartberg near Kirchberg]]
The Wartberg culture is currently known to have a distribution in northern Hesse, southern [[Lower Saxony]] and western [[Thuringia]]; a southern extent as far as the [[Rhein-Main Region]] is possible, but not definitely proven at this point.&lt;ref&gt;Raetzel-Fabian 1990, 112, 121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dates==
The term Wartberg culture describes a group of sites with similar characteristic finds from circa 3600-2800 BC. The Wartberg culture appears to be a regional development derived from [[Michelsberg culture|Michelsberg]] and [[Baalberge culture]] antecedents. It is contemporary, and in contact, with Bernburg culture and [[Funnelbeaker culture|Funnel Beaker (TRB)]]. The [[Corded ware culture|Corded Ware and Single Grave cultures]] succeed it.&lt;ref&gt;Raetzel-Fabian 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sites==
[[File:Lohne und Hasenberg.jpg|thumb|200px|Fritzlar Plain and the Hasenberg (left) seen from the Wartberg]]

===Settlements===
Its best known sites are Wartberg, near Kirchberg,&lt;ref&gt;Schrickel 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Hasenberg, a hill near Lohne,&lt;ref&gt;Schwellnuß 1971; 1979: 21-24&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Güntersberg&lt;ref&gt;Schwellnuß 1970; 1979, 16-20&lt;/ref&gt; and Bürgel,&lt;ref&gt;Schwellnuß 1979: 24-28&lt;/ref&gt; hills near [[Gudensberg]] (all of the above are located on basalt outcrops in the fertile [[Fritzlar]] basin), and from the [[Calden]] [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] [[Enclosure (archaeology)|enclosure]].&lt;ref&gt;Raetzel Fabian 2000(b)&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all settlements identified so far are in hilltop locations: an enclosed site at Wittelsberg near [[Amöneburg]] is an exception. Virtually all the known settlements appear to have come into existence several hundred years after the development of Wartberg pottery (see below); early Wartberg settlement activity remains mostly unknown as yet.&lt;ref&gt;Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 122-3, 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Finds from the Wartberg and its sister sites included fragmented bones, mainly of [[cattle]], [[pig]], [[sheep]]/[[goat]] and [[deer]], but also of other wild animals, like [[bear]] or [[beaver]]; human bone fragments also occur in some of the settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Pinder 1878, 10-11; Schwellnuß 1970; 1971; 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the Wartberg (first excavated in the later 19th century) was interpreted as a [[cult]] place,&lt;ref&gt;Pinder 1878, 11&lt;/ref&gt; but the remains of coarse handmade pottery and of mud wall cladding do suggest settlement activity.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Schrickel 1969; Schwellnuß 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

===Megalithic tombs===
[[File:Züschen tomb1.JPG|thumb|300px|The tomb at Züschen]]
Wartberg material is also found in a number of [[gallery grave]]s (a type of [[megalithic tomb]]). Their connection with the Wartberg settlements was only recognised in the 1960s and 1970s, thus the tombs are sometimes treated separately as the Hessian-Westphalian stone cist group (''Hessisch-Westfälische Steinkistengruppe'').&lt;ref&gt;Schrickel 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

These include the tombs at [[Züschen (megalithic tomb)|Züschen]] near [[Fritzlar]], at [[Lohra (megalithic tomb)|Lohra]], at [[Naumburg, Hesse|Naumburg]]-[[Altendorf (megalithic tomb)|Altendorf]], at [[Hadamar]]-Niederzeuzheim (now rebuilt in a park at [[Hachenburg]]), at [[Beselich]]-[[Niedertiefenbach (megalithic tomb)|Niedertiefenbach]], at [[Warburg]], Rimbeck and at Grossenrode, as well as two tombs near the Calden enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel 1990, 162-166; Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 112-129&lt;/ref&gt; A tomb at Muschenheim near [[Münzenberg]] may also belong to the same type,&lt;ref&gt;M. Menke, "Neue Ausgrabungen in der Magalithanlage 'Heilige Steine' bei Muschenheim (Lkr. Gießen): Vorbericht über die Ausgrabungskampagnen 1989 bis 1992" in: ''Germania'' 71/2, 1993, p. 279-314&lt;/ref&gt; as may a further one at [[Bad Vilbel]] near [[Frankfurt am Main]] which was destroyed after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;K. Fritz: Nachlese zum Vortrag "Das Verschollene Hünengrab vom Heilsberg". in: ''Heilsberger Nachrichten, Mitteilungsblatt des Bürgervereins Heilsberg e.v. (Bad Vilbel)'', 48/28, 1998, p. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;
The best known of these tombs are those of Züschen, Lohra, Niederzeuzzheim and Altendorf. They normally contained the [[inhumation|inhumed]] remains of multiple individuals (the Altendorf tomb contained at least 250 people) of all ages and both sexes. Lohra is an exception insofar as there the dead were [[cremation|cremated]]. Gravegoods are scarce but include pottery (collared bottles), stone tools and animal bones, especially the jawbones of foxes, which may have played a [[totem]]ic role. The Züschen tomb is also remarkable for the presence of [[rock art]].&lt;ref&gt;Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 123-129&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the tombs can be directly associated with nearby hilltop sites or settlements,&lt;ref&gt;Schwellnuß 1979, 57-60&lt;/ref&gt; that is, the Züschen tomb with the Hasenberg and the Calden tombs with the earthwork. According to the German [[archaeologist]] Waltraud Schrickel, the association with gallery graves suggests a west European influence, perhaps from the [[Paris Basin]] in [[France]], where very similar tombs occur.&lt;ref&gt;Schrickel 1966&lt;/ref&gt; The Wartberg tombs appear to start developing around 3400 BC, earlier than most of the known settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standing stones===
A loose distribution of [[standing stone]]s occurs in northern Hesse and west Thuringia. Although their dates are unknown, their geographic spread appears to coincide with that of Wartberg material, perhaps suggesting a connection.&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel 1990, 170-173; Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 136-148&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enclosures===
The Calden earthwork, a large enclosure northwest of modern [[Kassel]], was built around 3700 BC. It is an irregular enclosure of two ditches and a palisade, encompassing an area of 14 hectares. The enclosure has five openings, perhaps comparable to [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Causewayed enclosure]]s. Although it can with some certainty be seen as derived from the [[Michelsberg culture|Michelsberg]] tradition, material associated with its early phases suggests a close connection with early Wartberg. It appears to have been a tradition for several centuries to bury animal bones (food refuse?) and broken pots in pits dug into the partially filled-in earthwork ditches. The ditches also contain the remains of many human inhumations. This activity continued until circa 2000 BC and was particularly intensive during the Wartberg period. Two nearby graves postdate the earthwork by several centuries, but coincide with that activity. While the original function of the earthwork is not necessarily explained by these finds, it appears likely that at least during later phases of its use it had a [[ritual]] significance, perhaps connected with a cult of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Raetzel-Fabian 2000(b)&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, the enclosure around the settlement at Wittelsberg appears to be simply protective/defensive in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Fielder 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finds==
[[File:Wartberg bottles.JPG|left|thumb|150px|Collared bottles from the Züschen tomb]]
[[File:Wartberg pottery.JPG|thumb|250px|Typical Wartberg pots in Kassel museum]]

===Pottery===
Wartberg pottery is handmade and mostly very coarse. Typical shapes in the mid-4th millennium include saucepans with inturned rim and deep incisions, cups with strap handles, collared bottles (''Kragenflaschen''). The presence of pottery with deeply incised patterns as well as of clay drums suggest connections with the [[Funnelbeaker culture|Funnel Beaker culture (TRB)]] of Central Germany.
 
In the later Wartberg, strap-handled cups, funnel beakers, varied bowls, large pots with holes below the rim and collared bottles occur. The frequent presence of collared bottles, not least in the tombs, is of special interest. The bottles are made with somewhat more care than other vessels; their very specific shape suggests a special function, often suggested to be connected with the storage of special material, like vegetable oil or sulphur, perhaps for healing purposes.&lt;ref&gt;For whole pottery section: Raetzel Fabian 2000, 122, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stone and bone tools ===
Slate axes are very common, slate blades also occur. The Wartberg culture produced fine stone arrowheads with well defined tangs and "wings".
A variety of bone tools, mainly points, has been found both in tombs and settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Raetzel-Fabian, 2000, 132&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Little can be said about the economy of the Wartberg group. The location of sites and certain finds suggest a broadly [[sedentism|sedentary]] society susbsisting from [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]], but [[hunting]] may play a considerable economic role. The Wartberg area appears to be in general trade contact with its neighbouring regions.

==Social aspects==
The presence of earthworks and of collective tombs indicates different levels of collective effort, thus implying a considerable degree of social organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Wartberg material is on display at the following museums:

[[File:Wassermotor-mit Pfeilen.gif|thumb|Animation, based on ''Lexikon der gesamten Technik'' (1904)]]
The '''water engine''' is a positive-displacement engine, often closely resembling a [[steam engine]] with similar pistons and valves, that is driven by [[pressure#Fluid pressure|water pressure]]. The supply of water was derived from a [[hydraulic head|natural head of water]], the [[water supply network|water mains]], or a specialised high-pressure water supply such as that provided by the [[London Hydraulic Power Company]]. Water mains in the 19th century often operated at pressures of 30 to 40 [[pounds per square inch|psi]], while hydraulic power companies supplied higher pressure water at anything up to 800 psi.

The term '''water motor'''  ({{lang-de|Wassermotor}}) was more commonly applied to small [[Pelton wheel]] type turbines driven from a mains water tap (e.g. [[Whitney (City Road, London)|Whitney Water Motor]]), and mainly used for light loads, for example sewing machines.

In the nineteenth century, the terms ''[[hydraulic motor]]'' and ''hydraulic engine'' often implied reference to any motor driven by liquid pressure, including water motors and water engines used in [[hydropower]], but today mentions of hydraulic motors, unless otherwise specified, usually refer more specifically to those that run on hydraulic fluid in the closed hydraulic circuits of [[hydraulic machinery]].

==Description==
Because water is incompressible, the valve gear of water engines is more complicated than that used in steam engines, and some water engines even had a small secondary engine solely to power the operation of their valves. Closing a valve too quickly can cause very large pressures to result, and pipework to explode (a phenomenon similar to [[water hammer]]), and in addition to valves designed to close slowly, many water engines used air chambers to provide some absorption of force by compressing the air in them.

==History==
[[File:L-Wassermotor4.png|thumb|Detailed cross-section from ''Lexikon der gesamten Technik'' (1904)]]
It is unclear when or where water engines were invented, but it is possible that they were first used in the mines in central Germany; certainly such a device was described by [[Robert Fludd]] after he had visited Germany around 1600.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  The original diagram and description of Fludd's water-powered pump appears in:  Robert Fludd, ''Tractus secundus de Naturae Simia Seu Technica Macrocosmi Historia'' … (Oppenheim, (Germany):  Johann-Theodore de Fry, 1618), part VII, book II, chapter X, [https://books.google.de/books?id=UW49qsPxOVcC&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA467#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 467-468].
*  A diagram and English explanation of Fludd's pump is available in:   Thomas Ewbank, ''A Descriptive and Historical Account of Hydraulic and Other Machines for Raising Water'', … , 2nd ed. (New York, New York:  Greeley &amp; McElrath, 1847), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0_o0AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA354#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 354-355].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/POWER/waterengine/waterengine.htm The Fludd Pump] at douglas-self.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
During the 19th century water engines were extensively used in the city of London, operating on high-pressure water supplied by the London Hydraulic Power Company via its extensive network of pipes. Even when practical electric motors entered use, water engines remained popular for some years as they possessed several advantages: they were quiet, reliable, cheap to run, compact, safe, and could be relied on to operate reliably in damp or waterlogged conditions unsuited to electrical apparatus, such as powering water pumps in mines, where their ability to continue operating even while completely submerged was a major advantage.

Other applications included usage by the railway companies, where they powered [[Turntable (rail)|railway turntables]], cranes, hoists, etc., revolving stages at the [[London Palladium]] and [[Coliseum Theatre]], and powering [[pipe organ]]s.

== Water-column engines ==
The largest possible design of a water engine is the directly acting '''water-column engine''' or '''water column machine'''&lt;ref&gt;Ernst, Dr.-Ing. Richard (1989). ''Wörterbuch der Industriellen Technik'' (5th ed.). Wiesbaden: Oscar Brandstetter, 1989. {{ISBN|3-87097-145-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (German: ''Wassersäulenmaschine''). Such devices had been in use for pumping purposes in different mining areas since the middle of the eighteenth century and one was used, for example, by [[Georg Friedrich von Reichenbach]] in 1810 to pump brine from Berchtesgaden to Reichenhall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/tandf/reichenbach-georg-friedrich-von-tf/ ''Reichenbach, Georg Friedrich von'', Biographical Dictionary of the History of Technology at www.bookrags.com. Retrieved on 29 Oct 09]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Similar to the function of a  [[hydraulic ram]] the water being admitted is transported by another medium. The differently-sized pistons of the water-column engine run on a single axle; its control loosely resembles that of a [[steam engine]]. Water-column engines were used in the transportation of [[brine]], pumping it from one place to another.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Water engines in washing machines ==
The water engine was also successfully used in '''washing machines''', e.&amp;nbsp;g. from 1914 by the firm of [[Miele]]. These washing machines, which were very common especially in rural areas until the 1960s, comprised a wooden tub with a rotating cross built into the cover. This 'star handle' was rotated in regular, to and fro, movements by two pistons which were connected to the water mains. The washing effect was achieved by the constant movement of the washing in the washtub filled with soap suds (''Lauge'') and/or water. 

The large amount of water used was less important because plenty of used water was often available and was very cheap. In addition, in thrifty rural households the water used to drive it was often used for other purposes as well.

A prerequisite for the correct function of the water engine was sufficient pressure in the water pipes. In times of high water consumption (before or after work) the water pressure was often insufficient. In hard winters, in which the water pipes often froze, the water engine could not be used. For these reasons the washing machines still had a device that enable them to be rotated by 'muscle power'.

With the invention of the modern washing machine these washtubs with their water engines disappeared from the market.

The ensuing reaction creates a large fireball or enlarges the flame of the already existing fire incredibly. Only a small amount of wax and water is needed to create a wax fire.

==Chemistry behind the reaction==

Following the basic rules of the [[fire triangle]], for a reaction to take place three ingredients are required: [[oxygen]], fuel, and heat. In the case of wax melted down, only the top surface has access to oxygen, so the fire progresses slowly. When water is added to the wax, two things happen. Firstly, the water — being denser than wax — sinks to the bottom of the container. Secondly, as burning wax quickly reaches a temperature of well over 200 degrees C, the water instantly vapourises. When water changes from a liquid to a gas, there is more than a thousand-fold increase in volume. The water expands violently, and throws the hot wax layer above it into the air as small droplets. The wax now has a much bigger surface area exposed to oxygen so combustion takes place very quickly.

For similar reasons, water should never be used to extinguish burning grease or fat, which both behave similarly to wax. Water is ineffective at putting out other flammable liquid fires, but in most liquids (e.g. petrol), the water remains as a liquid, and spreads the fire by allowing the liquid to float and burn on top of it. One should instead use baking soda to extinguish a wax fire.

'''Wright-Hennepin Cooperative Electric Association''' (WH) is a non-profit, member-owned energy and service [[cooperative]] located in [[Rockford, Minnesota]]. The company serves more than 45,000 electric accounts in western [[Hennepin County, Minnesota]] and most of [[Wright County, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greatriverenergy.com/cooperativeway/membercooperatives/wright_hennepin.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and background==
In 1937 farmers in rural Wright and western-Hennepin counties tried to get electricity to their homes. The investor-owned utilities would not work with them because they couldn’t profitably serve the rural area, where homes and businesses were further apart and more equipment investments would need to be made.

After that rejection, the farmers joined together and created an [[electric cooperative]]. Each person who joined WH became a "member" and took one share of ownership of the cooperative. Nine members are elected to serve on the Board of Directors. They determine the cooperative's strategic direction, provide financial oversight, set electric rates, and provide other governance for the cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;Wright-Hennepin's October 2009 ''Hotline Update'' Newsletter&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ZZ dibosons''' are rare pairs of [[Z boson]]s. They were first observed by the experiments at the [[Large Electron–Positron Collider]] (ALEPH, [[DELPHI]], L3 and OPAL). The first observation in a hadron collider was made by the scientists of [[DØ experiment|DØ collaboration]] at [[Fermilab]]. They are [[force carrier|force-carrying particles]] produced in [[proton]]–[[antiproton]] collisions at the [[Tevatron]], the world’s second highest-energy [[particle accelerator]] (after the [[CERN]] [[Large Hadron Collider]]). The observation of the ZZ dibosons was announced at a Fermilab seminar on 30 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;

The rarest diboson processes after ZZ dibosons are those involving the [[Higgs boson]], so seeing ZZ diboson is an essential step in demonstrating the ability to see the Higgs boson.  ZZ dibosons are the latest in a series of observations of pairs of [[gauge bosons]] (force-carrying particles) by DØ and its sister experiment [[Collider Detector at Fermilab|CDF]] (also at Tevatron).

Final analysis of the data for this discovery was done by a team of international researchers including scientists of American, Belgian, British, Georgian, Italian, and Russian nationalities. The observations began with the study of the already-rare production of [[W boson]]s plus [[photon]]s ({{nowrap|W&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt; + &amp;gamma;}}); then Z bosons plus photons ({{nowrap|Z&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + &amp;gamma;}}); then observation of W pairs ({{nowrap|W&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt; + W&lt;sup&gt;∓&lt;/sup&gt;}}); then a mix of W and Z boson ({{nowrap|W&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt; + Z&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}}). The ZZ ({{nowrap|Z&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + Z&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;}}) is the combination which has the lowest predicted likelihood of production in the [[Standard Model]] due to the smaller couplings.
