The '''American Guide Series''' was a group of books and pamphlets published in 1937–41 under the auspices of the [[Federal Writers' Project]] (FWP), a [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era works program in the [[United States]]. The American Guide Series books were compiled by the FWP, but printed by individual states, and contained detailed histories of each of the then 48 states of the Union with descriptions of every major city and town. In total, the project employed over 6,000 writers. The format was uniform, comprising essays on the state's history and culture, descriptions of its major cities, automobile tours of important attractions, and a portfolio of photographs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/WPAStateGuides.pdf "The American Guide Series"] United States Senate. Retrieved 27 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many books in the project have been updated by private companies or republished without updating.  While not states, guides for Alaska&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/WPA-Guide-Alaska-Frontier-Digital-ebook/dp/B00G1SRBNE&lt;/ref&gt; and Puerto Rico were published, however Hawaii was not.

The '''Amistad Research Center''' ('''ARC''') is an independent archives and manuscripts repository in the United States that specializes in the history of [[African Americans]] and [[ethnic minorities]].&lt;ref name="NOOnLine"&gt;{{cite web|title=Amistad Research Center|url=http://www.neworleansonline.com/directory/location.php?locationID=1245|website=NewOrleansOnLine.com|publisher=City of New Orleans Tourism Bureau|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT1985"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clendinen|first1=Dudley|title=Archives on Black History|agency=New York Times|publisher=Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr., publisher|date=December 26, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the first institutions of its kind in the United States to collect African American ethnic historical records and to document the modern [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref name="HowardTilton"&gt;{{cite web|title=Africana Studies Research Guide|url=http://libguides.tulane.edu/african/archives|website=Howard-Tilton Memorial Library|publisher=Tulane University|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ARC has approximately 15 million holdings, emphasizing documents, and also including books, pamphlets, periodicals, photographs, and [[fine arts]].&lt;ref name="ARC1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Amistad Collections|url=http://www.amistadresearchcenter.org/collections2|website=amistadresearchcenter.org|publisher=Amistad Research Center|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It additionally has digitized holdings to enable research and education by scholars and students at locations distant from the ARC. Although the ARC documents history and race relations in the United States  its holdings extend beyond African-American history and also include the [[ethnic heritage]] of  [[Latinos]], [[Asian Americans]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[Appalachia#Ethnic groups|Appalachian whites]], and the [[LGBTQ]] community.&lt;ref name="ARC1" /&gt;

== Early history ==

=== Fisk University ===

[[File:Clifton Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|Clifton H. Johnson&lt;br /&gt;founding director]]

The ARC traces its history to the events leading to the 1841 U.S. Supreme Court case [[United States v. The Amistad]]. The [[abolitionists]] who aided the Amistad Africans in their defense in that court case eventually helped to found the [[American Missionary Association]] (AMA), as an anti-caste, integrated [[abolitionist]] group.&lt;ref name="UCC1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blacks and the American Missionary Association|url=http://www.ucc.org/about-us_hidden-histories_blacks-and-the-american|website=www.ucc.org|publisher=United Church of Christ|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During and following the [[United States Civil War]], the AMA founded hundreds of schools for the [[freedmen]] and other ethnic communities across the United States, including [[common schools]], colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="UCC1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Britanica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica|title=American Missionary Association (AMA)|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/American-Missionary-Association|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AMA became a division within the Board of Home Missions of the [[Congregational Churches]] following a 1927 merger.&lt;ref name="NCpedia"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Wiley J.|title=American Missionary Association|url=http://www.ncpedia.org/american-missionary-association|website=www.ncpedia.org|publisher=NCpedia|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to work toward causes of civil rights, race relations, and the educational work of the church throughout the mergers of the Congregation, Christian, Evangelical and Reformed churches that occurred in 1931 and in 1956.&lt;ref name="UCC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Short Course in the History of the United Church of Christ|url=http://www.ucc.org/about-us_short-course|website=ucc.org|publisher=United Church of Christ|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It  eventually fell under the umbrella of the United Church Boards of Homeland Ministries (UCBHM) of the United Church of Christ (UCC).&lt;ref name="NCpedia" /&gt;  As the AMA division's awareness of the problems of discrimination and segregation of African-Americans became evident, a two-day seminar on "racialism" was held at the Broadway Tabernacle Church in New York City in October 1941.&lt;ref name="Liberation"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=Joe M.|last2=Jones|first2=Maxine D.|title=Education for Liberation: The American Missionary Association and African Americans, 1890 to the Civil Rights Movement|date=2009|publisher=The University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa|isbn=978-0-8173-1657-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seminar was attended by AMA officers, presidents of the historically black colleges and universities, representatives of philanthropic organizations, and U.S. government officials.&lt;ref name="Liberation" /&gt; The results of the seminar was the establishment of the Race Relations Department of the UCBHM at [[Fisk University]], Nashville, Tennessee in 1942.&lt;ref name="Liberation" /&gt; The Amistad Research Center was established within the Race Relations Department to house the historical records of the American Missionary Association in 1966.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;Johnson, Clifton H. ''The Founding and Development of the Amistad Research Center,'' (Amistad Research Center: 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clifton H. Johnson]] was appointed as director of the Race Relations Department in 1966 making him the ARC's first administrator.&lt;ref name="TP1970"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff writers|title=Dillard's A.R.C. Origins Noted|agency=New Orleans Times-Picayune|publisher=David Francis, publisher|date=November 8, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was a suitable choice for the ARC because of his experience with the AMA archives.&lt;ref name="NYT1985" /&gt; He wrote his dissertation on the AMA while a [[doctoral candidate]] at the [[University of North Carolina]], organized the AMA archives, and initiated a proposal to the AMA suggesting that they use their archives as a nucleus to collect [[primary documents]] on the history of [[ethnic minorities]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="TP1970" /&gt; Johnson's initial intent for Amistad Research Center was that it would supply primary resources for scholars interested in any aspect of [[African American history]]. The UCBHM eventually closed the Race Relations Department but chose to keep the ARC and it was incorporated into an independent non-profit archive in 1969.&lt;ref name=Johnson /&gt;{{rp|page=4}}

=== Dillard University ===

After incorporation in 1969, the first meeting of the ARC's board members was held in the New York City office of the AMA.&lt;ref name=Johnson /&gt;{{rp|pages=30–31}} Dr. [[Albert W. Dent]], retired president of [[Dillard University]], approached Johnson, with an open invitation from Dr. T.S. Lawless, chairman of the university's [[board of trustees]], about moving the ARC to the campus of [[Dillard University]]. In 1970 the ARC moved to Dillard University. The university housed the ARC free of charge in its library with a promise to donate land for the construction of a permanent home on its campus. The funds for a new building at Dillard never crystallized and the Center was forced to seek a new location to house its collections that had grown beyond the space it occupied in Dillard's Library.&lt;ref name=Johnson /&gt;{{rp|pages=30–31}}

=== New Orleans Mint ===

The Amistad Research Center moved to the [[New Orleans Mint]]  in 1980 after its collection became too large for its space at Dillard University.&lt;ref name="TP1980A"&gt;{{cite news|title=Amistad Sets Events With Opening at Mint|agency=New Orleans Times-Picayune|publisher=David Francis, publisher|date=October 13, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States government had given the Old U.S. Mint building to the State of Louisiana, which in turn had given it to the [[Louisiana State Museum]]. Johnson reached agreement with the director of the museum about re-locating the ARC to the Old U.S. Mint building. The terms including renting the floor space to the ARC for $1 per year.&lt;ref name="TP1979"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barbier|first1=Sandra|title=Mint Dedication Date Tentative|agency=New Orleans Times-Picayune|publisher=David Francis, publisher|date=September 13, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ARC spent $500,000 on renovations to the new space, anticipating that the Old U.S. Mint building could accommodate its collections for the next 15 years. Johnson underestimated the growth of the ARC's collections, and after five years the ARC ran out of space again. Johnson and the ARC's Board of Trustees searched for another location that would accommodate the institution in its continued growth.&lt;ref name=Johnson /&gt;{{rp|page=31}}

=== Tulane University ===

By the mid-1980s, the ARC was in need of adequate space and invitations came from various universities to house the ARC.&lt;ref name="TP1986"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kent|first1=Joan|title=Amistad's Choice of Tulane Keeps History Center in N.O.|agency=New Orleans Times-Picayune|publisher=David Francis, publisher|date=March 18, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard University]], [[Rutgers University]], the [[University of North Carolina]], the [[University of Georgia]], [[Howard University]], [[Hampton University]], the [[University of Mississippi]], [[Tulane University]] and [[Prairie View A&amp;M]] sent delegations to make presentations to the ARC's board. There was strong opposition to both Mississippi and Tulane housing the Center because of their past histories of denying Black students admission to their schools. However, there was strong support from the local community to keep the Center in New Orleans.&lt;ref name="NYT1985" /&gt; The local chapter of the Friends of Amistad collected hundreds of signatures from Black residents in favor of Tulane.

=== Library collection ===

The ARC's library serves as a complement to the manuscripts collection and serves to document the ethnic experience in the United States by housing pamphlets, [[Street literature|broadsides]], reports, literary first and notable editions, newspapers and monographs related to its focus. The ARC contains a diverse collection of approximately 45,000 books including rare and first editions, more than 2,000 runs of [[periodicals]] dating from 1826, 1.5 million newspaper articles, and 30,000 pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;"Library," Amistad Research Center, accessed October 16, 2014, http://www.amistadresearchcenter.org/index.php/library.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to significant holdings in the area of African American literature, Amistad holds works from the personal libraries of authors [[Countee Cullen]], [[Chester Himes]], and [[Thomas Dent (writer)|Thomas Dent]] and a Comics and Graphic Novels Collection, in addition to a growing collection of [[zines]]. Of significance to the Amistad Case, the ARC's collections include [[Lewis Tappan]]'s bound volume of contemporary pamphlets on the legal proceedings with his handwritten notes. Other highlights include 18th century slave ordinances in [[French Louisiana]], an edition of [[Black Majesty]] by John W. Handercock with an unpublished handwritten poem titled "Black Majesty" by Countee Cullen on the title page verso, and Lewis Tappan's annotated copy of the 1839 edition of [[American Slavery as It Is: Testimony of a Thousand Witnesses]] by [[Theodore Dwight Weld]].&lt;ref name="LOC"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Civil Rights History Project: Survey of Collections and Repositories: The Amistad Research Center|url=https://www.loc.gov/folklife/civilrights/survey/view_repository.php?rep_id=765|website=American Folklife Project|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art collection ===

[[File:The Laundress.jpg|thumb|The Laundress, by [[Henry Ossawa Tanner]]]]

The ARC owns a significant collection of [[African American art]] consisting of approximately 400 works. Many of the artworks were a part of the collection formed by the [[William E. Harmon Foundation]] and include examples from the growing African American visual arts movement of the mid-twentieth century. The works fall within the traditional fine art categories of portraiture, landscape, and genre.&lt;ref&gt;Amistad Research Center and the New Orleans Museum of Art. ''Beyond the Blues: Reflections of African America in the Fine Arts Collection of the Amistad Research Center'', (New Orleans: New Orleans Museum of Art, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these are available in digital form.&lt;ref name="Artstor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Amistad Research Center|url=http://www.artstor.org/content/amistad-research-center|website=Artstor Digital Library|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of space limitations, the ARC's artworks are often displayed at major museums,&lt;ref name="AAArt"&gt;{{cite web|title=African-American Art|url=https://amistadresearch.wordpress.com/category/african-american-art/|website=amistadresearch.wordpress.com|publisher=Amistad Research Center|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Ogden Museum of Southern Art]], the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], the [[DuSable Museum of African American History]], [[El Museo del Barrio]], and the [[Perez Art Museum Miami]].

Among the prominent works in the collection are the 41 paintings in the [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]] series,&lt;ref name="Artstor" /&gt; completed in 1938 by [[Jacob Lawrence]] (1917–2000), a celebrated American artist of the 20th century. Toussaint was Lawrence's first series, completed when he was a 21 years old student. The paintings document the historic events of the [[Haitian Revolution]].

[[Ellis Wilson]]'s  oil painting entitled [[Funeral Procession (painting)|Funeral Procession]] is a collection highlight, especially since it was the subject of an episode of a popular television show in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="October"&gt;{{cite web|last1=October|title=Funeral Procession by Ellis Wilson|url=http://octobergallery.com/2012/05/09/funeral-procession-by-ellis-wilson/|website=octobergallery.com|publisher=October Gallery|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=July 2008}}

An '''article'''  (with the [[list of glossing abbreviations|linguistic glossing abbreviation]] {{sc|'''art'''}}) is a [[word]] that is used with a [[noun]] (as a standalone word or a [[prefix]] or [[suffix]]) to specify grammatical [[definiteness]] of the noun, and in some languages extending to volume or numerical scope.

The articles in [[English grammar]] are ''the'' and ''a/an'', and in certain contexts ''some''. [[A and an#Indefinite article|"An" and "a"]] are modern forms of the Old English "an", which in [[Anglian dialects]] was the number "one" (compare "on" in [[Saxons|Saxon dialects]]) and survived into [[Modern Scots]] as the number "owan". Both "on" (respelled "one" by the [[Norman language]]) and "an" survived into [[Modern English]], with "one" used as the number and "an" ("a", before nouns that begin with a [[consonant]] sound) as an indefinite article.

In many languages, articles are a special [[part of speech]] which {{clarify|text=cannot be easily combined |Combined by [[elision]]? Or in categories as mentioned in the next sentence, with the next sentence simply an example of this one? Citation needed. |date=June 2017}} with other parts of speech. In English grammar, [[Part of speech#English|articles]] are frequently considered part of a broader category called [[determiner]]s, which contains articles, [[demonstratives]] (such as "this" and "that"), [[possessive determiner]]s (such as "my" and "his"), and quantifiers (such as "all" and "few").&lt;ref name="YourDictionary"&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is a Determiner?|url=http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/parts-of-speech/nouns/what/what-is-a-determiner.html|website=YourDictionary|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Articles and other determiners are also sometimes counted as a type of [[adjective]], since they describe the words that they precede.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Articles—A, An, The {{!}} Scribendi.com|url=https://www.scribendi.com/advice/using_articles_a_an_the.en.html|website=Scribendi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In languages that employ articles, every [[common noun]], with some exceptions, is expressed with a certain [[definiteness]], definite or indefinite, as an [[Grammatical modifier|attribute]] (similar to the way many languages express every noun with a certain [[grammatical number]]—singular or plural—or a [[grammatical gender]]). Articles are among the most common words in many languages; in English, for example, the most frequent word is ''the''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Articles are usually categorized as either ''definite'' or ''indefinite''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definite article |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/definite-article |website=Cambridge Dictionary |accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few languages with well-developed systems of articles may distinguish additional subtypes.  Within each type, languages may have various forms of each article, due to conforming to grammatical attributes such as [[grammatical gender|gender]], [[grammatical number|number]], or [[grammatical case|case]]. Articles may also be modified as influenced by adjacent sounds or words as in [[elision]] (e.g., [[French language|French]] "le" becoming "l'" before a vowel), [[epenthesis]] (e.g., [[English language|English]] "a" becoming "an" before a vowel), or [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] (e.g. [[Irish language|Irish]] "i + na" becoming "sna").

==Definite article==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from the redirect "Definite article". If the section title changes, please update the red accordingly. --&gt;
The definite article is used to refer to a particular member of a group or class. It may be something that the speaker has already mentioned or it may be something uniquely specified. There is one definite article in English, for both singular and plural nouns: ''the'':
: '''''The children''' know '''the fastest way''' home.''
The sentence above refers to specific children and a specific way home; it contrasts with the much more general observation that:
: '''''Children''' know '''the fastest ways''' home.''
The latter sentence refers to children in general and their specific ways home.  Likewise,
: ''Give me '''the book'''.''
refers to a specific book whose identity is known or obvious to the listener; as such it has a markedly different meaning from 
: ''Give me '''a book'''.''
which uses an indefinite article, which does not specify what book is to be given.

The definite article can also be used in English to indicate a specific class among other classes:
: '''''The''' cabbage white butterfly lays its eggs on members of '''the''''' Brassica ''genus.''
However, recent developments show that definite articles are morphological elements linked to certain noun types due to [[lexicalization]]. Under this point of view, definiteness does not play a role in the selection of a definite article more than the lexical entry attached to the article.{{clarify|date=June 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Recasens, Taulé and Martí https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228748115_First-mention_definites_more_than_exceptional_cases&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diaz Collazos, Ana Maria. 2016. Definite and indefinite articles in Nikkei Spanish. In González-Rivera, Melvin, &amp; Sessarego, Sandro. New Perspectives on Hispanic Contact Linguistics in the Americas. Madrid/Frankfurt: Iberoamericana-Vervuert&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indefinite article==

&lt;!-- This section is linked from the redirect "Indefinite article". If the section title changes, please update the redirect accordingly. --&gt;
An ''indefinite'' article indicates that its noun is not a particular one identifiable to the listener. It may be something that the speaker is mentioning for the first time, or the speaker may be making a general statement about any such thing. ''a/an'' are the indefinite  articles used in English. The form ''an'' is used before words that begin with a vowel sound (even if spelled with an initial consonant, as in ''an hour''), and ''a'' before words that begin with a consonant sound (even if spelled with a vowel, as in ''a European'').

: ''She had '''a''' house so large that '''an''' elephant would get lost without '''a''' map.''

Before some words beginning with a pronounced (not silent) ''h'' in an unstressed first syllable, such as ''historic(al)'', ''hallucination'', ''hilarious'', ''horrendous'', and ''horrific'', some (especially older) British writers prefer to use ''an'' over ''a'' (''an historical event'', etc.).&lt;ref name="New Oxford"&gt;New Oxford Dictionary of English, 1999, usage note for ''an'': "There is still some divergence of opinion over the form of the indefinite article to use preceding certain words beginning with '''h'''- when the first syllable is unstressed:  ‘'''a''' historical document’ or ‘'''an''' historical document’; ‘'''a''' hotel’ or ‘'''an'''  hotel’. The form depends on whether the initial h is sounded or not: '''an''' was common in the 18th and 19th centuries, because the initial h was commonly not pronounced for these words. In standard modern English the norm is for the '''h''' to be pronounced in words like '''hotel''' and '''historical''', and therefore the indefinite article '''a''' is used; however, the older form, with the silent '''h''' and the indefinite article '''an''', is still encountered, especially among older speakers."&lt;/ref&gt;  ''An'' is also preferred before ''hotel'' by some writers of British English (probably reflecting the relatively recent adoption of the word from French, in which the ''h'' is not pronounced).&lt;ref name=Peterspg1&gt;[[Brown Corpus]] and [[Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen Corpus]], quoted in Peters (2004: 1)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "an" before words beginning with an unstressed "h" is more common generally in British English than in American.&lt;ref name=Peterspg1/&gt; American writers normally use ''a'' in all these cases, although there are occasional uses of ''an historic(al)'' in American English.&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, p. 49.{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the New Oxford Dictionary of English, such use is increasingly rare in British English too.&lt;ref name="New Oxford"/&gt; Unlike British English, American English typically uses ''an'' before ''herb'', since the ''h'' in this word is silent for most Americans. The correct usage in respect of the term "hereditary peer" was the subject of an amendment debated in the UK Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199899/ldhansrd/vo990427/text/90427-43.htm{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Using ''a'' before a word beginning with a vowel sound in unstressed syllables is not uncommon, but is universally considered non-standard.--&gt;

The word ''some'' can be viewed as functionally a plural of ''a/an'' in that, for example, "an apple" never means more than one apple but "give me ''some'' apples" indicates more than one is desired but without specifying a quantity. In this view it is functionally homologous to the Spanish plural indefinite article ''unos/unas''; ''un/una'' ("one") is completely indistinguishable from the unit number, except where it has a plural form (''unos/unas''). Thus ''Dame una manzana" ("Give me an apple")'' but "Dame ''unas'' manzanas" ("Give me ''some'' apples"). The indefiniteness of ''some'' or ''unos'' can sometimes be [[wikt:semiquantitative#Adjective|semiquantitatively]] narrowed, as in "There are ''some'' apples there, but not many."

''Some'' also serves as a singular indefinite article, as in "There is ''some'' person on the porch".

==Proper article==

A '''proper''' article indicates that its [[Proper noun|noun is proper]], and refers to a unique entity. It may be the name of a person, the name of a place, the name of a planet, etc. The [[Maori language]] has the proper article ''a'', which is used for personal nouns; so, "a Pita" means "Peter". In Maori, when the personal nouns have the definite or indefinite article as an important part of it, both articles are present; for example, the phrase "a Te Rauparaha", which contains both the proper article ''a'' and the definite article ''Te'' refers to the person name [[Te Rauparaha]].

The definite article is sometimes also used with [[Proper noun|proper name]]s, which are already specified by definition (there ''is'' just one of them). For example: ''the Amazon, the Hebrides''. In these cases, the definite article may be considered superfluous. Its presence can be accounted for by the assumption that they are shorthand for a longer phrase in which the name is a specifier, i.e. ''the Amazon River'', ''the Hebridean Islands''. Where the nouns in such longer phrases cannot be omitted, the definite article is universally kept: ''the United States'', ''the People's Republic of China''. This distinction can sometimes become a political matter: the former usage ''the Ukraine'' stressed the word's Russian meaning of "borderlands"; as [[Ukraine]] became a fully independent state following the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], it requested that formal mentions of its name omit the article. Similar shifts in usage have occurred in the names of [[Sudan]] and both [[Congo (Brazzaville)]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo (Kinshasa)]]; a move in the other direction occurred with [[The Gambia]]. In certain languages, such as French and Italian, definite articles are used with all or most names of countries: ''la France/le Canada/l'Allemagne, l'Italia/la Spagna/il Brasile''.

{{quote|text=If a name [has] a definite article, e.g. ''[[Moscow Kremlin|the Kremlin]]'', it cannot idiomatically be used without it: we cannot say ''[[Boris Yeltsin]] is in Kremlin''.|author=[[Robert Burchfield|R. W. Burchfield]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=R. W.|last=Burchfield|authorlink=Robert Burchfield|page=512|year=1996|edition=3rd|title=[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage|The New Fowler's Modern English Usage]]|isbn=978-0199690367}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some languages also use definite articles with [[personal name]]s. For example, such use is standard in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (''a Maria'', literally: "the Maria"), in [[Greek language|Greek]] (η Μαρία, ο Γιώργος, ο Δούναβης, η Παρασκευή) and in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (la Núria, el/en Oriol). It also occurs colloquially in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and other languages. In [[Hungary]] it is considered to be a [[Germanism (linguistics)|Germanism]].

Rarely, this usage can appear in English. A prominent example is how [[President of The United States]] and businessman [[Donald Trump]] is known as "The Donald", this wording being used by many publications such as ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[New York Post]]''. (This is derived from his ex-wife [[Ivana Trump]]'s use of the article with his name, a second-language error influenced by the lack of articles in her native [[Slovene language|Slovene]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Argetsinger|first1=Amy|title=Why does everyone call Donald Trump ‘The Donald’? It’s an interesting story.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/09/01/why-does-everyone-call-donald-trump-the-donald-its-an-interesting-story/|accessdate=3 October 2017|work=Washington Post|date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is US President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s nickname of "The Gipper";&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/09/01/why-does-everyone-call-donald-trump-the-donald-its-an-interesting-story/&lt;/ref&gt; publisher [[Townhall.com]] issued an article after Reagan's death titled simply "Goodbye to 'the Gipper'".&lt;ref&gt;http://townhall.com/columnists/patbuchanan/2004/06/08/goodbye_to_the_gipper/page/full&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partitive article==

&lt;!-- This section is linked from the redirect "Partitive article". If the section title changes, please update the redirect accordingly. --&gt;

A '''partitive''' article is a type of article, sometimes viewed as a type of indefinite article, used with a [[mass noun]] such as ''water'', to indicate a non-specific quantity of it. Partitive articles are a class of [[determiner]]; they are used in [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] in addition to definite and indefinite articles. (In [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]], the partitive is indicated by inflection.) The nearest equivalent in English is ''some'', although the latter is classified as a [[determiner]] but not in all authorities' classifications as an indefinite article, and English uses it less than French uses ''de''. 
: French: ''Veux-tu '''du''' café ?''
: ''Do you want ('''some''') coffee?''

:For more information, see the article on [[French articles and determiners#Partitive article|the French partitive article]].

[[Haida language|Haida]] has a partitive article (suffixed ''-gyaa'') referring to "part of something or... to one or more objects of a given group or category," e.g., ''tluugyaa uu hal tlaahlaang'' "he is making a boat (a member of the category of boats)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawrence|first=Erma|year=1977|title=Haida dictionary|location=Fairbanks|publisher=Alaska Native Language Center|ref=harv|page=64|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/recordDetails.jsp?ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED162532&amp;searchtype=keyword&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;_pageLabel=RecordDetails&amp;accno=ED162532&amp;_nfls=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative article==

&lt;!-- This section is linked from the redirect "Negatie article". If the section title changes, please update the redirect accordingly. --&gt;

A '''negative''' article specifies ''none'' of its noun, and can thus be regarded as neither definite nor indefinite. On the other hand, some consider such a word to be a simple [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]] rather than an article. In English, this function is fulfilled by ''no'', which can appear before a singular or plural noun: 
: '''''No''' man has been on this island.''
: '''''No''' dogs are allowed here.''
: '''''No''' one is in the room.''

==Zero article==

{{See also|Zero article in English}}

The '''zero article''' is the absence of an article. In languages having a definite article, the lack of an article specifically indicates that the noun is indefinite. Linguists interested in [[X-bar theory]] causally link zero articles to nouns lacking a determiner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0346-251X(97)00010-9 |title=The English article system: Acquisition, function, and pedagogy |journal=System |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=215–232 |year=1997 |last1=Master |first1=Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt; In English, the zero article rather than the indefinite is used with [[grammatical number|plurals]] and [[mass noun]]s, although the word "some" can be used as an indefinite plural article.

: '''''Visitors''' end up walking in '''mud'''.''

==Variation among languages==

[[File:EuropeArticleLanguages.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Articles in languages in and around Europe {{legend|darkblue|indefinite and definite articles}} {{legend|blue|only definite articles}} {{legend|darkmagenta|indefinite and suffixed definite articles}} {{legend|magenta|only suffixed definite articles}} {{legend|lightgray|no articles}} Note that although the Saami languages spoken in northern parts of Norway and Sweden lack articles, Norwegian and Swedish are the majority languages in this area. Note also that although the Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Welsh languages lack indefinite articles they too are minority languages in Ireland, Scotland and southern Wales, respectively, with English being the main spoken language.]]

Articles are found in many [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] languages, [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] languages (only the definite article), and [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] languages, but are formally absent from many of the world’s major languages, such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]],  [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Urdu]], the majority of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] and [[Baltic languages]] (incl. [[Russian language|Russian]]), [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], and the [[Bantu languages]]. In some languages that do have articles, like for example some [[North Caucasian languages]], the use of articles is optional but in others like English and German it is mandatory in all cases.

Linguists believe the common ancestor of the [[Indo-European languages]], [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]], did not have articles. Most of the languages in this family do not have definite or indefinite articles: there is no article in [[Latin]] or [[Sanskrit]], nor in some modern Indo-European languages, such as the families of [[Slavic languages]] (except for [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], which are rather distinctive among the Slavic languages in their grammar) and [[Baltic languages]]. Although [[Ancient Greek|Classical]] [[Greek language|Greek]] had a definite article (which has survived into [[Modern Greek]] and which bears strong functional resemblance to the German definite article, which it is related to), the earlier [[Homeric Greek]] used this article largely as a pronoun or demonstrative, whereas the earliest known form of Greek known as [[Mycenaean Greek]] did not have any articles. Articles developed independently in several language families.

Not all languages have both definite and indefinite articles, and some languages have different types of definite and indefinite articles to distinguish finer shades of meaning: for example, [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] have a partitive article used for indefinite [[mass noun]]s, whereas [[Colognian language|Colognian]] has two distinct sets of definite articles indicating focus and uniqueness, and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] uses definite articles in a demonstrative sense, with a tripartite distinction (proximal, medial, distal) based on distance from the speaker or interlocutor. The words ''this'' and ''that'' (and their plurals, ''these'' and ''those'') can be understood in English as, ultimately, forms of the definite article ''the'' (whose declension in Old English included ''thaes'', an ancestral form of this/that and these/those).

In many languages, the form of the article may vary according to the [[grammatical gender|gender]], [[grammatical number|number]], or [[grammatical case|case]] of its noun. In some languages the article may be the only indication of the case. Many languages do not use articles at all, and may use other ways of indicating old versus new information, such as [[topic–comment]] constructions.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Grammatically speaking [[Finnish language|Finnish]] has no articles, but the words ''se'' (it) and ''yks(i)'' (one) are used in the same fashion as ''the'' and ''a/an'' in English and are, for all intents and purposes, treated like articles when used in this manner in [[colloquial Finnish]]. 

The following examples show articles which are always suffixed to the noun:

* [[Albanian language|Albanian]]: ''zog'', a bird; ''zog'''u''''', the bird
* [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]: שלם (shalam), peace; שלמ'''א''' (shalma), the peace
** Note: Aramaic is written from right to left, so an [[Aleph]] is added to the end of the word. ם becomes מ when it is not the final letter. 
* [[Assamese language|Assamese]]: "কিতাপ (kitap)", book; "কিতাপ'''খন''' (kitapkhôn)" : "The book"
* [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: "Bôi", book; "Bôi'''ti'''/Bôi'''ta'''/Bôi'''khana'''" : "The Book"
* [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: стол ''stol'', chair; стол'''ът''' ''stolǎt'', the chair ([[Subject (grammar)|subject]]); стола ''stol'''a''''', the chair ([[Object (grammar)|object]])
* [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]: ''hestur'', horse; ''hestur'''inn''''', the horse
* [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: стол ''stol'', chair; стол'''от''' ''stolot'', the chair; стол'''ов''' ''stolov'', this chair; стол'''он''' ''stolon'', that chair
* [[Persian language|Persian]]: ''sib'', apple. (The Persian language does not have definite articles. It has one indefinite article 'yek' that means one. In Persian if a noun is not indefinite, it is a definite noun. "Sib e' man، means my apple. Here 'e' is like 'of' in English; an so literally "Sib e man" means the apple of mine.)
* [[Romanian language|Romanian]]: ''drum'', road; ''drum''u'''''l''''', the road (the article is just "l", "u" is a "connection [[vowel]]" {{lang-ro|vocală de legătură}})
* [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''hus'', house; ''hus'''et''''', the house; if there is an adjective: '''''det''' gamle (N)/gamla (S) hus'''et''''', the old house
* [[Danish language|Danish]]: ''hus'', house; ''hus'''et''''', the house; if there is an adjective: '''''det''' gamle hus'', the old house

Examples of prefixed definite articles: 
* {{lang-he|ילד}}, transcribed as ''yeled'', a boy; {{lang|he|הילד|rtl=yes}}, transcribed as {{transl|he|'''ha'''yeled}}, the boy
* {{lang-mt|ktieb}}, a book; {{lang|mt|il-ktieb|rtl=yes}}, the book; {{lang-mt|għotja}}, a donation; {{lang|mt|l-għotja|rtl=yes}}, the donation; {{lang-mt|ċavetta}}, a key; {{lang|mt|iċ-ċavetta|rtl=yes}}, the key; {{lang-mt|dar}}, a house; {{lang|mt|id-dar|rtl=yes}}, the house; {{lang-mt|nemla}}, an ant; {{lang|mt|in-nemla|rtl=yes}}, the ant; {{lang-mt|ras}}, a head; {{lang|mt|ir-ras|rtl=yes}}, the head; {{lang-mt|sodda}}, a bed; {{lang|mt|is-sodda|rtl=yes}}, the bed; {{lang-mt|tuffieħa}}, an apple; {{lang|mt|it-tuffieħa|rtl=yes}}, the apple; {{lang-mt|xahar}}, a month; {{lang|mt|ix-xahar|rtl=yes}}, the month; {{lang-mt|zunnarija}}, a carrot; {{lang|mt|iz-zunnarija|rtl=yes}}, the carrot; {{lang-mt|żmien}}, a time; {{lang|mt|iż-żmien|rtl=yes}}, the time

A different way, limited to the definite article, is used by [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]. 
The noun does not change but the adjective can be defined or undefined. In Latvian: ''galds'', a table / the table; ''balt'''s''' galds'', a white table; ''balt'''ais''' galds'', the white table. In Lithuanian: ''stalas'', a table / the table; ''balt'''as''' stalas'', a white table; ''baltas'''is''' stalas'', the white table.

Languages in the above table written in ''italics'' are [[constructed languages]] and are not natural, that is to say that they have been purposefully invented by an individual (or group of individuals) with some purpose in mind. They do, however, all belong to language families themselves. [[Esperanto]] is derived from European languages and therefore all of its roots are found in [[Proto-Indo-European]] and cognates can be found in real-world languages like French, German, Italian and English. [[Interlingua]] is also based on European languages but with its main source being that of Italic descendent languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, with German and Russian being secondary sources, with words from further afield (but internationally known and often borrowed) contributing to the language's vocabulary (such as words taken from Japanese, Arabic and Finnish). The result is a supposedly easy-to-learn language for the world. As well as these [[Auxiliary languages|"auxiliary" languages]] the list contains two more: [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]]; these two languages were created by [[J. R. R. Tolkien| Professor Tolkien]] and used in [[Tolkien's legendarium|his fictional works]]. They are not based on any real-world language family (as are Esperanto and Interlingua), but do share a common history with roots in [[Common Eldarin]]. 

=== Tokelauan ===
When using a definite article in [[Tokelauan language]], unlike in some languages like English, if the speaker is speaking of an item, they need not to have referred to it previously as long as the item is specific.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simona|first1=Ropati|title=Tokelau Dictionary|date=1986|publisher=Office of Tokelau Affairs|location=New Zealand|page=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also true when it comes to the reference of a specific person.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; So, although the definite article used to describe a noun in the Tokelauan language is ''te'', it can also translate to the indefinite article in languages that requires the item being spoken of to have been referenced prior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When translating to English, ''te'' could translate to the English definite article ''the'', or it could also translate to the English indefinite article ''a''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An example of how the definite article ''te'' can be used as an interchangeable definite or indefinite article in the Tokelauan language would be the sentence “''Kua hau te tino''”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the English language, this could be translated as “'''A man has arrived'''” or “'''The man has arrived'''” where using ''te'' as the article in this sentence can represent any man or a particular man.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The word ''he'', which is the indefinite article in Tokelauan, is used to describe ‘any such item’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The word ''he'' is used in negative statements because that is where it is most often found, alongside its great use in interrogative statements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Though this is something to make note of, ''he'' is not used in just in negative statements and questions alone. Although these two types of statements are where ''he'' occurs the most, it is also used in other statements as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An example of the use of ''he'' as an indefinite article is “''Vili ake oi k'aumai he toki'' ”, where ‘''he toki'' ’ mean ‘'''an axe'''’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The use of ''he'' and ''te'' in Tokelauan are reserved for when describing a singular noun. However, when describing a plural noun, different articles are used. For plural definite nouns, rather than ''te'', the article ''nā'' is used.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ‘''Vili ake oi k'aumai nā nofoa''’ in Tokelauan would translate to “'''Do run and bring me the chairs'''” in English.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are some special cases in which instead of using ''nā'', plural definite nouns have no article before them. The absence of an article is represented by ''0''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One way that it is usually used is if a large amount or a specific class of things are being described.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Occasionally, such as if one was describing an entire class of things in a nonspecific fashion, the singular definite noun ''te'' would is used.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In English, ‘''Ko te povi e kai mutia''’ means “'''Cows eat grass'''”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because this is a general statement about cows, ''te'' is used instead of ''nā''. The ''ko'' serves as a preposition to the “''te''” The article ''ni'' is used for describing a plural indefinite noun. ‘''E i ei ni tuhi?''’ translates to “'''Are there any books?'''”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Evolution==

Articles have developed independently in many different language families across the globe. Generally, articles develop over time usually by specialization of certain [[adjectives]] or [[determiners]], and their development is often a sign of languages becoming more analytic instead of synthetic, perhaps combined with the loss of [[inflection]] as in English, Romance languages, Bulgarian, Macedonian and Torlakian.

[[Joseph Greenberg]] in
Universals of Human Language&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=maft03b0cqUC|title=Genetic Linguistics:Essays on Theory and Method|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
describes "the cycle of the definite article": Definite articles (Stage I) evolve from demonstratives, and in turn can become generic articles (Stage II) that may be used in both definite and indefinite contexts, and later merely noun markers (Stage III) that are part of nouns other than proper names and more recent borrowings. Eventually articles may evolve anew from demonstratives.

=== Definite articles ===

Definite articles typically arise from [[demonstrative]]s meaning ''that''. For example, the definite articles in most [[Romance languages]]—e.g., ''el'', ''il'', ''le'', ''la'', ''lo'' — derive from the [[Latin]] demonstratives ''ille'' (masculine), ''illa'' (feminine) and ''illud'' (neuter).

The [[English language|English]] definite article ''[[English articles|the]]'', written ''þe'' in [[Middle English]], derives from an [[Old English language|Old English]] demonstrative, which, according to [[grammatical gender|gender]], was written ''se'' (masculine), ''seo'' (feminine) (''þe'' and ''þeo'' in the Northumbrian dialect), or [[That (disambiguation)|''þæt'']] (neuter). The neuter form ''þæt'' also gave rise to the modern demonstrative ''that''. The ''ye'' occasionally seen in pseudo-archaic usage such as "[[Ye Olde]] Englishe Tea Shoppe" is actually a form of ''þe'', where the letter [[thorn (letter)|thorn]] (''þ'') came to be written as a ''y''.

Multiple demonstratives can give rise to multiple definite articles. [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], for example, in which the articles are suffixed, has ''столот'' (''stolot''), the chair; ''столов'' (''stolov''), this chair; and ''столон'' (''stolon''), that chair. These derive from the [[Common Slavic]] demonstratives ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic/tъ|*tъ]]'' "this, that", ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic/ovъ|*ovъ]]'' "this here" and ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic/onъ|*onъ]]'' "that over there, yonder" respectively. [[Colognian language|Colognian]] prepositions articles such as in ''dat Auto'', or ''et Auto'', the car; the first being specifically selected, focused, newly introduced, while the latter is not selected, unfocused, already known, general, or generic. Standard [[Basque language|Basque]] distinguishes between proximal and distal definite articles in the plural (dialectally, a proximal singular and an additional medial grade may also be present). The Basque distal form (with infix ''-a-'', etymologically a suffixed and phonetically reduced form of the distal demonstrative ''har-/hai-'') functions as the default definite article, whereas the proximal form (with infix ''-o-'', derived from the proximal demonstrative ''hau-/hon-'') is [[markedness#Marked and unmarked word pairs|marked]] and indicates some kind of (spatial or otherwise) close relationship between the speaker and the referent (e.g., it may imply that the speaker is included in the referent): ''etxeak'' ("the houses") vs. ''etxeok'' ("these houses [of ours]"), ''euskaldunak'' ("the Basque speakers") vs. ''euskaldunok'' ("we, the Basque speakers").

=== Indefinite articles ===

Indefinite articles typically arise from adjectives meaning ''one''. For example, the indefinite articles in the [[Romance languages]]—e.g., ''un'', ''una'', ''une''—derive from the [[Latin]] adjective ''unus''. Partitive articles, however, derive from [[Vulgar Latin]] ''de illo'', meaning ''(some) of the''.

The [[English language|English]] indefinite article ''[[English articles|an]]'' is derived from the same root as ''one''. The ''-n'' came to be dropped before consonants, giving rise to the shortened form ''a''. The existence of both forms has led to many cases of [[juncture loss]], for example transforming the original ''a napron'' into the modern ''an apron''.

The [[Persian language|Persian]] indefinite article is ''yek'',  meaning one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1633">In the law of [[tort]]s, '''bellwether trial''' is a [[Test case (law)|test case]] intended to try a widely contested issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://works.bepress.com/alexandra_lahav/3/|title=Bellwether Trials|author=Alexandra D. Lahav|accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellwether [[Trial|trials]] are an increasingly common phenomenon in [[United States|U.S.]] [[Practice of law|legal practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://product-liability.weil.com/mass-tort/the-spread-of-bellwether-trials/|title=The Spread of Bellwether Trials|author=Jeremy Grabill|date= May 18, 2011|accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellwether trials are especially common in [[Multidistrict Litigation]] (MDL) practice, where many cases have been consolidated for purposes of [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] and pretrial matters. In these MDL cases, it is not practical to prepare every case for trial. Several matters are, therefore, selected as bellwether cases and prepared for trial. They are then settled or tried and the results are used to shape the process for addressing the remaining cases.&lt;ref&gt;Manual for Complex Litigation, Fourth, §22.315&lt;/ref&gt;

A bellwether trial is designed to achieve value ascertainment function for [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] purposes or to answer troubling [[Causation (law)|causation]] or liability issues common to a universe of [[Plaintiff|claimants]].&lt;ref&gt;In re Chevron U.S.A., Inc. F.3d 1016 (5th Cir. 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; For the tried cases to achieve these purposes, it must be representative of all cases.

== Building ==

The construction of the building began in summer 2008. The architect is [[Yves Lion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bulac.fr/pole/presentation/|language=French|publisher=Official website of the BULAC|title=Le Pôle des langues et civilisations}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The building is under the responsibility of the region [[Île-de-France]] which also provided two third of the financing, the [[France|French State]] provided the rest.

'''''Big Miracle''''' tells the true story of three gray whales trapped beneath [[Arctic]] ice in the fall of 1988, and of [[Operation Breakthrough]], the collaborative efforts to free them by oil company executives, activists, [[Inupiat]] people, the U.S. military, and [[Soviet]] [[ice-breaker|ice-breakers]].&lt;ref name="pw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Miracle|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-312-62519-1|website=[[Publishers Weekly]]|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="free"&gt;{{cite news | last1=Dorfman | first1=Andrea | last2=Postman | first2=David | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,968853,00.html | title=Environment: Free At Last!

In the [[United States]], a '''Black Hispanic'''&lt;ref name="U.S. Census Bureau"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/compraceho.html|title=U.S. Census Bureau Guidance on the Presentation and Comparison of Race and Hispanic Origin Data|work=U.S. Census Bureau|date=June 12, 2003|accessdate=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Afro-Hispanic'''&lt;ref name="U.S. Census Bureau" /&gt; ({{lang-es|Afrohispano|links=no}}), is an American [[citizen]] or resident who is officially classified by the [[United States Census Bureau]], [[Office of Management and Budget]] and other U.S. government agencies as a black person or racially black of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] [[Genealogy|descent]]."&lt;ref name=cen&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/meta/long_RHI125214.htm|work=U.S. Census Bureau|title=Race: 2010 Census of Population, P94-171 Redistricting Data File|date=2010|accessdate=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hispanic]]ity, which is independent of race, is the only ''[[ethnic]]'' category, as opposed to racial category, which is officially collated by the [[U.S. Census Bureau]]. The distinction made by government agencies for those within the population of any official race category, including "Black", is between those who report [[Hispanic]] backgrounds and all others who do not. ''Non-Hispanic Blacks'' consists of an ethnically diverse collection of all others who are classified as Black or African American that do not report Hispanic ethnic backgrounds.

==Demographic information==
States like [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Connecticut]] have some of the highest percentages of Hispanics identifying as Black, where up to 25% of Hispanics identify as black, compared to 2.5% of Hispanics nationwide.&lt;ref name="factfinder.census.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_1YR_DP05&amp;prodType=table|title=ACS Demographic and Housing Estimates: 2013 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates|publisher=US Census Bureau|date=2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102154030/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_13_1YR_DP05&amp;prodType=table|archivedate=January 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="factfinder.census.gov"/&gt; Overall, the Northeast region has the largest concentration of Black Hispanics, this is partly because of the large Puerto Rican, Dominican, and other mostly or partly African descended Hispanic populations in the region.&lt;ref name="factfinder.census.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=189208140|title=Coming Out As Black, When You Were Hispanic|publisher=npr.org|date=June 6, 2013|accessdate=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main aspects which distinguish Black Hispanics born in the United States of America from [[African American]]s is having Spanish as their [[mother tongue]] or most recent ancestors' native language, their culture passed down by their parents, and their [[Spanish naming customs|Spanish surnames]]. Of all Hispanic groups, Puerto Ricans have the closest relationship with the African American community, and because of this there is also increasing intermarriages and offspring between non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics of any race, mainly between Puerto Ricans and African Americans, which increases both the Hispanic ethnic and black racial demographics.&lt;ref name="Alex-AssensohHanks2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cruz|first=José E.|editor1=Yvette Marie Alex-Assensoh|editor2=Lawrence J.

Since the early days of the movie industry in the United States of America, when Black Hispanic actors were given roles, they would usually be cast as African Americans.&lt;ref name="hispanics_on_tv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehispanicmyth.com/Hispanics_on_TV_myth.htm|title=Myth: Hispanics are portrayed accurately on TV|publisher=thehispanicmyth.com|accessdate=May 17, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604015632/http://thehispanicmyth.com/Hispanics_on_TV_myth.htm|archivedate=June 4, 2008|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those with Spanish-speaking accents that betrayed an otherwise presumed African American, they may seldom have been given roles as Hispanics, and the mixed race Hispanic and Latino actors of African appearance were mostly given Hispanic roles.

Those who claim that Black Hispanics are not sought to play Hispanic roles in the United States allege this unfairly leads the masses of viewers to an ignorance to the existence of [[Afro-Latin American|darker skinned Hispanics]]. Further, some Black Hispanics who identify themselves as black but of also [[Multiracial|mixed race]] heritage once affirming their Hispanicity may be deprived of their status as Black people among African Americans, and categorized by society as non-Black in the American historical context.

Same situation happens in U.S. Hispanic media; critics accuse U.S. Hispanic media, including Latin American media, of overlooking black Hispanic and Latino Americans and [[Afro-Latin American|black Latin Americans]] in the ''[[telenovela]]s'', mostly stereotyping them as impoverished people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/58525?tid=relatedcl|title=Y Tu Black Mama Tambien: Latinos Are Racist, Too.

== Health ==
A review of twenty-one studies found Black Hispanics to have poorer health compared to White Hispanics. The causes are still unknown, but researchers suggested that racial discrimination and segregation may contribute to racial health differences among the Hispanic population in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cuevas|first=Adolfo G.|last2=Dawson|first2=Beverly Araujo|last3=Williams|first3=David R.|date=December 2016|title=Race and Skin Color in Latino Health: An Analytic Review|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=106|issue=12|pages=2131–2136|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2016.303452|issn=0090-0036|pmc=5104999|pmid=27736206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Black Hispanics are often overlooked or dichotomized as either "black" or "hispanic" in the United States of America, Black Hispanic writers often reflect upon their [[racialized]] experience in their works. The most commonly used term in literature to speak of this ambiguity and multilayered hybridity at the heart of Latino/a identity and culture is ''miscegenation''.&lt;ref name="PinnValentin2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinn|first1=Anthony B.|authorlink1=Anthony B. Pinn|author2=Benjamin Valentin|title=Ties That Bind: African American and Hispanic American/Latino/a Theologies in Dialogue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T05YAAAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-0-8264-1326-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48}} This "mestizaje" depicts the multi-faceted racial and cultural identity that characterize Black Hispanics and highlights that each individual Black Hispanic has a unique experience within a broader racial and ethnic range.&lt;ref name="PinnValentin2001" /&gt;{{rp|49}} The memoirs, poetry, sociological research, and essays written by the following Afro-Latino writers reflect this concept of mestizaje in addition to revealing the confusion and uncertainty about one's self-image of being both "Black" and "Hispanic". The psychological and social factors also prove to be central in determining how one ultimately defines him/herself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2470">The '''Book of Aksum''' ([[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge'ez]] መጽሐፈ ፡ አክሱም ''maṣḥafa aksūm'', {{lang-am|meṣhafe aksūm}}, {{lang-ti|meṣḥafe aksūm}}, {{lang-la|Liber Axumae}}) is the name accepted since the time of [[James Bruce]] for a collection of documents from [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion|St. Mary's Cathedral]] of [[Aksum]] providing information on [[Ethiopia]]n [[historiography|history]]. The earliest parts of the collection date to the mid-15th century during the reign of [[Zara Yaqob|Zar'a Ya`qob]] (r. 1434-1468).

The book's editor [[Carlo Conti Rossini]] classified the book into three parts: the first, earlier, section describes the Church [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion|Maryam Seyon]] in [[Aksum]] prior to its damaging in the mid-16th century, the topography of Aksum and its history, and contains a list of services and the like regarding Maryam Seyon and its clergy. The second part is dated to the early 17th century and contains 103 historical and legal texts, many dealing with land grants, along with their protocols, while the third text dates to the late 17th century and contains 14 miscellaneous legal and historical texts regarding [[Aksum]]'s history. The book was also supplemented in the mid-19th century with further later documents.&lt;ref&gt;Lusini, Gianfrancesco "Aksum:Mäṣḥafä Aksum" in Uhlig, Siegbert et alii, ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica, vol. 1: A-C'' (Wiesbaden:Harrassowitz Verlag, 2003.), p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Cracking Art movement was born in 1993 in [[Biella]]. It was founded by Omar Ronda, Alex Angi, Renzo Nucara, Carlo Rizzetti, Marco Veronese and Vittorio Valente who left the group almost immediately replaced by Kicco. In 2001 Alessandro Pianca has been part of the group for one year. In 2003 William Sweetlove joined the movement. In 2008, Omar Ronda, the founder, abandoned the project in order to follow his personal career.

Cracking Art movement is currently formed by five artists: Alex Angi, Renzo Nucara, Marco Veronese, William Sweetlove and Kicco. The common aim is to change the history of art through a strong social and environmental commitment that, combined with an innovative use of plastic materials, evokes the close relationship between natural and artificial reality.

==Philosophy==

The name "Cracking Art" comes from the verb "to crack" which indicates the state of being split, broken, crashed. Moreover, the catalytic cracking is the name that stands for the chemical reaction occurring when the raw [[crude oil]] is converted into [[plastic]]. This is the reason why for the movement "cracking" represents the moment when something natural becomes artificial, the most important instant that for the artists of the movement should be represented through art.

# Cracking is the process that transforms [[petroleum]] into virgin [[naphtha]], a material used for creating many products of synthesis as plastic.
# Cracking is the gap of the contemporary man who struggles between his primary naturalness and a future that becomes more and more artificial.
# Plastic finds its roots in a millenary tradition of civilization, in a huge and deep cultural evolution that link together the human being, the artificial creations and the environmental nature. In a certain sense Cracking could be considered as a conceptual formula used to challenge the rules of contemporary art.
# Cracking is the process that transforms natural into artificial, organic into synthetic. It is the process that puts us all in front of new realities.&lt;ref&gt;Luca Beatrice, Tommaso Trini, ''Cracking Art'', Adriano Parise, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

===The concept of Regeneration===

The concept of Regeneration enlivens the artistic history of the movement since its origins. The plastic, chosen material of the movement, has the eternal property of being crushed and reshaped into other sculptures. The artworks are designed to inspire sensibility in recycling plastic for the environment while leaving a significant artistic value to the world we live in. [[Recycling]] plastic means to subtract toxic destruction which devastates nature, as well as creating plastic artworks means to communicate through an universal language while paying strong attention to the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Damian Sausset in ''Treviso 2010 - Cracking Art - Regeneration'', Consorzio Per Mio Figlio, Treviso 2010, pp. 47-52&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim is to connect common reasoning to individual meditation, creating installations with animals that appear unexpectedly in everyday places. The astonishment of meeting an ordinary subject transformed into something extraordinary through its super size, color and shape catches people attention and invites them to see urban life and cities in a different way.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Alton in ''Treviso 2010 - Cracking Art - Regeneration'', Consorzio Per Mio Figlio, Treviso 2010, pp. 53-55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greek science==
An early attempt at demarcation can be seen in the efforts of Greek natural philosophers and medical practitioners to distinguish their methods and their accounts of nature from the mythological or mystical accounts of their predecessors and contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lloyd | first = G. E. R. | author-link = G. E. R.

[N]ot only do they reject interference in most cases from priests and prophets, they also criticise many current practices and assumptions. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Aristotle described at length what was involved in having scientific knowledge of something. To be scientific, he said, one must deal with causes, one must use logical demonstration, and one must identify the universals which 'inhere' in the particulars of sense. But above all, to have science one must have ''[[Apodicticity|apodictic certainty]]''. It is the last feature which, for Aristotle, most clearly distinguished the scientific way of knowing.&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"/&gt;|[[Larry Laudan]]|''Physics, Philosophy, and Psychoanalysis'', "The Demise of the Demarcation Problem"}}
In Charmides Plato discusses a "science of science". Although the subject in the dialogue is epistemological, it is an early version of the demarcation problem.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable secondary source.|date=August 2018}}

[[G. E. R. Lloyd]] notes that there was a sense in which the groups engaged in various forms of inquiry into nature set out to "legitimate their own positions,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lloyd | first = G. E. R. | author-link = G. E. R.

==Logical positivism==
[[Logical positivism]], formulated in the 1920s, held that only statements about matters of fact or logical relations between concepts are meaningful. All other statements lack sense and are labelled "[[Metaphysics#Rejections of metaphysics|metaphysics]]" (see [[the verifiability theory of meaning]] also known as [[verificationism]]). This distinction between science, which in the view of the [[Vienna Circle]] possessed empirically verifiable statements, and what they pejoratively called "metaphysics", which lacked such statements, can be seen as representing another aspect of the demarcation problem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kYUFhlIRZA4C&amp;pg=PT97&amp;dq=demarcation+%22logical+positivism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z9n8U7vdEuKw7AbYgIG4DA&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBDhG#v=onepage&amp;q=demarcation%20%22logical%20positivism%22&amp;f=false Grayling, AC., ''Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, 2001, pp. 67-68.]&lt;/ref&gt; Logical positivism is often discussed in the context of the demarcation between science and non-science or pseudoscience. However, "The verificationist proposals had the aim of solving a distinctly different demarcation problem, namely that between science and metaphysics."&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science2"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sven Ove |last=Hansson |editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta |year=2008 |title=Science and Pseudo-Science |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/pseudo-science#LogPos |at=4.1 The Logical Positivists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Falsifiability==
[[Falsifiability]] is the demarcation criterion proposed by [[Karl Popper]] as opposed to verificationism: "statements or systems of statements, in order to be ranked as scientific, must be capable of conflicting with possible, or conceivable observations".&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sven Ove |last=Hansson |editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta |year=2008 |title=Science and Pseudo-Science |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=Fall 2008 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/pseudo-science#KarPop |at=4.2 Falsificationism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper saw demarcation as a central problem in the philosophy of science.  Unlike the Vienna Circle, Popper stated that his proposal was not a criterion of "meaningfulness".

{{quote|Popper's demarcation criterion has been criticized both for excluding legitimate science… and for giving some pseudosciences the status of being scientific… According to Larry Laudan (1983, 121), it "has the untoward consequence of countenancing as 'scientific' every crank claim which makes ascertainably false assertions". Astrology, rightly taken by Popper as an unusually clear example of a pseudoscience, has in fact been tested and thoroughly refuted… Similarly, the major threats to the scientific status of psychoanalysis, another of his major targets, do not come from claims that it is untestable but from claims that it has been tested and failed the tests.&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;|[[Sven Ove Hansson]]|''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', "Science and Pseudo-Science"}}

In Popper's later work, he stated that falsifiability is both a necessary and a sufficient criterion for demarcation. He described falsifiability as a property of "the logical structure of sentences and classes of sentences," so that a statement's scientific or non-scientific status does not change over time. This has been summarized as a statement being falsifiable "if and only if it logically contradicts some (empirical) sentence that describes a logically possible event that it would be logically possible to observe."&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;

[[Nicholas Maxwell]] has argued that physics only accepts theories that are sufficiently unified, this persistent preference for unity committing physics to accepting an implicit metaphysical (i.e. non-falsifiable) thesis concerning the unity of nature.  For good Popperian reasons, this implicit metaphysical thesis needs to be made explicit within physics so that it can be critically assessed and, we may hope, improved.  Popper's demarcation criterion is refuted: an unfalsifiable, metaphysical thesis is a basic tenet of scientific knowledge within physics, whether this is recognized or not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Maxwell]] (1974) [http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1348844/ The Rationality of Scientific Discovery] Philosophy of Science, 41 (2) 123-153; 1998 [https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-comprehensibility-of-the-universe-9780199261550?lang=en&amp;cc=gb The Comprehensibility of the Universe] Clarendon Press, Oxford; 2017 [http://www.paragonhouse.com/xcart/Understanding-Scientific-Progress-Aim-Oriented-Empiricism.html Understanding Scientific Progress] Paragon House, St. Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postpositivism==
[[Thomas Kuhn]], an American historian and philosopher of science, is often connected with what has been called [[postpositivism]] or [[postempiricism]]. In his 1962 book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', Kuhn divided the process of doing science into two different endeavors, which he called [[normal science]] and [[extraordinary science]] (which he sometimes also called "revolutionary science"). "In Kuhn's view, 'it is normal science, in which Sir Karl's sort of testing does not occur, rather than extraordinary science which most nearly distinguishes science from other enterprises'…"&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt; That is, the utility of a scientific paradigm for puzzle-solving lies in its suggesting solutions to new problems while continuing to satisfy all of the problems solved by the paradigm that it replaces.

{{quote|Kuhn's view of demarcation is most clearly expressed in his comparison of astronomy with astrology. Since antiquity, astronomy has been a puzzle-solving activity and therefore a science. If an astronomer's prediction failed, then this was a puzzle that he could hope to solve for instance with more measurements or with adjustments of the theory. In contrast, the astrologer had no such puzzles since in that discipline "particular failures did not give rise to research puzzles, for no man, however skilled, could make use of them in a constructive attempt to revise the astrological tradition"… Therefore, according to Kuhn, astrology has never been a science.&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;|[[Sven Ove Hansson]]|''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', "Science and Pseudo-Science"}}

Popper criticized Kuhn's demarcation criterion, saying that astrologers are engaged in puzzle solving, and that therefore Kuhn's criterion recognized astrology as a science. He stated that Kuhn's criterion leads to a "major disaster…[the] replacement of a rational criterion of science by a sociological one".&lt;ref name="sep-pseudo-science"/&gt;

==Feyerabend and Lakatos==
Kuhn's work largely called into question Popper's demarcation, and emphasized the human, [[subjectivity|subjective]] quality of scientific change. [[Paul Feyerabend]] was concerned that the very question of demarcation was insidious: science itself had no need of a demarcation criterion, but instead some philosophers were seeking to justify a special position of authority from which science could dominate public discourse.&lt;ref name="Taylor1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=C.A. |last=Taylor |year=1996 |title=Defining Science: A Rhetoric of Demarcation |series=Rhetoric of the Human Sciences Series |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=9780299150341 |lccn=96000180 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdkDiqh5ySYC&amp;pg=PA41 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend argued that science does not in fact occupy a special place in terms of either its logic or method, and no claim to special authority made by scientists can be upheld. He argued that, within the history of scientific practice, no rule or method can be found that has not been violated or circumvented at some point in order to advance scientific knowledge. Both [[Imre Lakatos]] and Feyerabend suggest that science is not an autonomous form of reasoning, but is inseparable from the larger body of human thought and inquiry.

==Thagard==
[[Paul R. Thagard]] has proposed another set of principles to try to overcome these difficulties, and believes it is important for society to find a way of doing so. According to Thagard's method, a theory is not scientific if it satisfies two conditions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/bnccde/PH29A/thagard.html ''Why Astrology Is A Pseudoscience''], [[Paul R. Thagard]], In Philosophy of Science Association 1978 Volume 1, edited by P.D. Asquith and I. Hacking (East Lansing: Philosophy of Science Association, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;
# The theory has been less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and faces many unsolved problems; and...
# The community of practitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards solutions of the problems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate the theory in relation to others, and is selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations.

Thagard specifies that sometimes theories will spend some time as merely "unpromising" before they truly deserve the title of pseudoscience. He cites astrology as an example: it was stagnant compared to advances in physics during the 17th century, and only later became "pseudoscience" in the advent of alternative explanations provided by psychology during the 19th century.

Thagard also states that his criteria should not be interpreted so narrowly as to allow willful [[ignorance]] of alternative explanations, or so broadly as to discount our modern science compared to science of the future. His definition is a practical one, which generally seeks to distinguish pseudoscience as areas of inquiry which are stagnant and without active scientific investigation.

==Some historians' perspectives==
Many historians of science are concerned with the development of science from its primitive origins; consequently they define science in sufficiently broad terms to include early forms of natural knowledge.  In the article on science in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|eleventh edition]] of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', the scientist and historian [[William Cecil Dampier Whetham]] defined science as "ordered knowledge of natural phenomena and of the relations between them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Dampier Whetham | first = William Cecil | author-link = William Cecil Dampier Whetham | publication-date = 1911 | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | contribution = Science | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | publication-place = New York | url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his study of Greek science, [[Marshall Clagett]] defined science as "first, the orderly and systematic comprehension, description and/or explanation of natural phenomena and, secondly, the [mathematical and logical] tools necessary for the undertaking."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Clagett | first = Marshall | author-link = Marshall Clagett
| publication-date = 1963 | title = Greek Science in Antiquity | publisher = Collier Books | publication-place = New York | page = 4 | isbn = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar definition appeared more recently in [[David Pingree]]'s study of early science: "Science is a systematic explanation of perceived or imaginary phenomena, or else is based on such an explanation.  Mathematics finds a place in science only as one of the symbolical languages in which scientific explanations may be expressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Pingree | first = David | author-link = David Pingree | year = 1992 | title = Hellenophilia versus the History of Science | journal = Isis | volume  = 83 | pages = 554–563 | doi=10.1086/356288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These definitions tend to focus more on the subject matter of science than on its method and from these perspectives, the philosophical concern to establish a line of demarcation between science and non-science becomes "problematic, if not futile."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = McCluskey | first = Stephen C. | editor-last = Fountain | editor-first = John W. | editor2-last = Sinclair | editor2-first = Rolf M. | publication-date = 2005 | title = Current Studies in Archaeoastronomy: Conversations Across Time and Space | chapter = Different Astronomies, Different Cultures and the Question of Cultural Relativism | publisher = Carolina Academic Press | publication-place = Durham, NC | page = 71 | isbn = 0-89089-771-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laudan==
[[Larry Laudan]] concluded, after examining various historical attempts to establish a demarcation criterion, that "philosophy has failed to deliver the goods" in its attempts to distinguish science from non-science—to distinguish science from pseudoscience.  None of the past attempts would be accepted by a majority of philosophers nor, in his view, should they be accepted by them or by anyone else.  He stated that many well-founded beliefs are not scientific and, conversely, many scientific conjectures are not well-founded.  He also stated that demarcation criteria were historically used as {{lang|fr|machines de guerre}} in polemical disputes between "scientists" and "pseudo-scientists."  Advancing a number of examples from everyday practice of football and carpentry and non-scientific scholarship such as literary criticism and philosophy, he saw the question of whether a belief is well-founded or not to be more practically and philosophically significant than whether it is scientific or not.  In his judgment, the demarcation between science and non-science was a pseudo-problem that would best be replaced by focusing on the distinction between reliable and unreliable knowledge, without bothering to ask whether that knowledge is scientific or not.  He would consign phrases like "pseudo-science" or "unscientific" to the rhetoric of politicians or sociologists.&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"/&gt;

Others have disagreed with Laudan. Sebastian Lutz, for example, argues that demarcation does not have to be a single necessary and sufficient condition as Laudan implied.&lt;ref name="Laudan1983"/&gt;  Rather, Laudan's reasoning at the most establishes that there has to be one necessary criterion and one possibly different sufficient criterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lutz |first=Sebastian |title=On an Allegedly Essential Feature of Criteria for the Demarcation of Science |journal=The Reasoner |pages=125–126 |volume=5 |number=8 |year=2011 |url=http://www.kent.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/jw/TheReasoner/vol5/TheReasoner-5(8).pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109143743/http://www.kent.ac.uk/secl/philosophy/jw/TheReasoner/vol5/TheReasoner-5%288%29.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics have argued for multiple demarcation criteria suggesting that there should be one set of criteria for the natural sciences; another set of criteria for the social sciences, and claims involving the supernatural could have a set of pseudoscientific criteria. [[Massimo Pigliucci]] wrote that science generally conforms to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s concept of [[family resemblance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Pigliucci|Pigliucci, Massimo]] (2013). "The Demarcation Problem: A (Belated) Response to Laudan" in Pigliucci, Massimo; [[Maarten Boudry|Boudry, Maarten]], eds. ''Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem'' chapter 1.  {{ISBN|978-0-226-05196-3}}. Pigliucci's chapter is available online at http://philpapers.org/rec/PIGTDP.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Concerning [[science education]], Michael D. Gordin wrote:&lt;ref name=Gordin&gt;Michael D. Gordin (2015) "Myth 27. That a clear line of demarcation has separated science from pseudoscience", in ''Newton’s Apple and other Myths about Science'', [[Ronald L. Numbers]] editor, [[Harvard University Press]] {{doi|10.4159/9780674089167-029}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|220}}
:Every student in public or private takes several years of science, but only a small fraction of them pursue careers in the sciences. We teach the rest of them so much science so that they will appreciate what it ''means'' to be scientific – and, hopefully, become scientifically literate and apply some of those lessons in their lives. For such students, the myth of a bright line of demarcation is essential.
Discussions of the demarcation problem highlight the [[rhetoric of science]] and promote [[critical thinking]]. Citizens thinking critically, and expressing themselves with reasoned argument in [[public policy|policy discussion]], contribute to enlightened democracy. For example, Gordin stated
:Demarcation remains essential for the enormously high political stakes of climate-change denial and other anti-regulatory fringe doctrines.&lt;ref name=Gordin/&gt;{{rp|225}}
The demarcation problem has been compared to the problem of differentiating [[fake news]] from real news, which rose to prominence in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=LeVine |first=Michael V |title=Science has experience fighting fake news — and Facebook should take note |url=https://mic.com/articles/161376/science-has-experience-fighting-fake-news-and-facebook-should-take-note#.m62pUua8z |year=2016 |journal=[[Mic (media company)|Mic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dot and the Kangaroo''''' is a children's book written by [[Ethel Pedley|Ethel C. Pedley]] about a little girl named Dot who gets lost in the Australian [[outback]] and is eventually befriended by a [[kangaroo]] and several other [[marsupial]]s. The book was adapted into a stage production in 1924, and a film in 1977.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Giannalberto Bendazzi, Cartoons: One Hundred Years of Cinema Animation, Indiana university Press, {{ISBN|0-253-20937-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot introduction==
A 5-year-old girl named Dot is lost in the outback after chasing a hare into the wood and losing sight of her home. She is approached by a red kangaroo who gives her some berries to eat. Upon eating the berries, Dot is able to understand the language of all animals, and she tells the kangaroo her plight. The kangaroo, who has lost her own joey, decides to help little Dot despite her own fear of humans. The book is filled with criticism on negative human interference in the wild in 1884.

==Film adaptations==
{{main article|Dot and the Kangaroo (film)}}

A film adaptation was released in 1977 directed by [[Yoram Gross]]. It combines animation with live action.

As defined by the [[United States Census Bureau]], an '''extreme commute''' is a daily [[journey to work]] that takes more than 90 [[minute]]s each way.  According to the bureau, about 3% of American adult workers are so-called "extreme" commuters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/american_community_survey_acs/004489.html US Census Press Releases&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of extreme commuters in the [[New York Metropolitan Area|New York]], [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area|Baltimore-Washington]], [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and [[Greater Los Angeles|Los Angeles]] metropolitan areas is much greater than the national average.

[[Midas (automotive service)|Midas]] sponsored an "America's Longest Commute" award in 2006.

A survey over 2,000 British workers by [[Randstad Holding]] revealed that 9% of British workers commute for over 90 minutes each way.&lt;ref name=randstad2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain’s workers are using their commutes to become more productive, according to research by recruiter Randstad.|url=http://www.randstad.co.uk/about-randstad/news/savvy-super-commuters-spend-time-wisely/|publisher=Randstad|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 7.5% of the Survey's correspondents worked during their commute, with 18% of them believing that smartphones and tablets have made this easier.&lt;ref name=randstad2013 /&gt;

A BBC article in 2013 highlighted multiple reasons for extreme commutes, including lifestyle choice (living in the country and pursuing a London career), relocation of employers, and people increasing their search area when looking for work after redundancy.&lt;ref name=bbc2013&gt;{{cite web|title=The rise of the 'extreme commuter'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25498136|work=BBC Website|publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually Saladino went by one name, "Gaspar," which he wrote in his trademark calligraphy.

From 1966 to the 1990s he lettered many of the logos, titles, captions and balloons on [[DC Comics]] covers.&lt;ref name="klein3"&gt;Klein, Todd. [http://kleinletters.com/Blog/gaspar-saladino-1927-2016/ "Gaspar Saladino 1927-2016"], Kleinletters.com (Aug. 7, 2016). Retrieved August 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; For a period in the 1970s, he was also "page-one letterer" for many [[Marvel Comics]] books.&lt;ref name="klein3" /&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Saladino was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York City, and attended Manhattan's [[School of Industrial Art]].&lt;ref name=kleinpart1 /&gt; While in school Saladino did some [[comic-book]] [[inker|inking]] for [[Lloyd Jacquet]]'s "[[Funnies, Inc.]]", one of several "packagers" of the time that produced outsourced comics for publishers entering the new medium.&lt;ref name=kleinpart1 /&gt; After graduating from high school, Saladino enlisted in the [[U.S. Army]], which stationed him in Japan in a [[public relations]] capacity.&lt;ref name=kleinpart1 /&gt; He returned home in 1947.

=== Career ===

==== Lettering ====
In 1949, he approached [[DC Comics]], where production chief [[Sol Harrison]] showed Saladino's art samples to editors. One, [[Julius Schwartz]], while unimpressed with the art, offered Saladino regular work as a [[letterer]].&lt;ref name=kleinpart1 /&gt; Though working in the office, ensconced between letterer [[Ira Schnapp]] and production artist [[Mort Drucker]], Saladino was employed as a freelancer, earning $2 a page and generally earning $90 a week.&lt;ref name=kleinpart1 /&gt; He recalled in a 2007 interview, "DC wanted a full-time letterer and by being present I got first choice of assignments. I also thought it was beneficial to be able to work hand in hand with the artists."&lt;ref name="BDS" /&gt;

Saladino recalled in 2007 that his first job for DC was a "cowboy romance" comic.&lt;ref name="BDS" /&gt; The title was ''Romance Trail'' #5 (March–April 1950) in which he lettered two stories, "Romance By Mail" with art by Carmine Infantino and Joe Giella, and a one-page poem "Western Serenade" with art by Alex Toth. These were Saladino's first printed works for DC.&lt;ref name=kleinpart1 /&gt; They were followed by more work in ''Romance Trail'' and the western series ''Jimmy Wakely'', starting with issue #5 (June 1950).&lt;ref name=gcd&gt;[http://www.comics.org/letterer/name/gaspar%20saladino/sort/chrono/ Gaspar Saladino] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He did much of the lettering for the humor strips of [[Henry Boltinoff]] in ''[[Action Comics]]''. In the late 1950s and 1960s, Saladino was a mainstay on DC editor [[Julius Schwartz]]'s books, like ''[[Strange Adventures]]'', ''[[Mystery in Space]]'', ''[[Justice League of America]]'', ''[[The Flash]]'', ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'', and many more.

When [[Carmine Infantino]] came on as DC's art director and then editorial director in 1966/1967, he gradually shifted all of DC's premiere lettering tasks: logos, cover lettering and house ads, from veteran letterer [[Ira Schnapp]] to Saladino. This changed the whole line's look, adding Saladino's bold, dynamic style.,&lt;ref name="klein3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BDS" /&gt; Saladino continued to letter many interior pages as well.

In the late 1960s, while freelancing for DC, Saladino began freelancing for Marvel as well, using the pseudonym '''L.P. Gregory'''&lt;ref name=bails&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=SALADINO%2c+GASPAR | authorlink = Jerry Bails | last = Bails | first= Jerry | first2=Hames, eds. | last2=Ware | publisher = The Who's Who of American Comic Books | title = Saladino, Gaspar | accessdate= August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lettering titles including ''Iron Man'', ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[Tales to Astonish]]''.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; In the mid-to-late 1970s Saladino became the uncredited "page-one letterer" for many [[Marvel Comics]] titles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/08/31/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-66/ Mark Evanier quoted in Brian Cronin's "Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed" #66, Comic Book Resources (Aug. 21, 2006).] Retrieved July 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually credited himself as simply either '''Gaspar''' or '''Gaspar S.'''&lt;ref name=bails /&gt;

In 1976, Saladino lettered the historic DC-Marvel crossover comic ''[[Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man]]''. He also lettered the oversize special issue ''[[Superman vs. Muhammad Ali]]''. By 1977, Saladino was lettering most of DC's war comics, in addition to many superhero and mystery stories. From 1976 to 1977, he lettered the [[Los Angeles Times Syndicate]] comic strip ''The Virtue of Vera Valiant'',&lt;ref name=bails /&gt; by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Frank Springer]].

Saladino's output after 2002 was minimal.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

==== Logos ====
[[File:Swthing01.jpg|right|thumb|''Swamp Thing'' #1, featuring Saladino's logo design. Cover art by [[Bernie Wrightson]].]]

Saladino designed the logos for DC's ''[[Swamp Thing]]'', ''[[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]]'', ''[[Phantom Stranger]]'', ''[[Metal Men]]'', ''[[Adam Strange]]'', ''[[House of Mystery]]'', ''[[House of Secrets (DC Comics)|House of Secrets]]'', and ''[[Unknown Soldier (DC Comics)|Unknown Soldier]]'', among others.&lt;ref name="BDS"/&gt;&lt;ref name=13-logos&gt;[http://13thdimension.com/13-logos-a-gaspar-saladino-salute/ Images of logos by Saladino for DC and Marvel, confirmed by employees at DC, including Paul Levitz, and by the Grand Comics database]&lt;/ref&gt; He also re-designed established character logos to make them more contemporary and stylish, such as with ''[[Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Green Lantern]]''.&lt;ref name=13-logos/&gt; He also did the lettering for cover blurbs for a wide variety of titles and for seasonal house ads that ran in several issues at a time.&lt;ref name=toddklein1&gt;[http://kleinletters.com/Blog/celebrating-gaspar-saladino/ "All those pieces of art paper with Gaspar's cover lettering were stored in a few bulging folders in a file drawer in the DC production room. When I had time, I went through what was there, mostly from the late 1970s to 1985, and put together these reference pages" -- Todd Klein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toddklein2&gt;[http://kleinletters.com/Blog/celebrating-gaspar-part-2/ "Lots more terrific cover lettering from "The Master," Gaspar Saladino." -- Todd Klein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toddklein3&gt;[http://kleinletters.com/Blog/celebrating-gaspar-part-3/ "Here's the third part of the collection of wonderful cover lettering by Gaspar Saladino that I put together in 1985." -- Todd Klein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toddkelin4&gt;[http://kleinletters.com/Blog/celebrating-gaspar-part-4-final/ "This last section of my 1985 collection of stellar cover lettering by the great Gaspar Saladino also includes some from house ads." -- Todd Klein]&lt;/ref&gt;

For Marvel, Saladino's logos, which he either created or updated, include ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]'', ''[[Captain America and the Falcon]]'', and ''Marvel Triple Action''.&lt;ref name=13-logos/&gt;

In 1974, with the launch of the short-lived publisher [[Seaboard Periodicals|Atlas Comics]], Saladino designed logos for all the company's titles.&lt;ref name=GCD-Seaboard&gt;[http://www.comics.org/publisher/372/ "Gaspar Saladino did all the logos at Atlas" Alan Kupperberg in CBA #16]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s he designed logos for [[Neal Adams]]' [[Continuity Comics]] and for some titles published by [[Eclipse Comics]].&lt;ref name="BDS"/&gt;

In the 1990s he designed product logos for the Lucky Mojo Curio Company, a metaphysical supply manufactory founded by [[Catherine Yronwode]], the former editor-in-chief of Eclipse Comics.

== Lettering style ==
[[File:Saladino's lettering sample.jpg|thumb|left|350px|A panel from ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth|Arkham Asylum]]'' (story by Grant Morrison, art by Dave McKean), showing Saladino's distinctive lettering treatment.]]

Saladino's default dialoguing style was curvy and naturally enmeshed with the artwork. When producing house ads or cover blurbs, he sometimes altered the standard letterforms in order to interlock letters.&lt;ref name=toddklein3/&gt; One trademark was his use of big, bold, oversized exclamation points.&lt;ref name="BDS"&gt;{{cite web | last = Stroud | first= Bryan | url = http://www.wtv-zone.com/silverager/interviews/saladino.shtml | title = Gaspar Saladino Interview | date = 2007 | publisher = The Silver Age Sage | accessdate = July 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1970s Saladino lettered the interiors for the then-new title ''[[Swamp Thing]]''. It was in the pages of this series that he created the concept of character-designated fonts, with Swamp Thing's distinctive outlined, "drippy" letters.&lt;ref name=evanier-saladino&gt;[http://www.newsfromme.com/2016/08/04/gaspar-saladino-r-p/ "When Swamp Thing by Len Wein and Bernie Wrightson became both a financial and creative success for DC in the seventies, everyone agreed the comic wouldn't be the same without Gaspar's distinctive and expressive lettering." -- Mark Evanier]&lt;/ref&gt;

Saladino always lettered by hand. Likewise, his word balloons were drawn freehand, never with a template.&lt;ref name="BDS" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Saladino and his wife Celeste were married in 1957. At first the couple lived in [[Queens Village]], then moved to a home in [[Plainview, New York|Plainview]], [[Long Island]] in 1959, where they lived the rest of Gaspar's life. They had three children, Greg (born in 1960), Lisa (1962) and Peter (1965). At present there are five grandchildren: Jordan, Brea, Jackson, Alyssa and Kaila.&lt;ref name="klein3" /&gt; In April 2013, he was named honorary chief of the Plainview Fire Department as a 50-year member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Gaspar Saladino, 50-Year-Member, Named 'Honorary Chief' | first = Joe | last = Dowd | date = April 9, 2013 | accessdate = August 19, 2013 | url = http://plainview.patch.com/groups/police-and-fire/p/gaspar-saladino-50-year-member-named-honorary-chief | publisher = Plainview.Patch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9375">'''Hans-Peter Martin''' (born 11 August 1957) is an [[Austria]]n author and [[journalist]] and former politician who has been a [[Member of the European Parliament]] between 1999 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/search.html?country=AT|title=Advanced search for a Member {{!}} MEPs {{!}} European Parliament {{!}} Austria|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journalist and author ==

Born in [[Bregenz]], [[Vorarlberg]], Martin worked for the [[Germany|German]] weekly news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]''. As a freelance writer, he has written and co-authored several popular books, among them the best-selling ''[[The Global Trap|The Global Trap: Globalization and the Assault on Prosperity and Democracy]]'' (''Die Globalisierungsfalle'', 1996), ''Bitter Pills'' (''Bittere Pillen'') about the pros and cons of [[pharmacology|pharmaceuticals]] and ''The European Trap'' (''Die Europafalle'', only available in German but a partial translation is available on Martin's website&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpmartin.net/english/european-trap The European Trap] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409051510/http://www.hpmartin.net/english/european-trap |date=2013-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), an inside analysis of European integration, faults of the European bureaucracy and lobbyism in the EU.

The publishing house [[Penguin Random House]] released a new book by Hans-Peter Martin carrying the title ''"Game Over: Wellbeing for the few, Democracy for no one, Nationalism for all - and then?"'' in September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://service.randomhouse.de/book/Game-Over/Hans-Peter-Martin/e538698.rhd?pub=1&amp;frm=true|title=Hans-Peter Martin: Game Over. penguin (Hardcover)|isbn=9783328600237|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;''"Game over"'' was shortlisted, together with nine other books, for the best German Economic Book of the year 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/wirtschaftsbuchpreis-2018-die-besten-wirtschaftsbuecher-des-jahres/22897046.html|title=Wirtschaftsbuchpreis 2018: Die besten Wirtschaftsbücher des Jahres|website=www.handelsblatt.com|language=de|access-date=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== European Parliament 1999–2004 ==
In the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (Austria)|1999 European Parliament elections]] Martin was selected as leader of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]]'s group. However, differences with the party's leadership led to his complete break with the SPÖ.

Since then Martin has been reelected twice through his independent candidate list, [[Hans-Peter Martin's List]].

Early in 2004, he accused [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] of all parties of falsely claiming reimbursement of [[travel and subsistence]] expenses. He produced evidence of MEP's signing the register in the morning to receive their daily allowance, and then immediately leaving the building. Broadcast on German TV, the accusations caused an uproar.&lt;ref&gt;German TV program RTL Exklusiv: {{YouTube|wzEQWigzz30|MEP Hans-Peter Martin exposes an expenses scandal in the European Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then European Parliament spokesman [[Hans Gert Pöttering]] dismissed Martin's accusations as unnecessarily aggressive and the President of the Parliament [[Pat Cox]] said that he would have preferred to deal with the case internally.

In response, Martin was accused of claiming too much in meal expenses. He was later cleared of this charge.

Eventually the disclosures and the public outrage Martin's revelations induced resulted in a change of the expense system.

== European Parliament 2004–09 ==

In the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Austria)|2004 European Parliament elections]] Hans-Peter Martin decided to compete on his own party list "Hans-Peter Martin's List &amp;ndash; For genuine control and [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]] in Brussels" (''Liste Dr. Hans-Peter Martin &amp;ndash; Für echte Kontrolle in Brüssel''). For an independent he received a surprising 14% of the vote &amp;ndash; more than the [[Austrian Green Party|Greens]] or the right-wing [[Austrian Freedom Party]] &amp;ndash; and gained two of Austria's seats in the [[European Parliament]]. He has been widely credited with having reduced the vote share of the far-right parties.

The second mandate went to Austrian [[Karin Resetarits]], a former journalist with the [[ORF (broadcaster)|Austrian public broadcaster ORF]] and a private radio station. However, Martin and Resetarits soon found themselves in heavy disagreement and ceased to work together. She later joined the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe|Liberal group]] in the European Parliament on June 7, 2005 and was not reelected.

Martin's list also competed in the [[Austrian legislative election, 2006|Austrian legislative elections of 2006]], but received only 2.8% of the vote and thus was blocked from entry into the Austrian parliament by the requirement to at least have 4% of the vote. Martin explained the unexpectedly low result with accusations of "expedient but contrary to the rule" use of the secretarial allowance, which were widely publicised in the Austrian media. The later court ruling stated that Martin used the funds correctly and did not benefit from the money, but as he did not follow some formal requirements he was ordered to repay the funds. Martin argued that this was a political decision.

== European Parliament 2009–14 ==

In 2009, Martin flirted with the idea of heading a planned Austrian list of the pan-European [[euroscepticism|eurosceptical]] alliance [[Libertas.eu]], but later rebuffed Libertas' advances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austriantimes.at/index.php?id=11605 "Martin stiffs Irish ´Libertas´"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706090629/http://www.austriantimes.at/index.php?id=11605 |date=2011-07-06 }}, [[Austrian Times]], 5 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

While Libertas finally didn't manage to set up a list at all, Martin successfully competed again with his independent [[Hans-Peter Martin's List]]. He even surprised many by increasing his vote share to 18%, giving his list three seats in the European Parliament.

=== Anti-Lobbyism campaign ===

During his mandate Martin vocally campaigned for transparency and against lobbying. Since 2011 he collects and publishes all lobby invitations his office receives&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lobbyticker.eu Hans-Peter Martin's Lobby-Ticker]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2013 published an analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Presse Release on H.P. Martin's website: [http://www.hpmartin.net/english/1427-lobby-attempts-only-two-years 1427 lobby attempts in only two years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407061520/http://www.hpmartin.net/english/1427-lobby-attempts-only-two-years |date=2013-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[EUObserver]].com, 5/4/2013: [http://euobserver.com/tickers/119704 MEP registers over 1,000 lobby attempts]&lt;/ref&gt; In total Martin collected more than 1400 "lobby attempts" during the two-year timespan and published a summary table ordered by category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpmartin.net/english/spider-web-lobbyists-table In the spider web of the lobbyists - Table] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409045931/http://www.hpmartin.net/english/spider-web-lobbyists-table |date=2013-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among examples of extraordinary lobbying Martin listed were all-inclusive travels to Azerbaijan, China and Switzerland as well as free conference invitations to Cyprus and London.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Peter Martin: [http://www.hpmartin.net/english/examples-extraordinary-lobbying Examples for extraordinary lobbying] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409051652/http://www.hpmartin.net/english/examples-extraordinary-lobbying |date=2013-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He estimated the value of the two years of lobbying to up to 65,000 Euro&lt;ref&gt;[[The Economic Times|Economic Times]], 5/4/2013: [http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-04-04/news/38278607_1_european-parliament-lobbyists-afp Euro MP wants tighter rules for EU lobbyists]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Healthism''', sometimes called '''public-healthism''', is a [[neologism]] to describe a variety of [[ideology|ideological]] constructs concerning health and medicine. The term "healthism" was most likely first used by the political economist [[Robert Crawford (political economist)|Robert Crawford]], whose article "Healthism and the medicalization of everyday life"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Robert Crawford, ''Healthism and the medicalization of everyday life''. (Health:, Vol. 10, No. 4, 401-420 (2006))&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1980. In this article Crawford describes how the new political ideology, which emerged in the US during the 1970s, "[situated] the problem of health and disease at the level of the individual." The term is also known for its use in the 1994 book ''The Death of Humane Medicine and the Rise of Coercive Healthism'' by [[Petr Skrabanek]]. Skrabanek's use of "healthism", and most subsequent uses, are [[pejorative]] in intent. However, there is also a growing movement in the 21st century which see healthism as a positive empowering phenomenon which is not inherently coercive. This is exemplified through its popular uptake in the form of preventive medicine, yoga, meditation, fitness regimes, diets and the emphasis on lifestyle changes in Western society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18649">'''Information manipulation theory''' ('''IMT''') (McCornack 1992) &amp; (McCornack et al. 1992) is a way of looking at interpersonal communication. It deals with the way a  sender might assemble information packages (in the form of messages) to a receiver in order to give an impression that is false from the perspective of the sender. The sender chooses certain facts in the message from an available amount of information—but omits, alters, or falsifies others. The act of trying to get someone to believe something untrue is ''deceit''. The type of communication created by such deceitful intent is called a deceptive message. The senders management of given information to provide a receiver with a false perception of that same information is called ''information manipulation''. Departing from the focus on the communication mode found in [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] (IDT), IMT is more concerned with the content of the deceptive messages, the situational contexts that bring them about, the degree to which the detection of such a message affects perception of deception and the relational consequences associated with deceptive messages.

==History and central themes==

Information manipulation theory (IMT) was formulated by Steven A. McCornack while an assistant professor and a Lilly Endowment Teaching Fellow at Michigan State University. In 1992, McCornack published two articles that are recognized as the seminal works in information manipulation theory.  In his first article, McCornack lays out the basic foundation of this theoretical option for examining the phenomenon of creating and relaying deceptive messages. As stated, IMT “suggests that deceptive messages function deceptively because they violate the principles that govern conversational exchanges” (McCornack 1992). The second article (McCornack et al. 1992) provided an empirical test of the theory.

Timothy Levine (PhD, Michigan State University, 1992) was present for the first empirical test for information manipulation theory, has been a significant contributor to the development of IMT, and is a leader in developing new paradigms for [[deception]] detection research. IMT provided impetus to the development of a message-based theory of deception detection that calls into question psychophysical and emotion-based theories of deception detection as well as the interaction-based IDT.

==Operational context==

Information manipulation theory, not unlike [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] (IDT) is a subset and functional manifestation of interpersonal communication. According to David Buller and Judee Burgoon, “Deception is conceptualized as a form of information management, something that is fundamental to human communication (Buller &amp; Burgoon 1998).”  IMT is concerned with the way that relational goals and situational pressures influence the interpersonal communication process, and ultimately leads to the formation and implementation of deceptive verbal messages.

==Conceptual foundation==

Prior to the introduction of information manipulation theory as a potential way to observe the phenomenon of verbally controlling information there was literature on the subject of information control and deception in general. McCornack cites Turner, Edgley and Olmstead (1975) and how they “noted several forms of information control in their study of conversations (e.g. “lies,” “exaggerations,” “half-truths,” “secrets,” and diversionary responses) (McCornack et al. 1992).”  Buller and Burgoon again draw upon Turner et al. when referring to deception as “a very common form of information management in human interaction (Buller and Burgoon 1998).” With the notion of deception already being established in circles of communication studies and behavioral science as a topic of discussion and analysis by the 1980s, we have the development of conceptual constructs regarding the topic. In 1984, Hopper and Bell introduce a typology of deceptive types using English terms. The types noted in McCornack’s work are listed as follows: unlies, playings, fiction, masks, lies, and crimes (McCornack et al. 1992). In another oft-cited work from the 1980s, we are given another typology. In 1986, Metts and Chronis proposed another four types and in 1989 Metts asserted that regardless of the differences in semantics, all the “taxonomies” to date reflected a similarity in the formulation of deceptive messages. Metts states “the observable variation in deceptive message design reflects “a continuum of covert to overt misrepresentation of information.” (McCornack et al., 1992) Finally, you have [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] (IDT) introduced in 1988 by David Buller and Judee Burgoon, which proposes that deception is a distinct communicative process that relies on interaction between the sender and receiver. IDT focuses on emotion both as a motivator and message in the process as well as the mechanical aspects of how that communication takes place (Buller and Burgoon 1998).

==Theoretical perspective==

Information manipulation theory departs from [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] in the substance of the focus of its studies.  Whereas Interpersonal Deception Theory (IDT) spends more time studying the physiological challenges and channels of communication involved in the detection of deceptive messages, information manipulation theory is more involved with the content of the messages and why they are employed. This is a distinction that can be examined in terms of how these theories approach the divergence from communication norms. IDT is more involved with the physical and biological deviation of normal behavior exhibited in communication. IMT is more fixed on the departure from conversational standards. Both theories aimed at discovering more about the relational effect of discovering that an act of deception has taken place.

==Previous research==

Before the advent of information manipulation theory, researchers were not interested in the formulation or design of the deceptive message. Previous studies on deception were more concerned with the mode of communication because deception was thought to occur in typical human interactions in unnatural polarized ways. Additionally, use of recollection as a method generating “normal” cognitive examples of deception scenarios further led to this dichotomous perspective. Truth in communication was thought to be clear or unclear. Bavelas et al. (1990) speak to this issue (McCornack 1992). Deception was also viewed to have manifested as either one of two of things: a type or a strategy. McCornack sought to depart from that and present another argument for how deceptive messages might be analyzed. IMT recognizes deception as a unique mode of communication that departs from more traditional, rational communicative behavior. IMT is more directed at answering the question of how a sender might go about engaging in the development and dispensation of a deceptive message and what about that process makes it more or less deceptive (McCornack 1992).

==Theoretical framework==

Information manipulation theory proposes that in any given conversation there exists a set of basic, reasonable assumptions about how transmission of information occurs. This premise is based on the work of [[Paul Grice]]. Taken from his speeches in 1967 to writings in 1975 and 1989, Grice promoted notions regarding language usage that has come to be known as his theory of “conversational implicature” (CI) (McCornack 1992).
*''Conversational implicature''

Jacobs, Dawson and Brashers (1996) recount Grice stating “communication is made possible by communicators’ mutually orienting toward general principles of cooperation and rationality.” The vehicles that deliver CI are what Grice refers to as conversational maxims (CM).  CM can be used as dimensions to determine the degree of deceptiveness.

*''Conversational maxims''

These maxims are as follows:
# Quantity &amp;mdash; relates to expectations regarding the reasonable amount of information that should be provided in a given message
# Quality &amp;mdash; relates to expectations regarding the veracity (truthfulness) of information that is presented in a given message
# Relation &amp;mdash; relates to relevancy expectations regarding the constraints of the conversation established by earlier remarks
# Manner &amp;mdash; relates to expectations regarding the way something is said
(McCornack 1992)

*''Cooperative principle''

Grice posits that the resulting ‘norm’ that arises from adherence to CM is by virtue of what is called the Cooperative Principle (CP).

These maxims are only totally adhered to in what is called ‘a philosopher’s paradise’ but generally these maxims can be adhered to within a conversational context. Grice calls the obvious real world violation of a CM as “flouts”; when one CM opposes another, this is referred to as a “clash” (Jacobs et al. 1996).  In the case of the former this violation can happen “quietly.”
 
It is a major tenet of IMT that the subtle and covert nature of these violations of conversational norm assumptions is precisely what makes a message deceptive. A message can be identified in terms of its deceptiveness dependent on where it is measured according to the dimensions of the conversational maxims (McCornack 1992).

==Major experimental findings==

* The initial experiments regarding information manipulation theory confirmed that the degree to which a message can be determined to be deceptive can be coded and measured along the dimensions of its violations of CM. The deception by the receiver is experienced when the CP understood to occur is not adhered to by the sender. This experiment also questioned the relative social ‘competence’ of full disclosure of available information compared to social goal or consequences (McCornack et al. 1992).
* The second set of experiments measure the effect of the dimensions compared to each other. It was discovered some violations were considered “more deceptive” than others. Another discovery was that the nature of the relationship has an effect on the relative social ‘competence’ of full disclosure. In regard to romantic relationships, full disclosure is more ‘competent’ because relational honesty was considered paramount (McCornack 1992).
* Another significant experiment was performed to see if the results of McCornack’s theory could be generalized outside of Western cultures. This was examined through the lens of the individualist vs. collectivist debate. These two cultural poles are regarded as the most overarching themes of cultural identity and perspective. With the U.S. regarded as being representative of the Individualist perspective, Hong Kong was chosen to represent the Collectivist perspective. The dimensions of quality and relevance were regarded as deceptive, but not the other dimensions.  This experiment concluded that what is seen as '''truthful'', what violations are acceptable, the motivation for those violations and what is understood to be a conversational maxim is dependent on cultural identity (Yeung, Levine, &amp; Nishiyama 1999).
* Another experiment performed by L. Zhou and S. Lutterbie followed the work of the aforementioned tests of IMT. This experiment concluded that the best way to apply the principles of IMT across cultures is to take a multi-directional, multi-prong approach. This subject of normative actions in conversation should be approached with a top-down and bottom-up approach (Zhou &amp; Lutterbie 2005).

==Influential factors==

*''Cultural concept''

IMT as it is applied in cultural contexts varies. When evaluating Western culture it was discovered that all methods of manipulation were viewed as deceptive with manipulation of quality rated as most deceptive.  Conversely, IMT participants in Hong Kong only rated statements involved with quality and/or relevance as more manipulative and deceptive (Zhou &amp; Lutterbie 2005).  Both researchers agree that the Bottom-Up approach is an effective method for examining general patterns of deception across cultures while the Top-Down approach can account for situational variations to explain deceptive behavior patterns in order to create an applicable cross-cultural IMT model.

*''Moral judgment''

Research suggests young children's view of how information is perceived as deceptive varies as children grow older.  This variation in moral judgment suggests that moral development is critical in perceptions of right or wrong.  As individuals experience a series of (moral) developmental stages such as avoiding punishment, gaining rewards, identifying individual duty role in society to meet expectations of others (Zhou &amp; Lutterbie 2005), different behavior modeling criteria is established through communication situations that cognitively stimulates and challenges moral judgment. These stages, frequency and types of development models are theorized to be more or less universal across cultures.  However, moral judgment in IMT should be reserved for other communication theory that more distinctly addresses broad, generic cultural criteria patterns and specific requirements of societies to establish what does or does not covertly violate global conversational maxims.
 
*''Consequence resulting from the deceptive message''

IMT supports the idea that deception may or may not be detectable. When participants are asked to rate message features like how much information was false, omitted, equivocal and/or irrelevant, researchers can reasonably measure and describe such multidimensional deceptive messages.  However, the measurability results and conceptual meaning of degrees of deception and its impact is unclear (Levine, Asada &amp; Lindsey 2003).  Information that is manipulated on a continuum from trivial deception to important deception can range from socially acceptable to morally reprehensible.  The more severe lies are rated, the more deceptive the lies than inconsequential ones. Deceiving others about important information is more likely to result in adverse moral judgment and/or moral condemnation.

==Criticism of IMT==

The most significant criticism of information manipulation theory has come in the form of the following two arguments:

* IMT does not correctly interpret the  writings of [[Paul Grice]]'s notion of Conversational Implicature, Conversational Maxims or Cooperation Principle.  This issue was addressed in a critical rejoinder by McCornack et al. (1996).  IMT provides an explanation for the multiple ways deception can occur. However, it does not predict what conversational maxims a person may violate—only that the violation will occur within the certain realm of possibilities or scenarios provided.  IMT predicts and analyzes the methods of deception a person uses by determining what information is eliminated.
* IMT testing predictions can be made more accurate by use of a different set of information dimensions.  This issue was also addressed in the critical rejoinder by McCornack et al. (1996).  IMT is a value conscious communication theory.  The researcher must judge and develop criteria for what may be considered deceptiveness.  While violations of the maxim of quality and quantity are more or less objectively derived, violations of relation and manner are largely subjectively assessed. For this reason the researcher must be aware of his/her own bias, value and belief systems and incorporate these predispositions when making these judgments.  Researchers must also construct sound, qualitative/quantitative evaluative criteria to optimize and legitimize the integrity and credibility of their work.

'''Joel-Peter Witkin''' (born September 13, 1939) is an American [[photographer]] who lives in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]]. His work often deals with  themes such as death, corpses (and sometimes dismembered portions thereof), and various outsiders such as [[dwarfism|people with dwarfism]], [[transgender]] and [[intersex]] persons, as well as physically deformed people. Witkin's complex [[tableau vivant|tableaux]] often recall religious episodes or classical paintings.&lt;ref name="Jewish Virtual Library"/&gt;

==Biography==
Witkin was born to a [[Jewish]] father and [[Roman Catholic]] mother. His twin brother, [[Jerome Witkin]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Witkin.html Jewish Virtual Library]&lt;/ref&gt; and son Kersen Witkin, are also painters. Witkin's parents divorced when he was young because they were unable to overcome their religious differences{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. He attended grammar school at Saint Cecelia's in Brooklyn and went on to [[Grover Cleveland High School (New York City)|Grover Cleveland High School]]. In 1961 Witkin enlisted in the United States Army with the intention of capturing war photography during the [[Vietnam war]]. However, due to scheduling conflicts, Witkin never saw combat in Vietnam. Witkin spent his military time at Fort Hood, Texas, and was mostly in charge of Public Information and classified photos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtylzIiMJN0]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, he became the official photographer for City Walls Inc. He attended [[Cooper Union]] in New York, where he studied [[sculpture]], attaining a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1974.  [[Columbia University]] granted him a scholarship for graduate school, but his Master of Fine Arts degree is from the [[University of New Mexico]] in [[Albuquerque]]

Witkin claims that his vision and sensibility spring from an episode he witnessed as a young child, an automobile accident in front of his house in which a little girl was [[decapitation|decapitated]].

{{quote|It happened on a Sunday when my mother was escorting my twin brother and me down the steps of the tenement where we lived. We were going to church. While walking down the hallway to the entrance of the building, we heard an incredible crash mixed with screaming and cries for help. The accident involved three cars, all with families in them. Somehow, in the confusion, I was no longer holding my mother's hand. At the place where I stood at the curb, I could see something rolling from one of the overturned cars. It stopped at the curb where I stood. It was the head of a little girl. I bent down to touch the face, to speak to it -- but before I could touch it someone carried me away&lt;ref name="renegadeartists"&gt;{{cite web

He says his family's difficulties also influenced his work. His favorite artist is [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]. His [[photography|photographic]] techniques draw on early [[Daguerreotypes]] and on the work of [[E. J. Bellocq]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Virtual Library"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/JPWitkin.html Jewish Virtual Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

Those of Witkin's works which use corpses have had to be created in Mexico in order to get around restrictive US laws. Because of the [[Transgressive art|transgressive]] nature of the contents of his images, his works have been labelled [[wikt:exploitation|exploitative]] and have sometimes [[shock value|shocked]] public opinion.&lt;ref name="Jewish Virtual Library"/&gt;

His techniques include scratching the [[Negative (photography)|negative]], bleaching or toning the print, and using a hands-in-the-chemicals printing technique. This experimentation began after seeing a 19th-century [[ambrotype]] of a woman and her ex-lover who had been scratched from the frame.&lt;ref name="Jewish Virtual Library"/&gt;

Joel-Peter Witkin's photograph "Sanitarium" inspired the final presentation of Alexander McQueen's Spring/Summer 2001 collection based on avian imagery, the walls of another box within the faux psychiatric ward collapsed to reveal a startling tableau vivant: a reclining, masked nude breathing through a tube and surrounded by fluttering moths.

== Documentary ==
In July 2011, filming began on the feature-length documentary, [[Joel-Peter Witkin: An Objective Eye]].  The film, directed by Thomas Marino, examines Witkin's life and photographs.  Along with interviews with Joel-Peter Witkin, the film features interviews from gallery owners, prominent artists, photographers, and scholars who share insight into the impact of Witkin's work and influence on modern culture.  Filming took place in [[Albuquerque]], [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City|New York]], and [[Paris]].  The film was released on July 6, 2013 for digital download and streaming/rental.  The film will be part of the permanent collections at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris, France, and the [[Biblioteca Nacional de Chile]] in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyclopsblog.com/2011/12/02/joel-peter-witkin-an-objective-eye/ Joel-Peter Witkin: An Objective Eye |&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2326626/ Joel-Peter Witkin: An Objective Eye (2013) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Johann Jakob Moser.jpg|thumb|Johann Jacob Moser, after a painting by Johann Georg Oechslin (1775).]]

'''Johann Jakob Moser''' (18 January 1701 – 30 September 1785) was a German jurist, publicist and researcher, whose work earned him the title "The Father of German [[Constitutional Law]]" and whose political commitment to the principles of Liberalism caused him to lose academic positions and spend years as a [[political prisoner]].

==Early life==
Johann Jacob Moser was a member of the Moser family of Filseck, an old and respectable Württemberg family. They were devout Protestants with a history of service as civil servants to the Duchy of Württemberg. Moser's father was Johann Jacob Moser of Filseck (born 1660 in Stuttgart, died 1716), and his mother was Helene Catharine ''née'' Misler (born 1672 in Stade, died 1741 in Stuttgart).

Moser was born and died in [[Stuttgart]]. He had six brothers and sisters but his parents managed to fund his pursuit of an academic career. After attending [[Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Wojak | first =Irmtrud | title =Fritz Bauer 1903–1968: eine Biographie | publisher=C.H.Beck | year =2009 | location =Munich | pages =54 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=jP0uMZLuN0wC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=%22Berthold+Auerbach%22+Eberhard-Ludwigs-gymnasium| isbn =978-3-406-58154-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Moser studied state journalism at the [[University of Tübingen]]. He was mostly self-taught and at 18 years of age he became a professor of the law faculty. However he found his income insufficient, and he so that it had to look around for other possibilities. he studied at the [[University of Tübingen]], and was brilliant enough to be already at the age of 19 appointed a professor of Law in the same university.

In 1721 Moser married Friederike Rosine Vischer, daughter of a Württembergian Upper Council President. Their oldest son, [[Friedrich Karl von Moser]], was born on 18 December 1723 in Stuttgart, and became a jurist, political writer and a statesman.

From 1721-1726 he worked in Vienna. In 1724 he became an adviser to the state vice-chancellor Count Schönborn. Moser was not able to pursue a career in the imperial service, because he refused to convert to Catholicism. Soon afterwards he entered the civil service of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and was appointed as a "state adviser" in the Imperial Court. In 1726 Moser returned to Stuttgart as a government advisor. In 1727 he was appointed professor at the Tübingen Collegium. The job conflicted with his role as a government advisor and he quit (which job?) in 1732. He held a long series of administrative appointments, giving him a thorough knowledge of political and constitutional issues.

In 1736 he was called to head the Faculty of Law at the [[University of Frankfurt (Oder)]], but had to leave after three years due to his thoroughly Liberal ideas which were disliked by King [[Frederick William I of Prussia]]. Between 1739 and 1751, he had various jobs.

He spent the years 1739 to 1747 at [[Ebersdorf, Saalburg-Ebersdorf|Ebersdorf]], mainly concerned with completing the monumental 53 volumes of his ''Deutsches Staatsrecht'' ("German Constitutional Law"), a pioneering research analysing the named subject matter more systematically than ever done before, and based on a through study of the sources.

In 1751 Moser became a consultant on land reform to the [[Charles Eugene, Duke of Württemberg]]. He came into conflict with the Duke by opposing the Duke's [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutist]] tendencies. In July 1759 he was arrested and imprisoned without judicial procedure in solitary confinement in the fortress [[Hohentwiel]], on the charge of authoring subversive writings. He completed his five-year detention with his mental and physical health and his faith in god unbroken. In order to meet his desire to write, without writing materials, he wrote religious songs on the walls with soot from the fireplace on the walls. In 1764, aged 63, he was released, in part due to the intercession of Friedrich the Great of Prussia, and was rehabilitated and restored to his position, rank and titles.

In 1764 he was released, due in part to the intercession of [[Friedrich the Great]] of Prussia (son of the king who had hounded Moser in 1739). He was rehabilitated and restored to his position, rank and titles. He retired on 16 July 1770 aged 69. During the next 15 years, he wrote many books. Over his entire life he wrote 500-600 books. This prolific output led sometimes to careless representations of the facts in his works.

==Legacy==
Johann Jacob Moser wrote the first description of the German state based not on abstract principles but on concrete legal rules and judicial decisions. He collected material and organised it systematically. Thus he argued against the deductive systems of natural law advocated by [[Christian Thomasius]] (1655-1728) and [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] (1679-1754). He gave the same treatment to international law, describing how it was actually practiced, rather than attempting to derive it from nature. Moser is considered as laying the foundations for the modern German state and positive international law. He defended the traditional order by defending actual legal rules.

Apart from his work on state law, he was also interested in the local law of the numerous territories of the state. However, because of their great variety, he was not able to describe them with the same comprehensiveness.

Among his important later works can be mentioned ''Neues deutsches Staatsrecht'', ("New German Constitutional Law"), published in 24 volumes between 1766 and 1782. His overall ouvre includes about 500 works, on law as well as [[theology]].

'''Krak des Chevaliers''' ({{IPA-fr|kʁak de ʃəvaˈlje}}; {{lang-ar|حصن الفرسان}}), also '''Crac des Chevaliers''', '''Ḥoṣn al-Akrād''' ({{lang|ar|حصن الأكراد|rtl=yes}}, literally  "Castle of the Kurds"), formerly '''Crac de l'Ospital''' is a [[List of Crusader castles|Crusader castle]] in [[Syria]] and one of the most important preserved medieval castles in the world. The site was first inhabited in the 11th&amp;nbsp;century by a settlement of [[Kurds|Kurdish]] troops garrisoned there by the [[Mirdasid dynasty|Mirdasids]]. As a result, it was known as ''Hisn al-Akrad'', meaning the "Castle of the Kurds". In 1142 it was given by [[Raymond II of Tripoli|Raymond II]], [[County of Tripoli|Count of Tripoli]], to the [[Knights Hospitaller]]. It remained in their possession until it fell in 1271. It became known as ''Crac de l'Ospital''; the name ''Krak des Chevaliers'' was coined in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century.

The Hospitallers began rebuilding the [[castle]] in the 1140s and were finished by 1170 when an [[earthquake]] damaged the castle. The order controlled a number of castles along the border of the [[County of Tripoli]], a [[Crusader state|state]] founded after the [[First Crusade]]. Krak des Chevaliers was among the most important, and acted as a center of administration as well as a military base. After a second phase of building was undertaken in the 13th&amp;nbsp;century, Krak des Chevaliers became a [[concentric castle]]. This phase created the outer wall and gave the castle its current appearance. The first half of the century has been described as Krak des Chevaliers' "golden age". At its peak, Krak des Chevaliers housed a garrison of around 2,000. Such a large garrison allowed the Hospitallers to [[tribute|exact tribute]] from a wide area. From the 1250s the fortunes of the Knights Hospitaller took a turn for the worse and in 1271 [[Mamluk]] Sultan [[Baibars]] captured Krak des Chevaliers after a siege lasting 36&amp;nbsp;days, supposedly by way of a forged letter purportedly from the Hospitallers' Grand Master that caused the Knights to surrender.

Renewed interest in [[List of Crusader castles|Crusader castles]] in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century led to the investigation of Krak des Chevaliers, and architectural plans were drawn up. In the late 19th or early 20th&amp;nbsp;century a settlement had been created within the castle, causing damage to its fabric. The 500&amp;nbsp;inhabitants were moved in 1933 and the castle was given over to the French state, which carried out a program of clearing and restoration. When Syria declared independence in 1946, it assumed control. 

Today, a village called [[al-Husn, Syria|al-Husn]] exists around the castle and has a population of nearly 9,000. Krak des Chevaliers is located approximately {{convert|40|km}} west of the city of [[Homs]], close to the border of [[Lebanon]], and is administratively part of the [[Homs Governorate]]. Since [[List of World Heritage Sites by year of inscription#2006 (30th session)|2006]], the castles of Krak des Chevaliers and [[Citadel of Salah Ed-Din|Qal'at Salah El-Din]] have been recognised by [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Site]]s.&lt;ref name=WHS&gt;{{citation |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1229 |title=Crac des Chevaliers and Qal’at Salah El-Din |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was partially damaged in the [[Syrian civil war]] from [[Artillery|shelling]] and recaptured by the Syrian government forces in 2014. Since then, reconstruction and conservation work on the site had begun. Reports by the UNESCO and the Syrian government on the state of the site are produced yearly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1229/documents/ UNESCO and Syrian government documents related to the monument site.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The modern [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for a castle is ''Kalaa'' ({{lang|ar|قلعة|rtl=yes}}), but Krak des Chavaliers is known as a "''Hosn''" ({{lang|ar|حصن|rtl=yes}}), or "fort". This derives from the name of an earlier fortification on the same site called ''Ḥoṣn al-Akrād'' ({{lang|ar|حصن الأكراد|rtl=yes}}), meaning "fort of the Kurds".&lt;ref name="Cathcart King 83"&gt;{{harvnb|King|1949|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was called by the [[Franks]] {{lang|fr|Le Crat}} and then by a confusion with ''karak'' (fortress), {{lang|fr|Le Crac}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Setton|Hazard|1977|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Crat'' was probably the Frankish version of ''Akrād'', the word for Kurds. After the Knights Hospitaller took control of the castle, it became known as {{lang|fr|Crac de l'Ospital}}; the name {{lang|fr|Crac des Chevaliers}} (alternatively spelt {{lang|fr|Krak des Chevaliers}}) was introduced by Guillaume Rey in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="Kennedy note4"&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|p=146}}, n.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Krak des Chevaliers landscape (cropped).jpg|thumb|Krak des Chevaliers overlooking the surrounding area.]]
The castle sits atop a {{convert|650|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} hill east of [[Tartus, Syria|Tartus]], [[Syria]], in the [[Homs Gap]].&lt;ref name="Lepage 77"&gt;{{harvnb|Lepage|2002|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other side of the gap, {{convert|27|km}} away, was the 12th-century [[Gibelacar|Gibelacar Castle]] (Hisn Ibn Akkar).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The route through the strategically important Homs Gap connects the cities of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] and Homs. To the north of the castle lies the [[Jebel Ansariyah]], and to the south [[Lebanon]]. The surrounding area is fertile,&lt;ref name="Cathcart King 83"/&gt; benefiting from streams and abundant rainfall.&lt;ref name=Kennedy145-6&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|pp=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], the other Crusader states had less land suitable for farming; however, the limestone peaks of Tripoli were well-suited to defensive sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Property in the County of Tripoli, granted to the Knights in the 1140s, included the Krak des Chevaliers, the towns of [[Rhaphanaea|Rafanea]] and [[Baarin|Montferrand]], and the [[Beqaa Valley|Beqa'a plain]] separating Homs and Tripoli. Homs was never under Crusader control, so the region around the Krak des Chevaliers was vulnerable to expeditions from the city. While its proximity caused the Knights problems with regard to defending their territory, it also meant Homs was close enough for them to raid. Because of the castle's command of the plain, it became the Knights' most important base in the area.&lt;ref name=Kennedy145-6/&gt;

According to the 13th-century Arab historian [[Izz al-Din ibn Shaddad|Ibn Shaddad]], in 1031, the [[Mirdasid dynasty|Mirdasid]] emir of [[Aleppo]] and Homs, [[Shibl al-Dawla Nasr|Shibl ad-Dawla Nasr]], established a settlement of [[Kurds|Kurdish]] tribesmen at the site of the castle,&lt;ref name="Salibi 27"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salibi|first1=Kamal S.|title=The Sayfās and the Eyalet of Tripoli 1579-1640|journal=Arabica|date=February 1973|volume=20|issue=1|page=27|jstor=4056003|publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was then known as "''Ḥiṣn al-Safḥ''".&lt;ref name="Salibi 108"&gt;{{harvnb|Salibi|1977|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nasr restored Hisn al-Safh to help reestablish the Mirdasids' access to the coast of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] after they lost nearby [[Gibelacar|Hisn Ibn Akkar]] to the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]]s in 1029.&lt;ref name="Salibi 108"/&gt; Due to Nasr's garrisoning of Kurdish troops at the site, the castle became known as "''Ḥiṣn al-Akrād''" (Castle of the Kurds).&lt;ref name="Salibi 27"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Salibi 108"/&gt; The castle was strategically located at the southern edge of the [[Syrian Coastal Mountain Range|Jibal al-Alawiyin]] mountain range and dominated the road between Homs and Tripoli.&lt;ref name="Salibi 27"/&gt; When building castles, engineers often chose elevated sites, such as hills and mountains, that provided natural obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1099 on the journey to [[Jerusalem]] during the [[First Crusade]], the company of [[Raymond IV of Toulouse]] came under attack from the garrison of Hisn al-Akrad, the forerunner of the Krak, who harried Raymond's foragers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|France|1997|p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day Raymond marched on the castle and found it deserted. The crusaders briefly occupied the castle in February of the same year but abandoned it when they continued their march towards Jerusalem. Permanent occupation began in 1110 when [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee]] took control of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spiteri|2001|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early castle was substantially different from the extant remains and no trace of this first castle survives at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boas|1999|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] are unclear, but the order probably emerged around the 1070s in Jerusalem. It started as a [[religious order]] which cared for the sick, and later looked after pilgrims to the Holy Land. After the success of the First Crusade in [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|capturing Jerusalem in 1099]], many crusaders donated their new property in the [[Levant]] to the Hospital of St John. Early donations were in the newly formed [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], but over time the order extended its holdings to the [[Crusader state]]s of the [[County of Tripoli]] and the [[Principality of Antioch]]. Evidence suggests that in the 1130s the order became militarised&lt;ref name=Nicolson3-10&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|2001|pp=3–4, 8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Fulk, King of Jerusalem]], granted the newly built castle at [[Beth Gibelin]] to the order in 1136.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barber|1995|pp=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[papal bull]] from between 1139 and 1143 may indicate the order hiring people to defend pilgrims. There were also other [[Military order (society)|military order]]s, such as the [[Knights Templar]], which offered protection to pilgrims.&lt;ref name=Nicolson3-10/&gt;

[[File:Castilla-de-Ulysses-el-Reyes.jpg|thumb|Artist rendering of Krak des Chevaliers seen from the northeast. From Guillaume Rey ''Étude sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des croisés en Syrie et dans l'île de Chypre'' (1871).]]
Between 1142 and 1144 [[Raymond II of Tripoli|Raymond&amp;nbsp;II]], Count of Tripoli, granted the order property in the county.&lt;ref name=Nicholson11&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|2001|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]], the Hospitallers effectively established a "palatinate" within Tripoli.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barber|1995|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The property included castles with which the Hospitallers were expected to defend Tripoli. Along with Krak des Chevaliers, the Hospitallers were given four other castles along the borders of the state which allowed the order to dominate the area. The order's agreement with Raymond&amp;nbsp;II stated that if he did not accompany knights of the order on campaign, the spoils belonged entirely to the order, and if he was present it was split equally between the count and the order. Raymond&amp;nbsp;II could further not make peace with the Muslims without the permission of the Hospitallers.&lt;ref name=Nicholson11/&gt; The Hospitallers made Krak des Chevaliers a center of administration for their new property, undertaking work at the castle that would make it one of the most elaborate Crusader fortifications in the Levant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After acquiring the site in 1142, they began building a new castle to replace the former Kurdish fortification. This work lasted until 1170, when an earthquake damaged the castle. An Arab source mentions that the quake destroyed the [[castle's chapel]], which was replaced by the present chapel.&lt;ref name=Kennedy150&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1163 the Crusaders emerged victorious over [[Nur ad-Din Zengi|Nur ad-Din]] in the [[Battle of al-Buqaia]] near Krak des Chevaliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barber|1995|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drought conditions between 1175 and 1180 prompted the Crusaders to sign a two-year truce with the Muslims, but without Tripoli included in the terms. During the 1180s, raids by Christians and Muslims into each other's territory became more frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ellenblum|2007|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1180, Saladin ventured into the County of Tripoli, ravaging the area. Unwilling to meet him in open battle, the Crusaders retreated to the relative safety of their fortifications. Without capturing the castles, Saladin could not secure control of the area, and once he retreated the Hospitallers were able to revitalise their damaged lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|pp=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Battle of Hattin]] in 1187 was a disastrous defeat for the Crusaders: [[Guy of Lusignan]], King of Jerusalem, was captured, as was the [[True Cross]], a relic discovered during the First Crusade. Afterwards Saladin ordered the execution of the captured Templar and Hospitaller knights, such was the importance of the two orders in defending the Crusader states.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|2001|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the battle, the Hospitaller castles of [[Suba, Jerusalem|Belmont]], [[Belvoir Fortress (Israel)|Belvoir]], and Bethgibelin fell to Muslim armies. Following these losses, the Order focused its attention on its castles in Tripoli.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1188 Saladin led an army to attack Krak des Chevaliers, but on seeing the castle decided it was too well defended and instead marched on the Hospitaller castle of [[Margat]], which he also failed to capture.&lt;ref name=Kennedy147&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another earthquake [[1202 Syria earthquake|struck in 1202]], and it may have been after this event that the castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave it its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle's inner court or ward. If there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current outer walls, no trace of it has been discovered.&lt;ref name=Kennedy152-153&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|pp=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- In 1217, during the [[Fifth Crusade]], King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] strengthened the outer walls and financed the guarding troops.--&gt;

[[File:Krak Cutaway.png|500px|right|Cutaway section of the Krak from south to north]]

The first half of the 13th&amp;nbsp;century has been characterised as Krak des Chevaliers' "golden age". While other Crusader strongholds came under threat, Krak des Chevaliers and its garrison of 2,000&amp;nbsp;soldiers dominated the surrounding area. It was effectively the center of a principality which remained in Crusader hands until 1271 and was the only major inland area to remain constantly under Crusader control during this period. Crusaders who passed through the area would often stop at the castle, and probably made donations. King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] visited in 1218 and proclaimed the castle the "key of the Christian lands". He was so impressed with the castle that he gave a yearly income of 60&amp;nbsp;[[mark (money)|marks]] to the Master and 40&amp;nbsp;to the brothers. [[Geoffrey V of Joinville|Geoffroy de Joinville]], uncle of the noted chronicler of the Crusades [[Jean de Joinville]], died at Krak des Chevaliers in 1203 or 1204 and was buried in the castle's chapel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|pp=147–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main contemporary accounts relating to Krak des Chevaliers are of Muslim origin and tend to emphasise Muslim success while overlooking setbacks against the Crusaders although they suggest that the Knights Hospitaller forced the settlements of [[Hama]] and Homs to pay [[tribute]] to the Order. This situation lasted as long as Saladin's successors warred between themselves. The proximity of Krak des Chevaliers to Muslim territories allowed it to take on an offensive role, acting as a base from which neighboring areas could be attacked. By 1203 the garrison were making raids on Montferrand (which was under Muslim control) and Hama, and in 1207 and 1208 the castle's soldiers took part in an attack on Homs. Krak des Chevaliers acted as a base for expeditions to Hama in 1230 and 1233 after the [[emir|amir]] refused to pay tribute. The former was unsuccessful, but the 1233 expedition was a show of force that demonstrated the importance of Krak des Chevaliers.&lt;ref name=Kennedy147/&gt;

[[File:Krak des chavaliers plaine.jpg|thumb|The area between the inner and outer walls is narrow and was not used for accommodation.]]

In the 1250s, the fortunes of the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers took a turn for the worse. A Muslim army estimated to number 10,000&amp;nbsp;men ravaged the countryside around the castle in 1252 after which the Order's finances declined sharply. In 1268 Master [[Hugh Revel]] complained that the area, previously home to around 10,000&amp;nbsp;people, now stood deserted and that the Order's property in the Kingdom of Jerusalem produced little income. He also noted that by this point there were only 300 of the Order's brethren left in the east. On the Muslim side, in 1260 [[Baibars]] became Sultan of Egypt, following his overthrow of the incumbent ruler [[Qutuz]], and went on to unite Egypt and Syria. As a result, Muslim settlements that had previously paid tribute to the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers no longer felt intimidated into doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baibars ventured into the area around Krak des Chevaliers in 1270 and allowed his men to graze their animals on the fields around the castle. When he received news that year of the [[Eighth Crusade]] led by King [[Louis IX of France]], Baibars left for [[Cairo]] to avoid a confrontation. After Louis died in 1271 Baibars returned to deal with Krak des Chevaliers. Before he marched on the castle the Sultan captured the smaller castles in the area, including [[Chastel Blanc]]. On 3&amp;nbsp;March, Baibars' army arrived at Krak des Chevaliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|pp=148–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the Sultan appeared on the scene, the castle may already have been blockaded by [[Mamluk]] forces for several days.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1949|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the three Arabic accounts of the siege only one was contemporary, that of Ibn Shaddad, although he was not present at the siege. Peasants who lived in the area had fled to the castle for safety and were kept in the outer ward. As soon as Baibars arrived he erected [[mangonel]]s, powerful siege weapons which he would later turn on the castle. In a probable reference to a walled suburb outside the castle's entrance, Ibn Shaddad records that two days later the first line of defences fell to the besiegers.&lt;ref name=King88-92&gt;{{harvnb|King|1949|pp=88–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rain interrupted the siege, but on 21&amp;nbsp;March, immediately south of Krak des Chevaliers, Baibar's forces captured a triangular [[outwork]] possibly defended by a timber [[palisade]]. On 29&amp;nbsp;March, the attackers [[Mining (military)|undermined]] a tower in the southwest corner causing it to collapse whereupon Baibars' army attacked through the breach. In the outer ward they encountered the peasants who had sought refuge in the castle. Though the outer ward had fallen, with a handful of the garrison killed in the process, the Crusaders retreated to the more formidable inner ward. After a lull of ten days, the besiegers conveyed a letter to the garrison, supposedly from the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller in Tripoli, which granted permission for them to surrender. Although the letter was a forgery, the garrison capitulated and the Sultan spared their lives.&lt;ref name=King88-92/&gt; The new owners of the castle undertook repairs, focused mainly on the outer ward.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1949|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hospitaller chapel was converted to a [[mosque]] and two ''[[mihrab]]s'' (prayer niches) were added to the interior.&lt;ref name=FFC179&gt;{{harvnb|Folda|French|Coupel|1982|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Franks were driven from the Holy Land in 1291, European familiarity with the castles of the Crusades declined. It was not until the 19th&amp;nbsp;century that interest in these buildings was renewed, so there are no detailed plans from before 1837. Guillaume Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles in the Holy Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871 he published the work ''Etudes sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l'ile de Chypre''; it included plans and drawings of the major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances his drawings were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Deschamps visited the castle in February 1927. Since Rey had visited in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century a village of 500&amp;nbsp;people had been established within the castle. Renewed inhabitation had damaged the site: underground vaults had been used as rubbish tips and in some places the battlements had been destroyed. Deschamps and fellow architect François Anus attempted to clear some of the detritus; General [[Maurice Gamelin]] assigned 60 [[Alawi]]te soldiers to help. Deschamps left in March 1927, and work resumed when he returned two years later. The culmination of Deschamp's work at the castle was the publication of ''Les Châteaux des Croisés en Terre Sainte I: le Crac des Chevaliers'' in 1934, with detailed plans by Anus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey has been widely praised, described as "brilliant and exhaustive" by military historian D. J. Cathcart King in 1949&lt;ref name="Cathcart King 83"/&gt; and "perhaps the finest account of the archaeology and history of a single medieval castle ever written" by historian [[Hugh N. Kennedy|Hugh Kennedy]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="Kennedy note4"/&gt;

As early as 1929 there were suggestions that the castle should be taken under French control. On 16&amp;nbsp;November 1933 Krak des Chevaliers was given into the control of the French state, and cared for by the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]]. The villagers were moved and paid [[Franc|F]]1&amp;nbsp;million between them in compensation. Over the following two years a programme of cleaning and restoration was carried out by a force of 120&amp;nbsp;workers. Once finished, Krak des Chevaliers was one of the key tourist attractions in the French Levant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Coupel, who had undertaken similar work at the [[Lion Tower|Tower of the Lions]] and the two castles at [[Sidon]], supervised the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Albright|1936|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the restoration, no [[excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavations]] were carried out. The [[French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon]], which had been established in 1920, ended in 1946 with the declaration of Syrian independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle was made a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]], along with [[Citadel of Salah Ed-Din|Qal’at Salah El-Din]], in 2006,&lt;ref name="WHS"/&gt; and is owned by the Syrian government.

During the [[Syrian Civil War]] which began in 2011, UNESCO voiced concerns that the war might lead to the damage of important cultural sites such as Krak des Chevaliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/862 |title=Director-General of UNESCO appeals for protection of Syria’s cultural heritage |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |date=2012-03-30 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that the castle was [[Artillery|shelled]] in August 2012 by the [[Syrian Army|Syrian Arab Army]], and the Crusader chapel has been damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/fisk/robert-fisk-syrias-ancient-treasures-pulverised-8007768.html| title=Robert Fisk: Syria's ancient treasures pulverised| publisher=The Independent| date=2012-08-05| accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle was reported to have been damaged in July 2013 by an [[Syrian Arab Air Force|airstrike]] during the [[Siege of Homs]],&lt;ref name="Air strike  2013"&gt;{{cite news| title=Latest victim of Syria air strikes: Famed Krak des Chevaliers castle| url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=60073| accessdate=14 July 2013| newspaper=Middle East Online| date=13 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and once more on 18 August 2013 it was clearly damaged yet the amount of destruction is unknown.

==Architecture==
[[File:Krak des chevaliers - plan.jpg|thumb|Plan of Krak des Chevaliers from Guillaume Rey ''Étude sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des croisés en Syrie et dans l'île de Chypre'' (1871). North is on the right.]]
[[File:Krak des Chevaliers 22.jpg|thumb|The inner court seen from the south]]
[[File:Hall of the Knights - Krak des Chevaliers.jpg|thumb|Hall of the knights, 2009]]
Writing in the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century, [[T. E. Lawrence]], popularly known as Lawrence of Arabia, remarked that Krak des Chevaliers was "perhaps the best preserved and most wholly admirable castle in the world, [a castle which] forms a fitting commentary on any account of the Crusading buildings of Syria".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|DeVries|1992|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castles in Europe provided lordly accommodation for their owners and were centers of administration; in the Levant the need for defence was paramount and was reflected in castle design. Kennedy suggests that "The castle scientifically designed as a fighting machine surely reached its apogee in great buildings like [[Margat]] and Crac des Chevaliers."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krak des Chevaliers can be classified both as a [[spur castle]], due to its site, and after the 13th-century expansion a fully developed [[concentric castle]]. It was similar in size and layout to [[Battle of Jacob's Ford|Vadum Jacob]], a Crusader castle built in the late 1170s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boas|1999|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margat has also been cited as Krak des Chevaliers' sister castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main building material at Krak des Chevaliers was [[limestone]]; the [[ashlar]] facing is so fine that the [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] is barely noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the castle's entrance was a "walled suburb" known as a ''[[burgus]]'', no trace of which remains. To the south of the outer ward was a triangular [[outwork]] and the Crusaders may have intended to build stone walls and towers around it. It is unknown how it was defended at the time of the 1271 siege, though it has been suggested it was surrounded by a timber [[palisade]].&lt;ref name=King88&gt;{{harvnb|King|1949|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; South of the castle the spur on which it stands is connected to the next hill, so that [[siege engine]]s can approach on level ground. The inner defences are strongest at this point, with a cluster of towers connected by a thick wall.

===Inner ward===
Between 1142 and 1170 the Knights Hospitaller undertook a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]] studded with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was between two towers on the eastern side, and there was a [[postern]] gate in the northwest tower. At the center was a courtyard surrounded by [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] chambers. The lay of the land dictated the castle's irregular shape. A site with natural defences was a typical location for Crusader castles and steep slopes provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one, where the castle's defences were concentrated. This phase of building was incorporated into the later castle's construction.&lt;ref name=Kennedy150/&gt;

When Krak des Chevaliers was remodelled in the 13th&amp;nbsp;century, new walls surrounding the inner court were built. They followed the earlier walls, with a narrow gap between them in the west and south which was turned into a gallery from which defenders could unleash missiles. In this area, the walls were supported by a steeply sloping [[glacis]] which provided additional protection against both siege weapons and earthquakes. Four large, round towers project vertically from the glacis; they were used as accommodation for the Knights of the garrison, about 60 at its peak. The southwest tower was designed to house the rooms of the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller. Though the defences which once crested the walls of the inner wards no longer survive in most places, it seems that they did not extend for the entire circuit. Machicolations were absent from the southern face. The area between the inner court and the outer walls was narrow and not used for accommodation. In the east, where the defences were weakest, there was an open [[cistern]] filled by an aqueduct. It acted both as a moat and water supply for the castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|pp=158–161, 163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the north end of the small courtyard is a chapel and at the southern end is an [[esplanade]]. The esplanade is raised above the rest of the courtyard; the vaulted area beneath it would have provided storage and could have acted as stabling and shelter from missiles. Lining the west of the courtyard is the hall of the Knights. Though probably first built in the 12th&amp;nbsp;century, the interior dates from the 13th-century remodelling. The [[tracery]] and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of [[Gothic architecture]], probably dating from the 1230s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|pp=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapel===
[[File:Chapel of Krak des Chevaliers 05.jpg|thumb|upright|The west end of the chapel]]
The current [[chapel]] was probably built to replace the one destroyed by an earthquake in 1170.&lt;ref name=Kennedy150/&gt; Only the east end of the original chapel, which housed the apse, and a small part of the south wall survive from the original chapel.&lt;ref name=FFC179/&gt; The later chapel had a [[barrel vault]] and an uncomplicated [[apse]]; its design would have been considered outmoded by contemporary standards in France, but bears similarities to that built around 1186 at Margat.&lt;ref name=Kennedy150/&gt; It was divided into three roughly equal bays. A [[cornice]] runs round the chapel at the point where the vault ends and the wall begins. Oriented roughly east to west, it was {{convert|21.5|m}} long and {{convert|8.5|m}} wide with the main entrance from the west and a second smaller one in the north wall. When the castle was remodelled in the early 13th&amp;nbsp;century, the entrance was moved to the south wall. The chapel was lit by windows above the cornice, one at the west end, one on either side of the east bay, and one on the south side of the central bay, and the apse at the east end had a large window. In 1935 a second chapel was discovered outside the castle's main entrance, however it no longer survives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Folda|French|Coupel|1982|pp=178–179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outer ward===
[[File:Krak des chevaliers inscription latine.jpg|thumb|''Sit tibi copia, sit sapientia, formaque detur; Inquinat omnia sola superbia, si comitetur''.&lt;br /&gt; Translation:&lt;br /&gt;You may have bounty, you may have wisdom, you may be granted beauty; pride alone defiles all [these things] if it is committed.]]
The second phase of building work undertaken by the Hospitallers began in the early 13th&amp;nbsp;century and lasted decades. The outer walls were built in the last major construction on the site, lending the Krak des Chevaliers its current appearance. Standing {{convert|9|m}} high, the outer circuit had towers that projected strongly from the wall. While the towers of the inner court had a square plan and did not project far beyond the wall, the towers of the 13th-century outer walls were rounded. This design was new and even contemporary Templar castles did not have rounded towers.&lt;ref name=Kennedy152-153/&gt; The technique was developed at [[Château Gaillard]] in France by [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] between 1196 and 1198.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|2004|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extension to the southeast is of lesser quality than the rest of the circuit and was built at an unknown date. Probably around the 1250s a postern was added to the north wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arrow slit]]s in the walls and towers were distributed to minimise the amount of [[enfilade and defilade|dead ground]] around the castle. [[Machicolation]]s crowned the walls, offering defenders a way to hurl projectiles towards enemies at the foot of the wall. They were so cramped archers would have had to crouch inside them. The box machicolations were unusual: those at Krak des Chevaliers were more complex that those at [[Citadel of Salah Ed-Din|Saône]] or Margat and there were no comparable features amongst Crusader castles. However, they bore similarities to Muslim work, such as the contemporary defences at the [[Citadel of Aleppo]]. It is unclear which side imitated the other, as the date they were added to Krak des Chevaliers is unknown, but it does provide evidence for the diffusion of military ideas between the Muslim and Christian armies. These defences were accessed by a wall-walk known as a [[chemin de ronde]]. In the opinion of historian Hugh Kennedy the defences of the outer wall were "the most elaborate and developed anywhere in the Latin east&amp;nbsp;... the whole structure is a brilliantly designed and superbly built fighting machine".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|pp=153–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the outer walls were built in the 13th&amp;nbsp;century the main entrance was enhanced. A vaulted corridor led uphill from the outer gate in the northeast.&lt;ref name=King87&gt;{{harvnb|King|1949|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corridor made a hairpin turn halfway along its length, making it an example of a [[bent entrance]]. Bent entrances were a Byzantine innovation, but that at Krak des Chevaliers was a particularly complex example.&lt;ref name=Kennedy157-8&gt;{{harvnb|Kennedy|1994|pp=157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; It extended for {{convert|137|m|-1}}, and along its length were [[murder-hole]]s which allowed defenders to shower attackers with missiles.&lt;ref name=King87/&gt; Anyone going straight ahead rather than following the hairpin turn would emerge in the area between the castle's two circuits of walls. To access the inner ward, the passage had to be followed round.&lt;ref name=Kennedy157-8/&gt;

===Frescoes===
[[File:Chapel of Krak des Chevaliers 04.jpg|thumb|Remains of medieval frescoes in the castle's chapel]]
Despite its predominantly military character, the castle is one of the few sites where [[Crusader art]] (in the form of [[fresco]]es) has been preserved. In 1935, 1955, and 1978 medieval frescoes were discovered within Krak des Chevaliers after later plaster and white-wash had decayed. The frescos were painted on the interior and exterior of the main chapel and the chapel outside the main entrance, which no longer survives. Writing in 1982, historian [[Jaroslav Folda]] noted that at the time there had been little investigation of Crusader frescoes that would provide a comparison for the fragmentary remains found at Krak des Chevaliers. Those in the chapel were painted on the masonry from the 1170–1202 rebuild. Mold, smoke, and moisture have made it difficult to preserve the frescoes. The fragmentary nature of the red and blue frescoes inside the chapel means they are difficult to assess. The one on the exterior of the chapel depicted the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Folda|French|Coupel|1982|pp=178–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3441">The term '''legal transplant''' was coined in the 1970s by the Scottish-American legal scholar [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|W.A.J. 'Alan' Watson]] to indicate the moving of a rule or a [[system of law]] from one country to another (A. Watson, ''Legal Transplants: An Approach to [[Comparative Law]]'', [[Edinburgh]], 1974). The notion of legal transplantation is [[diffusionism]]-based and according to this concept most changes in most legal systems occur as the result of borrowing. As maintained by [[Alan Watson (legal scholar)|Watson]], transplantation is the most fertile source of legal development.

Laws are commonly inspired by foreign policies and experiences. Regardless of the academic discourses on whether legal transplants are sustainable as a notion in the [[law|legal theory]], they are common practice. Nevertheless, the degree to which new laws are inspired by foreign examples can vary. A frequent and often justified criticism is that imported laws are not suited for a certain local context.

German jurist [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] and his [[German Historical School|historical school of jurisprudence]], which was inspired by the 19th-century [[Romanticism]], have notably promoted the origins of the [[German people]] and their distinctive [[ethos]], or [[Volksgeist]] (“the spirit of a people”). Savigny’s school of legal thought expressed the need of legal change to respect the continuity of the Volksgeist offering a pre-Darwinian concept of juristic evolution. However, this concept of juristic evolution did not leave much space for notions such as legal transplants and the diffusion of law. More recently, Pierre Legrand is one of the strongest opponents of legal transplants.

Today, legal transplants are often mentioned in the broader process of '''diffusion of law''' or '''legal [[acculturation]]'''. J.W. Powell is credited with coining the word “acculturation”, first using it in an 1880 report by the US Bureau of American [[Ethnography]]. He explained that this term refers to the [[psychology|psychological]] changes induced by [[cross-cultural]] [[imitation]]. In a broader context, such notion is by many contemporary scholars applied to legal thought. The diffusion of law is a process of legal change in today’s age of [[globalization]]. Studies on diffusion of law are notably a new area of research in the 21st century.

This is a list of '''''Whaling Walls''''', which are large outdoor [[mural]]s by the artist [[Robert Wyland]], featuring images of life-size [[gray whale]]s, breaching [[humpback whale]]s, [[blue whale]]s, and other sea life. ''Whaling Walls'' (a pun on the [[Wailing Wall]]) are created by invitation of the communities, institutions, and building owners of the structures on which they are painted. The one hundredth and possibly final ''Whaling Wall'' was painted in [[Beijing]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[[Environment News Service|ENS]] (27 June 2008).

'''Literary theory''' in a strict sense is the systematic [[research|study]] of the nature of [[literature]] and of the methods for [[literary analysis | analyzing literature]].&lt;ref name="Culler 1997, p.1"&gt;Culler 1997, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; However, literary scholarship since the 19th century often includes—in addition to, or even instead of literary theory in the strict sense—considerations of [[intellectual history]], moral philosophy, social prophecy, and other interdisciplinary themes which are of relevance to the way humans interpret [[meaning (disambiguation) | meaning]].&lt;ref name="Culler 1997, p.1"/&gt; In the [[humanities]] in modern academia, the latter style of scholarship is an outgrowth of [[critical theory]] and is often called{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} simply "theory".&lt;ref name="Searle"&gt;
Searle, John. (1990) "The Storm Over the University", ''The New York Review of Books'', December 6, 1990.
&lt;/ref&gt;
As a consequence, the word "theory" has become an umbrella term for a variety of scholarly approaches to reading [[text (literary theory) | text]]s. Many of these approaches are informed by various strands of [[Continental philosophy]] and of [[sociology]].

==History==
The practice of literary theory became a profession in the 20th century, but it has historical roots that run as far back as ancient Greece ([[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' is an often cited early example), ancient India ([[Bharata Muni]]'s ''[[Natya Shastra]]''), ancient Rome ([[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]'s ''On the Sublime'') and medieval Iraq ([[Al-Jahiz]]'s ''al-Bayan wa-'l-tabyin'' and ''al-Hayawan'', and [[Abdullah ibn al-Mu'tazz|ibn al-Mu'tazz]]'s ''Kitab al-Badi'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Beyond the Line: Classical Arabic Literary Critics on the Coherence and Unity of the Poem|first=G. J. H.|last=van Gelder|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1982|isbn=90-04-06854-6|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[aesthetic]] theories of [[philosopher]]s from [[ancient philosophy]] through the 18th and 19th centuries are important influences on current literary study. The theory and [[literary criticism|criticism]] of literature are, of course, also closely tied to the [[history of literature]].

However, the modern sense of "literary theory" only dates to approximately the 1950s when the [[structuralist linguistics]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] began to strongly influence [[English language]] literary criticism. The [[New Critics]] and various European-influenced [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]]s (particularly the [[Russian Formalists]]) had described some of their more abstract efforts as "theoretical" as well. But it was not until the broad impact of structuralism began to be felt in the English-speaking academic world that "literary theory" was thought of as a unified domain.

In the academic world of the United Kingdom and the United States, literary theory was at its most popular from the late 1960s (when its influence was beginning to spread outward from elite universities like [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]], [[Yale University|Yale]], and [[Cornell University|Cornell]]) through the 1980s (by which time it was taught nearly everywhere in some form). During this span of time, literary theory was perceived as academically cutting-edge, and most university literature departments sought to teach and study theory and incorporate it into their curricula. Because of its meteoric rise in popularity and the difficult language of its key texts, theory was also often criticized as [[fad]]dish or trendy [[obscurantism]] (and many academic satire novels of the period, such as those by [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]], feature theory prominently). Some scholars, both theoretical and anti-theoretical, refer to the 1970s and 1980s debates on the academic merits of theory as "the theory wars".

By the early 1990s, the popularity of "theory" as a subject of interest by itself was declining slightly (along with job openings for pure "theorists") even as the texts of literary theory were incorporated into the study of almost all literature.  By 2010, the controversy over the use of theory in literary studies had quieted down, and discussions on the topic within literary and cultural studies tend now to be considerably milder and less lively. However, some scholars like [[Mark Bauerlein]] continue to argue that less capable theorists have abandoned proven methods of [[epistemology]], resulting in persistent lapses in learning, research, and evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Overview&lt;!--linked from 'New Historicism'--&gt;==
One of the fundamental questions of literary theory is "what is [[literature]]?" &amp;ndash; although many contemporary theorists and literary scholars believe either that  "literature" cannot be defined or that it can refer to any use of [[language]]. Specific theories are distinguished not only by their methods and conclusions, but even by how they create meaning in a "[[text (literary theory)|text]]". However, some theorists acknowledge that these texts do not have a singular, fixed meaning which is deemed "correct".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Patrick|date=2002-01-01|title="Reception Moments," Modern Literary Theory, and the Teaching of Literature|jstor=40012241|journal=Journal of Adolescent &amp; Adult Literacy|volume=45|issue=7|pages=568–577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since theorists of literature often draw on a very heterogeneous tradition of [[Continental philosophy]] and the [[philosophy of language]], any classification of their approaches is only an approximation. There are many types of literary theory, which take different approaches to texts. Even among those listed below, many scholars combine methods from more than one of these approaches (for instance, the [[deconstruction|deconstructive]] approach of [[Paul de Man]] drew on a long tradition of [[close reading]] pioneered by the [[New Critics]], and de Man was trained in the European [[hermeneutic]] tradition).{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Broad schools of theory that have historically been important include historical and [[biographical criticism]], [[New Criticism]], [[formalism (literature)|formalism]], [[Russian formalism]], and [[structuralism]], [[post-structuralism]], [[Marxism]], [[feminism]] and [[French feminism]], [[post-colonialism]], [[new historicism]], [[deconstruction]], [[reader-response criticism]], and [[Psychoanalytic literary criticism|psychoanalytic]] criticism.

== Differences among schools ==
{{Original research|section|date=May 2012}}
The different interpretive and epistemological perspectives of different schools of theory often arise from, and so give support to, different moral and political commitments. For instance, the work of the [[New Critics]] often contained an implicit moral dimension, and sometimes even a religious one: a New Critic might read a poem by [[T. S. Eliot]] or [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] for its degree of honesty in expressing the torment and contradiction of a serious search for belief in the modern world. Meanwhile, a [[Marxist]] critic might find such judgments merely ideological rather than critical; the Marxist would say that the New Critical reading did not keep enough critical distance from the poem's religious stance to be able to understand it. Or a [[post-structuralist]] critic might simply avoid the issue by understanding the religious meaning of a poem as an allegory of meaning, treating the poem's references to "God" by discussing their referential nature rather than what they refer to. A critic using [[Darwinian literary studies]] might use arguments from the [[evolutionary psychology of religion]].

Such a disagreement cannot be easily resolved, because it is inherent in the radically different terms and goals (that is, the theories) of the critics. Their theories of reading derive from vastly different intellectual traditions: the New Critic bases his work on an East-Coast American scholarly and religious tradition, while the Marxist derives his thought from a body of critical social and economic thought, the post-structuralist's work emerges from twentieth-century Continental philosophy of language, and the Darwinian from the [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary synthesis]]. To expect such different approaches to have much in common would be naïve; so calling them all "theories of literature" without acknowledging their heterogeneity is itself a reduction of their differences.

In the late 1950s, the Canadian literary critic [[Northrop Frye]] attempted to establish an approach for reconciling historical criticism and New Criticism while addressing concerns of early reader-response and numerous psychological and social approaches. His approach, laid out in his ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', was explicitly structuralist, relying on the assumption of an intertextual "order of words" and universality of certain structural types. His approach held sway in English literature programs for several decades but lost favor during the ascendance of post-structuralism.

For some theories of literature (especially certain kinds of formalism), the distinction between "literary" and other sorts of texts is of paramount importance. Other schools (particularly post-structuralism in its various forms: new historicism, deconstruction, some strains of Marxism and feminism) have sought to break down distinctions between the two and have applied the tools of textual interpretation to a wide range of "texts", including film, non-fiction, historical writing, and even cultural events.

[[Mikhail Bakhtin]] argued that the "utter inadequacy" of literary theory is evident when it is forced to deal with the [[novel]]; while other genres are fairly stabilized, the novel is still developing.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 1981, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

Another crucial distinction among the various theories of literary interpretation is intentionality, the amount of weight given to the author's own opinions about and intentions for a work. For most pre-20th century approaches, the author's intentions are a guiding factor and an important determiner of the "correct" interpretation of texts. The New Criticism was the first school to disavow the role of the author in interpreting texts, preferring to focus on "the text itself" in a [[close reading]]. In fact, as much contention as there is between formalism and later schools, they share the tenet that the author's interpretation of a work is no more inherently meaningful than any other.

==Schools==
Listed below are some of the most commonly identified schools of literary theory, along with their major authors.  In many cases, such as those of the historian and philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] and the anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], the authors were not primarily literary critics, but their work has been broadly influential in literary theory.

'''Cuauhtinchan Archeological Zone''' or '''Malinalco Archeological Zone''', located just west of the town center on a hill called '''Cerro de los Idolos''', which rises 215 meters above the town.&lt;ref name="A-G-59"&gt;{{harvnb|Aguilar-Moreno|2009|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SS_aCCujQ3gC&amp;pg=PA59 59]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On its sides are a number of pre-Hispanic structures built on terraces built into the hill.

The site contains six buildings.&lt;ref name="Aguilar-Moreno"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Aguilar-Moreno, Manuel|year=2009|chapter=Chapter 5: Malinalco: A Place between Heaven and Earth|editor=Christie, Jessica Joyce|title=Landscapes of Origin in the Americas: Creation Narratives Linking Ancient Places and Present Communities|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SS_aCCujQ3gC&amp;pg=PA57 57&amp;ndash;76]|isbn=978-0-8173-1673-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cuauhcalli or House of the Eagles, which dates from 1501,&lt;ref name="A-G-64"&gt;{{harvnb|Aguilar-Moreno|2009|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SS_aCCujQ3gC&amp;pg=PA64 64]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the main building, which is significant in that it is carved out of the hill itself.&lt;ref name="encanto"/&gt; The building is in the shape of a truncated pyramid,&lt;ref name="noguez"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Noguez |first=Xavier |year=2006 |title=El templo monolítico de Malinalco, Estado de México |trans-title=The monolithic temple of Malinalco, Mexico State |journal=Arqueología Mexicana |volume=78 |pages=68–73 |url=http://www.arqueomex.com/S2N3nMalinalco78.html |language=Spanish |accessdate=2009-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103100544/http://arqueomex.com/S2N3nMalinalco78.html |archivedate=2010-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; built this way due to the lack of space on the hill.&lt;ref name="cdtravel"/&gt; The monolithic Cuauhcalli has been compared to the [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] in [[India]], [[Petra]] on the shores of the [[Dead Sea]] and [[Abu Simbel]] in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="novo"/&gt; This was a sanctuary for the Eagle Warriors for rites such as initiation.&lt;ref name="encanto"/&gt; A thirteen-step staircase leading into this temple is flanked by side struts.&lt;ref name="novo"/&gt; and two feline sculptures that face the plaza in front.&lt;ref name="noguez"/&gt; The Cuauhcalli consists of two rooms, one rectangular and the other circular, with an opening in the wall between the two. After being carved out of the rock, the walls and ceiling were covered in stucco and painted with murals, most of which are almost completely gone.&lt;ref name="cdtravel"/&gt; In the upper part, the entrance is symbolized by the open jaws of a serpent, complete with fangs, eyes and a forked tongue, which was painted red.&lt;ref name="novo"/&gt; This upper portion is covered by a thatched roof of the grass the area is named for.&lt;ref name="noguez"/&gt;

== Architecture ==
Just inside of the entrance, on the east side, there is a sculpture of a serpent’s head on which rests the remains of a statue of an Eagle Warrior. To the west, there is another sculpture in the shape of a large pedestal, symbolizing a tlapanhuéhuetl (war drum). Above this is a sculpture of a [[cipactli]], which is a primeval being, occasionally called a “monster of the earth.” The cipactli is holding up a person, of which only the sandals remain.&lt;ref name="noguez"/&gt; It is thought the two statues functioned as standards. Further inside is a bench that surrounds a space similar to a [[hemicycle]].&lt;ref name="A-G-64" /&gt; The horseshoe bench has four sculptures, the most outstanding one being an eagle that faces the entrance. Two others are also of eagles while the fourth is a jaguar.&lt;ref name="noguez"/&gt; The jaguar statue has its skin spread out as if it were a mounted trophy.&lt;ref name="novo"/&gt; Behind the eagles there is a [[cuauhxicalli]] or sacred vessel in which to put the hearts of sacrifice victims, who then turn into messengers of the sun. The orientation of the building relates to the movement of the stars. Before it was covered with a thatched roof to preserve it, openings in the walls provoked light phenomena at certain times such as at the summer solstice.&lt;ref name="encanto"/&gt;

From here was found a large wooden [[huéhuetl]] or ceremonial war drum, which is now in the Museum of Anthropology and History in the [[Mexiquense Cultural Center]] in Toluca.&lt;ref name="cdtravel"/&gt; At the spring and fall equinoxes some 5,000 to 7,000 people visit the site.&lt;ref name="solis"&gt;{{Cite news |title= Ambulantaje, basura y daños en las zonas arqueológicas |first=Juan |last=Solis |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/cultura/w47951.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=2006-03-06 |accessdate=2009-10-29 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Wandering vendors, trash and damage at archeological zones }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conical thatched roof that covers the main building is a reproduction of the kind of roof it probably had in antiquity, but the shed-like porch is less faithful to the original.&lt;ref name="townsend"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Townsend |first1=Richard F. |editor1-first=Elizabeth H. |editor1-last=Boone |title= The Art and Iconography of Late Post-Classic Central Mexico |year=1982 |publisher= Dumbarton Oaks |location= Washington, DC |pages=119–120 |chapter= Malinalco and the Lords of Tenochtitlan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite acts of vandalism, the interior of this building is still in good condition.&lt;ref name="noguez"/&gt;

'''Celia Ann "Mattie" Blaylock''' (January 1850 – July 3, 1888) was a prostitute who became the romantic companion and common-law wife of [[Old West]] [[Law enforcement officer|lawman]] and [[gambler]] [[Wyatt Earp]] for about three years. &lt;!-- (''needs clarification, according to Wyatt Earp's bio they were together 3 years'') --&gt; Knowledge of her place in Wyatt's life was concealed by [[Josephine Earp]], his later common-law wife, who worked hard to protect her and Wyatt's reputation in their later years.

== Early life==
Mattie was born Celia Ann Blaylock in Monroe Township, Johnson County, Iowa, near [[Fairfax, Iowa]], to Henry Blaylock and Elizabeth "Betsy" Vance.&lt;ref name=meyers&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyers|first=E.C. (Ted)|title=Mattie: Wyatt Earp's Secret Second Wife|year=2010|publisher=Hancock House Publishers|url=http://www.hancockhouse.com/products/pdfs/Mattie_ch%201.pdf|location=Surrey, B.C.|isbn=978-0-88839-628-0|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827015213/http://www.hancockhouse.com/products/pdfs/Mattie_ch%201.pdf|archivedate=2011-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was their third child and second daughter. The family lived on a small farm that Henry had obtained in 1846. Henry and his wife were stern parents and adhered to the principle, "spare the rod and spoil the child," and "children should be seen and not heard."

Celia, or "Celie" as she was known as a child, attended Sunday school, learned Biblical parables, and was taught to live by the [[Ten Commandments]]. When her older sister Martha Jane was 17 &lt;!-- (''needs clarification, the numbers do not add up'') --&gt; she married Charles Probst on July 1, 1870.&lt;ref name=meyers/&gt; Celia had no desire to live on a farm the rest of her life.

== Run away ==

In mid-1868, Celia ran away with her younger sister Sarah to avoid farm life. Celia was a reasonably skilled seamstress and may have sought work in that field, but both girls found life on their own very difficult. There were few employment possibilities for young girls. They likely headed west to one of the growing towns along the Kansas-Iowa-Missouri border area.&lt;ref name=meyers/&gt; Sarah returned home less than a year later, chagrined and shamed by her experience. Her parents greeted her cheerlessly and took her back in disgrace.&lt;ref name=meyers/&gt;

At some point after leaving home, Celia chose the alias "Mattie", probably in an effort to conceal her identity and remain as anonymous as possible. However, court records indicate that she continued to call herself by her childhood nickname of "Celie", which was often phonetically spelled by court clerks as "Sally"; no court records have been found throughout her life using the name "Mattie". The first known record of Mattie's presence is a picture taken in [[Fort Scott, Kansas|Fort Scott]] in 1871. It's not known where she and Sarah spent the intervening time. Court records show that she adopted [[prostitute|prostitution]] as her profession beginning in 1872&lt;ref name=meyers/&gt; in Fort Scott, then later in [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]].

== Meets Wyatt Earp ==

Mattie Blaylock may have met Wyatt between 1871 and 1873. She continued to work as a prostitute during their early years together. In the 1880 [[United States Census]] Blaylock is listed as Wyatt's wife though there is no record of a legal marriage.&lt;ref name=eppinga&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Eppinga | first1 = Jane | last2 =  | first2 =  | title = Around Tombstone: Ghost Towns and Gunfights | year = 2009 | publisher = Arcadia Pub. | location = Charleston, SC | isbn = 978-0-7385-7127-0 | pages = 128 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RUA2TSS3d8UC&amp;pg=PA47 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160420202619/https://books.google.com/books?id=RUA2TSS3d8UC&amp;pg=PA47 | archivedate = 2016-04-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|47}}&lt;ref name=eppinga/&gt;{{rp|65}}

Blaylock was said to have suffered from headaches, and while in [[Tombstone, Arizona]], she became addicted to [[laudanum]], a common opiate and pain killer.&lt;ref name=eppinga/&gt;{{rp|65}} It is not known exactly when Earp and Blaylock ended their relationship. Tombstone diarist [[George W. Parsons]] never mentioned seeing Earp and his next common-law wife, [[Josephine Earp|Josephine "Sadie" Marcus]], together and neither did John Clum in his memoirs.&lt;ref name=barra&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1998/8/1998_8_76.shtml |title=Who Was Wyatt Earp? |first=Alan |last=Barra |publisher=American Heritage Magazine |date=December 1998 |volume=49 |issue=8 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507101535/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1998/8/1998_8_76.shtml |archivedate=2006-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|235}} Frank Waters wrote in ''The Earp Brothers of Tombstone'' of public fights between Sadie Marcus and Blaylock and how the affair was a public scandal. However, Waters' book has been criticized as biased for its negative portrayal of Wyatt Earp and for including details not mentioned in the original manuscript by Allie Earp (the common-law wife of Wyatt Earp's brother [[Virgil Earp|Virgil]]).&lt;ref name=roberts&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberts|first=Gary|title=Allie's Story: Mrs. Virgil Earp and The "Tombstone Travesty"|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~knuthco1/Travesty/AlliesStory1source.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307033040/http://home.earthlink.net/~knuthco1/Travesty/AlliesStory1source.htm|archivedate=2016-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] and the March 18, 1882, [[assassination]] of [[Morgan Earp]], Wyatt Earp, his youngest brother [[Warren Earp|Warren]], and a posse of other deputies began a [[Earp vendetta ride|vendetta]]. They hunted down some of the [[outlaw]] [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]] they believed responsible for maiming [[Virgil Earp]] and killing [[Morgan Earp|Morgan]]. In early April, Wyatt left Arizona for New Mexico and then Colorado.

Blaylock left Tombstone with other Earp family members for [[Colton, California]]. She apparently expected to receive a [[telegram]] from Earp telling her where to meet him, but it never arrived. Instead, Earp went to San Francisco in late 1882 and began a relationship with [[Josephine Earp|Josephine "Sadie" Marcus]], who had been the common-law wife of [[Johnny Behan]] in Tombstone. Blaylock left Colton for [[Pinal City, Arizona|Pinal City]], [[Arizona Territory]], a town that Blaylock and Earp had stopped in for two months in 1879 on their way to Tombstone. When the couple had been there three years earlier, it was a booming silver town. Upon Mattie's return, however, the silver boom had died down and the bulk of the town's population had moved on. Blaylock had planned a return to prostitution in Pinal City, but with most of the prospective clientele gone with the silver, making a living there proved difficult.

== Death ==
[[File:Mattie Earp Death.jpg|thumb|Death Record]]
On July 3, 1888, Blaylock took a lethal dose of [[laudanum]] and alcohol. Her death was ruled as "[[suicide]] by [[opium]] poisoning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genealogy.az.gov/azdeath/001/10010439.pdf |title=Standard Certificate |publisher=State of Arizona Department of Commerce |accessdate=May 12, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yfSuk8Wr?url=http://genealogy.az.gov/azdeath/001/10010439.pdf |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A long time abuser of laudanum and alcohol, it is possible she overdosed by accident and died of respiratory depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thci.org/Opioid/nov08docs/swift.pdf |title=Pharmacology and Pharmacokinetics of Alcohol and Opioids |publisher=Robert M.

She is buried in the cemetery at [[Pinal City, Arizona|Pinal City]], now a [[ghost town]], and located just west of the former cement and mining town of [[Superior, Arizona]].

[[File:Day 12 Occupy Wall Street September 28 2011 Shankbone 31.JPG|thumb|During the initial weeks of [[Occupy Wall Street]], protesters such as this man considered the lack of news coverage to be a media blackout.]]

'''Media blackout''' refers to the [[censorship]] of [[news]] related to a certain topic, particularly in [[mass media]], for any reason. A media blackout may be voluntary, or may in some countries be enforced by the [[government]] or [[State (polity)|state]]. The latter case is controversial in [[peacetime]], as some regard it as a [[human rights violation]] and repression of [[freedom of speech|free speech]]. '''Press blackout''' is a similar phrase, but refers specifically to printed media.

Media blackouts are used, in particular, in times of declared [[war]], to keep useful intelligence from the enemy. In some cases formal censorship is used, in others the news media are usually keen to support their country voluntarily as in the UK [[DA-Notice|D- (later DA-)Notice]] system in the Second World War.

== Examples ==

===Historical===
Some examples of media blackout would include the media bans of southern [[Japan]] during the droppings of the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic]] bombs on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]],&lt;ref&gt;Matsubara, Hiroshi (2001-05-08) [http://www.nci.org/0new/hibakusha-jt5701.htm Prejudice haunts atomic bomb survivors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810060050/http://www.nci.org/0new/hibakusha-jt5701.htm |date=10 August 2007 }}, Nci.org. Retrieved on 2 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and the lack of independent media correspondence from [[Iraq]] during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC News (2009-04-06) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7986203.stm US war dead media blackout lifted] Retrieved on 21 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, the US [[Office of Censorship]] sent messages to newspapers and radio stations, which were acted on by recipients, asking them not to report any sightings or explosions of [[Fu-Go balloon bomb|fire balloons]], so the Japanese would have no information on the balloons' effectiveness when planning future actions. As a result, the Japanese learned the fate of only one of their bombs, which landed in [[Wyoming]], but failed to explode. The Japanese stopped all launches after less than six months. The press blackout in the U.S. was lifted after the first deaths from fire balloons, to ensure that the public was warned, though public knowledge of the threat could have possibly prevented the deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first= Jeffery Alan|title=War &amp; Press Freedom: The Problem of Prerogative Power - |publisher= Language Arts &amp; Disciplines|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; News of the loss of over 4,000 lives when UK ship [[RMS Lancastria|RMS ''Lancastria'']] was sunk during the war was voluntarily suppressed to prevent it affecting civilian [[morale]], but was published after it became known overseas.

===Contemporary===
Some media critics have questioned whether the 2000 [[Wichita Massacre]] received little to no coverage in the mainstream media due to [[political correctness]] regarding the race of the perpetrators and the victims. Such critics also cite the 2007 [[Murders of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;

In 2006, a media blackout was imposed during Israel's illegal invasion of Lebanon. Of all the media outlets, Al-Jazeera was one of the very few that continued to offer coverage. This act promoted the newschannel to international recognition.

A media blackout was used during the [[2005 New York City transit strike]] to allow for more effective contract negotiation between the two sides of the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;NYSun.com (2005-12-27)[http://www.nysun.com/editorials/media-blackout/24991/ 'Media Blackout'] Retrieved on 21 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Most typically, the more freedom of the press that any particular country has, and the more sensational the story, the more likely it is that at least one news organization will ignore the "blackout" and run the story.

The 2008 abduction of Canadian journalist [[Mellissa Fung]] was given a media blackout to assure her safe return. All media sources obliged making the Canadian public unaware of the fate of Fung.

In 2008, the fact that [[Prince Harry]], then third in line to the British throne, was serving on active duty in Afghanistan was subject to a blackout in the British media for his own safety. He was brought home early after the blackout was broken by foreign media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gammell|first=Caroline|title=How the Prince Harry blackout was broken|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1580111/How-the-Prince-Harry-blackout-was-broken.html|accessdate=9 September 2011|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 June 2009, when news came that ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter [[David Rohde]] had escaped from his Taliban captors, few knew he had even been kidnapped, because for the seven months he and two Afghan colleagues were in the Taliban's hands, The Times kept that information under wraps.  Out of concern for the reporter's safety, ''The Times'' asked other major news organizations to do the same; [[NPR]] was among dozens of news outlets that did not report on the kidnapping at the urging of Rohde's colleagues. [[Kelly McBride]], who teaches [[ethics]] to journalists at the [[Poynter Institute]], says she was "really astounded" by the media blackout.  "I find it a little disturbing, because it makes me wonder what else 40 international news organizations have agreed not to tell the public," she tells NPR's [[Melissa Block]].  McBride says the blackout could hurt the credibility of news organizations.  "I don't think we do ourselves any favors long term for our credibility when we have a total news blackout on something that's clearly of interest to the public," she says.&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Block (2009-06-23) [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105775059 Reporter's Escape From Taliban Spurs Ethics Debate], NPR.org.

On 18 January 2012, Wikipedia participated in a voluntary media blackout to protest [[SOPA]].

Some blackouts, or media dereliction, may arise due to social factors rather than mandates, such as the [[Kermit Gosnell]] abortion trial having been avoided by all media. Congresswoman [[Marsha Blackburn]] and 71 other Members of Congress condemned the blackout. It was also termed a blackout by Troy Newman, president of the Kansas-based pro-life Operation Rescue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/04/kermit_gosnell_abortion_trial_conservatives_took_to_twitter_to_shame_mainstream.html|title=A Jury of Your Peers|first=David|last=Weigel|date=15 April 2013|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Writing for The Washington Post, Melinda Henneberger responded that "we didn’t write more because the only abortion story most outlets ever cover in the news pages is every single threat or perceived threat to abortion rights. In fact, that is so fixed a view of what constitutes coverage of that issue that it’s genuinely hard, I think, for many journalists to see a story outside that paradigm as news. That’s not so much a conscious decision as a reflex, but the effect is one-sided coverage". Explaining why some of her colleagues did not report on the story, Henneberger wrote, "One colleague viewed Gosnell’s alleged atrocities as a local crime story, though I can’t think of another mass murder, with hundreds of victims, that we ever saw that way. Another said it was just too lurid, though that didn’t keep us from covering Jeffrey Dahmer, or that aspiring cannibal at the NYPD."[140] Writing for Bloomberg View, Jeffrey Goldberg said that this story "upsets a particular narrative about the reality of certain types of abortion, and that reality isn’t something some pro-choice absolutists want to discuss"."

In late 2015 to mid 2016, the supporters and campaign of [[Democratic Party (United States)]] candidate [[Bernie Sanders]] accused Sanders was being subject to a mass media blackout, citing that Sanders had received only 20 seconds of media coverage by [[ABC Television Network]]'s ''[[ABC World News Tonight|World News Tonight]]'' in contrast to 81 minutes of [[Donald Trump]] media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/dem-primaries/263037-sanders-campaign-slams-blackout-by-corporate-media|title=Sanders campaign slams ‘blackout’ by corporate media|first=Elliot|last=Smilowitz|date=12 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 many speculate that the UK government blacked-out the media relating to the [[Nuit debout]] due to the upcoming UK Referendum vote on the EU Membership.

On 24 January 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump instituted a media blackout at the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] and barred staff from awarding any new contracts or grants, the same day he signed an order to move controversial [[Keystone XL]] and Dakota Access oil pipelines forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/4645559/donald-trump-epa-social-media-blackout/|title=White House Freezes Twitter Accounts at Environmental Protection Agency|date=24 January 2017|publisher=TIME}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In association football===
{{anchor|In football}}
In [[football (soccer)|association football]], a press or media blackout is also referred to as a ''silenzio stampa'' (literally ''press silence'') from the corresponding [[Italian language|Italian]] phrase. It specifically refers to when a football club or national team and the players refuse to give interviews or in any other way cooperate with the press, often during important tournaments, or when the club feels that the media does not depict the club and their activities in an objective way. The phrase ''silenzio stampa'' was born during the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]], when the [[Italy national football team|Italian team]] created a news blackout due to rumors and untrue{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} stories circulating in the press.&lt;ref name="lawrence"&gt;{{cite news |first=Amy |last=Lawrence |title=Italians kick up a stink |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/sport/story/0,,1784745,00.html |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2006-05-28 |accessdate=2007-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Williams |title=The silent right of militant millionaires |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,1301339,00.html |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2004-09-10 |accessdate=2007-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orangism''' was a political current in what is now [[Belgium]] that supported its inclusion in the short-lived [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] (1815&amp;ndash;1830). After the secession of Belgium in 1830, Orangist sentiment in [[Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]] for a time sought a restoration of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. It was a movement directed by [[William I of the Netherlands]] as part of his "Volhardingspolitiek" and containing most of the Belgian elites (nobility, industrials). Some of the most prominent Flemish Orangists were [[Jan Frans Willems]] and [[Hippolyte Metdepenningen]]. Although refusing to participate in parliamentary elections as they deemed Belgian national institutions as illegitimate, the Orangists did take part in local elections (province and municipal) from which they activated against the new Belgian state through political actions and an activist press. At least three Orangist coups were foiled during the 1830s. Although losing Dutch financial and political support after the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]] (1839) and William I's abdication (1840), the weakening Belgian Orangism survived well into the 1850s, strongly opposing the [[Belgian Revolution]] and rallying against independence.&lt;ref&gt;Els Witte, "Het verloren Koninkrijk", De Bezige Bij, Antwrpen, 2014, 688 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was one inspiration for the later [[Greater Netherlands]] movement, although that movement was not all monarchist.

The '''organon model''', formulated by [[Karl Bühler]], defined the functions of communication according to which linguistic communication can be described. Bühler's work influenced [[Roman Jakobson]] for his [[Jakobson's functions of language|communication model]].

Bühler identified the following three communicative functions:
* the ''expressive function'' (''Ausdrucksfunktion'')
* the ''representation function'' (''Darstellungsfunktion'')
* the ''conative function'' (''Appellfunktion'', i.e. appealing function).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5172">{{wiktionary|polyptoton}}
'''Polyptoton''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɒ|l|ᵻ|p|ˈ|t|oʊ|t|ɒ|n}} is the [[rhetorical device|stylistic scheme]] in which words derived from the same root are repeated (such as "strong" and "strength"). A related stylistic device is [[antanaclasis]], in which the same word is repeated, but each time with a different sense. Another related term is [[figura etymologica]].

In inflected languages polyptoton is the same word being repeated but appearing each time in a different case. (for example, &lt;span style= "font-family: serif"&gt;"Iuppiter", "Iovis", "Iovi", "Iovem", "Iove"&lt;/span&gt; [in Latin being the nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative forms of &lt;span style= "font-family: serif"&gt;"[[Jupiter (mythology)|Iuppiter]]"&lt;/span&gt; (the god Jupiter), respectively]).

The form is relatively common in Latin Christian poetry and prose in a construction called the superlative genitive, in phrases such as [[sanctum sanctorum]] ("holy of holies"), and found its way into languages such as [[Old English]], which naturally preferred the prevalent [[alliteration]] that is part and parcel of polyptoton—in fact, polyptoton is "much more prevalent in Old English verse than in Latin verse." The specific superlative genitive in Old English, however, occurs only in Latinate Christian poems, not in secular poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fleming| first=Damian |editor1=Michael Fox |editor2=Manish Sharma |title=Old English Literature and the Old Testament |year=2012 |publisher=U of Toronto P |location=Toronto |isbn=9780802098542 |pages=229–52 |url= http://www.books.google.com/books?id=OPBv9DIVf0oC| chapter=''Rex regum et cyninga cyning'': 'Speaking Hebrew' in Cynewulf's ''Elene''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used in [[public speaking]], and several examples can be found in [[Churchill]]'s speeches. 

[[G. K. Chesterton]] frequently employed this device to create [[paradox]]: 
{{quote |text=It is the same with all the powerful of to-day; it is the same, for instance, with the high-placed and high-paid official. Not only is the '''judge''' not '''judicial''', but the '''arbiter''' is not even '''arbitrary'''.|author=G.K. Chesterton, ''The Man on Top'' (1912)&lt;ref name="Farnsworth72"&gt;{{harvsp|Farnsworth|2011|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In combination with verbal [[active voice|active]] and [[passive voice]]s, it points out the idea of a latent [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]]:{{quote |text='''Judge''' not, that ye '''be''' not '''judged'''|author=Matthew 7:1&lt;ref name="Farnsworth63"&gt;{{harvsp|Farnsworth|2011|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An alternative way to use the device is to develop polyptoton over the course of an entire novel, which is done in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Shelley combines polyptoton with periphrastic naming, which is the technique of referring to someone using several indirect names. The creature in Frankenstein is referred to by many terms, such as "fiend", "devil", "being", and "ogre". However, the first term that Shelley uses in reference to the creature is "wretch". Throughout the novel, various forms of this are used, such as "wretchedly" and "wretchedness", which may be seen as polyptoton.  According to Duyfhuizen, the gradual development of polyptoton in ''Frankenstein'' is significant because it symbolizes the intricacies of one's own identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duyfhuizen | first1 = Bernard | year = 1995 | title = Periphrastic Naming In Mary Shelley's Frankenstein | url = | journal = Studies In The Novel | volume = 27 | issue = 4| page = 477 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Postvaccinal encephalitis''' ('''PVE''') is postvaccinal [[Complication (medicine)|complication]] which was associated with [[vaccination]] with [[vaccinia virus]] during worldwide [[smallpox eradication]] campaign.&lt;ref name="Ricardo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jorge|first1=Ricardo|date=January 1932|title=Post-vaccinal encephalitis : Its association with vaccination and with post-infectious and acute disseminated encephalitis|url=|journal=The Lancet|volume=219|issue=5656|pages=215–220|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)82942-6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With mortality ranging between 25 – 30% and lifelong consequences between 16 – 30% it was one of the most severe adverse events associated with this vaccination. The mechanism of its underlying condition is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Post-Vaccination Encephalitis|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=1 September 1931|volume=5|issue=3|pages=333|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-5-3-333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symptoms ==
PVE symptoms start to appear between 8th and 14th day after vaccination. Amongst the first are fever, headache, confusion and nausea. With passing time [[lethargy]], [[Epileptic seizure|seizures,]] short and long term memory dysfunctions, localized paralysis, [[hemiplegia]], [[polyneuritis]] and [[Convulsion|convulsions]]. In extreme cases PVE can lead to [[coma]] and death.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roos|first1=K L|last2=Eckerman|first2=N L|date=2002|title=The smallpox vaccine and postvaccinal encephalitis.|journal=Semin Neurol.|volume=22|issue=1|pages=95–98|doi=10.1055/s-2002-33052}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ricardo" /&gt;

== Treatment ==
Vaccinia immunoglobulin was given to patients with PVE. But some significant effects of this treatment were observed only if given before PVE developed. That is why only supportive treatment was given to patients with PVE to attenuate symptoms. [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5204a1.htm Source]

== Histology ==
Inflammatory extra-adventitial lesions are found not only in brain but in spinal cord as well. Lesions might be uniform in acute phase or disseminated in subacute phase. Unlike in cases of [[encephalitis lethargica]] the main damage is found in white brain matter. Meninges are infiltrated with [[T cell|T cells]], plasmatic cells and [[Phagocyte|phagocytic cells]]. Polymorfonuclear cells were found only in severe lesions. Apart from cellular infiltrate in [[Perivascular space|perivascular]] space there is a tissue rarefication in spaces close to damaged blood vessels. Accumulated small nuclei are found in places of such rarefication. Strong [[demyelination]] with rapid clearance of degraded [[myelin]] is also observed in cases of PVE. Tissue damage leads to [[necrosis]] in the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perdrau|first1=J R|date=1928|title=The histology of post‐vaccinal encephalitis|journal=The Journal of Pathology|volume=31|pages=17–39|doi=10.1002/path.1700310104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidence ==
Vaccination with vaccinia virus was accompanied with a spectrum of adverse events. Some of them lethal. Generally accepted number of deaths after vaccination with live vaccine is one per one million vaccinations. But during the eradication campaign more than one vaccination strain was used and these strains differed significantly in causing adverse events.

The incidence of PVE was between 44.9 cases per one million vaccinations with Bern strain used in western Europe to 2.9 cases per one million vaccinations with NYCBH strain used in the US. Number of deaths directly connected to PVE also differed from strain to strain. With 11 deaths per one million vaccinations with the Bern strain to 1.2 deaths per one million vaccinations with the NYCBH strain. PVE incidence also depended on the age of the vaccinated person. That is why in the US children up to one year of age and in Europe children up to three years of age were excluded from vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kretzschmar|first1=Mirjam|last2=Wallinga|first2=Jacco|last3=Teunis|first3=Peter|last4=Xing|first4=Shuqin|last5=Mikolajczyk|first5=Rafael|date=2006|title=Frequency of Adverse Events after Vaccination with Different Vaccinia Strains|journal=PLoS Med|volume=3|issue=8|pages=1341–1351|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Complications with the central neural system after smallpox vaccination were observed for the first time right after the vaccination begun. The first diagnosed case of PVE was in 1905.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In times of the smallpox eradication campaign, when PVE was a serious problem, there were no tools for identification of immune mechanism behind PVE available. Considering the fact that modern smallpox vaccines are much safer and only chosen personnel are vaccinated, PVE is no longer in the centre of attention. Nevertheless, for its similarity with [[acute disseminated encephalomyelitis]] (ADEM), which is also postvaccinal adverse reaction (observed for example after anti [[hepatitis A]] or B virus vaccination), PVE is considered to be of autoimmune nature. There is no final proof of PVE being caused directly by vaccine virus replication in neural tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogalewski|first1=Andreas|last2=Kraus|first2=Jörg|last3=Hasselblatt|first3=Martin|last4=Kraemer|first4=Christoffer|last5=Schäbitz|first5=Wolf-Rüdiger|date=2007|title=Improvement of advanced postvaccinal demyelinating encephalitis due to plasmapheresis|journal=Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment|volume=3|issue=6|pages=987–991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25230">In [[logic]], '''quantification''' specifies the quantity of specimens in the [[domain of discourse]] that satisfy an [[open formula]]. The two most common quantifiers mean "[[Universal quantification|for all]]" and "[[Existential quantification|there exists]]". For example, in arithmetic, quantifiers allow one to say that the natural numbers go on forever, by writing that ''for all'' n (where n is a natural number), there is another number (say, the successor of n) which is one bigger than n.&lt;!--this is to answer {{Technical|date=March 2016}} by making at least the first paragraph somewhat approachable. Of course the rest must be technical.--&gt;

A language element which generates a quantification (such as "every") is called a '''quantifier'''. 
The resulting expression is a quantified expression, it is said to be '''quantified''' over the predicate (such as "the natural number ''x'' has a successor")&lt;!---inconsistent with "satisfy an open formula" above:---or function expression---&gt;  whose [[Free variables and bound variables|free variable]] is bound by the quantifier. 
In formal languages, quantification is a formula constructor that produces new formulas from old ones.  
The [[semantics]] of the language specifies how the constructor is interpreted&lt;!---what is that suppoesd to mean?:---as an extent of validity---&gt;.
Two fundamental kinds of quantification in [[predicate (logic)|predicate logic]] are [[universal quantification]] and [[existential quantification]]. 
The traditional symbol for the universal quantifier "all" is "∀", a [[turned A|rotated letter "A"]], and for the existential quantifier "exists" is  "∃", a [[turned E|rotated letter "E"]]. These quantifiers have been generalized beginning with the work of [[Andrzej Mostowski|Mostowski]] and [[Per Lindström|Lindström]].

Quantification is used as well in [[natural language]]s; examples of quantifiers in English are ''for all'', ''for some'', ''many'', ''few'', ''a lot'', and ''no;'' see [[Quantifier (linguistics)]] for details.

==Mathematics==
Consider the following statement:
: 1 · 2 = 1 + 1, and 2 · 2 = 2 + 2, and 3 · 2 = 3 + 3, ..., and 100 · 2 = 100 + 100, and ..., etc.
This has the appearance of an ''infinite [[logical conjunction|conjunction]]'' of propositions.  From the point of view of [[formal language]]s this is immediately a problem, since [[syntax]] rules are expected to generate [[finite set|finite]] objects. The example above is fortunate in that there is a [[Algorithm|procedure]] to generate all the conjuncts.  However, if an assertion were to be made about every [[irrational number]], there would be no way to enumerate all the conjuncts, since irrationals cannot be enumerated. A succinct formulation which avoids these problems uses ''universal quantification'':
: For each [[natural number]] ''n'', ''n'' · 2 = ''n'' + ''n''.
A similar analysis applies to the [[disjunction (logic)|disjunction]],
: 1 is equal to 5 + 5, or 2 is equal to 5 + 5, or 3 is equal to 5 + 5, ... , or 100 is equal to 5 + 5, or ..., etc.
which can be rephrased using ''existential quantification'':
: For some [[natural number]] ''n'', ''n'' is equal to 5+5.

==Algebraic approaches to quantification==
It is possible to devise [[abstract algebra]]s whose [[model theory|models]] include [[formal language]]s with quantification, but progress has been slow{{clarify|date=October 2016}} and interest in such algebra has been limited. Three approaches have been devised to date:
* [[Relation algebra]], invented by [[Augustus De Morgan]], and developed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Ernst Schröder]], [[Alfred Tarski]], and Tarski's students. Relation algebra cannot represent any formula with quantifiers nested more than three deep. Surprisingly, the models of relation algebra include the [[axiomatic set theory]] [[ZFC]] and [[Peano arithmetic]];
* [[Cylindric algebra]], devised by [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Leon Henkin]], and others;
* The [[polyadic algebra]] of [[Paul Halmos]].

==Notation==
The two most common quantifiers are the universal quantifier and the existential quantifier. The traditional symbol for the universal quantifier is "[[∀]]", a rotated letter "[[A]]", which stands for  "for all" or "all".  The corresponding symbol for the existential quantifier is "[[∃]]", a rotated letter "[[E]]", which stands for "there exists" or "exists".

An example of translating a quantified English statement would be as follows. Given the statement, "Each of Peter's friends either likes to dance or likes to go to the beach," we can identify key aspects and rewrite using symbols including quantifiers. So, let ''X'' be the set of all Peter's friends, ''P''(''x'') the [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] "''x'' likes to dance", and ''Q''(''x'') the predicate "''x'' likes to go to the beach". Then the above sentence can be written in formal notation as &lt;math&gt; \forall{x}{\in}X, P(x) \lor Q(x) &lt;/math&gt;, which is read, "for every ''x'' that is a member of ''X'', ''P'' applies to ''x'' or ''Q'' applies to ''x''."

Some other quantified expressions are constructed as follows, 
: &lt;math&gt; \exists{x}\, P  \qquad \forall{x}\, P &lt;/math&gt;
for a formula ''P''. These two expressions (using the definitions above) are read as "there exists a friend of Peter who likes to dance" and "all friends of Peter like to dance" respectively.
Variant notations include, for set ''X'' and set members ''x'':
: &lt;math&gt; (\exists{x}) P \qquad (\exists x \ . \ P) \qquad \exists x \ \cdot \ P \qquad (\exists x : P) \qquad \exists{x}(P) \qquad \exists_{x}\, P \qquad \exists{x}{,}\, P \qquad \exists{x}{\in}X \, P \qquad \exists\, x{:}X \, P&lt;/math&gt;
All of these variations also apply to universal quantification.
Other variations for the universal quantifier are
: &lt;math&gt;(x) \, P \qquad \bigwedge_{x} P&lt;/math&gt;

Some versions of the notation explicitly mention the range of quantification.  The range of quantification must always be specified; for a given mathematical theory, this can be done in several ways:
* Assume a fixed domain of discourse for every quantification, as is done in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]],
* Fix several domains of discourse in advance and require that each variable have a declared domain, which is the ''type'' of that variable. This is analogous to the situation in [[Type system|statically typed]] [[computer programming]] languages, where variables have declared types.
* Mention explicitly the range of quantification, perhaps using a symbol for the set of all objects in that domain or the [[type (type theory)|type]] of the objects in that domain.

One can use any variable as a quantified variable in place of any other, under certain restrictions in which ''variable capture'' does not occur.  Even if the notation uses typed variables, variables of that type may be used.

Informally or in natural language, the "∀''x''" or "∃''x''" might appear after or in the middle of ''P''(''x''). Formally, however, the phrase that introduces the dummy variable is placed in front.

Mathematical formulas mix symbolic expressions for quantifiers, with natural language quantifiers such as
: For every natural number ''x'', ....
: There exists an ''x'' such that ....
: For at least one ''x''.
Keywords for [[uniqueness quantification]] include:
: For exactly one natural number ''x'', ....
: There is one and only one ''x'' such that ....
Further, ''x'' may be replaced by a [[pronoun]]. For example, 
:For every natural number, its product with 2 equals to its sum with itself
:Some natural number is prime.

==Nesting==
The order of quantifiers is critical to meaning, as is illustrated by the following two propositions:
:For every natural number ''n'', there exists a natural number ''s'' such that ''s'' = ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
This is clearly true; it just asserts that every natural number has a square. The meaning of the assertion in which the quantifiers are turned around is different:
:There exists a natural number ''s'' such that for every natural number ''n'', ''s'' = ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
This is clearly false; it asserts that there is a single natural number ''s'' that is at the same time the square of ''every'' natural number. This is because the syntax directs that any&lt;!---"newly" misleadingly indicates they the variable is introduced as the last one:---newly introduced---&gt; variable cannot be a function of subsequently introduced variables.

A less trivial example from [[mathematical analysis]] are the concepts of [[uniform continuity|uniform]] and [[continuous function|pointwise]] continuity, whose definitions differ only by an exchange in the positions of two quantifiers.
A function ''f'' from [[real numbers|'''R''']] to '''R''' is called
* pointwise continuous if ∀ε&gt;0 ∀''x''∈'''R''' ∃δ&gt;0 ∀''h''∈'''R''' (|''h''| &lt; δ → |''f''(''x'') – f(''x'' + ''h'')| &lt; ε)
* uniformly continuous if ∀ε&gt;0 ∃δ&gt;0 ∀''x''∈'''R''' ∀''h''∈'''R''' (|''h''| &lt; δ → |''f''(''x'') – f(''x'' + ''h'')| &lt; ε)
In the former case, the particular value chosen for ''δ'' can be a function of both ''ε'' and ''x'', the variables that precede it.
In the latter case, ''δ'' can be a function only of ''ε'', i.e. it has to be chosen independent of ''x''.
For example, ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; satisfies pointwise, but not uniform continuity.
In contrast, interchanging the two initial universal quantifiers in the definition of pointwise continuity does not change the meaning.

The maximum depth of nesting of quantifiers inside a formula is called its '''[[quantifier rank]]'''.

==Equivalent expressions==
If ''D'' is a domain of ''x'' and ''P''(''x'') is a predicate dependent on ''x'', then the universal proposition can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\!\in\!D\; P(x)&lt;/math&gt;

This notation is known as restricted or relativized or [[Bounded quantifier|bounded quantification]].  Equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\;(x\!\in\!D \to P(x))&lt;/math&gt;

The existential proposition can be expressed with bounded quantification as

:&lt;math&gt;\exists x\!\in\!D\; P(x)&lt;/math&gt;

or equivalently

:&lt;math&gt;\exists x\;(x\!\in\!\!D \land P(x))&lt;/math&gt;

Together with negation, only one of either the universal or existential quantifier is needed to perform both tasks:

:&lt;math&gt;\neg (\forall x\!\in\!D\; P(x)) \equiv \exists x\!\in\!D\; \neg P(x), &lt;/math&gt;

which shows that to disprove a "for all ''x''" proposition, one needs no more than to find an ''x'' for which the predicate is false. Similarly,

:&lt;math&gt;\neg (\exists x\!\in\!D\; P(x)) \equiv \forall x\!\in\!D\; \neg P(x), &lt;/math&gt;

to disprove a "there exists an ''x''" proposition, one needs to show that the predicate is false for all ''x''.

==Range of quantification==
Every quantification involves one specific variable and a ''domain of discourse'' or ''range of quantification'' of that variable.  The range of quantification specifies the set of values that the variable takes.  In the examples above, the range of quantification is the set of natural numbers.  Specification of the range of quantification allows us to express the difference between, asserting that a predicate holds for some natural number or for some [[real number]]. Expository conventions often reserve some variable names such as "''n''" for natural numbers and "''x''" for real numbers, although relying exclusively on naming conventions cannot work in general since ranges of variables can change in the course of a mathematical argument.

A more natural way to restrict the domain of discourse uses ''guarded quantification''.  For example, the guarded quantification 
:For some natural number ''n'', ''n'' is even and ''n'' is prime
means
:For some [[even number]] ''n'', ''n'' is prime.

In some mathematical theories a single domain of
discourse fixed in advance is assumed.  For example, in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], variables range over all sets.  In this case, guarded quantifiers can be used to mimic a smaller range of quantification.  Thus in the example
above to express
:For every natural number ''n'', ''n''·2 = ''n'' + ''n''
in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, it can be said
:For every ''n'', if ''n'' belongs to '''N''', then ''n''·2 = ''n'' + ''n'',
where '''N''' is the set of all natural numbers.

==Formal semantics==
Mathematical Semantics is the application of [[mathematics]] to study the meaning of expressions in a formal language. It has three elements: A mathematical specification of a class of objects via [[syntax]], a mathematical specification of various semantic domains and the relation between the two, which is usually expressed as a function from syntactic objects to semantic ones.  This article only addresses the issue of how quantifier elements are interpreted.

Given a [[model theory|model theoretical]] logical framework, the syntax of a formula can be given by a syntax tree. Quantifiers have scope and a variable ''x'' is [[free variable|free]] if it is not within the scope of a quantification for that variable. Thus in
:&lt;math&gt; \forall x (\exists y  B(x,y)) \vee C(y,x) &lt;/math&gt;
the occurrence of both ''x'' and ''y'' in ''C''(''y'',''x'') is free.

[[File:IMG Tree.gif|thumb|230px|right|Syntactic tree illustrating scope and variable capture]]
An interpretation for [[first-order predicate calculus]] assumes as given
a domain of individuals ''X''.  A formula ''A'' whose free variables
are ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is interpreted as a
[[Boolean function|boolean]]-valued function ''F''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,
''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) of ''n'' arguments, where each argument ranges
over the domain ''X''.  Boolean-valued means that the function assumes one of the values '''T''' (interpreted as truth) or '''F''' (interpreted as falsehood). The interpretation of the formula
:&lt;math&gt; \forall x_n A(x_1, \ldots , x_n) &lt;/math&gt;
is the function ''G'' of ''n''-1 arguments such that ''G''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;) = '''T''' if and only if ''F''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w'') = '''T''' for every ''w'' in ''X''. If  ''F''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w'') = '''F''' for at least one value of ''w'', then ''G''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;) = '''F'''.  Similarly the interpretation of the formula
:&lt;math&gt; \exists x_n A(x_1, \ldots , x_n) &lt;/math&gt;
is the function ''H'' of ''n''-1 arguments such that ''H''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;) = '''T''' if and only if ''F''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''w'') = '''T''' for at least one ''w'' and  ''H''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;) = '''F''' otherwise.

The semantics for [[uniqueness quantification]] requires  first-order predicate calculus with equality. This means there is given a distinguished two-placed predicate "="; the semantics is also modified accordingly so that "=" is always interpreted as the two-place equality relation on ''X''. The interpretation of  
:&lt;math&gt; \exists !   x_n A(x_1, \ldots , x_n) &lt;/math&gt;
then is the function of ''n''-1 arguments, which is the logical ''and'' of the interpretations of 
:&lt;math&gt; \exists  x_n A(x_1, \ldots , x_n) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \forall y,z \left\{  A(x_1, \ldots ,x_{n-1}, y) \wedge  A(x_1, \ldots ,x_{n-1}, z) \implies y = z \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Paucal, multal and other degree quantifiers==
{{See also|Fubini's theorem|measurable}}

None of the quantifiers previously discussed apply to a quantification such as

:There are many integers ''n'' &lt; 100, such that ''n'' is divisible by 2 or 3 or 5.

One possible interpretation mechanism can be obtained as follows: Suppose that in addition to a semantic domain ''X'', we have given a [[probability measure]] P defined on ''X'' and cutoff numbers 0 &lt; ''a'' ≤ ''b'' ≤  1.  If ''A'' is a formula with free variables ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; whose interpretation is
the function ''F'' of variables ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;
then the interpretation of 
:&lt;math&gt; \exists^{\mathrm{many}} x_n A(x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}, x_n) &lt;/math&gt;
is the function of ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt; which is '''T''' if and only if
:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{P} \{w: F(v_1, \ldots, v_{n-1}, w) = \mathbf{T} \} \geq b &lt;/math&gt;
and '''F''' otherwise.  Similarly, the interpretation of 
:&lt;math&gt; \exists^{\mathrm{few}}  x_n  A(x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}, x_n) &lt;/math&gt;
is the function of ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt; which is '''F''' if and only if
:&lt;math&gt; 0&lt; \operatorname{P} \{w: F(v_1, \ldots, v_{n-1}, w) = \mathbf{T}\} \leq a &lt;/math&gt;
and '''T''' otherwise.

==Other quantifiers==
A few other quantifiers have been proposed over time. In particular, the solution quantifier,&lt;ref&gt;[[E. C. R. Hehner|Hehner, Eric C. R.]], 2004, [http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~hehner/aPToP ''Practical Theory of Programming''], 2nd edition, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; noted § ([[section sign]]) and read "those". For example:
:&lt;math&gt; \left [ \S n \in \mathbb{N} \quad n^2 \leq 4 \right ] = \left\{0, 1, 2\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
is read "those ''n'' in '''N''' such that ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ 4 are in {0,1,2}." The same construct is expressible in [[set-builder notation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\{n \in \mathbf N: n^2 \le 4\} =  \left\{0, 1, 2\right\} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Some other quantifiers sometimes used in mathematics include:
*There are infinitely many elements such that...
*For all but finitely many elements... (sometimes expressed as "for almost all elements...").
*There are uncountably many elements such that...
*For all but countably many elements...
*For all elements in a set of positive measure...
*For all elements except those in a set of measure zero...

==History==
[[Term logic]], also called Aristotelian logic, treats quantification in a manner that is closer to natural language, and also less suited to formal analysis. Term logic treated ''All'', ''Some''  and ''No'' in the 4th century BC, in an account also touching on the [[alethic modalities]].

In 1827, [[George Bentham]] published his ''Outline of a new system of logic, with a critical examination of Dr Whately's Elements of Logic'', describing the principle of the quantifier, but the book was not widely circulated.&lt;ref&gt;George Bentham, ''Outline of a new system of logic: with a critical examination of Dr. Whately's Elements of Logic'' (1827); Thoemmes; Facsimile edition (1990)  {{isbn|1-85506-029-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:De Morgan Augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Augustus De Morgan]] (1806-1871) was the first to use "quantifier" in the modern way.]]
[[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]] claimed to have coined the terms "quantify" and "quantification", most likely in his Edinburgh lectures c. 1840. [[Augustus De Morgan]] confirmed this in 1847, but modern usage began with De Morgan in 1862 where he makes statements such as "We are to take in both ''all'' and ''some-not-all'' as quantifiers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=Stanley|last2=Westerståhl|first2=Dag|title=Quantifiers in Language and Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PrYUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA34|date=2006-04-27|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-929125-0|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottlob Frege]], in his 1879 ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'', was the first to employ a quantifier to bind a variable ranging over a [[domain of discourse]] and appearing in [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]s. He would universally quantify a variable (or relation) by writing the variable over a dimple in an otherwise straight line appearing in his diagrammatic formulas. Frege did not devise an explicit notation for existential quantification, instead employing his equivalent of ~∀''x''~, or [[contraposition]]. Frege's treatment of quantification went largely unremarked until [[Bertrand Russell]]'s 1903 ''Principles of Mathematics''.

In work that culminated in Peirce (1885), [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and his student [[Oscar Howard Mitchell]] independently invented universal and existential quantifiers, and [[bound variable]]s. Peirce and Mitchell wrote Π&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and Σ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; where we now write ∀''x'' and ∃''x''. Peirce's notation can be found in the writings of [[Ernst Schröder]], [[Leopold Loewenheim]], [[Thoralf Skolem]], and Polish logicians into the 1950s. Most notably, it is the notation of [[Kurt Gödel]]'s landmark 1930 paper on the [[Gödel's completeness theorem|completeness]] of [[first-order logic]], and 1931 paper on the [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness]] of [[Peano arithmetic]].

Peirce's approach to quantification also influenced [[William Ernest Johnson]] and [[Giuseppe Peano]], who invented yet another notation, namely (''x'') for the universal quantification of ''x'' and (in 1897) ∃''x'' for the existential quantification of ''x''. Hence for decades, the canonical notation in philosophy and mathematical logic was (''x'')''P'' to express "all individuals in the domain of discourse have the property ''P''," and "(∃''x'')''P''" for "there exists at least one individual in the domain of discourse having the property ''P''." Peano, who was much better known than Peirce, in effect diffused the latter's thinking throughout Europe. Peano's notation was adopted by the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' of [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]], and [[Alonzo Church]]. In 1935, [[Gentzen]] introduced the ∀ symbol, by analogy with Peano's ∃ symbol. ∀ did not become canonical until the 1960s.

Around 1895, Peirce began developing his [[existential graph]]s, whose variables can be seen as tacitly quantified. Whether the shallowest instance of a variable is even or odd determines whether that variable's quantification is universal or existential. (Shallowness is the contrary of depth, which is determined by the nesting of negations.) Peirce's graphical logic has attracted some attention in recent years by those researching [[heterogeneous reasoning]] and [[logical graph|diagrammatic inference]].

The '''Rogozen Treasure''' ({{lang-bg|Рогозенско съкровище}}), called the find of the century, is a Thracian treasure.{{sfn|Marazov|1989|page=12}}

== Discovery ==

It was discovered by chance in July 1985 by a tractor driver digging a well in his garden in the [[Bulgaria]]n village of [[Rogozen]].{{sfn|Marazov|1989|pages=11–12}}{{sfn|Eisenberg|1998|p=14}}

== Description ==

It consists of 165 receptacles, including 108 [[Phiale (libation vessel)|phiales]], 55 [[jug (container)|jug]]s and 3 [[goblet]]s.{{sfn|Marazov|1989|page=12}} The objects are silver with golden gilt on some of them with total weight of more than 20&amp;nbsp;kg. The treasure is an invaluable source of information for the life of the [[Thracians]], due to the variety of motifs in the richly decorated objects. It is dated back to the 5th–4th centuries B.C.

==Honour==
[[Rogozen Island]] off [[Robert Island]], [[South Shetland Islands]] is named after the settlement of Rogozen in connection with the Rogozen Treasure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=136731 Rogozen Island] [https://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/ SCAR Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"The Gnarly Man"''' is a  [[science fiction]] story by American writer [[L. Sprague de Camp]], about an apparently immortal [[Neanderthal]] Man surviving into the present day.

==Publication history==
The story was first published in the magazine ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]'' for June, 1939 and first appeared in book form in de Camp's collection ''[[The Wheels of If and Other Science Fiction]]'' ([[Shasta Publishers|Shasta]], 1948).&lt;ref name="laughlin"&gt;Laughlin, Charlotte, and Levack, Daniel J. H. ''De Camp: An L. Sprague de Camp Bibliography''. San Francisco, Underwood/Miller, 1983, pages 168-169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISFDb"&gt;{{isfdb title|id=52284|title=The Gnarly Man}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later appeared in the subsequent de Camp collections ''[[The Best of L. Sprague de Camp]]'' ([[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 1978),  ''[[Aristotle and the Gun and Other Stories]]'' (Five Star, 2002), and ''[[Years in the Making: the Time-Travel Stories of L. Sprague de Camp]]'' ([[NESFA Press]], 2005).&lt;ref name="laughlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ISFDb"/&gt;

The story has also appeared in the magazines ''[[Fantastic Story Magazine]]'' for July, 1953 and ''[[Jim Baen's Universe]]'' for April, 2007, and the anthologies ''[[Human?]]'' (Lion Books, 1954), ''[[The Unknown (1963 anthology)|The Unknown]]'' ([[Jove Books|Pyramid Books]], 1963), ''[[The Freak Show (anthology)|The Freak Show]]'' ([[Rapp &amp; Whiting]], 1970), ''[[Isaac Asimov Presents The Great SF Stories 1 (1939)|The Great Science Fiction Stories Volume 1, 1939]]'' ([[DAW Books]], 1979), ''[[Dawn of Time]]'' ([[Elsevier|Elsevier/Nelson Books]], 1979), ''[[Isaac Asimov Presents The Golden Years of Science Fiction: 36 Stories and Novellas|Isaac Asimov Presents The Golden Years of Science Fiction]]'' (Bonanza Books, 1983), ''[[Neanderthals (anthology)|Neanderthals]]'' ([[New American Library|Signet/NEL]], 1987), ''[[Unknown Worlds: Tales from Beyond]]'' ([[Galahad Books]], 1988), ''[[Modern Classics of Fantasy]]'' ([[St. Martin's Press]], 1997), and ''[[My Favorite Fantasy Story]]'' ([[DAW Books]], 2000).&lt;ref name="laughlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ISFDb"/&gt; The story has been translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]],&lt;ref name="laughlin"/&gt; [[French language|French]],&lt;ref name="laughlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ISFDb"/&gt; [[German language|German]]&lt;ref name="laughlin"/&gt; and [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref name="ISFDb"/&gt;

==Plot summary==
Visiting a freak show, scientist Dr. Matilda Sandler takes an interest in the ape-man "Ungo-Bungo", who appears to exhibit genuine atavistic features. After the show she goes backstage and meets the man behind the role to ask if he will agree to be examined for scientific purposes. Ungo-Bungo, who calls himself Clarence Aloysius Gaffney, proves affable but reticent about his past and reluctant to submit to examination. In time, however, he warily consents in return for surgery to correct some old injuries.

Eventually it comes out that Gaffney is actually Shining Hawk, a Neanderthal Man over 50,000 years old, whose aging process was frozen early in life when he was struck by lightning. He had survived by his wits on the periphery of human society since the extinction of his own kind, using a succession of false identities and getting by as a blacksmith or in menial professions like his present one. He has been a witness to much of history from the margins, making little personal impact on it—though it is suggested that he may have been the original basis for the tales of the divine lame blacksmith [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] (his leg injury is very old).

As it happens, however, Gaffney's caution proves well-founded; not only does Sandler develop an unwelcome crush on him, but the revelation of his secret brings out the worst in some of the scientists to whom it is confided. Discovering that the surgeon who is to perform his operation secretly intends to dissect him, Gaffney skips out. Later, from an undisclosed location, he sends his apologies and regrets to those who have befriended and aided him.

==Reception==
According to [[Sam Moskowitz]], the story "broke ground for an entirely new approach on the treatment of such material,"&lt;ref name="Moskowitz1"&gt;Moskowitz, Sam. "L. Sprague de Camp: Sword and Satire," in ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', v. 38, no. 2, February 1964, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moskowitz2"&gt;Moskowitz, Sam. ''[[Seekers of Tomorrow|Seekers of Tomorrow: Masters of Modern Science Fiction]]'' (New York : [[Ballantine Books]], 1967), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; which was "most notably emulated by [[Philip José Farmer]] in '[[The Alley Man]]'."&lt;ref name="Moskowitz2"/&gt;

[[Don D'Ammassa]] wrote "[t]he forthrightly sentimental "The Gnarly Man" is one of the most moving portraits ever to appear in the [science fiction] field."&lt;ref&gt;D'Ammassa, Don. "de Camp, L. Sprague" in ''[[Twentieth-Century Science-Fiction Writers]]'', Third Edition, Noelle Watson, Paul E. Schellinger, eds. (Chicago: [[Gale (publisher)|St. James Press]], c1991), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Robert Wilfred Franson called the work "a good specimen of the distinct category of stories about Neanderthal Man in science fiction (or fantasy if you prefer)." He notes it "is a humorous story, but it may make you think even while you're enjoying it," and observes that "[d]e Camp obviously has fun here thinking through the likely practical concerns of someone living so long." He rates "[t]he character of Clarence [as] very well sketched in the space of a novelet," going on to say "[h]e brings to my mind a comparison with the title character, a speaking gorilla, in [[Daniel Quinn]]'s novel ''[[Ishmael (novel)|Ishmael]]''. The advantage is all Clarence's, as he is a man; whereas poor Ishmael is an ideological mouthpiece."&lt;ref&gt;Franson, Robert Wilfred. "[http://www.troynovant.com/Franson/DeCamp/Gnarly-Man.html The Gnarly Man by L. Sprague de Camp]" (review) on troynovant.com, Dec. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to other works==
De Camp wrote that he got the subject for the story from his friend [[P. Schuyler Miller]], who was also writing a story about a Neanderthal man in modern times. The Miller piece, "Old Man Mulligan," appeared in the December, 1940 issue of ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science-Fiction]]''. De Camp noted that the two stories were completely different, and used the incident to illustrate the principle that two science fiction writers, using the same idea, will write different stories, so there is nothing wrong with copying someone else's idea.&lt;ref&gt;De Camp, L. Sprague. ''[[Science-Fiction Handbook]]'', New York : Hermitage House, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Camp, L. Sprague. "On The Gnarly Man and Old Man Mulligan." In ''Amra'', v. 2, no. 15, May 1961, pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Camp also featured Neanderthals in his later fantasy novel ''[[The Pixilated Peeress]]'' (1991). In the parallel world of that novel the species forms a relict population pushed by humanity into the higher elevations of the Alps. The fugitive hero Thorolf Zigramson takes refuge among a tribe of these "trolls," as they are known, and is adopted into their society and aided by them.

==Importance==
"The Gnarly Man" is one of de Camp's most notable works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.locusmag.com/2000/News/News11a.html "Locus Online News: L. Sprague de Camp, 1907 - 2000"]&lt;/ref&gt; The story's popularity has been demonstrated by frequent reprinting and anthologization.

'''''The History of The Hobbit''''' is a two-volume study of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]’s ''[[The Hobbit]]''. It was published by [[HarperCollins]] in May and June 2007 in the United Kingdom, with both volumes released in the United States by [[Houghton Mifflin]] on 21 September 2007; a boxed set combining ''The Hobbit'' with ''The History of'' The Hobbit was released on 26 October 2007. A single volume edition was released on 27 October 2011.

The two-volume work contains Tolkien’s unpublished drafts of the novel, with commentary by John D. Rateliff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.forodrim.org/arda/tbchron.html | title = A chronological bibliography of the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien | date = 1 September 2002 | origyear = 16 March 1996 | first = Åke | last = Bertenstam }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also details Tolkien’s various revisions to ''The Hobbit'', including abandoned revisions for the unpublished third edition of the work, intended for 1960, as well as previously unpublished original maps and illustrations drawn by Tolkien himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/historyofthehobbit2.htm | title = History of the Hobbit: An essential resource book for the forthcoming movie adaptation of The Hobbit | date = 13 October 2006 | publisher = Tolkien Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
''The History of'' The Hobbit: ''Volume I: Mr. Baggins''. This contains the first half of Tolkien’s draft material for ''The Hobbit'', along with commentary. It was published in the UK on 4 May 2007.

''The History of'' The Hobbit: ''Volume II: Return to Bag-End'', contains the last half of Tolkien’s original manuscript draft, with commentary and later drafts and appendices. It volume was published in the UK on 18 June 2007.

==Relationship to ''The History of Middle-earth''==
When [[Christopher Tolkien]] began publishing ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', a twelve-volume series documenting J. R. R. Tolkien’s creative writing process in the creation of [[Middle-earth]], with texts dating from the 1910s to the 1990s, he made a conscious decision not to issue a volume detailing the creation of ''The Hobbit''. According to him, ''The Hobbit'' was not originally a part of the Middle-earth universe and was attached to his father's earlier, far darker [[legendarium]] only superficially, although the existence of ''The Hobbit'' forever altered the legendarium.

As Christopher Tolkien was not going to embark on a published study of ''The Hobbit'', the task was given to Taum Santoski in the 1980s. Santoski had connections to the [[Marquette University|Marquette]] collection of Tolkien material, which is where the original manuscripts reside. He died in 1991, and ultimately the task passed to John Rateliff. Although Christopher Tolkien did not work directly on ''The History of The Hobbit'', the work is in a very similar vein to the "literary archaeology" of his ''History of Middle-earth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/booksbytolkien/historyofme/description.htm | title = Books by J.R.R.Tolkien - The History of Middle-earth | work = Tolkien Library }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rateliff submitted a finished draft of the book to Christopher Tolkien, who, approving of the work, gave ''The History of The Hobbit'' his personal blessing to be published in association with his father’s other works.

'''Träskor''' are Swedish [[clog]]s. Swedish clogs are usually made from [[alder]], but some times [[birch]] or [[pine]] is used.{{sfn|Nordisk familjebok|1920}}  Clogs are mainly manufactured in the southern part of the country, both as handicrafts and in factories.  In 1905 there were 22 factories employing 241 people.{{sfn|Nordisk familjebok|1920}}  One manufacturer is based in [[Vollsjö]] in [[Skåne]], clogs for business use are therefore branded "Vollsjö slippers".


The most common model in Sweden is one with soles made of wood and uppers of leather.{{sfn|Klox|2006}} Older models are usually entirely of wood, painted to mimic leather or are sometimes richly painted with floral motifs.

==Bishopric==

'''Verbosity''' or '''verboseness''' is speech or writing that uses more words than necessary (for example, using "Despite the fact that" instead of "Although").&lt;ref name="communitycollege" /&gt; The opposite of verbosity is [[plain language]].
Some teachers, including the author of ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', warn writers not to be verbose. Similarly, some authors, including [[Mark Twain]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]], are known for their avoidance of verbosity. 

Synonyms for verbosity include '''wordiness''', '''verbiage''', '''prolixity''', '''grandiloquence''', '''garrulousness''', '''expatiation''', '''logorrhea''', and '''sesquipedalianism'''. 

Examples of verbosity are common in political speech, academic prose, and other genres.

==Etymology and synonyms==
The word ''verbosity'' comes from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''verbosus'', "wordy". There are many other English words that also refer to the use of excessive words.

''Prolixity'' comes from Latin ''prolixus'', "extended". ''Prolixity'' can also be used to refer to the length of a [[monologue]] or speech, especially a formal address such as a lawyer's [[oral argument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Percy Anecdotes |last=Percy |first=Sholto |authorlink= Joseph Clinton Robertson |author2=Reuben Percy  |year=1826 |publisher=T. Boys |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SzJEAAAAIAAJ |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Grandiloquence'' is complex speech or writing judged to be pompous or bombastic [[diction]]. It is a combination of the Latin words ''grandis'' ("great") and ''loqui'' ("to speak").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/grandiloquence |title=Dictionary.com - Grandiloquence |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Logorrhea'' or ''logorrhoea'' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] λογόρροια, ''logorrhoia'', "[[word]]-[[flux]]") is an excessive flow of words. It is often used [[pejorative]]ly to describe prose that is hard to understand because it is needlessly complicated or uses excessive jargon. The term is also sometimes applied to unnecessarily wordy speech in general.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

''Sesquipedalianism'' is a linguistic style that involves the use of long words. Roman poet [[Horace]] coined the phrase ''sesquipedalia verba'' in his [[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0064%3Acard%3D73 |title=Ars Poetica, l.97 |publisher=[[Perseus Project]] |accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''sesqui'', "one and a half", and ''pes'', "[[Foot (prosody)|foot]]", a reference to [[Meter (poetry)|meter]]. The earliest recorded usage in English of ''sesquipedalian'' is in 1656, and of ''sesquipedalianism'', 1863.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Simpson |first =J. A. |last2=Weiner |first2=E. S. C. |title=The Oxford English Dictionary (Second Edition) |year=1989 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Garrulous'' comes from Latin ''garrulus'', "talkative", a form of the verb ''garrīre'', "to chatter". The adjective may describe a person who is excessively talkative, especially about trivial matters, or a speech that is excessively wordy or diffuse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/garrulous |title=Dictionary.com - Garrulous |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The noun ''expatiation'' and the verb ''expatiate'' come from Latin ''expatiātus'', past participle from ''spatiārī'', "to wander". They refer to enlarging a discourse, text, or description.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/expatiation |title=Dictionary.com - expatiation |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|accessdate=2013-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific jargon==
The word ''logorrhea'' is often used [[pejorative]]ly to describe highly [[figurative language|abstract]] prose that contains little [[Literal and figurative language|concrete language]]. Since abstract writing is hard to visualize, it often seems confusing or excessive. Works in academic fields that involve many abstract ideas, such as [[philosophy]], often fail to include extensive concrete examples of their ideas.
 
In an attempt to prove that "logorrhea" accompanies a lack of academic rigor, physics professor [[Alan Sokal]] wrote a nonsensical essay, and had it published in a respected journal (''[[Social Text]]'') as a [[practical joke]]. The journal defended the article as genuine even after Sokal denounced his own article publicly. The episode has come to be known as the [[Sokal Affair]].&lt;ref name="Sokal"&gt;[http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/ The Sokal Affair]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is sometimes also applied to unnecessarily wordy speech in general; this is more usually referred to as ''prolixity''. Some people defend the use of additional words as [[idiom]]atic, a matter of artistic preference, or helpful in explaining complex ideas or messages.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Examples==
[[Warren G. Harding]], the 29th [[President of the United States]], was notably verbose even in his era. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}} A Democratic leader, [[William Gibbs McAdoo]], described Harding's speeches as "an army of pompous phrases moving across the landscape in search of an idea."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/warrenharding|title=Warren G. Harding|publisher=The White House|accessdate=2013-01-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726020027/http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/warrenharding|archive-date=2012-07-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Robert C. Byrd]] (Democrat, of [[West Virginia]]) lost his position as [[Majority Leader]] in 1989 because his colleagues felt his speeches, which often employed obscure [[allusion]]s to [[ancient Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], were not an asset to the [[Party politics|party base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-05-22-byrd-fight-GOP_x.htm |title=At 87, Byrd Faces Re-election Battle of His Career |date=2005-05-22|accessdate=2014-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Michigan Law Review]]'' published a 229-page parody of postmodern writing titled "Pomobabble: Postmodern Newspeak and Constitutional 'Meaning' for the Uninitiated". The article consists of complicated and context-sensitive self-referencing narratives. The text is peppered with number of parenthetical citations and asides, which is supposed to mock the cluttered style of postmodern writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arrow|first=Dennis W.|title=Pomobabble: Postmodern Newspeak and Constitutional "Meaning" for the Uninitiated|journal=Michigan Law Review|date=December 1997|volume=96|issue=3|pages=461–690|jstor=1290146|doi=10.2307/1290146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The King's English]]'', Fowler gives a passage from ''[[The Times]]'' as an example of verbosity: "''The Emperor'' received yesterday and to-day General Baron von Beck.... It may therefore be assumed with some confidence that the terms of a feasible solution are maturing themselves in ''His Majesty's'' mind and may form the basis of further negotiations with Hungarian party leaders when ''the Monarch'' goes again to Budapest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fowler|first1=Henry Watson|last2=Fowler|first2=Francis George|title=The King's English|year=1908|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fowler objected to this passage because ''The Emperor'', ''His Majesty'', and ''the Monarch'' all refer to the same person: "the effect", he pointed out in ''Modern English Usage'', "is to set readers wondering what the significance of the change is, only to conclude that there is none."

While verbosity may be rhetorically useful&lt;ref name="communitycollege"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roanestate.edu/owl/clutter.html |title=Removing Word Clutter |work=Roane State}}&lt;/ref&gt; verbose parts in communications are sometimes referred to as "fluff" or "fuzz".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Simplicity |title=On writing well: An informal guide to writing nonfiction |location=New York |publisher=Harper &amp; Row|author=[[William Zinsser]] |url=http://cgiss.boisestate.edu/~billc/Writing/zinsser.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Greek philosopher [[Callimachus]] is quoted as saying "Big book, big evil" (μέγα βιβλίον μέγα κακόν, ''mega biblion, mega kakon''), rejecting the [[Epic poetry|epic]] style of [[poetry]] in favor of his own.

[[William Strunk]], an American professor of English advised in 1918 to "Use the active voice: Put statements in positive form; Omit needless words."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strunk|first=William|title=The Elements of Style|year=1918|publisher=Feedbooks|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' (1926) [[Henry Watson Fowler]] says, "It is the second-rate writers, those intent rather on expressing themselves prettily than on conveying their meaning clearly, &amp; still more those whose notions of style are based on a few misleading rules of thumb, that are chiefly open to the allurements of [[elegant variation]]," Fowler's term for the over-use of [[synonym]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Henry Watson|title=A Dictionary of Modern English Usage|year=1994|publisher=Wordsworth Editions|isbn=978-1-85326-318-7|origyear=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to Fowler's criticism of several words being used to name the same thing in English [[prose]], in some other languages, including [[French language|French]], it might be thought to be a good writing style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Translation And Creativity: Perspectives on Creative Writing And Translation Studies |chapter=Painting with words |editor=Eugenia Loffredo, Manuela Perteghella |first=Ann |last=Paterson |year=2006 |isbn=0-8264-8793-9 |page=88 |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]]|quote=. . . the rule of ''elegant variation'' (that is, using synonyms wherever possible), which purists consider to be essential for good style in French.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Translator's Handbook: (with special reference to conference translation from French and Spanish) |first=Frederick |last=Fuller |year=1984 |isbn=0-271-00368-5 |page=35 |publisher=[[Penn State University Press]] |quote=''Elegant variation'' French tends to avoid repetition of proper names, with a description of the person, at second reference.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Twain]] (1835&amp;ndash;1910) wrote "generally, the fewer the words that fully communicate or evoke the intended ideas and feelings, the more effective the communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.search.com/reference/Prolixity |title=Reference for Prolixity |publisher=Search.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716025741/http://www.search.com/reference/Prolixity |archivedate=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernest Hemingway]] (1899–1961), the 1954 [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] for literature, defended his concise style against a charge by [[William Faulkner]] that he "had never been known to use a word that might send the reader to the dictionary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1= Rovit|first1=Earl|last2=Waldhorn|first2=Arthur|title=Hemingway and Faulkner in Their Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9zRLAq6eBS4C&amp;pg=PA162|accessdate=28 February 2011|year=2006|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-1825-8|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemingway responded by saying, "Poor [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]]. Does he really think big emotions come from big words? He thinks I don't know the ten-dollar words. I know them all right. But there are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Shapiro| first= Fred R.|title= The Yale Book of Quotations| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ck6bXqt5shkC&amp;pg=PA354 |accessdate= 28 February 2011| year= 2006 |publisher= Yale University Press| isbn=0-300-10798-6|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An inquiry into the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|2005 London bombings]] found that verbosity can be dangerous if used by emergency services. It can lead to delay that could cost lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/8374581/77-inquests-emergency-services-should-use-plain-English.html |title=7/7 inquests: emergency services should use plain English|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study from the [[psychology]] department of [[Princeton University]] found that using long and obscure words does not make people seem more intelligent. Dr. Daniel M. Oppenheimer did research which showed that students rated short, concise texts as being written by the most intelligent authors. But those who used long words or complex [[font]] types were seen as less intelligent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oppenheimer|first=Daniel M.|url=http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/psy3001/files/simple%20writing.pdf|format=PDF|year=2005|title=Consequences of Erudite Vernacular Utilized Irrespective of Necessity: Problems with using long words needlessly|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|volume=20|pages=139–15|doi=10.1002/acp.1178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Hamlet]]'', one of [[Polonius]]'s many [[sententiae|sententious]] maxims reads {{quote|Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,&lt;br&gt;And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,&lt;br&gt;I will be brief.}}
Shakespeare's audiences were not necessarily inclined to read Polonius as someone who is perfectly wise; his sentences, like that of much early modern drama, can easily be seen as part of a comic trope.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[George Orwell]] mocked logorrhea in "[[Politics and the English Language]]" (1946) by taking verse (9:11) from the book of [[Ecclesiastes]] in the [[Bible]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and rewriting it as

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quantum physicist [[Richard Feynman]] has also spoken out against verbosity in scientific writing. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feynman |first=Richard |date=Nov 1, 1992 |title=Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman |publisher=Vintage Random House |page=9 |isbn= |accessdate=Jan 5, 2015 |quote='his almost compulsive need to solve puzzles, his provocative mischievousness, his indignant impatience with pretension and hypocrisy, and his talent for one-upping anybody who tries to one-up him'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|title=My friend Richard Feynman |first=Leonard

[[Image:Wayne and Shuster.jpg|thumb|Wayne and Shuster before a performance in France, 1944]]
'''Wayne and Shuster''' were a Canadian [[double act|comedy duo]] formed by [[Johnny Wayne]] and [[Frank Shuster]]. They were active professionally from the early 1940s until the late 1980s, first as a live act, then on radio, then as part of ''The Army Show'' that entertained troops in Europe during [[World War II]], and then on both Canadian and American television.

Wayne (born Louis Weingarten; May 28, 1918 – July 18, 1990) and Shuster (September 5, 1916 – January 13, 2002) were well known in Canada, and were [[Ed Sullivan]]'s most frequently recurring guests, appearing a record 67 times on [[The Ed Sullivan Show|his show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/most-frequent-ed-sullivan-show-guests/|title=The Most Frequent Ed Sullivan Show Guests - Ed Sullivan Show|website=www.edsullivan.com|accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite repeated suggestions that they should move to the United States to further their careers, the duo chose to stay in Canada.

==Beginnings==
Wayne and Shuster were born in the same neighbourhood in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, and met in grade school.&lt;ref name="cole"&gt;{{cite book | last =Cole | first =Stephen | title =Here's Looking at Us: Celebrating 50 years of CBC-TV | publisher =McLellan &amp; Stewart | date =2002 | location =Toronto | isbn =0-7710-2251-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20}} In 1931, while students at [[Harbord Collegiate Institute]], they performed their first skit together for their [[Scouts Canada|Boy Scout troop]],&lt;ref name="nash"&gt;{{cite book | last =Nash | first =Knowlton | author-link =Knowlton Nash | title =Cue the Elephants: Backstage Tales at the CBC | publisher =McLelland &amp; Stewart | edition = | date =1996 | location =Toronto | isbn =0-7710-6734-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|142}} and, as part of the school drama club, continued to entertain fellow students. They both studied at the [[University of Toronto]], where they wrote and performed as "Shuster and Wayne".&lt;ref name="benny"&gt;{{Citation | last =Barris  | first =Alex | author-link =Alex Barris | last2 =Bawden | first2 =Jim | title =Frank Shuster Obituaries | publisher =International Jack Benny Fan Club | date =January 14, 2002 | url =http://www.jackbenny.org/biography/obits/frank_shuster_obituaries.htm | access-date = April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio==
[[File:Johnny Wayne and Frank Shuster performing in a CBC radio broadcast of The Army Show Johnny Wayne et Frank Shuster, durant une représentation de The Army Show à la radio de la SRC.jpg|left|thumb|Performing for ''The Army Show'' on CBC Radio during World War II]]In 1941, they made their radio debut on [[CFRB]] in their own show, ''The Javex Wife Preservers'',&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/1958-wayne-and-shuster-debut-on-the-ed-sullivan-show | title =1958: Wayne and Shuster debut on the Ed Sullivan Show | website = CBC Archives | publisher = CBC | access-date =April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which they were each paid $12.50 per week to dispense household hints in a humorous fashion.&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;{{rp|143}}  Their popularity on CFRB, at the time a top-rated Toronto radio station, soon landed the pair on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC)'s [[Trans-Canada Network]] as part of the [[American Tobacco Company|Buckingham Cigarette]] "Blended Rhythm Show".&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;{{rp|143}}

They enlisted in the [[Canadian Army]] in 1942, and were immediately assigned to ''The Canadian Army Radio Show'', which was produced in Montreal.&lt;ref name="cjn"&gt;{{cite news | last =Lungen | first =Paul | title =Wayne and Shuster: the iconic comedy team that delighted audiences for years | newspaper =The Canadian Jewish News  | location =Toronto | date =August 22, 2017 | url =http://www.cjnews.com/culture/canada-150/wayne-shuster-iconic-comedy-team-delighted-audiences-years | access-date = April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;{{rp|144}} Shuster and Wayne wrote most of the music, lyrics and skits, and were part of a cast that featured the singers [[Jimmie Shields]] and Raymonde Maranda. The radio show was a success, resulting in ''The Army Show'', a touring stage version that opened in Toronto in April 1943 to popular acclaim. ''[[Time Magazine]]'' called it ''"a high-spirited, always likeable, often lavish soldier show... Two Toronto sergeants, 26-year-old Frank Shuster and 24-year-old Johnny Wayne, had authored a peppy book, some perky tunes and lyrics."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The Theater: Canadian Capers | newspaper =Time | location =New York | date =April 19, 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The revue travelled across Canada in 1943 to entertain troops and help with the sale of [[War bond#World War II|Victory Bonds]], and included a stop at the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]].&lt;ref name=army&gt;{{cite book | last =Stephens | first =W. Ray | title =The Canadian Entertainers of World War II | publisher =Mosaic Press/International Publishers | date =1993 | location =Oakville, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Shuster and Wayne, the cast included the singer [[Roger Doucet]], Brian and [[Dennis Farnon]], [[The Denny Vaughan Show|Denny Vaughan]], and [[Lois Maxwell|Lois Hooker]] (who later, as Lois Maxwell, starred as [[Miss Moneypenny]] in fourteen [[James Bond]] films).&lt;ref name=army /&gt; In late 1943, the revue was split up into five units and sent to England to entertain troops. Shuster and Wayne again prepared most of the material for all the units, and were assigned to a unit that followed Canadian troops into France following [[D-Day]]. The duo often performed close enough to the front lines that they had to contend with snipers, strafing and even a relatively close encounter with an exploding [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1 "buzz bomb"]].&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;{{rp|143}}

After [[demobilization]], Shuster and Wayne returned to Toronto and started ''The RCA Victor Show'' on CBC Radio.&lt;ref name="cc"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/publications/archivist-magazine/015002-2131-e.html | title =The Archivist: Wayne &amp; Shuster | website = Collections Canada | publisher = Library and Archives Canada | access-date =April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An advertising executive suggested that "Wayne &amp; Shuster" sounded better than "Shuster &amp; Wayne". Since the order of their names wasn't important to the two, they agreed to the change.&lt;ref name =benny /&gt; ([[Alex Barris]] later recalled that they had a CBC office with two doors — one read "Wayne &amp; Shuster", the other was "Shuster &amp; Wayne".)&lt;ref name=benny /&gt; Their popularity rapidly grew and CBC changed the name of their radio programme to ''The Wayne &amp; Shuster Show.''&lt;ref name =cc /&gt; By 1950, their Canadian weekly audience numbered 3 million.&lt;ref name=benny /&gt; They also began to make a name for themselves in the U.S. when they were hired to make a radio network series to replace [[William Bendix]]'s ''The Life of Riley'' while it was on summer hiatus in 1947.&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;{{rp|144}}

==Television==
[[File:thomson_wayne_shuster.png|thumb|left|Wayne &amp; Shuster with actress [[Lorraine Thomson]] during a live CBC broadcast in 1961]]Wayne &amp; Shuster first appeared on television in 1950, but not in Canada, which did not have network TV until 1952. Their radio sponsor, Toni Home Permanent, also sponsored an American television show, ''Toni Twin Time'', hosted by [[Jack Lemmon]].&lt;ref name=benny /&gt; The sponsor asked the duo to make regular appearances on the TV program, which was not doing well. After two shows, a sponsor executive asked them to take over the hosting duties from Lemmon, who was young, inexperienced, and obviously nervous. However, they were unsure about this new medium of television, and turned down the offer.&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;{{rp|144}}

In 1952, CBC producer [[Mavor Moore]] approached them about doing a regular live comedy show on the new CBC Television network, but after watching [[Milton Berle]] dealing with all of the details of lighting, sound, music and audience while broadcasting live from New York City, the two were even more concerned about the demands of live television. They agreed to make an appearance in one CBC television show in 1952 in Montreal, but turned down the opportunity to produce a regular show in Toronto. Wayne said, "You guys don't know anything about television. We don't either. Why don't we wait until we both know something about it?"&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;{{rp|145}}

Two years later, in 1954, they finally agreed to host a regular comedy show on CBC.&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;{{rp|145}} In 1955, on one of their shows, they presented a mock-Shakespearean sketch called "Rinse the Blood Off My Toga",&lt;ref name=cc /&gt; which they also presented on British television the same year.&lt;ref name=cole /&gt;{{rp|20}} A literate mash-up of [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Mickey Spillane]], the sketch featured a hard-boiled Roman [[Private investigator|private eye]] hired by [[Brutus]] to investigate the murder of [[Julius Caesar]] on the [[Ides of March]]. As with many of their scripts, "Rinse the Blood Off My Toga" assumed the audience had a working knowledge of history, Shakespeare, and sometimes even Latin. In 1958, after the opening of the [[Stratford Festival of Canada]] in 1958, they created "A Shakespearean Baseball Game", written in iambic pentameter and rhyming couplets, and featuring lines lifted from ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Macbeth]]''. (''"O, what a rogue and bush league slob am I!... O, curséd fate, that I, who led the league, should bat .208."'') In later years, they considered this their favourite script.&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;{{rp|153}}

[[Lorraine Thomson]], who often appeared on their live broadcasts in the 1950s, called their writing "a kind of cross between a more erudite British sense of humour and the more American vaudevillian sense of humour. They treated their audiences with respect."&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;{{rp|147}}

[[File:Wayne and Shuster Ed Sullivan 1963.JPG|thumb|right|The Mounties get their man when Ed Sullivan brought his show to Toronto in 1963.]]In 1958, they signed a one-year contract with [[Ed Sullivan]] to appear regularly on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' for $7500 a show;&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;{{rp|149}} that included a handshake agreement that Sullivan would not cut or edit their sketches, which tended to run 12 minutes or longer;&lt;ref name="playback"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://playbackonline.ca/2008/05/26/wayneshuster-20080526/ | title =Wayne and Shuster: Duo were Canada's comedy ambassadors | last =Glassman | first =Wayne | date =May 26, 2008 | website =Playback | access-date =April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; their first sketch was an 14-minute re-run of the sketch they had done for CBC and British television, "Rinse the Blood Off My Toga".&lt;ref name=archive /&gt; (Singer [[Eartha Kitt]] once asked Frank Shuster, "What have you got on Ed Sullivan?" after Sullivan cut one of her songs from a program, but left Wayne &amp; Shuster's 12-minute sketch intact.)&lt;ref name=playback /&gt; The only time Sullivan asked for an edit was in order to remove a joke about Southern lynchings; he was worried about offending network stations in the Southern U.S.&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;{{rp|150}} Sullivan loved the Canadian duo and renewed their contract repeatedly; they appeared on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' a record 67 times over the next 11 years.&lt;ref name=archive /&gt; Frank Shuster later disputed this, telling TV critic Jim Bawden that "We were on Ed 58 times. The record books say 67, but that's wrong."&lt;ref name=benny /&gt;

Ed Sullivan advised the two, despite their success in the U.S., to remain in Toronto.&lt;ref name=cjn /&gt; They took his advice and turned down many offers to move to the United States permanently. In later years, Shuster often told the story of one agent who tried to get them to move to Hollywood, insisting, "You know, Frank, there's more to life than happiness."&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;{{rp|152}}

Regardless of their home address, in 1962, and again in 1963, they were ranked as the best comedy routine in America by Motion Picture Daily and Television Today,&lt;ref name="cwof"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductees/1999/wayne-and-shuster | title =Wayne and Shuster | website = Canada's Walk of Fame | access-date =April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and co-starred in a [[CBS]]-TV sitcom, ''[[Holiday Lodge]]'', which aired as a summer replacement for [and was produced by] [[Jack Benny]] in 1961.

In 1964, Wayne &amp; Shuster created a series of six short documentaries for CBS about comedians such as [[W. C. Fields]] and the [[Marx Brothers]], with music scored by [[John Williams]], titled ''Wayne &amp; Shuster Take an Affectionate Look at...''. They made another six episodes the following year.&lt;ref name="tva"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.tvarchive.ca/database/18984/wayne_and_shuster_show,_the/episode_guide/ | title =Episode Guide - Wayne and Shuster Show, The | website =TVArchive.ca | access-date =April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 ''The Wayne &amp; Shuster Hour'' won the Silver Rose at the [[Rose d'Or]] Television Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/programming/television/wayne-shuster-show-0 | title =Wayne &amp; Shuster Show, The | website = History of Canadian Broadcasting| publisher =Canadian Communications Foundation | access-date =April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, they moved from a weekly television show to monthly ''Wayne &amp; Shuster'' comedy specials on [[CBC Television]]. By the 1970s, they were producing three to four comedy specials per year, which often drew Canadian television ratings of more than two million viewers.&lt;ref name=cole /&gt;{{rp|135}}

Wayne  and Shuster's skits often employed large casts of characters, and supporting players included Canadian actors Don Cullen, [[Jack Duffy]], Tom Harvey, Bill Kemp, Paul Kligman, Ben Lennick, [[Sylvia Lennick]], Peggi Loder, Les Rubie, [[Eric Christmas]], Joe Austin, [[Larry D. Mann|Larry Mann]], [[Paul Soles]], Marilyn Stuart, Roy Wordsworth, John Davies, Carol Robinson, Lou Pitoscia, Peggy Mahon, Don Ewer and [[Keith Hampshire]]. For many years, their music director was Canadian jazz artist [[Norman Amadio]].

Wayne and Shuster were infamous for their vociferous arguments during scriptwriting sessions, television production and editing sessions.&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;{{rp|137}}&lt;ref name=cjn /&gt;&lt;ref name=benny /&gt; Wayne especially was particularly exacting during production and often took the studio crew to task for perceived faults.&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;{{rp|142}} The technicians often responded by refusing to work overtime at the end of the day.&lt;ref name = nash /&gt;{{rp|142}} During one sketch, some crew members were instructed to throw fruit and vegetables at both of the comedians from off-camera. Instead, the crew only hurled fruit at Wayne.&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;{{rp|138}} One floor director remembered Wayne as "two people. On the [studio] floor he was a son of a bitch, but outside he was one of the nicest guys you could meet."&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;{{rp|138}} Despite their temperamental reputation in the studio, both were friendly, thoughtful and welcoming outside of work.&lt;ref name=cjn /&gt;

Because of their combative natures in the studio, the two agreed early on to not mix socially. Shortly after their CBC radio show became popular, Wayne told Shuster that he was organizing a party, but that he wasn't going to invite his partner "because we're always together and we'll start in about the business. So, to hell with that."&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;{{rp|141}} Shuster agreed, and from that point on, they led completely separate lives away from work, with different interests and hobbies.&lt;ref name=benny /&gt;

==Later career==
By the late 1970s, critics were calling their comedy irrelevant and out of date, but their Canadian TV ratings remained strong. In 1980, CBC re-packaged their material into 80 half-hour specials that were syndicated worldwide.&lt;ref name=archive /&gt;

The pair continued to produce comedy specials until Wayne's death from cancer in 1990. After Wayne's death, Shuster went back into the editing suite and from almost 40 years of their television shows, produced a retrospective series of twenty-two shows, which he also hosted.&lt;ref name=nash /&gt;{{rp|153}} In 1999, three years before his death, he hosted a one-hour compendium of their work, "Wayne &amp; Shuster: The First Hundred Years".&lt;ref name=benny /&gt;

== Awards ==

In 2000, Australian music group [[The Avalanches]] created a track called "[[Frontier Psychiatrist]]", which was built on various samples of previously recorded material, most noticeably the Wayne &amp; Shuster sketch "Frontier Psychiatrist".&lt;ref name="album notes"&gt;(2001) Album notes for Since I Left You by The Avalanches [Digipak inside sleeve.]. Sire / Modular (31177-2).&lt;/ref&gt; (Audio clips of two other Wayne and Shuster sketches were also used in creating the track, along with samples of dozens of pieces of music.)&lt;ref name="album notes"/&gt; "Frontier Psychiatrist" was released as a single, and became a hit in the UK, reaching No. 18 on the charts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=29203&lt;/ref&gt; Johnny Wayne vocalizes the song's repeated refrain "that boy needs therapy"; both Wayne and Frank Shuster are the featured voices throughout verses one and two.

The '''bibliography of [[William Faulkner]]''', an American writer, includes 19 novels, 125 short stories (not including stories that appear exclusively in novels), 20 screenplays (including uncredited rewrites), one play, six collections of poetry as well as assorted letters and essays.

Faulkner made his debut as a published writer at the age of 21 with the [[poem]] "L'Après-midi d'un Faune", which appeared in ''[[The New Republic]]'' on August 6, 1919. Two more poems, "Cathay" and "Sapphics" and a short story, "[[Landing in Luck]]", were published in ''Mississippian'' in November 1919.{{sfn|Fargnoli|Golay|Hamblin|2008|p=461}}

Faulkner's first novel, ''[[Soldiers' Pay]]'', was published in 1926 and his 19th and final, ''[[The Reivers]]'', in 1962, the year he died. Numerous works have been published posthumously.
