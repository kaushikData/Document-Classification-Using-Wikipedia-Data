'''''A Greek–English Lexicon''''', often referred to as '''''Liddell &amp; Scott''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|d|əl}}),&lt;ref&gt;See the verse quoted below. Furthermore, see Naiditch p. 57, where he quotes "a variant of the ''Balliol Rhymes'' (p. 29): 'I am the Dean, and this is Mrs Liddell: / She plays the first, and I the second fiddle.'" {{cite journal|last1=Naiditch|first1=P. G.|title=On Pronouncing the Names of Certain British Classical Scholars|journal=The Classical Journal|date=1993|volume=89|issue=1|pages=55–59|jstor=3297619}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''''Liddell–Scott–Jones''''', or '''''LSJ''''', is a standard [[lexicography|lexicographical]] work of the [[Ancient Greek language]].

==Liddell and Scott's lexicon==
The lexicon was begun in the nineteenth century and is now in its ninth (revised) edition.  Based on the earlier ''Handwörterbuch der griechischen Sprache'' by the German lexicographer [[Franz Passow]] (first published in 1819, fourth edition 1831), which in turn was based on [[Johann Gottlob Schneider]]'s ''Kritisches griechisch-deutsches Handwörterbuch'', it has served as the basis for all later lexicographical work on the ancient Greek language, such as the ongoing Greek–Spanish dictionary project ''[[Diccionario Griego-Español|Diccionario Griego–Español]]'' (DGE).

It was edited by [[Henry Liddell|Henry George Liddell]], [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]], [[Henry Stuart Jones]] and Roderick McKenzie, and published by the [[Oxford University Press]].  It is now conventionally referred to as '''''Liddell &amp; Scott''''', '''''Liddell–Scott–Jones''''', or '''''LSJ''''', and its three sizes are sometimes referred to as "The Little Liddell", "The Middle Liddell" and "The Big Liddell" or "The [[Great Scott]]".

According to Stuart Jones's preface to the ninth (1925) edition, the creation of the ''Lexicon'' was originally proposed by [[David Alphonso Talboys]], an [[Oxford]] publisher.  It was published by the Clarendon Press at Oxford rather than by Talboys because he died before the first edition (1843) was complete. The second through sixth editions appeared in 1845, 1849, 1855, 1861, and 1869.

The first editor of the LSJ, [[Henry George Liddell]], was Dean of [[Christ Church, Oxford]], and the father of [[Alice Liddell]], the eponymous [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] of the writings of [[Lewis Carroll]]. The eighth edition (1897) is the last edition published during Liddell's lifetime.

The LSJ is sometimes compared and contrasted with ''[[A Latin Dictionary]]'' by Lewis and Short, which was also published by Oxford University Press (OUP).  For comparisons between the two works, see the article on Lewis and Short's dictionary. It is also sometimes compared with the [[Bauer lexicon]], which is a similar work focused on the Greek of the [[New Testament]].

Greek scholars use these books so much that two short memorable [[clerihew]]s have been written to describe the seminal work:

1. &lt;poem&gt;Liddell and Scott, Liddell and Scott:
Some of it's riddle, and some of it's rot.
That which is riddle was written by Liddell,
That which is rot was written by Scott.&lt;/poem&gt;

2. &lt;poem&gt;Two men wrote a dictionary, Liddell and Scott,
And one half was good, the other was not.
Now tell me the answer, boys, quick, to this riddle:
which was by Scott and which was by Liddell?&lt;/poem&gt;

==Condensed editions==
Two condensed editions of LSJ were published by Oxford University Press and remain in print.

In 1843, the same year as the full lexicon's publication, ''A Lexicon:  Abridged from Liddell and Scott's Greek–English Lexicon'', sometimes called "the Little Liddell" was published. Several revised editions followed. For example, a reprint, re-typeset in 2007, of the 1909 edition is available from Simon Wallenberg Press ({{ISBN|1-84356-026-7}}).

In 1889, an intermediate edition of the lexicon, ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'', was prepared on the basis of the seventh edition (1882) of LSJ.  In comparison to the smaller abridgement, this "Middle Liddell" contains more entries covering the essential vocabulary of most commonly read Ancient Greek literature, adds citations of the authors to illustrate the history of Greek usage (without identifying the passages), and provides more help with irregular forms.

==The Supplement==
After the publication of the ninth edition in 1940, shortly after the deaths of both Stuart Jones and McKenzie, the OUP maintained a list of ''addenda et corrigenda'' (additions and corrections), which was bound with subsequent printings.  However, in 1968, these were replaced by a Supplement to the LSJ.  Neither the ''addenda'' nor the Supplement has ever been merged into the main text, which still stands as originally composed by Liddell, Scott, Jones, and McKenzie.  The Supplement was initially edited by [[Martin Litchfield West|M. L. West]].  Since 1981, it has been edited by [[P. G. W. Glare]], editor of the ''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]'' (not to be confused with [[A Latin Dictionary|Lewis and Short]]).  Since 1988, it has been edited by Glare and [[Anne A. Thompson]].  As the title page of the ''Lexicon'' makes clear (and the prefaces to the main text and to the Supplement attest), this editorial work has been performed "with the cooperation of many scholars".

The Supplement primarily takes the form of a list of additions and corrections to the main text, sorted by entry.  The supplemental entries are marked with signs to show the nature of the changes they call for.  Thus, a user of the ''Lexicon'' can consult the Supplement after consulting the main text to see whether scholarship after Jones and McKenzie has provided any new information about a particular word.  As of 2005, the most recent revision of the Supplement, published in 1996, contains 320 pages of corrections to the main text, as well as other materials.

Here is a typical entry from the revised Supplement:

:&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; {{lang|grc|&amp;nbsp;ἐκβουτῠπόομαι}} ''to be changed into a [[Dairy cattle|cow]]'', S.''fr''. 269a.37 R.

The small "x" indicates that this word did not appear in the main text at all; "S.''fr''." refers to the collected fragmentary works of [[Sophocles]].

One interesting new source of lexicographic material in the revised Supplement is the [[Mycenean language|Mycenean]] inscriptions.  The 1996 revised Supplement's Preface notes:

:At the time of the publication of the first Supplement it was felt that the [[Michael Ventris|Ventris]] decipherment of the [[Linear B]] tablets was still too uncertain to warrant the inclusion of these texts in a standard dictionary.  Ventris's interpretation is now generally accepted and the tablets can no longer be ignored in a comprehensive Greek dictionary [...].

==Electronic editions==
The ninth edition of LSJ has been freely available in electronic form since 2007, having been digitized by the [[Perseus Project]].  Diogenes, a free software package, incorporates the Perseus data and allows easy offline consultation of LSJ on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/p.j.heslin/Software/Diogenes/ |title=Diogenes |publisher=Dur.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcion (software)|Marcion]] is another open source application&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marcion|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/marcion/|work=SourceForge|accessdate=21 June 2013|author=Vagrantos|date=10 June 2013|quote=GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPLv2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; that includes the Perseus LSJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Konvicka|first=Milan|title=Greek dictionary|url=http://marcion.sourceforge.net/#gkdict|work=Marcion - software to study the Gnostic scriptures|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For mobile devices, both the [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle E-Ink]] and the [[iPhone]]/[[iPod Touch]] feature data ported from Perseus. The [[Android Market]] also currently offers the intermediate LSJ as an offline downloadable app for free&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Greek Lexicon &amp; Syntax|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.benlinskey.greekreference}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for a small price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lighthousedp.com/ |title=Lighthouse Digital Publishing |publisher=Lighthouse Digital Publishing|accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldibex.com/lexiphanes Lexiphanes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214091744/http://www.goldibex.com/lexiphanes |date=February 14, 2010 }}, [http://www.davidfinucane.com/Greek-English-Lexicon/ David Finucane, iPhone Apps] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304144248/http://www.davidfinucane.com/Greek-English-Lexicon/ |date=2012-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://market.android.com/details?id=com.greektext.lexicon&amp;hl=en |title=LSJ Greek Dictionary - Android Apps on Google Play |publisher=Market.android.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[CD-ROM]] version published and sold by [[Logos Bible Software]] also incorporates the Supplement's additions to the ninth edition of LSJ. A new online version of LSJ was released in 2011 by the [[Thesaurus Linguae Graecae]] (TLG). The TLG version corrects "a large number of typographical errors" and includes links to the extensive TLG textual corpus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tlg.uci.edu/lsj/about.php |title=TLG: About the Liddell-Scott-Jones Lexicon |publisher=Tlg.uci.edu |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A Kindle version, the "Complete Liddell &amp; Scott's Lexicon with Inflections", is also available: it allows searches of most Classical Greek word-forms and supports a growing number of Ancient / Classical Greek texts for this device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Liddell-Lexicon-Inflections-ebook/dp/B0092K07BQ|title=Complete Liddell &amp; Scott's Lexicon with Inflections &lt;nowiki&gt;[Kindle Edition]&lt;/nowiki&gt; |ASIN= B0092K07BQ |publisher=Lighthouse Digital Publications|edition=Ninth|date=March 18, 2012 |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==

The Lexicon has been translated into Modern Greek by Anestis Konstantinidis (Greek: Ανέστης Κωνσταντινίδης) and was published in 1904 with the title ''H. Liddell – R. Scott – Α. Κωνσταντινίδου'' – ''Μέγα Λεξικόν τῆς Ἑλληνικῆς Γλώσσης''.

'''Abū Nuwās al-Ḥasan ibn Hānī al-Ḥakamī''' (756–814),&lt;sup id="fn_a_back"&gt;[[#fn a|a]]&lt;/sup&gt; known as '''Abū Nuwās'''&lt;ref name="Gp2"&gt;[[#GA|Garzanti]]&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ar|أبو نواس}}; {{lang-fa|ابو نواس}}, ''Abū Novās''), was a classical [[Arabic poetry|Arabic]] poet. Born in the city of [[Ahvaz]] in [[Sasanian Empire|modern-day Iran]], to an [[Arab]] father and a [[Persian people|Persian]] mother,&lt;ref name="Gp2"/&gt; he became a master of all the contemporary genres of Arabic poetry. Abu Nuwas has also entered the [[folkloric]] tradition, and he appears several times in ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]''.

==Early life; his work==
Abu Nuwas's father, Hānī, whom the poet never knew, was an Arab, a descendant of the [[Jizan Province|Jizani]] tribe [[Banu Hakam]], and a soldier in the army of [[Marwan II]]. His Persian mother, named Jullaban, worked as a weaver. Biographies differ on the date of Abu Nuwas' birth, ranging from 747 to 762. Some sources say he was born at [[Basra]]&lt;ref name="Gp2"/&gt;, but other accounts report he was born in Damascus, Busra, or at Ahwaz.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009|reason=need cites for each of these}} His given name was ''al-Hasan ibn Hani al-Hakami'', 'Abu Nuwas' being a nickname. "Father of the Lock of Hair" referred to the two long sidelocks which hung down to his shoulders.{{Citation needed|date= January 2018}}

Ismail bin Nubakht: "I never saw a man of more extensive learning than Abu Nuwas, nor one who, with a memory so richly furnished, possessed so few books. After his death we searched his house, and could only find one book-cover containing a quire of paper, in which was a collection of rare expressions and grammatical observations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XXciAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=F. F. Arbuthnot, '&amp;#39;Arabic Authors: A Manual of Arabian History and Literature,'&amp;#39; W. Heinemann, London (1890), p. 81. ISBN 3847229052 (reprint) |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2006-12-13 |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exile and imprisonment ==
{{Unreferenced section|date= January 2018}}
Abu Nuwas was forced to flee to [[Egypt]] for a time, after he wrote an elegiac poem praising the elite [[Persia]]n political family of the [[Barmakis]], the powerful family which had been toppled and massacred by the caliph, [[Harun al-Rashid]]. He returned to Baghdad in 809 upon the death of Harun al-Rashid. The subsequent ascension of Muhammad [[al-Amin]], Harun al-Rashid's twenty-two-year-old libertine son (and former student of Abu Nuwas) was a mighty stroke of luck for Abu Nuwas. In fact, most scholars believe that Abu Nuwas wrote most of his poems during the reign of al-Amin (809-813). His most famous royal commission was a poem (a 'qasida') which he composed in praise of al-Amin.

"According to the critics of his time, he was the greatest poet in Islam." wrote F.F. Arbuthnot in ''Arabic Authors''. His contemporary [[Abu Hatim al Mekki]] often said that the deepest meanings of thoughts were concealed underground until Abu Nuwas dug them out.

Nevertheless, Abu Nuwas was imprisoned when his drunken, libidinous exploits tested even al-Amin's patience. Amin was finally [[Fourth Fitna|overthrown]] by his puritanical brother, [[Al-Ma'mun]], who had no tolerance for Abu Nuwas.

Some later accounts claim that fear of prison made Abu Nuwas repent his old ways and become deeply religious, while others believe his later, penitent poems were simply written in hopes of winning the caliph's pardon. It was said that al-Ma'mun's secretary Zonbor tricked Abu Nuwas into writing a satire against [[Ali]], the fourth Caliph and son-in-law of the Prophet, while Nuwas was drunk. Zonbor then deliberately read the poem aloud in public, and ensured Nuwas's continuing imprisonment. Depending on which biography is consulted, Abu Nuwas either died in prison or was poisoned by Ismail bin Abu Sehl, or both.

== Legacy ==
Abu Nuwas is considered one of the greats of classical Arabic literature.{{Citation needed|date= January 2018}} He influenced many later writers, to mention only [[Omar Khayyám]], and [[Hafez|Hafiz]] — both of them Persian poets.{{Citation needed|date= January 2018}} A hedonistic caricature of Abu Nuwas appears in several of the [[Thousand and One Nights]] tales.{{Citation needed|date= January 2018}} Among his best known poems are the ones ridiculing the "Olde Arabia" nostalgia for the life of the Bedouin, and enthusiastically praising the up-to-date life in Baghdad as a vivid contrast.{{Citation needed|date= January 2018}} He is one of various people credited with inventing the literary form of the ''[[Riddles (Arabic)|mu‘ammā]]'' (literally 'blinded' or 'obscured'), a riddle which is solved 'by combining the constituent letters of the word or name to be found';&lt;ref&gt;G. J. H. van Gelder, 'mu‘ammā', in ''Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature'', ed. by Julie Scott Meisami and Paul Starkey, 2 vols (London: Routledge, 1998), II 534.&lt;/ref&gt; he was certainly a major exponent of the form.&lt;ref&gt;M. Bencheneb, 'Lu&lt;u&gt;gh&lt;/u&gt;z', in ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam'', new edn, ed. by H. A. R. Gibb and others (Leiden: Brill, 1954-2009), s.v.&lt;/ref&gt;

His freedom of expression, especially on matters forbidden by Islamic norms, continues to excite the animus of censors.{{Citation needed|date= January 2018}} While his works were freely in circulation until the early years of the twentieth century, in 1932 the first modern censored edition of his works appeared in Cairo. In January 2001, the [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|Egyptian Ministry of Culture]] ordered the burning of some 6,000 copies of books of [[homoerotic]] poetry by Abu Nuwas.&lt;ref&gt;''Al-Hayat'', January 13, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Middle East Report'', 219 Summer 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Any mention of pederasty was omitted from his entry in the Saudi ''[[Global Arabic Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;ref name="bearman"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Peri |last=Bearman |title=Global Arabic Encyclopedia |editor-first=Aptin |editor-last=Khanbaghi |year=2009 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedias about Muslim Civilisations |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, a crater on the planet Mercury was named in honor of Abu Nuwas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abu Nuwas (crater)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A heavily fictionalised Abu Nuwas is the protagonist of the novels ''The Father of Locks'' (Dedalus Books, 2009) and ''The Khalifah's Mirror'' (2012) by [[Andrew Killeen]], in which he is depicted as a spy working for [[Ja'far al-Barmaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dedalusbooks.com/our-books/reviews.php?id=00000204 |title=The Father of Locks by Andrew Killeen : Our Books :: Dedalus Books, Publishers of Literary Fiction |publisher=Dedalusbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Sudanese novel ''Season of Migration to the North'' (1966) by [[Tayeb Salih]], Abu Nuwas's love poetry is cited extensively by one of the novel's protagonists, the Sudanese Mustafa Sa'eed, as a means of seducing a young English woman in London: "Does it not please you that the earth is awaking,/ That old virgin wine is there for the taking?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/236338842|title=Season of migration to the north|last=al-Ṭayyib.|first=Ṣāliḥ,|last2=الطيب.|first2=صالح،|publisher=|others=Johnson-Davies, Denys., Lalami, Laila, 1968-|year=|isbn=9781590173022|edition=[Rev. ed.]|location=New York|pages=119-120.|oclc=236338842}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baghdad===
[[Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi]], the author of ''The History of Baghdad'', wrote that Abu Nuwas was buried in Shunizi cemetery in Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5DlbAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PA394&amp;ots=4twy8GhFuH&amp;dq=Abu%20Nuwas%20buried%20cemetery&amp;pg=PA394#v=onepage&amp;q=Abu%20Nuwas%20buried%20cemetery&amp;f=false |title=Ibn Khallikan's biographical dictionary - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has several places named for the poet. Abū Nuwās Street runs along the east bank of the [[Tigris]] that was once the city’s showpiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Britannica|2290|Abū Nuwās Street}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Nuwas Park is also located there on the 2.5-kilometer stretch between the Jumhouriya Bridge and a park that extends out to the river in Karada near the [[14th of July Bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvidshub.net/news/221/walk-park |title=DVIDS - News - A Walk in the Park |publisher=Dvidshub.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Swahili culture==
In East Africa's [[Swahili culture]] the name "Abu Nuwas" is quite popular as Abunuwasi.{{Citation needed|date= January 2018}} Here it is connected to a number of stories which otherwise go by names like [[Nasreddin]], Guha or "the Mullah" in folktale and literature of Islamic societies. In the tales Abunuwasi tricks greedy, wealthy men and avenges the poor people.{{Citation needed|date= January 2018}}

The [[Tanzania]]n artist Godfrey Mwampembwa ([[Gado (comics)|Gado]]) created a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] comic book called ''Abunuwasi'', which has adaptations of three of the Abunuwasi stories.&lt;ref name="Pilcher"&gt;Pilcher, Tim and Brad Brooks. (Foreword: Dave Gibbons). ''The Essential Guide to World Comics''. ''[[Collins and Brown]]''. 2005. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published by Sasa Sema Publications in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gado (Author) |url=https://www.amazon.com/Abunuwasi-Gado/dp/9966960902 |title=Abunuwasi (Swahili Edition) (9789966960900): Gado: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''All Media Network''' (formerly '''All Media Guide''' ('''AMG''') and '''AllRovi''') is an American [[company (law)|company]] that owns and maintains [[AllMusic]], [[AllMovie]], AllGame (until its closure in 2014), [[SideReel]] and Celebified. The company was founded in 1990 by [[pop culture|popular-culture]] archivist [[Michael Erlewine]]. All Media Network offices are located in [[San Francisco]], California, and [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], United States.

All Music Guide (now AllMusic) was launched in 1991. Later in 1994 the All Movie Guide (now AllMovie) was launched and in 1998 the All Game Guide (now AllGame).&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt;

== History ==
The company was founded in [[Big Rapids, Michigan]] in 1990 by Michael Erlewine. With the All Music Guide the aim was to "[compile] discographic information on every artist who's made a record since Enrico Caruso gave the industry its first big boost", which launched in 1991.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

They expanded with the All Movie Guide (now [[AllMovie]]) in 1994, and then the All Game Guide (now AllGame) in 1998.  moved to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] in 1999 to take advantage of the "rich talent pool".&lt;ref name="metro" /&gt; AMG was a business unit within [[Alliance Entertainment Corporation]] from 1996 until early 2005. Alliance was acquired in 1999 by [[Yucaipa Companies]], a multibillion-dollar fund based in California.

[[TiVo Corporation|Macrovision (now TiVo)]] announced on November 6, 2007 that it had agreed to purchase All Media Guide for a reported $102 million; $72 million in cash was paid up front, and $30 million in contingent payments were made one year later.&lt;ref name="BusinessWire" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandasoft" /&gt; For a time, all of the guides were controlled by Rovi's nameservers and combined access to the All Music and All Movie Guides was provided via AllRovi.com from 2011 until 2013. In 2013, Rovi sold consumer access of the content to the newly established All Media Network, LLC, but retained control of licensing the content to other businesses. The overall website is allmedianetwork.com (previously allmediaguide.com and allrovi.com).

Rovi sold the consumer access to them to newly established All Media Network, LLC in 2013, while retaining ownership and maintenance of the content itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rovicorp.com/company/press-releases/2013/7/31/rovicorp-reports-second-quarter-2013-financial-performance.html |title=Rovi Corporation Reports Second Quarter 2013 Financial Performance|date=July 31, 2013|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |accessdate=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://getsatisfaction.com/allmedianetwork/topics/whats_the_story_on_rovi |title=What's the Story on Rovi |last1=Zac |first1=Johnson |date=September 2013|accessdate=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AllGame section of the site was shut down on December 12, 2014.&lt;ref name="GameOver" /&gt;

'''''Baking With Julia''''' is an American television cooking program produced by [[Julia Child]] and the name of the book which accompanied the series. Each episode featured one pastry chef or baker who demonstrates professional techniques that can be performed in a home kitchen. It was taped primarily in Child's [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] house ([[Julia Child's kitchen]] was converted into a TV studio for the purpose) and was aired over four television seasons from 1996 to 1999; it is still occasionally aired in reruns on [[Create (TV channel)|Create]] on PBS digital stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CreateTV.com |url=http://www.createtv.com/CreateProgram.nsf/vProgramsByNola/BWJA |title=Baking with Julia |publisher=Create TV |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100926120428/http://www.createtv.com/CreateProgram.nsf/vProgramsbyNOLA/BWJA| archivedate= 26 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weta.org/tv/programsatoz/program/281 |title=Baking with Julia |publisher=WETA |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100724232420/http://www.weta.org/tv/programsatoz/program/281| archivedate= 24 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was created as a spinoff of the ''Cooking with Master Chefs'' series due to a significant response to the baking episodes and was a nation co-production of A La Carte Communications and [[Maryland Public Television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alacartetv.com/baking/baking.htm |title=Baking with Julia - Recipes |publisher=Alacartetv.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100817142227/http://www.alacartetv.com/baking/baking.htm| archivedate= 17 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The accompanying book was written by baker and food writer [[Dorie Greenspan]] with assistance from Child and food tester [[David Nussbaum]], and includes brief biographical sketches of the chefs involved in the show.

Among the prominent bakers and pastry chefs featured were: 
* [[Alice Medrich]] (Episode 102)

'''''Barber v Somerset CC''''' [2004] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2004/13.html UKHL 13] is a [[UK labour law]] case, concerning [[wrongful dismissal]].

==Facts==
Heard along with the ''Hatton'' case, Mr Barber was a maths teacher at East Bridgwater Community School (previously Sydenham Comprehensive School) who had to take on more work given funding cuts, and was working between 61 and 70 hours a week. He was head of department but then had to become the ‘Mathematical Area of Experience Co-ordinator’. He took off three weeks, and returned. The employer was unsympathetic. His work worsened and then Mr Barber had a mental collapse in November 1996, and took early retirement at 52 in March 1997.

First Instance awarded £101,000 in general and special damages.

==Judgment==
Lord Hope and Lord Rodger gave short opinions. Lord Walker held that Mr Barber should receive £72,547 for the employer’s breach of duty by failing to take steps to ensure his health was sound following his three-week break. The school managers should have reassessed Mr Barber’s workload for the sake of his health.

Lord Bingham, Lord Steyn concurred with Lord Walker.

A '''bearer instrument''' is a document that entitles the holder of the document rights of ownership or  [[title (property)|title]] to the underlying [[property]], such as [[share (finance)|share]]s or [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]. Unlike normal [[registered instrument]]s, no record is kept of who owns bearer instruments or of transactions involving transfer of ownership, enabling the owner to deal with the property anonymously. Whoever physically holds the bearer document is assumed to be the owner of the property, and the rights arising therefrom, such as dividends. 

Bearer instruments are used especially by investors and corporate officers who wish to retain anonymity. The [[OECD]] in a 2003 report concluded that the use of bearer shares is "perhaps the single most important (and perhaps the most widely used) mechanism" to protect the anonymity of a ship's beneficial owner.&lt;ref name="oecd8"&gt;OECD 2003, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Physically possessing a bearer share accords ownership of the corporation, which in turn owns the asset.&lt;ref name="oecd8"/&gt; There is no requirement for reporting the transfer of bearer shares, and not every jurisdiction requires that their serial numbers even be recorded.&lt;ref name="oecd8"/&gt;

However, ownership (or legal entitlement) is extremely difficult to establish in event of loss or [[theft]]. In general, the legal ''[[Situs (law)|situs]]'' of the property is where the instrument is located. Bearer instruments can be used in certain jurisdictions to avoid [[transfer tax]]es, although taxes may be charged when bearer instruments are issued.

In the United States, under the [[Uniform Commercial Code]], a [[negotiable instrument]] (such as a [[cheque|check]] or [[promissory note]]) that is payable to the order of "bearer" or "cash" may be enforced (i.e. redeemed for payment) by the party in possession. The payee (i.e. the person named in the "pay to" line) may also convert an instrument into a bearer instrument by endorsing (signing) the back. In practice, however, many merchants and financial institutions will not pay a check presented for payment by anyone other than the named payee.

== History ==


The first bearer securities in almost all countries were banknotes. Later, due to the monopolization of banknote issue by one or several banks (usually government ones), the form of bearer securities began to accept short-term bank loan obligations (certificates, vouchers, tickets) and long-term borrowing obligations of banks and corporations (bonds). With the development of the joint-stock form of enterprises in the form of bearer securities, shares were also issued. Historically, the first appeared registered shares, and much later there were shares of the bearer. Their appearance was associated with the development of the stock exchange. 

The emergence of the first joint-stock companies can be attributed to the beginning of the 17th century: the famous English East India Company in 1613 and the Dutch East India Company in 1602. The shares of these companies were originally registered. The first bearer shares appeared with the establishment of John Law in France in 1717. By royal decree John Law was granted the right to establish a joint-stock bank with a fixed capital of 6 million francs, divided into 1,200 shares of 5,000 francs each with the right to issue banknotes. In August 1717, Law established a new joint stock company, Mississippi, with a fixed capital of 100 million, divided into 200,000 shares to colonize the countries lying along the banks of the Mississippi River. Shares of the bank, and of the company were bearer.

Facilities associated with the bearer form of shares (ease of transfer, circulation on the exchange, proof of ownership) were evaluated and widely applied in joint-stock companies. But along with these advantages, the drawbacks of using these securities have also come to light: for example, their use in the exchange game. In the joint-stock establishments of John Law, these disadvantages of bearer shares were discovered quite soon. The stock market fever gripped a huge number of people, and after a while it ended in failure: the owners of shares, who for a few days considered themselves big capitalists, were left with nothing, holding worthless papers in their hands.

Despite the first unfortunate experience, this form of participation in the joint-stock company as the acquisition of certificates of bearer shares has become quite widespread in Europe. Today there is an opinion that bearer shares are some kind of invention of offshore financial centers for the purpose of hiding information about the real owner of the company. However, this tool with more or less success has been functioning for more than one century.

== Bearer shares ==


'''Bearer shares''' are called securities, an anonymous holder of which is recognized from the legal point of view as a full-fledged shareholder of the company with all relevant rights. This document does not contain any indication of the name and name of the owner. The rights certified by the bearer act are actually owned by the owner of this document. The owner of the bearer certificate is considered the owner of shares certified by a certificate. Neither the company nor the chairman of the meeting of shareholders entered in the company's register, nor the director, any official of the company and no other authorized person is required to find out the circumstances under which the certificate was placed by its owner, or to raise the question of the validity or eligibility of any company, any actions of the owner of the certificate of such action. A shareholder is a person who actually owns a share (a share certificate). Bearer shares are transferred by simply delivering the certificate to a new holder. When the bearer shares are sold, it is not required to make any transfer inscriptions on the share certificate: the share is transferred by the physical transfer of the certificate from the seller (the bearer of the share certificate) to the buyer. The transfer of the bearer shares means the transfer of the relevant rights to the company. In contrast, a registered share contains an indication of the identity of the shareholder - only this person, and no one else can be a shareholder of the company. The names of the owners are entered in the register of the company's shareholders (owners of bearer shares are not registered in the company's register), and any transfer of shares from one owner to another is carried out on the basis of a written document (for example, a contract of sale between the seller and the buyer).Information on the change of owners of registered shares is also reflected in the shareholder register.

=== Issue of bearer shares ===


The first and most important condition for the issue of bearer shares is the fact that this right should be provided by the legislation of the country of registration for this type of company. In addition, the right to issue certificates of shares to bearer must be fixed in the company's constituent documents. The decision to issue shares in offshore jurisdictions is taken by the company's director. And at the same time the share certificate is issued.

A share certificate is the main document certifying the rights of the shareholder, in which the statutory information is mandatory: name of the issuer, certificate number, the amount of the capital, number of shares owned by the holder of this certificate, date of issue of the certificate. In the column where the owner of the action is to be indicated, the name "bearer" is given in place of the name. This means that the actual owner of this certificate is the person who has this certificate. The company's constituent documents, as a rule, provide for the procedure for signing a certificate. In most offshore jurisdictions, share certificates must be signed by the director or other authorized person of the company.

=== World trends in legislation ===

Until recently, there was no mechanism to control the movement of bearer shares. Registered agents, sending their agent company's constituent documents, together with the certificate of registration, the charter and the memorandum of association, passed, as a rule, the forms of certificates of shares. Questions about who owns these certificates, and how they are transferred, were not asked. 

However, in the past few years, economically developed countries, in particular the United States, as well as international organizations such as OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) and the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) have begun to put significant pressure on offshore jurisdiction. Their main claim was not even that there is preferential taxation in low-tax areas, but lack of transparency: there are no open registries, no indication of who really owns the companies. And although international organizations have no right to issue binding instructions, and can not apply sanctions, nevertheless, some offshore jurisdictions have begun to improve their legislation in accordance with the recommendations of such international organisations. The FATF reflected its main directions of the prevention of money laundering in the document "40 Recommendations". Recommendations were adopted in April 1990 and almost every year undergo some changes. Recommendations of the FATF establish measures to ensure the transparency of legal entities with a view to obtaining competent authorities access to information about the beneficial owner at any time. Changes in the legislation of offshore jurisdictions within the framework of these recommendations are most often related to the open register of shareholders and directors, cancellation of bearer shares, as well as information cooperation with management and control bodies. Offshore centers reacted to criticism of their use of bearer shares in different ways. In a number of low-tax jurisdictions, bearer shares were banned (Bahamas, Isle of Man, Jersey, Mauritius). Now companies are registered there, but in a much smaller number than in other offshore territories. Some jurisdictions have taken compromise measures: on the one hand they tried to comply with the requirements of international organizations, and on the other hand - the requirements of customers who register and use companies (British Virgin Islands and Belize). And some countries, formally agreeing to cooperate, nevertheless, did not make significant changes to their legislation (Seychelles).

=== Advantages and disadvantages of bearer shares ===

The main advantage for which registered companies with bearer shares earlier is confidentiality. Since at present information on holders of certificates of bearer shares is often needed to disclose even to one person, confidentiality can be called imaginary. Another advantage - the simplicity of transferring certificates of shares to the bearer is now also becoming more likely to become a drawback, namely, the insecurity of the owner from theft or loss. Any person who has acquired a certificate of bearer shares will be considered the owner of this certificate. The next drawback is the difficulty in opening a bank account. Some banks refuse to open accounts for companies that issued bearer shares, despite the fact that the client is ready to disclose all information about the owners of such shares, believing that this is contrary to their "know your client" policy. Some banks ask to deposit certificates of bearer shares with them. In addition, there may be difficulties in notifying shareholders about holding an annual meeting. As a rule, the procedure should be prescribed in the constituent documents. If a shareholder does not physically reside in this state, then it is likely that he simply will not find out about this fact. There can be a situation when the company wants to open an office in any country, and according to the legislation of this country it is necessary to confirm the fact of ownership of this company by the shareholder. A shareholder with certificates of bearer shares will not be able to confirm his rights, as his name is not indicated in the certificates.

'''Boysie Oakes''' is fictional [[secret agent]] created by the British spy novelist [[John Gardner (British writer)|John Gardner]] in 1964 at the height of a period of fictional spy mania. 

==Character Biography==
Oakes is a richly comic character who is inadvertently taken to be a tough, pitiless man of action and is recruited into a British spy agency. He is, in actuality, a devout coward with many other character flaws who wants nothing more than to be left alone.

An example of the endearing points in these novels is the continuing appearance of monogrammed "BO" gifts from his mother - shirts, handkerchiefs, cigarette lighter, and so forth. He would never dream of '''not''' using them, even though he resents them.
 
The cowardly Oakes starred in another seven novels over the next 15 years and eventually, once again by inadvertence, becomes the head of the secret agency that has caused him to be in a constant state of terror for so long. 

==Film==
The first novel in the series, ''[[The Liquidator (novel)|The Liquidator]]'', was made into a [[The Liquidator (1965 film)|feature film of the same name]] in 1965, starring [[Rod Taylor (actor)|Rod Taylor]] as Boysie Oakes.

'''''Chronica Polonorum''''' ({{lang-la|Chronicle of the Poles}}, {{lang-pl|Kronika polska}}) by [[Maciej Miechowita]] is a treaty about Polish history and geography written in [[Latin]] by a [[Polish renaissance]] scholar, professor of [[Jagiellonian University]], historian, geographer, royal physician of king [[Zygmunt I the Old]] and [[astrologer]], Maciej of [[Miechów]]. ''Chronica Polonorum'' was first published in 1519.&lt;ref&gt;Włodzimierz Hubicki, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090710104718/http://www.uj.edu.pl/dispatch.jsp?item=uniwersytet%2Fhistoria%2Fhistoriatxt.jsp&amp;lang=en "Fuitne olim alchimia in Academia Cracoviensi lecta?"] ''Kwartalnik historii nauki i techniki'' 9 (1964): 199–210.

==Content==
The Chronicle describes the history of Poland. It is based on the earlier work of [[Jan Długosz]], supplementing its content with the events leading to the accession of [[Sigismund the Old]] to the throne. Although the first edition of the Chronicle was published in 1519, it was confiscated by the authorities.&lt;ref name="RF"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford History of Poland-Lithuania: The making of the Polish-Lithuanian union, 1385-1569 |author=Robert I.

The book was republished in 1521 without the offending passages about [[Jagiellons]] and the Primate [[Jan Łaski]]. The Chronicle by Miechowita became a seminal source of data used in the creation of further chronicles by [[Bernard Wapowski]] and [[Marcin Kromer]], the author of ''De origine et rebus GESTIS Polonorum''. Miechowita had his ''Chronica Polonorum'' republished by printer Hieronim Wietor of [[Kraków]]. A supplementary treaty in three volumes written by Ludwik Decjusz (Louis Decius) was added to it as ''De vetustatibus Polonorum'' liber I, ''De Iagellonum familia'' liber II, and ''De Sigismundi regis temporibus'' liber III.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?id=1994 ''Chronica Polonorum] Wielkopolska Biblioteka Cyfrowa&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''collaborative practice agreement''' ('''CPA''') is a [[legal document]] in the United States that establishes a legal relationship between [[pharmacists]] and collaborating [[physicians]] that allows for pharmacists to participate in collaborative drug therapy management (CDTM).

CDTM is an expansion of the traditional pharmacist [[scope of practice]], allowing for pharmacist-led management of drug related problems (DRPs) with an emphasis on a [[collaborative]], [[interdisciplinary]] approach to pharmacy practice in the healthcare setting. The terms of a CPA are decided by the collaborating pharmacist and physician, though templates exist online. CPAs can be specific to a patient population of interest to the two parties, a specific clinical situation or disease state, and/or may outline an evidence-based protocol for managing the drug regimen of patients under the CPA. CPAs have become the subject of intense debate within the pharmacy and medical professions.

A collaborative practice agreement can be referred to as a consult agreement, physician-pharmacist agreement, standing order or protocol, or physician delegation.

==History==
According to healthcare researcher Karen E. Koch, the first coining of the term "collaborative drug therapy management" can be traced back to [[William A. Zellmer|William A. Zellmer's]] 1995 publication in the ''[[American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy]]''.&lt;ref name="CDTM Koch Article" /&gt; Zellmer advocates use of the term "collaborative drug therapy management" instead of "prescribing," arguing that it will make legislation that expands the authority of pharmacists more palatable to lawmakers (and physician stakeholders). Most importantly, it centers the discussion on ''why'' pharmacists are interested in expanding that authority: to improve patient care through interdisciplinary collaboration.&lt;ref name="Zellmer CDTM in AJHSP"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zellmer|first1=William A.|date=August 1, 1995|title=Collaborative Drug Therapy Management|url=|journal=[[American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy]]|volume=52|page=1732|pages=|accessdate=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern concept of ''collaborative'' practice was derived, in part, to avoid the controversial term of dependent ''prescribing'' authority.&lt;ref name="CDTM Koch Article" /&gt;

The term "collaborative practice agreement" has also been referred to as a consult agreement, collaborative pharmacy practice agreement, physician-pharmacist agreement, standing order or standing protocol, and physician delegation.&lt;ref name="APhA CPA Policy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmacist.com/policy-101-collaborative-practice-empowers-pharmacists-practice-providers|title=Policy 101: Collaborative practice empowers pharmacists to practice as providers|last1=Weaver|first1=Krystalyn|date=|website=pharmacist.com|publisher=[[American Pharmacists Association]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collaborative practice agreement is a [[legal document]] in the United States that establishes a formal relationship between [[pharmacists]] (often [[clinical pharmacy]] specialists) and collaborating [[physicians]] for the purpose of establishing a legal and ethical basis for pharmacists to participate in collaborative drug therapy management.&lt;ref name="ECP"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Clinical Pharmacy|last1=Carmichael|first1=Jannet|date=2003|publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]]|isbn=0-8247-0752-4|location=New York, NY|pages=199–206|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDTM Koch Article"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koch|first1=Karen|title=Trends in Collaborative Drug Therapy Management|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/409878_1|website=Medscape.com|publisher=WebMD LLC|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal guidance and requirements for the formation of CPAs are established on a state by state basis.&lt;ref name="ECP" /&gt; The [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] approved CPAs in 1995.&lt;ref name="CDTM ACCP '03 Paper"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammond|first1=RW|last2=Schwartz|first2=AH|last3=Campbell|first3=MJ|last4=Remington|first4=TL|last5=Chuck|first5=S|last6=Blair|first6=MM|last7=Vassey|first7=AM|last8=Rospond|first8=RM|last9=Herner|first9=SJ|date=2003|title=Collaborative Drug Therapy Management by Pharmacists—2003|url=https://www.accp.com/docs/positions/positionStatements/pos2309.pdf|journal=[[American College of Clinical Pharmacy]]|volume=23|issue=9|pages=1210–1225|via=|last10=Webb|first10=CE}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Washington (state)|Washington]] was the first state to pass legislation allowing for the formal formation of CPAs.

==Effect on outcomes==
CPAs have been implemented for the management of a plethora of chronic disease states, including [[diabetes mellitus]], [[asthma]], and [[hypertension]]. Evidence suggests that CPAs have resulted in beneficial health outcomes for patients involved. It has been shown that pharmacists working with providers under CPAs help deliver higher quality of care in the [[oncology]] setting, including the management of [[antiemetic]] (anti-vomiting) therapy. Within these settings, CPAs have resulted in improved attainment of goal laboratory values like [[hemoglobin A1c]] for diabetics, improved lung function for asthmatics, and improved blood pressure control for people with hypertension.&lt;ref name="Merten et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merten|first1=Julianna A.|last2=Shapiro|first2=Jamie F.|last3=Gulbis|first3=Alison M.|last4=Rao|first4=Kamakshi V.|last5=Bubalo|first5=Joseph|last6=Lanum|first6=Scott|last7=Engemann|first7=Ashley Morris|last8=Shayani|first8=Sepideh|last9=Williams|first9=Casey|date=April 2013|title=Utilization of Collaborative Practice Agreements between Physicians and Pharmacists as a Mechanism to Increase Capacity to Care for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3694445/#!po=2.63158|journal=Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation|volume=19|issue=4|pages=509–518|doi=10.1016/j.bbmt.2012.12.022|accessdate=13 October 2017|last10=Leather|first10=Helen|last11=Walsh-Chocolaad|first11=Tracey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CPAs can be used as tools for pharmacists to better integrate with practicing clinicians in accountable care organization (ACO) offices, alleviate the time constraints of primary care visits, and help minimize delays in managing patients' chronic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pharmacytimes.com/news/pharmacists-in-acos-part-3-chronic-care-management-chronic-disease-state-management-and-transition-of-care|title=Pharmacists in ACOs part 3: Chronic care management, chronic disease state management, and transition of care|last=Joseph, T., Hale. G., Gernant., S., et al.|first=|date=2016|website=Pharmacy Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Nov 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacy services==
Pharmacists involved in CPAs may participate in clinical services that are outside of the traditional scope of practice for pharmacists. Notably, pharmacists do not need to participate in CPAs to provide many pharmacy practice services that are already covered by their traditional scope of practice, such as performing medication therapy management, providing disease prevention services (e.g. immunizations), engaging in public health screenings (e.g. screening patients for depressive disorders, such as [[major depressive disorder]], via administering the [[PHQ-9#Related Instruments|PHQ-2]]), providing disease-state specific education (e.g. as a [[certified diabetes educator]]), and counseling patients on information regarding their medications.&lt;ref name="APhA-F CPA Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aphafoundation.org/collaborative-practice-agreements|title=Collaborative Practice Agreements (CPA) and Pharmacists' Patient Care Services|last=|first=|date=|website=aphafoundation.org|publisher=[[American Pharmacists Association]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expanded pharmacy services under a CPA are described as collaborative drug therapy management (CDTM).{{efn|CDTM is sometimes also referred to as clinical pharmacy services, pharmaceutical care, disease state management, or comprehensive medication management.&lt;ref name="Kim Jun Review on CDTM in AmCare"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim Jun|first1=Jeany|title=The Role of Pharmacy Through Collaborative Practice in an Ambulatory Care Clinic|journal=American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine|date=2017|doi=10.1177/1559827617691721}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  While the traditional scope of practice for pharmacists provides for the legal authority to detect drug related problems (DRPs) and provide ''suggestions'' for solving DRPs to [[Medical prescription#Who can write prescriptions (that may legally be filled with prescription-only items)|prescribers]] (such as physicians), pharmacists that provide CDTM ''directly'' solve DRPs when they detect them. This may involve prescribing activities, which include selecting and initiating medications for the treatment of a patient's diagnosed illnesses (as outlined in the CPA), discontinuing the use of prescription or [[over-the-counter]] medications, modifying a patient's drug therapy (e.g. changing the strength, frequency, route of drug administration, or duration of therapy), evaluating a patient's response to drug therapy (which may include ordering and performing [[laboratory test]]s, such as a [[basic metabolic panel]]), and continuing drug therapy (providing a new prescription).&lt;ref name="ECP" /&gt;

Other services may include administering medications, especially those administered [[wikt:parenteral|parenterally]] (e.g. long-acting, injectable [[antipsychotics]]).&lt;ref name="CDTM Koch Article" /&gt;

==Variation by state==
The legal provisions of CPAs vary on a state-by-state basis. This affects the specific services that pharmacists are allowed to perform pursuant to a CPA, as well as the terms of the arrangement (e.g. requirements for CPA renewal). Wisconsin's "Wisconsin Act 294," for example, has been described by the [[American Pharmacists Association]] (APhA) as granting some of the most expansive powers to pharmacists in any state CPA law.&lt;ref name="APhA CPA Policy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="APhA Wisconsin CPA Law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmacist.com/wisconsin-provider-status-law-backed-state-medical-society|title=Wisconsin provider status law backed by state medical society|last1=Yap|first1=Diana|date=29 April 2014|website=pharmacist.com|publisher=[[American Pharmacists Association]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alaskan CPAs may involve multiple pharmacists and multiple practitioners (e.g. one pharmacist entering into a CPA with a group of staff physicians, multiple pharmacists entering into a CPA with one physician, or multiple pharmacists entering into a CPA with multiple pharmacists), though a "principal prescribing practitioner" must be named. The CPA must specify the disease states, medications (or medication classes) that the pharmacists are allowed to make decisions on, as well as a procedure/protocol in place for making those decisions. Decisions must be reviewed at least every 3 months together with the covered entities, and the protocols are only effective for a maximum of 2 years at a time.&lt;ref name="AKPhA CPA Application"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alaskapharmacy.org/files/Legislative/BOP-%20Pharmacist%20Collaborative%20Practice%20Application.pdf|title=Pharmacist Collaborative Practice Application|last=|first=|date=2006|website=alaskapharmacy.org|publisher=Alaska Pharmacists Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208202102/http://alaskapharmacy.org/files/Legislative/BOP-%20Pharmacist%20Collaborative%20Practice%20Application.pdf|archive-date=8 February 2017|dead-url=yes|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alaskan CPAs allow pharmacists to "monitor drug therapy" pursuant to 12 AAC 52.995, which includes conducting a full patient history, measuring vital signs, and ordering/evaluating CPA covered laboratory tests.&lt;ref name="AKPhA CPA Application" /&gt;&lt;ref name="12 AAC 52.995"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/aac.asp#12.52.995|title=Alaska Admin Code 12 AAC 52.995|last=|first=|date=|website=www.legis.state.ak.us|publisher=[[Alaska Legislature]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arizonan CPAs apply to individual pharmacists and practitioners, referred to as "providers" in the law. Providers include physicians or registered nurse practitioners. The CPA must specify the disease states, medications, conditions for notifying the provider, and the laboratory tests that the pharmacist can order. Pharmacists may monitor or modify a patient's drug treatment in accordance with the CPA, provided that the provider and pharmacist have a mutual patient-practitioner relationship with the patient.&lt;ref name="AZ CPA Law in ARS and AC" /&gt;

Arkansan CPAs apply to individual pharmacists, practitioners, specified as "practitioners authorized to prescribe drugs," and patients. The specific disease states that the pharmacists will manage, along with the specified drugs the pharmacist may use, are required. Pharmacists are required to document their interventions for discussion with the collaborative practitioner, and must retain such records for at least 2 years after the date the record is made.&lt;ref name="AR Laws for CPAs" /&gt;

To engage in CPAs, pharmacists must be able to assess the health status of their patients, implement a pharmaceutical care plan, communicate with stakeholders, and monitor the patient's progress. This includes being able to determine when to intervene in a patient's drug therapy.&lt;ref name="AR Laws for CPAs" /&gt; Pharmacists may receive credentials from organizations that the Board of Pharmacy approves.&lt;ref name="AR Laws for CPAs" /&gt;

Under the PPAC, certified Pharmacist Clinician is permitted to register for a personal [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) number. Their scope of practice is mainly [[drug therapy]] related [[general medicine]]. Currently they have prescriptive authority for these three types of disease states: [[hypercholesterolemia]], [[diabetes]], and [[hypertension]] within the specific disease management protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nmpharmacy.org/Resources/Documents/PhC/Pharmacist_Clinician_Practice_Guidelines_template-1-.pdf|title=Pharmacist Clinician Practice Guidelines Prescriptive Authority Protocol|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacist advocacy==
CPAs are a focus of advocacy efforts for professional pharmacy organizations. In January 2012, the [[American Pharmacists Association]] (APhA) convened a consortium composed of pharmacy, medicine, and nursing stakeholders representing 12 states to discuss the integration of CPAs into everyday clinical practice.&lt;ref name="APhA Consortium 2012"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheffer|first1=Joe|title=Collaborative practice agreements: Stimulating increased integration|url=http://www.pharmacist.com/collaborative-practice-agreements-stimulating-increased-integration|website=pharmacist.com|publisher=American Pharmacists Association|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consortium published a [[white paper]] titled "Consortium Recommendations for Advancing Pharmacists' Patient Care Services and Collaborative Practice Agreements," summarizing their recommendations.&lt;ref name="APhA-F CPA Guide" /&gt;

In July 2015, the [[National Alliance of State Pharmacy Associations]] (NASPA) convened a working group composed of appointees from the [[CEO]]s of [[Joint Commission of Pharmacy Practitioners]] (JCPP) member organizations, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, and individual states.&lt;ref name="NASPA 2017 WG Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naspa.us/resource/cpa-report/|title=Pharmacist Collaborative Practice Agreements: Key Elements for Legislative and Regulatory Authority|last=|first=|date=July 2015|website=|publisher=The National Alliance of State Pharmacy Associations|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18 member working group's report made recommendations towards what state lawmakers should include in CPA laws.&lt;ref name="NASPA 2017 WG Report" /&gt;&lt;ref name="APhA on NASPA WG Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmacist.com/collaborative-practice-agreements-naspa-workgroup-releases-recommendations|title=Collaborative practice agreements: NASPA workgroup releases recommendations|last1=Collins|first1=Sonya|date=1 September 2015|website=pharmacist.com|publisher=[[American Pharmacists Association]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[American College of Clinical Pharmacy]] (ACCP) published an updated white paper on the subject of collaborative drug therapy management. The ACCP periodically publishes updates on the subject, with previous publications in 2003 and 1997. The paper describes the recent history of CPAs, the legislative progress, and discusses payment models for collaborative drug therapy management activities.&lt;ref name="ACCP White Paper on CDTM" /&gt;

==Physician perspective==
CPAs have been met with mixed reviews by physicians and physician advocacy groups.

===Praise===
In a 2011 commentary for the [[American College of Clinical Pharmacy]] (ACCP), healthcare policy consultant and physician Terry McInnis stressed the need for pharmacist–physician collaboration to improve positive patient outcomes and to decrease healthcare costs. In the final paragraph, she makes an appeal towards pharmacists interested in pursuing CPAs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For pharmacists, I believe that you have come to one of the rare crossroads that will define the future of your profession. You will either take your place as providers of care, or your numbers will dwindle as most dispensing activities are replaced by robotics and pharmacy technicians. I am a physician, and I say our profession and the patients that we serve need you 'on the team' as clinical pharmacist practitioners. But, will you truly join us?&lt;ref name="McInnis MD Article"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McInnis|first1=Terry|date=October 2011|title=The Most Transformative Force in Health Care or the Demise of a Profession?|url=https://www.accp.com/report/index.aspx?iss=1011&amp;art=5|journal=[[American College of Clinical Pharmacy]]|volume=|pages=|accessdate=9 May 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the keynote address of the 2013 APhA annual meeting, Reid Blackwelder, President of the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] (AAFP),&lt;ref name="AAFP Dr Blackwelder Pres"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aafp.org/media-center/releases-statements/all/2013/Blackwelder-President.html|title=Reid B.

===Criticism===
In 2012, the AAFP produced a position paper that expressed support for CPAs,&lt;ref name="AAFP 2017 Position Paper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aafp.org/about/policies/all/pharmacists.html|title=Pharmacists (Position Paper)|last=|first=|date=|website=aafp.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Family Physicians]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but stressed the risk of fragmenting care if pharmacists were given fully autonomous prescribing privileges.&lt;ref name="CPNP Position Statement"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstone|first1=Lisa|last2=DiPaula|first2=Bethany|last3=Caballero|first3=Joshua|last4=Park|first4=Susie|last5=Price|first5=Cristofer|last6=Slater|first6=Magdalena|date=January 2015|title=Improving medication-related outcomes for patients with psychiatric and neurologic disorders: Value of psychiatric pharmacists as part of the health care team|url=http://mhc.cpnp.org/doi/full/10.9740/mhc.2015.01.001?code=cpnp-site|journal=[[College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists]]|volume=5|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.9740/mhc.2015.01.001|accessdate=29 April 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) published a series of reports called the "AMA Scope of Practice Data Series."&lt;ref name="MH News on AMA Reports"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20100405/MAGAZINE/100409984|title=Primary dispute|last1=Carlson|first1=Joe|date=April 5, 2010|work=|accessdate=9 May 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|agency=Modern Healthcare}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reports was focused on the profession of pharmacy, which criticized the formation of CPAs as an attempt to encroach upon the physician's scope of practice by pharmacists. In response to the report, a collaboration of seven national professional pharmacy associations drafted a response to the AMA's report on pharmacists.&lt;ref name="NABP Response to AMA News"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nabp.pharmacy/seven-pharmacy-organizations-respond-to-ama-scope-of-pharmacy-practice-document/|title=Seven Pharmacy Organizations Respond to AMA Scope of Pharmacy Practice Document|last=|first=|date=5 May 2010|website=|publisher=[[National Association of Boards of Pharmacy]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The response urged the AMA to correct their report, and to publish the revised report with [[errata]].&lt;ref name="Joint Letter to AMA 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maves|first1=Michael D.|title=Re: American Medical Association (AMA) Scope of Practice Data Series: Pharmacists|url=http://www.accp.com/docs/positions/commentaries/AMA%20Scope%20of%20Practice%20Response%20Letter%20Final%20Joint%20Pharmacy%20Organization%20Letter.pdf|website=accp.com|publisher=American College of Clinical Pharmacy|accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the House of Delegates of the AMA adopted a softer tone by APhA in response to input from it and other professional pharmacy associations, ultimately passing the following resolution that refocused attention on opposing ''independent'' (rather than collaborative, or ''dependent'') practice agreements:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That our AMA develop model state legislation to address the expansion of pharmacist scope of practice that is found to be inappropriate or constitutes the practice of medicine, including but not limited to the issue of interpretations or usage of independent practice arrangements without appropriate physician supervision and work with interested states and specialties to advance such legislation (Directive to Take Action).&lt;ref name="APhA Response to AMA HoD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmacist.com/ama-evaluate-%E2%80%9Cexpanding-scope-pharmacists%E2%80%99-practice%E2%80%9D|title=AMA to evaluate "expanding scope of pharmacists' practice"|last=Posey|first=L.

'''Credo Reference''' or '''Credo''' (formerly '''Xrefer''') is an [[United States|American]] [[company]] that offers online reference content by [[subscription]] and partners with libraries to develop information-literacy programs or produce library marketing plans and materials.&lt;ref name=LiteratiReview&gt;Swoger, Bonnie.

Accessed: 2014-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Founded in 1999, Credo Reference provides full-text online versions of over 3,500 published reference works from more than 100 publishers in a variety of major subjects.&lt;ref name=SweetRise&gt;Brynko, Barbara.

(Archived by WebCite at https://www.webcitation.org/5zTYWk1pT?url=http://www.infotoday.com/IT/may11/Sweet-The-Rise-of-Credo-Reference.shtml )&lt;/ref&gt;  These include general and subject dictionaries as well as encyclopedias.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Reference sources for small and medium-sized libraries |page=11 |author=Jack O'Gorman |year=2008 |edition=7th |isbn=978-0-8389-0943-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's customers are libraries, library systems, k-12 schools, and universities, which subscribe to the service for their patrons' use.&lt;ref name=LiteratiByCredo&gt;Sheret, L.

In 2010, a review of general reference sources by Library Journal focused on Credo Reference and three similar services.&lt;ref name=eReviews&gt;Golderman, Gail; Connolly, Bruce. [http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/ljinprintcurrentissue/886908-403/ereviews_general_reference_sources_and.html.csp eReviews: General Reference Sources and Short Takes]. LibraryJournal.com. 2011-06-15. Accessed: 2011-06-15.

== History ==
The company was founded as '''Xrefer''' in 1999. Xrefer initially provided free access to several dozen reference works.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000817011558/http://w2.xrefer.com/search.jsp Xrefer's front page] as of August 17, 2000, via archive.org.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, [[Béla Hatvany]], founder of Computer Library Services (CLSI) and [[Silverplatter]], invested in Xrefer and funded the company’s transition to becoming an online reference database product for libraries.&lt;ref name=SweetRise /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, J. (2009). Reference tool helps organise scholarly resources. Research Information. April/May 2009. http://www.researchinformation.info/features/feature.php?feature_id=215&lt;/ref&gt; The company established an office in [[Boston]], MA  USA, which would later become its headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;Witte, S., &amp; Cargill, M. (2008). Selected Reference Works, 2007–081. College &amp; Research Libraries, 69(5), 459-475. http://crl.acrl.org/content/69/5/459.short&lt;/ref&gt; The name Credo Reference was adopted in June 2007; the company also moved its [[England]] office from [[London]] to [[Oxford]] in that year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16085">A '''Doe subpoena''' is a [[subpoena]] that seeks the identity of an unknown [[defendant]] to a [[lawsuit]].  Most jurisdictions permit a [[plaintiff]] who does not yet know a defendant's identity to file suit against [[John Doe]] and then use the tools of the [[discovery (law)|discovery]] process to seek the defendant's true name.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron E. Kornblum, [http://www.ceas.cc/papers-2005/174.pdf ''Searching For John Doe: Finding Spammers and Phishers'' (pdf)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412124823/http://www.ceas.cc/papers-2005/174.pdf |date=April 12, 2007 }}, Second Conference on Email and Anti-Spam (2005).  Retrieved on 2009-03-15. &lt;/ref&gt;  A Doe subpoena is often served on an [[online service provider]] or [[ISP]] for the purpose of identifying the author of an [[anonymous post]].  

==Legal process==
Unmasking an anonymous online poster is a two-step process.  First, the plaintiff must issue a subpoena to the [[web hosting service|hosting website]] requesting the [[IP address]] of the poster.  Most websites collect and temporarily store the IP addresses of visitors in a web [[server log]], although no U.S. law requires that they retain this information for any particular length of time.&lt;ref&gt;Bills proposed in both houses of [[United States Congress|Congress]] in February 2009 would require ISPs and [[wireless access point]]s to retain records of IP addresses for two years.  This proposal, if enacted, would not affect the retention policies of web hosting services, however.  ''See'' {{cite news | last = Albanesius | first = Chloe | title = Bill Would Require ISPs to Retain Data for Two Years | publisher = PCMag | date = 2009-02-20  | url = https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2341476,00.asp | accessdate = 2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the website provides the poster's IP address, the plaintiff must then subpoena the [[ISP]] that owns the address.  This second subpoena requests the contact information associated with the account of the computer to which the IP address was assigned at the time the post was made.

Courts do not require the target of a subpoena to provide [[notice]] to the person whose identity is sought.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 346.&lt;/ref&gt;  The hosting website is unlikely to notify the defendant, as it generally will not have access to contact information; subpoenas for IP addresses are therefore seldom subjected to legal challenge.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 328.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ISP, however, may be required by law to notify its subscriber before revealing any [[personally identifiable information]] in connection with a subpoena.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [[#Statutory Limitations to Obtaining IP Addresses|Statutory Limitations to Obtaining IP Addresses]].&lt;/ref&gt;  

A defendant who does receive notice may file a motion to quash, which asks the court to block the subpoena and prevent the ISP from complying.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' [http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/potential-legal-challenges-anonymity Citizen Media Law Project's Guide to Potential Legal Challenges to Anonymity]. Retrieved on 2009-03-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  ISPs may also challenge Doe subpoenas on their customers' behalf, but they are not required to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Gleicher, ''supra'' note 1, at 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal standards==
No uniform standard exists in the United States for determining the circumstances under which an anonymous online speaker may be unmasked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1365326 Who's Exposing John Doe] Journal of Technology Law &amp; Policy, Vol. 13, No. 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The federal and state courts that have considered the issue have applied a variety of tests.  

===Summary judgment standard===
This standard requires an ISP to divulge the identity of an anonymous poster if the plaintiff's case would be able to withstand a motion for [[summary judgment]].  This means that the plaintiff must "make a sufficient showing on [every] essential element of its case with respect to which it has the burden of proof."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Celotex Corp. v. Catrett]]'', [http://supreme.justia.com/us/477/317/case.html 477 U.S. 317, 323] (1986). Retrieved on 2009-03-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lead case applying the summary judgment standard is ''Doe v. Cahill'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/%28azug0gfogzf1wl55keulbk55%29/Download.aspx?ID=67130 884 A.2d 451 (pdf)] (Del. 2005).  Retrieved on 2009-03-15.&lt;/ref&gt; in which a city council member sued an anonymous poster for two allegedly [[defamatory]] [[blog]] comments.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 454.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Delaware Supreme Court]] held that the plaintiff had failed to demonstrate that the comments were "capable of a defamatory meaning," an essential element of any defamation claim.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 466-67.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the plaintiff was not entitled to discovery of the Doe defendant's identity.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 468.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other courts have applied a "[[prima facie]] showing" test, which functions like the summary judgment test but avoids the "potentially confusing" attachment of a procedural label, since the standards governing such motions may differ depending on the [[jurisdiction]].&lt;ref&gt;''Krinsky v. Doe 6'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20090325151157/http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/opinions/archive/H030767.PDF 159 Cal. App. 4th 1154 (pdf)] (2008).  Retrieved on 2009-03-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Krinsky v. Doe 6'', the [[California Court of Appeals]] applied the prima facie showing test in the [[libel]] context, holding that "[w]here it is clear to the court that discovery of the defendant's identity is necessary to pursue the plaintiff's claim, the court may refuse to quash a third-party subpoena if the plaintiff succeeds in setting forth evidence that a libelous statement has been made."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 1172.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prima facie standard was also favored by a [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|New York state district court]] in ''[[Sony Music Entertainment]] Inc. v. Does''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/courtweb/pdf/D02NYSC/04-05366.PDF 326 F. Supp. 2d 556 (pdf)] (S.D.N.Y. 2004). Retrieved on 2009-03-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  The court first found that the Doe defendants, who had used a [[peer-to-peer]] network to download [[copyrighted]] music files, warranted a lesser degree of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protection than speakers who engaged in "true expression" intended "to communicate a thought or convey an idea."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 564.&lt;/ref&gt;  It then held that disclosure of the Doe defendants' identities was warranted based on a consideration of: (1) the plaintiff's ability to establish a prima facie claim; (2) the specificity of the plaintiff's discovery request; (3) the availability of alternative means to obtain the subpoenaed information; (4) the central need for discovery to advance the plaintiff's claim; and (5) the defendants' expectation of [[privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 564-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summary judgment standard followed by balancing===
This test provides a higher level of protection to anonymous online speakers, in that it requires a court to first apply the summary judgment standard of ''Doe v. Cahill'' and then, if the plaintiff is able to meet its burden, to balance the strength of the plaintiff's prima facie case against the poster's interest in remaining anonymous.

A [[New Jersey Superior Court#Appellate Division|New Jersey appellate court]] applied this hybrid test in ''[[Dendrite International, Inc. v. Doe No. 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pub.bna.com/eclr/277400t3.htm 775 A.2d 756] (N.J. App. Div. 2001). Retrieved on 2009-03-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  The court set forth five guidelines for judges to follow in deciding whether to compel disclosure of an anonymous poster's identity: (1) the plaintiff must make good faith efforts to notify the poster and give the poster a reasonable opportunity to respond; (2) the plaintiff must specifically identify the poster's allegedly actionable statements; (3) the complaint must set forth a prima facie [[cause of action]]; (4) the plaintiff must support each element of the claim with sufficient evidence; and (5) "the court must balance the defendant's First Amendment right of anonymous free speech against the strength of the prima facie case presented and the necessity for the disclosure of the anonymous defendant's identity to allow the plaintiff to properly proceed."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 760-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called [[Dendrite International, Inc. v. Doe No. 3 | ''Dendrite'' standard]] was adopted by the [[Arizona Supreme Court]] in ''[[Mobilisa, Inc. v. Doe]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cofad1.state.az.us/opinionfiles/CV/CV060521.pdf 170 P.3d 712 (pdf)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313220608/http://www.cofad1.state.az.us/opinionfiles/CV/CV060521.pdf |date=March 13, 2009 }} (Ariz. 2007).  Retrieved on 2009-03-15.&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently, by [[Maryland Court of Appeals|Maryland's highest court]] in ''Independent Newspapers v. Brodie''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdcourts.gov/opinions/coa/2009/63a08.pdf Court of Appeals of Maryland, Feb. 27, 2009, No. 63 (pdf)]. Retrieved on 2009-03-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  After reviewing the treatment of anonymous online speech by other state and federal courts, the Maryland court concluded that "a test requiring notice and opportunity to be heard, coupled with a showing of a prima facie case and the application of a balancing test—such as the standard set forth in ''Dendrite''—most appropriately balances a speaker's constitutional right to anonymous Internet speech with a plaintiff's right to seek judicial redress from defamatory remarks."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 41 (internal citation omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motion to dismiss standard===
Some early cases required plaintiffs to demonstrate that their cause of action could withstand a [[Motion (legal)#Motion to dismiss|motion to dismiss]].  This standard holds plaintiffs to a much lower evidentiary burden than the summary judgment standard, as it only requires the allegation of facts that, if true, would entitle the plaintiff to a [[legal remedy]].

A [[Northern district of california|California district court]] applied this standard in one of the first cases to consider the discovery of an anonymous online speaker's identity, ''Columbia Insurance Co. v. Seescandy.com''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property00/domain/Sees.html 185 F.R.D. 573] (N.D. Cal. 1999). Retrieved on 2009-03-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  The court analogized the motion to dismiss standard to the requirement in a criminal investigation that the government show [[probable cause]] before obtaining a [[warrant (law)|warrant]], in that both prerequisites were necessary to "prevent abuse."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 579.&lt;/ref&gt;  The court concluded that an anonymous poster could only be unmasked if the plaintiff made "some showing that an act giving rise to civil liability actually occurred and that the discovery [was] aimed at revealing specific identifying features of the person or entity who committed that act."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 580.&lt;/ref&gt;  Inconsistent with a motion to dismiss standard, the court also relied on evidence of actual confusion in finding a basis for allowing discovery to identify the anonymous speaker.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 580.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Good faith standard===
Under a good faith standard, plaintiffs are simply required to show that their claim is made in [[good faith]] and not with the intent to harass the Doe defendant.  In an early case, the [[Circuit Court]] of [[Virginia]] applied this standard in ''In re [[Subpoena duces tecum|Subpoena Duces Tecum]] to [[America Online]]'', holding that a court may compel an ISP to reveal a subscriber's identity if it finds "that the party requesting the subpoena has a legitimate, good faith basis to contend that it may be the victim of conduct actionable in the jurisdiction" and that "the identity information is centrally needed to advance that claim."&lt;ref&gt;[http://pub.bna.com/eclr/40570.htm 2000 WL 1210372, *8] (Vir. Cir. Ct. Jan. 31, 2000). Retrieved on 2009-03-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Doe v. 2themart.com Inc.]], the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington required  showing of good faith, as well as the compelling need for the discovery of the identifying information.

Courts and commentators have subsequently deemed this standard the "most deferential to plaintiffs," as "it offers no practical, reliable way to determine the plaintiff's good faith and leaves the speaker with little protection."&lt;ref&gt;''Krinsky'', 159 Cal. App. 4th at 1167; ''see also'' Ryan M. Martin, ''Freezing the Net: Rejecting a One-Size-Fits-All Standard for Unmasking Anonymous Internet Speakers in Defamation Lawsuits'', 75 U. Cin. L. Rev. 1217, 1228 (2007) (referring to the good faith standard as "extremely deferential to plaintiffs' allegations").&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statutory limitations to obtaining IP addresses==
Federal privacy statutes may limit a plaintiff's ability to gain access to an ISP's subscriber records.

===Cable TV Privacy Act of 1984===
Under the [[Cable TV Privacy Act]] of 1984,&lt;ref&gt;[[47 U.S.C.]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/551- § 551].&lt;/ref&gt; a cable ISP may be required to notify its subscribers and obtain consent before disclosing any personally identifiable information, but the statute provides limited exceptions to the consent requirement, including disclosure made pursuant to a [[court order]].&lt;ref&gt;''See Cahill'', 884 A.2d at 455, n.4; ''but see In re United States'', [http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/courtweb/pdf/D02NYSC/01-08945.PDF 157 F. Supp. 2d 286, 290-92 (pdf)] (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (holding that [[ECPA]], and not the Cable Act, applied to government access of internet subscriber records).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic Communications Privacy Act===
The [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]]&lt;ref name="§ 2703d"&gt;[[18 U.S.C.]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/2703.html § 2703(d)].&lt;/ref&gt; restricts government and private access to computer records. Thus, in order to unmask the author of an anonymous post through the legal process, the individual seeking the information must comply with ECPA. There is no provision within ECPA, other than voluntary disclosure or with consent, that allows civil litigants to force an ISP or website to reveal the contents of a user's emails via a subpoena.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''O'Grady v. Super. Ct.'', [http://www.precydent.com/OriginalVersion/H028579.PDF?id=88603 139 Cal. App. 4th 1423 (pdf)]{{dead link|date=March 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} (2006) (holding that ECPA prohibited disclosure of emails in connection with a subpoena); [[Federal Trade Commission|''Fed. Trade Comm'n'']] ''v.'' [[Netscape|''Netscape Commc'ns Corp.'']], [http://pub.bna.com/lw/00026.htm 196 F.R.D. 559] (N.D. Cal. 2000) (denying FTC's motion to compel disclosure of customer information because of ECPA); 18 U.S.C. § 2703 (only government entities can force disclosure). ''But see Flagg v. [[City of Detroit]]'', [http://www.electronicdiscoveryblog.com/cases/flagg.pdf 252 F.R.D. 346 (pdf)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222110617/http://www.electronicdiscoveryblog.com/cases/flagg.pdf |date=February 22, 2012 }} ([[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan|E.D. Mich.]] 2008) (finding that a subpoena can be used to force a party to consent to disclosure).&lt;/ref&gt; However, a private party in a lawsuit may force an ISP to disclose non-content records (e.g. the name of the owner of an account, a list of email addresses to whom emails were sent, access times, etc.) through a subpoena.  In addition, the government can obtain the records needed to identify the person behind an IP address using a subpoena.  In order to obtain more detailed transactional records, the government would be required to obtain a court order by setting forth "specific and articulable facts show that there are reasonable grounds to believe...the records...are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation."&lt;ref name="§ 2703d"/&gt;

'''Estera''' is a global provider of corporate, trust, fund and accounting services.   The company was created following a [[management buyout]] of the fiduciary group of [[Appleby (law firm)|Appleby]]. It rebranded as Estera in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estera.com/about/our-history.aspx|title=ESTERA - Our history|website=Estera.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estera employs 550 people and has offices in 11 jurisdictions: Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Isle of Man, Jersey, Luxembourg, Malta, Mauritius, United Kingdom.  

Gary O'Connor, the managing director of Estera Trust (Isle of Man) Limited, was shortlisted for the [[Institute of Directors]] Young Director of the Year award in September 2017.&lt;ref name="iod"&gt;{{cite web|title=Events {{!}} IoD|url=https://www.iod.com/events-community/events/event-details/eventdateid/4363|website=Iod.com|publisher=Institute of Directors|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=History=
In December 2015, "[[Appleby (law firm)|Appleby]] Fiduciary Business (AFB)", a Bermuda registered company and a branch of the law firm Appleby, was separated out legally from Appleby (Bermuda) through a management buy out by the private equity firm "Bridgepoint".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Appleby Fiduciary changes name to Estera |url=http://www.royalgazette.com/business/article/20160419/appleby-fiduciary-changes-name-to-estera |accessdate=14 August 2018 |publisher=The Royal Gazette |date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, it changed its name to "Estera", with the Group Chief Executive Officer being Farah Ballands&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://estera.com/profile/view/366/Farah-Ballands|title=ESTERA {{!}} Profile|website=estera.com|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The company operates from the same office as Appleby Bermuda, at Canon's court, 22 Victoria street located in [[Bermuda|Bermuda's]] capital [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Management Buyout of Appleby Fiduciary Business Completes |url=https://estera.com/news/news-2016/january-2016---management-buyout-of-appleby-fiduciary-business-completes.aspx |accessdate=14 August 2018 |agency=Company press release |publisher=Estera |date=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company has offices in 11 locations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://estera.com/jurisdictions/|title=ESTERA {{!}} Jurisdictions|website=estera.com|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The name of the new company was chosen based on inputs from their staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Appleby Fiduciary Business rebrands as Estera |url=https://www.weareguernsey.com/news/2016/appleby-fiduciary-business-rebrands-as-estera/ |accessdate=14 August 2018 |publisher=We Are Guernsey |date=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estera was involved in the [[Paradise Papers]] leak. 

=Subsequent Acquisitions=
In 2017, Estera acquired Morgan Sharpe (in Guernsey), Heritage financial services group (in Belfast and Malta) and Headstart s.a.r.l (Luxembourg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our history and timeline  (1890 to 2017) |url=https://estera.com/about/our-history.aspx |website=Estera |publisher=Estera official website |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gwoyeu Romatzyh''' ([[pinyin]]: ''Guóyǔ luómǎzì'', literally "National [[Language]] [[Romanization]]"),&lt;ref&gt;{{zh|s=国语罗马字|t=國語羅馬字|p=Guóyǔ Luómǎzì}}. In 1937 the sinologist Trittel coined the German translation "Lateinumschrift der Reichssprache" (DeFrancis[1950]: Ch 4, footnote 4).
&lt;/ref&gt; abbreviated '''GR''', is a system for writing [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] in the [[Latin alphabet]]. The system was conceived by [[Yuen Ren Chao]] and developed by a group of [[linguistics|linguists]] including Chao and [[Lin Yutang]] from 1925 to 1926. Chao himself later published influential works in linguistics using GR. In addition a small number of other textbooks and dictionaries in GR were published in [[Hong Kong]] and overseas from 1942 to 2000.
[[File:TPE-PWD-PSLO Taytzyy Greening Area stone 20160806.jpg|thumb|right|Gwoyeu Romatzyh in use on a park sign in Taipei. Taytzyy = 太子 = Tàizǐ]]

GR is the better known of the two romanization systems which indicate the four [[Standard Chinese_phonology#Tones|tones of Mandarin]] by varying the spelling of syllables ("tonal spelling").&lt;ref&gt;The only other romanization system to utilize tonal spelling is [[Simplified Wade]], a modified form of [[Wade–Giles]] devised by Swedish linguist [[Olov Bertil Anderson]].&lt;/ref&gt; These tones are as fundamental to the Chinese language as vowels are to English; their presence [[Phoneme|lets speakers discriminate]] between otherwise identical syllables and words.&lt;ref&gt;"A word pronounced in a wrong tone or inaccurate tone sounds as puzzling as if one said ''bud'' in English, meaning 'not good' or 'the thing one sleeps in.'" Chao(1948):24.&lt;/ref&gt; Other systems indicate the tones with either [[diacritic]]s (for example [[Pinyin]]: ''āi, ái, ǎi'' and ''ài'') or numbers ([[Wade–Giles]]: ''ai&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ai&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', etc.). GR spells the four tones of the same vowel, ''ai'', ''ai'''r''''', ''a'''e''''' and ''a'''y'''''.&lt;ref&gt;In these examples ''air'' (''ái'') with a rising tone means "cancer", while ''ay'' (''ài'') with a falling tone means "love".&lt;/ref&gt; These spellings, which follow specific [[Spelling in Gwoyeu Romatzyh#Tonal rules|rules]], indicate the tones while retaining the pronunciation of the syllable ''ai''.

Chao claimed that, because GR embeds the tone of each syllable in its spelling,&lt;ref&gt;"The common [foreign] attitude of treating the tone as an [[epiphenomenon]] on top of the solid sounds—consonants and vowels—is to the Chinese mind quite unintelligible..." Chao and Yang(1947):xv.&lt;/ref&gt; it may [[#Language learning|help students to master Chinese tones]]. One study of GR, however, found the opposite to be true.&lt;ref&gt;"The results clearly indicated that GR did not lead to significantly greater accuracy in tonal production. Indeed, the use of GR reflected slightly lower rates of tonal production accuracy for native speakers of both American English and Japanese."  McGinnis(1997).&lt;/ref&gt; GR uses a complicated system of tonal spelling that obscures the basic relationship between spelling and tone; for example, the difference between tones 1 and 2 is variously indicated as ''mha'' vs. ''ma'', ''ching'' vs. ''chyng'', ''chang'' vs. ''charng'', etc.  Although tonal spelling has been adopted as part of the normal romanization of a number of Asian languages (e.g. [[Hmong language|Hmong]]), all such systems indicate different tones in a simple and consistent fashion by adding letters to the end of a syllable (e.g. in Hmong, ''-b'' indicates high tone, ''-s'' indicates low tone, ''-j'' indicates high-falling tone, etc.).

In 1928 China adopted GR as the nation's official romanization system.&lt;ref name="Kratochvíl1968:169"&gt;Kratochvíl(1968):169&lt;/ref&gt; GR was used to indicate pronunciations in dictionaries of the National (Mandarin-based) Language. Its proponents hoped one day to establish it as a writing system for a reformed Chinese script. But despite support from a small number of trained linguists in China and overseas, GR met with public indifference and even hostility due to its complexity.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed account of the historical background, see {{cite web | author = John DeFrancis | url= http://www.pinyin.info/readings/texts/DeFr1950.html | title= Chapter 4 of DeFrancis(1950) | publisher = pinyin.info | accessdate=2007-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another obstacle preventing its widespread adoption was its narrow basis on the Beijing dialect, in a period lacking a strong centralized government to enforce its use. Eventually GR lost ground to [[Pinyin]] and other later romanization systems. However, its influence is still evident, as several of the principles introduced by its creators have been used in romanization systems that followed it. Its pattern of tone spelling was retained in the standard spelling of the Chinese province of [[Shaanxi]] ''(shǎnxī, 陝西),'' which cannot be distinguished from [[Shanxi]] ''(shānxī, 山西)'' when written in pinyin without diacritics.

==History==
[[File:Linyutang.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lin Yutang]], who first proposed tonal spelling]]
[[#Tonal modifications|Tonal spelling]], Gwoyeu Romatzyh's most distinctive feature, was first suggested to Y.R. Chao by [[Lin Yutang]].&lt;ref&gt;"Without disclaiming responsibility, as a very active member of the Committee on Unification, for the merits and defects of the system, I must give credit to my colleague Lin Yutang for the idea of varying the spelling to indicate difference in tone." Chao(1948):11 footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the historical background see {{cite web | author = John DeFrancis | url= http://www.pinyin.info/readings/texts/DeFr1950.html | title= One State, One People, One Language | publisher = Pinyin.info | accessdate=2007-02-27}} (Chapter 4 of DeFrancis[1950]).&lt;/ref&gt; By 1922 Chao had already established the main principles of GR.&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis(1950): Ch 4, footnotes 43 and 46.&lt;/ref&gt;
The details of the system were developed in 1925–1926 by a group of five linguists, led by Chao and including Lin, under the auspices of the [[Mandarin Promotion Council|Preparatory Commission for the Unification of the National Language]].&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis(1950): 74&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 GR was officially adopted by the government.&lt;ref name="Kratochvíl1968:169"/&gt; GR was intended to be used alongside the existing [[Zhuyin|''Juhin'' (''Zhùyīn'')]] phonetic symbols: hence the alternative name for GR, "Second Pattern of the National Alphabet."&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|cmn-Hans|国音字母第二式}} / ''Gwoin Tzyhmuu Dihell Shyh'' / ''Guóyīn Zìmǔ Dì'èr Shì'': see Simon, W.(1947):Table X, lxxi.&lt;/ref&gt; Both systems were used to indicate the revised standard of pronunciation in the new official ''Vocabulary of National Pronunciation for Everyday Use'' of 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|cmn-Hans|国音常用字汇}} / ''Gwoin Charngyonq Tzyhhuey'' / ''Guóyīn Chángyòng Zìhuì'': see Chao(1948):11.&lt;/ref&gt; The designers of GR had greater ambitions: their aim was complete reform of the script, using GR as a practical system of writing.&lt;ref&gt;"While the official position was that it was to be used whenever Chinese was to be spelled in Latin letters, such as in dealing with foreigners, those who devised the system, of whom I was one, had in our minds the design of a practical system of writing." Chao(1968c)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Zhao Yuanren.jpg|thumb|right|[[Yuen Ren Chao]], the chief designer of GR, as a young man (c. 1916)]]

In the 1930s two shortlived attempts were made to teach GR to railway workers and peasants in [[Henan|Hénán]] and [[Shandong|Shāndōng]] provinces.&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis(1950): 77–78&lt;/ref&gt; Support for GR, being confined to a small number of trained linguists and Sinologists, "was distinguished more for its quality than its quantity."&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis(1950): 75. The supporters included [[Qian Xuantong]] and [[Luo Changpei]] in China and [[Walter Simon (sinologist)|Walter Simon]] in England.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period GR faced increasing hostility because of the complexity of its tonal spelling. Conversely, Sinologist [[Bernhard Karlgren]] criticised GR for its lack of phonetic rigour.&lt;ref&gt;"[GR] is based on a series of very fatal phonetic lies, and for this reason it will be very difficult to learn, and consequently impractical." Karlgren(1928):20&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, like the rival (toneless) system [[Latinxua Sinwenz]], GR failed to gain widespread support, principally because the "National" language was too narrowly based on [[Beijing dialect|Beijing speech]]:&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis(1950):76&lt;/ref&gt; "a sufficiently precise and strong language norm had not yet become a reality in China".&lt;ref&gt;Kratochvíl(1968):169.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;span id="shaan"&gt;A vestigial use of GR&lt;/span&gt; can be seen in the official spelling of the first syllable of ''Shaanxi'' for [[Shaanxi|Shǎnxī]] (陝西) province, to distinguish it from [[Shanxi|Shānxī]] (山西) province, particularly in foreign-language text where the tone marks are often omitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_1495089 |title=涨知识｜陕西为什么拼作Shaanxi，而不是Shanxi_中国政库_澎湃新闻-The Paper |website=www.thepaper.cn |access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some prominent Chinese have used GR to transliterate their names: for example the mathematician [[Shiing-Shen Chern]].&lt;ref&gt;Neither Chao nor Lin, however, followed this practice.&lt;/ref&gt; The romanization system was changed by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1958 to the current system used now in the country, and other foreign and international institutions, like the [[United Nations]], the [[Library of Congress]], the [[International Organization for Standardization]], and is widely used to teach [[Mandarin Chinese]] to foreign students: [[Hanyu Pinyin]]. Meanwhile, in the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), GR survived until the 1970s as a pronunciation aid in monolingual dictionaries such as ''Gwoyeu Tsyrdean [Guóyǔ Cídiǎn]'' and ''Tsyrhuey [Cíhuì]'',&lt;ref&gt;For an account of the phonetization of Chinese in Taiwan, see Chen(1999):189&lt;/ref&gt; but was officially replaced in 1986 by a modified form known as [[Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Wi-vun Taiffalo Chiung | url=http://www.de-han.org/pehoeji/lomaji/4.htm

==Description==
{{main article|Spelling in Gwoyeu Romatzyh}}
:''Note:'' In this section the word "tone" is abbreviated as "T": thus T1 stands for Tone 1 (first tone), etc. To assist readers unfamiliar with GR, Pinyin equivalents have been added in brackets.

===Basic forms (Tone 1)===
{{IPA notice}}
An important feature of GR, adopted from other precursors and later also adopted by [[Pinyin]], is the use of contrasting [[voice (phonetics)|unvoiced/voiced]] pairs of consonants from Latin to represent [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated and unaspirated]] sounds in Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;See Chao(1948):19–24 and Chao(1968a):20–25 for tables and fuller discussion. Complete tables of GR initials and finals are also given in [[Spelling in Gwoyeu Romatzyh#Basic forms]].&lt;/ref&gt; For example ''b'' and ''p'' represent {{IPA|/p/}} and {{IPA|/pʰ/}} (''p'' and ''p‘'' in Wade).  Another distinctive feature of GR is the use of ''j, ch,'' and ''sh'' to represent two different series of sounds. When followed by ''i'' these letters correspond to the [[alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal]] sounds  (Pinyin ''j, q,'' and ''x''); otherwise they correspond to the [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] sounds (Pinyin ''zh, ch,'' and ''sh''). Readers used to Pinyin need to pay particular attention to these spellings: for example, GR ''ju, jiu,'' and ''jiou'' correspond to Pinyin ''zhu, ju,'' and ''jiu'' respectively.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Spelling in Gwoyeu Romatzyh#Pinyin comparison: basic forms|Spelling in Gwoyeu Romatzyh]] for a table showing the correspondence of GR and Pinyin forms.&lt;/ref&gt;

GR orthography has these additional notable features:

*''iu'' represents the [[close front rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/y/}} spelled ''ü'' or in many cases simply ''u'' in Pinyin.
*Final ''-y'' represents the {{IPA-cmn|ɨ|}} [[allophone]] of ''i'': GR ''shy'' and ''sy'' correspond to Pinyin ''shi'' and  ''si'' respectively.
*''el'' corresponds to Pinyin ''er'' (''-r'' being reserved to indicate Tone2). The most important use of ''-(e)l'' is as a [[R-colored vowel|rhotacization]] suffix, as in ''ideal'' = ''i dean'' + ''-(e)l'', "a little" (yìdiǎnr).
*A number of frequently occurring [[morpheme]]s have abbreviated spellings in GR. The commonest of these are: ''-g'' (-ge), ''-j'' (-zhe), ''-m'' (-me), ''sh'' (shi) and ''-tz'' (-zi).&lt;ref&gt;These and other abbreviations are listed in Chao(1968a):xxx.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tonal modifications===
By default, the basic GR spelling described above is used for Tone1 syllables. The basic form is then modified to indicate tones 2, 3 and 4.&lt;ref&gt;The rules are given, though in a different form, in Chao (1948): 28–30 (synopsis p 336) and Chao (1968a): 29–30 (synopsis p 847). See also Table IX in Simon, W.(1947):lviii.&lt;/ref&gt; This is accomplished in one of three ways:

*'''either''' a vowel is changed to another vowel resembling it in sound (''i'' to ''y'', for example, or ''u'' to ''w'')
*'''or''' a letter is doubled
*'''or''' a silent letter (''r'' or ''h'') is added after the vowel.

Wherever possible the concise first method is used. The following rules of thumb cover most cases.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Spelling in Gwoyeu Romatzyh#Tonal rules]] for a more thorough discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tone 1 (basic form)'''

:''shiue, chuan, chang, hai, bau'' (xuē, chuān, chāng, hāi, bāo)

'''&lt;span style="color:blue" id="T2Rule"&gt;Tone 2: i/u → y/w; or add -r&lt;/span&gt;'''
:''sh&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;ue, ch&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;an, cha&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;ng, hai&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;, bau&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;'' (xué, chuán, cháng, hái, báo)

'''&lt;span style="color:fuchsia" id="T3Rule"&gt;Tone 3: i/u → e/o; or double vowel&lt;/span&gt;'''

:''sh&lt;span style="color:fuchsia"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;ue, ch&lt;span style="color:fuchsia"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;an, ch&lt;span style="color:fuchsia"&gt;aa&lt;/span&gt;ng, ha&lt;span style="color:fuchsia"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;, ba&lt;span style="color:fuchsia"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;'' (xuě, chuǎn, chǎng, hǎi, bǎo)

'''&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;Tone 4: change/double final letter; or add -h&lt;/span&gt;'''

:''shiue&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;, chua&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;nn&lt;/span&gt;, cha&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;nq&lt;/span&gt;, ha&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;, ba&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;'' (xuè, chuàn, chàng, hài, bào)

'''Neutral tone: precede with a dot (full stop)'''

:''pe&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;ng.yeou, di&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;.fang'' (péngyou, dìfang).

'''Exception''' Syllables with an initial [[sonorant]] (''l-/m-/n-/r-'') use the basic form for T2 rather than T1. In these syllables the (rarer) T1 is marked with ''-h-'' as the second letter. For example ''mha'' is T1 (mā), whereas ''ma'' is T2 (má).&lt;ref&gt;Examples: (T1) ''Mha.mha'' ({{lang|cmn-Hans|妈妈}} ''Māma''), "Mum"; (T2) ''mamuh'' ({{lang|cmn-Hani|麻木}} ''mámù''), "numb".&lt;/ref&gt; T3 and T4 are regular: ''maa'' (''mǎ'') and ''mah'' (''mà'').

==Compounds as words==
An important principle of GR is that syllables which form words should be written together. This strikes speakers of European languages as obvious; but in Chinese the concept of "word" is not easy to pin down. The basic unit of speech is popularly thought to be the monosyllable represented by a [[Written Chinese#Chinese characters (2)|character]] ({{lang|cmn-Hani|字}} ''tzyh'', ''zì''), which in most cases represents a meaningful syllable or [[morpheme]],&lt;ref&gt;Chao calls the character the "sociological word", since it is the unit by which children's vocabulary is measured, journalists are paid and telegrams charged for. Chao(1968a): 136.&lt;/ref&gt; a smaller unit than the "linguistic word".&lt;ref&gt;For thorough discussions, see Chao(1968a): 138–143 and Kratochvíl(1968):89–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Characters are written and printed with no spaces between words; yet in practice most [[Chinese language#Grammar and morphology|Chinese words]] consist of two-syllable compounds, and it was Chao's bold innovation in 1922 to reflect this in GR [[orthography]] by grouping the appropriate syllables together into words.&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis(1950): Ch 4, note 46.&lt;/ref&gt; This represented a radical departure from hyphenated Wade–Giles forms such as ''Kuo&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-yü&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Lo&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-ma&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-tzu&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'' (the Wade spelling of GR).

==Use in published texts==
Chao used GR in four influential works:
*''[[Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese]]'' (in collaboration with [[Yang Lien-sheng|Lien Sheng Yang]]) (1947)
*''Mandarin Primer''&lt;ref&gt;Recordings, including online excerpts, of this lively, though now rather dated, text are available from
{{cite web | author = Yuen Ren Chao | url= http://www.folkways.si.edu/search/AlbumDetails.aspx?ID=1407# | title= Mandarin Primer | publisher = Smithsonian Folkways Recordings | accessdate=2007-02-27| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051027101123/http://www.folkways.si.edu/search/AlbumDetails.aspx?ID=1407| archivedate = October 27, 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (1948)

*''A Grammar of Spoken Chinese''&lt;ref&gt;"The most comprehensive grammar of MSC [Modern Standard Chinese] in English." Kratochvíl(1968):187.&lt;/ref&gt; (1968a)
*&lt;div id="sayable"&gt;''Readings in Sayable Chinese''&lt;ref&gt;Cassette recordings of this text are available from various online sources.&lt;/ref&gt; (1968b) &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[#Example|Extract]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/div&gt; "Sayable" in this context means colloquial,&lt;ref&gt;Chao describes the colloquial Chinese heard on the street as "sayable, even if sometimes unspeakable". (Chao 1968b): I,vi)&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to the [[vernacular Chinese]] (''bairhuah'', Pinyin ''báihuà'') style often read by students.

''Readings in Sayable Chinese'' was written "to supply the advanced student of spoken Chinese with reading matter which he can actually use in his speech."&lt;ref&gt;Chao(1968b): I,iv&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of three volumes of Chinese text with facing GR romanization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Yuen Ren Chao | url= http://www.pinyin.info/readings/sayable_chinese.html | title= Readings in Sayable Chinese: table of contents | publisher = pinyin.info | accessdate=2007-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contain some lively recorded dialogues, "Fragments of an autobiography," two plays and a translation of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]] (Tzoou daw Jinqtz lii)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|cmn-Hant|走到鏡子裡跟阿麗思看見裡頭有些什麼}} ''Tzoou daw Jinqtz lii gen Alihsy Kannjiann Liitou Yeou Shie Sherme / Zǒu dào jìngzili gēn Ālìsī kànjian lǐtou yǒu xiē shénme''.&lt;/ref&gt; Two extracts from ''Tzoou daw Jinqtz lii'' with facing translations can be read online.&lt;ref&gt;The extracts comprise Alice's conversations with Tweedledum and Tweedledee ({{cite web | author = Lewis Carroll [Y.R. Chao trans.] | url= http://home.iprimus.com.au/richwarm/gr/tweedle.htm | title= Yuen Ren Chao in Wonderland | publisher = Richard Warmington | accessdate=2007-03-12}}) and Humpty Dumpty ({{cite web | author = Lewis Carroll [Y.R. Chao trans.] | url= http://pinyin.info/readings/alice/humpty_dumpty_chinese.html | title= Humpty Dumpty in Mandarin Chinese | publisher = Pinyin.info | accessdate=2007-03-15}}). The second webpage also includes a version of the text in Pinyin.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942 [[Walter Simon (sinologist)|Walter Simon]] introduced GR to English-speaking sinologists in a special pamphlet, ''The New Official Chinese Latin Script''. Over the remainder of the 1940s he published a series of textbooks and readers,&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Walter Simon (sinologist)|complete list]] of these publications.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a Chinese-English Dictionary, all using GR. His son Harry Simon later went on to use GR in scholarly papers on Chinese linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Simon, H.F.(1958).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 Y.C. Liu, a colleague of Walter Simon's at [[SOAS]], published ''Fifty Chinese Stories''. These selections from [[Chinese classic texts|classical texts]] were presented in both [[classical Chinese|classical]] and modern Chinese,&lt;ref&gt;"[The book's] primary aim is to introduce students to the Classical style through the medium of the modern spoken language." Liu (1960):xii (Introduction by W. Simon)&lt;/ref&gt; together with GR romanizations and [[Romanization of Japanese|romanized Japanese]] versions prepared by Simon (by that time Professor [[Emeritus]] of Chinese in the [[University of London]]).

[[Lin Yutang]]'s ''[[Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage]]'' (1972) incorporated a number of innovative features, one of which was a simplified version of GR.&lt;ref name="lindict"&gt;"In the original edition, 'Guoryuu Romatzyh' ({{lang|cmn-Hant|國語羅馬字}}) was used as the scheme for romanization."  Another feature was an "Instant Index System": "an invention by Lin Yutang with the intention of providing a simple and unambiguous rule to call up any given Chinese character ... [T]his index system has not been widely used since its inception."  {{cite web | author = Lin Yutang | url = http://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/Lindict/lyt-fl.htm | title = Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage (Online Version) | publisher = Chinese University of Hong Kong | accessdate=2007-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ching(1975).&lt;/ref&gt; Lin eliminated most of the spelling rules requiring substitution of vowels, as can be seen from his spelling ''Guo&lt;span style="color:blue"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;y&lt;span style="color:fuchsia"&gt;uu&lt;/span&gt; Romatzyh'',&lt;ref name="lindict"/&gt; in which the regular [[#T2Rule|''-r'' is used for T2]] and a [[#T3Rule|doubled vowel for T3]].

The first 3 issues of the ''Shin Tarng'' magazine (which would be ''Xīn Táng'' in Pinyin; published in 1982-1989) used a Simplified Romanisation ({{lang|cmn-Hant|簡化羅馬字}} {{lang|cmn-Latn|Jiannhuah Rormaatzyh}}) based on Gwoyeu Romatzyh; the fourth edition, entitled Xin Talng, used Pinyin with Gwoyeu Romatzyh-like tone marking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinyin.info/readings/xin_tang/ Xin Tang: a journal of romanized Mandarin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language learning==
Chao believed that the benefit of GR was to make tonal differences more salient to learners:
{{cquote|[GR] makes the spelling more complicated, but gives an ''individuality to the physiognomy of words'', with which it is possible to associate meaning ... [A]s an instrument of teaching, tonal spelling has proved in practice to be a most powerful aid in enabling the student to grasp the material with precision and clearness.&lt;ref&gt;Chao(1948):11 (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
For example, it may be easier to memorize the difference between GR ''Beeijing'' (the city) and ''beyjiing'' ("background") than the Pinyin versions ''Běijīng'' and ''bèijǐng'', where the tones seem to be almost an afterthought. One study conducted at the [[University of Oregon]] in 1991–1993, compared the results of using Pinyin and GR in teaching elementary level Chinese to two matched groups of students, and concluded that "GR did not lead to significantly greater accuracy in tonal production."&lt;ref&gt;McGinnis(1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

GR continues to be used by some teachers of Chinese. In 2000, the Princeton ''Chinese Primer'' series was published in both GR and Pinyin versions.&lt;ref&gt;Ch'en et al.(2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Here is an extract from Y.R. Chao's [[#sayable|''Sayable Chinese'']]. The topic is scholarly ("What is Sinology?"), but the style colloquial. The tonal spelling markers or "clues" are again highlighted using the same [[#Tonal modifications|color-coding scheme]] as above. Versions in [[#chin|Chinese characters]], [[#pin|Pinyin]] and [[#eng|English]] are given below the GR text.

|&lt;span id="eng"&gt;English translation&lt;/span&gt;
|The term "Sinology" carries a slight overtone of disrespect towards China. One hears of "Indology," "Egyptology" and "Sinology," but never "Grecology" or "Romology"—let alone "Anglology" or "Americology."  The term "Sinology" epitomizes European and American scholars' patronizing attitude towards the culture of those ruined ancient empires.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22590">{{legal status}}
'''Immigration law''' refers to the national [[statute]]s, [[Primary and secondary legislation|regulations]], and [[Precedent|legal precedents]] governing [[immigration]] into and [[deportation]] from a [[country]]. Strictly speaking, it is distinct from other matters such as [[naturalization]] and [[citizenship]], although they are often conflated. Immigration laws vary around the world, as well as according to the [[Society|social]] and [[political climate]] of the times, as acceptance of immigrants sways from the widely inclusive to the deeply [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Isolationism|isolationist]]. Countries frequently maintain laws which regulate both the rights of entry and exit as well as internal rights, such as the duration of stay, [[freedom of movement]], and the right to participate in [[commerce]] or [[government]].

National laws regarding the immigration of citizens of that country are regulated by [[international law]]. The [[United Nations|United Nations']] [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] mandates&lt;ref&gt;art 12(4)&lt;/ref&gt; that all countries allow entry to their own citizens.

==Control measures==
To control immigration, many countries set up customs at entry points.  Some common location for entry points are airports and roads near the border.  At the customs department, [[travel document]]s are inspected.  Some required documents are a [[passport]], an [[Carte Jaune|international certificate of vaccination]] and an [[onward ticket]].  Sometimes travelers are also required to declare or register the amount of money they are carrying.

==Comparison of immigration visa categories by country or territory==
&lt;!-- Comment - TBD --&gt;

| (practically not available since April 2011) [[Tier 1 General]] – settlement (ILR) after 5 years. A limit on 1000 Tier 1 migrants per year introduced by new government. Besides that the migration legislation changes on average every six months which makes Britain not attractive for skilled migrants looking for a second nationality.
| [[Tier 1 Entrepreneur]]
| [[Tier 1 Investor]]
| There is no specific category here but it is easier for universities (as opposed to businesses) to acquire a Tier 2 sponsorship licence. 
| ILR is provided after 5 years in marriage or partnership and living in the country.
| British citizenship can be obtained as a right for anybody who was born in the UK before 1983. After 1983, it can only be obtained by birth if at least one parent was settled there.

'''John Theodore Wisniski'''&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/may/09/local/me-61326|title=Johnny Valentine; Plane Crash Cut Short Pro Wrestler's Career|accessdate=2009-03-21|date=2001-05-09|work= Los Angeles Times|location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt; (September 22, 1928 &amp;ndash; April 24, 2001), better known by his ring name '''Johnny Valentine''', was an [[United States|American]] [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] with a career spanning almost three decades. He has been inducted into four halls of fame for his achievements in wrestling. Wisniski is the father of professional wrestler [[Greg Valentine|Greg "The Hammer" Valentine]].

He held numerous regional titles, including the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship. He had long running rivalries with [[Bobo Brazil]], [[Pat O'Connor (wrestler)|Pat O'Connor]], [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]], [[Antonino Rocca|Antonio Rocca]], [[Lou Thesz]], [[Harley Race]], [[Ed Farhat|The Sheik]], [[Wahoo McDaniel]], [[Fritz von Erich]], [[Bruno Sammartino]], [[Johnny Powers (wrestler)|Johnny Powers]], [[Antonio Inoki]] and [[Jack Brisco|Jack]] &amp; [[Gerald Brisco|Jerry Brisco]]. He alternated between being a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] and a hero (babyface) during the Golden Era in the 1940s through 1960s of wrestling.&lt;ref name=slamobit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBiosV/valentine_obit-can.html|title=Johnny Valentine passes away|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|author=Molinaro, John F.|accessdate=2009-01-05|date=April 24, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, he was injured in a plane crash; he suffered a broken back and was forced to retire from wrestling. He worked briefly as a [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] before retiring altogether. He suffered from several health problems during his retirement, which worsened considerably after a fall in 2000. He died the following year.

==Professional wrestling career==
[[File:Johnny Valentine vs. NWA world wrestling champion Dory Funk Jr. at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto on February 11, 1973.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Valentine vs. [[Dory Funk Jr.]] in 1973]] 
Wisniski debuted as a professional wrestler in 1947, wrestling Karl Nowena in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name=obsessedwithwrestling /&gt; In order to make the matches as believable as possible Wisniski insisted the men he faced in the ring hit him as hard as possible. From that he earned a strong reputation as being a very tough man. On New Year's Day, 1950, [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]] defeated Wisniski in the finals of a United States title tournament.&lt;ref name=obsessedwithwrestling /&gt; He also competed in the NWA's Capitol Wrestling territory. Jerry Graham, who was a co-holder of the Northeast version of the [[WWF United States Tag Team Championship|NWA United States Tag Team Championship]], selected Wisniski in November 1959 to take over the title from Graham's injured partner. They were beaten for the title belts the following April, but Wisniski took on a new partner, Buddy Rogers, to regain the championship by defeating [[The Fabulous Kangaroos]] on November 19, 1960. Wisniski's rivalry with the Kangaroos continued, as the Kangaroos regained the belts in a rematch one week later. Wisniski went over one year without holding a championship before teaming with a new partner, this time Bob Ellis, to defeat the Kangaroos and take back the championship.&lt;ref name=obsessedwithwrestling /&gt; Wisniski &amp; Ellis lost the belts to Buddy Rogers &amp; Handsome Johnny Barend in a match where Arnold Skoaland subbed for Ellis, but the belts were still up, on Washington, DC TV. Rogers &amp; Barend then defeated the real team of Wisniski &amp; Ellis 2 pins to 1 in a main event at Madison Square Garden.

In Toronto, Wisniski and three different partners won the International Tag Team title during 1963. Wisniski left the territory without [[List of professional wrestling terms#D|dropping]] the title.&lt;ref name=obsessedwithwrestling /&gt; He wrestled in Japan in the mid-1960s and had a series of matches against Antonio Inoki. Those matches are regarded as the bouts that helped build Inoki into an elite wrestler in Japan, as Valentine was the highest-profile foreign wrestler Inoki had ever faced at the time. Valentine [[List of professional wrestling terms#P|put over]] Inoki in the matches, [[List of professional wrestling terms#D|dropping]] the Toronto version of the [[NWA United States Heavyweight Championship (Toronto version)|NWA United States Heavyweight Championship]] to him catapulting Inoki's career in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=128|first=Dave|last=Meltzer|title=Tributes II: Remembering More of the World's Greatest Professional Wrestlers|year=2004|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|isbn=1-58261-817-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wisniski also continued to wrestle in the former Capitol Wrestling territory, which had since been renamed the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wide Wrestling Federation]]. While there, he had one last reign with what was then known as the [[WWWF United States Tag Team Championship]], as he teamed with [[Antonio Pugliese|Tony Parisi]] to hold the belts for seven months in 1966.&lt;ref name=obsessedwithwrestling/&gt; Wisniski later [[Turn (professional wrestling)|turned]] on Parisi, however. This ignited a brief feud with [[Bruno Sammartino]], who was billed as Parisi's cousin. Because Wisniski was also wrestling in Texas at the same time, he got only sporadic main event matches against Sammartino during this feud.&lt;ref name=trib131&gt;{{cite book|page=131|first=Dave|last=Meltzer|title=Tributes II: Remembering More of the World's Greatest Professional Wrestlers|year=2004|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|isbn=1-58261-817-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wisniski then moved on to the [[Florida]] territory, where he won the [[NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship]] three times.&lt;ref name=obsessedwithwrestling /&gt; In [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], he defeated [[Tim Woods]] for the NWA Georgia Heavyweight title, on May 10, 1968, and repeated his win in a match against Doug Gilbert (not to be confused with the [[Doug Gilbert]] who was not yet born) to retake the title.&lt;ref name=obsessedwithwrestling /&gt; In Missouri, Wisniski competed for the Missouri Heavyweight Championship in a tournament to determine the inaugural champion. He defeated [[Baron von Raschke]] before withdrawing from the tournament due to focus his efforts on the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]]. After [[Harley Race]] won the tournament and the title belt, Valentine defeated him to win the championship on January 19, 1973.&lt;ref name=obsessedwithwrestling /&gt;&lt;ref name=mo/&gt; He dropped the belt to [[Terry Funk]] the following month. Because Funk used a chair as a weapon in front of the referee, fans demanded a rematch. Valentine was unable to compete due to heart problems, however, so [[Gene Kiniski]] took his place and won the belt from Funk.&lt;ref name=mo&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Missouri State Championship|first=Roger|last=Deem|url=http://www.stlwrestlingfromthechase.com/mobelt.htm|publisher=St. Louis Wrestling from the Chase|accessdate=2009-03-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408195415/http://www.stlwrestlingfromthechase.com/mobelt.htm|archivedate=2008-04-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wrestling at the Chase: The Inside Story of Sam Muchnick and the Legends of Professional Wrestling|first=Larry|last=Matysik|authorlink=Larry Matysik|page=23|publisher=ECW Press|year=2003|isbn=1-55022-684-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1972, Wisniski defeated [[Jacques Rougeau]] for the International Heavyweight Championship, but was stripped of the title in January 1973, after he no-showed the rematch.&lt;ref name=obsessedwithwrestling /&gt;

In the [[National Wrestling Federation]], Wisniski defeated [[Johnny Powers (wrestler)|Johnny Powers]] for the [[NWF North American Heavyweight Championship]] on September 1, 1972. Powers beat Wisniski for the title in October, but Wisniski won the title again from [[Abdullah the Butcher]] on October 19. He was stripped of the title following a match with Johnny Powers. On November 23, he captured the title from Powers, but lost it again in January.&lt;ref name=obsessedwithwrestling /&gt; In the [[Japan Wrestling Association]], Wisniski won the International Tag Team title on February 22, 1973, and then the [[United National Heavyweight Championship]] on March 2. He lost the Tag title on March 6, and the United Heavyweight title on March 8.&lt;ref name=obsessedwithwrestling /&gt; Back in the National Wrestling Federation, in August 1973, Wisniski beat Jacques Rougeau, Sr. to win the North American Heavyweight Championship. He lost it to Johnny Powers in late 1973.&lt;ref name=obsessedwithwrestling /&gt;

In [[Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]], Wisniski was awarded the Mid Atlantic Heavyweight Championship in January 1974, after [[Jerry Brisco]] left to work in [[Japan]]. [[Bearcat Wright]] defeated Wisniski in a boxing match to win the title on May 13, 1974. He won the championship from Sonny King on November 4, and won the United States Heavyweight Championship on July 4, 1975.&lt;ref name=obsessedwithwrestling /&gt;

After Wisniski was paralyzed in a plane crash, he remained active in professional wrestling as a [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] in [[Paul Boesch]]'s Texas-based promotion. From his wheelchair, Wisniski managed [[Dale Hey]], who competed as Dale Valentine in a storyline that saw the two promoted as brothers. The storyline did not last long, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=124|first=Dave|last=Meltzer|title=Tributes II: Remembering More of the World's Greatest Professional Wrestlers|year=2004|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|isbn=1-58261-817-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Wisniski was originally from [[Maple Valley, Washington]].&lt;ref name=slamobit/&gt; He is said to have come from a dysfunctional family. He was a devout Christian for many years.&lt;ref name=slamfightforlife&gt;{{cite web|last=Molinaro|first=John F.|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBiosV/valentine_00dec21-can.html|title=Johnny Valentine's fight for life|accessdate=2009-03-22|date=2000-12-21|work=Slam! Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was married in the early 1950s and the marriage lasted 20 years until they divorced. He was later married to a woman named Sharon, who worked across the street from his apartment in the mid 1970s when they met. She later visited John as he was recovering in hospital from his 1975 plane crash. Some time later the relationship ended as he didn't want her to see him in his condition. Years later while on braces and crutches he managed to drive around her neighbourhood for hours until he found her house. As he slowly walked to the front door Sharon`s daughter announced to Sharon that Johnny Valentine was in front of their home. Sharon having been ill refused to go to the door and hid. Wisniski insisted he wouldn't leave until he saw her. When she finally came to the door he asked her to marry him and she accepted. Following John`s death, Sharon planned to write a book titled ''A Never Ending Love Story of a Wrestler and His Wife'' about their life together.&lt;ref name=sharon&gt;{{cite web|title=Sharon Valentine talks about her love for Johnny Valentine|publisher=SLAM!

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his many injuries he slipped into a coma. At one point he came out of it while his wife was singing to him. He began singing himself but fell back into the coma. His wife had purchased medical insurance through a [[health maintenance organization]] (HMO), but the organization was unwilling to pay for Wisniski's extended stay in the hospital.&lt;ref name=slamfightforlife/&gt; As a result, [[Lou Thesz]]'s wife convinced the [[Cauliflower Alley Club]] to help contribute to Wisniski's medical bills. Those medical bills reached close to a million dollars.

Valentine has been recognized for his wrestling career by several sources. Shortly after his death, he was named the 2001 recipient of ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]'''s [[PWI Stanley Weston Award|Stanley Weston Award]], a recognition given for lifetime achievement in professional wrestling.

&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: Items on this list must be notable, and [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not for things made up one day|not terms that you made up]] or are known to only a small group. --&gt;
This is a '''list of [[Acronym and initialism|acronym]]s, expressions''', [[euphemism]]s, [[jargon]], [[military slang]], and sayings in ''common'' or ''formerly common use'' in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. Many of the words or phrases have varying levels of acceptance among different units or communities, and some also have varying levels of [[:Wikt:appropriate|appropriateness]] (usually dependent on how senior the user is in rank). Many terms also have equivalents among other service branches that are not acceptable among Marines, but are comparable in meaning. Many acronyms and terms have come into common use from [[voice procedure]] use over communication channels, translated into the [[ICAO spelling alphabet|phonetic alphabet]], or both. Many are or derive from [[Glossary of nautical terms|nautical terms]] and other [[List of U.S. Navy acronyms|naval terminology]]. Most [[List of vehicles of the United States Marine Corps|vehicles and aircraft]] have a formal acronym or an informal nickname; those are detailed in their own articles.

The scope of this list is to include words and phrases that are unique to or predominantly used by the Marine Corps or the United States Naval Service. Recent joint operations have allowed terms from other military services to leak into the USMC lexicon, but can be found with their originating service's slang list, see [[#See also|the "See also" section]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1709">'''Louis-Pierre d'Hozier''' (1685 – 25 September 1767), son of [[Louis Roger d'Hozier]], succeeded his uncle [[Charles-René d'Hozier|Charles]] as ''juge d'armes''.

He published the ''Armorial général, ou registre de la noblesse de France'' (10 vols, 1738 – 1768), which must not be confounded with the publication written by his uncle, inasmuch as it related solely to noble families and was not an official collection.

Complete copies of this work, which should contain six ''registres'', are comparatively rare. A seventh ''registre'', forming vol. xi, prepared by [[Ambroise-Louis-Marie d'Hozier|Ambroise-Louis-Marie]], nephew of Louis Pierre, was published in 1847 by comte Charles d'Hozier. Louis Pierre died on 25 September 1767.

His eldest son, '''Antoine Marie d'Hozier de Sérigny''' (1721 – c. 1810), was his father's collaborator and continuator; and his fourth son, '''Jean-François Louis''', wrote an account of the [[Knights of St Michael]] in the province of [[Poitou]], which was published in 1896 by the vicomte P de Chabot.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6539">'''Milton Halberstadt''' (1919–2000) had an illustrious career in fine art and commercial photography that spanned seven decades and left a body of work covering genres from abstract art to commercial photography.

Halberstadt studied at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and the New Bauhaus founded in 1937 by designer-painter [[László Moholy-Nagy]] and the concepts from the original [[Bauhaus]] in Germany.  He served as an assistant to both László Moholy-Nagy and [[György Kepes]].

He served as a [[United States Army Air Forces|US Army Air Forces]] navigator during [[World War II]] in the [[456th Bombardment Group]]. He was a navigator aboard a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberator]] flying over Yugoslavia in 1944 when his aircraft was hit by enemy fire. Despite severe injuries, Halberstadt guided the plane down safely and he received the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] medal for heroism in aerial combat.

'''M. Halberstadt Illustration''' studio in San Francisco was known for fine [[large format]] studio photography and he changed how food was photographed and used in print. Halberstadt was a colleague and contemporary of [[Ansel Adams]], [[Minor White]], Imogen Cunningham, Dorothea Lange, [[Edward Weston]], and other fine art photographers working in California in the area of Fine Art and Commercial Photography. He was a leader in San Francisco's golden age of advertising design. Clients included Del Monte, Dole, S&amp;W, Paul Masson, Pan-Am Airlines, and Royal Viking Lines.

Many of his students have gone on to illustrious careers in fine art photography, including his last assistant, Alan Ross, who went on to work with Ansel Adams before becoming a leader in Art Photography in his own right.

The Milton "Hal" Halberstadt Papers and Photograph Collection resides at UC Davis special collections archives.

'''''Nordisk familjebok''''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈnuːɖɪsk fa²mɪlːjɛˌbuːk|lang}}, "Nordic Family Book") is a [[Swedish language|Swedish]] [[encyclopedia]] that was published in print form between 1876 and 1957, and that is now fully available in digital form via [[Project Runeberg]] at [[Linköping University]].

== History ==
===Print editions===
[[File:nf1ed.svg|thumb|left|First edition (1876-1899), featuring [[Idun]] logo.]]
[[File:nfugglan.svg|thumb|The Owl Edition (1904-1926), featuring its namesake as its logo.]]
The first edition of ''Nordisk familjebok'' was published in 20 volumes between 1876 and 1899, and is known as the "Idun edition" because it bears a picture of [[Idun]], the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythologic]] goddess of spring and rejuvenation, on its cover.&lt;ref name="runeberg.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/nf/#preface|title=Nordisk familjebok|date=30 December 1876|website=Runeberg.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http://runeberg.org/katalog.html"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/katalog.html|title=Alphabetic catalog by title|website=Runeberg.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was published during almost a quarter of a century, and particularly the first ten volumes contain material which are not seen in later editions. A good example of this is found in the end of the [[Berlin]] article (which is included in the second volume, from 1878&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/nf/#band|title=Nordisk familjebok|date=30 December 1876|website=Runeberg.org|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), where the author finishes his article by talking about the public decency and morality, which he finds to be very poor. The author continues by complaining about there being a very lazy interest in religious matters and concludes: "to all these joint circumstances, one can hardly defend oneself against the thought of future threatening dangers".&lt;ref&gt;Last 8-9 lines in the right column (322) Just before article on "'''Berlin''', Nils Johan" http://runeberg.org/nfab/0169.html ("Berlin" or "Bärlin" is a Swedish family name)&lt;/ref&gt;

The second edition, popularly known as ''Uggleupplagan'' ("The [[Owl]] Edition") because of an owl image on its cover, was published between 1904 and 1926 in 38 volumes, and is the most comprehensive encyclopedia published in the Swedish language.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The third edition had 17 volumes and was published between 1924 and 1937. Another three supplementary volumes were published in 1937, 1938 and in 1939. The supplement covers for instance the [[Spanish Civil War]] and a heavy update on [[Adolf Hitler]], but nothing about [[German invasion of Poland|Germany's war on Poland]] nor are [[World War II|later events mentioned]]. A second printing of the entire third edition was published between 1941 and 1944. Nothing essential is changed in the second printing, but quite a lot of one side portraits (still in black and white), coloured maps of "World cities", European countries, continents, Swedish provinces and cities are added together with a few topics, like a collection of national flags. All the added material are on unnumbered pages, presumably a technical printing solution (so already printed books did not require re-numbering). This edition is usually called "the 1930s edition" and are of brown colour when looking at them on a shelf.

[[Copyrights]] on the three first versions have expired, putting them in the [[public domain]];{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} while the fourth edition, from the 1950s, is still in copyright.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Description==
The foreword notes: ''The Congressional Directory'' is one of the oldest working handbooks within the United States Government. While there were unofficial directories for Congress in one form or another beginning with the 1st Congress in 1789, the ''Congressional Directory'' published in 1847 for the 30th Congress is considered by scholars and historians to be the first official edition because it was the first to be ordered and paid for by Congress. With the addition of biographical sketches of legislators in 1867, the ''Congressional Directory'' attained its modern format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CDIR&amp;browsePath=112&amp;isCollapsed=false&amp;leafLevelBrowse=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each bi-annual edition includes:

* Short biographies of each member of the Senate and House, listed by state or district.
* Committee memberships, terms of service, administrative assistants and/or secretaries, and room and telephone numbers for Members of Congress.
* Lists officials of the courts, military establishments, and other Federal departments and agencies, including D.C. government officials, governors of states and territories, foreign diplomats, and members of the press, radio, and television galleries.

'''''Parastaseis syntomoi chronikai''''' ({{lang-el|Παραστάσεις σύντομοι χρονικαί}}, "brief historical notes") is an eighth- to ninth-century&lt;ref&gt;The date is a matter of discussion: its editors Averil Cameron and Judith Herrin argued for an early eighth-century date; A. Kazhdan, reviewing their edition in ''[[Byzantinische Zeitschrift]]'' '''80''' (1987:400-03), argued for a late eighth or early ninth-century date.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Byzantine]] text&lt;ref&gt;Its modern edition, with text and translation, is Averil Cameron and Judith Herrin, eds.  ''Constantinople in the Early Eighth Century: the Parastaseis syntomoi chronikai'', series Columbia Studies in the Classical Tradition (Leiden, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; that concentrates on brief commentary connected to the [[topography]] of [[Constantinople]] and its monuments, notably its [[Classical Greek sculpture]], for which it has been mined by [[Art history|art historian]]s, in spite of its crabbed and elliptical [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]], full of [[solecism]]s, which has made interpretation ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Even the sources given in the text prove elusive.&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is virtually the only secular text from the Byzantine age of eclipse that preceded the [[Macedonian Renaissance]], surviving in a single manuscript, its modern commentators have not esteemed it highly: Alan Cameron&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, ''Porphyrius the Charioteer'' (Oxford University Press) 1973:110.&lt;/ref&gt; found it "so stuffed with such staggering absurdities and confusions (especially where Constantine is concerned) that it is seldom worth even attempting to explain them, much less sift out the few grains of historical fact behind them." A reviewer of its modern edition even called it "the Byzantinist's ''[[Historia Augusta]]''".&lt;ref&gt;Barry Baldwin, in a positive review in ''Speculum'', '''61'''.2 (April 1986:388).&lt;/ref&gt; Classicists have been frustrated in not being able securely to identify in ''Parastaseis'' the great sculptures of Antiquity that had been removed to Constantinople by [[Constantine the Great]] and his successors, and which continued to represent continuity with the classical tradition by their prominent presence in Constantinople's public spaces.

Fire and damage took their toll, but enough remained to form the subject of [[Nicetas Choniates]]'s little pamphlet ''On the Statues destroyed by the Latins'',&lt;ref&gt;Possible alterations by a later writer have complicated the study of this text.&lt;/ref&gt; in which Nicetas described the destruction of the remaining statues by the [[Frankokratia|Latin]] [[Fourth Crusade|crusaders]] at the [[siege of Constantinople (1204)|sack of Constantinople in 1204]].&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Mango, "Antique statuary and the Byzantine beholder", ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' '''17''' (1963:55-59).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Parastaseis'', dedicated to a doubtless imaginary "''Philokalos''", the generic "lover of beauty", are generally interpreted on the simplest level as a kind of tourist's guide to the curiosities of Constantinople, in the manner of the later guides to Rome, ''[[Mirabilia urbis Romae]]'' and ''[[De mirabilibus urbis Romae]]''. In Classical Greek, a description of a work of art is an ''[[ekphrasis]]'', and when considered under this rubric, or compared with the later compilation of notes on Constantinople called the [[Patria of Constantinople|''Patria'' of Constantinople]],&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Gilbert Dagron, ''Constantinople imaginaire: Etudes sur le recueil des "Patria"'', 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Parastaseis'' fail to give an objective description. Instead, the reader is offered anecdotal narratives about the statues, which had become foci for [[legend]]s and wonder-working objects themselves. "Statues were perceived on both the intellectual and popular level as animated, dangerous and [[amulet|talisman]]ic," observes Liz James.&lt;ref&gt;James,  "'Pray Not to Fall into Temptation and Be on Your Guard': Pagan Statues in Christian Constantinople" ''Gesta'' '''35'''.1 (1996:12-20) p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Few of these [[anecdote]]s were as extended as the first-person narration about a statue of "Maximian" in the theatre of the Kynegion, which fell upon the investigator's companion, killing him; the narrator, who had taken refuge in [[Hagia Sophia]], was exonerated when a certain philosopher, Johannes, found a text attributed to [[Demosthenes]], predicting that the statue was ''[[Destiny|fated]]'' to kill a prominent man. The emperor [[Philippicus]] (reigned 711–13) then had the statue buried.&lt;ref&gt;Recounted by James 1996:12.&lt;/ref&gt; Such anecdotes do not directly relate to the commonly attributed imperial motivations for displaying classical plunder, as manifestations of imperial splendor past, present and future,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]], studded with antique statues, is seen by S.G. Bassett as "a neatly crafted ensemble that described a vision of power in its past, present and future manifestations" (Bassett, "The antiquities of the Hippodrome of Constantinople", ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' '''45''' [1991:87-96]); H. Saradi-Mendelovici, "Christian attitudes to pagan monuments in Late Antiquity and their legacy in later Byzantine centuries" ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers" '''44''' (1990:47-61&lt;/ref&gt; and may be too summarily dismissed merely as examples of Christian superstition with regard to "[[idolatry|idol]]s".
 
Liz James&lt;ref&gt;James 1996:12-20.&lt;/ref&gt; reinterpreted the text as exemplifying Byzantine views of the ''[[daimon]]es'' inhabiting such three-dimensional figural representations as potential sources of power, for those Christians who understood how to harness it. The objective assessment of a work of art was immaterial: what mattered to Byzantine writers was the "meaning" for which the statue served merely as a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;Liz James and R. Webb, "'To understand ultimate things and enter secret places': Ekphrasis and art in Byzantium", ''Art History'' '''14''' (1991:1-17).&lt;/ref&gt; With no sense of "[[ancient history|Antiquity]]", the Byzantines did not distance themselves or their art from their East Roman forebears, and had no sense that their interpretations of subject matter, often given Christian reidentifications, or the artistic style in which these representations were dressed, had drifted; by contrast, "we notice the distance that separates the Byzantines from the original meaning of pagan statues", given new identities as Christian figures or Emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Saradi-Mendelovici 1990:58.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Benjamin Anderson has argued that the ''Parastaseis'' represents an attempt by a group of a self-styled aristocrats to claim the statues as repositories of secret knowledge about the future of the empire, and thus to gain leverage in their dealings with the eighth-century emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Anderson, "Classified knowledge: the epistemology of statuary in the ''Parastaseis Syntomoi Chronikai''", ''Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies'' '''35''' (2011:1-19).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Skalich''' (1534–1573), also known as '''Stanislav Pavao Skalić''' or '''Paulus Scalichius de [[Lika]]''', was a  [[encyclopedist]], [[Renaissance humanist]], and adventurer born in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]], and who lived part of his life in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="darko"&gt;[http://www.hr/darko/etf/lat.html#skal ''Croatian Humanists, Ecumenists, Latinists, and Encyclopaedists''] (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; His surname is rendered in various other ways: e.g., in [[English language|English]], ''Skalich, Scalich, Scaliger;'' in [[Latin language|Latin]], ''Scalichius'' or ''Scaligius;'' and in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''Scalitzius''.

Skalić studied [[theology]] and [[philosophy]] in [[Vienna]] and later moved around Europe, living in [[Bologna]], [[Rome]], [[Bohemia]], [[Poland]], [[France]] and Germany, among other places.&lt;ref&gt;Lovro Županović. "Skalić, Pavao." ''New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians''&lt;/ref&gt;

His book ''[[Encyclopediae_seu_orbis_disciplinarum_tam_sacrarum_quam_profanarum_epistemon|Encyclopaedia seu orbis disciplinarum tam sacrarum quam prophanarum epistemon]]'' ("Encyclopaedia, or Knowledge of the World of Disciplines"; [[Basel]], 1559) is one of the first books entitled ''[[encyclopedia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Yeo | first = Richard | title = Encyclopaedic visions : scientific dictionaries and enlightenment culture | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0521152921 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Collison later wrote that the work was poorly written, only being important today for its use of the word ''encyclopaedia,'' and that Joachim Sterck van Ringelbergh had used the word ''cyclopaedia'' to describe his work in 1541.&lt;ref&gt;Collison, Robert. ''Encyclopaedias''. 2nd ed. (Hafner, 1966) p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Skalić also wrote a treatise on music: ''Dialogus de Lyra'' ([[Cologne]], 1570).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;!--the next one very probably was 'Johann Heinrich Alsted's' (1630). --&gt;
He and preacher [[Johann Funck]] exercised great influence over [[Albert of Prussia|Albert]] (1490-1568), first duke of [[Prussia]], and became wealthy. Religious differences with the king of [[Poland]] led to the execution of Funck and the rise of Skalić.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/newschaffherzog13haucgoog#page/n424/mode/2up ''Schaff-Herzog'' article]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nationality ==
References vary regarding Skalić's nationality. M. Girardi-Karšulin at the [[University of Zagreb]] claims that he was Croatian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mzos.hr/svibor/6/01/334/proj_e.htm ''Basic philosophical problems in Pavao Skaliæ's work''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040905034142/http://www.mzos.hr/svibor/6/01/334/proj_e.htm |date=2004-09-05 }} (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; as does Darko Žubrinić.&lt;ref name="darko" /&gt; But many modern English encyclopedias, such as ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106030 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' "encyclopaedia"]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia]]'', and ''[[Encarta]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761551647/Encyclopedia.html ''Encarta'' "Encyclopedia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427071114/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761551647/Encyclopedia.html |date=2006-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicate that he was German. This could be because he lived at the time when [[Lika]] and the rest of Croatia was part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], although, as stated above, he spent a major part of his life in Germany.

Older works such as the Spanish [[Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeo-americana|''Enciclopedia universal ilustrada europeoamericana'' (''Espasa'')]] (vol. 19, (1930) page 1166) say that he is an [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] count (''"y esta voz, ya latinizada, se emplea en el rótulo de la obra del conde húngaro Scalitzus",'' "and this term, Latinized, is used in the heading of the work of the Hungarian count Scalitzius".){{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] (1910–1911) on page 169 says the same, referring to him as "Paulus Scalichius de Lika, an Hungarian count".&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=User:Tim_Starling/ScanSet_TIFF_demo&amp;vol=09&amp;page=EB9A392 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 1911 scan]&lt;/ref&gt;

Known by many names, or [[avatar]]s, Pomba Gira is often associated with the number seven, [[crossroads (junction)|crossroads]], [[graveyard]]s, [[spirit possession]], and [[witchcraft]].

==Tradition==
While [[Eshu|Exu]] represents [[male sexuality]], fertility and strength, Pomba Gira personifies [[female sexuality]], beauty and desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Gendering global transformations: gender, culture, race, and identity | editor = Chima Jacob Korieh | last = Hayes | first = Kelly E. | chapter = The Dark Side of the Feminine: Pomba Gira Spirits in Brazil | pages = 119–132 | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis US | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-415-96325-1 | series = Routledge Research in Gender and Society | volume = 16 | quote = Indeed, her profile is familiar to any inhabitant of the Western world, for Pomba Gira is the archetypal ''femme fatale'', that seductive yet perilous siren depicted in pulp fiction and ''film noir''.

Pomba Gira is venerated with great respect and care because of her reputation for possessing great wrath. She is often invoked by those who seek aid in matters of the heart and love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Conversion of a continent: contemporary religious change in Latin America | last = Chestnut | first = Andrew |editor1-last = Steigenga | editor1-first = Timothy J.| editor2-last = Cleary | editor2-first = Edward L. | publisher = Rutgers University Press | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-8135-4202-7 | page = 87 | chapter = Latin America's Free Market of Faith  |quote = A married woman, for example, who suspects an acquaintance of having an affair with her husband might ask Pomba Gira to harm the other woman so that she is no longer the object of her husband's affection. | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_mG5uSFgNgUC&amp;pg=PA87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pomba Gira is noted for her connection with both transgender women and [[effeminate]] male worshippers and is reputed to [[spirit possession|possess]] both.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Kelly E. 2008.

[[File:ZOFIA KOSSAK.jpg|thumb|[[Zofia Kossak-Szczucka]], author of ''Protest''; Polish writer and Catholic social activist; head of [[Front for the Rebirth of Poland]]]]
'''Kossak-Szczucka's ''Protest''''' was an official protest by [[Catholic Church in Poland|Polish Catholics]] against the mass murder of Jews in [[German-occupied Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Wroński (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engel (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
''Protest!'' was published on 28 August 1942 in Warsaw. It was signed by the Polish underground organization, [[Front for the Rebirth of Poland]], which was a continuation of the prewar [[Catholic Action]]. Its president at the time was the Polish writer, [[Zofia Kossak-Szczucka]]. ''Protest!'' was  clandestinely issued as a leaflet in 5,000 copies in [[Warsaw]] on 11 August 1942. It was published a few weeks after the start of the Germans'  liquidation of the [[Warsaw ghetto]], from which – as part of [[Operation Reinhard]] – Jews were deported to the [[Treblinka extermination camp]].&lt;ref&gt;Wroński (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engel (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

The world, Kossak-Szczucka wrote, was silent in the face of this atrocity. "England is silent, so is America, even the influential international Jewry, so sensitive in its reaction to any transgression against its people, is silent. Poland is silent... Dying Jews are surrounded only by a host of [[Pontius Pilate|Pilates]] washing their hands in innocence." Those who are silent in the face of murder, she wrote, become accomplices to the crime. Kossak-Szczucka saw this largely as an issue of religious ethics. "Our feelings toward Jews have not changed," she wrote. "We do not stop thinking of them as political, economic and ideological enemies of Poland." But, she wrote, this does not relieve Polish Catholics of their duty to oppose the crimes being committed in their country.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We are required by God to protest," she wrote. "God who forbids us to kill. We are required by our Christian consciousness. Every human being has the right to be loved by his fellow men. The blood of the defenceless cries to heaven for revenge. Those who oppose our protest, are not Catholics.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We do not believe that Poland can benefit from German cruelties. On the contrary. ... We know how poisoned is the fruit of the crime. ... Those who do not understand this, and believe that a proud and free future for Poland can be combined with acceptance of the grief of their fellow men, are neither Catholics nor Poles.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==
The protest was a big surprise for [[Left-wing politics|leftist circles]] and the Jews themselves, because Zofia Kossak was associated with Catholic [[Nationalism|national circles]], which in the [[Second Polish Republic|pre-war Poland]] were very reserved for Jews and criticized Jewish communities. This position was also clearly presented by the author in the content of her protest. After announcing her appeal, Kossak repeatedly published in the underground press appeals to Poles for help to the Jews. Her efforts led in September 1942 to establishing an organization helping Jews, the [[Provisional Committee to Aid Jews]] (''Tymczasowy Komitet Pomocy Żydom''), later transformed into the Council to Aid Jews (''Rada Pomocy Żydom'') - [[Żegota]], an underground organization whose sole purpose was to save Jews in Poland from Nazi extermination. It was the only organization of this type in occupied Europe. Co-organizer was [[Wanda Krahelska]], social activist of the [[Polish Socialist Party]]&lt;ref&gt;Wroński (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engel (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;.

Kossak personally helped the Jews hiding on the "Aryan side" by supplying them with money and false documents. In 1943 she was arrested by the Germans and imprisoned in the German concentration camp [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]], and later transferred to [[Pawiak|Pawiak prison]], where she was sentenced to death. It was saved in 1944 thanks to the efforts of the [[Polish Underground State|Polish underground]]. For her contribution to saving Jews during World War II, she received posthumously in 1982 a medal and the title of [[Righteous Among the Nations]] by [[Yad Vashem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://db.yadvashem.org/righteous/righteousName.html?language=en&amp;itemId=4015763 |title=The Righteous Among The Nations: Szczucka Zofia (1989 - 1968) |accessdate=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Kossak-Szczucka's "Protest", Robert D. Cherry and Annamaria Orla-Bukowska&lt;ref name="Rethinking"&gt;Robert Cherry, Annamaria Orla-Bukowska, ''Rethinking Poles and Jews: Troubled Past, Brighter Future'', pg. 5. [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], 2007; {{ISBN|0-7425-4666-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in the introduction to ''Rethinking Poles and Jews'': "Without at all whitewashing her antisemitism in the document, she vehemently called for active intercession on behalf of the Jews - precisely in the name of Polish Roman Catholicism and Polish patriotism. The deportations from the Warsaw Ghetto precipitated her cofounding of [[Żegota]] that same year - an [[Armia Krajowa]] (AK, Home Army) unit whose sole purpose was to save Jews."

The '''School of the Art Institute of Chicago''' ('''SAIC''') is one of America's largest accredited independent schools of art and design. It is located in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. The school is associated with [[The Art Institute of Chicago|the museum of the same name]], and "The Art Institute of Chicago" or "Chicago Art Institute" often refers to either entity. Providing degrees at the undergraduate and graduate levels, SAIC has been recognized by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' as one of the top graduate art programs in the nation, as well as by [[Columbia University]]'s National Arts Journalism survey as the most influential art school in the United States.

[[File:School of the Art Institute Chicago Grant Park.JPG|thumb|300px|The school's [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]], Columbus Avenue, building, attached to the museum, houses a premier gallery showcase.]]

Tracing its history to an art students' cooperative founded in 1866, which grew into the museum and school, SAIC has been accredited since 1936 by the [[Higher Learning Commission]], by the [[National Association of Schools of Art and Design]] since 1944 (charter member), and by the [[Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design]] (AICAD) since its founding in 1991. Additionally it is accredited by the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]].

Its downtown Chicago campus consists of seven buildings located in the immediate vicinity of the [[Art Institute of Chicago Building|AIC building]]. SAIC is in an equal partnership with the AIC and share many administrative resources such as design, construction, and human resources. The campus, located in [[Chicago Loop|the Loop]], comprises chiefly three buildings: the Michigan (112 S. Michigan Ave.), the Sharp (37 S. Wabash Ave.), and the Columbus (280 S. Columbus Dr.). SAIC also owns additional buildings throughout Chicago that are used as student galleries or investments.

== History ==
The institute has its roots in the 1866 founding of the '''Chicago Academy of Design''', which local artists established in rented rooms on Clark Street.  It was financed by member dues and patron donations. Four years later, the school moved into its own Adams Street building, which was destroyed in the [[Great Chicago Fire of 1871]].

Because of the school's financial and managerial problems after this loss, business leaders in 1878 formed a [[Board of directors|board of trustees]] and founded the '''Chicago Academy of Fine Arts'''.  They expanded its mission beyond education and exhibitions to include collecting. In 1882, the academy was renamed the '''Art Institute of Chicago'''.  The banker [[Charles L. Hutchinson]] served as its elected president until his death in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Diane. [http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/79.html "Art Institute of Chicago"], ''Encyclopedia of Chicago''&lt;/ref&gt;

Chancellor [[Walter E. Massey]] served as president from 2010–July 2016. The current president is [[Elissa Tenny]], formerly the school's provost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saic.edu/press/saic-names-elissa-tenny-president-succeed-walter-massey-effective-july-1-2016|title=SAIC Names Elissa Tenny President to Succeed Walter Massey, Effective July 1, 2016|author=|date=|website=saic.edu|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

===Visiting Artists Program===
Founded in 1868, the '''Visiting Artists Program (VAP)''' is one of the oldest public programs of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Formalized in 1951 by Flora Mayer Witkowsky's endowment of a supporting fund, the Visiting Artists Program hosts public presentations by artists, designers, and scholars each year in lectures, symposia, performances, and screenings. It is an eclectic program that showcases artists' working in all media, including sound, video, performance, poetry, painting, and independent film; in addition to significant curators, critics, and art historians.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Recent visiting artists have included [[Catherine Opie]], [[Andi Zeisler]], [[Aaron Koblin]], [[Jean Shin]], [[Sam Lipsyte]], [[Ben Marcus]], [[Marilyn Minter]], [[Pearl Fryar]], [[Tehching Hsieh]], [[Homi K. Bhabha]], [[Bill Fontana]], [[Wolfgang Laib]], [[Suzanne Lee]], and [[Amar Kanwar]] among others.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Additionally, the Distinguished Alumni Series brings alumni back to the community to present their work and reflect on how their experiences at SAIC have shaped them. Recent alumni speakers include [[Tania Bruguera]], Jenni Sorkin, Kori Newkirk, [[Maria Martinez-Cañas]], [[Saya Woolfalk]], [[Jun Nguyen-Hatsushiba]], and [[Sanford Biggers]] to name a few.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

===Galleries===
*'''Sullivan Galleries'''- Located to the 7th floor of the Sullivan Center at 33 S. State Street. With shows and projects often led by faculty or student curators, it is a teaching gallery that engages the exhibition process as a pedagogical model and mode of research.
*'''SITE Galleries (formerly Student Union Galleries)''' - Founded in 1994, SITE, once known as the Student Union Galleries (SUGs), is a ''student-run'' organization at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) for the exhibition of ''student work''. The two central tenets of the galleries are to build relationships between different departments and stakeholders throughout the institution and strengthen our role as a teaching gallery within and beyond SAIC. This is accomplished first through providing a consistent space for undergraduate and graduate directors to organize and generate exhibitions that realize the vision of student artists. Furthermore, with strategic programming, SITE supports these exhibitions and engages evolving currents and discourses in our communities. The student-led structure provides opportunities for emerging artists and scholars to explore artistic and administrative methods by placing emphasis on collaborative processes and professional practice in and out of the classroom. They have two locations: The SITE Sharp of the 37 South Wabash Avenue building; and SITE Columbus of the 280 South Columbus Drive building. The two locations allow the galleries to cycle two shows simultaneously.  

===Student organizations===

==== ExTV ====
ExTV is a student-run time-arts platform that broadcasts online and on campus. Its broadcasts are available via monitors located throughout the 112 S. Michigan building, the 37 S Wabash building, and the 280 S. Columbus building. It is available on campus and off campus at extvsaic.org and on cantv.

====''F Newsmagazine''====
''F Newsmagazine'' is a student-run newspaper with both paid and volunteer positions. The magazine is a monthly publication with a run of 12,000 copies. Copies are distributed throughout the city, mainly at locations frequented by students such as popular diners and movie theaters.

====Free Radio SAIC====
Free Radio SAIC is the student-run Internet radio station of The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Free Radio uses an open programming format and encourage its DJs to explore and experiment with the medium of live radio. Program content and style vary but generally include music from all genres, sound art, narratives, live performances, current events and interviews. [http://freeradiosaic.org]

Featured bands and guests on Free Radio SAIC include [[Nü Sensae]], [[The Black Belles]], Thomas Comerford, [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], [[Jeff Bennett]], [[Carolyn Lawrence]], and much more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freeradiosaic.org/shows/babewave/ |title=Babe Wave – freeradiosaic |publisher=Freeradiosaic.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117112519/http://freeradiosaic.org/shows/babewave/ |archivedate=2014-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tarun on August 22, 2011 |url=http://freeradiosaic.org/shows/cartoons-on-the-radio/ |title=Cartoons On The Radio – freeradiosaic |publisher=Freeradiosaic.org |date=2011-08-22 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=andy on November 1, 2011 |url=http://freeradiosaic.org/shows/interviews-with-people/ |title=Interview With Thomas Comerford – freeradiosaic |publisher=Freeradiosaic.org |date=2011-11-01 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Student government====
The student government of SAIC is unique in that its constitution resembles a socialist republic, in which four officers hold equal power and responsibility. Elections are held every year. There are no campaign requirements. Any group of four students may run for office, but there must always be four students.

The student government is responsible for hosting a school-wide student meeting once a month. At these meetings students discuss school concerns of any nature. The predominant topic is funding for the various student organizations. Organizations which desire funding must present a proposal at the meeting by which the students vote whether they should receive monies or not. The student government cannot participate in the vote: only oversee it.

The student government is also responsible for the distribution of the Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Fund, Welcome Back to School Party, Monthly Morning Coffees, Open Forums, Barbecues in the Pit (the outdoor area at the entrance of the 280 S Columbus Building), Holiday Art Sale, and a Materials Event. In the past Student Government has accomplished such things as campus-wide recycling, and access to the [[Chicago Transit Authority]]'s [[Universal Transit Pass|U-Pass]].

== Ranking ==
In a survey conducted by the National Arts Journalism Program at Columbia University, SAIC was named the “most influential art school” by art critics at general interest news publications from across the United States.&lt;ref name="Columbia_2002"&gt;{{cite web | title = The Visual Art Critic | url =http://www.najp.org/publications/researchreports/tvac.pdf | publisher = Columbia University National Arts Journalism Program | accessdate = 2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-fine-arts-schools/fine-arts-rankings|title=2017 Best Graduate Fine Arts Programs|last=|first=|date=|work=U.S. News and World Report|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314175250/https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-fine-arts-schools/fine-arts-rankings|archive-date=2017-03-14|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;, US News ranked SAIC the fourth best overall graduate program for fine arts in the U.S. tying with the Rhode Island school of Design.

== Controversy ==

=== ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' ===
{{Main|Mirth &amp; Girth}}
On May 11,&amp;nbsp;1988, a student painting depicting [[Harold Washington]], the first black mayor of Chicago, was torn down by some of the city's African-American [[Chicago City Council|aldermen]] — over the protests of many who attempted to block them — based on its content. The painting, titled ''Mirth &amp; Girth'' by David Nelson, was of Washington clad only in women's underwear holding a pencil.&lt;ref name="sneed_19880704"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB36DE58EA8BDAC&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |author=Sneed, Michael |title=Untitled |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |date=1988-07-04 |accessdate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington died on November 25,&amp;nbsp;1987.

The painting was returned after a day, and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against the Chicago Police Department and the aldermen. The ACLU claimed the removal violated Nelson's First, Fourth, and Fourteenth amendment rights.  Nelson ended up receiving a monetary settlement for damage to the painting which occurred during its confiscation.&lt;ref name="Dubin 1992"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dubin | first = Steven | title = Arresting Images, Impolitic Art and Uncivil Actions | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-415-90893-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''What Is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?'' ===

In February&amp;nbsp;1989, a student named "Dread" Scott Tyler draped the [[Flag of the United States]] across the floor&lt;!-- United States Flag Code --&gt; for a piece titled ''What Is the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?'' The piece consisted of a podium with a notebook for viewers to express how they felt about the exhibit. However, the podium was set upon a flag laid on the floor. In order for viewers to write in the notebook, they would have to walk on the flag. Viewers were occasionally arrested at the request of veterans.&lt;ref name="Dubin 1992"/&gt; The school stood by the student's art in the face of protests and threats. That year, the school's federal funding was cut from $70,000 to $1 and many benefactors pulled donations.{{citation needed|date = February 2013}}

===Academic Freedom controversy===
In 2017, a controversy arose over the resignation of [[Michael Bonesteel]], an [[Professors_in_the_United_States#Adjunct_professor|adjunct professor]] specializing in outsider art and comics after two Title IX complaints were filed. Bonesteel described the SAIC investigation as a "Kafkaesque trial" in which he was never shown copies of the complaints and in which he was guilty until proven innocent and that SAIC "feels more like a police state than a place where academic freedom and the open exchange of ideas is valued".&lt;ref name=TensionsintheArtClassroom&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/07/24/debate-over-art-teaching-and-prejudice-school-art-institute-chicago |title=Tensions in the Art Classroom |last=Roll |first=Nick |date=July  24, 2017 |website=Inside Higher Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laura Kipnis]], author of [[Unwanted Advances: Sexual Paranoia Comes to Campus|a book]] on Title IX cases, described SAIC as displaying "jawdropping cowardice" and said "The idea that students are trying to censor or curb a professor’s opinions or thinking is appalling".  &lt;ref&gt;Jori Finkel, "Art school under fire for bowing to transgender student complaints", ''The Art Newspaper'', 18 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Bartlett, "The Offender", ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', August 10, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  The School said the claims made against it were "problematic" and "misleading" and said it supports [[academic freedom]].&lt;ref name="TensionsintheArtClassroom" /&gt;

The '''Shand House Museum''' is part of the [[Nova Scotia Museum]].  Located in [[Windsor, Nova Scotia]], it was built in 1890-91 for Clifford and Henrie Shand.  It is a [[Queen Anne Revival architecture|Queen Anne Revival]] style late-Victorian Era home, and most of its elaborate machine-made trim features are still intact.  It contains most of the original family's belongings, including furniture, dishes, artwork, toys, photos and books which date to the turn of the century.  Many pieces of the home's furniture were made at the nearby Windsor Furniture Factory, which was in operation in the late 19th and early 20th century Windsor.  Unusually for its time, the home was constructed with an indoor plumbing, central heating, and was wired for electric lighting within a year of its completion.

Clifford Shand was a local businessman and early bicycle enthusiast (part of the [[Bicycle craze#1890s|bicycle craze of the 1890s]]).  His father, Andrew P. Shand, was part-owner in the Windsor Furniture Factory, and craftsmen from the factory made not only much of the furniture, but most of the elaborate trim that still decorates the inside of the house.  Throughout the home there are many photos and trophies attesting to Clifford's bicycling exploits, as well as many paintings done by his wife, Henrie.

Only four people ever lived in the home: Clifford and Henrie, and their two children, Errol B. Shand and Gwendolyn V. Shand.  The house was donated to the Nova Scotia Museum by their daughter Gwendolyn, who lived in the house (though not continuously) until her death in 1982.  The home was opened as a Museum in 1985.

While the family were noted local figures, the house is primarily maintained not as a memorial to the Shand family, but as a very well preserved example of the architectural, economic, and social history of 1890s Nova Scotia.

The museum is currently open from June 1 to October 15 every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/sh/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228200636/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/sh/ |archivedate=December 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Signum manus''''' (sometimes also known as ''Chrismon'') refers to the medieval practice, current from the [[Merovingian period]] until the 14th century in the [[Frankish Empire]] and its successors, of signing a document or charter with a special type of [[monogram]] or [[royal cypher]].

The term ''Chrismon'' was introduced in [[New Latin]] specifically as a term for the [[Chi Rho]] monogram. As this symbol was used in Merovingian documents at the starting point of what would diversify into the tradition of "cross-signatures", German scholarship of the 18th century extended use of the term ''Chrismon'' to the entire field.&lt;ref&gt;[https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/MKL1888:Chrismon Chrismon] in ''Meyers Konversations-Lexikon'' 4th ed. (1888/9).&lt;/ref&gt; In medievalist [[paleography]] and ''Diplomatik'' (''ars diplomaticae'', i.e. the study of [[:wikt:diploma#Latin|documents or charters]]), the study of these signatures or sigils was known as ''Chrismologia'' or ''Chrismenlehre'', while the study of [[Christian cross variants|cross variants]] was known as ''Staurologia''.&lt;ref&gt;from ''[[stauros]]'' "stake, cross"; the same term ''Staurologia'' in a different context may also refer to the field of [[Theology of the Cross]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chrismon'' in this context may refer to the [[Merovingian period]] abbreviation ''I. C. N.'' for ''in Christi nomine'', later (in the [[Carolingian period]]) also ''I. C.'' for ''in Christo'', and still later (in the high medieval period) just ''C.'' for ''Christus''.&lt;ref&gt;  Gatterer (1798), 
[https://books.google.ch/books?id=NaRAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA64  p. 64f].&lt;/ref&gt;

A cross symbol was often drawn as an invocation at the beginning of documents in the early medieval West. 
At the end of documents, commissioners or witnesses would sign with a ''signum manus'', often also in the form of a simple cross. This practice is widespread in Merovingian documents of the 7th and 8th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Garipzanov (2008:161f)&lt;/ref&gt; A related development is the widespread use of the cross symbol on the obverse side of early medieval coins, interpreted as the ''signum manus'' of the moneyer.&lt;ref&gt;Garipzanov (2008:163f)&lt;/ref&gt;
The tradition of minting coins with the monogram of the ruling monarch on the obverse side originates in the 5th century, both in Byzantium and in Rome. This tradition was continued in the 6th century by Germanic kings, including the Merovingians. These early designs were ''box'' monograms. The first ''cruciform'' monogram was used by [[Justinian I]] in the 560s. [[Tiberius III]] used a cruciform monogram with the letters ''R, M'' for Rome and ''T, B'' for Tiberius; [[Pope Gregory III]] used the letters ''G, R, E, O''.&lt;ref&gt;Garipzanov (2008:173)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earliest surviving Merovingian royal charters, dating to the 7th century, have the box monograms of [[Chlothar II]] and [[Clovis II]].&lt;ref&gt;Garipzanov (2008:167)&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 7th century, the use of royal monograms was abandoned entirely by the Merovingian kings; instead, royal wax seals were first attached to the documents, and the kings would sign their name in full.

The ''signum manus'' in the form of a modified cross symbol first appears in charters of both Frankish Gaul and Anglo-Saxon England in the late 7th and early 8th century. [[Charlemagne]]  first used his cruciform monogram, likely inspired by the earlier papal monograms, in 769, and he would continue to use it for the rest of his reign. The monogram spells ''KAROLVS'', with the 
consonants ''K, R, L, S'' at the ends of the cross-arms, and the vowels ''A, O, V'' displayed in ligature at the center.&lt;ref&gt;Garipzanov (2008:172)&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Louis the Pious]] abandoned the cross monogram, using again a H-type or box monogram.&lt;ref&gt;Garipzanov (2008:182)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21267">In [[software development]], '''effort estimation''' is the process of predicting the most realistic amount of effort (expressed in terms of person-hours or money) required to develop or maintain [[software]] based on incomplete, uncertain and noisy input. Effort [[estimation|estimates]] may be used as input to project plans, iteration plans, budgets, investment analyses, pricing processes and bidding rounds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infoq.com/articles/software-development-effort-estimation&lt;/ref&gt;

==State-of-practice==
Published surveys on estimation practice suggest that expert estimation is the dominant strategy when estimating software development effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | author = Jørgensen, M.
  | title = A Review of Studies on Expert Estimation of Software Development Effort
  | url = http://simula.no/publications/review-studies-expert-estimation-software-development-effort
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, effort estimates are over-optimistic and there is a strong over-confidence in their accuracy. The mean effort overrun seems to be about 30% and not decreasing over time. For a review of effort estimation error surveys, see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | author = Molokken, K. Jorgensen, M.
  | title = A review of software surveys on software effort estimation
  | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1237981
   }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the measurement of estimation error is problematic, see [[#Assessing the accuracy of estimates|Assessing the accuracy of estimates]].
The strong overconfidence in the accuracy of the effort estimates is illustrated by the finding that, on average, if a software professional is 90% confident or “almost sure” to include the actual effort in a minimum-maximum interval, the observed frequency of including the actual effort is only 60-70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Currently the term “effort estimate” is used to denote as different concepts such as most likely use of effort (modal value), the effort that corresponds to a probability of 50% of not exceeding (median), the planned effort, the budgeted effort or the effort used to propose a bid or price to the client. This is believed to be unfortunate, because communication problems may occur and because the concepts serve different goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Edwards | first1 = J.S.

(1998). Enhancing judgmental sales forecasting: The role of laboratory research. Forecasting with judgment. G. Wright and P. Goodwin. New York, John Wiley &amp; Sons: 91-112. Hi&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Software researchers and practitioners have been addressing the problems of effort estimation for software development projects since at least the 1960s; see, e.g., work by Farr &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | author = Farr, L. Nanus, B.
  | title = Factors that affect the cost of computer programming, volume I
  | url = http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/603707.pdf
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | author = Farr, L. Nanus, B.
  | title = Factors that affect the cost of computer programming, volume II
  | url = http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/607546.pdf
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nelson.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, E. A. (1966). Management Handbook for the Estimation of Computer Programming Costs. AD-A648750, Systems Development Corp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the research has focused on the construction of formal software effort estimation models. The early models were typically based on [[regression analysis]] or mathematically derived from theories from other domains. Since then a high number of model building approaches have been evaluated, such as approaches founded on [[case-based reasoning]], classification and [[regression trees]], [[simulation]], [[neural networks]], [[Bayesian statistics]], [[lexical analysis]] of requirement specifications, [[genetic programming]], [[linear programming]], economic production models, [[soft computing]], [[fuzzy logic]] modeling, statistical [[bootstrapping]], and combinations of two or more of these models. The perhaps most common estimation methods today are the parametric estimation models [[COCOMO]], [[SEER-SEM]] and SLIM. They have their basis in estimation research conducted in the 1970s and 1980s and are since then updated with new calibration data, with the last major release being COCOMO II in the year 2000.  The estimation approaches based on functionality-based size measures, e.g., [[function points]], is also based on research conducted in the 1970s and 1980s, but are re-calibrated with modified size measures and different counting approaches, such as the [[Use Case Points|use case points]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[object point]]s in the 1990s and [http://www.cosmic-sizing.org COSMIC] in the 2000s.

==Estimation approaches==
There are many ways of categorizing estimation approaches, see for example.&lt;ref&gt;Briand, L. C. and Wieczorek, I. (2002). Resource estimation in software engineering. Encyclopedia of software engineering. J. J. Marcinak. New York, John Wiley &amp; Sons: 1160-1196.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | author = Jørgensen, M. Shepperd, M.
  | title = A Systematic Review of Software Development Cost Estimation Studies
  | url = http://simula.no/research/engineering/publications/Jorgensen.2007.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The top level categories are the following:

* Expert estimation: The quantification step, i.e., the step where the estimate is produced based on judgmental processes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxagile.com/services/custom-software-design-and-development/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Formal estimation model: The quantification step is based on mechanical processes, e.g., the use of a formula derived from historical data.
* Combination-based estimation: The quantification step is based on a judgmental and mechanical combination of estimates from different sources.

Below are examples of estimation approaches within each category.

==Selection of estimation approaches==
The evidence on differences in estimation accuracy of different estimation approaches and models suggest that there is no “best approach” and that the relative accuracy of one approach or model in comparison to another depends strongly on the context
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | author = Shepperd, M. Kadoda, G.
  | title = Comparing software prediction techniques using simulation
  | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/32/20846/00965341.pdf?arnumber=965341 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that different organizations benefit from different estimation approaches. Findings (summarized in,&lt;ref name="Jørgensen, M"&gt;{{cite web
  | author = Jørgensen, M.
  | title = Estimation of Software Development Work Effort:Evidence on Expert Judgment and Formal Models
  | url = http://simula.no/research/engineering/publications/Jorgensen.2007.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) that may support the selection of estimation approach based on the expected accuracy of an approach include:

* Expert estimation is on average at least as accurate as model-based effort estimation. In particular, situations with unstable relationships and information of high importance not included in the model may suggest use of expert estimation. This assumes, of course, that experts with relevant experience are available.
* Formal estimation models not tailored to a particular organization’s own context, may be very inaccurate. Use of own historical data is consequently crucial if one cannot be sure that the estimation model’s core relationships (e.g., formula parameters) are based on similar project contexts.
* Formal estimation models may be particularly useful in situations where the model is tailored to the organization’s context (either through use of own historical data or that the model is derived from similar projects and contexts), and it is likely that the experts’ estimates will be subject to a strong degree of wishful thinking.

The most robust finding, in many forecasting domains, is that combination of estimates from independent sources, preferable applying different approaches, will on average improve the estimation accuracy.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen, M"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

It is important to be aware of the limitations of each traditional approach to measuring software development productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | author = BlueOptima
  | title = Identifying Reliable, Objective Software Development Metrics
  | url = http://www.blueoptima.com/web/guest/blog/-/blogs/23436 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, other factors such as ease of understanding and communicating the results of an approach, ease of use of an approach, and cost of introduction of an approach should be considered in a selection process.

==Assessing the accuracy of estimates==
The most common measure of the average estimation accuracy is the MMRE (Mean Magnitude of Relative Error), where the MRE of each estimate is defined as:

''MRE'' = &lt;math&gt;\frac{|\text{actual effort} - \text{estimated effort}|}\text{actual effort}&lt;/math&gt;

This measure has been criticized &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

MRE is not reliable if the individual items are skewed.  PRED(25) is preferred as a measure of estimation accuracy.  PRED(25) measures the percentage of predicted values that are within 25 percent of the actual value.

A high estimation error cannot automatically be interpreted as an indicator of low estimation ability. Alternative, competing or complementing, reasons include low cost control of project, high complexity of development work, and more delivered functionality than originally estimated. A framework for improved use and interpretation of estimation error measurement is included in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Psychological issues==
There are many psychological factors potentially explaining the strong tendency towards over-optimistic effort estimates that need to be dealt with to increase accuracy of effort estimates. These factors are essential even when using formal estimation models, because much of the input to these models is judgment-based. Factors that have been demonstrated to be important are: [[Wishful thinking]], [[anchoring]], [[planning fallacy]] and [[cognitive dissonance]]. A discussion on these and other factors can be found in work by Jørgensen and Grimstad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* It's easy to estimate what you know.
* It's hard to estimate what you know you don't know. (known unknowns)
* It's very hard to estimate things that you don't know you don't know. (unknown unknowns)

==Humor==
The chronic underestimation of development effort has led to the coinage and popularity of numerous humorous adages, such as ironically referring to a task as a "[[small matter of programming]]" (when much effort is likely required), and citing laws about underestimation:

* [[Ninety-ninety rule]]:

'''St Fagans National Museum of History''' ({{lang-cy|Sain Ffagan: Amgueddfa Werin Cymru}}), commonly referred to as '''[[St Fagans]]''' after the village where it is located, is an [[open-air museum]] in [[Cardiff]] chronicling the historical lifestyle, culture, and architecture of the Welsh people. The museum is part of the wider network of [[Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cardiffians.co.uk/suburbs/stfagans.shtml|title=The history of the suburb of St. Fagans – Cardiffians.co.uk|last=Witty|first=Matthew|website=www.cardiffians.co.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of more than forty re-erected buildings from various locations in Wales, and is set in the grounds of [[St Fagans Castle]], a [[Grade I]] listed Elizabethan manor house.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/story-wales-best-loved-museum-14981627|title=The story of Wales' best-loved museum as St Fagans hits 70|last=Clements|first=Laura|date=2018-08-04|work=walesonline|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 ''[[Which?]]'' magazine named the museum the United Kingdom's favourite visitor attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= National History Museum at St Fagans soars to the top of UK's favourite tourist sites |author= Clare Hutchinson |url= http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2011/09/29/national-history-museum-at-st-fagans-soars-to-the-top-of-uk-s-favourite-tourist-sites-91466-29507382/ |newspaper= WalesOnline |date=  29 September 2011 |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A six-year, £30 million revamp was completed in 2018.

==History==

The museum was started in 1946 following the donation of the castle and lands by the [[Earl of Plymouth]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/nostalgia/welsh-history-month-st-fagans-7908390|title=Welsh History Month: St Fagans’ 100-acre site now contains more than 40 original buildings that demonstrate many aspects of Wales’ architectural history|last=Pyke|first=Chris|date=2014-10-09|work=walesonline|access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened its doors to the public in 1948, under the name of the '''Welsh Folk Museum'''. The museum's name in Welsh (also meaning "Welsh Folk Museum") has remained unchanged since that date, whereas the English title was modified to '''Museum of Welsh Life''', thereafter St Fagans National History Museum, and again to its current nomenclature.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/st-fagans-celebrates-60-years-2161447|title=St Fagans celebrates 60 years|last=WalesOnline|date=2008-06-30|work=walesonline|access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brainchild of [[Iorwerth Peate]], the museum was modelled on [[Skansen]], the outdoor museum of vernacular [[Sweden|Swedish]] architecture in [[Stockholm]]. Most structures re-erected in Skansen were built of wood and are thus easily taken apart and reassembled, but a comparable museum in Wales was going to be more ambitious, as much of the vernacular architecture of Wales is made of masonry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A redeveloped main reception building was opened in July 2017.&lt;ref name=BBCredevopens&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-40584991|title=St Fagans museum's redevelopment opens|date=2017-07-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The six-year £30m redevelopment of the site, which was funded by a number of sources, notably the [[Welsh Government]] and the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]], was completed in October 2018.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/18/st-fagans-welsh-history-museum-revamp-completed|title='Story of Wales': history museum's six-year revamp completed|last=Morris|first=Steven|date=18 October 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/first-look-inside-30m-redevelopment-15295532|title=The £30m revamp at St Fagans National Museum of History|last=Bevan|first=Nathan|date=2018-10-18|work=walesonline|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buildings and exhibits==

The museum includes more than forty buildings which represent the architecture of Wales,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; including a [[nonconformist]] chapel (in this case, [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/672|title=Opening ceremony of Pen-rhiw Chapel at the Welsh Folk Museum, St. Fagans, 21 June 1956|website=Peoples Collection Wales|language=en|access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a village schoolhouse, a [[Toll road]] tollbooth (below), a [[Cockfight|cockpit]] (below), a [[Sty|pigsty]] (below), and a [[tannery]] (below).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The museum holds displays of traditional crafts with a working [[blacksmith]] forge, a pottery, a weaver, miller, and clog maker. It also includes two working water mills: one [[flour mill]] and one [[wool]] mill. Part of the site includes a small working farm which concentrates on preserving local Welsh native breeds of livestock. Produce from the museum's bakery and flour mill is available for sale.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The [[St Teilo's Church, Llandeilo Tal-y-bont|medieval parish church of Saint Teilo]], formerly at Llandeilo Tal-y-bont in west [[Glamorgan]] (restored to its pre-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] state), was opened in October 2007 by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Rowan Williams]], and still serves as a place of worship for [[Christmas]], [[Easter]], and [[Harvest Thanksgiving]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] merchant's house from [[Haverfordwest]], opened in 2012, is the latest building to be added to the museum's collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-18664538 BBC News, "Haverfordwest Tudor trader home opens at St Fagans museum", 2 July 2012]. Retrieved 11 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Future plans include the relocation of the historic [[The Vulcan, Cardiff|Vulcan public house]] from [[Newtown, Cardiff|Newtown]] in Cardiff.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-18816130 BBC News – ""Work starts to move Cardiff's Vulcan pub to St Fagans museum", 12 July 2012]. Retrieved 30 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the museum was intended to preserve aspects of Welsh rural life, it now includes several buildings that depict the industrial working life that succeeded it, that being almost extinct in Wales. There is a row of workers' cottages, depicting furnishing from 1800 to 1985, from Rhyd-y-car near [[Merthyr Tydfil]] (below), as well as the pristine [[Oakdale, Caerphilly|Oakdale]] [[Miners' institute|Workmen's Institute]] (below). Even a post-war [[prefabricated building|prefabricated]] [[bungalow]] (below) has been erected on the grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://britishheritage.com/stfagans-time-for-welsh-history|title=St.Fagans: Time for Welsh History|work=British Heritage|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1996 to 2012, the museum hosted the Everyman Summer Theatre Festival when it re-located from [[Dyffryn Gardens]]. This festival, which includes a [[Shakespeare]] play, a Musical, and a Children's Show has become part of Welsh theatrical calendar since its founding at Dyffryn in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.walesartsreview.org/the-power-of-everyman-cardiffs-theatre-festival/|title=The Power of Everyman: Cardiff's Theatre Festival|date=2015-08-04|work=Wales Arts Review|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/showbiz/everyman-takes-plays-outdoors-1906062|title=Everyman takes plays outdoors|last=Owens|first=David|date=2010-07-01|work=walesonline|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theatre-wales.co.uk/companies/company_details.asp?ID=98|title=Details of Everyman Theatre Cardiff on the Theatre in Wales database|website=www.theatre-wales.co.uk|access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Called ''Llys Llewelyn'' ('Llewelyn's Court'), it was hoped school children would be able to stay in the buildings overnight, from Spring 2019.&lt;ref name=revampcomplete2018&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/18/st-fagans-welsh-history-museum-revamp-completed|title='Story of Wales': history museum's six-year revamp completed |work=theguardian.com |date=18 October 2018 |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Gweithdy'' ('Workshop') also opened in October 2018. It is a sustainable building housing improved facilities for visitors, supporting the study of collections and hosting demonstrations and workshops by traditional craftsmen.&lt;ref name=BBCredevopens /&gt;

[[File:Goblins.jpg|thumb|''The Goblins in the Gold-Mine'']]
'''''The Children's Encyclopædia''''' was an [[encyclopædia]] originated by [[Arthur Mee]], and published by the [[Educational Book Company]], a subsidiary of [[Amalgamated Press]] of London. It was published from 1908 to 1964.  [[Walter Montgomery Jackson|Walter M. Jackson]]'s company [[Grolier]] acquired the rights to publish it in the U.S. under the name ''The Book of Knowledge'' (1910).

==Contents==
The encyclopædia was originally published in fortnightly parts between March 1908 and February 1910.  Some readers could have bound their collections, but the first eight-volume sets were published in 1910. Each section contained a variety of articles, developing topics as it progressed. The work could be used as a conventional reference library, as the last volume had an alphabetical index, or each section could be read from start to finish.  It was originally organised into sections but there were changes in subsequent editions.  Some titles covered scientific subjects such as [[geology]], [[biology]] and [[astronomy]] but such scientific terms were generally avoided.

* Familiar Things, by "many writers"
* Wonder, by the Wise Man
* Nature, by [[Ernest Bryant]] and [[Edward Step]]
* The Child's Own Life, by Dr. [[Caleb Saleeby]]
* The Earth, by Dr. Caleb Saleeby
* All Countries, by [[Frances Epps]]
* Great Lives, by "many writers"
* Golden Deeds, by "many writers"
* Bible Stories, by [[Harold Begbie]]
* Famous Books, by [[John Alexander Hammerton|John Hammerton]]
* Stories, by Edward Wright
* Poetry, by John Hammerton
* "School Lessons", by several writers, including [[Lois Mee]], Arthur's sister
* Things To Make and Things To Do, by "many writers"

Mee wrote an introduction called a "Greeting" and a "farewell". He took a strong interest in the "Book of Wonder", in which the Wise Man answered questions posed by children.

The illustrations were mostly anonymous but some illustrators included [[Susan Beatrice Pearse]], [[C. E. Brock]], [[Thomas Maybank]], [[George F. Morrell]], [[Dudley Heath]], [[Charles Folkard]], [[H. R. Millar]], [[Alexander Francis Lydon]], [[Arthur A. Dixon]] and [[Arthur Rackham]]. The books used photographs by [[Frank Hinkins]], engravings, maps and graphics.&lt;ref&gt;''The Children's Encyclopædia'', edited by Arthur Mee (1910), 8 volumes; and later editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

The encyclopædia broke ground in the approach to education, aiming to make learning interesting and enjoyable. Its articles were clearly written and intended to develop character and sense of duty.

The articles expressed pride for [[Great Britain]] and [[British Empire|its empire]]. [[Christianity]] was held to be the only true religion. Europeans were clearly the most advanced and there were hints of the [[eugenic]] ideas of Caleb Saleeby. This was presented in a moderate and liberal way in many areas: other "races", although inferior according to the text, were to be treated with respect, and [[imperialism]] was justified only if it improved the lot of its subjects. At a time when the relation between science and religion was controversial, the encyclopædia supported [[evolution]], but it did not admit any contradiction between religious teachings and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/hermitage/childrensencyclopdia.htm Cf. Michael Tracy (2008)]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419130703/http://www.freewebs.com/hermitage/childrensencyclopdia.htm |date=2011-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
It was sold [[door-to-door]]. It was used by schools and for teacher training. It gives insight into the social values of the society that created it. As the initial run ended, it was reissued as the monthly '''''New Children's Encyclopædia'''''. The title changed, becoming '''''Children's Encyclopædia Magazine''''', '''''Children's Magazine''''' and, finally, ''[[My Magazine]]'' in 1914. From September 1910, the magazine included a supplement of news entitled ''The Little Paper'', the forerunner of Arthur Mee's ''[[Children's Newspaper]]'', launched in 1919.

==Editions==
''The Children's Encyclopædia'' sold 800,000 copies in 12 editions before being extensively revised in the early 1920s. The new 59-part, 7,412-page, 10-volume series debuted in October 1922 as ''The Children's Encyclopedia'', the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] having been dropped, and went through 14 editions by 1946 under the imprint of The Educational Book Co. Translations appeared in [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Brazil]] and [[China]].

New editions of the encyclopedia continued after Mee's death in 1943; the final, much revised, edition, still entitled ''Arthur Mee's Children's Encyclopedia'', appeared in 1964.

While the encyclopedia itself did not carry any copyright or publishing dates, clues are present in the title used and the colour and design on the cover as to the approximate age of a complete collection.  The initial release of ''The Children's Encyclopædia'' featured the spelling "Encyclopædia" and was initially an 8 volume collection, bound in brown.  All other revisions used the spelling "Encyclopedia" and were a 10 volume collection. 1920 versions have blue binding.  By the 1940s the binding is brown in colour, and displays a flaming torch on each book's spine.  By the 1950s, the binding is red.&lt;ref&gt;http://messybeast.com/history/books-of-wonder.htm&lt;/ref&gt; There is also at least one green bound version that dates from the 1920s. One edition with a red binding and art deco patterning on the spine dates to the mid 1930s.

== Kashmir riots ==
In [[May 1973]] [[riots]] occurred in [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[India]], in an area where the [[Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir|Jamaat-e-Islami]] was gaining influence, sparked by the discovery that an illustration contained in ''The Book of Knowledge'', which had been stored in a local library for decades, portrayed the [[Gabriel#Islam|Archangel Gabriel]] dictating portions of the [[Quran]] to [[Muhammad]]. Muslims offended by a [[Depictions of Muhammad#Figurative visual depictions|visual depiction of Muhammad]] caused riots which left four dead and over a hundred wounded. The sale of the encyclopedia was then banned, although it was already out of print by that time.&lt;ref name="Sisk2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Timothy D.

This was one of [[Fran Brill]]'s final works before she retired from puppeteer work. As of 2016, and the following season, [[Stephanie D'Abruzzo]] will be Prairie Dawn and [[Jennifer Barnhart]] will be Zoe.

==Synopsis==
A new museum, the Museum of Cookie Art, has opened on Sesame Street and [[Cookie Monster]] has decided to attend with his friends Chris and [[Elmo]] where [[Prairie Dawn]] is working there as a [[tour guide]]. Upon seeing the art, which parodies art masterpieces such as [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci's]] ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', Cookie Monster wants to eat everything he sees, prompting Chris to remind him that he can only look at it and not eat it. Even a female security guard ([[Rachel Dratch]]) tends to catch him almost committing the acts. However, when the cookie paintings start disappearing, the female security guard and the Penguin security guards believe that Cookie Monster is the thief. Elmo decides to take on the role of [[detective]] to figure out who stole them. He finds a trail of cookie crumbs and [[chocolate chips]], which he correctly guesses proves the thief to be an [[anthropomorphic]] [[chocolate chip cookie]]. The trio tries to tell the guards, who do not believe them and throw them out of the museum.

Once outside, they manage to contact [[Abby Cadabby]] who magically transforms them into a painting. She then takes the painting to museum, where it is displayed and then stolen by the Cookie Thief. They then change back to their normal forms and, along with the museum's guards who now believe in Cookie Monster's innocence, chase the thief.

Upon capture the Cookie Thief confesses to his crimes, which he explains he only did because of his love for cookie art. Cookie explains that while he understands his motivations, that if he stole the paintings then no one else could enjoy the artwork. He then tells the Cookie Thief that he can create his own cookie art and have it displayed in the museum, which the thief does.

'''The Global Lepidoptera Names Index''' ('''LepIndex''') is a searchable [[database]] maintained by the Department of Entomology at the [[Natural History Museum, London]].

It is based on card indices and scanned journals, nomenclatural catalogues and the ''[[Zoological Record]]''. It contains the majority of world's Lepidoptera names published up until 1981 and for some groups is up to date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/data/lepindex/intro.html The Global Lepidoptera Names Index Introduction]. Retrieved  2011-01-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Lepidoptera Names Index or LepIndex allows anyone free internet access to:

A '''touch piece''' is a [[coin]] or [[medal]] believed to cure [[disease]], bring good [[luck]], influence people's behaviour, carry out a specific practical action, etc.

What most touch pieces have in common is that they have to be touched or in close physical contact for the power concerned to be obtained and/or transferred. Once this is achieved, the power is permanently present in the coin, which effectively becomes an [[amulet]].

==Cure of diseases by coins==
Coins which had been given at [[Holy Communion]] could be rubbed on parts of the body suffering from [[rheumatism]] and it was thought that they would effect a cure. Medallions or medalets showing the "Devil defeated" were specially minted in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and distributed amongst the poor in the belief that they would reduce disease and sickness.&lt;ref name="Waring"&gt;Waring, Philippa (1987). ''The Dictionary of Omens &amp; Superstitions''. Treasure Press. {{ISBN|1-85051-009-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of touch pieces goes back to the time of Ancient [[Rome]], when the Emperor [[Vespasian]] (69–79 AD) gave coins to the sick at a ceremony known as "the touching".&lt;ref name="DeAgostini"&gt;''Coins of the World''. [[De Agostini]] (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many touch piece coins were treasured by the recipients and sometimes remained in the possession of families for many generations, such as with the "Lee Penny" obtained by [[Simon Locard|Sir Simon Lockhart]] from the [[Holy Land]] whilst on a crusade. This coin, an Edward I [[groat (coin)|groat]], still held by the family, has a triangular-shaped stone of a dark red colour set into it. The coin is kept in a gold box given by Queen Victoria to General Lockhart.&lt;ref name="Leighton"&gt;Leighton, John M. (1840?). ''Strath-Clutha or the Beauties of the Clyde.'' Glasgow. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; It can supposedly cure [[rabies]], [[haemorrhage]], and various animal ailments. The coin was exempted from the Church of Scotland's prohibition on charms and was lent to the citizens of Newcastle during the reign of King Charles I to protect them from the [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. A sum of between £1,000 and £6,000 was pledged for its return.&lt;ref&gt;Westwood, Jennifer and Kingshill, Sophia (2009). ''The Lore of Scotland. A guide to Scottish Legends.'' London: Random House. {{ISBN|978-1-905211-62-3}} p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend of the Lee Penny gave rise to [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott's]] novel ''[[The Talisman (1825)|The Talisman]]''. The amulet was placed in water, which was then drunk to provide the cure. No money was ever taken for its use.&lt;ref name="Coin News05"&gt;''Coin News'', April 2005. Token Publishing. {{ISSN|0958-1391}}. pp. 29–32.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1629 Isobel Young, burned as a witch later that same year,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digital.nls.uk/broadsides/broadside.cfm/id/14724|title=Broadside account concerning trials and executions for 'Witchcraft, Adultery, Fornication, &amp;c. &amp;c.'|last=|first=|date=|website=National Library of Scotland|language=en|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; sought to borrow the stone to cure cattle. The family of Lockart of Lee would not lend the stone in its silver setting; however, they gave flagons of water in which the coin had been steeped.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, Robert (1885). ''Domestic Annals of Scotland''. Edinburgh: W &amp; R Chambers. pp. 233–234.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healing of the King's or Queen's Evil===
[[File:Anniex.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Queen Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]]]
Persons of royal blood were thought to have the "God-given" power of [[royal touch|healing this condition by touch]], and sovereigns of England and France practised this power to cure sufferers of [[scrofula]], meaning "Swine Evil", as it was common in pigs,&lt;ref name="Coin News99"&gt;''Coin News'', January 1999. Token Publishing. {{ISSN|0958-1391}}. pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; a form of [[tuberculosis]] of the bones and lymph nodes, commonly known as the "King's or Queen's Evil"&lt;ref name="Bradley"&gt;Bradley, Howard W. (1978). ''A Handbook of Coins of the British Isles.'' Robert Hale. {{ISBN|0-7091-6747-4}}. p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; or "Morbus Regius". In France it was called the ''Mal De Roi''.&lt;ref name="Coin News05"/&gt; [[William the Lion]], King of Scotland is recorded in 1206 as curing a case of scrofula by his touching and blessing a child who had the ailment.&lt;ref name="Dalrymple"&gt;Dalrymple, Sir David (1776). ''Annals of Scotland''. London: J. Murray. pp. 300–301.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles I touched around 100 people shortly after his coronation at Holyrood in 1633.&lt;ref name= "Danie21"&gt;Daniel, William S. (1852), ''History of The Abbey and Palace of Holyrood''. Edinburgh: Duncan Anderson. p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely fatal, the disease was naturally given to spontaneously cure itself after lengthy periods of remission. Many miraculous cures were recorded, and failures were put down to a lack of faith in the sufferer. The original ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' of the [[Anglican Church]] contained this ceremony. The divine power of kings was believed to be descended from Edward the Confessor, who, according to some legends, received it from [[Saint Remigius]].

The custom lasted from the time of [[Edward the Confessor]] until [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]'s reign, although her predecessor, [[William III of England|William III]] refused to believe in the tradition and did not practice the ceremony. [[James II of England|James II]] and [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], the Old Pretender, performed the ceremony. [[Charles Edward Stuart]], the "Young Pretender", is known to have carried out the rite in 1745 at [[Glamis Castle]] during the time of his rebellion against [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] and also in France after his exile. Finally, [[Henry Benedict Stuart]], the brother of Charles, performed the ceremony until his death in 1807. All the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] [[Stuarts]] produced special touch-piece medalets, with a variety of designs and inscriptions. They are found in gold, silver and even lead.&lt;ref name="Coin NewsMay"&gt;''Coin News'', May 2005. Token Publishing. {{ISSN|0958-1391}}. pp. 36–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert II of France]] was the first to practise the ritual in the 11th century.&lt;ref name="Coin News05"/&gt; [[Henry IV of France]] is reported as often touching and healing as many as 1,500 individuals at a time. No record survives of the first four Norman kings' attempting to cure by touching; however, there are records of [[Henry II of England]] doing so. [[Mary I of England]] performed the ceremony&lt;ref name="Tudor"&gt;Ross, Josephine (1979). ''The Tudors.'' London: Arctus. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; and her half-sister, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], cured all "ranks and degrees".  [[William Tooker]] published a book on the subject, titled ''Charisma; sive Donum Sanationis''.

[[File:Holyrood Palace and Abbey from above.jpg|thumb|left|Holyrood Palace and Abbey 2006]]
Queen Anne, amongst many others, touched the 2-year-old infant [[Dr. Samuel Johnson]] in 1712 to no effect, for although he eventually recovered, he was left badly scarred and blind in one eye.&lt;ref name="Coin News03"&gt;''Coin News'', December 2003. Token Publishing. {{ISSN|0958-1391}}. pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; He wore the medal around his neck all of his life and it is now preserved in the [[British Museum]]. It was believed that if the touch piece was not worn then the condition would return. Queen Anne last performed the ceremony on 14 April 1714.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Werrett|first=Simon|title=Healing the Nation's Wounds: Royal Ritual and Experimental Philosophy in Restoration England|journal=History of Science|volume=38|year=2000|pages=377–399|bibcode=2000HisSc..38..377W}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] put an end to the practice as being "too Catholic", but the kings of France continued the custom until 1825. [[William of Malmesbury]]&lt;ref name="William"&gt;William of Malmesbury, (1815). ''Chronicle of the Kings of England'', [[J. A. Giles]] (ed.), trans. John Sharpe. London: George Bell and Sons, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; describes the ceremony in his ''Chronicle of the Kings of England'' (1120) and [[Shakespeare]] describes the practice in ''[[Macbeth]]''.

The gold [[Angel (coin)|Angel]] coins, which were first struck in Britain in 1465 and later dates, particularly of the reigns of [[James I of England|James I]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], are often found officially pierced in the centre, as illustrated in ''Coins of England 2001''&lt;ref name="Spink"&gt;''Coins of England and the United Kingdom.'' (2001). 36th Edition. Spink. {{ISBN|1-902040-36-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to be used as touch pieces. The sovereigns of the [[House of Stuart]] used the ceremony to help bolster the belief in the "[[Divine Right of Kings]]".&lt;ref name="McKay"&gt;McKay, James and Mussell, John W. (eds.) (2001). ''The Coin Yearbook 2001''. Token Publishing. {{ISBN|1-870192-36-2}}. p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles I indeed issued Angels almost exclusively as touch pieces to the point where intact specimens are hard to come by.&lt;ref name="Sutherland"&gt;Sutherland, C.H.V. (1982). ''English Coinage 600–1900''. Batsford. {{ISBN|0-7134-0731-X}}. P. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first monarch to perform the ceremony in Scotland at [[Holyrood Palace]] on 18 June 1633. The size of the hole may indicate the amount of gold taken in payment by the jeweller or the mint for the work of piercing or punching and the provision of a ribbon or silk string.&lt;ref name="Coin NewsMay"/&gt;

[[File:Charles II of England.jpeg|thumb|upright|Charles II]]
The cure was usually more of a "laying on of hands" by the monarch and the Angel coin or medalet, etc., although touched by the monarch, was seen as a receipt or talisman of the potential of the monarch's healing power. Originally the king had paid for the support of the sufferer until he had recovered or died. The move to the gift of a gold coin touch piece may represent the compromise payment when the custom of "room and board" support by the king ceased.&lt;ref name="Coin News05"/&gt; [[Coffee]] in the 18th and early 19th centuries was thought to be a relief, but not a cure for scrofula.

The Angel coin was favoured at these ceremonies because it has on the obverse an image of [[St. Michael]] slaying the [[Devil]] represented as a dragon (actually a heraldic [[Wyvern]]).&lt;ref name="Lobel"&gt;Lobel, Richard; Davidson, Mark; Hailstone, Allan and Calligas, Eleni (1999). ''Coincraft's 1999 Standard catalogue of English and UK Coins 1066 to Date.'' Coincraft. {{ISBN|0-9526228-6-6}}. p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; St. Michael, especially venerated for his role as captain of the heavenly host that drove [[Satan]] out of [[Heaven]], was also associated with the casting out of devils and thus was regarded as a guardian of the sick.&lt;ref name="Seaby"&gt;Seaby, Peter (1985). ''The Story of British Coinage''. Seaby. {{ISBN|0-900652-74-8}} p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The monarch him/herself hung these touch piece [[amulet]]s around the necks of sufferers. In later years [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] only touched the medalet as he unsurprisingly disliked touching diseased people directly. He "touched" 92,107 people in the 21 years from 1661 to 1682, performing the function 8,500 times in 1682 alone.&lt;ref name="Coin News99"/&gt;

After these coins ceased to be minted in 1634, Charles II had holed gold medalets specially produced by the mint with a similar design of good defeating evil.&lt;ref name="Bradley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seaby"/&gt; An example of a medalet in the [[British Museum]] has a hand descending from a cloud towards four heads, with "He touched them" around the margin, and on the other side a rose and thistle, with "And they were healed."

[[Samuel Pepys]] recorded in his diary for 13 April 1661: "To Whitehall to the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall|Banquet House]] and there saw the King heale, the first time that ever I saw him do it&amp;nbsp;— which he did with great gravity; and it seemed to me to be an ugly office and a simple one."&lt;ref name="Latham"&gt;Latham, Robert (ed.) (1985). ''The Illustrated Pepys. Extracts from the Diary.'' Bell &amp; Hyman. {{ISBN|0-7135-1328-4}}. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Evelyn]] also refers to the ceremony in his ''[[John Evelyn's Diary|Diary]]'' on the dates of 6 July 1660 and 28 March 1684.&lt;ref name="Chamberlain"&gt;Chamberlain, C. C. (1963). ''The Teach Yourself Guide to Numismatics: An A.B.C. of coins and coin collecting.'' English Universities Press. pp. 4, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Wain in his biography of Dr. Samuel Johnson writes that Johnson was taken by his mother as a small child to London, where after standing in a long line with many others, he was in turn subject to this ritual from Queen Anne.

Unsurprisingly the system was open to abuse and numerous attempts were made to ensure that only the deserving cases got the gold coin, because others would simply sell it.&lt;ref name="Roud"&gt;Roud, Steven (2003). ''The Penguin Guide to the Superstitions of Britain and Ireland.'' Penguin Books. p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Luck and coins==

===Good luck coins===
[[File:Mandragora Tacuinum Sanitatis.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Illustration of a mandrake, believed to have magical properties, from the 15th century manuscript ''[[Tacuinum Sanitatis]]''.]]
In many countries it was believed that coins with holes in them would bring good luck. This belief could link to a similar superstition linked to stones or pebbles which had holes, often called "Adder Stones" and hung around the neck. Carrying a coin bearing the date of your birth is lucky. In [[Austria]] any coin found during a rainstorm is especially lucky, because it is said to have dropped from [[Heaven]]. European [[amulet|charms]] often require silver coins to be used, which are engraved with marks such as an "X" or are bent. These actions personalize the coin, making it uniquely special for the owner. The lucky "[[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]]" is a well-known example in [[Great Britain]].

Holy Sacrament communion coins were thought to acquire curative powers over various ailments, especially rheumatism and epilepsy. Such otherwise normal coins, which had been offered at communion, were purchased from the priest for 12 or 13 pennies. The coin was then punched through and worn around the neck of the sick person, or made into a ring.&lt;ref name="Coin NewsJuly"&gt;Coin News. Pub. Token. {{ISSN|0958-1391}}. July 2005. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gonzalez-Wippler records that if money is left with a [[mandrake (mythology)|mandrake]] root it will double in quantity overnight. She also stated that the way to ensure the future wealth of a baby is to put part of the child's umbilical cord in a bag together with a few coins. Lucky coins are lucky charms which are carried around attract wealth and good luck, whilst many, often silver coins, attached to bracelets multiply the effect as well as create a noise which scares away evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez-Wippler, Migene (2001). ''The Complete Book of Amulets and Talismans''. Llewellyn Publications. {{ISBN|0-87542-287-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bathing with a penny wrapped in a washcloth brings good fortune at [[Beltane]] or the [[Winter Solstice]] in [[Celtic Mythology]]. Chinese "Money Frogs" or "Money Toads", often with a coin in their mouths, bring food, luck and prosperity.

[[File:Mercury dime.jpg|thumb|225px|left|1936 Winged Liberty Head (Mercury) dime]]
A Celtic belief is that at the [[full moon]] any silver coins on one's person should be jingled or turned over to prevent bad luck, also the silver coins would increase as the moon grew in size.&lt;ref name="Coin News02"&gt;Coin News. Pub. Token. {{ISSN|0958-1391}}. July 2002. pp. 43–45.&lt;/ref&gt; A wish to a new moon could also be made, but not as seen through glass, jingling coins at the same time.&lt;ref name="Griffith"&gt;Griffith, M.J.S. (1970). Oral communication to Griffith, Roger S. Ll.&lt;/ref&gt; American silver "Mercury" dimes, especially with a [[leap year]] date, are especially lucky. Gamblers' charms are often these [[dime (U.S. coin)|dime]]s, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] being the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] god who ruled the crossroads, games of chance, etc. Although these dimes actually figure the head of [[Liberty]], people commonly mistake it for Mercury. A silver dime worn at the throat will supposedly turn black if someone tries to poison your food or drink. American "Indian Head" cents are worn as [[amulet]]s to ward off evil or negative spirits. In [[Spain]] a bride places a silver coin from her father in one shoe and a gold coin from her mother in the other. This will ensure that she will never want for anything. Silver coins were placed in [[Christmas pudding]]s and [[birthday cake]]s to bring good luck and wealth.&lt;ref name="Coin News02"/&gt; A variation on this custom was that in some families each member added a coin to the pudding bowl, making a wish as they did so. If their coin turned up in their bowl it's said their wish was sure to come true. In Greece, a coin is added to [[vasilopita]], a bread baked in honor of the [[feast day]] of [[Basil the Great|St. Basil the Great]]. At midnight the [[sign of the cross]] is etched with a knife across the cake, to bless the house and bring good luck for the new year. A piece is sliced for each member of the family and any visitors present at the time, and the person who gets the slice with the coin will receive good luck, and often a gift.

In [[Japan]] the 5 yen coin is considered lucky because 5 yen in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is "Go en" which is a [[homophone]] with go-en (御縁), "en" being a word for causal connection or relationship, and "go" being a respectful prefix. Therefore, they are often used at shrines as well as the first money put into a new wallet.

In ancient [[Rome]] "good luck" coins were in common circulation. "Votive pieces" for example were struck by new emperors, promising peace for a set number of years. Citizens would hold such coins in their hand when making a wish or petitioning the gods.&lt;ref name="Coin NewsJuly"/&gt;

Coins bearing religious symbols are often seen as lucky; for instance, the [[Mughal Empire|Mogul]] emperor [[Akbar]]'s rupees carry words from the [[Islamic]] faith, and in India the ''[[Ramatanka]]'' shows the Hindu god [[Rama]], his wife, [[Sita]], his brother and the monkey god, [[Hanuman]]. Gold [[ducats]] issued in the name of the mid-18th century [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] Loredano of [[Venice]] bore an image of Christ and were issued to be worn as pendants by [[pilgrims]]. The [[Shinto]] religion has a shrine called Zeniariai-Benten where followers wash their money in the spring water at certain times of year to ensure that it doubles in quantity. In Roman times, sailors placed coins under the masts of their ships to ensure the protection of the gods from the wrath of the sea.&lt;ref name="DeAgostini"/&gt;

A rare example of a "[[Wish Tree]]" exists near Ardmaddy House in Argyll, Scotland. The tree is a [[common hawthorn|hawthorn]], a species traditionally linked with fertility, as in "May Blossom." The trunk and branches are covered with hundreds of coins which have been driven through the bark and into the wood. The local tradition is that a wish will be granted for each of the coins so treated.&lt;ref name="Rodger"&gt;Rodger, Donald, Stokes, John &amp; Ogilve, James (2006). ''Heritage Trees of Scotland''. The Tree Council. p. 87. {{ISBN|0-904853-03-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many pubs, such as the "Punch Bowl" in [[Askham, Cumbria|Askham]], near Penrith in Cumbria have old beams with splits in them where coins are forced "for luck."

Another local custom at [[Askham, Cumbria|Askham]] is the throwing of coins from the nearby bridge onto a boulder that lies below the water level of the river. Getting the coin to stay on the rock gives the thrower "good luck." Obvious connections exist with water generally and the practice of throwing in coins to seek favours of the water spirits. The [[Lady's Well]] in [[Kilmaurs]], Scotland, is a typical wishing well. At St. Cuby's Well (SX224 564) in [[Cornwall]] the legend was that if anyone did not leave an offering of money then they would be followed home by [[Piskie]]s in the shape of flying moths, embodying the spirits of the dead.&lt;ref name="Straffon"&gt;Straffon, Cherly (1998). ''Fentynyow Kernow. In Search of Cornwall's Holy Wells''. Pub. Meyn Mamvro. p. 25 {{ISBN|0-9518859-5-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At Loch na Gaire in [[Sutherland]], Scotland, it was the tradition to throw coins into the waters to ensure that the waters kept their healing properties.&lt;ref name="Beare6"&gt;Beare, Beryl (1996), ''Scotland. Myths &amp; Legends.'' Pub. Parragon, Avonmouth. p. 66 {{ISBN|0-7525-1694-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A "Black Saxpence" in [[Scots language|Scots]], is a sixpence, supposed by the credulous to be received from the devil, as a pledge of an engagement to be his, soul and body. It is always of a black colour, as not being legal currency; but it is said to possess this singular virtue, that the person who keeps it constantly in his pocket, ''how much soever he spend, will always find another sixpence beside it''.

A [[Devon]]ian superstition is that carrying crooked coins is good luck and keeps the devil away.&lt;ref name="Hewet51"&gt;Hewett, Sarah (1900). ''Nummits and Crummits.'' Devonshire Customs, Characteristics and Folk-lore. Pub. Thomas Burleigh. p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bad luck coins===
In Ireland it is thought to be bad luck to give money away on a Monday.

The 1932 silver yuan coin from China showed a [[junk (ship)|junk]], rays of sunshine and a flock of birds. These were seen as symbolising Japan (the rising sun symbol) and its fighter planes (the birds) invading China. The coin was re-issued in 1933 without the sun or the birds.

The Queen Victoria "Godless" florin (which omitted all the Queen's titles, including the customary Dei Gratia, ''by the grace of god'') was regarded as bringing bad luck.

Finding money was bad luck in some cultures and the curse could only be removed by giving away the money.&lt;ref name="DeAgostini"/&gt;

It is bad luck to have an empty pocket, for even a crooked coin keeps the devil away.&lt;ref name="Hewett53"&gt;Hewett, Sarah (1900). ''Nummits and Crummits.'' Devonshire Customs, Characteristics and Folk-lore. Pub. Thomas Burleigh. p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Love tokens==
The bent coin as a love token may be derived from the well-recorded practice of bending a coin when making a vow to a saint, such as vowing to give it to the saint's shrine if the saint would intercede to cure a sick human, animal, etc. Bending a coin when one person made a vow to another was another practice which arose from this.&lt;ref name="Coin News98"&gt;Coin News. Pub. Token. {{ISSN|0958-1391}}. July 1998. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protection against evil==
It was believed that the gift of second sight came from the devil; as protection, a silver coin was used to make a cross above the palm of a [[Romani people|Gypsy]] fortune-teller, thus dispelling any evil. In Japan, Korea and Indonesia, coins were made tied together to form sword shapes which were thought to terrify, and therefore ward off, evil spirits. They were also hung above the beds of sick people to drive off the malevolent spirits who were responsible for the illness.&lt;ref name="Coin News02"/&gt;

==Curse coins==
In 2007 a lead "coin based" curse on a Roman emperor was found by a metal detectorist in Lincolnshire. The 1,650-year-old curse was an act of treason, blasphemy and criminal defacement of the imperial coinage. The perpetrator had cursed the emperor [[Valens]] by hammering a coin with his image into lead, then folding the lead over his face. Thousands of ordinary lead cursing charms exist with written inscriptions and a small hole for suspending them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Roman Curse Coin |url=http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2007/12/16/romancoin372x192.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/dec/17/maevkennedy.uknews4&amp;usg=__bqQFB-FmsTE-xEHbLuvJW5ZE-lo=&amp;h=192&amp;w=372&amp;sz=19&amp;hl=en&amp;start=19&amp;tbnid=7p0i9Pff_lXE4M:&amp;tbnh=63&amp;tbnw=122&amp;prev=/images%3Fq%3Ddefaced%2Bcoins%26gbv%3D2%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-GB:official%26sa%3DG |accessdate=2009-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Touch pieces that influence behaviour==
Coins placed on the eyes of the dead, if briefly dropped into the drink of a husband or wife, would "blind" them to any infidelities that the partner might be involved in.&lt;ref name="Waring"/&gt;

Also, some groups say that if a penny is thrown into a person's drink, they must "down" the rest of it.

==Coins carrying out a specific practical action==
[[File:Sator Square at Oppède.jpg|thumb|125px|The Sator square]]
In Germany, since Medieval times, it was believed that a silver coin with a [[Sator square]] engraved on it will put out a fire if thrown into the conflagration.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Coins were placed on the eyes of a corpse to prevent them from opening and also in [[Greek mythology]] as payment for the ferryman who would carry the dead person across the [[River Styx]] into [[Hades]].&lt;ref name="Coin News02"/&gt; In the 17th century coins bearing an engraving of St. George were carried by soldiers as a protection against injury following a lucky escape when a bullet hit such a coin and the soldier remained uninjured (Coins of the World).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Some of the gold coins of [[Edward III]] carry the cryptic legend: IHS MEDIVM ILLORVM IBAT ("But Jesus passing through the midst of them, went his way" – St'Luke IV. 30). According to [[Sir John Mandeville]], this was a spell against the power of thieves.&lt;ref name="Chamberlain"/&gt;

The '''Tucson Gay Museum''' is an effort whose mission is to collect, preserve and exhibit the histories of the Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Queer LGBTQ History of [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/tucson-gay-museum/Event?oid=3375493 |title=Tucson Gay Museum &amp;#124; Museums |publisher=Tucson Weekly |date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum exhibits include regional LGBTQ history along with items of national and international scope as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tucsoncitizen.com/locally-vocally/2012/06/28/featuring-tucson-virtual-rainbow-connection/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20131118022531/http://tucsoncitizen.com/locally-vocally/2012/06/28/featuring-tucson-virtual-rainbow-connection/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-11-18 |title=In The Aggregate - Arizona's political blogs » Arizona Conservative |publisher=Tucsoncitizen.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tucson Gay Museum collaborates under pre-existing agreements with numerous archives and museums worldwide collecting LGBTQ History, LGBTQ Memories and LGBTQ Collections.

==History==
The Tucson Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Queer LGBT LGBTQ Museum began on June 6, 1967 as an archiving project when a few local neighborhood school age boys came together to collect historical items, take photographs, make sound recordings in and around their community of LGBTQ events and subjects along with other history. As time when along the group began collecting LGBTQ historical related exhibit items from around Arizona, including [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and others areas of the [[United States]]. The Tucson Gay LGBT LGBTQ Queer Museum still remains an all-volunteer effort. Its founding members used their own film loaded cameras and many developed their own film while collecting, photographing, filming, and archiving memorabilia to create historical exhibits for an almost continual 50 year time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://profiles.google.com/114421459095433565858/about |title=Tucson Gay Museum - Google-profiel |publisher=Profiles.google.com |date=2013-10-18 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years since those legendary historical days of the 1960s in the United States, the project gained broader focuses at times including the production of LGBTQ related historical movie documentaries, an LGBTQ related TV Show, sponsoring LGBTQ events, providing educational exhibits at events, working with local LGBTQ organizations, fielding LGBTQ historical documentary crews, and working with national and international LGBTQ historical groups on LGBTQ historical preservation. The Tucson Gay LGBT LGBTQ Queer Museum was the first virtual Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Queer Museum to open in the World.

==Traveling Tucson LGBTQ Memories Project==
