'''127''' ('''one hundred [and] twenty-seven''') is the [[natural number]] following [[126 (number)|126]] and preceding [[128 (number)|128]]. It is also a prime number.

== In mathematics ==

*As a [[Mersenne prime]], 127 is related to the [[perfect number]] [[8128 (number)|8128]]. 127 is also an exponent for another Mersenne prime 2&lt;sup&gt;127&lt;/sup&gt; - 1, which was discovered by [[Édouard Lucas]] in 1876, and held the record for the [[Largest known prime number|largest known prime]] for 75 years - it is the largest prime ever discovered by hand calculations, as well as the largest known [[double Mersenne prime]]. Furthermore, 127 is equal to 2&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; - 1, and 7 is equal to 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; - 1, and 3 is the smallest Mersenne prime, this makes 7 the smallest double Mersenne prime and 127 the smallest triple Mersenne prime.
*127 is also a [[cuban prime]] of the form &lt;math&gt;p = (x^3 - y^3) / (x - y)&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;x = y + 1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A002407|title=Sloane's A002407 : Cuban primes|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next prime is 131, with which it comprises a [[cousin prime]]. Because the next [[odd number]], 129, is a [[semiprime]], 127 is a [[Chen prime]]. 127 is greater than the arithmetic mean of its two neighboring primes, thus it is a [[strong prime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A051634|title=Sloane's A051634 : Strong primes|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*127 is a [[centered hexagonal number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A003215|title=Sloane's A003215 : Hex (or centered hexagonal) numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It is the 7th [[Motzkin number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A001006|title=Sloane's A001006 : Motzkin numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*127 is a [[palindromic prime]] in [[nonary]] and [[Binary number|binary]].
*It is the first nice [[Friedman number]] in base 10, since 127 = -1 + 2&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as binary since 1111111 = (1 + 1)&lt;sup&gt;111&lt;/sup&gt; - 1 * 1.
*127 is the sum of the sums of the divisors of the first 12 [[positive integers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|A024916|name=sum_{k=1..n} sigma(k) where sigma(n) = sum of divisors of n}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*127 is the smallest prime that can be written as the sum of the first two or more odd primes: 127 = 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|A071148}}. Partial sums of sequence of odd primes; a(n) = sum of the first n odd primes.&lt;/ref&gt;
*127 is the smallest odd number that can't be written in the form p + 2&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; for p=[[prime number]] and x=[[integer]], since 127 - 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 126, 127 - 2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = 125, 127 - 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 123, 127 - 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 119, 127 - 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 111, 127 - 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = 95, and 127 - 2&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; = 63 are all [[composite number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|A006285|Odd numbers not of form p + 2^x (de Polignac numbers)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*127 is an isolated prime where both p-2 and p+2 isn't prime.

'''168''' ('''one hundred [and] sixty-eight''') is the natural number following [[167 (number)|167]] and preceding [[169 (number)|169]].

==In mathematics==
168 is an [[even number]], a [[composite number]], an [[abundant number]], and an [[idoneal number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000926|title=Sloane's A000926 : Euler's "numerus idoneus" (or "numeri idonei", or idoneal, or suitable, or convenient numbers)|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 168 [[prime number|primes]] less than [[1000 (number)|1000]]. 168 is the product of the first two [[perfect number]]s.

168 is the order of the group [[PSL(2,7)]], the second smallest [[Nonabelian group|nonabelian]] [[simple group]].

From [[Hurwitz's automorphisms theorem]], 168 is the [[maximum]] possible number of automorphisms of a genus 3 [[Riemann surface]], this maximum being achieved by the [[Klein quartic]], whose symmetry group is PSL(2,7).&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week214.html  This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fano plane]] has 168 [[symmetries]].

168 is the sum of four consecutive [[prime number]]s: [[37 (number)|37]] + [[41 (number)|41]] + [[43 (number)|43]] + [[47 (number)|47]].

In a market with &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; assets, a trading strategy &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; is ''admissible'' if &lt;math&gt;x^T \bar{S} = x^T \frac{S}{1+r}&lt;/math&gt; is almost surely bounded from below.

Lubotzky received the [[Erdős Prize]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/info/prize.html About the Institute] Einstein Institute of Mathematics&lt;/ref&gt; in the years 1994–1996 Lubotzky was the chairman of Einstein Institute of Mathematics at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].

In 1992 Lubotzky was a recipient of the [[Sunyer i Balaguer]] Prize from the Institut d'Estudis Catalans for his book "Discrete Groups Expanding Graphs and Invariant Measures" and again in 2002 with [[Dan Segal]] for their book "Subgroup Growth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/200206/people.pdf Sunyer i Balaguer Prize Awarded], [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]], vol 49 (2002), no. 6, p. 687&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 he has received the [[Yad Hanadiv#Prizes and Fellowships|Rothschild Prize]] in mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Official site of the Rothschild Prize | url = http://www.yadhanadiv.org.il/node/608/view/recipients?field_rp_first_name_value=alexander&amp;field_rp_last_name_value=lubotzky&amp;date_filter%5Bvalue%5D%5Byear%5D=2002&amp;date_filter%5Bvalue%5D%5Bmonth%5D=0&amp;date_filter%5Bvalue%5D%5Bday%5D=0&amp;date_filter%5Bvalue%5D%5Bhour%5D=0&amp;date_filter%5Bvalue%5D%5Bminute%5D=0&amp;date_filter%5Bvalue%5D%5Bsecond%5D=0&amp;field_rp_category_value_many_to_one=mathematics&amp;field_rp_search_disciplines_value_many_to_one=All}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lubotzky  is listed as an [[ISI highly cited researcher]] in mathematics since 2003.

Lubotzky was elected a foreign member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/200507/people.pdf American Academy Elections], [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]], vol. 52 (2005), no. 7, p. 764&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005-6 He led in the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] a year long program on "Pro-finite groups and the congruence subgroup problem". In 2006, he got an honorary degree from the [[University of Chicago]] for his contribution to Modern [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://convocation.uchicago.edu/page/2000 Honorary Degrees] [[University of Chicago]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Lubotzky received the [[European Research Council]] (ERC) advanced grant for exceptional established research leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.huji.ac.il/HeaderMenu/campaign-priorities-2/young-faculty-recruitment/oxford-ties/ Hebrew U. ties with Oxford University in number of new European Research Council grants in past two years] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303032602/http://support.huji.ac.il/HeaderMenu/campaign-priorities-2/young-faculty-recruitment/oxford-ties/ |date=3 March 2012 }} [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Lubotzky was chosen to be the keynote speaker at the joint meeting of the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS) and the [[Mathematical Association of America]] (MAA) in New Orleans. Lubotzky's keynote address in front of the conference's 6,000 attendees marked the first time that an Israeli was the keynote speaker at one of these conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/140788 Top Israeli Mathematician to Be Honored] [[Arutz Sheva]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 he was a visiting researcher at [[Microsoft Research Center]].

In 2014, he was elected to the [[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Health/Israel-Academy-of-Sciences-and-Humanities-add-five-new-researchers-to-its-prestigious-ranks-385411 Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities add five new researchers to its prestigious ranks] The [[Jerusalem Post]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Lubotzky received the [[European Research Council]] (ERC) advanced grant for exceptional established research leaders,&lt;ref&gt;[https://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/erc_2015_adg_results_all_domains.pdf ERC Advanced Grants 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; becoming one of the only researchers receiving the grant twice.

In honor of Lubotzky's sixtieth birthday The [[Israel Institute for Advanced Studies]] hosted a conference (Midrasha) from 5 November through 11 November 2016, with scholars from around the world convening to celebrate his work, impact, and collaborations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.as.huji.ac.il/schools/math20 The 20th Midrasha Mathematicae celebrating Alex Lubotzky's 60th Birthday] [[Israel Institute for Advanced Studies]], [[Jerusalem]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
A founding member of The [[Third Way (Israel)|Third Way]] in March 1996, he chaired its secretariat and was elected to the Knesset in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1996|May 1996 elections]]. He served as a member of the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee; Constitution, Law and [[Justice]] Committee; [[Status of Women]] Committee and the Science and Technology Committee, and chaired the subcommittee on the [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K Bug]].

As an MK, Prof. Lubotzky was mainly known for his compromise proposals on religious issues and [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]]. He was actively involved in setting up a solution to the conversion bill crisis via the Ne'eman Commission, working to avoid a conflict between [[Israel]] and the [[Jewish Diaspora]]. Prof. Lubotzky also co-drafted a comprehensive proposal for a new [[Covenant (law)|covenant]] for religion-state affairs in Israel with MK [[Yossi Beilin]].

==Personal life==
Lubotzky married Yardenna (daughter of [[Murray Roston]]), a lecturer in [[Art History]] and [[English studies|English]], in 1980. The couple had six children; the oldest, Asael, was injured severely in the [[Battle of Bint Jbeil]] in Lebanon, while serving as an [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in the IDF in the [[2006 Lebanon war]] and after his rehabilitation became a physician.&lt;ref name="Lubotzky"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lubotzky|first=Asael|title=[[From the Wilderness and Lebanon]]|year=2016|publisher=[[Koren Publishers Jerusalem]]|isbn=978-1592644179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4340">'''Alison M. Marr''' is an American mathematician and [[mathematics education|mathematics educator]]. Her research concerns [[graph theory]] and [[graph labeling]], and she is also an advocate of [[inquiry-based learning]] in mathematics. She works as a professor of mathematics and computer science at [[Southwestern University]] in [[Texas]].{{r|swfac}}

==Education and career==
Marr graduated from [[Murray State University]] in 2002, and earned a master's degree in mathematics at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in 2004.{{r|cv}} She completed her Ph.D. in 2007 at [[Southern Illinois University]]; her dissertation, ''Labelings of Directed Graphs'', was supervised by Walter D. Wallis.{{r|cv|mgp}}

She has been a member of the mathematics faculty at Southwestern University since 2007.{{r|cv}} She was department chair for 2015–2018. Beyond mathematics, her teaching at Southwestern has included a freshman seminar on [[game show|television game shows]].{{r|tv}}

==Contributions==
===Inquiry-based learning===
Marr is an advocate of [[inquiry-based learning]] in mathematics, a style of teaching through student research rather than through presentation of packaged solutions that is closely related to the [[Moore method]]. She was one of the founding officers of the inquiry-based learning special interest group of the [[Mathematical Association of America]], which was established in 2016.{{r|ibl}} She is an editor of the ''Journal of Inquiry-Based Learning in Mathematics'',{{r|jiblm}} and serves on the board of directors of the Initiative for Mathematics Learning By Inquiry.{{r|mli}}

===Graph theory===
With Walter Wallis, Marr is the author of a book on [[magic graph]]s and graph labeling, ''Magic Graphs'' (2nd ed., Springer, 2013).{{r|magic}} She spoke about magic graph labelings as an invited speaker at the Midwest Conference on Combinatorics, Cryptography, and Computing in 2011.{{r|mwc4}}

  |title=Aristotle's Demonstrative Logic

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally, the terminology evolved. 
==Argument==
An '''[[argument]]''', more fully a premise-conclusion argument, is a two-part system composed of premises and conclusion. An argument is [[Validity (logic)|''valid'']] [[if and only if]] its conclusion is a [[Logical consequence|consequence]] of its premises. Every premise set has infinitely many consequences each giving rise to a valid argument. Some consequences are obviously so but most are not: most are hidden consequences. Most valid arguments are not yet known to be valid. To determine validity in non-obvious cases deductive reasoning is required. There is no deductive reasoning in an argument ''per se''; such must come from the outside. 

Every argument's conclusion is a premise of other arguments. The word ''constituent'' may be used for either a premise or conclusion.In the context of this article and in most classical contexts, all candidates for consideration as argument constituents fall under the category of [[truth-bearer]]: propositions, statements, sentences, judgments, etc.

==Deduction==
A '''deduction''' is a three-part system composed of premises, a conclusion, and chain of intermediates — steps of reasoning showing that its conclusion is a [[logical consequence|consequence]] of its premises. The reasoning in a deduction is by definition cogent. Such reasoning itself, or the chain of intermediates representing it, has also been called an argument, more fully a [[deductive argument]]. In many cases, an argument can be known to be valid by means of a deduction of its conclusion from its premises but non-deductive methods such as [[Venn diagrams]] and other graphic procedures have been proposed.

==Proof==
A '''[[Formal proof|proof]]''' is a deduction whose premises are known truths. A [[Mathematical proof|proof]] of the [[Pythagorean theorem]] is a deduction that might use several premises — [[axiom]]s, postulates, and definitions — and contain dozens of intermediate steps. As [[Alfred Tarski]] famously emphasized in accord with [[Aristotle]], truths can be known by proof but proofs presuppose truths not known by proof.
==Comparison==
Premise-conclusion arguments do not require or produce either knowledge of validity or knowledge of truth. Premise sets may be chosen arbitrarily and conclusions may be chosen arbitrarily. 
Deductions require knowing how to reason but they do not require knowledge of truth of their premises. Deductions produce knowledge of the validity of arguments but ordinarily they do not produce knowledge of the truth of their conclusions.
Proofs require knowledge of the truth of their premises, they require knowledge of deductive reasoning, and they produce knowledge of their conclusions.
==Context==
Modern logicians disagree concerning the nature of argument constituents.[[Willard Van Orman Quine| Quine]] devotes the first chapter of ''Philosophy of Logic'' to this issue.&lt;ref&gt;WILLARD QUINE, ''Philosophy of logic'', Harvard, 1970/1986. &lt;/ref&gt; Historians have not even been able to agree on what [[Aristotle]] took as constituents.&lt;ref&gt; JOHN CORCORAN, Aristotle's syllogistic premises. Bulletin of Symbolic Logic. 18 (2012) 300–1. &lt;/ref&gt;


Argument-deduction-proof distinctions are inseparable from what have been called the ''consequence-deducibility'' distinction and the ''truth-and-consequence conception of proof''.&lt;ref name=Corcoran2009/&gt; Variations among argument-deduction-proof distinctions are not all terminological.

Logician [[Alonzo Church]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
  |last=Church|first=Alonzo|authorlink=Alonzo Church
  |title=Introduction to Mathematical Logic
  |publisher=Princeton University Press
  |year=1956
|isbn=9780691029061}}&lt;/ref&gt; never used the word ''argument'' in the above sense and had no synonym. Moreover, Church never explained that deduction is the process of producing knowledge of consequence and it never used the common noun ''deduction'' for an application of the deduction process. His primary focus in discussing proof was “conviction” produced by generation of chains of logical truths—not the much more widely applicable and more familiar general process of demonstration as found in pre-Aristotelian geometry and discussed by Aristotle.&lt;ref name=Corcoran2009/&gt; He did discuss deductions in the above sense but not by that name: he called them awkwardly “proofs from premises” — an expression he coined for the purpose.

The absence of argument-deduction-proof distinctions is entirely consonant with Church's avowed [[Plato]]nistic logicism. Following [[Michael Dummett|Dummett's]] insightful remarks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |first=Michael|last=Dummett|authorlink=Michael Dummett

}}&lt;/ref&gt; about [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], which — ''[[mutatis mutandis]]'' — apply even more to Church, it might be possible to explain the today-surprising absence.

The theory of '''association schemes''' arose in statistics, in the theory of [[design of experiments|experimental design]] for the [[analysis of variance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bailey|2004|loc=pg. 387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bose|Mesner|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bose|Nair|1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mathematics]], association schemes belong to both [[algebra]] and [[combinatorics]]. Indeed, in [[algebraic combinatorics]], association schemes provide a unified approach to many topics, for example [[combinatorial design]]s and [[coding theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bannai|Ito|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Godsil|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In algebra, association schemes generalize [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, and the theory of association schemes generalizes the [[group character|character theory]] of [[group representation|linear representations]] of groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bailey|2004|loc=pg. 387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zieschang|2005b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zieschang|2005a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

An n-class association scheme consists of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X''  together with a [[partition of a set|partition]] ''S'' of ''X'' &amp;times; ''X'' into n + 1 [[binary relation]]s, R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;  which satisfy:

*&lt;math&gt;R_{0}=\{(x,x):x\in X\}&lt;/math&gt; and is called the [[identity relation]]. 
*Defining &lt;math&gt; R^* :=\{(x,y):(y,x)\in R\}&lt;/math&gt;, if ''R'' in ''S'', then ''R*'' in ''S''
*If &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in R_{k}&lt;/math&gt;, the number of &lt;math&gt;z\in X&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(x,z)\in R_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(z,y)\in R_{j}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant &lt;math&gt;p^k_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; depending on &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; but not on the particular choice of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.

An association scheme is ''commutative'' if &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}^k=p_{ji}^k&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Most authors assume this property.

A ''symmetric'' association scheme is one in which each relation &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; is a [[symmetric relation]]. That is:

* if (''x'',''y'')  ∈ ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, then (''y'',''x'') ∈ ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; . (Or equivalently, ''R''* = ''R''.)

Every symmetric association scheme is commutative.

Note, however, that while the notion of an association scheme generalizes the notion of a group, the notion of a commutative association scheme only generalizes the notion of a commutative group.

Two points ''x'' and ''y'' are called ''i'' th associates if &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in R_{i}&lt;/math&gt;. The definition states that if ''x'' and ''y'' are ''i'' th associates so are ''y'' and ''x''. Every pair of points are ''i'' th associates for exactly one &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. Each point is its own zeroth associate while distinct points are never zeroth associates. If ''x'' and ''y'' are ''k'' th associates then the number of points &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; which are both ''i'' th associates of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and ''j'' th associates of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is a constant &lt;math&gt;p^k_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Graph interpretation and adjacency matrices===

A symmetric association scheme can be visualized as a [[complete graph]] with labeled edges. The graph has &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; vertices, one for each point of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and the edge joining vertices &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is labeled &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; th associates. Each edge has a unique label, and the number of triangles with a fixed base labeled &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; having the other edges labeled &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is a constant &lt;math&gt;p^k_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, depending on &lt;math&gt;i,j,k&lt;/math&gt; but not on the choice of the base. In particular, each vertex is incident with exactly &lt;math&gt;p^0_{ii}=v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; edges labeled &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Adjacency relation|valency]] of the [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] &lt;math&gt;R_{i}&lt;/math&gt;. There are also loops labeled &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; at each vertex &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to &lt;math&gt;R_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]] are described by their [[Adjacency matrix|adjacency matrices]]. &lt;math&gt;A_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[adjacency matrix]] of &lt;math&gt;R_{i}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i=0,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt; and is a ''v'' &amp;times; ''v'' [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] with rows and columns labeled by the points of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\left(A_{i}\right)_{x,y}=\left\{\begin{matrix} 
1, &amp; \mbox{if } \left(x,y\right)\in R_{i},\\ 
0, &amp; \mbox{otherwise.}  \end{matrix}\right. \qquad(1)&lt;/math&gt;

The definition of a symmetric association scheme is equivalent to saying that the &lt;math&gt;A_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are ''v'' &amp;times; ''v'' (0,1)-[[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] which satisfy
:I. &lt;math&gt;A_{i} &lt;/math&gt; is symmetric,
:II. &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{n}A_{i}=J&lt;/math&gt; (the all-ones matrix),
:III. &lt;math&gt;A_{0}=I &lt;/math&gt;,
:IV. &lt;math&gt;A_{i}A_{j}=\sum_{k=0}^{n} p^k_{ij}A_{k}=A_{j}A_{i}, i,j=0,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;.

The (''x'', ''y'')-th entry of the left side of (IV) is the number of paths of length two between ''x'' and ''y'' with labels i and j in the graph. Note that the rows and columns of &lt;math&gt;A_{i}&lt;/math&gt; contain &lt;math&gt;v_{i}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;'s:

&lt;math&gt;A_{i} J=J A_{i}=v_{i} J. \qquad(2)&lt;/math&gt;

===Terminology===
*The numbers &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}^k&lt;/math&gt; are called the ''parameters'' of the scheme. They are also referred to as the ''structural constants''.

==History==
The term ''association scheme'' is due to {{harv|Bose|Shimamoto|1952}} but the concept is already inherent in {{harv|Bose|Nair|1939}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dembowski|1968|loc=pg. 281, footnote 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors were studying what statisticians have called ''partially balanced incomplete block designs'' (PBIBDs). The subject became an object of algebraic interest with the publication of {{harv|Bose|Mesner|1959}} and the introduction of the Bose–Mesner algebra. The most important contribution to the theory was the thesis of P. Delsarte {{harv|Delsarte|1973}} who recognized and fully used the connections with coding theory and design theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bannai|Ito|1984|loc=pg. vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generalizations have been studied by D. G. Higman (coherent configurations) and B. Weisfeiler (distance regular graphs).

==Basic facts==

*&lt;math&gt;p_{00}^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. if &lt;math&gt;(x,y) \in R_0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt; and the only &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(x,z) \in R_0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;z=x&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{k} p_{ii}^0 = |X|&lt;/math&gt;, this is because the &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; partition &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

==The Bose–Mesner algebra==

The [[Adjacency matrix|adjacency matrices]] &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; of the [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]] &lt;math&gt;\left(X,R_{i}\right)&lt;/math&gt; generate a [[Commutativity|commutative]] and [[associative]] [[algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; (over the real or [[complex number]]s) both for the [[matrix product]] and the [[pointwise product]]. This [[Associative algebra|associative]], [[commutative algebra]] is called the [[Bose–Mesner algebra]] of the association scheme.

Since the [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; are [[Symmetric matrix|symmetric]] and [[Commutativity|commute]] with each other, they can be [[Diagonal matrix|diagonalized]] simultaneously. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Semisimple operator|semi-simple]] and has a unique basis of primitive [[idempotent]]s &lt;math&gt;J_{0},\ldots,J_{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

There is another [[algebra]] of &lt;math&gt;\left(n+1\right)\times\left(n+1\right)&lt;/math&gt; [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] which is [[isomorphic]] to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, and is often easier to work with.

==Examples==

*The [[Johnson scheme]], denoted ''J''(''v,k''), is defined as follows.  Let ''S'' be a set with ''v'' elements.  The points of the scheme ''J''(''v'',''k'') are the &lt;math&gt;{v \choose k}&lt;/math&gt; subsets of S with ''k'' elements.  Two ''k''-element subsets ''A'', ''B'' of ''S'' are ''i'' th associates when their intersection has size ''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''i''.
*The [[Hamming scheme]], denoted ''H''(''n'',''q''), is defined as follows.  The points of ''H''(''n'',''q'') are the ''q&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' ordered ''n''-[[tuple]]s over a set of size ''q''.  Two ''n''-tuples ''x'', ''y'' are said to be ''i'' th associates if they disagree in exactly ''i'' coordinates.  E.g., if ''x'' = (1,0,1,1), ''y'' = (1,1,1,1), ''z'' = (0,0,1,1), then ''x'' and ''y'' are 1st associates, ''x'' and ''z'' are 1st associates and ''y'' and ''z'' are 2nd associates in ''H(4,2)''.
*A [[distance-regular graph]], ''G'', forms an association scheme by defining two vertices to be ''i'' th associates if their distance is ''i''.
*A [[finite group]] ''G'' yields an association scheme on &lt;math&gt;X=G&lt;/math&gt;, with a class ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; for each group element, as follows: for each &lt;math&gt;g \in G&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;R_g=\{(x,y)  |  x=g*y\}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is the group [[operation (mathematics)|operation]].   The class of the group identity is ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  This association scheme is commutative if and only if ''G'' is [[Abelian group|abelian]].
*A specific 3-class association scheme:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Street|Street|1987|loc=pg. 238}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Let ''A''(3) be the following association scheme with three associate classes on the set ''X'' = {1,2,3,4,5,6}. The (''i'',''j'') entry is ''s'' if elements ''i'' and ''j'' are in relation R&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Coding theory==

The [[Hamming scheme]] and the [[Johnson scheme]] are of major significance in classical [[coding theory]].

In [[coding theory]], association scheme theory is mainly concerned with the [[Hamming distance|distance]] of a [[code]].  The [[linear programming]] method produces upper bounds for the size of a [[code]] with given minimum [[Hamming distance|distance]], and lower bounds for the size of a [[T-design|design]] with a given strength. The most specific results are obtained in the case where the underlying association scheme satisfies certain [[polynomial]] properties; this leads one into the realm of [[orthogonal polynomials]]. In particular, some universal bounds are derived for [[code]]s and [[T-design|designs]] in polynomial-type association schemes.

In classical [[coding theory]], dealing with [[code]]s in a [[Hamming scheme]], the MacWilliams transform involves a family of orthogonal polynomials known as the [[Krawtchouk polynomials]]. These polynomials give the [[eigenvalues]] of the distance relation [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] of the [[Hamming scheme]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4067">[[Image:Biholomorphism illustration.svg|right|thumb|The complex [[exponential function]] mapping biholomorphically a rectangle to a quarter-[[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]].]]
In the [[mathematics|mathematical theory]] of functions of [[complex analysis|one]] or [[several complex variables|more complex variables]], and also in [[complex algebraic geometry]], a '''biholomorphism''' or '''biholomorphic function''' is a [[bijective]] [[holomorphic function]] whose [[inverse function|inverse]] is also [[holomorphic function| holomorphic]].
==Formal definition==
Formally, a ''biholomorphic function'' is a function &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; defined on an [[open subset]] ''U'' of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional complex space '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with values in '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; which is [[holomorphic function| holomorphic]]  and [[bijective function|one-to-one]], such that its [[image (mathematics)|image]] is an open set &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; in '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and the inverse &lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}:V\to U&lt;/math&gt; is also [[holomorphic function| holomorphic]]. More generally, ''U'' and ''V'' can be [[complex manifold]]s. As in the case of functions of a single complex variable, a sufficient condition for a holomorphic map to be biholomorphic onto its image is that the map is injective, in which case the inverse is also holomorphic (e.g., see Gunning 1990, Theorem I.11).

If there exists a biholomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi \colon U \to V&lt;/math&gt;, we say that ''U'' and ''V'' are '''biholomorphically equivalent''' or that they are '''biholomorphic'''.

==Riemann mapping theorem and generalizations==
If &lt;math&gt;n=1,&lt;/math&gt; every [[simply connected]] open set other than the whole complex plane is biholomorphic to the [[unit disc]] (this is the [[Riemann mapping theorem]]). The situation is very different in higher dimensions. For example, open [[unit ball]]s and open unit [[polydisc]]s are not biholomorphically equivalent for &lt;math&gt;n&gt;1.&lt;/math&gt; In fact, there does not exist even a [[Proper map|proper]] holomorphic function from one to the other.

==Alternative definitions==
In the case of maps ''f'' : ''U'' → '''C''' defined on an open subset ''U'' of the complex plane '''C''', some authors (e.g., Freitag 2009, Definition IV.4.1) define a [[conformal map]] to be an injective map with nonzero derivative i.e., ''f''’(''z'')≠ 0 for every ''z'' in ''U''. According to this definition, a map ''f'' : ''U'' → '''C''' is conformal if and only if ''f'': ''U'' → ''f''(''U'') is biholomorphic.  Other authors (e.g., Conway 1978) define a conformal map as one with nonzero derivative, without requiring that the map be injective. According to this weaker definition of conformality, a conformal map need not be biholomorphic even though it is locally biholomorphic. For example, if ''f'': ''U'' → ''U'' is defined by ''f''(''z'') = ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with ''U'' = '''C'''–{0}, then ''f'' is conformal on ''U'', since its derivative ''f''’(''z'') = 2''z'' ≠ 0, but it is not biholomorphic, since it is 2-1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1971">In [[sub-Riemannian geometry]], the '''Chow–Rashevskii theorem''' (also known as '''Chow's theorem''')  asserts that any two points of a connected sub-Riemannian manifold are connected by a horizontal path in the manifold.  It is named after [[Wei-Liang Chow]] who proved it in [[#CITEREFChow1939|1939]], and [[Petr Konstanovich Rashevskii]], who proved it independently in [[#CITEREFRashevskii1938|1938]].

The theorem has a number of equivalent statements, one of which is that the [[topology]] induced by the [[Carnot–Carathéodory metric]] is equivalent to the intrinsic (locally Euclidean) topology of the manifold.  A stronger statement that implies the theorem is the [[ball&amp;ndash;box theorem]].  See, for instance, {{harvtxt|Montgomery|2006}} and {{harvtxt|Gromov|1996}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4946">In [[differential geometry]], especially the theory of space curves, the '''Darboux vector''' is the [[angular velocity]] [[vector (geometric)|vector]] of the [[Frenet-Serret formulas|Frenet frame]] of a space curve.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Differential Geometry|volume=20|series=Pure and applied mathematics|first=J.

In terms of the Frenet-Serret apparatus, the Darboux vector '''ω''' can be expressed as&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Differential Geometry and Its Applications|series=Mathematical Association of America Textbooks|first=John|last=Oprea|publisher=MAA|year=2007|isbn=9780883857489|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xb48zk0wJfIC&amp;pg=PA21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\omega} = \tau \mathbf{T} + \kappa \mathbf{B} \qquad \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;
and it has the following [[symmetry|symmetrical]] properties:&lt;ref name="phc"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{T} = \mathbf{T'}, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{N} = \mathbf{N'}, &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{B'}, &lt;/math&gt;
which can be derived from Equation (1) by means of the [[Frenet-Serret formulas|Frenet-Serret theorem]] (or vice versa).

Let a rigid object move along a regular curve described parametrically by '''β'''(''t'').  This object has its own intrinsic [[coordinate system]].  As the object moves along the curve, let its intrinsic coordinate system keep itself aligned with the curve's Frenet frame.  As it does so, the object's motion will be described by two vectors: a translation vector, and a [[rotation vector]] '''ω''', which is an areal velocity vector: the Darboux vector.

Note that this rotation is [[kinematics|kinematic]], rather than physical, because usually when a rigid object moves freely in space its rotation is independent of its translation.  The exception would be if the object's rotation is physically constrained to align itself with the object's translation, as is the case with the cart of a [[roller coaster]].

Consider the rigid object moving smoothly along the regular curve.  Once the translation is "factored out", the object is seen to rotate the same way as its Frenet frame.  The total rotation of the Frenet frame is the combination of the rotations of each of the three Frenet vectors:
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\omega} = \boldsymbol{\omega}_\mathbf{T} + \boldsymbol{\omega}_\mathbf{N} + \boldsymbol{\omega}_\mathbf{B}. &lt;/math&gt;

Each Frenet vector moves about an "origin" which is the centre of the rigid object (pick some point within the object and call it its centre).  The areal velocity of the tangent vector is:
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\omega}_\mathbf{T} = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} {\mathbf{T}(t) \times \mathbf{T}(t + \Delta t) \over 2 \, \Delta t} &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = {\mathbf{T}(t) \times \mathbf{T'}(t) \over 2}. &lt;/math&gt;

Likewise,
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\omega}_\mathbf{N} = {1 \over 2} \ \mathbf{N}(t) \times \mathbf{N'}(t), &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\omega}_\mathbf{B} = {1 \over 2} \ \mathbf{B}(t) \times \mathbf{B'}(t). &lt;/math&gt;

Now apply the Frenet-Serret theorem to find the areal velocity components:
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\omega}_\mathbf{T} = {1\over 2} \mathbf{T} \times \mathbf{T'} = {1\over 2}\kappa \mathbf{T} \times \mathbf{N} = {1\over 2}\kappa \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\omega}_\mathbf{N} = {1\over 2}\mathbf{N} \times \mathbf{N'} = {1\over 2}(-\kappa \mathbf{N} \times \mathbf{T} + \tau \mathbf{N} \times \mathbf{B}) = {1\over 2}(\kappa \mathbf{B} + \tau \mathbf{T}) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\omega}_\mathbf{B} = {1\over 2}\mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{B'} = -{1\over 2}\tau \mathbf{B} \times \mathbf{N} = {1\over 2}\tau \mathbf{T} &lt;/math&gt;
so that 

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\omega} = {1\over 2}\kappa \mathbf{B} + {1\over 2}(\kappa \mathbf{B} + \tau \mathbf{T}) + {1\over 2}\tau \mathbf{T} = \kappa \mathbf{B} + \tau \mathbf{T}, &lt;/math&gt;
as claimed.

The Darboux vector provides a concise way of interpreting [[curvature]] ''κ'' and [[Torsion of a curve|torsion]] ''τ'' geometrically: curvature is the measure of the rotation of the Frenet frame about the binormal unit vector, whereas torsion is the measure of the rotation of the Frenet frame about the tangent unit vector.&lt;ref name="phc"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13790">{{Calculus |Differential}}

This is a summary of '''differentiation rules''', that is, rules for computing the [[derivative]] of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] in [[calculus]].

== Elementary rules of differentiation ==

Unless otherwise stated, all functions are functions of [[real number|real numbers ('''R''')]] that return real values; although more generally, the formulae below apply wherever they are [[well defined]]&lt;ref&gt;''Calculus (5th edition)'', F. Ayres, E. Mendelson, Schaum's Outline Series, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-07-150861-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Advanced Calculus (3rd edition)'', R. Wrede, M.R. Spiegel, Schaum's Outline Series, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-07-162366-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;—including [[complex number|complex numbers ('''C''')]].&lt;ref&gt;''Complex Variables'', M.R. Speigel, S. Lipschutz, J.J. Schiller, D. Spellman, Schaum's Outlines Series, McGraw Hill (USA), 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-07-161569-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differentiation is linear===
 
{{main|Linearity of differentiation}}

For any functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and any real numbers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; the derivative of the function &lt;math&gt;h(x) = af(x) + bg(x)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; h'(x) = a f'(x) + b g'(x).&lt;/math&gt;

In [[Leibniz's notation]] this is written as:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d(af+bg)}{dx}  = a\frac{df}{dx} +b\frac{dg}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

Special cases include:

* ''The [[Constant factor rule in differentiation|constant factor
 rule]]''
:&lt;math&gt;(af)' = af' &lt;/math&gt;
* ''The [[Sum rule in differentiation|sum rule]]''
:&lt;math&gt;(f + g)' = f' + g'&lt;/math&gt;
* ''The subtraction rule''
:&lt;math&gt;(f - g)' = f' - g'.&lt;/math&gt;

===The product rule===

{{main|Product rule}}

For the functions ''f'' and ''g'', the derivative of the function ''h''(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') ''g''(''x'')
with respect to ''x'' is
:&lt;math&gt; h'(x) = (f(x) g(x))' = f'(x) g(x) + f(x) g'(x).&lt;/math&gt;
In Leibniz's notation this is written
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d(fg)}{dx} = \frac{df}{dx} g + f \frac{dg}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

===The chain rule===

{{main|Chain rule}}

The derivative of the function &lt;math&gt;h(x) = f(g(x))&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; h'(x) = (f(g(x)))' = f'(g(x))\cdot g'(x).&lt;/math&gt;

In Leibniz's notation this is correctly written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}h(x) = \frac{d}{dz}f(z)|_{z=g(x)}\cdot \frac{d}{dx}g(x),&lt;/math&gt; 

often abridged to &lt;math&gt;\quad\frac{dh(x)}{dx} = \frac{df(g(x))}{dg(x)}\cdot \frac{dg(x)}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;
Focusing on the notion of maps, and the differential being a map &lt;math&gt;\text{D}&lt;/math&gt;, this is written in a more concise way as:

:&lt;math&gt; [\text{D} (h\circ g)]_x = [\text{D} h]_{g(x)} \cdot [\text{D}g]_x\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===The inverse function rule===

{{main|inverse functions and differentiation}}

If the function ''f'' has an [[inverse function]] ''g'', meaning that {{nowrap|1=''g''(''f''(''x'')) = ''x''}} and {{nowrap|1=''f''(''g''(''y'')) = ''y''}}, then
:&lt;math&gt;g' = \frac{1}{f'\circ g}.&lt;/math&gt;

In Leibniz notation, this is written as
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dx}{dy} = \frac{1}{\frac{dy}{dx}}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Power laws, polynomials, quotients, and reciprocals==
===The polynomial or elementary power rule===

{{main|Power rule}}

If &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^r&lt;/math&gt;, for any real number &lt;math&gt;r \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; then 
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x) = rx^{r-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Special cases include:
* If ''f''(''x'') = ''x'', then ''f′''(''x'') = 1.  This special case may be generalized to:
*:''The derivative of an affine function is constant'': if ''f''(''x'') = ''ax'' + ''b'', then ''f′''(''x'') = ''a''.

Combining this rule with the linearity of the derivative and the addition rule permits the computation of the derivative of any polynomial.

===The reciprocal rule===

{{main|Reciprocal rule}}
The derivative of ''h''(''x'') = 1/''f''(''x'') for any (nonvanishing) function ''f'' is:

:&lt;math&gt; h'(x) = -\frac{f'(x)}{(f(x))^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

In Leibniz's notation, this is written

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d(1/f)}{dx} = -\frac{1}{f^2}\frac{df}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

The reciprocal rule can be derived from the quotient rule.

===The quotient rule===
{{main|Quotient rule}}
If ''f'' and ''g'' are functions, then:
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)' = \frac{f'g - g'f}{g^2}\quad&lt;/math&gt; wherever ''g'' is nonzero.
This can be derived from the product rule.

===Generalized power rule===

{{main|Power rule}}

The elementary power rule generalizes considerably. The most general power rule is the '''functional power rule''': for any functions ''f'' and ''g'',
:&lt;math&gt;(f^g)' = \left(e^{g\ln f}\right)' = f^g\left(f'{g \over f} + g'\ln f\right),\quad&lt;/math&gt;
wherever both sides are well defined.

Special cases:
* If ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''a''&lt;/sup&gt;, ''f′''(''x'') = ''ax''&lt;sup&gt;''a'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt; when ''a'' is any non-zero real number and ''x'' is positive.
* The reciprocal rule may be derived as the special case where ''g''(''x'') = −1.

== Derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions ==

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\left(c^{ax}\right) = {c^{ax} \ln c \cdot a } ,\qquad c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
note that the equation above is true for all ''c'', but the derivative for c &lt; 0 yields a complex number.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\left(e^{ax}\right) = ae^{ax}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\left( \log_c x\right) = {1 \over x \ln c} , \qquad c &gt; 0, c \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;
the equation above is also true for all ''c'' but yields a complex number if c&lt;0.

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\left( \ln x\right)  = {1 \over x} ,\qquad x &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\left( \ln |x|\right) = {1 \over x}.&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\left( x^x \right) = x^x(1+\ln x).&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\left( f(x)^{ g(x) } \right ) = g(x)f(x)^{g(x)-1} \frac{df}{dx} + f(x)^{g(x)}\ln{( f(x) )}\frac{dg}{dx}, \qquad \text{if }f(x) &gt; 0, \text{ and if } \frac{df}{dx} \text{ and } \frac{dg}{dx} \text{ exist.}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx}\left( f_{1}(x)^{f_{2}(x)^{\left ( ... \right )^{f_{n}(x)}}} \right ) = \left [\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} \frac{\partial }{\partial x_{k}} \left( f_{1}(x_1)^{f_{2}(x_2)^{\left ( ... \right )^{f_{n}(x_n)}}} \right ) \right ] \biggr\vert_{x_1 = x_2 = ... =x_n = x}, \text{ if } f_{i&lt;n}(x) &gt; 0 \text{ and }&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \frac{df_{i}}{dx} \text{ exists. }&lt;/math&gt;
===Logarithmic derivatives===

The [[logarithmic derivative]] is another way of stating the rule for differentiating the [[logarithm]] of a function (using the chain rule):
:&lt;math&gt; (\ln f)'= \frac{f'}{f} \quad&lt;/math&gt; wherever ''f'' is positive.

[[Logarithmic differentiation]] is a technique which uses logarithms and its differentiation rules to simplify certain expressions before actually applying the derivative.
Logarithms can be used to remove exponents, convert products into sums, and convert division into subtraction, each of which may lead to a simplified expression for taking derivatives.

It is common to additionally define an inverse tangent function with two arguments, &lt;math&gt;\arctan(y,x)&lt;/math&gt;.  Its value lies in the range &lt;math&gt;[-\pi,\pi]&lt;/math&gt; and reflects the quadrant of the point &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Derivatives of integrals==

{{main|Differentiation under the integral sign}}

Suppose that it is required to differentiate with respect to ''x'' the function

:&lt;math&gt;F(x)=\int_{a(x)}^{b(x)}f(x,t)\,dt,&lt;/math&gt;

where the functions &lt;math&gt;f(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\,f(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; are both continuous in both &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in some region of the &lt;math&gt;(t,x)&lt;/math&gt; plane, including &lt;math&gt;a(x)\leq t\leq b(x),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;x_0\leq x\leq x_1&lt;/math&gt;, and the functions &lt;math&gt;a(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b(x)&lt;/math&gt; are both continuous and both have continuous derivatives for &lt;math&gt;x_0\leq x\leq x_1&lt;/math&gt;.  Then for &lt;math&gt;\,x_0\leq x\leq x_1&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; F'(x) = f(x,b(x))\,b'(x) - f(x,a(x))\,a'(x) + \int_{a(x)}^{b(x)} \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\, f(x,t)\; dt\,. &lt;/math&gt;

This formula is the general form of the [[Leibniz integral rule]] and can be derived using the 
[[fundamental theorem of calculus]].

==Derivatives to ''n''th order==
Some rules exist for computing the ''n''th derivative of functions, where ''n'' is a positive integer.  These include:

===Faà di Bruno's formula===
{{main|Faà di Bruno's formula}}
If ''f'' and ''g'' are ''n'' times differentiable, then

:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{d^n}{d x^n} [f(g(x))]= n! \sum_{\{k_m\}}^{} f^{(r)}(g(x)) \prod_{m=1}^n \frac{1}{k_m!} \left(g^{(m)}(x) \right)^{k_m}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; r = \sum_{m=1}^{n-1} k_m&lt;/math&gt; and the set &lt;math&gt; \{k_m\}&lt;/math&gt; consists of all non-negative integer solutions of the Diophantine equation &lt;math&gt; \sum_{m=1}^{n} m k_m = n&lt;/math&gt;.

===General Leibniz rule===
{{main|General Leibniz rule}}
If ''f'' and ''g'' are ''n'' times differentiable, then

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^n}{dx^n}[f(x)g(x)] = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} \frac{d^{n-k}}{d x^{n-k}} f(x) \frac{d^k}{d x^k} g(x)&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2831">In [[mathematics]], the '''Feit–Thompson conjecture''' is a  [[conjecture]] in [[number theory]], suggested by  {{harvs|txt=yes|first=Walter|last= Feit|authorlink=Walter Feit| first2=John G. |last2=Thompson|author2-link=John G. Thompson|year=1962}}. The conjecture states that there are no distinct [[prime number]]s ''p'' and ''q'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p^{q} - 1}{p - 1}&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;\frac{q^{p} - 1}{q - 1}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the conjecture were true, it would greatly simplify the final chapter of the  proof {{harv|Feit|Thompson|1963}} of the [[Feit–Thompson theorem]] that every finite [[group (mathematics)|group]] of odd [[order (group theory)|order]] is [[solvable group|solvable]].  A stronger conjecture that the two numbers are always [[coprime]] was disproved  by {{harvtxt|Stephens|1971}} with the [[counterexample]] ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;17 and ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3313 with [[common factor]] 2''pq''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;112643.

It is known that the conjecture is true for ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;{{harv|Le|2012}}.

Informal [[probability]] arguments suggest that the "expected" number of counterexamples to the Feit–Thompson conjecture is very close to 0, suggesting that the Feit–Thompson conjecture is likely to be true.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8237">The '''forking lemma''' is any of a number of related [[lemma (mathematics)|lemmas]] in [[cryptography]] research.  The lemma states that if an adversary (typically a [[probabilistic Turing machine]]), on inputs drawn from some [[Probability distribution|distribution]], produces an output that has some property with [[negligible function|non-negligible]] [[probability]], then with non-negligible probability, if the adversary is re-run on new inputs but with the same [[random tape]], its second output will also have the property.

This concept was first used by [[David Pointcheval]] and [[Jacques Stern]] in "Security proofs for signature schemes," published in the proceedings of [[Eurocrypt]] 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Brickell]], [[David Pointcheval]], [[Serge Vaudenay]], and [[Moti Yung]], "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/8v8btpfkat5qp3da/?p=2ad4ec3d6e8447a28d44bd3922e75ef8&amp;pi=18 Design Validations for Discrete Logarithm Based Signature Schemes]", Third International Workshop on Practice and Theory in Public Key Cryptosystems, PKC 2000, [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], January 18&amp;ndash;20, 2000, pp. 276&amp;ndash;292.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="YoungYung"&gt;Adam Young and Moti Yung, "Malicious Cryptography: Exposing Cryptovirology", Wiley press, 2004, pp. 344.&lt;/ref&gt;  In their paper, the forking lemma is specified in terms of an adversary that attacks a [[digital signature]] scheme instantiated in the [[random oracle]] model.  They show that if an adversary can forge a signature with non-negligible probability, then there is a non-negligible probability that the same adversary with the same random tape can create a second forgery in an attack with a different random oracle.&lt;ref&gt;David Pointcheval and [[Jacques Stern]], "[http://www.springerlink.com/content/k0xj74fcvnaj202t/?p=f5b8f4cb35e149ceb402fb89549556f1&amp;pi=32 Security Proofs for Signature Schemes]", Advances in Cryptology &amp;mdash; EUROCRYPT '96, [[Saragossa]], [[Spain]], May 12&amp;ndash;16, 1996, pp. 387&amp;ndash;398.&lt;/ref&gt;  The forking lemma was later generalized by [[Mihir Bellare]] and Gregory Neven.&lt;ref name="BellareNeven"&gt;[[Mihir Bellare]] and Gregory Neven, "[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1180453 Multi-Signatures in the Plain Public-Key Model and a General Forking Lemma]", Proceedings of the 13th [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) Conference on Computer and 
Communications Security (CCS), [[Alexandria, Virginia]], 2006, pp. 390&amp;ndash;399.&lt;/ref&gt;   The forking lemma has been used to prove the security of a variety of digital signature schemes and other random-oracle based cryptographic constructions.&lt;ref name="YoungYung" /&gt;

==Statement of the lemma==

The generalized version of the lemma is stated as follows.&lt;ref name="BellareNeven" /&gt;  Let ''A'' be a probabilistic algorithm, with inputs (''x'', ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;; ''r'') that outputs a pair (''J'', ''y''), where ''r'' refers to the random tape of ''A'' (that is, the random choices A will make).  Suppose '''further''' that ''IG'' is a probability distribution from which ''x'' is drawn, and that ''H'' is a set of size ''h'' from which each of the ''h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' values are drawn according to the [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniform distribution]].  Let acc be the probability that on inputs distributed as described, the ''J'' output by ''A'' is greater than or equal to 1.

We can then define a "forking algorithm" ''F&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' that proceeds as follows, on input ''x'':
# Pick a random tape ''r'' for ''A''.
# Pick ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; uniformly from ''H''.
# Run ''A'' on input (''x'', ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;; ''r'') to produce (''J'', ''y'').
# If ''J'' = 0, then return (0, 0, 0).
# Pick ''h'&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., h'&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;'' uniformly from ''H''.
# Run ''A'' on input (''x'', ''h''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''h''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;; ''r'') to produce (''J''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;, ''y''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;).
# If ''J' '' = ''J'' and ''h&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ ''h'&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' then return (1, ''y'', ''y''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;), otherwise, return (0, 0, 0).

Let frk be the probability that ''F&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' outputs a triple starting with 1, given an input ''x'' chosen randomly from ''IG''.  Then

: &lt;math&gt;\text{frk} \geq \text{acc} \cdot \left ( \frac{\text{acc}}{q} - \frac{1}{h} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

===Intuition===

The idea here is to think of ''A'' as running two times in related executions, where the process "[[Fork (software development)|forks]]" at a certain point, when some but not all of the input has been examined.  In the alternate version, the remaining inputs are re-generated but are generated in the normal way.  The point at which the process forks may be something we only want to decide later, possibly based on the behavior of ''A'' the first time around: this is why the lemma statement chooses the branching point (''J'') based on the output of ''A''.   The requirement that ''h&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≠ ''h'&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a technical one required by many uses of the lemma.  (Note that since both ''h&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''h'&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'' are chosen randomly from ''H'', then if ''h'' is large, which would be normal, the probability of the two values not being distinct is extremely small.)

===Example===

For example, let ''A'' be an algorithm for breaking a [[digital signature]] scheme in the [[random oracle]] model.  Then ''x'' would be the public parameters (including the public key) ''A'' is attacking, and ''h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' would be the output of the random oracle on its ''i''th distinct input.  The forking lemma is of use when it would be possible, given two different random signatures of the same message, to solve some underlying hard problem.  An adversary that forges once, however, gives rise to one that forges twice on the same message with non-negligible probability through the forking lemma.  When ''A'' attempts to forge on a message ''m'', we consider the output of ''A'' to be (''J'', ''y'') where ''y'' is the forgery, and ''J'' is such that ''m'' was the ''J''th unique query to the random oracle (it may be assumed that ''A'' will query ''m'' at some point, if ''A'' is to be successful with non-negligible probability).  (If ''A'' outputs an incorrect forgery, we consider the output to be (0, ''y'').)

By the forking lemma, the probability (''frk'') of obtaining two good forgeries ''y'' and ''y' '' on  the same message but with different random oracle outputs (that is, with ''h&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ h'&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;'') is non-negligible when ''acc'' is also non-negligible.  This allows us to prove that if the underlying hard problem is indeed hard, then no adversary can forge signatures.

This is the essence of the proof given by Pointcheval and Stern for a modified [[ElGamal signature scheme]] against an adaptive adversary.

==Known issues with application of forking lemma==
The reduction provided by the forking lemma is not a tight reduction. Pointcheval and Stern proposed security arguments for Digital Signatures and Blind Signature using Forking Lemma.&lt;ref&gt;David Pointcheval and Jacques Stern, "Security Arguments for Digital Signatures and Blind Signatures," ''JOURNAL OF CRYPTOLOGY'', Volume 13, pp 361--396, 2000. [http://www.di.ens.fr/~pointche/pub.php Available on Internet].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claus P. Schnorr]] provided an attack on blind Schnorr signatures schemes,&lt;ref&gt;C.P.Schnorr, "Security of Blind Discrete Log Signatures Against Interactive Attacks," ''Proceedings of ICICS 2001,'' [http://www.springerlink.com/content/wtykch59xl2r/ LNCS Vol. 2229], pp 1-13, 2001. [http://www.mi.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/research/papers.html Available on Internet].&lt;/ref&gt; which were argued to be secure by Pointcheval and Stern. Schnorr also suggested enhancements for securing blind signatures schemes based on [[discrete logarithm]] problem.&lt;ref&gt;C.P. Schnorr, "Enhancing the security of perfect blind DL-signatures," Information Sciences, Elsevier, Vol. 176, pp 1305--1320, 2006. [http://www.mi.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/research/papers.html Available on Internet]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[symplectic topology]], '''Gromov's compactness theorem''' states that a sequence of [[pseudoholomorphic curve|pseudoholomorphic]] curves in an [[almost complex manifold]] with a uniform energy bound must have a subsequence which limits to a pseudoholomorphic curve which may have nodes or (a finite tree of) "bubbles".  A bubble is a holomorphic sphere which has a transverse intersection with the rest of the curve.  This theorem, and its generalizations to punctured pseudoholomorphic curves, underlies the compactness results for flow lines in [[Floer homology]] and [[symplectic field theory]].

If the complex structures on the curves in the sequence do not vary, only bubbles can occur; nodes can occur only if the complex structures on the domain are allowed to vary.  Usually, the energy bound is achieved by considering a symplectic manifold with compatible almost-complex structure as the target, and assuming that curves to lie in a fixed homology class in the target.  This is because the energy of such a pseudoholomorphic curve is given by the integral of the target symplectic form over the curve, and thus by evaluating the cohomology class of that symplectic form on the homology class of the curve.  The finiteness of the bubble tree follows from (positive) lower bounds on the energy contributed by a holomorphic sphere.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9878">In [[mathematics]], the '''Hahn decomposition theorem''', named after the [[Austria]]n [[mathematician]] [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], states that for any [[sigma-algebra|measurable space]] &lt;math&gt; (X,\Sigma) &lt;/math&gt; and any [[signed measure]] &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; defined on the &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;-algebra &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt;, there exist two &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt;-measurable sets, &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt;, of &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; such that:

# &lt;math&gt; P \cup N = X &lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; P \cap N = \varnothing &lt;/math&gt;.
# For every &lt;math&gt; E \in \Sigma &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; E \subseteq P &lt;/math&gt;, one has &lt;math&gt; \mu(E) \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; is a [[positive and negative sets|positive set]] for &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;.
# For every &lt;math&gt; E \in \Sigma &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; E \subseteq N &lt;/math&gt;, one has &lt;math&gt; \mu(E) \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; is a negative set for &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;.

Moreover, this decomposition is [[universal property|essentially unique]], meaning that for any other pair &lt;math&gt; (P',N') &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt;-measurable subsets of &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; fulfilling the three conditions above, the [[symmetric difference]]s &lt;math&gt; P \triangle P' &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; N \triangle N' &lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;-[[null set]]s in the strong sense that every &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt;-measurable subset of them has zero measure. The pair &lt;math&gt; (P,N) &lt;/math&gt; is then called a ''Hahn decomposition'' of the signed measure &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;.

== Jordan measure decomposition ==

A consequence of the Hahn decomposition theorem is the '''Jordan decomposition theorem''', which states that every signed measure &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; defined on &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt; has a ''unique'' decomposition into a difference &lt;math&gt; \mu = \mu^{+} - \mu^{-} &lt;/math&gt; of two positive measures, &lt;math&gt; \mu^{+} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mu^{-} &lt;/math&gt;, at least one of which is finite, such that &lt;math&gt; {\mu^{+}}(E) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt;-measurable subset &lt;math&gt; E \subseteq N &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; {\mu^{-}}(E) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt;-measurable subset &lt;math&gt; E \subseteq P &lt;/math&gt;, for any Hahn decomposition &lt;math&gt; (P,N) &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;. We call &lt;math&gt; \mu^{+} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mu^{-} &lt;/math&gt; the ''positive'' and ''negative part'' of &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;, respectively. The pair &lt;math&gt; (\mu^{+},\mu^{-}) &lt;/math&gt; is called a ''Jordan decomposition'' (or sometimes ''Hahn–Jordan decomposition'') of &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;. The two measures can be defined as

:&lt;math&gt; {\mu^{+}}(E) := \mu(E \cap P) \qquad \text{and} \qquad {\mu^{-}}(E) := - \mu(E \cap N) &lt;/math&gt;

for every &lt;math&gt; E \in \Sigma &lt;/math&gt; and any Hahn decomposition &lt;math&gt; (P,N) &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the Jordan decomposition is unique, while the Hahn decomposition is only essentially unique.

The Jordan decomposition has the following corollary: Given a Jordan decomposition &lt;math&gt; (\mu^{+},\mu^{-}) &lt;/math&gt; of a finite signed measure &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;, one has

:&lt;math&gt; {\mu^{+}}(E) = \sup_{B \in \Sigma, ~ B \subseteq E} \mu(B) \quad \text{and} \quad {\mu^{-}}(E) = - \inf_{B \in \Sigma, ~ B \subseteq E} \mu(B) &lt;/math&gt;

for any &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, if &lt;math&gt; \mu = \nu^{+} - \nu^{-} &lt;/math&gt; for a pair &lt;math&gt; (\nu^{+},\nu^{-}) &lt;/math&gt; of finite non-negative measures on &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt; \nu^{+} \geq \mu^{+} \quad \text{and} \quad \nu^{-} \geq \mu^{-}. &lt;/math&gt;

The last expression means that the Jordan decomposition is the ''minimal'' decomposition of &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; into a difference of non-negative measures. This is the ''minimality property'' of the Jordan decomposition.

'''Proof of the Jordan decomposition:''' For an elementary proof of the existence, uniqueness, and minimality of the Jordan measure decomposition see [https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5449 Fischer (2012)].

== Proof of the Hahn decomposition theorem ==

'''Preparation:''' Assume that &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; does not take the value &lt;math&gt; - \infty &lt;/math&gt; (otherwise decompose according to &lt;math&gt; - \mu &lt;/math&gt;). As mentioned above, a negative set is a set &lt;math&gt; A \in \Sigma &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \mu(B) \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt;-measurable subset &lt;math&gt; B \subseteq A &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Claim:''' Suppose that &lt;math&gt; D \in \Sigma &lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt; \mu(D) \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt;. Then there is a negative set &lt;math&gt; A \subseteq D &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \mu(A) \leq \mu(D) &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof of the claim:''' Define &lt;math&gt; A_{0} := D &lt;/math&gt;. [[mathematical induction|Inductively]] assume for &lt;math&gt; n \in \mathbb{N}_{0} &lt;/math&gt; that &lt;math&gt; A_{n} \subseteq D &lt;/math&gt; has been constructed. Let

:&lt;math&gt; t_{n} := \sup(\{ \mu(B) \mid B \in \Sigma ~ \text{and} ~ B \subseteq A_{n} \}) &lt;/math&gt;

denote the [[supremum]] of &lt;math&gt; \mu(B) &lt;/math&gt; over all the &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt;-measurable subsets &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; A_{n} &lt;/math&gt;. This supremum might ''a priori'' be infinite. As the empty set &lt;math&gt; \varnothing &lt;/math&gt; is a possible candidate for &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt; in the definition of &lt;math&gt; t_{n} &lt;/math&gt;, and as &lt;math&gt; \mu(\varnothing) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt; t_{n} \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;. By the definition of &lt;math&gt; t_{n} &lt;/math&gt;, there then exists a &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt;-measurable subset &lt;math&gt; B_{n} \subseteq A_{n} &lt;/math&gt; satisfying

:&lt;math&gt; \mu(B_{n}) \geq \min \! \left( 1,\frac{t_{n}}{2} \right). &lt;/math&gt;

Set &lt;math&gt; A_{n + 1} := A_{n} \setminus B_{n} &lt;/math&gt; to finish the induction step. Finally, define

:&lt;math&gt; A := D \Bigg\backslash \bigcup_{n = 0}^{\infty}  B_{n}. &lt;/math&gt;

As the sets &lt;math&gt; (B_{n})_{n = 0}^{\infty} &lt;/math&gt; are disjoint subsets of &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt;, it follows from the [[sigma additivity]] of the signed measure &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; that

:&lt;math&gt; \mu(A) = \mu(D) - \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \mu(B_{n}) \leq \mu(D) - \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \min \! \left( 1,\frac{t_{n}}{2} \right). &lt;/math&gt;

This shows that &lt;math&gt; \mu(A) \leq \mu(D) &lt;/math&gt;. Assume &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; were not a negative set. This means that there would exist a &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt;-measurable subset &lt;math&gt; B \subseteq A &lt;/math&gt; that satisfies &lt;math&gt; \mu(B) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt; t_{n} \geq \mu(B) &lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt; n \in \mathbb{N}_{0} &lt;/math&gt;, so the [[series (mathematics)|series]] on the right would have to diverge to &lt;math&gt; + \infty &lt;/math&gt;, implying that &lt;math&gt; \mu(A) = - \infty &lt;/math&gt;, which is not allowed. Therefore, &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; must be a negative set.

'''Construction of the decomposition:''' Set &lt;math&gt; N_{0} = \varnothing &lt;/math&gt;. Inductively, given &lt;math&gt; N_{n} &lt;/math&gt;, define

:&lt;math&gt; s_{n} := \inf(\{ \mu(D) \mid D \in \Sigma ~ \text{and} ~ D \subseteq X \setminus N_{n} \}). &lt;/math&gt;

as the [[infimum]] of &lt;math&gt; \mu(D) &lt;/math&gt; over all the &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt;-measurable subsets &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; X \setminus N_{n} &lt;/math&gt;. This infimum might ''a priori'' be &lt;math&gt; - \infty &lt;/math&gt;. As &lt;math&gt; \varnothing &lt;/math&gt; is a possible candidate for &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; in the definition of &lt;math&gt; s_{n} &lt;/math&gt;, and as &lt;math&gt; \mu(\varnothing) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt; s_{n} \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt;. Hence, there exists a &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt;-measurable subset &lt;math&gt; D_{n} \subseteq X \setminus N_{n} &lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt; \mu(D_{n}) \leq \max \! \left( \frac{s_{n}}{2},- 1 \right) \leq 0. &lt;/math&gt;

By the claim above, there is a negative set &lt;math&gt; A_{n} \subseteq D_{n} &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \mu(A_{n}) \leq \mu(D_{n}) &lt;/math&gt;. Set &lt;math&gt; N_{n + 1} := N_{n} \cup A_{n} &lt;/math&gt; to finish the induction step. Finally, define

:&lt;math&gt; N := \bigcup_{n = 0}^{\infty} A_{n}. &lt;/math&gt;

As the sets &lt;math&gt; (A_{n})_{n = 0}^{\infty} &lt;/math&gt; are disjoint, we have for every &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt;-measurable subset &lt;math&gt; B \subseteq N &lt;/math&gt; that

:&lt;math&gt; \mu(B) = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \mu(B \cap A_{n}) &lt;/math&gt;

by the sigma additivity of &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;. In particular, this shows that &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; is a negative set. Next, define &lt;math&gt; P := X \setminus N &lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; were not a positive set, there would exist a &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt;-measurable subset &lt;math&gt; D \subseteq P &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; \mu(D) &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt; s_{n} \leq \mu(D) &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; n \in \mathbb{N}_{0} &lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt; \mu(N) = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \mu(A_{n}) \leq \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \max \! \left( \frac{s_{n}}{2},- 1 \right) = - \infty, &lt;/math&gt;

which is not allowed for &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt; P &lt;/math&gt; is a positive set.

'''Proof of the uniqueness statement:'''
Suppose that &lt;math&gt; (N',P') &lt;/math&gt; is another Hahn decomposition of &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt; P \cap N' &lt;/math&gt;  is a positive set and also a negative set. Therefore, every measurable subset of it has measure zero. The same applies to &lt;math&gt; N \cap P' &lt;/math&gt;. As

:&lt;math&gt; P \triangle P' = N \triangle N' = (P \cap N') \cup (N \cap P'), &lt;/math&gt;

this completes the proof. [[Q.E.D.]]

==Examples==
The [[Power of two#Powers of two whose exponents are powers of two|powers of two whose exponents are powers of two]], &lt;math&gt;2^{2^n}&lt;/math&gt;, form an irrationality sequence. However, although [[Sylvester's sequence]]
:2, 3, 7, 43, 1807, 3263443, ...
(in which each term is one more than the product of all previous terms) also grows [[Double exponential function|doubly exponentially]], it does not form an irrationality sequence. For, letting &lt;math&gt;x_n=1&lt;/math&gt; gives

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{43}+\cdots=1,&lt;/math&gt;

a series converging to a rational number. Likewise, the [[factorial]]s, &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt;, do not form an irrationality sequence because the sequence &lt;math&gt;x_n=n+2&lt;/math&gt; leads to a series with a rational sum,
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+2)n!}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{30}+\frac{1}{144}+\cdots=1.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="guy"/&gt;

==Growth rate==
Any sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; that grows at a rate such that
:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_n \frac{\log\log a_n}{n} &gt; \log 2 &lt;/math&gt;
is an irrationality sequence. This includes sequences that grow at a more than doubly exponential rate as well as some doubly exponential sequences that grow more quickly than the powers of powers of two.&lt;ref name="guy"/&gt;

Every irrationality sequence must grow quickly enough that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n^{1/n}=\infty.&lt;/math&gt;
However, it is not known whether there exists such a sequence in which the [[greatest common divisor]] of each pair of terms is 1 (unlike the powers of powers of two) and for which
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n^{1/2^n}&lt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Kenneth Alan''' "'''Ken'''" '''Ribet''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɪ|b|ɪ|t}}; born June 28, 1948) is an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]], currently a professor of mathematics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. His mathematical interests include [[algebraic number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]].

==Early life and family==
Kenneth Ribet was born to parents David Ribet and Pearl Ribet on June 28, 1948. He is married to mathematician/statistician [[Lisa Goldberg]].

==Education==
As a student at [[Far Rockaway High School]], Ribet was on a competitive mathematics team, but his first field of study was chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Chapey, Dr. Geraldine. [http://www.rockawave.com/articles/chatting-with-chapey-50/ "Chatting with Chapey: Weber and Ribet Honored"], ''The Wave'', October 21, 2005. Accessed September 28, 2018. "Speaking of successful professionals, Kenneth Ribet is a world renowned scholar.... He is a proud graduate of P.S. 114, J.H.S. 210 and Far Rockaway High School."&lt;/ref&gt;
He earned his [[bachelor's degree]] and [[master's degree]] from [[Brown University]] in 1969, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1973.

==Contributions==
Ribet is credited with paving the way towards [[Andrew Wiles]]'s proof of [[Fermat's last theorem]]. Ribet proved that the ''[[epsilon conjecture]]'' formulated by [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] was true, and thereby proved that Fermat's Last Theorem would follow from the [[Taniyama–Shimura conjecture]]. Crucially it also followed that the full conjecture was not needed, but a special case, that of [[semistable elliptic curve]]s, sufficed. An earlier theorem of Ribet's, the [[Herbrand–Ribet theorem]], the converse to [[Jacques Herbrand|Herbrand]]'s theorem on the divisibility properties of [[Bernoulli number]]s, is also related to Fermat's Last Theorem.

==Awards and honors==
Ribet received the [[Fermat Prize]] in 1989 jointly with [[Abbas Bahri]].

In 1998, he received an honorary doctorate from Brown University. He was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1997 and the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 2000.

In 2012, he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is president of the [[American_Mathematical_Society#2001.E2.80.93present|American Mathematical Society]] from February 1, 2017 to January 31, 2019.

In 2017,  Ribet received the [[Brouwer Medal]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1769">In [[mathematics]], '''Kummer's theorem''' for binomial coefficients gives the [[p-adic valuation|''p''-adic valuation]] of a [[binomial coefficient]], i.e., the exponent of the highest power of a [[prime number]] ''p'' dividing this binomial coefficient. The theorem is named after [[Ernst Kummer]], who proved it in the paper {{harvtxt|Kummer|1852}}.

==Statement==
Kummer's theorem states that for given [[integer]]s ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 and a prime number ''p'', the ''p''-adic valuation &lt;math&gt;\nu_p\left( \tbinom n m \right)&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the number of [[carry (arithmetic)|carries]] when ''m'' is added to ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''m'' in [[radix|base]]&amp;nbsp;''p''.

It can be proved by writing &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{m}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{n!}{m! (n-m)!}&lt;/math&gt; and using [[Legendre's formula]].

==Multinomial coefficient generalization==
Kummer's theorem may be generalized to [[multinomial coefficient]]s &lt;math&gt; \tbinom n {m_1,\ldots,m_k} := \tfrac{n!}{m_1!\cdots m_k!}&lt;/math&gt; as follows: Write the base-&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; expansion of an integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n=n_0+n_1p+n_2p^2+\cdots+n_rp^r&lt;/math&gt;, and define &lt;math&gt;S_p(n)=n_0+n_1+\cdots+n_r&lt;/math&gt; to be the sum of the base-&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; digits. Then

&lt;math&gt;\nu_p\left( \dbinom n {m_1,\ldots,m_k} \right) = \dfrac{1}{p-1} \left( \sum_{i=1}^k S_p(m_i) - S_p(n)\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[mathematics]], '''Liouville's theorem''', proved by [[Joseph Liouville]] in [[#CITEREFMonge1850|1850]], is a [[rigidity (mathematics)|rigidity]] theorem about [[conformal mapping]]s in [[Euclidean space]]. It states that any [[smooth function|smooth]] conformal mapping on a domain of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2, can be expressed as a composition of [[translation (geometry)|translations]], [[similarity (geometry)|similarities]], [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal transformations]] and [[inversive geometry#Inversion in higher dimensions|inversions]]: they are [[Möbius transformations#Higher dimensions|Möbius transformations]] (in ''n'' dimensions).&lt;ref&gt;{{mr|id=0218544}} P. Caraman reviews  Ju.G. Resetnjak (1967) "Liouville’s conformal mapping theorem under minimal regularity hypotheses"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Hartman]] (1947) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2371855 Systems of Total Differential Equations and Liouville's theorem on Conformal Mapping] [[American Journal of Mathematics]] 69(2);329–332.&lt;/ref&gt; This theorem severely limits the variety of possible conformal mappings in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and higher-dimensional spaces. By contrast, conformal mappings in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be much more complicated – for example, all [[simply connected]] planar domains are [[conformally equivalent]], by the [[Riemann mapping theorem]].

Generalizations of the theorem hold for transformations that are only [[weak derivative|weakly differentiable]] {{harv|Iwaniec|Martin|2001|loc=Chapter 5}}. The focus of such a study is the non-linear [[Cauchy–Riemann equations|Cauchy–Riemann system]] that is a necessary and sufficient condition for a smooth mapping ''&amp;fnof;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Omega;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to be conformal:
:&lt;math&gt;Df^T Df = \left|\det Df\right|^{2/n} I&lt;/math&gt;
where ''Df'' is the [[Jacobian derivative]], ''T'' is the [[matrix transpose]], and ''I'' is the identity matrix.  A weak solution of this system is defined to be an element ''&amp;fnof;'' of the [[Sobolev space]] ''W''{{su|p=1,''n''|b=loc}}(''&amp;Omega;'','''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) with non-negative Jacobian determinant [[almost everywhere]], such that the Cauchy–Riemann system holds at almost every point of &amp;Omega;.  Liouville's theorem is then that every weak solution (in this sense) is a Möbius transformation, meaning that it has the form
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = b + \frac{\alpha A (x-a)}{|x-a|^\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'',''b'' are vectors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, &amp;alpha; is a scalar, ''A'' is a rotation matrix, and &amp;epsilon;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 or 2.  Equivalently stated, any [[quasiconformal map]] of a domain in Euclidean space that is also conformal is a Möbius transformation. This equivalent statement justifies using the Sobolev space ''W''&lt;sup&gt;1,''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, since ''&amp;fnof;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''W''{{su|p=1,''n''|b=loc}}(''&amp;Omega;'','''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) then follows from the geometrical condition of conformality and the ACL characterization of Sobolev space.  The result is not optimal however: in even dimensions ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''k'', the theorem also holds for solutions that are only assumed to be in the space ''W''{{su|p=1,''k''|b=loc}}, and this result is sharp in the sense that there are weak solutions of the Cauchy–Riemann system in ''W''&lt;sup&gt;1,''p''&lt;/sup&gt; for any ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''k'' which are not Möbius transformations.  In odd dimensions, it is known that ''W''&lt;sup&gt;1,''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is not optimal, but a sharp result is not known.

Similar rigidity results (in the smooth case) hold on any [[conformal manifold]].  The group of conformal isometries of an ''n''-dimensional conformal [[Riemannian manifold]] always has dimension that cannot exceed that of the full conformal group SO(''n''+1,1).  Equality of the two dimensions holds exactly when the conformal manifold is isometric with the [[N sphere|''n''-sphere]] or [[projective space]].  Local versions of the result also hold: The [[Lie algebra]] of [[conformal Killing equation|conformal Killing fields]] in an open set has dimension less than or equal to that of the conformal group, with equality holding if and only if the open set is locally conformally flat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29642">In [[mathematics]], a [[chaotic map]] is a [[map (mathematics)|map]] (= [[Discrete-time dynamical system|evolution function]]) that exhibits some sort of [[chaotic behavior]].  Maps may be parameterized by a discrete-time or a continuous-time parameter. Discrete maps usually take the form of [[iterated function]]s.  Chaotic maps often occur in the study of [[dynamical system]]s.

Chaotic maps often generate [[fractals]]. Although a fractal may be constructed by an iterative procedure, some fractals are studied in and of themselves, as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] rather than in terms of the map that generates them.  This is often because there are several different iterative procedures to generate the same fractal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5309">[[File:Barber on the sidewalk of a street in Nishapur 4.JPG|thumb|350px|'Suppose you walk past a barber's shop one day, and see a sign that says:&lt;br&gt;
"Do you shave yourself?&lt;br&gt;
If not, please come in and I'll shave you!&lt;br&gt;
I shave anyone who does not shave himself,&lt;br&gt;
and no one else".&lt;br&gt;
So the question is: "Who shaves the barber?"'&lt;br&gt; 
—the [[barber paradox]]|alt=Fixing quotation marks]]A '''mathematical problem''' is a problem that is amenable to being [[Representation (mathematics)|represented]], analyzed, and possibly solved, with the methods of [[mathematics]]. This can be a real-world problem, such as computing the [[Orbit#Planetary orbits|orbit]]s of the planets in the solar system, or a problem of a more abstract nature, such as [[Hilbert's problems]].&lt;br&gt;
It can also be a problem referring to the [[Foundations of mathematics|nature of mathematics]] itself, such as [[Russell's Paradox]].

==Real-world problems==
Informal "real-world" mathematical problems are questions related to a concrete setting, such as "Adam has five apples and gives John three. How many has he left?".  Such questions are usually more difficult to solve than regular [[mathematical exercise]]s like "5&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;3", even if one knows the mathematics required to solve the problem. Known as [[word problem (mathematics education)|word problem]]s, they are used in [[mathematics education]] to teach students to connect real-world situations to the abstract language of mathematics. 

In general, to use mathematics for solving a real-world problem, the first step is to construct a [[mathematical model]] of the problem. This involves abstraction from the details of the problem, and the modeller has to be careful not to lose essential aspects in translating the original problem into a mathematical one. After the problem has been solved in the world of mathematics, the [[solution (mathematics)|solution]] must be translated back into the context of the original problem.

==Abstract problems==
Abstract mathematical problems arise in all fields of mathematics. While mathematicians usually study them for their own sake, by doing so results may be obtained that find application outside the realm of mathematics. [[Theoretical physics]] has historically been, and remains, a rich source of inspiration.

Some abstract problems have been rigorously proved to be unsolvable, such as [[squaring the circle]] and [[trisecting the angle]] using only the [[compass and straightedge constructions]] of classical geometry, and solving the general [[quintic equation]] algebraically. Also provably unsolvable are so-called [[undecidable problem]]s, such as the [[halting problem]] for [[Turing machine]]s.

Many abstract problems can be solved routinely, others have been solved with great effort, for some significant inroads have been made without having led yet to a full solution, and yet others have withstood all attempts, such as [[Goldbach's conjecture]] and the [[Collatz conjecture]]. Some well-known difficult abstract problems that have been solved relatively recently are the [[four-colour theorem]], [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], and the [[Poincaré conjecture]].

==Degradation==
Mathematics educators using [[problem solving]] for evaluation have an issue phrased by Alan H. Schoenfeld:
:How can one compare test scores from year to year, when very different problems are used? (If similar problems are used year after year, teachers and students will learn what they are, students will practice them: problems become [[exercise (mathematics)|exercise]]s, and the test no longer assesses problem solving).&lt;ref&gt;Alan H. Schoenfeld (editor) (2007) ''Assessing mathematical proficiency'',  preface pages x,xi, Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{isbn|978-0-521-87492-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same issue was faced by [[Sylvestre Lacroix]] almost two centuries earlier:
:... it is necessary to vary the questions that students might communicate with each other. Though they may fail the exam, they might pass later. Thus distribution of questions, the variety of topics, or the answers, risks losing the opportunity to compare, with precision, the candidates one-to-another.&lt;ref&gt;[[S. F. Lacroix]] (1816) ''Essais sur l’enseignement en general, et sur celui des mathematiques en particulier'', page 201&lt;/ref&gt;
Such degradation of problems into exercises is characteristic of mathematics in history. For example, describing the preparations for the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]] in the 19th century, Andrew Warwick wrote:
:... many families of the then standard problems had originally taxed the abilities of the greatest mathematicians of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Warwick (2003) ''Masters of Theory: Cambridge and the Rise of Mathematical Physics'', page 145, [[University of Chicago Press]] {{isbn|0-226-87375-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2852">In [[mathematics]], in the field of [[general topology]], a [[topological space]] is said to be '''metacompact''' if every [[open cover]] has a [[point finite]] open [[Refinement (topology)|refinement]]. That is, given any open cover of the topological space, there is a refinement which is again an open cover with the property that every point is contained only in finitely many sets of the refining cover.

A space is '''countably metacompact''' if every [[countable set|countable]] open cover has a point finite open refinement.

== Properties ==
The following can be said about metacompactness in relation to other properties of topological spaces:

* Every [[paracompact space]] is metacompact. This implies that every compact space is metacompact, and every metric space is metacompact. The converse does not hold: a counter-example is the [[Dieudonné plank]].
* Every metacompact space is [[orthocompact]].
* Every metacompact [[normal space]] is a [[shrinking space]]
* The product of a [[compact space]] and a metacompact space is metacompact. This follows from the [[tube lemma]].
* An easy example of a non-metacompact space (but a countably metacompact space) is the [[Moore plane]].
* In order for a [[Tychonoff space]] ''X'' to be '''compact''' it is necessary and sufficient that ''X'' be '''metacompact''' and '''pseudocompact''' (see Watson).

== Covering dimension ==

A topological space ''X'' is said to be of [[covering dimension]] ''n'' if every open cover of ''X'' has a point finite open refinement such that no point of ''X'' is included in more than ''n'' + 1 sets in the refinement and if ''n'' is the minimum value for which this is true. If no such minimal ''n'' exists, the space is said to be of infinite covering dimension.

'''Michael David Plummer''' is a retired [[mathematics]] professor from [[Vanderbilt University]].  His field of work is in [[graph theory]] in which he has produced over a hundred papers and publications. He has also spoken at over a hundred and fifty guest lectures around the world.

==Education and career==
Plummer was born in [[Akron, Ohio]] on August 31, 1937.  He grew up in [[Lima, Ohio]] where he attended Lima Central High School, graduating in 1955. He then went to [[Wabash College]] in [[Crawfordsville, Indiana]] on an honor scholarship, with a double major in mathematics and physics. Next, he took a graduate fellowship in physics at the [[University of Michigan]], but after one year of the program, switched to mathematics; in 1966 he was awarded his Ph.D., with a thesis supervised by [[Frank Harary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=5510}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;[http://www.summerchinaprogram.org/uploadfile/en/upfilepdf/20121029023940.pdf Curriculum vitae]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Summer China Program, retrieved 2013-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

After postdoctoral studies at [[Yale University]] from 1966 to 1968, Plummer took an assistant professorship in the recently formed Department of Computer Science at [[City College of New York]].  In 1970 he joined the Department of Mathematics at [[Vanderbilt University]], and remained there until his retirement in 2008.&lt;ref name="cv"/&gt;

==Contributions==
Among his other contributions to graph theory, Plummer is responsible for defining [[well-covered graph]]s,{{sfnp|Plummer|1970}} for making with [[László Lovász]] the now-proven conjecture (generalizing [[Petersen's theorem]]) that every [[Bridge (graph theory)|bridgeless]] [[cubic graph]] has an exponential number of [[perfect matching]]s,&lt;ref name="EKKKN11"&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2478">In [[mathematics]], '''Milliken's tree theorem''' in [[combinatorics]] is a partition theorem generalizing [[Ramsey's theorem]] to infinite [[Tree (set theory)|trees]], objects with more structure than [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].

Let T be a finitely splitting [[rooted tree]] of height ω, n a positive integer, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^n_T&lt;/math&gt; the collection of all strongly embedded subtrees of T of height n. In one of its simple forms, Milliken's tree theorem states that if &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^n_T=C_1 \cup ... \cup C_r&lt;/math&gt; then for some strongly embedded infinite subtree R of T, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^n_R \subset C_i&lt;/math&gt; for some i ≤ r.

This immediately implies [[Ramsey's theorem]]; take the tree T to be a linear ordering on ω vertices. 

Define &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^n= \bigcup_T \mathbb{S}^n_T&lt;/math&gt; where T ranges over finitely splitting rooted trees of height ω. Milliken's tree theorem says that not only is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^n&lt;/math&gt; [[partition regular]] for each n &amp;lt; ω, but that the homogeneous subtree R guaranteed by the theorem is '''strongly embedded''' in T.

== Strong embedding ==
Call T an α-tree if each branch of T has cardinality α.  Define Succ(p, P)= &lt;math&gt; \{ q \in P : q \geq p \}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;IS(p,P)&lt;/math&gt; to be the set of immediate successors of p in P. Suppose S is an α-tree and T is a β-tree, with 0 ≤ α ≤ β ≤ ω. S is ''strongly embedded'' in T if:

* &lt;math&gt;S \subset T&lt;/math&gt;, and the partial order on S is induced from T,
* if &lt;math&gt;s \in S&lt;/math&gt; is nonmaximal in S and &lt;math&gt;t \in IS(s,T)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;|Succ(t,T) \cap IS(s,S)|=1&lt;/math&gt;,
* there exists a strictly increasing function from &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;S(n) \subset T(f(n)).&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, for S to be strongly embedded in T, 
* S must be a subset of T with the induced partial order
* S must preserve the branching structure of T; ''i.e.'', if a nonmaximal node in S has n immediate successors in T, then it has n immediate successors in S
* S preserves the level structure of T; all nodes on a common level of S must be on a common level in T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4245">In [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], a complete theory ''T'' is said to satisfy '''NIP''' (or "not the independence property") if none of its formulae satisfy the '''independence property''', that is if none of its formulae can pick out any given subset of an arbitrarily large finite set.

==Definition==

Let ''T'' be a [[Complete theory|complete]] ''L''-theory.  An ''L''-formula φ('''''x''''','''''y''''') is said to have the independence property (with respect to '''''x''''', '''''y''''') if in every model ''M'' of ''T'' there is, for each ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{0,1,&amp;hellip;,''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1}&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;ω, a family of [[tuple]]s '''''b'''''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,'''''b'''''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; such that for each of the 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; subsets ''X'' of ''n'' there is a tuple '''''a''''' in ''M'' for which
:&lt;math&gt;M\models\varphi(\boldsymbol{a},\boldsymbol{b}_i)\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad  i\in X.&lt;/math&gt;
The theory ''T'' is said to have the independence property if some formula has the independence property.  If no ''L''-formula has the independence property then ''T'' is called dependent, or said to satisfy NIP.  An ''L''-structure is said to have the independence property (respectively, NIP) if its theory has the independence theory (respectively, NIP).  The terminology comes from the notion of independence in the sense of [[Boolean algebra (structure)|boolean algebras]].

In the nomenclature of [[Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory]], we may say that a collection '''''S''''' of subsets of ''X'' ''shatters'' a set ''B''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''X'' if every subset of ''B'' is of the form ''B''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''S'' for some ''S''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''''S'''''.  Then ''T'' has the independence property if in some model ''M'' of ''T'' there is a definable family (''S''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''a''∈''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''M''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; that shatters arbitrarily large finite subsets of ''M''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.  In other words, (''S''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''a''∈''M''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) has infinite [[VC dimension|Vapnik–Chervonenkis dimension]].

==Examples==

Any complete theory ''T'' that has the independence property is [[Stable theory|unstable]].&lt;ref&gt;See Hodges.&lt;/ref&gt;

In arithmetic, i.e. the structure ('''N''',+,·), the formula "''y'' divides ''x''" has the independence property.&lt;ref&gt;See Poizat, page 249.&lt;/ref&gt;  This formula is just
:&lt;math&gt;(\exists k)(y\cdot k=x).&lt;/math&gt;
So, for any finite ''n'' we take the ''n'' 1-tuples ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to be the first ''n'' [[prime number]]s, and then for any subset ''X'' of {0,1,&amp;hellip;,''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1} we let ''a'' be the product of those ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''i'' is in ''X''.  Then ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; divides ''a'' if and only if ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X''.

Every [[o-minimal theory]] satisfies NIP.&lt;ref&gt;Pillay and Steinhorn, corollary 3.10 and Knight, Pillay, and Steinhorn, theorem 0.2.&lt;/ref&gt;  This fact has had unexpected applications to neural network learning.&lt;ref&gt;See Anthony and Bartlett for details.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], the '''negative multinomial distribution''' is a generalization of the [[negative binomial distribution]] (NB(''r'',&amp;thinsp;''p'')) to more than two outcomes.&lt;ref name="LeGall"&gt;Le Gall, F. The modes of a negative multinomial distribution, Statistics &amp; Probability Letters, Volume 76, Issue 6, 15 March 2006, Pages 619-624, ISSN 0167-7152, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V1D-4H7T8P0-1/2/54b376fc96fdd6ad4331325a822df997 10.1016/j.spl.2005.09.009].&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppose we have an experiment that generates ''m''+1≥2 possible outcomes, {''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}, each occurring with non-negative probabilities {''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''p''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;} respectively. If sampling proceeded until ''n'' observations were made, then {''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;} would have been [[multinomial distribution|multinomially distributed]]. However, if the experiment is stopped once ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; reaches the predetermined value ''k''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then the distribution of the ''m''-tuple {''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;} is ''negative multinomial''.  These variables are not multinomially distributed because their sum ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+…+''X''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is not fixed, being a draw from a [[negative binomial distribution]].

==Negative multinomial distribution example==

&lt;/center&gt;

The sites (locations) of the cancer may be independent, but there may be positive dependencies of the type of cancer for a given location (site). For example, localized exposure to radiation implies that elevated level of one type of cancer (at a given location) may indicate higher level of another cancer type at the same location. The Negative Multinomial distribution may be used to model the cancer rates at a given site and help measure some of the cancer type dependencies within each location.

If &lt;math&gt;x_{i,j}&lt;/math&gt; denote the cancer rates for each site (&lt;math&gt;0\leq i \leq 2&lt;/math&gt;) and each type of cancer (&lt;math&gt;0\leq j \leq 3&lt;/math&gt;), for a fixed site (&lt;math&gt;i_0&lt;/math&gt;) the cancer rates are independent Negative Multinomial distributed random variables. That is, for each column index (site) the column-vector X has the following distribution:
: &lt;math&gt;X=\{X_1, X_2, X_3\} \sim NM(k_0,\{p_1,p_2,p_3\})&lt;/math&gt;.
Different columns in the table (sites) are considered to be different instances of the random multinomially distributed vector, X. Then we have the following estimates of expected counts (frequencies of cancer):
: &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu}_{i,j} = \frac{x_{i,.}\times x_{.,j}}{x_{.,.}}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x_{i,.} = \sum_{j=0}^{3}{x_{i,j}}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x_{.,j} = \sum_{i=0}^{2}{x_{i,j}}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;x_{.,.} = \sum_{i=0}^{2}\sum_{j=0}^{3}{{x_{i,j}}}&lt;/math&gt;
: Example: &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu}_{1,1} = \frac{x_{1,.}\times x_{.,1}}{x_{.,.}}=\frac{34\times 68}{400}=5.78&lt;/math&gt;

For the first site (Head and Neck, j=0), suppose that &lt;math&gt;X=\left \{X_1=5, X_2=1, X_3=5\right \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X \sim NM(k_0=10, \{p_1=0.2, p_2=0.1, p_3=0.2 \})&lt;/math&gt;. Then:
: &lt;math&gt;p_0 = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^3{p_i}=0.5&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;NM(X|k_0,\{p_1, p_2, p_3\})= 0.00465585119998784 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;cov[X_1,X_3] = \frac{10 \times 0.2 \times 0.2}{0.5^2}=1.6&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mu_2=\frac{k_0 p_2}{p_0} = \frac{10\times 0.1}{0.5}=2.0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mu_3=\frac{k_0 p_3}{p_0} = \frac{10\times 0.2}{0.5}=4.0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;corr[X_2,X_3] = \left (\frac{\mu_2 \times \mu_3}{(k_0+\mu_2)(k_0+\mu_3)} \right )^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; and therefore, &lt;math&gt;corr[X_2,X_3] = \left (\frac{2 \times 4}{(10+2)(10+4)} \right )^{\frac{1}{2}} = 0.21821789023599242. &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the pair-wise NM correlations are always positive, whereas the correlations between [[Multinomial distribution|multinomial counts]] are always negative. As the parameter &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; increases, the paired correlations tend to zero! Thus, for large &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt;, the Negative Multinomial counts &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; behave as ''independent'' [[Poisson distribution|Poisson random variables]] with respect to their means &lt;math&gt;\left ( \mu_i= k_0\frac{p_i}{p_0}\right )&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[marginal distribution]] of each of the &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; variables is [[negative binomial]], as the &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; count (considered as success) is measured against all the other outcomes (failure). But jointly, the distribution of &lt;math&gt;X=\{X_1,\cdots,X_m\}&lt;/math&gt; is negative multinomial, i.e., &lt;math&gt;X \sim NM(k_0,\{p_1,\cdots,p_m\})&lt;/math&gt; .

==Parameter estimation==
* Estimation of the mean (expected) frequency counts (&lt;math&gt;\mu_j&lt;/math&gt;) of each outcome (&lt;math&gt;X_j&lt;/math&gt;) using maximum likelihood is possible. If we have a single observation vector &lt;math&gt;\{x_1, \cdots,x_m\}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu}_i=x_i.&lt;/math&gt; If we have several observation vectors, like in this case we have the cancer type frequencies for 3 different sites, then the MLE estimates of the mean counts are &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu}_j=\frac{x_{j,.}}{I}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;0\leq j \leq J&lt;/math&gt; is the cancer-type index and the summation is over the number of observed (sampled) vectors (I). For the cancer data above, we have the following MLE estimates for the expectations for the frequency counts:
::: Hutchinson's melanomic freckle type of cancer (&lt;math&gt;X_0&lt;/math&gt;) is &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu}_0 = 34/3=11.33&lt;/math&gt;.
::: Superficial type of cancer (&lt;math&gt;X_1&lt;/math&gt;) is &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu}_1 = 185/3=61.67&lt;/math&gt;.
::: Nodular type of cancer (&lt;math&gt;X_2&lt;/math&gt;) is &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu}_2 = 125/3=41.67&lt;/math&gt;.
::: Indeterminant type of cancer (&lt;math&gt;X_3&lt;/math&gt;) is &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu}_3 = 56/3=18.67&lt;/math&gt;.

* There is no [[Maximum likelihood estimation|MLE estimate]] for the NM &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; parameter.&lt;ref name="LeGall" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Zelterman| first = Daniel |  title = Advanced log-linear models using SAS | publisher = SAS Publishing | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-1-59047-080-0 | page=196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are approximate protocols for estimating the &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; parameter using the [[Chi square distribution|chi-squared goodness of fit statistic]]. In the usual chi-squared statistic:
: &lt;math&gt;\Chi^2 = \sum_i{\frac{(x_i-\mu_i)^2}{\mu_i}}&lt;/math&gt;, we can replace the expected-means (&lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt;) by their estimates, &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu_i}&lt;/math&gt;, and replace denominators by the corresponding negative multinomial variances. Then we get the following test statistic for negative multinomial distributed data:
: &lt;math&gt;\Chi^2(k_0) = \sum_{i}{\frac{(x_i-\hat{\mu_i})^2}{\hat{\mu_i} \left (1+ \frac{\hat{\mu_i}}{k_0} \right )}}&lt;/math&gt;.

: Next, we can estimate the &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; parameter by varying the values of &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; in the expression &lt;math&gt;\Chi^2(k_0)&lt;/math&gt; and matching the values of this statistic with the corresponding asymptotic chi-squared distribution. The following protocol summarizes these steps using the cancer data above.
:: ''DF'': The [[Chi-squared distribution|degree of freedom for the Chi-squared distribution]] in this case is:
::: df = (# rows – 1)(# columns – 1) = (3-1)*(4-1) = 6

:: ''Median'': The median of a chi-squared random variable with 6 df is 5.261948.

:: ''Mean Counts Estimates'': The mean counts estimates (&lt;math&gt;\mu_j&lt;/math&gt;) for the 4 different cancer types are:
:::&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu}_1 = 185/3=61.67&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu}_2 = 125/3=41.67&lt;/math&gt;; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mu}_3 = 56/3=18.67&lt;/math&gt;.

: Thus, we can solve the equation above &lt;math&gt;\Chi^2(k_0) = 5.261948&lt;/math&gt; for the single variable of interest -- the unknown parameter &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt;. In the cancer example, suppose &lt;math&gt;x=\{x_1=5,x_2=1,x_3=5\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the solution is an asymptotic chi-squared distribution driven estimate of the parameter &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt;.
: &lt;math&gt;\Chi^2(k_0) = \sum_{i=1}^3{\frac{(x_i-\hat{\mu_i})^2}{\hat{\mu_i} \left (1+ \frac{\hat{\mu_i}}{k_0} \right )}}&lt;/math&gt;.
: &lt;math&gt;\Chi^2(k_0) = \frac{(5-61.67)^2}{61.67(1+61.67/k_0)}+\frac{(1-41.67)^2}{41.67(1+41.67/k_0)}+\frac{(5-18.67)^2}{18.67(1+18.67/k_0)}=5.261948.&lt;/math&gt; Solving this equation for &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; provides the desired estimate for the last parameter.
:: [[Mathematica]] provides 3 distinct (&lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt;) solutions to this equation: {'''50.5466''', -21.5204, '''2.40461'''}. Since &lt;math&gt;k_0&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; there are 2 candidate solutions.

* Estimates of probabilities: Assume &lt;math&gt;k_0=2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mu_i}{k_0}p_0=p_i&lt;/math&gt;, then:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{61.67}{k_0}p_0=31p_0=p_1&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;20p_0=p_2&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;9p_0=p_3&lt;/math&gt;
: Hence, &lt;math&gt;1-p_0=p_1+p_2+p_3=60p_0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;p_0=\frac{1}{61}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_1=\frac{31}{61}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p_2=\frac{20}{61}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_3=\frac{9}{61}&lt;/math&gt;.
: Therefore, the best model distribution for the observed sample &lt;math&gt;x=\{x_1=5,x_2=1,x_3=5\}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;X \sim NM\left (2, \left \{\frac{31}{61}, \frac{20}{61},\frac{9}{61}\right\} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

'''''Numbertime''''' is a [[BBC]] educational [[numeracy]] television series for [[primary schools]] that was aired on [[BBC Two]] from 20 September 1993 to 3 December 2001. For its first four series, it was presented by [[Lolita Chakrabarti]]. [[El Nombre]], an animated character from ''Numbertime'', eventually became the concept for another educational BBC children's television program; his name means "The Name" in Spanish, and not "The Number", which would be "El Número". The third line of his opening song and his farewell catchphrase were also changed several times during the series' run, to reflect their focus - however, the original ones ("Writing numbers in the desert sand" which was also used for the seventh series, and "Adios amigos, and keep counting" which was also used for the fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth series) remain the most famous.

For the second series, El Nombre's tagline and farewell catchphrase were changed to "Drawing shapes in the desert sand" and "Adios amigos, and keep shaping up" respectively, while for the third series, they were changed to "Righting wrongs in the desert sand" and "Adios amigos, over and out" respectively; however, for the fourth series, his tagline was changed to "Counting numbers in the desert sand" (which was also used for the ninth series), and for the third episode of the fourth series, his farewell catchphrase was changed to "Adios amigos, and fetch some water". For the fifth series, both his tagline and farewell catchphrase were changed to "Telling time in the desert sand" and "Adios amigos, 'till the next time" respectively, while for the sixth series, his tagline was changed to "Using numbers in the desert sand"; finally, for the eighth series, his tagline was changed to "Counting money in the desert sand".

==Series 1: Numbers 1 to 10 (Autumn 1993)==

The first series, which is aimed at four- to five-year-olds, comprised ten episodes focusing on the numbers 1-10, in order; each episode opened with Lolita introducing herself to the viewer, and pulling the number for the episode off its string (which was hanging from the studio ceiling), then pushing it into its correct hole in a wall, and singing the main theme, ''One to Ten'', as each of its holes lit up in turn, which was repeated throughout the programme. In between, there were comedy sketches (mostly based on [[nursery rhymes]]), and animations, the most famous involving El Nombre, the Mexican gerbil who parodied [[Zorro]], showing little Juan how to draw numbers as his four-piece mariachi band played ''[[The Mexican Hat Dance]]'' (and said "Again!" once he had finished, as it gave them an excuse to play again), and a sequence encouraging the viewer to spot things of the number for each episode - it was the same video, with a different number of things each time (and a recurring song, ''Numbers All Around'', which was sung by a group of children). Each episode ended with Lolita singing a song (or occasionally, introducing an animation), after which she would set viewers the challenge of looking for things in the number of the week's episode before saying that she would "see them next Numbertime".

This series was originally aired on Mondays as part of the ''Daytime on Two'' strand at 9:45am, and repeated at 2:00pm on the same day; in Scotland, the 2:00pm repeats were replaced with broadcasts of BBC Scotland's own schools series ''[[Over the Moon with Mr. Boom]]''.

&lt;!-- Do *not* change any of the air dates in this, or any other, section, as they all now have a reference to their original listings in their weeks' Radio Times on their BBC Genome pages; there is really no reason for any of the sections' headers to be changed either. --&gt;
*Episode 1: ''Number 1'' (20 September 1993)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1993-09-20 BBC Two England - 20 September 1993 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Narrator proudly presents ''Nursery Rhyme Theatre No. 1 - [[Little Miss Muffet]]'' with several interruptions, and [[Little Jack Horner]] has one minute to ''Find 1 Plum'' on Sammy Sallow's game show of the same name; if he succeeds, he can choose one prize - one mountain bike, or one computer, or one picture of Sallow. This episode also ends with ''One Finger, One Thumb, Keep Moving'', which is sung by the group of children who sang ''Numbers All Around'' earlier on in it.

*Episode 2: ''Number 2'' (27 September 1993)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1993-09-27 BBC Two England - 27 September 1993 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Narrator introduces ''Nursery Rhyme Theatre No. 2'' with Marvo the Magician (and his [[Two Little Dickie Birds|Two Amazing Dickey Birds]]), and Sammy Sport reports on [[Jack and Jill (nursery rhyme)|Jack and Jill]]'s attempt to break the world record for the fastest time to run up a hill, fill a pail with water, and take it back down the hill again (under 2 minutes); this episode also ends with Lolita singing ''[[The Animals Went in Two by Two]]''.

*Episode 3: ''Number 3'' (4 October 1993)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1993-10-04 BBC Two England - 4 October 1993 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sammy Sport is joined by [[Baa Baa Black Sheep|Baa-Baa Black Sheep]] for the results of the "Win a Bag of Wool" competition, while [[Goldilocks and the Three Bears|Goldilocks]] invites viewers to ''Guess Whose House'' (for Sammy Sallow's game show of the same name); the Numbertime Top Ten also brings the viewers, at No. 3, the ever-popular "Three-Sided Triangles", who sing an original song named ''We're Triangles (Oh Yes We Are)''.

*Episode 4: ''Number 4'' (11 October 1993)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1993-10-11 BBC Two England - 11 October 1993 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmer Giles introduces the finals of ''[[One Man and His Dog|One Girl and Her Sheep]]'' at which [[Little Bo Peep]] and her dog Shep are competing, and the Knave of Hearts talks to the [[Queen (playing card)|Queen of Hearts]] about her famous royal tarts; Lolita also tells the viewers to "grab their partners and take the floor" as she introduces a quartet of dancing squares, who sing an original song named ''Do the Square Dance''.

*Episode 5: ''Number 5'' (18 October 1993)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1993-10-18 BBC Two England - 18 October 1993 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian chef Wally Bee (and his assistant, Bruce) attempt to show the viewers how to cook five fat sausages on a barbecue for ''Barbecue Time'', and Harry Headline pays a visit to the home of the [[This Little Piggy|Five Pigs Family]] for ''Five Minutes' Fame''; Little Juan also has his 5th birthday in this episode's ''El Nombre'' sketch, and this episode ends with Lolita singing ''Fly, Little Dickey Birds, Round and Round''.

*Episode 6: ''Number 6'' (1 November 1993)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1993-11-01 BBC Two England - 1 November 1993 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

A gardener named Fred enlists the help of his family in pulling up his [[The Giant Turnip|enormous turnip]] for ''Garden Time'', and Mr. and Mrs. Jones have to ''Take 6 Eggs'' on Sammy Sallow's game show of the same name and put them on either side of a seesaw to make it balance, for which they have three attempts to do so; this episode also ends with Lolita singing ''[[This Old Man]]'' in voiceover.

*Episode 7: ''Number 7'' (8 November 1993)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1993-11-08 BBC Two England - 8 November 1993 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sammy Sport travels to [[Scotland]] to see a remarkable fishing contest between the famous Seven Fat Fishermen, to see which one of them can catch the biggest fish, and ordering seven lots of fish and chips turns out to be more trouble than it is worth for the Shopkeeper and his Customer (who has got seven children, and they all want fish and chips); this episode also ends with Lolita singing ''In My Little Garden, Now Promise You Won't Laugh'' (also known as ''One Potato, Two Potato'').

*Episode 8: ''Number 8'' (15 November 1993)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1993-11-15 BBC Two England - 15 November 1993 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sammy Sport travels down to [[Shoeburyness]] to interview the [[There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe|Old Woman who Lives in a Shoe]] (who has 8 children), and the Policeman enlists the viewers' help in finding [[Wee Willie Winkie]] for ''[[Crimewatch|Crime Spot]]''; it is also evening in Little Juan's town in this episode's ''El Nombre'' sketch, and this episode ends with Lolita imagining what the world would be like if everything was eight-shaped as she visits the Planet of the Eights to sing an original song about it (and this is the only occasion in this series that she is not seen in her usual purple outfit, but a silver spacesuit).

*Episode 9: ''Number 9'' (22 November 1993)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1993-11-22 BBC Two England - 22 November 1993 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucky the Cat looks back over her nine lives, as she guests on ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is My Life]]'', and Harry Headline comes to the garden of Miss [[Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary]], to look at the wonderful display of flowers for ''Garden Time''; unfortunately, he ruins her chances of winning their "Best Flowers Competition", and she ends up coming ninth. This was also the only episode for this series to not end with a song - instead, Lolita shows the viewers a homemade necklace which has nine beads (three red, three blue, and three yellow), in reference to the episode's third animated sketch.

*Episode 10: ''Number 10'' (29 November 1993)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1993-11-29 BBC Two England - 29 November 1993 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Farmer Giles (and his dog, Scruff) show viewers a wonderful, new, and very quick way to mow a meadow for ''Farming News'', and Sammy Sport travels to Ten Pin Alley to watch Ten Pin Pete attempt to become the new Ten Pin Champ; Lolita also shows the viewers ten Russian dolls, and this episode ends with ''Ten in the Bed'' (which is, again, sung by the group of children who sang ''Numbers All Around'' earlier on in it). Also, because this episode was the last in the series, Lolita did not tell the viewers that she would "see them next Numbertime".

In 1994, [[BBC Enterprises]] (now '''BBC Worldwide''') released a video entitled "Number Time" (BBCV 5359, and spelled with two words), containing sixty minutes of edited highlights from this series (it was the only one at the time); it was later rereleased as the second half of a "two-on-one" video in 1997 with the ''[[Words and Pictures (BBC series)|Words and Pictures]]'' "Alphabet Fun Time" video (BBCV 5357), which had originally been released at around the same time and contained fifty-eight minutes of highlights from that show's 1992 series (the "two-on-one" video in question was entitled "Alphabet Fun Time and Number Time", BBCV 5987, and it was rereleased in 1999). This series was later re-released in full as a "Video Plus Pack" in 1996 - only slightly altered to remove the episodes' opening titles.

From 22 September to 1 December 1998, the BBC broadcast a "revised" version of this series as a lead-in to the sixth series; in place of Lolita, Bill (introduced in the fourth series) and Bernie (who joined him in the fifth one) introduced each episode with a number line of their own (however, Lolita's voice was still heard narrating some re-used animated sketches). All except six of the original live-action sketches were replaced with Dolls' House (again, see Series 5) ones - and the ''El Nombre'' sketches were slightly lengthened. Sequences of children discussing the ten numbers (in the vein of those discussing the time-related concepts covered by the fifth series) were also introduced; although the ''Planet of the Eights'' sketch was also re-used, the vocal track was redubbed and Lolita was edited out of it.

==Series 2: Shapes (Spring 1995) &lt;!-- Do *not* change the year to "1994", as the copyright date shown at the end of each episode clearly says "© BBC Education *MCMXCV*", which means "1995" in Roman numerals; due to the fact that every episode's air date now has a reference to its original listing in its week's Radio Times on its BBC Genome page, there is really no reason for them to be changed at all. --&gt;==

The second series, which is again aimed at four- to five-year-olds, comprised five episodes, focusing on the four basic two-dimensional shapes; each episode would open with Lolita standing by a mobile with the four basic shapes hanging from it and singing the series' main theme, ''Squares and Triangles, Circles and Rectangles'' as the mobile began to turn. Once it had stopped turning, she would walk over to the shape that was nearest to her, then ask the viewers if they knew what it was, before it lit up and she told them - and from this series onwards, El Nombre was given ''two'' sketches per episode (the first to show Juan instances of that week's shape around the town, with Juan being clumsy and getting confronted by the other villagers after El Nombre had left, and the second to draw it in the desert sand). This series also featured four [[Cutout animation|cut-out]] animated characters made up from the shapes its episodes were focusing on (a circular man with magical powers, a square robot with transformation powers, a triangular knight with a magical lance and a rectangular man); in the last episode, they worked together to build a house (after the rectangular man built one entirely out of rectangles, and the square robot, triangular knight and circular man transformed them into their own shapes). Each episode would end with Lolita singing an "extended" version of a song that had been heard earlier in the episode during a montage of the shape around the real world (for the last one, she continued over the credits) and setting viewers the challenge of seeing how many of that week's shape they could find before the next episode.

The first two episodes of this series were, again, originally aired as part of the ''Daytime on Two'' strand on Mondays at 9:45am, but 8 May 1995 was the year's [[May Day]], so its third episode was aired the following day; the last two episodes were also aired on Mondays.

&lt;!-- Do *not* change any of the air dates in this, or any other, section, as they all now have a reference to their original listings in their weeks' Radio Times on their BBC Genome pages; there is really no reason for any of the sections' headers to be changed either. --&gt;
*Episode 11: ''Circles'' (24 April 1995)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1995-04-24 BBC Two England - 24 April 1995 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

El Nombre shows Juan what a circle is (with a cart's wheel, a hoopla ring and a hoop with its stick), while a man named Terry introduces the world-famous "[[Ring a Ring o' Roses]] Formation Dance Team" (and their manager, Cynthia) on ''[[Come Dancing|Come Prancing]]'', and a prehistoric couple try to invent the round wheel (after the square and triangular ones) for their car for ''Great Moments in History''; also, in this episode's second cut-out animated sketch, circular pawprints transform into a circular ladybird, a circular bird, a circular caterpillar (that becomes a circular butterfly), a circular fish which blows circular bubbles, a circular car which emits circular smoke from its circular exhaust, a circular man's head, and a circular bear (and in its CGI animated sketch, a circle gains two additional planes and proceeds to transform into a beach ball, a football, an orange and the planet Earth).

*Episode 12: ''Squares'' (1 May 1995)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1995-05-01 BBC Two England - 1 May 1995 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

El Nombre shows Juan what a square is (with the then-unnamed Pedro and Juanita's frame, the then-also-unnamed Señor Manuel and Señor Chipito's draughts board, The Maggot and Cactus saloon's sign and a blackboard), while Bobby Cube asks the Shape Spotters on ''Let's Shape Up'' to name the square by pointing out its distinguishing features, a square robot builds a square dog (which turns on him after catching his scent, but he scares it away by transforming into a much bigger square dog with a big square that he runs to and climbs up), and Jill Scoop reports on [[Old King Cole]] who is wanting his square bowl (after round, triangular and rectangular ones) for ''[[Newsround|Newsdesk]]''; also, for this episode's CGI animated sketch, the yellow square in the bottom-right of a gameboard rises out of it to become a cube and has the numbers 1-6 written on each of its sides (which proceed to transform into six groups of dots of those respective amounts as the cube becomes the dice in a game of ''[[Snakes and Ladders]]'').

*Episode 13: ''Triangles'' (9 May 1995)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1995-05-09 BBC Two England - 9 May 1995 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

El Nombre shows Juan what a triangle is (with a musical triangle, a roadworks sign and a stepladder), while [[Aladdin]] finds the lamp with a triangle on it (after the ones with a circle and square on them) for his Uncle Abanazer, but he wastes its three wishes (one for each of the triangle's sides and corners) by turning Abanazer into a cat, and himself into a mouse, as well as making it disappear (which causes Abanazer to turn on him, but they both questioned why there was not a Genie in the lamp when asked); a triangular knight also sets out to slay a triangular dragon (but gets burned to a crisp the first attempt, and gets rained on along with the triangular dragon's fire getting put out the second attempt) while Bobby Cube asks the Shape Spotters on ''Let's Shape Up'' (who are the same ones from the previous episode, but have swapped positions) to identify the triangle (again, by pointing out its distinguishing features to them). Also, for this episode's CGI animated sketch, a triangle has a dotted line drawn inside it, then folds up to become a triangular-based pyramid, and rotates to show the numbers 1-4 on its sides as they light up before unfolding back into a triangle again.

*Episode 14: ''Rectangles'' (15 May 1995)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1995-05-15 BBC Two England - 15 May 1995 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

El Nombre shows Juan what a rectangle is (with a plank of wood, the cart's side and the then-still-unnamed Pedro and Juanita's piece of cardboard), while Sammy Shape pays a visit to [[Old Mother Hubbard]]'s cottage to find out "what makes a rectangle a rectangle" for ''Shapewatch'' (which, like the ''Crime Spot'' sketch from the previous series, is a spoof of ''Crimewatch'') and met by her dog (who, as in the nursery rhyme, wants a bone, but they find a rectangular biscuit instead), a rectangular man goes for a swim at a swimming pool (after walking up a staircase, taking an elevator and walking up another staircase), [[Humpty Dumpty]] is asked to identify the shape of one of the bricks in the wall he is sitting on (which he does just before he falls), and a woman named Jane keeps in touch with her grandmother by writing a rectangular letter, posting it into a postbox which has a rectangular slot and door, then arriving at her house after she receives it.

*Episode 15: ''Shapes Together'' (22 May 1995)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1995-05-22 BBC Two England - 22 May 1995 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

El Nombre helps Juan remember which shape is which (with the square frame, the circular hoop with its stick, a rectangular book and the triangular roadworks sign), while the rectangular man, the square robot, the triangular knight, and the circular man (who now has a circular body and a wheel for a foot) work together to build a house (after the rectangular man built one entirely out of rectangles, and the square robot, triangular knight and circular man transformed them into their own shapes) and show that "all different shapes work well together", Bobby Cube asks the Shape Spotters on ''Let's Shape Up'' to identify the "Shy Shapes" hiding in a [[cola]] can and [[Battenberg cake]], and a rectangle folds up to become a hollow cylinder as two circles cover its ends and a second rectangle wraps itself around it as it becomes a can of [[baked beans]]; also, in this episode's second ''El Nombre'' sketch, Juan draws "El Nombre" (a square, rectangle, circle, and triangle stacked on top of each other), before drawing "the rope that hits him on the head and knocks him over". El Nombre then says that it has never happened to him - so Juan swings a rope at him, and tells him "It has now!". The sombrero-less El Nombre then chases Juan through the streets of the town to an extended version of his theme song (with the new tagline "Drawing shapes in the desert sand" at the end), but he never catches him; this is also the only old-style episode to only have one live-action sketch in it (rather than two or three).

In 1996, both this series and the next series were released on VHS as "Video Plus Packs" by '''BBC Educational Publishing''' (now '''BBC Active'''); the following year, they were also rereleased together as a double "Video Plus Pack" named "Numbertime Shapes/Side by Side".

After the corporate change in 1997, BBC Education's then-current Internet address (&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/education/&lt;/nowiki&gt;) was superimposed onto the four shapes (a red circle, a green triangle, a yellow square and a blue rectangle) seen at the end of this series' episodes, as well as the thirteen episodes of the next two series; however, it was never added to the end of the first series' episodes.

==Series 3: Side by Side (Autumn 1995, broadcast Spring 1996)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8140e32c BFI - Numbertime: Side by Side (1995)]&lt;/ref&gt;==

The third series (which is, once again, aimed at four- to five-year-olds) comprised five episodes, focusing on concepts of space and position; each episode would open with Lolita singing the series' main theme, ''Under, Over, Everywhere'' (the mobile from the previous series was also visible in the background, but it now had an apple, three stickmen, a rainbow, a cloud with a hot-air balloon, a sun, a snake, a spider and a snail hanging from it). In this series, Juan gained three new friends named '''Pedro Gonzales''', '''Juanita Conchita''', and '''Maria Consuela Tequila Chiquita''' (Pedro and Juanita had also previously appeared in the second series), as well as a pet tarantula named '''Tanto''' - and each episode would end with Lolita reciting a rhyme or singing a song (but the one of the second episode was an extended version of one that had been heard in voiceover earlier in the episode during an animated sketch about a fox). A sketch in the second episode of this series also parodied ''[[EastEnders]]'' as ''"GreenGrocers"''; this was also the first series to credit the ''El Nombre'' voice actors at the end of its last episode ([[Sophie Aldred]], who had played Ace on ''[[Doctor Who]]'' as well as one of the presenters of ''Words and Pictures'', ''[[Spitting Image]]'' impressionist [[Kate Robbins]], who had also voiced Jemima Wellington-Green on ''[[Round the Bend]]'', and [[Steve Steen]], who had played [[Lord Byron]] in ''[[Ink and Incapability]]'', the second episode of ''[[Blackadder the Third]]''). Although this series was made in Autumn 1995, it was not broadcast until 28 February 1996.

This series and the next one were originally aired on Wednesdays in the ''Daytime on Two'' strand at 10:25am; this series also premiered after a rerun of the second one finished, and the next one premiered when ''Daytime on Two'' returned after a two-week [[Easter]] break.

Juan does not have anything to do for the school concert so El Nombre tells him that he can recite ''[[Incy Wincy Spider]]'' with Tanto, a bear flies a kite (but it comes down in a tree, so he has to climb it to retrieve it), a window cleaner is annoyed by the incompetence of her colleague, Juan recites ''Incy Wincy Spider'' at the school concert (but Tanto will not come down the drainpipe, so El Nombre has to coax him) and three clowns named Boris, Doris and Ethel compete to see which one can raise the biggest laugh in ''Give Us a Giggle''.

*Episode 17: ''In Front of, Behind, Before, and After'' (6 March 1996)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1996-03-06 BBC Two England - 6 March 1996 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan wants to take a photograph of himself and Mama together (but cannot because he is behind the Polaroid), an engine driver pulls some wagons behind (but the coupling snaps when he goes up a hill, so when they roll back down they are in front of him, and he has to signal for the driver of a second engine to help him), Jack and Jill must take Farmer Giles's horse and cart to market in ''Happy Ever After'', a fox hides in his secret lair to escape a hunt (accompanied by a rhyme from Lolita in voiceover), Juan still does not have a photograph of himself and Mama together (so El Nombre takes it himself and blows himself up in the process), and the proprietor of ''GreenGrocers'' tries to get his four customers of the day to stand behind his stall and form a proper queue (until he gets upstaged by a toy salesman).

*Episode 18: ''Under, Over, On Top of, and Beneath'' (13 March 1996)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1996-03-13 BBC Two England - 13 March 1996 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan cannot score a goal past Pedro so El Nombre (who is not seen in his usual outfit in this episode, but what would later become Santo &lt;!-- Note: Please do not change this to "Santa", as the voiceover at the start of the El Nombre single's video, which was added as a reference to stop the edit warring, clearly says "Deep in the heart of Mexico, there is a little town, called *Santo* Flamingo". --&gt;  Flamingo United's strip) tells him to kick the ball over him, Princess Perfect wants a bed fit for a princess (in the sense of not being able to feel a pea under the mattress), a tortoise named Toby goes to a party but cannot get over the hedge to it (unlike the four other guests of a bird, a frog, a squirrel and a rabbit, but the last of them tells him to go under the hedge instead), Pedro is standing on a stool so Juan again cannot score past him (until El Nombre tells him to kick the ball under him, and when Pedro objects, they reduce the size of the goal, but El Nombre whispers to Juan to kick the ball to one side of Pedro before he leaves), and the Cow (of ''[[Hey Diddle Diddle]]'') is scared of having to jump over the Moon (so the Little Dog volunteers the Dish instead, but he suggests running under it).

*Episode 19: ''Beside, Around, and Between'' (20 March 1996)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1996-03-20 BBC Two England - 20 March 1996 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mama wants to go to Hurrell's store but there is a hole in the ground in front of it (so El Nombre and Juan tell her to walk around it), a doll pushes three building blocks with the numbers 1-3 on them together (but a breakdown-truck-driving clown accidentally crashes into them and scatters them, so he has to help her rearrange them again), Darren and Sharon Jam cannot make a mutual decision on where to put their new table on ''Lucky Lottery Winners'', Mama has come out of Hurrell's store (but cannot help thinking there is another way around the hole, so El Nombre tells her that if she is brave like him, she can jump across it, but when he falls down it, she opts to go around it again instead), and Lord and Lady Posh give instructions to their gardener, Jarvis, on where he has to plant their roses and daisies.

*Episode 20: ''In, Out, and Through'' (27 March 1996)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1996-03-27 BBC Two England - 27 March 1996 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan has lost Tanto so El Nombre helps him and Mama to find him, the bear from the first episode tries to boil a saucepan of water over a fire but its bottom is missing, a magician turns her volunteer's watch and keys into an alarm clock and one big key, and two burglars named Bob and Bert break into a sweet shop and eat all the sweets but grow too fat to escape through the window so they get caught by a policeman named PC Nabb; from this point onwards, El Nombre also returned to one sketch per episode (except for in Episodes 21 and 26).

==Series 4: More or Less (Spring/Summer 1996)==

The fourth series, which is aimed at five- to six-year-olds, comprised eight episodes focusing on the concepts of "more than" ([[addition]]) and "less than" ([[subtraction]]); each episode would open with Lolita singing the series' main theme, ''More or Less'', in a studio filled with pillars. This series introduced the character of '''Bill''' (voiced by [[Paul Cawley]]), a green bird who could swallow and regurgitate almost any object whole - and from the fifth series onwards, he was joined by a purple cat named '''Bernie''' (voiced by [[Laura Brattan]]). This series also featured a toad named '''Test''', who would hop along the heads of fifteen multicoloured people lined up to form a numberline by the amounts its episodes were focusing on (they all wore red jumpers with the numbers 1-15 on them, but when Test was on their heads, the colour of their jumpers would change to green); each episode would end with Lolita singing a song (for the last one, she again continued over the credits, and it was also her final appearance, but because she did not know that she would be relieved of her presenting duties back then, she still told the viewers that she would "see them next Numbertime"). Two sketches in the first and seventh episodes of this series also parodied [[Percy Thrower]] and [[Sir David Attenborough]] as "Percy Grower" and "David Attencoat", while a third one in the third episode parodied ''[[Surprise Surprise (TV series)|Surprise, Surprise]]'' as "''What a Surprise''" (with [[Cinderella]] receiving a surprise visit from her [[Fairy Godmother]]) - and the ''Bill'' sketches of the second and sixth episodes also featured an enormous (but unnamed) beetle who chased after Bill after putting his feet into the eight wellingtons he regurgitated (in the second episode) and fell on top of him after pulling his last two wellingtoned legs up off a wall he was standing in front of (in the sixth episode), while the one of the fourth episode featured a "female" version of Bill who fell on top of him after he shook twenty mangoes off a tree. In the ''El Nombre'' sketches of the seventh and last episodes, Juan had his fifth birthday for the second time (only this time, Pedro, Juanita and Maria all brought him an extra candle for his cake because he was one year older, so he ended up with eight), and El Nombre's town gained a female mayor who also happened to be a balloon seller named '''Señora Fedora'''.

*Episode 25: ''One Less'' (15 May 1996)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1996-05-15 BBC Two England - 15 May 1996 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Episode 26: ''Two Less'' (22 May 1996)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1996-05-22 BBC Two England - 22 May 1996 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, this series was released on VHS as a "Video Plus Pack" by BBC Educational Publishing, and on 16 May 2013 it was rereleased on [[DVD]] as a "DVD Plus Pack" by BBC Active (as they are now known) with an accompanying teachers' book, but it is now out of print.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/products/barbara+allebone/numbertime+more+or+less+dvd+plus+pack/9562282 Waterstones.com - Numbertime More or Less DVD Plus Pack]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth series, which is aimed at four- to six-year-olds, comprised ten episodes focusing on time-related concepts; given that Lolita had been relieved of her presenting duties by this point, each episode was introduced by an animated man with a pocket watch for a head (who also appeared in a musical sketch at the end of the sixth episode). In this series, El Nombre's town was given the name of '''Santo &lt;!-- Note: Please do not change this to "Santa", as the voiceover at the start of the El Nombre single's video, which was added as a reference to stop the edit warring, clearly says "Deep in the heart of Mexico, there is a little town, called *Santo* Flamingo". --&gt; Flamingo''' (its name was first heard in the sixth episode in reference to their local football team, although the sign above the doorway of its newly built school read "'''San''' Flamingo School"),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfFcrLus5NQ YouTube - El Nombre Single]&lt;/ref&gt; and Juan gained a new teacher named '''Constanza Bonanza''' - and all except two of the episodes had sketches featuring a rarely speaking man named '''Tim''' (played by [[Toby Jones]]) who was coming to an understanding with time-related concepts (in fact, the only time he spoke was in the seventh episode, when he read out the text "Cook for half an hour" on the box of a big pie he had bought). This series also introduced the recurring sketch of the '''Dolls' House''', which featured a cowgirl named '''Annie''' (played by [[Victoria Gay]]), a scarecrow named '''Scrap''' (played by Paul Cawley), a robot named '''Glimmer''' (played by [[Ashley Artus]]), a clock named '''Ticker''' (played by [[Mike Hayley]]), and from the sixth series onwards, a butler named '''Branston''' (played by [[Brian Miller (actor)|Brian Miller]]); they were frequently visited by a pirate named '''Captain Kevin''' (played by [[Roger Griffiths]]), and on three occasions by a mechanic named '''Megamax''' (played by [[Fidel Nanton]]), Glimmer's girlfriend '''Princess Penelope''' (who had come to visit Scrap when he was ill and ate all his chocolates) and a Russian ballet dancer named '''Nadia Nokoblokov''' (who had come to perform [[Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin]]'s ''[[Minute Waltz]]''). For the seventh series, they were also frequently visited by a detective named '''Shelley Holmes''' (played by [[Issy Van Randwyck]]) - however, this recurring sketch would only go on until the end of that series. Although this series was made after the corporate change in Winter 1997 (as evidenced by the then-new BBC logo at the end of each episode), it was not broadcast until 13 January 1998.

This series and the next one were originally aired on Tuesdays as part of the then-newly renamed ''Schools Programmes'' strand at 9:45am.

In this first new-style episode, Tim wakes up in the middle of the night, brushes his teeth and pours himself a bowl of corn flakes (but has to wait until the morning for the milk), Little Juan wakes up all the other villagers because he does not know that a fiesta is held in the evening (rather than the morning or the afternoon), the residents of the Dolls' House take turns in getting their meals ready and Bill takes a Polaroid of both himself and his new co-star Bernie (who came in covered in mud, so he has to give her a bath before taking another one), but Bill got himself covered in mud while trying to get her in the bath, so she takes another Polaroid of him to show him.

*Episode 30: ''Days of the Week'' (20 January 1998)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1998-01-20 BBC Two England - 20 January 1998 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim sets off to referee a football match (but the forecast for that day is "windy", so he has to change into his best suit), Little Juan has football practice but cannot remember which day it is on, Bill decides to go on holiday to get away from the rain (but leaves Bernie behind with only seven cans of cat food, one for each day of the week, and a can opener) and Scrap and Glimmer get into an argument over a teddy bear so Captain Kevin has to sort it out; also, not only is the newspaper in this episode's ''Tim'' sketch dated from before the BBC's corporate change (10 April 1997), but it is factually incorrect, as it says that day was a Monday, when it was in fact a Thursday.

*Episode 31: ''Sequencing Events'' (27 January 1998)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1998-01-27 BBC Two England - 27 January 1998 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim tries to put on his new suit with a jacket, a pair of trousers, a hat, a pair of shoes, a pair of socks and a tie but keeps doing it in the wrong order, El Nombre helps Mama to make Delietta Smith (who is obviously a parody of [[Delia Smith]])'s wonderful omelette with red and green peppers, Bill wakes Bernie up for dinnertime but forgets all about the food, and Scrap and Glimmer try to make a chocolate splodge cake for Annie; this is also the first episode to refer to the Dolls' House by name, despite being the third one in this series.

*Episode 32: ''Comparison of Time'' (3 February 1998)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1998-02-03 BBC Two England - 3 February 1998 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim grows two flowers and photographs them but cannot wait for the third, Pedro bets Juan he can find a spider who is faster than Tanto, Bernie wants to get an apple off a tree but cannot reach it (so Bill offers to fly up there, but when he learns he cannot, he challenges her to a tower-building contest) and Megamax is coming for tea at the Dolls' House so Annie, Scrap and Glimmer have to paint it, but the latter runs down, so when Megamax arrives, he deduces that he needs a new battery and gives him the "Max Pack Turbo Booster" to fix him.

*Episode 33: ''Clock Face'' (10 February 1998)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1998-02-10 BBC Two England - 10 February 1998 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

El Nombre helps Little Juan to find out some things about the clock face for his homework, Scrap and Glimmer are bored so they decide to give Ticker's spring a big clean, and Bill trips over the sleeping Bernie and flies into his clock, causing all its numbers and both its hands to fall off; when he has put them all back on (with the help of Bernie), the clock's cuckoo calls at 3:00 and causes him to faint.

*Episode 34: ''O'Clock'' (24 February 1998)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1998-02-24 BBC Two England - 24 February 1998 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Little Juan and his friends prepare to go on a school outing to see Santo &lt;!-- Note: Please do not change this to "Santa", as the voiceover at the start of the El Nombre single's video, which was added as a reference to stop the edit warring, clearly says "Deep in the heart of Mexico, there is a little town, called *Santo* Flamingo". --&gt; Flamingo United playing in the cup final at 3:00, Bernie takes a nap at 2:00 but Bill plays a prank on her by moving the clock an hour ahead and waking her up by replacing the cuckoo, and Scrap waits for the postwoman to deliver his new "Scrap Jacket" (which he had been going on about all night and keeping Glimmer from getting sleep).

*Episode 35: ''Half Past'' (3 March 1998)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1998-03-03 BBC Two England - 3 March 1998 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim (saying his only line, "Cook for half an hour", in this episode) cooks a big pie he has bought, but gets bored while waiting so eats all his other groceries, Scrap is ill so Annie asks Glimmer to take his temperature every hour and give him his medicine every half-hour (but his girlfriend, Princess Penelope, comes to visit), Bernie is enjoying a "cattuccino" at the foot of a [[Big Ben]]-like clock tower until Bill bungee-jumps from its minute hand, steals it when he springs back up to its face, drinks it and returns the empty cup to her, and Pedro, Juanita, and Maria all agree to meet Juan for a game of football at 2:30 (but Juan wonders how he will know when it is 2:30).

*Episode 36: ''Timing of Events'' (10 March 1998)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1998-03-10 BBC Two England - 10 March 1998 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim has hiccups and tries to get rid of them by drinking a glass of water then holding his breath for ten seconds (but gets interrupted by a crank phone call the first time, and a crank door-caller the second time), San Flamingo School is holding a three-legged race as a part of their sports day, Bill and Bernie prepare to launch each other into outer space using only a seesaw, and Nadia Nokoblokov comes to visit the Dolls' House because she needs someone to help her out with her new dance (Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin's ''Minute Waltz'').

*Episode 37: ''Months and Seasons'' (17 March 1998)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1998-03-17 BBC Two England - 17 March 1998 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim receives a mysterious three-layered parcel on his doorstep in the middle of the night (which turns out to be a birthday cake) along with a musical [[birthday card]] (which plays a high-speed version of ''[[Happy Birthday to You]]'' to him), while El Nombre helps Juan and Juanita to put the four seasons in the right order for their homework (but they still have to draw a picture for each one), Bernie puts a smile on the face of a snowman (that turns out to be Bill) in winter, then the snow melts and some blossom grows on a tree in spring, Bill waters some flowers to help them grow and Bernie mows the lawn in summer, the leaves blow off the tree in autumn and Bernie throws a snowball at Bill and skates on the ice in winter before putting another smile on the face of another snowman (which, again, is Bill); the residents of the Dolls' House also have to organise their clothes for each season (but Glimmer thinks they are throwing them away).

*Episode 38: ''Telling the Time'' (24 March 1998)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1998-03-24 BBC Two England - 24 March 1998 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his last appearance, Tim is woken up by a train, then eats a bowl of corn flakes, drinks a cup of coffee and builds a house of cards as three more trains pass (the last one causes him to knock it down), Ticker is broken because Annie, Scrap and Glimmer did not oil him when he asked so Captain Kevin gives him one of his spare ship's bells as a replacement, Bill and Bernie test each other's knowledge of time with their clock (and Bill gets two of them wrong), and Miss Constanza Bonanza, Pedro, Juanita and Mama all remind Juan that it is choir practice at 4:30, it is football practice at 5:00, to come to her house for tea at 5:30, and to return home at 6:00 respectively.

The four shapes seen at the end of this series' episodes had been redesigned from those of the three previous ones, and were differently coloured to their originals as well (the circle was now green, the triangle was now yellow and the square was now red, but the rectangle kept its old-style colour of blue); also, in 1999, this series was released on VHS as a "Video Plus Pack" by BBC Educational Publishing.

==Series 6: Numbers 11 to 20 (Winter 1998, broadcast Spring 1999)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b8140c86f BFI - Numbertime: Numbers 11-20 (1998)]&lt;/ref&gt;==

&lt;!-- Do *not* re-add the false information about this series covering the numbers 13, 14, 16, 18 and 19 here, as it clearly did not. --&gt;
The sixth series (which is, again, aimed at five- to six-year-olds) comprised five episodes focusing on the numbers 11, 12, 15, 17 and 20, in order; they did not cover the numbers 13, 14, 16, 18 and 19 (except in their opening titles with images of thirteen blocks, fourteen pencils, sixteen leaves, eighteen buttons and nineteen crayons). Each episode would open with '''Bill''' and '''Bernie''' finding the position of the episode's number on their number line (which had been carried over from the "revised" version of the first series) - and in this series, Santo &lt;!-- Note: Please do not change this to "Santa", as the voiceover at the start of the El Nombre single's video, which was added as a reference to stop the edit warring, clearly says "Deep in the heart of Mexico, there is a little town, called *Santo* Flamingo". --&gt; Flamingo gained an ice-cream seller named '''Señor Gelato''', a carpenter named '''Señor Chipito''' (who had, once again, previously appeared in the second series as the owner of "The Maggot and Cactus" saloon) and a bandit named '''Don Fandango''' (who stole twenty gold coins from its newly built bank, which was managed by '''Señor Calculo''', in the last episode). This series also saw former ''[[Blue Peter]]'' host [[Janet Ellis]] joining the ''El Nombre'' cast; although this series was made in Winter 1998, it was not broadcast until 12 January 1999.

*Episode 39: ''Number 11'' (12 January 1999)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1999-01-12 BBC Two England - 12 January 1999 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleven soldiers (ten in two rows of five and the eleventh on the bottom) march around and ten of them make up the number eleven, Little Juan and his friends are preparing to go on a second school outing, this time to play a football match (but they only have ten football shirts, and El Nombre writes the episode's number in the desert sand), and Scrap receives a "[[Subbuteo|Soccerbox]]" football game from his great-aunt Laura Litterbin (but it disappoints him as he does not like football, and one of the eleven white players goes missing).

*Episode 40: ''Number 12'' (19 January 1999)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1999-01-19 BBC Two England - 19 January 1999 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Now in song, a pair of green slugs eat a gardener's twelve plants (that are in three rows of four) and make the number twelve, Juan bets Juanita that he can do more skips than her (he also mistakenly pronounces her surname as "Chiquita" in this episode) and Pedro bets both of them he can do more than either of them (but when doing it, he counts as fast as he can), and Captain Kevin does not want Branston to mention the number twelve as it reminds him of the final voyage of the good ship ''Rusty Bucket'' (when its crew found twelve biscuits).

*Episode 41: ''Number 15'' (26 January 1999)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1999-01-26 BBC Two England - 26 January 1999 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifteen cars (in three rows of five) go nowhere and nobody seems to care, Señor Gelato accidentally drives his ice-cream tricycle into a three-legged table that Mama had told Juan and Pedro to take in to Señor Chipito for repairing (and they have to get a replacement wheel with fifteen spokes, but Juan initially thinks that it has more as he cannot tell which one he had started counting from), and Scrap and Glimmer are playing marbles in the lounge of the Dolls' House (but Glimmer is losing, rather badly, and his ten red marbles go missing).

*Episode 42: ''Number 17'' (2 February 1999)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1999-02-02 BBC Two England - 2 February 1999 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventeen windows (sixteen of them in four rows of four and the seventeenth one on the door) open up on a flat to let in some air, Pedro accidentally kicks his ball into the path of Señor Gelato's ice-cream tricycle (which causes him to swerve and crash into Señor Manuel's cart, upsetting his display of seventeen tomatoes) while playing football with Juan, and all the residents of the Dolls' House prepare a surprise party for Captain Kevin but Scrap eats three lots of cake mix that is supposed to be enough for twenty cakes leaving seventeen.

*Episode 43: ''Number 20'' (9 February 1999)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1999-02-09 BBC Two England - 9 February 1999 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

A spaceship beams up twenty stars (that are in four rows of five) then beams them down again in the constellation of the number twenty, Don Fandango steals twenty gold coins from the bank of Santo &lt;!-- Note: Please do not change this to "Santa", as the voiceover at the start of the El Nombre single's video, which was added as a reference to stop the edit warring, clearly says "Deep in the heart of Mexico, there is a little town, called *Santo* Flamingo". --&gt; Flamingo (but Tanto bites a hole in his bag causing them all to fall out), and Nadia Nokoblokov pays another visit to the Dolls' House to perform another dance ("The Dance of Twenty Turns") in its conservatory; however, Ticker (whose role in the ''Dolls' House'' sketches had been lessened by this point) realises that if he stays in the bedroom, he does not have to watch, and Scrap eats a cake he had been told to put twenty candles on so Annie and Nadia punish him by putting him on the revolving podium that Nadia had brought with her for the dance and telling Glimmer to force him to do twenty "fast" turns on it. Clips from the first series (both incarnations) and the fourth series were also re-used in a musical sketch at the end of this episode.
&lt;!-- Do *not* re-add the false information about the non-existent "Episodes 69-73, focusing on the numbers 13, 14, 16, 18, and 19" here; this *five*-episode series finished on 9 February 1999, and has not been repeated since 2007. Given that the actual show itself finished in 2001, it is highly unlikely that five new episodes will ever be made just so that a vandal's nuisance edits will not be deleted. --&gt;

In 2000, both this series and the following one were released on VHS as "Video Plus Packs" by BBC Educational Publishing; on 4 May 2012, this one was rereleased on DVD as a "DVD Plus Pack" by BBC Active, with an accompanying teachers' book. The pack also contained an audio [[Compact disc|CD]], featuring songs from the series (and initially released as an [[audio cassette]]) - and this one is still in print.

==Series 7: Numbers up to 100 (Autumn/Winter 1999)==

The seventh series, which is once again aimed at five- to six-year-olds, comprised five episodes focusing on how to add and identify two-figure numbers up to 100; each episode would open with '''Bill''' and '''Bernie''', whose number line had been replaced by a number square, and joined by a caterpillar named '''Limo''' (voiced by [[Peter Temple]]), who would crawl around the square to count out the numbers they required. In Santo &lt;!-- Note: Please do not change this to "Santa", as the voiceover at the start of the El Nombre single's video, which was added as a reference to stop the edit warring, clearly says "Deep in the heart of Mexico, there is a little town, called *Santo* Flamingo". --&gt; Flamingo, Maria's sister '''Pepita Consuela Tequila Chiquita''' also started at San Flamingo School.

This series, which is the Dolls' House's last, was originally aired on Thursdays as part of the ''Schools Programmes'' strand at 10:50am.

Bernie stacks up twenty-nine plates (thrown to her by Bill), but does not know what comes after 29 so asks Limo to help; every time she stacks up ten more, she has to ask him again, but when she gets to 100, they fall over as a result of their weight. Scrap has also lost all except one of his fifty buttons so Shelley Holmes helps him to find them again, while Señor Gelato has only one cornet left so Juan volunteers to go down to Hurrell's store and get twenty-four more - but as he is about to set off, he is asked to get three extra ones.

*Episode 45: ''Missing Numbers'' (11 November 1999)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1999-11-11 BBC Two England - 11 November 1999 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

While dusting the number square, Bernie sneezes four of the numbers (18, 46, 69 and 83) out of it; after Limo has put them all back in, Bernie dusts Bill's beak, causing him to sneeze the entire number square over. Maria's sister Pepita also starts at San Flamingo School (which viewers see the inside of for the first time), while Glimmer cooks apple pie and custard (his Aunt Dimity's very own recipe) but Scrap has got the pages of his cookbook mixed up and Limo has to put four more numbers (24, 38, 77 and 96) back into the number square.

*Episode 46: ''Counting in Tens'' (18 November 1999)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1999-11-18 BBC Two England - 18 November 1999 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernie is tired so she decides to have forty winks, and Limo counts them by crawling along each row of the number square; Scrap is also tired of licking envelopes (containing invitations to Glimmer's birthday party), while Juan takes all the money that he has saved up in his [[Piggy bank|donkey bank]] to Santo &lt;!-- Note: Please do not change this to "Santa", as the voiceover at the start of the El Nombre single's video, which was added as a reference to stop the edit warring, clearly says "Deep in the heart of Mexico, there is a little town, called *Santo* Flamingo". --&gt; Flamingo Bank and Bill and Bernie ask Limo if he can find the numbers 30 and 90 and add on ten.

*Episode 47: ''Patterns of Ten'' (25 November 1999)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1999-11-25 BBC Two England - 25 November 1999 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill makes twelve sandwiches and ten iced buns for a party (and Bernie makes ten more of both, but they both make ten rock cakes each), while Scrap and Glimmer are making party bags for a party of their own, Señora Fedora opens the 15th Annual Santo &lt;!-- Note: Please do not change this to "Santa", as the voiceover at the start of the El Nombre single's video, which was added as a reference to stop the edit warring, clearly says "Deep in the heart of Mexico, there is a little town, called *Santo* Flamingo". --&gt;  Flamingo Egg Festival and chooses Mama to make its giant omelette (for which she needs sixty-one eggs but only has twenty-one) and Bill and Bernie eat thirty of the "goodies" that they have made for their party, but Bill drops the ten remaining buns and Bernie slides on their remains into him causing him to drop ten of the sandwiches, and when they decide to have a dance he throws the ten of the remaining twelve into the air.

*Episode 48: ''Patterns of Five'' (2 December 1999)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1999-12-02 BBC Two England - 2 December 1999 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill has been shopping and bought twenty packs of five fish fingers (but forgot the chips, as Bernie finds out once she has put them all in the freezer), while Glimmer is painting a five-dot pattern, and San Flamingo School is holding a jumble sale; this was also the final episode to feature the Dolls' House (and although it credits Victoria Gay at the end of it, she did not appear as Annie in this series).

==Series 8: Money (Autumn 2000)==

The eighth series, which is aimed at five- to seven-year-olds, comprised ten episodes focusing on coin recognition, money problems, coin equivalents and change (which the BBC had previously covered in the second series of their later primary maths show, ''[[Megamaths]]''); each episode would open with eight "money-spiders" (one for each coin - 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 and £2) coming down into view from the top of a tree. In this series, the currency of pounds and pence was introduced to Santo &lt;!-- Note: Please do not change this to "Santa", as the voiceover at the start of the El Nombre single's video, which was added as a reference to stop the edit warring, clearly says "Deep in the heart of Mexico, there is a little town, called *Santo* Flamingo". --&gt; Flamingo, which gained a railway station named '''El Loco''' and a pizza delivery boy named '''Leonardo de Sombrero''' - and the recurring song from the first series, ''Numbers All Around'', was also reworked (to focus on coins instead of numbers). This series also introduced the recurring sketch of '''Screensaver''', which featured a screen named '''Screen''' (voiced by [[Sue Elliott-Nicholls]]), a variety of customers (who were all played by one-time ''Spitting Image'' impressionist [[Michael Fenton-Stevens]]), and a robot named '''T1L''' (pronounced "Til", and played by [[Paul Vates]]).

This series was originally aired on each day of the working week for a fortnight as part of the ''Schools Programmes'' strand at 11:05am.

Juan, Mama and Pedro go to the fair (but do not know if they have the right money for the coconut shy, roundabout or candy floss), while Bill is running a cake stall but Bernie cannot decide whether she wants one or not so flips four coins (1p, 2p, 5p and 10p) into the air but they do not come down again, and a cricket player wants to buy some glue from Screensaver to stick his old broken bat back together.

*Episode 50: ''Money Problems to 10p'' (24 October 2000)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/2000-10-24 BBC Two England - 24 October 2000 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;''2p''

San Flamingo School is holding another jumble sale (this time to raise money for the new school bell), while Bill is now running a drink stall (but after he sells his last drink to Bernie for 8p, he has to close it, and Bernie then disguises herself as a vending machine to trick Bill into giving her money back), and a policeman wants to buy a timepiece from Screensaver (who try to sell him Big Ben for 10p).

*Episode 51: ''Coin Equivalents to 10p'' (25 October 2000)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/2000-10-25 BBC Two England - 25 October 2000 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;''5p''

Little Juan and his friends are going to Santo &lt;!-- Note: Please do not change this to "Santa", as the voiceover at the start of the El Nombre single's video, which was added as a reference to stop the edit warring, clearly says "Deep in the heart of Mexico, there is a little town, called *Santo* Flamingo". --&gt; Flamingo National Park to see the Giant Cactus, while Bill is now running an "everything" stall (but when Bernie manages to scrape 10p together from a 5p coin, two 2p coins and a 1p coin, she wheels it away after misconstruing the meaning of "everything 10p"), and a sailor wants to buy a cake for his mother from Screensaver (who try to sell him a wedding cake).

*Episode 52: ''Change from 10p'' (26 October 2000)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/2000-10-26 BBC Two England - 26 October 2000 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;''10p''

Little Juan and his friends have now arrived at Santo &lt;!-- Note: Please do not change this to "Santa", as the voiceover at the start of the El Nombre single's video, which was added as a reference to stop the edit warring, clearly says "Deep in the heart of Mexico, there is a little town, called *Santo* Flamingo". --&gt; Flamingo National Park and seen the Giant Cactus, while Bill and Bernie are hungry so they buy a snack for 5p, a carton of juice for 2p and a bar of chocolate for 3p (from three talking vending machines), and an old man wants to buy a new wheel for his wheel-basket from Screensaver because the old one is broken (and they try to sell him a bicycle wheel).

*Episode 53: ''Coin Equivalents to 20p'' (27 October 2000)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/2000-10-27 BBC Two England - 27 October 2000 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;''20p''

Juan and Juanita notice that Señor Manuel has put up a giant jellybean machine outside Hurrell's store, while Bernie plays "Coin Sports" and loses Bill's 1p, 2p, 5p and 10p coins after they have rolled into a river (making 18p altogether), and a Russian secret agent wishes to change his appearance at Screensaver (who sell him a Hawaiian shirt for 4p, a blond wig for 8p and a striped bow tie for another 8p).

*Episode 54: ''Change from 20p'' (30 October 2000)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/2000-10-30 BBC Two England - 30 October 2000 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;''1p – 20p''

Mama takes Juan back-to-school shopping at Hurrell's store (and has him try on a hat which is too big for him), while Bernie pays 20p to go on an elephant ride and gets 5p change (but she finds it slow, so pays another 20p to go on a rocket ride and gets another 5p change, then masquerades as a cat ride in order to trick Bill into giving her a third 5p, and after Bill does that and she gives him the ride of his life, he wants to do it again, but she is tired out so she does not), and a chef wants to buy some butter and eggs from Screensaver.

*Episode 55: ''Coin Equivalents to 50p'' (31 October 2000)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/2000-10-31 BBC Two England - 31 October 2000 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;''50p''

Señor Gelato promises Juan and Juanita an ice-cream if they go to the Santo &lt;!-- Note: Please do not change this to "Santa", as the voiceover at the start of the El Nombre single's video, which was added as a reference to stop the edit warring, clearly says "Deep in the heart of Mexico, there is a little town, called *Santo* Flamingo". --&gt; Flamingo Bank and get him some coins in exchange for the 50p he gave them, while Bill and Bernie try to get out of a car park (but when Bill has scraped 50p together, the barrier catapults him into the air), and a businessman wishes to buy a pet from Screensaver (who try to sell him a "Starpet", from their own home planet, for 50p).

*Episode 56: ''Change from 50p'' (1 November 2000)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/2000-11-01 BBC Two England - 1 November 2000 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;''1p – 50p''

Miss Bonanza is getting married (and Juan is responsible for the school's collection of 50p with which to buy her a present), while Bill pays 50p to have his photograph taken and gets 20p change (but it takes it before he can go inside the booth, so Bernie pays another 50p to have her photograph taken while Bill counts her change, but when she looks out of the booth to ask why it is taking so long, it takes a photograph of her tail, so they then combine their changes to have their photograph taken together), and a rock star wants to buy some new shoes from Screensaver because his old ones just "aren't his scene" (and they sell him a pair of blue suede platforms for 15p each).

*Episode 57: ''Coin Equivalents to £1'' (2 November 2000)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/2000-11-02 BBC Two England - 2 November 2000 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;''£1''

Pedro, Juanita and Maria are sleeping over at Juan's house (and planning to watch a really scary film), while Bill and Bernie are doing their laundry (and have to pay 10p for washing powder in addition to £1 for the washing machine, but when Bernie inserts a £1 coin into the washing powder machine, she gets ten cups, and because she pours them all into the washing machine, it starts spewing foam all over the floor of the launderette) and a cowboy named Tom (nicknamed "Big T") wishes to buy a shirt with a big ''T'' on it from Screensaver.

*Episode 58: ''Up to £2'' (3 November 2000)&lt;ref&gt;[http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/2000-11-03 BBC Two England - 3 November 2000 - BBC Genome]&lt;/ref&gt;''£2''

Little Juan is to perform a concert to raise more money for the school bell (with Don Fandango masquerading as Mama and trying to steal all his earnings), while Bill and Bernie want to go on a boat trip for £2 (but although Bernie has a £2 coin, they both have to go back home so Bill can scrape it together in other coins, and when they get back to the boat, Bernie gets on it before it pulls out, but Bill is not so lucky because he had to carry all his coins back there in a giant sack), and a non-speaking clown tries to get Screen and T1L (in their last appearance) to guess that he wants to buy a top hat (for 50p) and a rabbit to pull out of it (for £1.50) at Screensaver.

In 2001, by which point VHS was becoming obsolete, this series was released on VHS as a "Video Plus Pack" by BBC Educational Publishing.

==Series 9: Addition and Subtraction (Autumn/Winter 2001)==

The ninth (and final) series, which is aimed at six- to seven-year-olds, comprised ten episodes focusing on the concepts of adding and subtracting similar to the fourth series (only without Lolita, live-action sketches based on nursery rhymes, or Test the Toad); in this series, '''Numbertime News''', which had appeared in five episodes of the first series with '''Sammy Sport''' (played by [[Andy McEwan (actor)|Andy McEwan]], who had played Matt Dillon in ''Death Without Dishonour'', the twenty-sixth episode of ''[[Taggart (TV series)|Taggart]]''), along with one episode of the fourth series with '''Rebecca Testament''' (played by Issy Van Randwyck), became a recurring sketch, with anchorwoman '''Tara Boomdeay''' (played by [[Elisabeth Sladen]], who had played Sarah-Jane on ''Doctor Who'', as well as several characters in fifteen episodes over the third and aforementioned fourth series) and roving reporter '''Brad Quiff''' (played by [[Ian Connaughton]]). This series also saw Michael Fenton-Stevens returning to join the ''El Nombre'' cast and introduced the character of '''Addem''' (voiced by [[Richard Pearce (British actor)|Richard Pearce]]), a green snake who discovered the series' concept in the company of a yellow ant named '''Ann''' (voiced by [[Moir Leslie]]) and a whole civilisation of other multi-coloured ants (mostly voiced by both [[Brian Bowles (voice actor)|Brian Bowles]] and Richard Pearce, but the Queen Ant was again voiced by Moir Leslie).

This series was originally screened on Mondays as part of the ''Schools Programmes'' strand at 11:05am, but 1 October 2001 was the first day of that year's four-day [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] Conference, so its fourth episode was not shown until the following week.

&lt;!-- Do *not* change any of the air dates in this, or any other, section, as they all now have a reference to their original listings in their weeks' Radio Times on their BBC Genome pages; there is really no reason for any of the sections' headers to be changed either. --&gt;

In 2002, by which time VHS was even more obsolete, this series was released on VHS as a "Video Plus Pack" by BBC Educational Publishing.

==Radio series==
The first series was accompanied by a ten-part radio series on [[BBC School Radio]] entitled ''Radio Numbertime'', which again focused on the numbers 1-10, in order; it ran from 21 September to 30 November 1993. Another radio series, which was entitled simply ''Numbertime'' like the television series, was broadcast on BBC School Radio from 29 September 2000 to 26 March 2003 - and a third radio series, which was again entitled ''Numbertime'' like the defunct television series, was broadcast on BBC School Radio from 1 May to 26 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01wrmhd BBC - Schools Radio - Numbertime]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7106">[[Image:Paul Tannery.jpg|thumb|Paul Tannery]]
'''Paul Tannery''' (20 December 1843 – 27 November 1904) was a [[France|French]] [[Mathematics|mathematician]] and [[History of Mathematics|historian of mathematics]]. He was the older brother of mathematician [[Jules Tannery]], to whose ''Notions Mathématiques'' he contributed an historical chapter.  Though Tannery's career was in the [[tobacco]] industry, he devoted his evenings and his life to the study of mathematicians and mathematical development.

==Life and career==
Tannery was born in [[Mantes-la-Jolie]] on 20 December 1843, to a deeply [[Catholic]] family.  He attended private school in Mantes, followed by the [[Lycée]]s in Le Mans and [[Caen]]. He then entered the [[École Polytechnique]], on whose entrance exam he excelled.  His curriculum included mathematics, the sciences, and the classics, all of which would be represented in his future academic work.  Tannery's life of public service began as he then entered the École d'Applications des Tabacs as an apprentice engineer.

As an assistant engineer, Tannery spent two years in the state tobacco factory at [[Lille]].  In 1867, he moved to [[Paris]]; three years later, he served as an artillery captain in the [[Franco-Prussian War]].  Biographies of Tannery describe him as an ardent patriot and claim that he never fully accepted the humiliating [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]].

After his graduation from the École Polytechnique, Tannery had become interested in [[Auguste Comte]] and his [[Positivism|positivist]] philosophy.  After the war, his interest in mathematics continued, and Comte's ideas would influence his approach to the study of the history of science.  Tannery moved several times with his career in the tobacco industry: to Périgord in 1872, to [[Bordeaux]] in 1874, to [[Le Havre]] in 1877, and to Paris in 1883.  Bordeaux had something of an intellectual atmosphere, and though Tannery moved to Le Havre (near his parents, who lived at Caen) at his own request, he would also directly request the move to Paris, where his research and academic pursuits would be able to flourish.

It was in Paris that Tannery took on his first two major editorial works.  In 1883, he began an edition of [[Diophantus]]'s manuscripts, and in 1885, he and [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]] began an edition of one of [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]]'s works.  This work was made possible by access to the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], and so Tannery had to reduce his efforts in 1886 when he was transferred to Tonneins.  Even without access to the Bibliothèque, Tannery remained hard at work, however, as he published two books composed of articles he had been writing for the ''[[Revue philosophique de la France et de l'étranger]]'' and for the ''Bulletin de sciences mathematiques''.

In 1888, Tannery moved back to Bordeaux, where he studied Greek astronomy and directed the tobacco factory.  Two years later, he was back in Paris; he would remain near Paris until his death.  Despite a heavy professional workload, he continued to be productive in his work in the history of science.  His editions of Diophantus and Fermat were published, along with over 250 articles.  From 1890 forward, Tannery's other major work focused on a new edition of [[René Descartes|Descartes]]'s works and correspondence, on which he collaborated with Charles Adam, an historian of modern philosophy.

Scandal arose in 1903 when the [[Collège de France]] began a search for a new professor of the history of science.  Tannery was considered something of a shoe-in; he even began writing his inaugural lecture.  Instead, the position went to [[Grigorii Nikolayevich Vyrubov|Grégoire Wyrouboff]], who concentrated on modern mathematicians instead of Tannery's classical and seventeenth-century idols.  Wyrouboff was also a freethinker, an asset to the secularist [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], while Tannery was Catholic.

Tannery died soon thereafter, on 27 November 1904, in [[Pantin]], just outside Paris.  His wife, Marie, would survive until 1945, and she published several of his works posthumously, helping to ensure that his legacy would live on.

He was an Invited Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1904 in Heidelberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tannery, P.|chapter=''Pour l'histoire du problème inverse des tangentes''|pages=502–514|title=Verhandlungen des dritten Mathematiker-Kongresses in Heidelberg von 8. bis 13.

In modern [[mathematics]], a '''point''' refers usually to an [[Element (mathematics)|element]] of some [[Set (mathematics)|set]] called a [[Space (mathematics)|space]].

More specifically, in [[Euclidean geometry]], a point is a [[primitive notion]] upon which the geometry is built, meaning that a point cannot be defined in terms of previously defined objects. That is, a point is defined only by some properties, called [[axiom]]s, that it must satisfy. In particular, the geometric points do not have any [[length]], [[area]], [[volume]] or any other [[dimension]]al attribute. A common interpretation is that the concept of a point is meant to capture the notion of a unique location in [[Euclidean space]].

==Points in Euclidean geometry==
[[Image:ACP 3.svg|thumb|A finite set of points (blue) in two-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].]]
Points, considered within the framework of [[Euclidean geometry]], are one of the most fundamental objects. [[Euclid]] originally defined the point as "that which has no part". In two-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], a point is represented by an [[ordered pair]] ({{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}) of numbers, where the first number [[Convention (norm)|conventionally]] represents the [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] and is often denoted by {{mvar|x}}, and the second number conventionally represents the [[Vertical direction|vertical]] and is often denoted by {{mvar|y}}. This idea is easily generalized to three-dimensional Euclidean space, where a point is represented by an ordered triplet ({{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, {{mvar|z}}) with the additional third number representing depth and often denoted by {{mvar|z}}. Further generalizations are represented by an ordered [[tuple]]t of {{mvar|n}} terms, {{math|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, … , ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} where {{mvar|n}} is the [[dimension (mathematics)|dimension]] of the space in which the point is located.

Many constructs within Euclidean geometry consist of an [[infinity|infinite]] collection of points that conform to certain axioms.  This is usually represented by a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of points; As an example, a [[line (mathematics)|line]] is an infinite set of points of the form &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle {L = \lbrace (a_1,a_2,...a_n)|a_1c_1 + a_2c_2 + ... a_nc_n = d \rbrace}&lt;/math&gt;, where {{math|''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} through {{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{mvar|d}} are constants and {{mvar|n}} is the dimension of the space. Similar constructions exist that define the [[plane (geometry)|plane]], [[line segment]] and other related concepts. A line segment consisting of only a single point is called a [[degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate]] line segment.

In addition to defining points and constructs related to points, Euclid also postulated a key idea about points, that any two points can be connected by a straight line. This is easily confirmed under modern extensions of Euclidean geometry, and had lasting consequences at its introduction, allowing the construction of almost all the geometric concepts known at the time. However, Euclid's postulation of points was neither complete nor definitive, and he occasionally assumed facts about points that did not follow directly from his axioms, such as the ordering of points on the line or the existence of specific points. In spite of this, modern expansions of the system serve to remove these assumptions.

==Dimension of a point==

There are several inequivalent definitions of [[dimension (mathematics and physics)|dimension]]  in mathematics. In all of the common definitions, a point is 0-dimensional.

=== Vector space dimension ===
{{Main|Dimension (vector space)}}

The dimension of a vector space is the maximum size of a [[linearly independent]] subset. In a vector space consisting of a single point (which must be the zero vector '''0'''), there is no linearly independent subset. The zero vector is not itself linearly independent, because there is a non trivial linear combination making it zero: &lt;math&gt;1 \cdot \mathbf{0}=\mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Topological dimension===
{{Main|Lebesgue covering dimension}}

The topological dimension of a topological space ''X'' is defined to be the minimum value of ''n'', such that every finite [[open cover]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; of ''X'' admits a finite open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; of ''X'' which [[refinement (topology)|refines]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; in which no point is included in more than ''n''+1 elements. If no such minimal ''n'' exists, the space is said to be of infinite covering dimension.

A point is [[zero-dimensional space|zero-dimensional]] with respect to the covering dimension because every open cover of the space has a refinement consisting of a single open set.

=== Hausdorff dimension ===
Let ''X'' be a [[metric space]]. If ''S'' ⊂ ''X'' and ''d'' ∈ [0, ∞), the ''d''-dimensional '''Hausdorff content''' of ''S'' is the [[infimum]] of the set of numbers δ ≥ 0 such that there is some (indexed) collection of [[metric space|balls]] &lt;math&gt;\{B(x_i,r_i):i\in I\}&lt;/math&gt; covering ''S'' with ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 0 for each ''i'' ∈ ''I'' that satisfies &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in I} r_i^d&lt;\delta &lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Hausdorff dimension''' of ''X'' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{dim}_{\operatorname{H}}(X):=\inf\{d\ge 0: C_H^d(X)=0\}.&lt;/math&gt;

A point has Hausdorff dimension 0 because it can be covered by a single ball of arbitrarily small radius.

==Geometry without points==

Although the notion of a point is generally considered fundamental in mainstream geometry and topology, there are some systems that forgo it, e.g. [[noncommutative geometry]] and [[pointless topology]]. A "pointless" or "pointfree" space is defined not as a [[set (mathematics)|set]], but via some structure ([[C*-algebra|algebraic]] or [[complete Heyting algebra|logical]] respectively) which looks like a well-known function space on the set: an algebra of [[continuous function]]s or an [[algebra of sets]] respectively. More precisely, such structures generalize well-known spaces of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] in a way that the operation "take a value at this point" may not be defined.
A further tradition starts from some books of [[A. N. Whitehead]] in which the notion of region is assumed as a primitive together with the one of ''inclusion'' or ''connection''.

==Point masses and the Dirac delta function ==
{{Main|Dirac delta function}}

Often in physics and mathematics, it is useful to think of a point as having non-zero mass or charge (this is especially common in [[classical electromagnetism]], where electrons are idealized as points with non-zero charge). The '''Dirac delta function''', or '''{{mvar|δ}} function''', is (informally) a [[generalized function]] on the real number line that is zero everywhere except at zero, with an [[integral]] of one over the entire real line.&lt;ref name=Dirac1958p58&gt;{{harvnb|Dirac|1958|loc=§15 The δ function}}, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gel'fand|Shilov|1968|loc=Volume I, §§1.1, 1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1950|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The delta function is sometimes thought of as an infinitely high, infinitely thin spike at the origin, with total area one under the spike, and physically represents an idealized [[point mass]] or [[point charge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arfken|Weber|2000|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was introduced by theoretical physicist [[Paul Dirac]].  In the context of [[signal processing]] it is often referred to as the '''unit impulse symbol''' (or function).&lt;ref name="Bracewell 1986 loc=Chapter 5"&gt;{{harvnb|Bracewell|1986|loc=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its discrete analog is the [[Kronecker delta]] function which is usually defined on a finite domain and takes values 0 and 1.

[[Image:Disk to Sphere using Quotient Space.gif|thumb|Illustration of quotient space, [[N-sphere|{{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}]], obtained by ''gluing'' the boundary (in blue) of the [[Disk (mathematics)|disk]] {{math|''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} together to a single point.]]
In [[topology]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], a '''quotient space''' (also called an '''identification space''') is, intuitively speaking, the result of identifying or "gluing together" certain points of a given [[topological space]]. The points to be identified are specified by an [[equivalence relation]]. This is commonly done in order to construct new spaces from given ones. The '''quotient topology''' consists of all sets with an [[open set|open]] [[preimage]] under the [[canonical projection map]] that maps each element to its equivalence class.

== Definition ==
Let {{math|(''X'', ''τ''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} be a [[topological space]], and let {{math|~}} be an [[equivalence relation]] on {{math|''X''}}. The '''quotient space''', {{math|1=''Y'' = ''X'' / ~}} is defined to be the set of [[equivalence class]]es of elements of {{math|''X''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;Y = \Big\{ [x] : x \in X \Big\} = \Big\{\{v \in X : v \sim x\} : x \in X\Big\},&lt;/math&gt;
equipped with the topology where the open sets are defined to be those sets of equivalence classes whose unions are open sets in ''X'':
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_Y = \Bigl\{ {\textstyle U \subseteq Y : \bigcup U = \bigl( \bigcup_{ [a] \in U} [a] \bigr) \in \tau_X }\Bigr\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, we can define them to be those sets with an open preimage under the surjective map {{math|''q'' : ''X'' → ''X'' / ~}}, which sends a point in {{math|''X''}} to the equivalence class containing it:
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_Y=\left\{ U \subseteq Y : q^{-1}(U) \in \tau_X \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
The quotient topology is the [[final topology]] on the quotient space with respect to the  map {{math|''q''}}.

== Quotient map ==
A map &lt;math&gt;f: X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; is a '''quotient map''' (sometimes called an '''identification map''') if it is [[surjective function|surjective]], and a subset ''U'' of ''Y'' is open if and only if &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; is open. Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a quotient map if it is onto and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is equipped with the [[final topology]]  with respect to  &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

Given an equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, the canonical map &lt;math&gt;q: X \to X/{\sim}&lt;/math&gt; is a quotient map.

== Examples ==
*'''Gluing'''.  Topologists talk of gluing points together.  If ''X'' is a topological space and points &lt;math&gt;x,y \in X&lt;/math&gt; are to be "glued", then what is meant is that we are to consider the quotient space obtained from the equivalence relation {{nowrap|''a'' ~ ''b''}} if and only if {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b''}} or {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''x'', ''b'' = ''y''}} (or {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''y'', ''b'' = ''x''}}).
*Consider the unit square {{nowrap|1=''I''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = [0,1] × [0,1]}} and the equivalence relation ~ generated by the requirement that all boundary points be equivalent, thus identifying all boundary points to a single equivalence class. Then ''I''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/~ is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[sphere|unit sphere]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
*'''[[Adjunction space]]'''. More generally, suppose ''X'' is a space and ''A'' is a [[subspace (topology)|subspace]] of ''X''. One can identify all points in ''A'' to a single equivalence class and leave points outside of ''A'' equivalent only to themselves. The resulting quotient space is denoted ''X''/''A''. The 2-sphere is then homeomorphic to the unit disc with its boundary identified to a single point: &lt;math&gt;D^{2}/\partial{D^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.
*Consider the set &lt;math&gt;X = \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; of all [[real number]]s with the ordinary topology, and write {{nowrap|1=''x'' ~ ''y''}} [[if and only if]] {{nowrap|''x'' − ''y''}} is an [[integer]]. Then the quotient space ''X''/~ is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[unit circle]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; via the homeomorphism which sends the equivalence class of ''x'' to exp(2π''ix'').
*A generalization of the previous example is the following: Suppose a [[topological group]] ''G'' [[group action|acts]] continuously on a space ''X''. One can form an equivalence relation on ''X'' by saying points are equivalent if and only if they lie in the same [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]]. The quotient space under this relation is called the '''orbit space''', denoted ''X''/''G''. In the previous example {{nowrap|1=''G'' = '''Z'''}} acts on '''R''' by translation. The orbit space '''R'''/'''Z''' is homeomorphic to ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

''Note'': The notation '''R'''/'''Z''' is somewhat ambiguous. If '''Z''' is understood to be a group acting on '''R''' via addition, then the [[Quotient group|quotient]] is the circle. However, if '''Z''' is thought of as a subspace of '''R''', then the quotient is a countably infinite [[bouquet of circles]] joined at a single point.

== Properties ==
Quotient maps {{nowrap|''q'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} are characterized among surjective maps by the following property: if ''Z'' is any topological space and {{nowrap|''f'' : ''Y'' → ''Z''}} is any function, then ''f'' is continuous if and only if {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''q''}} is continuous.

[[Image:QuotientSpace-01.svg|center|Characteristic property of the quotient topology]]

The quotient space ''X''/~ together with the quotient map {{nowrap|''q'' : ''X'' → ''X''/~}} is characterized by the following [[universal property]]: if {{nowrap|''g'' : ''X'' → ''Z''}} is a continuous map such that {{nowrap|''a'' ~ ''b''}} implies {{nowrap|1=''g''(''a'') = ''g''(''b'')}} for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''X'', then there exists a unique continuous map {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X''/~ → ''Z''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''g'' = ''f'' ∘ ''q''}}. We say that ''g'' ''descends to the quotient''.

The continuous maps defined on ''X''/~ are therefore precisely those maps which arise from continuous maps defined on ''X'' that respect the equivalence relation (in the sense that they send equivalent elements to the same image). This criterion is copiously used when studying quotient spaces.

Given a continuous surjection {{nowrap|''q'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} it is useful to have criteria by which one can determine if ''q'' is a quotient map. Two sufficient criteria are that ''q'' be [[open map|open]] or [[closed map|closed]]. Note that these conditions are only [[sufficient condition|sufficient]], not [[necessary condition|necessary]]. It is easy to construct examples of quotient maps that are neither open nor closed. For topological groups, the  quotient map is open.

== Compatibility with other topological notions ==
* [[Separation axioms|Separation]]
** In general, quotient spaces are ill-behaved with respect to separation axioms. The separation properties of ''X'' need not be inherited by ''X''/~, and ''X''/~ may have separation properties not shared by ''X''.
** ''X''/~ is a [[T1 space]] if and only if every equivalence class of ~ is closed in ''X''.
** If the quotient map is [[open map|open]], then ''X''/~ is a [[Hausdorff space]] if and only if ~ is a closed subset of the [[product space]] ''X''&amp;times;''X''.
* [[Connectedness]]
** If a space is connected or [[path connected]], then so are all its quotient spaces.
** A quotient space of a [[simply connected]] or [[contractible]] space need not share those properties.
* [[Compact space|Compactness]]
** If a space is compact, then so are all its quotient spaces.
** A quotient space of a [[locally compact]] space need not be locally compact.
* [[Dimension]]

The [[Rayleigh's quotient]] represents a quick method to estimate the natural [[frequency]] of a multi-degree-of-freedom vibration system, in which the [[mass]] and the stiffness matrices are known.

The [[eigenvalue]] problem for a general system of the form

: &lt;math&gt;M\,\ddot{\textbf{q}}(t) + C\,\dot{\textbf{q}}(t) + K\,\textbf{q}(t) = \textbf{Q}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

in absence of damping and external forces reduces to

: &lt;math&gt; M\,\ddot{\textbf{q}}(t) + K\,\textbf{q}(t) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The previous equation can be written also as

: &lt;math&gt;K\,\textbf{u} = \lambda\,M\,\textbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \lambda=\omega^2 &lt;/math&gt;, in which &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; represents the natural frequency, M and K are the real positive symmetric mass and stiffness matrices respectively.

For an ''n''-degree-of-freedom system the equation has ''n'' solutions &lt;math&gt; \lambda_m &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \textbf{u}_m &lt;/math&gt; that satisfy the equation

: &lt;math&gt; K\,\textbf{u}_m = \lambda_m\,M\,\textbf{u}_m &lt;/math&gt;

By multiplying both sides of the equation  by &lt;math&gt; \textbf{u}_{m}^{T} &lt;/math&gt; and dividing by the scalar &lt;math&gt; \textbf{u}_m^T\,M\,\textbf{u}_m &lt;/math&gt;, it is possible to express the eigenvalue problem as follow:

: &lt;math&gt; \lambda_m = \omega_m^2 = \frac{\textbf{u}_m^T\,K\,\textbf{u}_m}{\textbf{u}_m^T\,M\,\textbf{u}_m} &lt;/math&gt;
for ''m'' = 1,2,3,...,''n''.

In the previous equation it is also possible to observe that the numerator is proportional to the potential energy while the denominator depicts a measure of the kinetic energy. Moreover, the equation allow us to calculate the natural frequency only if the eigenvector (as well as any other displacement vector) &lt;math&gt; \textbf{u}_{m} &lt;/math&gt; is known. For academic interests, if the modal vectors are not known, we can repeat the foregoing process but with &lt;math&gt; \lambda = \omega^2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \textbf{u} &lt;/math&gt; taking the place of &lt;math&gt; \lambda_{m} = \omega_{m}^2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \textbf{u}_{m} &lt;/math&gt;, respectively. By doing so we obtain the scalar &lt;math&gt; R(\textbf{u}) &lt;/math&gt;, also known as Rayleigh's quotient:

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meirovitch|first1=Leonard|title=Fundamentals of Vibration|date=2003|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9780071219839|pages=806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;R(\textbf{u}) = \lambda = \omega^2 =  \frac{\textbf{u}^T\,K\,\textbf{u}}{\textbf{u}^T\,M\,\textbf{u}}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the Rayleigh's quotient is a scalar whose value depends on the vector &lt;math&gt; \textbf{u} &lt;/math&gt; and it can be calculated with good approximation for any arbitrary vector &lt;math&gt; \textbf{u} &lt;/math&gt; as long as it lays reasonably far from the modal vectors &lt;math&gt; \textbf{u}_{i} &lt;/math&gt;, ''i'' = 1,2,3,...,''n''.

Since, is it possible to state that the vector &lt;math&gt; \textbf{u} &lt;/math&gt; differs from the modal vector &lt;math&gt; \textbf{u}_m &lt;/math&gt; by a small quantity of first order, the correct result of the Rayleigh's quotient will differ not sensitively from the estimated one and that's what makes this method very useful. A good way to estimate the lowest modal vector &lt;math&gt; (u_1) &lt;/math&gt;, that generally works well for most structures (even though is not guaranteed), is to assume &lt;math&gt; (u_1) &lt;/math&gt; equal to the static displacement from an applied force that has the same relative distribution of the diagonal mass matrix terms. The latter can be elucidated by the following 3-DOF example.

== Example – 3DOF ==

As an example, we can consider a 3-degree-of-freedom system in which the mass and the stiffness matrices of them are known as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;M = 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 &amp; 3
  \end{pmatrix}
\; \;
K = 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    3 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \\
    -1 &amp; 3 &amp; -2 \\
    0 &amp; -2 &amp; 2
  \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

To get an estimation of the lowest natural frequency we choose a trial vector of static displacement obtained by loading the system with a force proportional to the masses:

: &lt;math&gt;\textbf{F} = k[m_1\, m_2\, m_3]^T = 1[1\, 1\, 3]&lt;/math&gt; 

Thus, the trial vector will become

: &lt;math&gt;\textbf{u} = K^{-1}\textbf{F} = [2.5;6.5;8]&lt;/math&gt;

that allow us to calculate the Rayleigh's quotient:

&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{\textbf{u}^T\,K\,\textbf{u}}{\textbf{u}^T\,M\,\textbf{u}} = \cdots = 0.137214&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the lowest natural frequency, calculated by means of Rayleigh's quotient is:

: &lt;math&gt;w_\text{Ray} = 0.370424&lt;/math&gt;

Using a calculation tool is pretty fast to verify how much it differs from the "real" one. In this case, using MATLAB, it has been calculated that the lowest natural frequency is: &lt;math&gt;w_\text{real} = 0.369308&lt;/math&gt; that has led to an error of &lt;math&gt;0.302315 \%&lt;/math&gt; using the Rayleigh's approximation, that is a remarkable result.

The example shows how the Rayleigh's quotient is capable of getting an accurate estimation of the lowest natural frequency. The practice of using the static displacement vector as a trial vector is valid as the static displacement vector tends to resemble the lowest vibration mode.

In [[mathematical logic]], and particularly in its subfield [[model theory]], a '''saturated model''' ''M'' is one which realizes as many [[type (model theory)|complete type]]s as may be "reasonably expected" given its size.  For example, an ultrapower model of the [[hyperreals]] is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;-saturated, meaning that every descending nested sequence of [[internal set]]s has a nonempty intersection, see Goldblatt (1998).

==Definition==
Let κ be a [[finite set|finite]] or [[Infinity|infinite]] [[cardinal number]] and ''M'' a model in some [[first-order language]].  Then ''M'' is called '''κ-saturated''' if  for all subsets ''A'' ⊆ ''M'' of [[cardinality]] less than κ, ''M'' realizes all [[Type (model theory)|complete types]]  over ''A''. The model ''M'' is called '''saturated''' if  it is |''M''|-saturated where |''M''| denotes the cardinality of ''M''. That is, it realizes all complete types over sets of parameters of size less than |''M''|. According to some authors, a model ''M'' is called '''countably saturated''' if  it is [[aleph-1 | &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;]]-saturated; that is, it realizes all complete types over countable sets of parameters. According to others, it is countably saturated if it is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;-saturated; i.e. realizes all complete types over finite parameter sets.

==Motivation==
{{Technical|section|date=January 2010}}
The seemingly more intuitive notion – that all complete types of the language are realized – turns out to be too weak (and is, appropriately, named '''weak saturation''', which is the same as 1-saturation).  The difference lies in the fact that many structures contain elements which are not definable (for example, any [[transcendental number|transcendental]] element of '''R''' is, by definition of the word, not definable in the field language).  However, they still form a part of the structure, so we need types to describe relationships with them.  Thus we allow sets of parameters from the structure in our definition of types.  This argument allows us to discuss specific features of the model which we may otherwise miss – for example, a ''specific'' increasing sequence ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' having a bound can be expressed as realizing the type {{nowrap|{''x'' &gt; ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''n'' ∈ ω},}} which uses countably many parameters.  If the sequence is not definable, this fact about the structure cannot be described using the base language, so a weakly saturated structure may not bound the sequence, while an ω-saturated structure will.

The reason we only require parameter sets which are strictly smaller than the model is trivial: without this restriction, no infinite model is saturated.  Consider a model ''M'', and the type {{nowrap|{''x'' ≠ ''m'' : ''m'' ∈ ''M''}.}}  Each finite subset of this type is realized in the (infinite) model ''M'', so by compactness it is consistent with ''M'', but is trivially not realized.  Any definition which is universally unsatisfied is useless; hence the restriction.

==Examples==
Saturated models exist for certain theories and cardinalities:

* ('''Q''', &lt;) – the set of [[rational number]]s with their usual ordering – is saturated.  Intuitively, this is because any type consistent with the [[dense linear order|theory]] is implied by the order type; that is, the order the variables come in tells you everything there is to know about their role in the structure.
* ('''R''', &lt;) – the set of [[real number]]s with their usual ordering – is ''not'' saturated.  For example, take the type (in one variable ''x'') which contains the formula &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{x&gt; -\frac{1}{n}}&lt;/math&gt; for every natural number ''n'', as well as the formula &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{x&lt;0}&lt;/math&gt;.  This type uses ω different parameters from '''R'''.  Every finite subset of the type is realized on '''R''' by some real ''x'', so by compactness it is consistent with the structure, but it is not realized, as it would imply an upper bound to the sequence −1/''n'' which is less than 0 (its least upper bound).  Thus ('''R''',&lt;) is ''not'' ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-saturated, and not saturated.  However, it ''is'' ω-saturated, for essentially the same reason as '''Q''' – every finite type is given by the order type, which if consistent, is always realized, because of the density of the order.
*A dense totally ordered set without endpoints is a [[eta set|η&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; set]] if and only if it is ℵ&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; saturated.
* The [[countable random graph]], with the only non-logical symbol being the edge existence relation, is also saturated, because any complete type is implied by the finite subgraph consisting of the variables and parameters used to define the type.

Both of these theories can be shown to be [[categorical theory|ω-categorical]] through the [[back-and-forth method]].  This can be generalized as follows: the unique model of cardinality κ of a countable κ-categorical theory is saturated.

However, the statement that every model has a saturated [[elementary extension]] is not provable in [[ZFC]].  In fact, this statement is equivalent to {{citation needed|date=July 2018}} the existence of a proper class of cardinals κ such that κ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lt;κ&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;κ.  The latter identity implies that either {{nowrap|κ {{=}} λ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;λ&lt;/sup&gt;}} for some λ, or κ is weakly inaccessible.

==Relationship to prime models==
The notion of saturated model is dual to the notion of [[prime model]] in the following way: let ''T'' be a countable theory in a first-order language (that is, a set of mutually consistent sentences in that language) and let ''P'' be a prime model of ''T''. Then ''P'' admits an [[elementary embedding]] into any other model of ''T''. The equivalent notion for saturated models is that any "reasonably small" model of ''T'' is elementarily embedded in a saturated model, where "reasonably small" means cardinality no larger than that of the model in which it is to be embedded.  Any saturated model is also [[homogeneous model|homogeneous]].  However, while for countable theories there is a unique prime model, saturated models are necessarily specific to a particular cardinality.  Given certain set-theoretic assumptions, saturated models (albeit of very large cardinality) exist for arbitrary theories.  For λ-[[stable theory|stable]] theories, saturated models of cardinality λ exist.

A '''sequence step algorithm''' ('''SQS-AL''') is an [[algorithm]] implemented in a [[discrete event simulation]] system to maximize [[System resource|resource]] utilization. This is achieved by running through two main nested [[Control flow#Loops|loops]]: A sequence step loop and a replication loop. For each sequence step, each replication loop is a simulation run that collects crew [[Idle (CPU)|idle]] time for activities in that sequence step. The collected crew idle times are then used to determine resource arrival dates for user-specified confidence levels. The process of collecting the crew idle times and determining crew arrival times for activities on a considered sequence step is repeated from the first to the last sequence step.

In [[number theory]], '''Skewes's number''' is any of several extremely large numbers used by the [[South Africa]]n mathematician [[Stanley Skewes]] as [[upper bound]]s for the smallest [[natural number]] &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; for which
:&lt;math&gt;\pi(x) &gt; \operatorname{li}(x),&lt;/math&gt;
where π is the [[prime-counting function]] and li is the [[logarithmic integral function]]. These bounds have since been improved by others: there is a crossing near &lt;math&gt;e^{727.95133} &lt; 1.397 \times 10^{316}&lt;/math&gt;. It is not known whether it is the smallest.

==Skewes's numbers==
[[John Edensor Littlewood]], who was Skewes's research supervisor, had proved in {{harvtxt|Littlewood|1914}} that there is such a number (and so, a first such number); and indeed found that the sign of the difference &lt;math&gt;\pi(x) - \operatorname{li}(x)&lt;/math&gt; changes infinitely often. All numerical evidence then available seemed to suggest that &lt;math&gt;\pi(x)&lt;/math&gt; was always less than &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{li}(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Littlewood's proof did not, however, exhibit a concrete such number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

{{harvtxt|Skewes|1933}} proved  that, assuming that the [[Riemann hypothesis]] is true, there exists a number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; violating &lt;math&gt;\pi(x) &lt; \operatorname{li}(x),&lt;/math&gt; below
:&lt;math&gt;e^{e^{e^{79}}}&lt;10^{10^{10^{34}}}&lt;/math&gt;.

In {{harvtxt|Skewes|1955}}, without assuming the Riemann hypothesis, Skewes proved that there must exist a value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; below
:&lt;math&gt;e^{e^{e^{e^{7.705}}}}&lt;10^{10^{10^{964}}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Skewes's task was to make Littlewood's existence proof [[Effective results in number theory|effective]]: exhibiting some concrete upper bound for the first sign change. According to [[Georg Kreisel]], this was at the time not considered obvious even in principle.

==More recent estimates==
These upper bounds have since been reduced considerably by using large scale computer calculations of zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]]. The first estimate for the actual value of a crossover point was given by {{harvtxt|Lehman|1966}}, who showed that somewhere between &lt;math&gt;1.53\times 10^{1165}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1.65\times 10^{1165}&lt;/math&gt; there are more than &lt;math&gt;10^{500}&lt;/math&gt; consecutive integers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\pi(x) &gt; \operatorname{li}(x),&lt;/math&gt;.
Without assuming the Riemann hypothesis, {{harvs|txt=yes|authorlink=Herman te Riele|first=H. J. J.|last= te Riele |year= 1987}} proved an upper bound of &lt;math&gt;7\times 10^{370}&lt;/math&gt;. A better estimate was &lt;math&gt;1.39822\times 10^{316}&lt;/math&gt; discovered by {{harvtxt|Bays|Hudson|2000}}, who showed there are at least &lt;math&gt;10^{153}&lt;/math&gt; consecutive integers somewhere near this value where &lt;math&gt;\pi(x) &gt; \operatorname{li}(x),&lt;/math&gt; and suggested that there are probably at least &lt;math&gt;10^{311}&lt;/math&gt;. Bays and Hudson  found a few much smaller values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\pi(x)&lt;/math&gt; gets close to &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{li}(x)&lt;/math&gt;; the possibility that there are crossover points near these values does not seem to have been definitely ruled out yet, though computer calculations suggest they are unlikely to exist. {{harvtxt|Chao|Plymen|2010}} gave a small improvement and correction to the result of  Bays and Hudson.  {{harvtxt|Saouter|Demichel|2010}} found a smaller interval for a crossing, which was slightly improved by {{harvtxt|Zegowitz|2010}}. The same source shows that there exists a number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; violating &lt;math&gt;\pi(x) &lt; \operatorname{li}(x),&lt;/math&gt; below &lt;math&gt;e^{727.9513468}&lt; 1.39718 \times 10^{316}&lt;/math&gt;. This can be reduced to &lt;math&gt;e^{727.9513386}&lt; 1.39717 \times 10^{316}&lt;/math&gt;, assuming the Riemann hypothesis. {{harvtxt|Stoll|Demichel|2011}} gave &lt;math&gt;1.39716 \times 10^{316}&lt;/math&gt;.

Rigorously, {{harvtxt|Rosser|Schoenfeld|1962}} proved that there are no crossover points below &lt;math&gt;x = 10^8&lt;/math&gt;, improved by {{harvtxt|Brent|1975}} to &lt;math&gt;8\times 10^{10}&lt;/math&gt;, by {{harvtxt|Kotnik|2008}} to &lt;math&gt;10^{14}&lt;/math&gt;, by {{harvtxt|Platt|Trudgian|2014}} to &lt;math&gt;1.39\times 10^{17}&lt;/math&gt;, and by {{harvtxt|Büthe|2015}} to &lt;math&gt;10^{19}&lt;/math&gt;.

There is no explicit value &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; known for certain to have the property &lt;math&gt;\pi(x) &gt; \operatorname{li}(x),&lt;/math&gt; though computer calculations suggest some explicit numbers that are quite likely to satisfy this.

Even though the [[natural density]] of the positive integers for which &lt;math&gt;\pi(x) &gt; \operatorname{li}(x)&lt;/math&gt; does not exist, {{harvtxt|Wintner|1941}} showed that the logarithmic density of these positive integers does exist and is positive. {{harvtxt|Rubinstein|Sarnak|1994}} showed that this proportion is about 0.00000026, which is surprisingly large given how far one has to go to find the first example.

==Riemann's formula==
Riemann gave an [[Explicit formulae (L-function)|explicit formula]] for π(x), whose leading terms are (ignoring some subtle convergence questions)

:&lt;math&gt;\pi(x) = \operatorname{li}(x) - \frac{\operatorname{li}(\sqrt{x})}{2} - \sum_\rho \operatorname{li}(x^\rho) + \text{smaller terms} &lt;/math&gt;
where the sum is over zeros ρ of the Riemann zeta function. The largest error term in the approximation &lt;math&gt;\pi(x) = \operatorname{li}(x)&lt;/math&gt; (if the [[Riemann hypothesis]] is true) is &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{li}(\sqrt{x})/2&lt;/math&gt;, showing that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{li}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is usually larger than &lt;math&gt;\pi(x)&lt;/math&gt;. The other terms above are somewhat smaller, and moreover tend to have different complex arguments so mostly cancel out. Occasionally however, many of the larger ones might happen to have roughly the same complex argument, in which case they will reinforce each other instead of cancelling and will overwhelm the term &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{li}(\sqrt{x})/2&lt;/math&gt;.  

The reason why the Skewes number is so large is that these smaller terms are quite a lot smaller than the leading error term, mainly because the first complex zero of the zeta function has quite a large imaginary part, so a  large number (several hundred) of them need to have roughly the same argument in order to overwhelm the dominant term. The chance of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; random complex numbers having roughly the same argument is about 1 in &lt;math&gt;2^N&lt;/math&gt;. This explains why &lt;math&gt;\pi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes larger than &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{li}(x),&lt;/math&gt; and also why it is  rare for this to happen. It also shows why finding places where this happens depends on large scale calculations of millions of high precision zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The argument above is not a proof, as it assumes the zeros of the Riemann zeta function are random which is not true. Roughly speaking, Littlewood's proof consists of [[Dirichlet's approximation theorem]] to show that sometimes many terms have about the same argument.

In the event that the Riemann hypothesis is false, the argument is much simpler, essentially because  the terms &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{li}(x^{\rho})&lt;/math&gt; for zeros violating the Riemann hypothesis (with real part greater than 1/2) are  eventually larger than &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{li}(x^{1/2})&lt;/math&gt;.

The reason for the term &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{li}(x^{1/2})/2&lt;/math&gt; is that, roughly speaking, &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{li}(x)&lt;/math&gt; counts not primes, but powers of primes &lt;math&gt;p^n&lt;/math&gt; weighted by &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{li}(x^{1/2})/2&lt;/math&gt; is a sort of correction term coming from squares of primes.

Hypothesis, a new upper bound is computed.

[[File:SymmetryOfLifeFormsOnEarth.jpg|thumb|300px|A selection of animals showing a range of possible body  symmetries, including both asymmetry, radial and bilateral [[body plan]]s]]

'''Symmetry in biology''' is the balanced distribution of duplicate body parts or shapes within the body of an organism. In nature and biology, [[symmetry]] is always approximate. For example, plant leaves – while considered symmetrical – rarely match up exactly when folded in half. Symmetry creates a class of  [[patterns in nature]], where the near-repetition of the pattern element is by [[reflection (geometry)|reflection]] or [[rotation (geometry)|rotation]].

The [[body plan]]s of most [[multicellular organism]]s exhibit some form of symmetry, whether radial, bilateral, or spherical. A small minority, notably among the [[sponge]]s, exhibit no symmetry (i.e., are asymmetric). Symmetry was once important in animal [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]; the [[Radiata]], animals with radial symmetry, formed one of the four branches of [[Georges Cuvier]]'s classification of the animal kingdom.

==Radial symmetry==
{{Redirect|Radial symmetry|radial symmetry in mathematics|rotational symmetry}}
[[File:Haeckel Actiniae.jpg|thumb|upright|These sea anemones have been painted to emphasize their radial symmetry. ([[Photographic plate|Plate]] from [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s ''[[Kunstformen der Natur]]'').]]

Radially symmetric organisms resemble a pie where several cutting [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]s produce roughly identical pieces. Such an organism exhibits no left or right sides. They have a top and a bottom surface, or a front and a back.

Symmetry has been important historically in the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of animals; [[Georges Cuvier]] classified animals with radial symmetry in the taxon [[Radiata]] (''Zoophytes''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Waggoner |first1=Ben M. |title=Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/cuvier.html |publisher=UCMP Berkeley |accessdate=8 March 2018 |quote=Cuvier's insistence on the functional integration of organisms led him to classify animals into four "branches," or embranchements: Vertebrata, Articulata (arthropods and segmented worms), Mollusca (which at the time meant all other soft, bilaterally symmetrical invertebrates), and Radiata (cnidarians and echinoderms).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cuvier |first1=Georges |author1link=Georges Cuvier |last2=Griffith |first2=Edward |last3=Pidgeon |first3=Edward |title=The Mollusca and Radiata: Arranged by the Baron Cuvier, with Supplementary Additions to Each Order |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mskQAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA435 |year=1834 |publisher=Whittaker and Company |pages=435–}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now generally accepted to be a [[polyphyly|polyphyletic]] assemblage of different phyla of the [[Animal]] kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hadzi |first=J. |title=The Evolution of the Metazoa |year=1963 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0080100791 |pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most radially symmetric animals are symmetrical about an axis extending from the center of the oral surface, which contains the mouth[[Talk:Ancient Greek medicine|,]] to the center of the opposite, {{linktext|aboral}}, end. Radial symmetry is especially suitable for [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] animals such as the [[sea anemone]], floating animals such as [[jellyfish]], and slow moving organisms such as [[starfish]]. Animals in the phyla [[Cnidaria]] and [[Echinoderm]]ata are radially symmetric,&lt;ref name=IAS/&gt; although many sea anemones and some corals have bilateral symmetry defined by a single structure, the [[siphonoglyph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Finnerty, J.R. | title=The origins of axial patterning in the metazoa: How old is bilateral symmetry? | journal=The International Journal of Developmental Biology | volume=47 | pages=523–9 | year=2003 | id=14756328 16341006 | pmid=14756328 | issue=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LiliumBulbiferumCroceumBologna.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Lilium bulbiferum]]'' displays typical [[floral symmetry]] with repeated parts arranged around the axis of the flower.]]

Many flowers are radially symmetric or [[Floral symmetry|actinomorphic]]. Roughly identical flower parts – [[petal]]s, [[sepal]]s, and [[stamen]]s – occur at regular intervals around the axis of the flower, which is often the female part, with the [[carpel]], [[style (botany)|style]] and [[stigma (botany)|stigma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Endress, P. K. | title=Evolution of Floral Symmetry | journal=Current Opinion in Plant Biology | volume=4 | issue=1 | pages=86–91 | date=February 2001 | url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1369-5266(00)00140-0 | doi=10.1016/S1369-5266(00)00140-0 | pmid=11163173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many viruses have radial symmetries, their coats being composed of a relatively small number of protein molecules arranged in a regular pattern to form polyhedrons, spheres, or ovoids. Most are [[icosahedron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268226190366X | title=Symmetry in virus architecture |author1=Horne, R. W. |author2=Wildy, P. | journal=Virology | date=November 1961 | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=348–373 | doi=10.1016/0042-6822(61)90366-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special forms of radial symmetry===

{{vanchor|Tetramerism}} is a variant of radial symmetry found in [[jellyfish]], which have four canals in an otherwise radial [[body plan]].

[[File:Sterappel dwarsdrsn.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Apple cut horizontally, showing pentamerism]]

{{vanchor|Pentamerism}} (also called pentaradial and pentagonal symmetry) means the organism is in five parts around a central axis, 72° apart. Among animals, only the [[echinodermata|echinoderms]] such as [[sea star]]s, [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea lilies]] are pentamerous as adults, with five arms arranged around the mouth. Being [[bilateria]]n animals, however, they initially develop with mirror symmetry as larvae, then gain pentaradial symmetry later.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, 2001. pp 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flowering plant]]s show fivefold symmetry in many flowers and in various fruits. This is well seen in the arrangement of the five [[carpel]]s (the botanical fruits containing the seeds) in an [[apple]] cut transversely.

{{vanchor|Hexamerism}} is found in the [[coral]]s and [[sea anemones]] (class [[Anthozoa]]) which are divided into two groups based on their symmetry.  The most common corals in the subclass [[Hexacorallia]] have a hexameric body plan; their [[polyp]]s have sixfold internal symmetry and the number of their [[tentacle]]s is a multiple of six.

{{vanchor|Octamerism}} is found in corals of the subclass [[Octocorallia]]. These have polyps with eight tentacles and octameric radial symmetry. The [[octopus]], however, has bilateral symmetry, despite its eight arms.

==Spherical symmetry==
[[File:Mikrofoto.de-volvox-4.jpg|thumb|''[[Volvox]]'' is a microscopic green freshwater [[alga]] with spherical symmetry. Young colonies can be seen inside the larger ones.]]

Spherical symmetry occurs in an organism if it is able to be cut into two identical halves through any cut that runs through the organism's center. Organisms which show approximate spherical symmetry include the freshwater green alga ''[[Volvox]]''.&lt;ref name=IAS&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iaszoology.com/symmetry/ | title=Symmetry | publisher=IAS | accessdate=14 June 2014 | author=Chandra, Girish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bilateral symmetry==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Brain]] --&gt;
{{Redirect|Bilateral symmetry|bilateral symmetry in mathematics|reflection symmetry}}
&lt;!--[[File:Leaf 1 web.jpg|right|thumb|A [[leaf]] showing (imperfect) bilateral symmetry.]]--&gt;
{{main|Bilateria}}

In bilateral symmetry (also called ''plane symmetry''), only one plane, called the [[sagittal plane]], divides an organism into roughly [[mirror image]] halves. Thus there is approximate [[reflection symmetry]]. Internal organs are however not necessarily symmetric.

[[File:20 petit paon de nuit.jpg|thumb|The small emperor moth, ''[[Saturnia pavonia]]'', displays a [[deimatic]] pattern with bilateral symmetry.]]

[[Bilateria|Animals that are bilaterally symmetric]] have mirror symmetry in the sagittal plane, which divides the body vertically into left and right halves, with one of each [[sense organ]] and limb group on either side. At least 99% of animals are bilaterally symmetric, including humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Valentine |first=James W. |title=Bilateria |url=http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=802620&amp;referURL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.accessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d802620 |publisher=AccessScience |accessdate=29 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118213208/http://www.accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=802620&amp;referURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.accessscience.com%2Fcontent.aspx%3Fid%3D802620 |archivedate=18 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NHM&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/evolution/what-is-the-evidence/morphology/bilateralism/ | title=Bilateral symmetry | publisher=Natural History Museum | accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Finnerty&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://faculty.weber.edu/rmeyers/PDFs/Finnerty%20-%20symmetry%20evol.pdf | title=Did internal transport, rather than directed locomotion, favor the evolution of bilateral symmetry in animals? | author=Finnerty, John R. | journal=BioEssays | year=2005 | volume=27 | pages=1174–1180 | doi=10.1002/bies.20299 | pmid=16237677}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[facial symmetry]] influences people's judgements of attractiveness.&lt;ref name="Grammer1994"&gt;Grammer, K.; Thornhill, R.

When an organism normally moves in one direction, it inevitably has a front or head end. This end encounters the environment before the rest of the body as the organism moves along, so sensory organs such as eyes tend to be clustered there, and similarly it is the likely site for a mouth as food is encountered.&lt;ref name=Finnerty/&gt; A distinct head, with sense organs connected to a [[central nervous system]], therefore (on this view) tends to develop ([[cephalization]]). Given a direction of travel which creates a front/back difference, and [[gravity]] which creates a dorsal/ventral difference, left and right are unavoidably distinguished, so a bilaterally symmetric [[body plan]] is widespread and found in most animal phyla.&lt;!--including [[Platyhelminthes]] (flatworms), [[Arthropoda]] (e.g. insects), [[Annelida]] (e.g. earthworms), [[Mollusca]] (e.g. squids, though not in helically coiled snails) and [[Chordata]] (e.g. fish and mammals)--&gt;&lt;ref name=Finnerty/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/arthropods_04 | title=Bilateral (left/right) symmetry | publisher=Berkeley | accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilateral symmetry also permits [[wikt:streamline|streamlining]] to reduce [[drag (physics)|drag]], and on a traditional view in zoology facilitates locomotion.&lt;ref name=Finnerty/&gt; However, in the [[Cnidaria]], different symmetries exist, and bilateral symmetry is not necessarily aligned with the direction of locomotion, so another mechanism such as internal transport may be needed to explain the origin of bilateral symmetry in animals.&lt;ref name=Finnerty/&gt;&lt;ref name=MartindaleHenry/&gt;

[[File:Haeckel Asteridea Larvae.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Starfish larvae|[[Starfish]] [[larvae]] are [[bilaterally symmetric]], whereas the adults have [[#Pentamerism|fivefold symmetry]].]]
The phylum [[Echinodermata]], which includes [[starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s and [[sand dollars]], is unique among animals in having bilateral symmetry at the larval stage, but pentamerism (fivefold symmetry) as adults.&lt;ref name="Lander"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lanwebs.lander.edu/faculty/rsfox/invertebrates/asterias.html | title=''Asterias forbesi'' | author=Fox, Richard | work=Invertebrate Anatomy OnLine | publisher=Lander University | accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bilateral symmetry is not easily broken. In experiments using the fruit fly, ''[[Drosophila]]'', in contrast to other traits (where laboratory [[artificial selection|selection]] experiments always yield a change), right- or left-sidedness in eye size, or [[eye facet]] number, wing-folding behavior (left over right) show a lack of response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/palmer.hp/asym/axes/symmetry.htm Symmetry breaking in fruit flies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Females of some species select for symmetry, presumed by biologists to be a mark (technically a "cue") of fitness. Female [[barn swallow]]s, a species where adults have long tail streamers, prefer to mate with males that have the most symmetrical tails.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Maynard Smith|Maynard Smith, John]]; Harper, David (2003). ''Animal Signals''. Oxford University Press. pp. 63-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ophrys apifera (flower).jpg|thumb|Flower of [[Ophrys apifera|bee orchid]] (''Ophrys apifera'') is bilaterally symmetrical ([[zygomorphic]]). The lip of the flower resembles the (bilaterally symmetric) abdomen of a female bee; pollination occurs when a male bee attempts to mate with it.]]

Flowers in some families of flowering plants, such as the [[Orchidaceae|orchid]] and [[Fabaceae|pea]] families, and also most of the [[Scrophulariaceae|figwort family]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://botany.csdl.tamu.edu/FLORA/301Manhart/Dicots/Asteridae/Scr/Scr.html | title=SCROPHULARIACEAE - Figwort or Snapdragon Family | publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Bioinformatics Working Group | accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; are bilaterally symmetric ([[zygomorphic]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factmonster.com/ce6/sci/A0847482.html Symmetry, biological], from ''[[The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia]]'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biradial symmetry==
Biradial symmetry is a combination of radial and bilateral symmetry, as in the [[ctenophore]]s. Here, the body components are arranged with similar parts on either side of a central axis, and each of the four sides of the body is identical to the opposite side but different from the adjacent side. This may represent a stage in the evolution of bilateral symmetry "from a presumably radially symmetrical ancestor."&lt;ref name=MartindaleHenry&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/4/672.full.pdf | title=The Development of Radial and Biradial Symmetry: The Evolution of Bilaterality1 |author1=Martindale, Mark Q. |author2=Henry, Jonathan Q. | journal=American Zoology | year=1998 | volume=38 | issue=4 | pages=672–684 | doi=10.1093/icb/38.4.672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asymmetry==
{{further|List of animals featuring external asymmetry}}

Not all animals are symmetric. Many members of the [[phylum]] [[Porifera]] ([[sponge]]s) have no symmetry, though some are radially symmetric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Myers, Phil | title=Porifera Sponges | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Porifera/  | publisher=University of Michigan (Animal Diversity Web) | date=2001 | accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is normal for essentially symmetric animals to show some measure of asymmetry. Usually in humans the [[left brain]] is structured differently to the right;&lt;ref name="Zaidel 2001 pp. 1321–1329"&gt;{{cite book | last=Zaidel | first=E. | title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences | chapter=Brain Asymmetry | publisher=Elsevier | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-08-043076-8 | doi=10.1016/b0-08-043076-7/03548-8 | pages=1321–1329}}&lt;/ref&gt; the heart is positioned towards the left;&lt;ref name="Betts2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Betts|first1=J.

K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scale-eating [[cichlid]] ''[[Perissodus microlepis]]'' develops left or right asymmetries in their mouths and jaws that allow them to be more effective when removing scales from the left or right flank of their prey.&lt;ref name=Lee2012&gt;{{cite journal | author=Lee, H. J.; Kusche, H.; Meyer, A. | year=2012 | title=Handed Foraging Behavior in Scale-Eating Cichlid Fish: Its Potential Role in Shaping Morphological Asymmetry | journal=PLoS ONE | volume=7 | issue=9 | page=e44670 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0044670 | pmid=22970282 | pmc=3435272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approximately 400 species of [[flatfish]] also lack symmetry as adults, though the larvae are bilaterally symmetrical. Adult flatfish rest on one side, and the eye that was on that side [[Metamorphosis#Fish|has migrated round]] to the other (top) side of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v454/n7201/full/nature07108.html | title=The evolutionary origin of flatfish asymmetry | author=Friedman, Matt | journal=Nature | date=10 July 2008 | volume=454 | pages=209–212 | doi=10.1038/nature07108 | issue=7201 | pmid=18615083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5568">'''System of systems engineering''' ('''SoSE''') is a set of developing processes, tools, and methods for designing, re-designing and deploying solutions to [[System of systems|system-of-systems]] challenges.

== Overview ==
System of Systems Engineering (SoSE) methodology is heavily used in [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] applications, but is increasingly being applied to non-defense related problems such as architectural design of problems in air and auto transportation, healthcare, global communication networks, search and rescue, space exploration and many other System of Systems application domains.  SoSE is more than [[systems engineering]] of monolithic, [[complexity|complex systems]] because design for System-of-Systems problems is performed under some level of uncertainty in the requirements and the constituent systems, and it involves considerations in multiple levels and domains (as per &lt;ref&gt;Daniel DeLaurentis, "Understanding Transportation as a System-of-Systems Design Problem," 43rd AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Reno, Nevada, January 10–13, 2005. AIAA-2005-0123.&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;Daniel DeLaurentis, Oleg Sindiy, William Stein, "Developing Sustainable Space Exploration via a System-of-Systems Approach," AIAA Space 2006 Conference, San Jose, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;). Whereas systems engineering focuses on building the system right, SoSE focuses on choosing the right system(s) and their interactions to satisfy the requirements.

System-of-Systems Engineering and Systems Engineering are related but different fields of study. Whereas systems engineering addresses the development and operations of monolithic products, SoSE addresses the development and operations of evolving programs. In other words, traditional systems engineering seeks to optimize an individual system (i.e., the product), while SoSE seeks to optimize network of various interacting legacy and new systems brought together to satisfy multiple objectives of the program.  SoSE should enable the decision-makers to understand the implications of various choices on technical performance, costs, extensibility and flexibility over time; thus, effective SoSE methodology should prepare decision-makers to design informed architectural solutions for [[System of systems|System-of-Systems]] problems.

Due to varied methodology and domains of applications in existing literature, there does not exist a single unified consensus for processes involved in System-of-Systems Engineering.  One of the proposed SoSE frameworks, by Dr. Daniel A. DeLaurentis, recommends a three-phase method where a SoS problem is defined (understood), abstracted, modeled and analyzed for behavioral patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel DeLaurentis, Oleg Sindiy, William Stein, "Developing Sustainable Space Exploration via a System-of-Systems Approach," AIAA Space 2006 Conference, San Jose, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;  More information on this method and other proposed methods can be found in the listed SoSE focused organizations and SoSE literature in the subsequent sections.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1226">In [[computability theory]] and [[mathematical logic]] the '''Tarski–Kuratowski algorithm''' is a [[non-deterministic algorithm]] which provides an [[upper bound]] for the complexity of formulas in the [[arithmetical hierarchy]] and [[analytical hierarchy]].

The algorithm is named after [[Alfred Tarski]] and [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]].

==Algorithm==
The Tarski–Kuratowski algorithm for the arithmetical hierarchy consists of the following steps:
# Convert the formula to [[prenex normal form]].
# If the formula is quantifier-free, it is in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_0&lt;/math&gt;.
# Otherwise, count the number of alternations of quantifiers; call this ''k''.
# If the first quantifier is [[Existential quantification|∃]], the formula is in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^0_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;.
# If the first quantifier is [[Universal quantification|∀]], the formula is in &lt;math&gt;\Pi^0_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4022">In [[representation theory]], a branch of mathematics, the '''theorem of the highest weight''' states that the [[irreducible representation]]s of [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s or [[compact Lie group]]s are classified by their [[highest weight]]s: given a simply-connected compact Lie group ''G'' with Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, there is a bijection&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dixmier|loc=Theorem 7.2.6.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda \mapsto [V^\lambda]&lt;/math&gt;
from the set of integral points on the positive Weyl chamber, called [[dominant weight]]s, to the set of equivalence classes of irreducible representations of the complexification of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; (or ''G''); &lt;math&gt;V^{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is an irreducible representation with highest weight &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

== Statement ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; be a finite-dimensional semisimple complex Lie algebra with [[Cartan subalgebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;. Let
*&lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; = the &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;-[[weight lattice]],
*&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_{\mathbb{R}}&lt;/math&gt; = the real vector space spanned by &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;\Phi^+&lt;/math&gt; = set of positive roots, &lt;math&gt;\Phi^-&lt;/math&gt; = the set of negative roots,
*&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{g}_- \oplus \mathfrak{h} \oplus \mathfrak{g}_+&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_-&lt;/math&gt; is spanned by the &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;-weight vectors of negative weights and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_+&lt;/math&gt; those of positive weights,
*&lt;math&gt;C = \{ x \in \Lambda_{\mathbb{R}} \mid \langle x, \alpha \rangle \ge 0, \, \alpha \in \Phi^+ \}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[positive Weyl chamber]].
Then the theorem states:
*If ''V'' is a finite-dimensional irreducible representation of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, then the space of vectors ''v'' in ''V'' such that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_+ v = 0&lt;/math&gt; has dimension 1; a non-zero vector that spans this one-dimensional space is called a [[highest weight vector]] of ''V'' and the weight of such a vector is called the highest weight of ''V''.
*For a highest weight vector ''v'' of ''V'', ''V'' is spanned by vectors obtained by applying elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_-&lt;/math&gt; to ''v''.
*Every highest weight is [[dominant weight|dominant]] in the sense that it lies in ''C''.
*If two finite-dimensional irreducible representations have the same highest weight, they are equivalent.
*Given a dominant weight (i.e., an integral or lattice point of ''C''), there exists a finite-dimensional irreducible representation whose highest weight is the given dominant weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dixmier|loc=Proposition 7.2.2. (i)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most difficult part is the last one; the construction of a finite-dimensional irreducible representation.

== Proofs ==
There are at least three proofs:
*The theory of [[Verma module]]s contains the highest weight theorem. This is the approach taken in the standard textbooks (e.g., Humphreys and Dixmier).
*The [[Borel–Weil–Bott theorem]] constructs an irreducible representation as the space of global sections of an ample line bundle; the highest weight theorem results as a consequence. (The approach uses a fair bit of algebraic geometry but yields a very quick proof.)
*The [[invariant theory|invariant theoretic]] approach: one constructs irreducible representations as subrepresentations of a tensor power of the standard representions. This approach is essentially due to H. Weyl and works quite well for classical groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10237">A '''variance swap''' is an [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] [[financial derivative]] that allows one to [[Speculation|speculate]] on or [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] [[risk]]s associated with the magnitude of movement, i.e. [[volatility (finance)|volatility]], of some [[underlying]] product, like an [[exchange rate]], [[interest rate]], or [[stock index]].

One leg of the swap will pay an amount based upon the realized [[variance]] of the price changes of the underlying product.  Conventionally, these price changes will be daily [[logarithm|log]] [[return (finance)|returns]], based upon the most commonly used closing price.  The other leg of the swap will pay a fixed amount, which is the [[strike (finance)|strike]], quoted at the deal's inception.  Thus the net payoff to the [[counterparty|counterparties]] will be the difference between these two and will be settled in [[cash]] at the expiration of the deal, though some cash payments will likely be made along the way by one or the other counterparty to maintain agreed upon [[margin (finance)|margin]].

==Structure and features==
The features of a variance swap include:
* the '''variance strike'''
* the '''realized variance'''
* the '''vega notional''': Like other [[swap (finance)|swap]]s, the payoff is determined based on a [[notional amount]] that is never exchanged. However, in the case of a variance swap, the notional amount is specified in terms of [[Greeks (finance)#Vega|vega]], to convert the payoff into dollar terms.

The payoff of a variance swap is given as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;N_{\text{var}}(\sigma_{\text{realised}}^2-\sigma_{\text{strike}}^2)&lt;/math&gt;

where:
*&lt;math&gt;N_{\text{var}}&lt;/math&gt; = variance notional (a.k.a. variance units),
*&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\text{realised}}^2&lt;/math&gt; = annualised realised variance, and
*&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\text{strike}}^2&lt;/math&gt; = variance strike.&lt;ref name="FINCAD"&gt;{{cite web

The annualised realised variance is calculated based on a prespecified set of sampling points over the period. It does not always coincide with the classic statistical definition of variance as the contract terms may not subtract the mean. For example, suppose that there are n+1 sample points 
&lt;math&gt;S_{\text{0}},S_{\text{1}}, ..., S_{\text{n}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Define, for i=1 to n, &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{i}} = \ln(S_{\text{i}}/S_{\text{i-1}}),&lt;/math&gt; the natural log returns.
Then 
*&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{\text{realised}}^2 =  \frac{A}{n} \sum_{\text{i=1}}^{\text{n}}  R_{\text{i}}^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an annualisation factor normally chosen to be approximately the number of sampling points in a year (commonly 252). It can be seen that subtracting the mean return will decrease the realised variance. If this is done, it is common to use &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; as the divisor rather than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to an unbiased [[estimator|estimate]] of the sample variance.

It is market practice to determine the number of contract units as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;N_{\text{var}}=\frac{N_{\text{vol}}}{2\sigma_{\text{strike}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_{\text{vol}}&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding vega notional for a [[volatility swap]].&lt;ref name="FINCAD"/&gt; This makes the payoff of a variance swap comparable to that of a [[volatility swap]], another less popular instrument used to trade volatility.

==Pricing and valuation==
The variance swap may be hedged and hence priced using a portfolio of European [[call option|call]] and [[put option|put]] options with weights inversely proportional to the square of strike.&lt;ref name="DDKZ99"&gt;{{cite web

Any [[volatility smile]] model which prices [[vanilla option]]s can therefore be used to price the variance swap. For example, using the [[Heston model]], a closed-form solution can be derived for the fair variance swap rate. Care must be taken with the behaviour of the smile model in the wings as this can have a disproportionate effect on the price.

We can derive the payoff of a variance swap using [[Ito's Lemma]]. We first assume that the underlying stock is described as follows:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS_{t}}{S_{t}}\ = \mu dt + \sigma dZ_{t} &lt;/math&gt;

Applying Ito's formula, we get:

&lt;math&gt; d(\log S_{t}) = \left ( \mu - \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\ \right)dt + \sigma dZ_{t} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac{dS_{t}}{S_{t}}\ - d(\log S_{t}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\ dt &lt;/math&gt;

Taking integrals, the total variance is:

&lt;math&gt; \text{Variance} = \frac{1}{T}\ \int\limits_{0}^{T}\sigma^2 dt\ = \frac{2}{T}\ \left ( \int\limits_{0}^{T} \frac{dS_{t}}{S_{t}}\ \ - \ln \left ( \frac{S_{T}}{S_{0}}\ \right ) \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

We can see that the total variance consists of a rebalanced hedge of &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{S_{t}}\ &lt;/math&gt; and short a log contract. &lt;br&gt;Using a [[static replication]] argument

, i.e., any twice continuously differentiable contract can be replicated using a bond, a future and infinitely many puts and calls, we can show that a short log contract position is equal to being short a futures contract and a collection of puts and calls:

&lt;math&gt; -\ln \left ( \frac{S_{T}}{S^{*}}\ \right ) = -\frac{S_{T}-S^{*}}{S^{*}}\ + \int\limits_{K \le S^{*} } (K-S_T)^{+} \frac{dK}{K^2}\ + \int\limits_{K \ge S^{*} } (S_T-K)^{+} \frac{dK}{K^2}\ &lt;/math&gt;

Taking expectations and setting the value of the variance swap equal to zero, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the fair variance swap strike:

&lt;math&gt; K_{var} = \frac{2}{T}\ \left ( rT- \left (\frac{S_{0}}{S^{*}}\ e^{rT} -1 \right ) - \ln\left ( \frac{S^{*}}{S_{0}}\ \right )  +e^{rT}  \int\limits_{0}^{S^{*}} \frac{1}{K^2}\ P(K)dK + e^{rT}  \int\limits_{S^{*}}^{\infin} \frac{1}{K^2}\ C(K)dK  \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Where: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; S_{0} &lt;/math&gt; is the initial price of the underlying security,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; S^{*}&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary cutoff,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; K &lt;/math&gt; is the strike of the each option in the collection of options used.

Often the cutoff &lt;math&gt;S^{*}&lt;/math&gt;is chosen to be the current forward price &lt;math&gt; S^{*} = F_0 = S_0e^{rT} &lt;/math&gt;, in which case the fair variance swap strike can be written in the simpler form:

&lt;math&gt; K_{var} = \frac{2e^{rT}}{T}\ \left (  \int\limits_{0}^{F_{0}} \frac{1}{K^2}\ P(K)dK +   \int\limits_{F_{0}}^{\infin} \frac{1}{K^2}\ C(K)dK  \right )&lt;/math&gt;

==Uses==
Many traders find variance swaps interesting or useful for their purity.  An alternative way of speculating on volatility is with an [[option (finance)|option]], but if one only has interest in volatility risk, this strategy will require constant [[delta hedging]], so that direction risk of the underlying security is approximately removed.  What is more, a [[replicating portfolio]] of a variance swap would require an entire strip of options, which would be very costly to execute.  Finally, one might often find the need to be regularly rolling this entire strip of options so that it remains centered on the current price of the underlying 
[[security (finance)|security]].

The advantage of variance swaps is that they provide pure exposure to the volatility of the underlying price, as opposed to call and put options which may carry directional risk (delta). The profit and loss from a variance swap depends directly on the difference between realized and [[implied volatility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Another aspect that some speculators may find interesting is that the quoted strike is determined by the implied [[volatility smile]] in the options market, whereas the ultimate payout will be based upon actual realized variance.  Historically, implied variance has been above realized variance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3452">[[Image:Box fractal.svg|thumb|245px|right|Vicsek fractal (5th iteration of cross form)]]
In [[mathematics]] the '''Vicsek fractal''', also known as '''Vicsek snowflake''' or '''box fractal''',&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=BoxFractal|title=Box Fractal}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[fractal]] arising from a construction similar to that of the [[Sierpinski carpet]], proposed by [[Tamás Vicsek]]. It has applications including as compact [[fractal antenna|antennas]], particularly in cellular phones.

==Construction==
The basic square is decomposed into nine smaller squares in the 3-by-3 grid. The four squares at the corners and the middle square are left, the other squares being removed. The process is repeated recursively for each of the five remaining subsquares. The Vicsek fractal is the set obtained at the limit of this procedure. The [[Hausdorff dimension]] of this fractal is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac {\log(5)} {\log(3)}}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 1.46497.

An alternative construction (shown below in the left image) is to remove the four corner squares and leave the middle square and the squares above, below, left and right of it. The two constructions produce identical limiting curves, but one is rotated by 45 degrees with respect to the other.
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[File:Box or Vicsek Fractal 4-iterations.svg|550px|thumb|center|Four iterations of the saltire form of the fractal (top) and the cross form of the fractal (bottom).]]

==Properties==
The Vicsek fractal has the surprising property that it has zero area yet an infinite [[perimeter]], due to its non-integer dimension. At each iteration, four squares are removed for every five retained, meaning that at iteration ''n'' the area is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{(\frac{5}{9})^n}&lt;/math&gt; (assuming an initial square of side length 1). When ''n'' approached infinity, the area approaches zero. The perimeter however is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{4(\frac{5}{3})^n}&lt;/math&gt;, because each side is divided into three parts and the center one is replaced with three sides, yielding an increase of three to five. The perimeter approaches infinity as ''n'' increases.

The boundary of the Vicsek fractal is the [[Koch snowflake#Variants of the Koch curve|Type 1 quadratic Koch curve]].

==Analogues in higher dimensions==
[[Image:3D Vicsek Fractal.gif|thumb|right|200px|Animation of the 3D analogue of the Vicsek fractal (third iteration)]]
There is a three-dimensional analogue of the Vicsek fractal. It is constructed by subdividing each cube into 27 smaller ones, and removing all but the "center cross", the central cube and the six cubes touching the center of each face. Its Hausdorff dimension is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{\log(7)}{\log(3)}}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 1.7712.

Similarly to the two-dimensional Vicsek fractal, this figure has zero volume. Each iteration removes retains 7 cubes for every 27, meaning a volume of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{(\frac{7}{27})^n}&lt;/math&gt; at iteration ''n'', which approaches zero as ''n'' approaches infinity.

There exist an infinite number of [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]]s which yield the two-dimensional Vicsek fractal.
