The '''Agasha Temple of Wisdom''' is a [[spiritualism|spiritualist]] group founded in 1943 by [[Richard Zenor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=James|title=The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions|date=1998|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=1573922226|page=32|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=oVQUAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of [[James Crenshaw]]'s book ''Telephone Between Two Worlds'' in 1950, in which both Zenor and the temple were prominently featured, the temple became more popular. Upon Zenor's death in 1978, Geary Salvat was chosen to lead the group.

Geary Salvat is a follower of both Richard Zenor and of Ayuibbi Tobabu, and he has written a journal of quotes, ''Getting Into Gear''. He died in 2002.

The group focuses on communicating with the dead through [[mediumship|mediums]], placing particular attention on receiving and studying the teachings of "master teachers" such as Zenor's "Agasha".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malony|first1=H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13085">The '''Akhand Kirtani Jatha''' (or AKJ) is a sect or ''jatha'' (collective group) of [[Sikhism]] dedicated to the Sikh lifestyle.

The AKJ has been called a purist or fundamentalist group within [[Sikhism]],&lt;ref name="Bhogalarticle"/&gt; because it believes that the words of the Guru Granth are literally the words of the Guru, asserting that no interpretation of scriptural passages by others is necessary, whose meaning is clear and self-evident.&lt;ref name="Bhogalarticle"/&gt; The sect extends the [[Sikh Rehat Maryada]] (Sikh Code of Conduct) of the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]], and includes its own code called the ''Rahit-bibek''.&lt;ref name="Bhogalarticle"/&gt; The group, for example, extends the uncut hair (''kesh'') requirement for men, with a small turban (''keshki'') to be worn by both women and men.&lt;ref name="Bhogalarticle"/&gt;&lt;ref name=akjencyclobrit/&gt;

==History==
The roots of this sect are in the movement initiated by [[Randhir Singh (Sikh)|Randhir Singh]] (d. 1961) during the [[Indian independence movement]] in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Bhogalarticle"&gt;Balbinder Bhogal [http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sikhism/akha.html Akhand Kirtani Jatha] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050906210450/http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sikhism/akha.html |date=6 September 2005 }} in: E.

===Randhir Singh===
[[File:Bhai randhir singh.jpg|thumb|Randhir Singh]]
[[Randhir Singh (Sikh)|Randhir Singh]] (1878–1961) from Ludhiana who opposed the British rule and was imprisoned by the British authorities in 1914 till 1931. His followers were known as the ''Bhai Randhir Singh da Jatha''. 

===AKJ===
The Akhand Kirtani Jatha was a group that grew in the later half of twentieth century. Since the 1978, it was headed by Amarjit Kaur, whose husband was killed in the [[1978 Sikh–Nirankari clashes]] in Amritsar in 1978.&lt;ref name="Grewal1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. S.

The AKJ appears as a group of the [[Sikh diaspora]] involved in the [[Khalistan movement]] in the 1980s. The AKJ participated in a convention in [[Slough, Berkshire]] in 1987.&lt;ref name="Goulbourne1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harry Goulbourne|title=Ethnicity and Nationalism in Post-imperial Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JNDS4iJ6CkC&amp;pg=PA160|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-40084-8|pages=160–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No estimates on the number of adherents is known. Outside of [[Amritsar]] and Ludhiana Panjab, the AKJ appear to have a United Kingdom chapters in [[Coventry]],&lt;ref name="Bhogalarticle"/&gt; [[Birmingham]] and [[Derby]] UK.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

==Beliefs==
Akhand Kirtani Jatha believe that "'all praise must be to the Guru Granth Sahib and God and there is absolutely no need for any respect for a living sant' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nesbitt|first=Eleanor|title=The Intimate Other: Love Divine in Indic Religious (Hardcover)|editor1=Anna King |editor2=John Brockington |publisher=Orient Longman |date=25 Jul 2005|pages=328|chapter=Ten - Young British Sikhs and Religious Devotion|isbn=978-81-250-2801-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0FvH1aCXETwC&amp;pg=PA328&amp;dq=akhand+kirtani+jatha&amp;cd=17#v=onepage&amp;q=akhand%20kirtani%20jatha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2018}}

AKJ differs in many parts from mainstream Sikhism in their interpretation of one of [[The Five Ks]] of Sikhism: instead of accepting the ''[[Kesh (Sikhism)|kes]]'' or "uncut hair", they interpret the command as referring to ''keski'', a small turban, which they maintain must be worn by Sikhs of either sex.

In Bhogal's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/contribs.html |title=Contributors to the Overview of World Religions |publisher=Philtar.ucsm.ac.uk |accessdate=2009-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228045157/http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/contribs.html |archive-date=28 December 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; description of beliefs and practices of the AKJ, he noted some of the group's beliefs and said "In such beliefs the group reject the general code of conduct known as the [[Sikh Rahit Marayada]] of the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee|S.G.P.C.]] [...], and produced their own called ''rahit-bibek'' (''bibek'' means discrimination, discernment, insight)."&lt;ref name="Bhogalarticle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haynes 316"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haynes|first=Jeffrey |title=Routledge handbook of religion and politics|publisher=Routledge;|date= 30 Jun 2008|edition=1|pages=316|chapter=19|isbn=0-415-41455-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ULWtjZxscpIC&amp;pg=PT328&amp;dq=Sikh+rehat+maryada&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Sikh%20rehat%20maryada&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liturgy===
Bhogal also noted that "They also believe in a "different Khalsa initiation ceremony" (as of the original which was set up in 1699 by the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh himself), wherein the five beloved ones, or five Gursikhs place their right hand on the neophyte's head and meditatively repeat the mantra '[[Waheguru|Vahiguru]]', revolving around the innitiate for five or so minutes."&lt;ref name="Bhogalarticle"/&gt;

The Jatha's devotional singing programmes include all-night ''Rain sabai'' and ''Kirtan Darbars'' which usually last around 11 hours.
The ''kirtan'' is usually sung with basic musical tunes as the main emphasis of the ''kirtans'' is on the Guru's Word and repeating the ''Gurmantar'' (Guru's Mantra) of ''vaheguru'' with great fervour when prompted to repeat the Lord's Name in the sacred hymns being sung.
Jatha members never eat meat, fish or eggs, and the AKJ argues strongly that eating any form of flesh is forbidden in the AKJ ''rahit-bibek''.&lt;ref name="Bhogalarticle"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tapoban&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tapoban.org/index.html?gurmat.html |title=Tapoban.org |publisher=Tapoban.org |accessdate=2009-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531002930/http://www.tapoban.org/index.html?gurmat.html |archivedate=31 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pathkhalsa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panthkhalsa.org/rahit/rahit_kuthha.php|title=Kuthha and Sikhism|publisher=Fort:Panth Khalsa|accessdate=2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Raagmala'' is a composition appended to Sri Guru Granth Sahib, appearing after the ''"Mundaavni"'' (epilogue or "closing seal").
The Jatha do not accept the ''Raagmala''  and do not read it when concluding a scripture-reading - the vast majority of baptized Sikhs read since 1604 the Raagmala.&lt;ref name="Bhogalarticle"/&gt;

Bhogal noted that this is one of the areas in which the AKJ rejects the "[[Sikh Rehat Maryada]] of the [[SGPC]]"&lt;ref name="Bhogalarticle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haynes 316"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Nirmal |title=Searches In Sikhism: thought, understanding, observance|publisher=Hemkunt Publishers|location=New Dehli |year=2008|pages=184 onwards|chapter=10|isbn=978-81-7010-367-7|oclc= 320246878|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yMJypUEQkEQC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=Sikh+rehat+maryada&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Sikh%20rehat%20maryada&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kapoor|first= Sukhbir Singh |author2=Mohinder Kaur Kapoor|title=The Making of the Sikh Rehatnamas|publisher=Hemkunt Publishers|location=New Delhi, India|year=2008|pages=9|chapter=Introduction|isbn=978-81-7010-370-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6A_IX9WxnhoC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Sikh+rehat+maryada&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Sikh%20rehat%20maryada&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; interpretation.&lt;ref name="Bhogalarticle"/&gt;

===Vegetarianism===
{{further|Diet in Sikhism}}
The AKJ have their own interpretation of the Sikh prohibition against  "[[Kutha meat]]". They hold that this term  means "slaughtered animal" or "killed animal", and thus that eating any meat whatsoever is a transgression.&lt;ref name=tapoban /&gt;&lt;ref name=pathkhalsa /&gt;

''[[Kutha meat|Kuttha]]: meat of animal or fowl slaughtered slowly as prescribed by Islamic law.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sikhism, A Complete Introduction, Dr. H.S.Singha &amp; Satwant Kaur, Hemkunt Press  - We must give the rationale behind prescribing jhatka meat as the approved food for the Sikhs. According to the ancient Aryan Hindu tradition, only such meat as is obtained from an animal which is killed with one stroke of the weapon causing instantaneous death is fit for human consumption. However, with the coming of Islam into India and the Muslim political hegemony, it became a state policy not to permit slaughter of animals for food, in any other manner, except as laid down in the Quran - the kosher meat prepared by slowly severing the main blood artery of the throat of the animal while reciting verses from the Quran. It is done to make slaughter a sacrifice to God and to expiate the sins of the slaughter. Guru Gobind Singh took a rather serious view of this aspect of the whole matter. He, therefore, while permitting flesh to be taken as food repudiated the whole theory of this expiatory sacrifice and the right of ruling Muslims to impose it on the non-Muslims. Accordingly, he made jhatka meat obligatory for those Sikhs who may be interested in taking meat as a part of their food.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sikhs and Sikhism, Dr. I.J.Singh, Manohar Publishers. - And one semitic practice clearly rejected in the Sikh code of conduct is eating flesh of an animal cooked in ritualistic manner; this would mean kosher and halal meat. The reason again does not lie in religious tenet but in the view that killing an animal with a prayer is not going to enoble the flesh. No ritual, whoever conducts it, is going to do any good either to the animal or to the diner. Let man do what he must to assuage his hunger. If what he gets, he puts to good use and shares with the needy, then it is well used and well spent, otherwise not.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allamah''' ({{lang-ar|علامه}}, [[Urdu]] and {{Lang-fa|{{nq|علامه}}}}), also spelled ''Allamah'' and ''Allama'', is an honorary title carried by scholars of Islamic [[fiqh]] (jurisprudence) and philosophy.

It is used as an honorific in [[Sunni Islam]] as well as in [[Shia Islam]], mostly in [[South Asia]], [[Middle East]] and [[Iran]]. Sunnis and Shias who have achieved the rank of a scholarship in several disciplines are often referred to by the title.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15716">'''Attachment theory and psychology of religion''' research explores the ways that a belief in [[God]] can fulfill the criteria of an attachment figure and examines how individual differences in attachment lead to correspondence or compensation pathways.

==Introduction to attachment theory==
[[Attachment theory]] began with evolutionary psychologist [[John Bowlby]] in 1969.  Attachment theory was initially grounded in the observation that human beings appear to be born with an innate psychobiological system (the "attachment behavioral system") that motivates them to seek proximity to significant others (''attachment figures'').&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"&gt;Granqvist, P., Mikulincer, M. &amp; Shaver, P. R. (2010). Religion as attachment: Normative processes and individual differences. ''Personality and Social Psychology Review'', 14. doi: 10.1177/1088868309348618&lt;/ref&gt;  This revolutionary theory has found application in topics such as friendships, romantic relationships, coping with stress, loneliness and grief.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"&gt;Kirkpatrick, L. A., (2005). Attachment, evolution, and the psychology of religion. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowlby described an attachment system as an evolved behavioral system in humans and other primates, which was designed by natural selection to maintain proximity between people and their attachment figures.  He postulated that the attachment system is in line with control systems theory, a goal-corrected, or homeostatic system.  The system monitors proximity to the primary caregiver, friends,&lt;ref&gt;ATTACHMENT AS A PREDICTOR OF FRIENDSHIP OUALITIES IN COLLEGE YOUTH by JOCELYN A. SAFERSTEIN, ''SOCIAL BEHAVIOR AND PERSONALITY'', 2005, 33(8), 767-776&lt;/ref&gt; pets,&lt;ref&gt;Pets as safe havens and secure bases: The moderating role of pet attachment orientations, Sigal Zilcha-Manoor, ''Journal of Research in Personality'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt; romantic partners and compares it to the desired level of proximity.  If the attachment figure is regarded as unavailable or not near enough, attachment behaviors are activated and deactivated when attachment figure becomes sufficient.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

On the “flip side” of attachment is the exploration system.  When the exploration system is activated, the attachment system is deactivated.  While the attachment system keeps the primary caregiver, adult romantic partner, pets or friends in close proximity, the exploration system allows for acquiring and practicing new skills while exploring the environment.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;  These two functions are crucial in defining and distinguishing attachment relationships from other types of [[interpersonal relationships]].  Insecurely attached individuals either defensively minimize closeness seeking behaviors or maximize behaviors to become closer to attachment figure.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;  These two behaviors can be conceptualized as avoidant attachment (the extent to which a person distrusts attachment figure and strives to maintain behavioral independence and emotional distance) and anxious attachment (the degree to which a person worries that an attachment figure will not be available partly because the anxiously attached person doubts his or her own lovability and value).&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;

==God as an attachment figure==
[[Psychoanalysis]] has a long history of conceptualizing religious belief in terms of relationship between the self and others.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"/&gt;  A religious believer's perception that they have a relationship with a deity or God leaves open the question of whether such a relationship is an attachment relation. It is easy to draw analogies between beliefs about God and mental models of attachment figures, but it is a difficult distinction to make that God "really" can be an attachment figure.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"/&gt;   In addition, research has shown that adult attachments and attachment to God are fundamentally distinct phenomenon, for instance Simon and Low (2003).&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Psychology and Theology'', 2010: Adult Attachment, God, Attachment and Gender in Relation to Perceived Stress by Sarah R. Reiner&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkpatrick suggests that for many people in many religions, the attachment system is fundamentally involved in their thinking, beliefs, and reasoning about God and their relationship to God.  According to this theory our knowledge of how attachment processes work in non-religious relationships should prove useful in understanding the ways in which people see God and interact with God.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

===Seeking and maintaining proximity to God===

One biological function of the attachment system, according to Bowlby,&lt;ref name="Bowlby"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1969/1982). ''Attachment and Loss'': Vol. 1. ''Attachment''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; is to maintain proximity between a person and an attachment figure.  Religions provide many ways that believers can maintain closeness to God.  Most theistic traditions describe God as being omnipresent, that is, is all places at all times, and while this is a key aspect of religion that creates closeness to God it is not the only way.  Virtually all religions have a place or building in which believers come to worship and be closer to their deity or God.  Within these places of worship, as well as outside of them, there is an array of idols and symbols; such as artwork, jewelry, and images of crosses that serve to remind believers of God’s closeness.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"&gt;Granqvist, P. &amp; Kirkpatrick, L. A. (2008). Attachment and religious representations and behavior. In J. Cassidy, P. R. Shaver, J. Cassidy, P. R. Shaver (eds.), ''Handbook of attachment: Theory, research, and clinical applications'' (2nd ed.) (pp. 906–933). New York, NY US: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Granqvist and Kirkpatrick suggest that [[prayer]] is the most important way that believers maintain proximity to God.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

===God as haven of safety===

Another function of the attachment system, according to Bowlby,&lt;ref name="Bowlby"/&gt; is the attachment figure serving as a haven of safety in times of danger or threat. Bowlby&lt;ref name="Bowlby"/&gt; also described three situations that activate the attachment behaviors: (1) frightening or alarming environmental events; (2)illness, injury or fatigue; and (3) separation or threat of separation from attachment figure.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

===God as secure base===

A “secure base” provides security for exploration in one’s environment.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt; By most definitions God is omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient.  Bowlby&lt;ref name="Bowlby"/&gt; described a secure base and its psychological effects as  this, “When an individual is confident that an attachment figure will be available to him whenever he desires it, that person will be much less prone to either intense or chronic fear than will an individual who for any reason has no such confidence.”  It is easy to see how God would be the most secure of secure bases.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

In religious scripture God is often described as by one’s side, one’s rock and fortress, one’s strength, and many other terms that reflect an [[attachment theory|attachment relationship]].  Research done by Myers (1992), as mentioned by Granqvist and Kirkpatrick,&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt; on the psychological outcomes associated with “attachment to God” (such as religious faith giving believers a sense of optimism and hope for the future) suggest that at least some forms of religiousness are associated with the kind of confident, self-assured approach to life that a secure base is thought to provide.

===Responses to separation and loss===

Ainsworth (1985), as mentioned by Granqvist and Kirkpatrick,&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt; outlines the fourth and fifth defining criteria of attachment as concern responses to separation from, or loss of, the attachment figure per se: The threat of separation causes anxiety in the attached person, and loss of the attachment figure causes grief.  Because of God’s perceived omnipresence, it is difficult to determine whether God meets these criteria.  A believer does not lose a relationship with God as he or she loses a human relationship.  There are instances in religious life when believers are unable to experience God as they did at some point in their life.  It is important to note that in most Christian belief systems, separation from God is the very essence of hell.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

===Perceiving God as stronger and wiser===

Bowlby&lt;ref name="Bowlby"/&gt; further described an “attachment relationship” as a weaker, less competent individual having another individual that he or she perceives as stronger and wiser, but this is now known to be wrong, as research has identified that  adult attachments include friendships, romantic relationships and even pets&lt;ref&gt;Pets as safe havens and secure bases: The moderating role of pet attachment orientations by Sigal Zilcha-Mano, ''Journal of Research into Personality'', 2012&lt;/ref&gt; in which the reciprocal partner, be it human or non-human, is not necessarily perceived as stronger or wiser.

==Individual differences==

Individual differences in attachment security often affect the output of the attachment system in human relationships.  In the same way, they often modify the effects of attachment processes in the context of believers’ perceived relationships with God.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;  Two general hypotheses have been suggested and are seen as describing two distinct developmental pathways in religion—the compensation hypothesis and the correspondence hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Granqvist &amp; Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

===Compensation pathway===

The compensation pathway is related to the regulation of distress following experiences with insensitive caregivers.  This situation describes a negative answer to the question of whether an attachment figure is sufficiently near, attentive, responsive, and approving.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;  According to the [[attachment theory]] this situation activates attachment behaviors to restore an adequate degree of proximity, but under certain condition the individual may anticipate that their efforts are unlikely to be successful. Bowlby described what is likely to happen if such a case occurs, “Whenever the natural object of attachment behavior is unavailable, the behavior can become directed towards some substitute object.  Even though it is inanimate, such an object frequently appears capable of filling the role of an important, though subsidiary, attachment ‘figure.’  Like the principal attachment figure, the inanimate substitute is sought especially when a child is tired, ill or distressed”.&lt;ref name="Bowlby"/&gt;{{rp|313}}

Granqvist and others&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt; suggest that people should also be able to turn to God as a substitute attachment-like figure under such conditions.  The compensation pathway’s focus is on the degree to which experiences with insensitive caregivers and/or attachment insecurities are associated with use of God and religion to regulate attachment-related distress.

Studies on attachment and religion have been ambiguous with no clear findings. 
According to Hall, Fukujima and Delaney after an independent review of literature: "On the surface, it appears that the empirical literature to date presents a rather inconsistent picture."&lt;ref name="TODD W. HALL 2010"&gt;TODD W. HALL, Attachment to God and Implicit Spirituality, Clarifying Correspondence and Compensation Models, ''Journal of Psychology and Theology'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The same authors in 2010 found that the compensation model was not supported, and insecure individuals high in parental insensitivity were not more religious.&lt;ref name="TODD W. HALL 2010"/&gt;

Hagekull and Granqvist in 2001 found that childhood insecure attachment to a mother were strongly related to holding positive beliefs about astrology, the occult, parapsychology and UFOs in a Swedish sample.&lt;ref&gt;Personality and cognitive predictors of New Age practices and beliefs by Miguel Farias, Gordon Claridge and Mansur Lalljee, ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Since these New Age beliefs, such as parapsychology or astrology are unrelated to a personal God, these results argue against the model that insecure individuals adopt concepts involving a personal loving God to compensate for inadequate childhood relationships.
 
Granqvist and Kirkpatrick&lt;ref name=G&gt;Granqvist, P. &amp; Kirkpatrick, L. A. (2004). Religious conversion and perceived childhood attachment: A meta-analysis. ''International Journal For The Psychology Of Religion'', 14(4), 223-250. doi:10.1207/s15327582ijpr1404_1&lt;/ref&gt; found that people who had sudden conversions to religion not only outscored non-converts in parental insensitivity but also outscored individuals who had experienced a more gradual increase in religiousness, however, the same authors have also found that people who suddenly deconverted from a religion, such as agnostics and atheists also scored higher in childhood insecure attachments to a mother or father.&lt;ref&gt;''Attachment, Evolution and the Psychology of Religion'' by Lee A. Kirkpatrick, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly to insecure parental attachment, insecure romantic attachment predicts sudden religious conversions and deconversions.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;  

===Correspondence pathway===

Bowlby&lt;ref name="Bowlby"/&gt; suggests attachment patterns continue across time partly because the way a person sees themselves and others ([[Attachment theory|internal working model]]) guides behavioral, emotional, and cognitive responses in social interactions over the life span.  The correspondence hypothesis suggests individual differences in religious beliefs and experience should correspond with individual differences in the internal working models and attachment patterns.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;  This theory suggests a "secure" IWM of self and others predicts viewing God as supporting.  A person with a preoccupied or anxious attachment may be expected to have a deeply emotional, grasping relationship with God, while a person with an avoidant attachment would be expected to view God as remote or inaccessible.&lt;ref name="Granqvist. Mikulincer, Shaver"/&gt;

The correspondence hypothesis suggests securely attached people would be expected to reflect the religious standards while insecurely attached people would not be expected to reflect their attachment figure’s religious standards.&lt;ref name="Granqvist"&gt;Granqvist, P. (2002). Attachment and religiosity in adolescence: Cross-sectional and longitudinal evaluations. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', 28(2), 260-270. doi:10.1177/0146167202282011&lt;/ref&gt;  People who report being more cared for by parents score higher on measures of religiousness, but only if their parents also displayed high levels of religiosity.&lt;ref name="Granqvist"/&gt; Another study found that such people had a higher assessed religiosity as socially rooted in the parental relationship.  This aspect of the correspondence hypothesis, that is, people reflecting attachment figure’s religious standards, can be called "[[Correspondence principle (sociology)|social correspondence]]".&lt;ref name="Granqvist"/&gt;

Even though the '''[[Bahá'í Faith]] in [[India]]''' is tiny in proportion of the national population, it is numerically large and has a long history culminating in recent times with the notable [[Lotus Temple]], various [[Bahá'í school]]s, and increasing prominence.

== History ==

=== Establishment ===

==== Bábí period ====
The roots of the Bahá'í Faith in India go back to the first days of the [[Bábí]] religion in 1844.&lt;ref name="brief"&gt;[http://www.bahaindia.org/intro/history.html The Bahá'í Faith - Brief History] National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of India.&lt;/ref&gt; Four Babís are known from India in this earliest period.&lt;ref name="sepher01"&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/notes/vol5/hunud.htm Historical Accounts of two Indian Babis: Sa'in Hindi and Sayyid Basir Hindi] By Sepehr Manuchehri, Research Notes in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies, Vol. 5, no. 2 (April, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; The first was Sa'id Hindi, one of the [[Letters of the Living]], and a second was only known as Qahru'llah.&lt;ref name="sepher99"&gt;[http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/notes/vol3/taqiya.htm The Practice of Taqiyyah (Dissimulation) in the Babi and Bahai Religions] by Sepehr Manuchehri, Research Notes in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies, Vol. 3, no. 3 (September 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Two other very early Bábís were Sa'in Hindi and Sayyid Basir Hindi.&lt;!-- note, not a typo - Sa'id is not Sa'in --&gt; Additionally, four other Indians are listed among the 318 Bábís who fought at the [[Battle of Fort Tabarsi]].&lt;ref name="momen99"&gt;{{cite journal| url = http://bahai-library.com/bsr/bsr09/9B2_momen_jamal.htm | title =Jamál Effendi and the early spread of the Bahá’í Faith in Asia| first =Moojan| last=  Momen| journal = [[Baha'i Studies Review]]| volume =9| origyear = 1999| year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little evidence of any contact from these early Indian Babis back to their homeland.

==== Early Bahá'í period ====

During [[Bahá'u'lláh]]'s lifetime, as founder of the religion, he encouraged some of his followers to move to India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/encyclopedia_history Bahá'í History] by Moojan Momen and Peter Smith&lt;/ref&gt; Some who settled in India including Hájí Sayyid Mírzá and Sayyid Muhammad who had become Bábís after meeting Bahá'u'lláh in Baghdad in the 1850s. Hájí Sayyid Mahmúd also traded in Bombay. These individuals were very successful as general merchants and commission agents but it was near another 50 years before native converts began.&lt;ref name="momen99" /&gt; A Baha'i teacher was asked for and Jamál Effendi was sent approximately 1875.&lt;ref name="momen99" /&gt; Still in these early years another member of the family of the [[Báb]], Mírzá Ibrahím, helped establish the first Bahá'í printing and publishing company, the Násirí Press, in Bombay and began to publish Bahá'í books from about 1882-3 onwards.&lt;ref name="momen99" /&gt; [[Kitáb-i-Íqán|The Book of Certitude]] and the [[Secret of Divine Civilization]] were both published in 1882.&lt;ref name="garlington"&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/bhpapers/india1.htm The Baha'i Faith in India: A Developmental Stage Approach] by William Garlington, Occasional Papers in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies, No. 2 (June, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Much later – in 1891 – Jamál Effendi was confused with a terrorist and reported on by British agents among the Indian population and those records have been found (though Indian government national archives.)&lt;ref name="momen99" /&gt; Following the passing of Bahá'u'lláh, as the leadership of the religion fell to [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], he in turn sent further emissaries in his stead – both Persian and American.&lt;ref name="garlington" /&gt;

Professor Pritam Singh is believed to be the first member of the Sikh community in India to accept the Bahá'í Faith, and the first to publish a Bahá'í weekly magazine in India. He learned of the religion from Mirzá Mahmud soon after his graduation from the University of Calcutta in 1904.&lt;ref name="brief" /&gt; By 1908 the Bahá'í [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] and representatives of `Abdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, had produced functioning communities in Bombay, [[Calcutta]], [[Aligarh]] and [[Lahore]].&lt;ref name="garlington" /&gt; Narayenrao Rangnath Shethji is believed to be the first convert from Hindu background. Better known as Vakil, he was born in a well-known Hindu family in [[Navsari|Nawsari]]. He became a Bahá'í in 1909.&lt;ref name="brief" /&gt; Representatives of the Indian [[Zoroastrian]] community had been sent to Persia to help their coreligionists. There they came into contact with the religion and supported its activities. Later, several Iranian Zoroastrian converts to the religion traveled to Bombay (notably Mulla Bahram Akhtar-Khavari) and actively promulgated their new religion among local Zoroastrians.&lt;ref name="garlington" /&gt;

As early as 1910 the national community in India was being urged to distinguish itself from Islam by Bahá'í institutions of America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_star_west_1&amp;chapter=11 Letter from the House of Spirituality of Bahais, Chicago, Ill., U. S. A. to the Assembly of Bomday India.]&lt;/ref&gt; National coordinated activities began and reached a peak with the December 1920, first All-India Bahá'í Convention, held in Bombay for three days. Representatives from India's major religious communities were present as well as Baha'i delegates from throughout the country. The resolutions arrived at included the collection of funds to build a ''Baha'i temple'', the establishment of a ''Baha'i school'' and the ''growth of teaching and translation work''&lt;ref name="garlington" /&gt; – goals reached before the end of the century (see below.)

[[File:Portrait Gandhi.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] famously commented, "The [[Bahá'í Faith]] is a solace to humankind."]]

Following the passing of `Abdu'l-Bahá, [[Shoghi Effendi]] was appointed head of the religion and he soon set about the formation of the first round of [[National Spiritual Assemblies]] in the world in 1923 and India's was in that first wave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1#22 The Bahá'í Faith: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bahá'í Teaching &amp; Consolidation Plan 1953-1963], Compiled by [[Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land, pages 22 and 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930 notable Bahá'í and world traveler [[Martha Root]] made an extensive trip though India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Miss Martha Root in India (I) | journal = Bahá'í News |date=October 1930 | pages = 7–8 (continued...) | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm | issue = 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Miss Martha Root in India (II) | journal = Bahá'í News |date=November 1930 | pages = 10–11 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm | issue = 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Bahá'í summer school was able to be held in [[Shimla|Simla]] in 1938 and in 1941 three new local communities with functioning [[Local Spiritual Assembly|Local Spiritual Assemblies]] had been established: [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]] and [[Bangalore]]. These activities reached a peak with occasional awareness of the social leaders in India like [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/gandhimohan_gandhi_bahais_nonviolence#10 Mahatma Gandhi and the Bahá'ís] - Striving towards a Nonviolent Civilization, by M. V. Gandhimohan, Copyright © 2000, Bahá'í Publishing Trust of India, New Delhi, {{ISBN|81-86953-82-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time his comment "The Bahá'í Faith is a solace to humankind." appeared in ''[[The Bombay Chronicle]]'' newspaper on May 24, 1944, during the centenary of the Bahá'í Faith and the Indian Bahá'í community consisted of twenty-nine Local Spiritual Assemblies.&lt;ref name="garlington" /&gt;

Through the first half of the twentieth century, the Bahá'ís continue to grow with a focus away from the large cities and had the notable achievement of the conversion of Kishan Lal Malviya, a [[Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes|scheduled caste]] leader from [[Shajapur]] (a district northeast of [[Ujjain]]) and another scheduled caste leader, Dayaram Malviya, also converted setting the stage for a rural dynamic of growth called "mass teaching". And Shirin Fozdar rose to prominence and served as a member of the [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the Bahá'ís of India from 1936 to 1951. Her main area of work from 1925 to 1950 was in a large community of Untouchables or [[Harijans]] in [[Ahmedabad]].&lt;ref name="sharin"&gt;{{cite journal | url =http://www.religiousunity.org/BahArt/Shirin%20Fozdar.htm | title = Shirin Fozdar: An Outstanding Pioneer | first = Anil | last = Sarwal | journal = Bahá'í Digest | year = 1989 | accessdate = 2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growth ===

After more than a century the Bahá'í Faith in India had only reached around 1,000&lt;ref name="garlington" /&gt; and for a significant time there hadn't even been an Indian-based community in India. Various social and religious forces encouraged a broader outreach for the aims of the teaching activities of the religion. It was a time of "[[Entry by troops#Mass Teaching|mass teaching]]".&lt;ref name="garlington" /&gt; The [[Bahá'í teachings]] were adapted for presentation to a clearly [[Hindu]] context familiar to the people of the countryside, using principles and language familiar to them:&lt;ref name="garlington" /&gt;

* the presentation of Bahá'u'lláh as the [[kalki]] [[Avatar]] who according to the [[Vishnu Purana]] will appear at the end of the [[kali yuga]] for the purpose of reestablishing an era of righteousness
* emphasizing the figures of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and [[Krishna]] as past [[Manifestations of God]] or [[Avatar]]s,
* references to Hindu scriptures such as the [[Bhagavad Gita]],
* the substitution of [[Sanskrit]]-based terminology for [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] where possible (i.e., Bhagavan Baha for Bahá'u'lláh), and the incorporation in both song (''[[bhajan]]'')&lt;ref name="garlington-bhajans"&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/bhpapers/vol2/india2.htm The Baha'i Bhajans: An example of the Baha'i Use of Hindu Symbols] by William Garlington, Occasional Papers in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies, Vol. 2, No. 1 (January, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; and literature of Hindu holy places, hero-figures and poetic images.
* Hindi translations of Baha'i scriptures and prayers that appeared during this period which are so heavily Sanskritized as to make it difficult to recognize their non-Hindu antecedents.

Together with the teaching of the [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of humanity]] these approaches attracted many of the lower [[caste]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/nolley_bahai_population_india Notes on Bahá'í population in India] by Charles Nolley and William Garlington, 1997-03&lt;/ref&gt; In short order most of a tiny village of some 200 people converted to the Baha'i Faith ''en masse''.&lt;ref name="garlington" /&gt; The following year hundreds of people adopted the religion thanks to an open air conference where speeches could be heard. In two more years almost as many people converted as had been Bahá'ís through regions of [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Gujarat]]. In 1961 there were a total of 78 Local Spiritual Assemblies and less than 1,000 believers and in 1963 there were some 65,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = N. Richard | last = Francis | title = Rahmatu'llah Muhajir - Hand of the Cause of God, the Treasure of All Humanity | year = 1998 | publisher = Bahá'í Faith Website of Reno, Nevada | url = http://bahai-library.com/francis_muhajir_biography }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1970 these figures had risen to 3,350 Assemblies and 312,602 believers.&lt;ref name="garlington" /&gt; However, in contrast to the [[Neo-Buddhist]] movement, no effort was made to denounce Hinduism&lt;ref name="garlington" /&gt; and progress along Bahá'í ideals advanced: Assemblies formed in response to growing numbers of Baha'is, the House of Worship for India was built, and schools were established – all goals of the first All-India Baha'i Convention in 1920 (see above).

During this period of growth, six conferences held in October 1967 around the world presented a viewing of a copy of the photograph of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] on the highly significant occasion commemorating the centenary of Bahá'u'lláh's writing of the ''[[Suriy-i-Mulúk]]'' (Tablet to the Kings), which [[Shoghi Effendi]] describes as "the most momentous Tablet revealed by Bahá'u'lláh".&lt;ref name="bpg"&gt;{{cite book |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/|page = 171}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a meeting in Edirne ([[Adrianople]]), Turkey, the [[Hands of the Cause]] travelled to the conferences, 'each bearing the precious trust of a photograph of the Blessed Beauty, which it will be the privilege of those attending the Conferences to view.'

[[File:Bahai-house-of-worship-delhi2.jpg|thumb|right|The Bahá'í House of Worship in New Delhi.]]
The [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in [[Delhi]], [[India]], popularly known as the Lotus Temple, is a prominent attraction in Delhi. It was completed in 1986 and serves as the Mother Temple of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It has won numerous architectural awards and been featured in hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles,&lt;ref name="bahap"&gt;[http://www.uga.edu/bahai/india.html Bahá'í Houses of Worship, India] The Lotus of Bahapur&lt;/ref&gt; and CNN reported it as the most visited building in the world in 2015.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news | title =Encore Presentation: A Visit to the Capital of India: New Delhi | newspaper =Cable News Network | date =July 14, 2001 | url =http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0107/14/i_hs.00.html| accessdate = Jan 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few international dignitaries have also visited.

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. There are some seven educational institutions the Baha'is of India have undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bahaindia.org/social/index.html Socia-Economic Development Projects]&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the more well known are:

=== Prominence ===

[[File:Bahai-House-Chandigarh-01.JPG|thumb|Baha'i house in Chandigarh.]]

Following the successes in large scale growth in numbers and organization with commitment to raise up a Temple and schools, the Baha'i Faith in India has awakened degrees of prominence.

* Amongst other important engagements during his state visit to India from 5–7 November 1999, [[Pope John Paul II]] attended an inter-religious meeting. Against a backdrop of protests by various sectarian groups against ecumenism, this particular function had aroused interest. Distinguished representatives of nine religions, including Mrs. Zena Sorabjee of the Baha'i community, shared the platform with Pope John Paul. Many ambassadors, highranking government officials, political and civic leaders and intellectuals, as well as cardinals, archbishops and other senior religious dignitaries, were present at this unique event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/newspapers/1999/110799.html Pope Addressed by Baha'is in India]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protest of persecution in Iran ===

{{Main|Persecution of Baha'is#Iran}}

The governments of India and Iran generally maintain [[India-Iran relations|good relations]]. In 2001, the government of India voted against the United Nations resolution ''Situation of Human Rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran'' raised in response to the [[persecution of Bahá'ís]] in Iran,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bahá'í International Community | first = | authorlink = Bahá'í International Community | title = UN General Assembly Resolution 2001 | work = | publisher = Bahá'í International Community | year = 2008 | url =http://info.bahai.org/article-1-8-3-23.html | doi = | accessdate = 2009-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has voted against many such resolutions since that time. Despite this, many officials and prominent citizens of India have expressed serious concerns about the persecution of Bahá'ís.

[[File:Justice J S Verma, Jagadish Sharan Verma.jpg|thumb|right|Former Chief Justice [[Jagdish Sharan Verma|J. S. Verma]], one of many prominent Indians who have called for the release of imprisoned Baha'is in Iran.]]
In June 2008 several leading jurists of India's legal system, journalists, and civil rights activist signed an open letter urging Iran to abide by international human rights conventions and calling for the immediate release of Baha'is detained in the country. Signatories included:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Iran asked to stop persecution of Baha’is | newspaper = The Tribune, Chandigarh, India |publisher = The Tribune Trust | pages = | date = 2008-06-19 | url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2008/20080620/main6.htm | postscript = &lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; former Chief Justice of India Justice [[Jagdish Sharan Verma]], former Supreme Court judge Justice [[V.R.

A similar open letter was published in February 2009, and signed by more than 30 prominent Indians, including Justice Iyer, actor [[Aamir Khan]], Maulana Khalid Rasheed, Swami Agnivesh, and many more. Calls for the release of imprisoned Baha'is have continued since that time, with many prominent Indians expressing their concern.&lt;ref name="thehindu-jan2010"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Concern-over-persecution-of-Baharsquois-in-Iran/article16836695.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|title=Concern over persecution of Baha’is in Iran|date=2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{History of Iran}}
The '''Bavand dynasty''' ({{Lang-fa|باوندیان}}) (also spelled '''Bavend'''), or simply the '''Bavandids''', was an Iranian dynasty that ruled in parts of [[Tabaristan]] ([[Mazandaran province|Mazandaran]]) in what is now northern [[Iran]] from 651 until 1349, alternating between outright independence and submission as vassals to more powerful regional rulers.

== Origins ==
The dynasty itself traced its descent back to Bav, who was alleged to be a grandson of the [[Sasanian]] prince [[Kawus]], brother of [[Khosrau I]],{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|p=27-28}} and son of the shah [[Kavadh I]] (ruled 488–531), who supposedly fled to [[Tabaristan]] from the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. He rallied the locals around him, repelled the first Arab attacks, and reigned for fifteen years until he was murdered by a certain [[Valash]], who ruled the country for eight years. Bav's son, Sohrab or Sorkab ([[Surkhab I]]), established himself at Perim on the eastern mountain ranges of Tabaristan, which thereafter became the family's domain.{{sfn|Madelung|1984|pp=747–753}}{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|pp=292–293}} The scholar J. Marquart, however, proposed an alternative identification of the legendary Bav with a late-6th-century Zoroastrian priest ("[[magian]]") from [[Ray, Iran|Ray]].{{sfn|Madelung|1984|pp=747–753}}{{sfn|Frye|1986|p=1110}} P. Pourshariati, in her re-examination of late Sasanian history, asserts that this Bav is a conflation of several members of the powerful [[House of Ispahbudhan]]: [[Bawi]], his grandson [[Vistahm]] and his great-nephew [[Farrukhzad]].{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|pp=289–294}} She also reconstructs the events of the middle 7th century as a civil war between two rival clans, the Ispahbudhan and Valash's [[House of Karen]], before the [[Dabuyid]] [[Farrukhan the Great]] conquered Tabaristan and subdued the various local leaders to vassalage. The Dabuyid house then ruled Tabaristan until the [[Abbasids]] subdued the region in 760.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2008|pp=304–318}}

== History ==
It is at the time after the Abbasid conquest that the Bavandids enter documented history, with [[Sharwin I]], in later tradition accounted the great-grandson of Surkhab I.{{sfn|Madelung|1984|pp=747–753}} The dynasty is commonly divided into three major branches: the '''Kayusiyya''', named after Kayus ibn Kubad, the Arabicized name of the family's legendary ancestor Kawus son of Kavadh, which ruled from 665 until 1006, when the family's rule was ended by [[Qabus ibn Wushmagir]].{{sfn|Frye|1986|p=1110}} Several members of the family continued to rule in various localities thereafter, giving rise to the second line, the '''Ispahbadhiyya''', in 1073. Their capital was [[Sari, Iran|Sari]],{{sfn|Bosworth|1968|p=27-28}} and their rule extended over [[Gilan]], Ray and [[Qumis (region)|Qumis]] as well as Tabaristan, although they were  mostly vassals of the [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuqs]] and later of the [[Khwarezmshah]]s. The line was ended in 1210 with the murder of [[Rustam V]], and the Khwarezmshah [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Muhammad II]] took over direct control of the region.{{sfn|Frye|1986|p=1110}} The third line or '''Kinakhwariyya''' was established in 1237 following the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasions and the widespread anarchy that prevailed, and lasted, as a vassal of the Mongols, until the final end of the dynasty in 1349.{{sfn|Frye|1986|p=1110}}

=== Kayusiyya line ===
Following the demise of the Dabuyids, two major local dynasties were left in Tabaristan: the Bavandids in the eastern mountains and the Karenids, who also appropriated the heritage of the Dabuyid rulers, in the central and western mountain ranges. Both claimed Sasanian origin and titelature, with the Bavandids styling themselves as "kings of [[Tabaristan]]" and, like the Karenids, claiming the title of ''[[ispahbadh]]''.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|pp=200–202}}

Sharwin I, along with the Karenid ruler [[Vandad Hormozd]], led the native resistance to Muslim rule and the efforts at Islamization and settlement begun by the Abbasid governor, [[Khalid ibn Barmak]] (768–772). Following his departure, the native princes destroyed the towns he had built in the highlands, and although in 781 they affirmed loyalty to the Caliphate, in 782 they launched a general anti-Muslim revolt that was not suppressed until 785, when [[Sa'id al-Harashi]] led 40,000 troops into the region.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|p=202}} Relations with the caliphal governors in the lowlands improved thereafter, but the Bavandid and Karenid princes remained united in their opposition to Muslim penetration of the highlands, to the extent that they prohibited even the burial of Muslims there. Isolated acts of defiance like the murder of a tax collector occurred, but when the two princes were summoned before [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 805 they promised loyalty and the payment of a tax, and were forced to leave their sons behind as hostages for four years.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|pp=202, 204}}

After his death in 817, Sharvin was succeeded by his grandson, [[Shahriyar I]], who managed to evict the Karenid [[Mazyar]] from his own realm. Mazyar fled to the court of the Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]], became a Muslim and in 822/23 returned with the support of the Abbasid governor to exact revenge: Shahriyar's son and successor, [[Shapur (Bavandid ruler)|Shapur]], was defeated and killed, and Mazyar united the highlands under his own rule. His growing power brought him into conflict with the Muslim settlers at [[Amul]], but he was able to take the city and receive acknowledgement of his rule over all of Tabaristan from the caliphal court. Eventually, however, he quarreled with [[Abdallah ibn Tahir]], and in 839, he was captured by the [[Tahirids]], who now took over control of Tabaristan.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|pp=204–205}} The Bavandids exploited the opportunity to regain their ancestral lands: Shapur's brother, [[Qarin I]], assisted the Tahirids against Mazyar, and was rewarded with his brother's lands and royal title. In 842, he converted to Islam.{{sfn|Madelung|1984|pp=747–753}}{{sfn|Madelung|1975|pp=205–206}}

This period saw the rapid Islamization of the native population of Tabaristan. Although the majority accepted [[Sunni Islam]], [[Shi'ism]] also spread, especially in Amul and the neighboruing areas of [[Astarabad]] and [[Gurgan]]. Thus, in 864, a [[Zaydi]] [[Alid]], [[Hasan ibn Zayd]], was invited to Tabaristan, and with support from the [[Daylamites]] took over control of the province.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|pp=206–207}} The Bavandids remained steadfastly opposed to the [[Alid dynasties of northern Iran|Alid dynasty]] throughout its existence, and Qarin's grandson [[Rustam I]] was to pay with his life for this: in 895, the Alid supporter [[Rafi' ibn Harthama]] tortured him to death.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|p=207}} The Sunni [[Samanids]] drove out the Alids in 900, but in 914 a relative of Hasan ibn Zayd, [[Hasan al-Utrush]], managed to drive out the Samanids, restore Alid control over the province, and force even the Bavandids and Karinids to accept his rule.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|pp=207–209}}

The history of the Bavandis is detailed in the works of Ibn Isfandiar and Mar'ashi which belong to the genre of local histories that gained popularity in Iran after 1000 AD. We know that they were related to the [[Ziyarid]] dynasty, through the marriage of Mardanshah, the father of Ziyar, to the daughter of one of the Bavandi kings. The prominence of the Bavandi kings apparently continued throughout the [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] and [[Mongol]] period. One of their greatest kings, [[Shah Ghazi Rustam V]], is reported to have seriously defeated the Ismailis who were gaining prominence in Tabaristan and to have made significant progress in consolidating power in the Caspian provinces.

After the Mongol conquest, the Bavandis continued to rule as local strongmen of Tabaristan and sometimes Dailam. Their power was finally brought down around 1350 when [[Kiya Afrasiyab]] of the [[Afrasiyab dynasty]], themselves an offshoot of the Bavandis, managed to kill [[Hasan II of Tabaristan]], the last of the mainline Bavandi kings.

== Culture ==
The Bavandids stressed their lineage with the Sasanian Empire. As late as the early 13th-century, their coronation customs were assumed to go back to the remote past, as depicted thorough by the 13th-century Iranian historian [[Ibn Isfandiyar]];{{sfn|Babaie|Grigor|2015|p=157}}

{{Cquote|The coronation festivities lasted seven days, according to the old Iranian fashion, and included the usual feastings, rejoicings, giving of presents, while the notables and ''[[ispahbad]]s'' and Bavandids assembled from all the countryside. When these congratulations were finished, on the eight day the ''ispahad'' ascended the throne, girded on the royal girdle, and confirmed the governors in their appointments, and caused the ''ispahbads'' and ''amirs'' to cast aside their mourning, and clad them in robes of honour.}}

His successors ruled as [[Chhatrapati]]s (emperors) from their capital at [[Satara (city)|Satara]], although ''de facto'' rule of the empire passed to the [[Peshwa]]s, the [[Maratha]] hereditary chief ministers, during the reign of [[Chhattrapati Shahu|Shahu I]]. In addition to the Bhonsle [[Chhatrapati]]s of Satara, rulers of the Bhonsle clan established themselves as junior branch of [[Chhatrapati]]s at [[Kolhapur]], and as [[Maharaja]]s of [[Kingdom of Nagpur|Nagpur]] in modern-day [[Maharashtra]] in the 18th century.

After the British defeat of the Marathas in the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]] in 1818, the four Bhonsle dynasties continued as rulers of their [[princely state]]s, acknowledging British suzerainty while retaining local autonomy. The states of Satara, Thanjavur, and Nagpur came under direct British rule in the mid-nineteenth century when their rulers died without male heirs, although the British allowed titular adoptions to take place. [[Kolhapur (princely state)|Kolhapur state]] remained autonomous until India's independence in 1947, when the rulers acceded to the Indian government.

Bhonsles claim their origin from [[Suryavansha|Suryavanshi]] [[Sisodia|Sisodia Rajputs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society (Bangalore).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uQFuAAAAMAAJ|year=1975 |page=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Singh K S|title=India's communities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1lZuAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-563354-2 |page=2211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="(India)1967"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maharashtra (India)|title=Maharashtra State Gazetteers: Maratha period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EXtEAQAAIAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Directorate of Government Printing, Stationary and Publications, Maharashtra State |page=147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources supporting this claim include [[Pandit Gaga Bhatt|Pandit Ganga Bhatt]] of [[Varanasi]], who had been hired for the purpose by Shivaji, and in 1674 presented a genealogy tracing Shivaji's ancestry to the Sisodias of [[Mewar]].&lt;ref name="Allison2011"&gt;{{cite book |first=Allison |last=Busch |title=Poetry of Kings: The Classical Hindi Literature of Mughal India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dl0sbzehWvAC&amp;pg=PA191 |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-976592-8 |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as [[Jadunath Sarkar]] have contested Shivaji's Rajput origin, saying that it was a fabrication required during his coronation.&lt;ref name="Apte1974"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bhalchandra Krishna Apte|title=Chhatrapati Shivaji: coronation tercentenary commemoration volume|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jx48AAAAMAAJ|year=1974|publisher=University of Bombay |page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[Chintaman Vinayak Vaidya|C. V. Vaidya]], do not accept this and point to works authored before his rise that refer to the connection. For example, the ''Radha Madhav Vilas Champu'', written by the poet [[Jayaram]], mentions [[Shahaji|Shahaji Bhonsle]], the father of Shivaji, as being a Sisodia Rajput and Shahji's letter to Sultan [[Adil Shah]] in 1641 refers to the Bhonsle as Rajputs.&lt;ref name="Bakshi1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shiri Ram Bakshi|title=Sharad Pawar, the Maratha legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iP433CnEW_gC&amp;pg=PA25|accessdate=15 May 2011|year=1998|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=978-81-7648-007-9|pages=25–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of Persian-language [[firman]]s in the 1920s also dented the claim of those such as Sarkar. The documents bear seals and [[tughra]] of [[Bahmani Sultanate|Bahmani]] and [[Bijapur Sultanate|Adil Shahi]] sultans and establish the direct descent of Shivaji and [[Ghorpade]] with that of Sisodia of [[Chittor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXxjo0OY2oQC&amp;pg=PA17 |title=Mahrattas, Sikhs and Southern Sultans of India: Their Fight Against Foreign Power |first=H.

&lt;!-- Positions --&gt;
The positions of the world's major medical organizations range from considering elective circumcision of babies and children as having no benefit and significant risks to having a modest health benefit that outweighs small risks.

== Uses ==

=== Elective ===
Neonatal circumcision is usually [[elective surgery|elected]] by the parents for non-medical reasons, such as religious beliefs or personal preferences, possibly driven by societal norms.&lt;ref name=hay_2012/&gt; Outside the parts of Africa with high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, the positions of the world's major medical organizations on non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision range from considering it as having a modest net health benefit that outweighs small risks to viewing it as having no benefit with significant risks for harm.&lt;!-- ref name=Bolnick_2012_ch1 --&gt; No major medical organization recommends universal neonatal circumcision, and no major medical organization calls for banning it either.&lt;!-- ref name=Bolnick_2012_ch1 --&gt; The [[Royal Dutch Medical Association]], which expresses some of the strongest opposition to routine neonatal circumcision, argues that while there are valid reasons for banning it, doing so could lead parents who insist on the procedure to turn to poorly trained practitioners instead of medical professionals.&lt;ref name=Bolnick_2012_ch1/&gt;&lt;ref name="knmg.nl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-therapeutic circumcision of male minors - KNMG Viewpoint|url=https://www.knmg.nl/advies-richtlijnen/knmg-publicaties/publications-in-english.htm|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument to keep the procedure within the purview of medical professionals is found across all major medical organizations.&lt;!-- ref name=Bolnick_2012_ch1 --&gt; In addition, the organizations advise medical professionals to yield to some degree to parental preferences, which are commonly based upon cultural or religious views, in their decision to agree to circumcise.&lt;ref name=Bolnick_2012_ch1/&gt; The Danish College of General Practitioners states that circumcision should "only [be done] when medically needed, otherwise it is a case of mutilation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Referat bestyrelsesmøde den 16. december 2013|url=http://www.dsam.dk/flx/organisation/bestyrelse/referater/dagsorden_05122013//?Highlight=omsk%E6ring#flxElm_3725|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical===
Circumcision may be used to treat pathological [[phimosis]], refractory [[balanoposthitis]] and chronic or recurrent [[urinary tract infection]]s (UTIs).&lt;ref name=lissauer_2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=hay_2012/&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] promotes circumcision to prevent female-to-male HIV transmission in countries with high rates of HIV.&lt;ref name=WHO_HIV_2007/&gt; The [[International AIDS Society]]-USA also suggests circumcision be discussed with [[men who have sex with men|MSM]] who engage in primarily insertive anal sex, especially in areas where HIV is common.&lt;ref name="Marrazzo et al. 2014" /&gt;

The finding that circumcision significantly reduces female-to-male HIV transmission has prompted medical organizations serving communities affected by endemic HIV/AIDS to promote circumcision as an additional method of controlling the spread of HIV.&lt;ref name=Bolnick_2012_ch1/&gt;  The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS (2007) recommend circumcision as part of a comprehensive program for prevention of HIV transmission in areas with high endemic rates of HIV, as long as the program includes "[[informed consent]], [[confidentiality]], and absence of [[coercion]]".&lt;ref name=WHO_HIV_2007/&gt;

== Contraindications ==
Circumcision is [[contraindication|contraindicated]] in infants with certain [[sex organ|genital]] structure abnormalities, such as a misplaced [[external urethral orifice (male)|urethral opening]] (as in [[hypospadias]] and [[epispadias]]), curvature of the head of the penis ([[chordee]]), or [[ambiguous genitalia]], because the foreskin may be needed for reconstructive surgery.  Circumcision is contraindicated in [[preterm birth|premature]] infants and those who are not clinically stable and in good health.&lt;ref name=rudolph_2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=hay_2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO_Manual_2009/&gt; If an individual, child or adult, is known to have or has a family history of serious bleeding disorders ([[hemophilia]]), it is recommended that the blood be checked for normal [[coagulation]] properties before the procedure is attempted.&lt;ref name=hay_2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO_Manual_2009/&gt;

==Technique==
{{main|Circumcision surgical procedure}}
[[File:Circumcision illustration.jpg|thumb|right|Circumcision surgery with hemostats and scissors]]
[[File:Adult circumcision before and after.jpg|thumb|Before (left) and after (right) an adult circumcision, undertaken to treat [[phimosis]]. The glans is exposed even when the penis is flaccid.]]

The [[foreskin]] extends out from the base of the [[glans penis|glans]] and covers the glans when the penis is flaccid. Proposed theories for the purpose of the foreskin are that it serves to protect the penis as the fetus develops in the mother's womb, that it helps to preserve moisture in the glans, and that it improves sexual pleasure. The foreskin may also be a pathway of infection for certain diseases. Circumcision removes the foreskin at its attachment to the base of the glans.&lt;ref name=WHO_2007_GTDPSA/&gt;

===Removal of the foreskin===
For infant circumcision, [[circumcision clamp|devices]] such as the [[Gomco clamp]], [[Plastibell]] and [[Mogen clamp]] are commonly used in the USA.&lt;ref name=AAP_2012/&gt;  These follow the same basic procedure. First, the amount of foreskin to be removed is estimated. The practitioner opens the foreskin via the preputial [[body orifice|orifice]] to reveal the glans underneath and ensures it is normal before bluntly separating the inner lining of the foreskin ([[preputial mucosa|preputial epithelium]]) from its attachment to the glans. The practitioner then places the circumcision device (this sometimes requires a [[dorsal slit]]), which remains until blood flow has stopped. Finally, the foreskin is [[amputation|amputated]].&lt;ref name=AAP_2012/&gt; For older babies and adults, circumcision is often performed surgically without specialized instruments,&lt;ref name=WHO_Manual_2009/&gt; and alternatives such [[Unicirc]], [[Prepex]] or the [[Shang ring]] are available.&lt;ref name=WHO_adult_devices_2012/&gt;

===Pain management===
The circumcision procedure causes pain, and for neonates this pain may interfere with mother-infant interaction or cause other behavioral changes,&lt;ref name=perera_2010/&gt; so the use of [[analgesia]] is advocated.&lt;ref name=AAP_2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=CPSBC_2009/&gt; Ordinary procedural pain may be managed in [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] and non-pharmacological ways. Pharmacological methods, such as localized or regional pain-blocking injections and topical analgesic creams, are safe and effective.&lt;ref name=AAP_2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=lonngvist_2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=shockley_2011/&gt; The [[nerve block|ring block]] and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) are the most effective at reducing pain, and the ring block may be more effective than the DPNB. They are more effective than [[lidocaine/prilocaine|EMLA]] (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream, which is more effective than a [[placebo]].&lt;ref name=lonngvist_2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=shockley_2011/&gt; Topical creams have been found to irritate the skin of [[low birth weight]] infants, so penile nerve block techniques are recommended in this group.&lt;ref name=AAP_2012/&gt;

For infants, non-pharmacological methods such as the use of a comfortable, padded chair and a [[sucrose]] or non-sucrose pacifier are more effective at reducing pain than a placebo,&lt;ref name=shockley_2011/&gt; but the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP) states that such methods are insufficient alone and should be used to supplement more effective techniques.&lt;ref name=AAP_2012/&gt; A quicker procedure reduces duration of pain; use of the Mogen clamp was found to result in a shorter procedure time and less pain-induced stress than the use of the Gomco clamp or the Plastibell.&lt;ref name=shockley_2011/&gt; The available evidence does not indicate that post-procedure pain management is needed.&lt;ref name=AAP_2012/&gt;  For adults, [[topical anesthesia]], [[nerve block|ring block]], dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) and [[general anesthesia]] are all options,&lt;ref name=wolter_2008/&gt; and the procedure requires four to six weeks of abstinence from [[masturbation]] or intercourse to allow the wound to heal.&lt;ref name=WHO_Manual_2009/&gt;

==Effects==

===Sexually transmitted diseases===

====Human immunodeficiency virus====
{{Main|Circumcision and HIV}}

There is strong evidence that circumcision reduces the risk of men acquiring HIV infection in areas of the world with high rates of HIV.&lt;ref name=krieger_2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=siegfried_Cochrane_2009/&gt; Evidence among heterosexual men in sub-Saharan Africa shows an absolute decrease in risk of 1.8% which is a relative decrease of between 38&amp;nbsp;percent and 66&amp;nbsp;percent over two&amp;nbsp;years,&lt;ref name=siegfried_Cochrane_2009/&gt; and in this population studies rate it cost effective.&lt;ref name=uthman_2010/&gt; Whether it is of benefit in [[developed country|developed countries]] is undetermined.&lt;ref name=kim_2010/&gt;

There are plausible explanations based on human biology for how circumcision can decrease the likelihood of female-to-male HIV transmission. The [[epidermis (skin)|superficial skin layers]] of the penis contain [[Langerhans cell]]s, which are targeted by HIV; removing the foreskin reduces the number of these cells.  When an uncircumcised penis is erect during intercourse, any small tears on the inner surface of the foreskin come into direct contact with the vaginal walls, providing a pathway for transmission. When an uncircumcised penis is [[tumescence|flaccid]], the pocket between the inside of the foreskin and the head of the penis provides an environment conducive to pathogen survival; circumcision eliminates this pocket. Some experimental evidence has been provided to support these theories.&lt;ref name=weiss_2010_HIV/&gt;

The WHO and the [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS]] (UNAIDS) state that male circumcision is an efficacious intervention for HIV prevention, but should be carried out by well-trained medical professionals and under conditions of informed consent (parents' consent for their infant boys).&lt;ref name=WHO_2007_GTDPSA/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO_HIV_2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO_CandR_2007/&gt;  The WHO has judged circumcision to be a cost-effective public health intervention against the spread of HIV in Africa, although not necessarily more cost-effective than condoms.&lt;ref name=WHO_2007_GTDPSA/&gt; The joint WHO/UNAIDS recommendation also notes that circumcision only provides partial protection from HIV and should not replace known methods of HIV prevention.&lt;ref name=WHO_HIV_2007/&gt;

Male circumcision provides only indirect HIV protection for heterosexual women.&lt;ref name=AAP_2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=dinh_2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lei|first1=JH|last2=Liu|first2=LR|last3=Wei|first3=Q|last4=Yan|first4=SB|last5=Yang|first5=L|last6=Song|first6=TR|last7=Yuan|first7=HC|last8=Lv|first8=X|last9=Han|first9=P|title=Circumcision Status and Risk of HIV Acquisition during Heterosexual Intercourse for Both Males and Females: A Meta-Analysis|journal=PLOS ONE|date=5 May 2015|volume=10|issue=5|pages=e0125436|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0125436|pmid=25942703|pmc=4420461}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown whether or not circumcision reduces transmission when men engage in [[anal sex]] with a female partner.&lt;ref name=WHO_CandR_2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC_2008/&gt; Some evidence supports its effectiveness at reducing HIV risk in [[men who have sex with men]].&lt;ref name=Shar2017/&gt;

====Human papillomavirus====
[[Human papillomavirus]] (HPV) is the most commonly transmitted [[sexually transmitted infection]], affecting both men and women. While most infections are asymptomatic and are cleared by the [[immune system]], some types of the virus cause [[genital wart]]s, and other types, if untreated, cause various forms of cancer, including [[cervical cancer]], and [[carcinoma of the penis|penile cancer]]. Genital warts and cervical cancer are the two most common problems resulting from HPV.&lt;ref name=CDC_HPV/&gt;

Circumcision is associated with a reduced [[prevalence]] of [[carcinogenesis|oncogenic]] types of HPV infection, meaning that a randomly selected circumcised man is less likely to be found infected with cancer-causing types of HPV than an uncircumcised man.&lt;ref name=hpv_prevalence_ref_bundle/&gt;&lt;ref name=zhu&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhu|first1=YP|last2=Jia|first2=ZW|last3=Dai|first3=B|last4=Ye|first4=DW|last5=Kong|first5=YY|last6=Chang|first6=K|last7=Wang|first7=Y|title=Relationship between circumcision and human papillomavirus infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Asian Journal of Andrology|volume=19|issue=1|pages=125–131|date=8 March 2016|doi=10.4103/1008-682X.175092|pmid=26975489|pmc=5227661}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also decreases the likelihood of multiple infections.&lt;ref name=rehmeyer_2011/&gt;  No strong evidence indicates that it reduces the rate of new HPV infection,&lt;ref name=larke_HPV_2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=rehmeyer_2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=albero_2012/&gt; but the procedure is associated with increased [[clearance (medicine)|clearance]] of the virus by the body,&lt;ref name=larke_HPV_2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=rehmeyer_2011/&gt; which can account for the finding of reduced prevalence.&lt;ref name=rehmeyer_2011/&gt;

Although genital warts are caused by a type of HPV, there is no statistically significant relationship between being circumcised and the presence of genital warts.&lt;ref name=larke_HPV_2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=zhu/&gt;&lt;ref name=albero_2012/&gt;

====Other infections====
Studies evaluating the effect of circumcision on the rates of other sexually transmitted infections have generally, found it to be protective. A 2006 meta-analysis found that circumcision was associated with lower rates of [[syphilis]], [[chancroid]] and possibly genital [[herpes]].&lt;ref name=weiss_2006_syphilis/&gt; A 2010 review found that circumcision reduced the incidence of [[herpes simplex virus|HSV]]-2 (herpes simplex virus, type 2) infections by 28%.&lt;ref name=wetmore_2010/&gt; The researchers found mixed results for protection against [[trichomonas vaginalis]] and [[chlamydia trachomatis]] and no evidence of protection against [[gonorrhea]] or syphilis.&lt;ref name=wetmore_2010/&gt; It may also possibly protect against syphilis in men who have sex with men.&lt;ref name=templeton_2010/&gt;

===Phimosis, balanitis and balanoposthitis===
[[Phimosis]] is the inability to retract the foreskin over the glans penis.&lt;ref name=Hay2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayashi|first1=Y|last2=Kojima|first2=Y|last3=Mizuno|first3=K|last4=Kohri|first4=K|title=Prepuce: phimosis, paraphimosis, and circumcision|journal=TheScientificWorldJournal|date=3 February 2011|volume=11|pages=289–301|pmid=21298220|pmc=5719994|doi=10.1100/tsw.2011.31}}&lt;/ref&gt; At birth, the foreskin cannot be retracted due to [[adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]] between the foreskin and glans, and this is considered normal (physiological phimosis).&lt;ref name=Hay2011/&gt; Over time the foreskin naturally separates from the glans, and a majority of boys are able to retract the foreskin by age three.&lt;ref name=Hay2011/&gt; Less than one percent are still having problems at age 18.&lt;ref name=Hay2011/&gt; If the inability to do so becomes problematic (pathological phimosis) circumcision is a treatment option.&lt;ref name=lissauer_2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=becker_2011/&gt; This pathological phimosis may be due to scarring from the skin disease [[balanitis xerotica obliterans]] (BXO), repeated episodes of [[balanoposthitis]] or forced retraction of the foreskin.&lt;ref name=Moreno2014/&gt; [[Steroid]] creams are also a reasonable option and may prevent the need for surgery including in those with mild BXO.&lt;ref name=Moreno2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moreno|first1=G|last2=Corbalán|first2=J|last3=Peñaloza|first3=B|last4=Pantoja|first4=T|title=Topical corticosteroids for treating phimosis in boys|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=2 September 2014|volume=9|issue=9|pages=CD008973|pmid=25180668|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008973.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Celis|first1=S|last2=Reed|first2=F|last3=Murphy|first3=F|last4=Adams|first4=S|last5=Gillick|first5=J|last6=Abdelhafeez|first6=AH|last7=Lopez|first7=PJ|title=Balanitis xerotica obliterans in children and adolescents: a literature review and clinical series|journal=Journal of Pediatric Urology|date=February 2014|volume=10|issue=1|pages=34–9|pmid=24295833|doi=10.1016/j.jpurol.2013.09.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure may also be used to prevent the development of phimosis.&lt;ref name=hay_2012/&gt; Phimosis is also a complication that can result from circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krill|first1=Aaron|last2=Palmer|first2=Lane|last3=Palmer|first3=Jeffrey|title=Complications of Circumcision|journal=ScientificWorldJournal|date=2011|doi=10.1100/2011/373829|pmid=22235177|pmc=3253617|volume=11|pages=2458–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An inflammation of the glans penis and foreskin is called balanoposthitis, and the condition affecting the glans alone is called balanitis.&lt;ref name=leber_2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=osipov_2006/&gt;  Most cases of these conditions occur in uncircumcised males,&lt;ref name=aridogan_2011/&gt; affecting 4{{endash}}11% of that group.&lt;ref name=hayashi_2011/&gt;  The moist, warm space underneath the foreskin is thought to facilitate the growth of pathogens, particularly when hygiene is poor.  Yeasts, especially ''[[Candida albicans]]'', are the most common penile infection and are rarely identified in samples taken from circumcised males.&lt;ref name=aridogan_2011/&gt;  Both conditions are usually treated with topical antibiotics (metronidazole cream) and antifungals (clotrimazole cream) or low-potency steroid creams.&lt;ref name=leber_2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=osipov_2006/&gt; Circumcision is a treatment option for refractory or recurrent balanoposthitis, but in recent years the availability of the other treatments have made it less necessary.&lt;ref name=leber_2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=osipov_2006/&gt;

===Urinary tract infections===
A UTI affects parts of the [[urinary system]] including the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys under two years of age, and the majority of incidents occur in the first year of life. There is good but not [[randomized controlled trial|ideal evidence]] that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under two years of age, and there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 3{{endash}}10 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI).&lt;ref name=AAP_2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="MorrisWiswell2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Brian J.|last2=Wiswell|first2=Thomas E.|title=Circumcision and Lifetime Risk of Urinary Tract Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|journal=The Journal of Urology|volume=189|issue=6|year=2013|pages=2118–2124|issn=0022-5347|doi=10.1016/j.juro.2012.11.114|pmid=23201382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jagannath_2012/&gt;  Circumcision is most likely to benefit boys who have a high risk of UTIs due to anatomical defects,&lt;ref name=AAP_2012/&gt; and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.&lt;ref name=lissauer_2012/&gt;

There is a plausible biological explanation for the reduction in UTI risk after circumcision.  The orifice through which urine passes at the tip of the penis (the [[urinary meatus]]) hosts more urinary system disease-causing bacteria in uncircumcised boys than in circumcised boys, especially in those under six months of age.  As these bacteria are a risk factor for UTIs, circumcision may reduce the risk of UTIs through a decrease in the bacteria population.&lt;ref name=AAP_2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=jagannath_2012/&gt;

===Cancers===
Circumcision has a protective effect against the risks of penile cancer in men, and cervical cancer in the female sexual partners of heterosexual men. Penile cancer is rare, with about 1 new case per 100,000 people per year in developed countries and higher incidence rates per 100,000 in sub-Saharan Africa (for example: 1.6 in Zimbabwe, 2.7 in Uganda and 3.2 in Swaziland).&lt;ref name=larke_penile_cancer_2011/&gt; The number of new cases is also high in certain South American countries such as [[Paraguay]] and [[Uruguay]] at about 4.3 per 100,000.&lt;ref name=Bleeker2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bleeker | first1 = M.

The rates of routine neonatal circumcision over time have varied significantly by country.

==History==
{{Main|History of male circumcision}}
[[File:Mangbetu Beschneidungsmesser Museum Rietberg RAC 15.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Circumcision knife from the Congo; wood, iron; late 19th/early 20th century]]
Circumcision is the world's oldest planned surgical procedure, suggested by anatomist and [[hyperdiffusionism|hyperdiffusionist]] historian [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] to be over 15,000 years old, pre-dating recorded history. There is no firm consensus as to how it came to be practiced worldwide. One theory is that it began in one geographic area and spread from there; another is that several different cultural groups began its practice independently. In his 1891 work ''History of Circumcision'', physician [[Peter Charles Remondino]] suggested that it began as a less severe form of emasculating a captured enemy:  [[penis removal|penectomy]] or [[castration]] would likely have been fatal, while some form of circumcision would permanently mark the defeated yet leave him alive to serve as a slave.&lt;ref name=alanis_2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=gollaher_2001_ch1/&gt;

The history of the migration and evolution of the practice of circumcision is followed mainly through the cultures and peoples in two separate regions. In the lands south and east of the Mediterranean, starting with [[Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]], the procedure was practiced by the ancient [[Egyptians]] and the [[Semitic people|Semites]], and then by the Jews and Muslims, with whom the practice travelled to and was adopted by the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu Africans]]. In Oceania, circumcision is practiced by the [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian Aborigines]] and [[Polynesians]].&lt;ref name=gollaher_2001_ch1/&gt; There is also evidence that circumcision was practiced among the [[Aztec]] and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] civilizations in the Americas,&lt;ref name=WHO_2007_GTDPSA/&gt; but little detail is available about its history.&lt;ref name=alanis_2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=doyle_2005/&gt;

===Middle East, Africa and Europe===

Evidence suggests that circumcision was practiced in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] by the 4th millennium BCE, when the [[Sumer]]ians and the [[Semitic people|Semites]] moved into the area that is modern-day [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=doyle_2005/&gt;  The earliest historical record of circumcision comes from Egypt, in the form of an image of the circumcision of an adult carved into the tomb of Ankh-Mahor at [[Saqqara]], dating to about 2400{{endash}}2300 BCE.  Circumcision was done by the Egyptians possibly for hygienic reasons, but also was part of their obsession with purity and was associated with spiritual and intellectual development.  No well-accepted theory explains the significance of circumcision to the Egyptians, but it appears to have been endowed with great honor and importance as a [[rite of passage]] into adulthood, performed in a public ceremony emphasizing the continuation of family generations and fertility.  It may have been a mark of distinction for the elite:  the Egyptian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' describes the sun god [[Ra]] as having circumcised himself.&lt;ref name=alanis_2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=gollaher_2001_ch1/&gt;

Though secular scholars consider the story to be literary and not historical,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McNutt |first=Paula M. |title=Reconstructing the Society of Ancient Israel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hd28MdGNyTYC&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q=Abraham+patriarchal+%22known+history%22 |accessdate= |year=1999 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location= |isbn=978-0-664-22265-9 |page= |ref=harv |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207165338/https://books.google.com/books?id=hd28MdGNyTYC&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q=Abraham+patriarchal+%22known+history%22 |archivedate=2016-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; circumcision features prominently in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The narrative in [[Lech-Lecha#Genesis chapter 17|Genesis chapter 17]] describes the circumcision of [[Abraham]] and his relatives and slaves. In the same chapter, Abraham's descendants are commanded to circumcise their sons on the eighth day of life as part of a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with God.

In addition to proposing that circumcision was taken up by the Israelites purely as a religious mandate, scholars have suggested that Judaism's patriarchs and their followers adopted circumcision to make penile hygiene easier in hot, sandy climates; as a rite of passage into adulthood; or as a form of blood sacrifice.&lt;ref name=doyle_2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=gollaher_2001_ch1/&gt;&lt;ref name=encyc_judaica_2006/&gt;

[[Alexander the Great]] conquered the Middle East in the 4th century BCE, and in the following centuries ancient Greek cultures and values came to the Middle East. The Greeks abhorred circumcision, making life for circumcised Jews living among the Greeks (and later the Romans) very difficult. [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] outlawed circumcision, as did [[Hadrian]], which helped cause the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]].  During this period in history, Jewish circumcision called for the removal of only a part of the prepuce, and some [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] Jews attempted to look uncircumcised by stretching the extant parts of their foreskins. This was considered by the Jewish leaders to be a serious problem, and during the 2nd century CE they changed the requirements of Jewish circumcision to call for the complete removal of the foreskin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hirsch|first1=Emil G|last2= Kohler|first2=Kaufmann|last3=Jacobs|first3=Joseph|last4=Friedenwald|first4=Aaron|last5=Broydé|first5=Isaac|date=1906|title=Circumcision|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4391-circumcision|work=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]|quote=In order to prevent the obliteration of the 'seal of the covenant' on the flesh, as circumcision was henceforth called, the Rabbis, probably after the [[war of Bar Kokba]] (see Yeb. l.c.; Gen.

[[File:Ludovico Mazzolino - Circumcision - WGA14715.jpg|thumb|upright|The Circumcision of Jesus Christ, by [[Ludovico Mazzolino]]]]
A narrative in the Christian [[Gospel of Luke]] makes a brief mention of the [[circumcision of Jesus]], but the subject of physical circumcision itself is not part of the received teachings of Jesus.  [[Paul the Apostle]] reinterpreted circumcision as a spiritual concept, arguing the physical one to be unnecessary for Gentile converts to Christianity.  The teaching that physical circumcision was unnecessary for membership in a divine covenant was instrumental in the separation of Christianity from Judaism.  Although it is not explicitly mentioned in the [[Quran]] (early 7th century CE), circumcision is considered essential to Islam, and it is nearly universally performed among Muslims.  The practice of circumcision spread across the Middle East, North Africa, and Southern Europe with Islam.&lt;ref name=gollaher_2001_ch2/&gt;

[[Genghis Khan]], and the following Yuan Emperors in China forbade Islamic practices such as [[halal]] butchering and circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicpopulation.com/asia/China/China_integration%20of%20religious%20minority.pdf |title=The Integration of Religious Minorities in China: The Case of Chinese Muslims |author=Donald Daniel Leslie |year=1998 |page=12 |publisher=The Fifty-ninth George Ernest Morrison Lecture in Ethnology |accessdate=30 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217112014/http://islamicpopulation.com/asia/China/China_integration%20of%20religious%20minority.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=N7_4Gr9Q438C&amp;pg=PA230&amp;dq=yuan+dynasty+halal&amp;q=yuan+dynasty+halal#v=onepage&amp;q=%20halal%20chinggis%20khan%20you%20are%20our%20slaves%20|title=Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road|author=Johan Elverskog|year=2010|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|edition=illustrated|location=|pages=228|isbn=978-0-8122-4237-9|accessdate=2010-06-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111113045/http://books.google.com/books?id=N7_4Gr9Q438C&amp;pg=PA230&amp;dq=yuan+dynasty+halal&amp;q=yuan+dynasty+halal#v=onepage&amp;q=%20halal%20chinggis%20khan%20you%20are%20our%20slaves%20|archivedate=2014-01-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led Chinese Muslims to eventually take an active part in rebelling against the Mongols and installing the more tolerant Ming Dynasty.

The practice of circumcision is thought to have been brought to the Bantu-speaking tribes of Africa by either the Jews after one of their many expulsions from European countries, or by Muslim Moors escaping after the 1492 conquest of Spain. In the second half of the 1st millennium CE, inhabitants from the North East of Africa moved south and encountered groups from Arabia, the Middle East, and West Africa. These people moved south and formed what is known today as the Bantu. Bantu tribes were observed to be upholding what was described as Jewish law, including circumcision, in the 16th century. Circumcision and elements of Jewish dietary restrictions are still found among Bantu tribes.&lt;ref name=doyle_2005/&gt;

===Indigenous peoples===
Circumcision is practiced by some groups amongst [[Australian Aboriginal]] peoples, [[Polynesians]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].  Little information is available about the origins and history of circumcision among these peoples, compared to circumcision in the Middle East.

For Aboriginal Australians and Polynesians, circumcision likely started as a blood sacrifice and a test of bravery and became an initiation rite with attendant instruction in manhood in more recent centuries.  Often seashells were used to remove the foreskin, and the bleeding was stopped with [[eucalyptus]] smoke.&lt;ref name=doyle_2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=gollaher_2001_ch3/&gt;

[[Christopher Columbus]] reported circumcision being practiced by Native Americans.&lt;ref name=alanis_2004/&gt;  It was also practiced by the [[Inca Empire|Incas]], Aztecs, and Mayans.  It probably started among South American tribes as a blood sacrifice or ritual mutilation to test bravery and endurance, and its use later evolved into a rite of initiation.&lt;ref name=doyle_2005/&gt;

===Modern times===
Circumcision did not become a common medical procedure in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone world]] until the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=darby_2003/&gt; At that time, British and American doctors began recommending it primarily as a deterrent to masturbation.&lt;ref name=darby_2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=gollaher_2001_ch4/&gt; Prior to the 20th century, masturbation was believed to be the cause of a wide range of physical and mental illnesses including epilepsy, paralysis, impotence, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, feeblemindedness, and insanity.&lt;ref name=bullough_1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=conrad_1992/&gt; In 1855, motivated in part by an interest in promoting circumcision to reduce masturbation, English physician [[Jonathan Hutchinson]] published his findings that Jews had a lower prevalence of certain venereal diseases.&lt;ref name=darby_2005/&gt; While pursuing a successful career as a general practitioner, Hutchinson went on to advocate circumcision for health reasons for the next fifty years,&lt;ref name=darby_2005/&gt; and eventually earned a [[knighthood]] for his overall contributions to medicine.&lt;ref name=matthew_2004/&gt; In America, one of the first modern physicians to advocate the procedure was [[Lewis Sayre]], a founder of the [[American Medical Association]]. In 1870, Sayre began using circumcision as a purported cure for several cases of young boys diagnosed with paralysis or significant motor problems. He thought the procedure ameliorated such problems based on a "reflex neurosis" theory of disease, which held that excessive stimulation of the genitals was a disturbance to the equilibrium of the nervous system and a cause of systemic problems.&lt;ref name=darby_2003/&gt; The use of circumcision to promote good health also fit in with the germ theory of disease during that time, which saw the foreskin as being filled with infection-causing [[smegma]] (a mixture of shed skin cells and oils).  Sayre published works on the subject and promoted it energetically in speeches.  Contemporary physicians picked up on Sayre's new treatment, which they believed could prevent or cure a wide-ranging array of medical problems and social ills.  Its popularity spread with publications such as Peter Charles Remondino's ''History of Circumcision''.  By the turn of the century, in both America and Great Britain, infant circumcision was near universally recommended.&lt;ref name=alanis_2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=gollaher_2001_ch4/&gt; David Gollaher proposes that "Americans found circumcision appealing not merely on medical grounds, but also for its connotations of science, health, and cleanliness—newly important class distinctions" in a country where 17 million immigrants arrived between 1890 and 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gollaher|2001|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of [[World War II]], Britain moved to a [[publicly funded health care|nationalized health care]] system, and so looked to ensure that each medical procedure covered by the new system was cost-effective and the procedure for non-medical reasons was not covered by the national healthcare system. [[Douglas Gairdner]]'s 1949 article "The Fate of the Foreskin" argued that the evidence available at that time showed that the risks outweighed the known benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gairdner D |title=The fate of the foreskin: a study of circumcision |journal=Br Med J |date=1949 |volume=2 |issue=4642 |pages=1433–7 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2051968/pdf/brmedj03656-0009.pdf |doi=10.1136/bmj.2.4642.1433 |pmid=15408299 |pmc=2051968 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910235814/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2051968/pdf/brmedj03656-0009.pdf |archivedate=2017-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Circumcision rates dropped in Britain and in the rest of Europe. In the 1970s, national medical associations in Australia and Canada issued recommendations against routine infant circumcision, leading to drops in the rates of both of those countries. The United States made similar statements in the 1970s, but stopped short of recommending against it—simply stating that it has no medical benefit. Since then they have amended their policy statements several times with the current recommendation being that the benefits outweigh the risks, but they do not recommend it routinely.&lt;ref name=alanis_2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=gollaher_2001_ch4/&gt;

An association between circumcision and reduced heterosexual HIV infection rates was suggested in 1986.&lt;ref name=alanis_2004/&gt;  Experimental evidence was needed to establish a causal relationship, so three [[randomized controlled trial]]s were commissioned as a means to reduce the effect of any [[confounding|confounding factors]].&lt;ref name=siegfried_Cochrane_2009/&gt; Trials took place in South Africa, [[Kenya]] and [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name=siegfried_Cochrane_2009/&gt; All three trials were stopped early by their monitoring boards on ethical grounds because those in the circumcised group had a lower rate of HIV contraction than the control group.&lt;ref name=siegfried_Cochrane_2009/&gt; Subsequently, the World Health Organization promoted circumcision in high-risk populations as part of an overall program to reduce the spread of HIV,&lt;ref name=WHO_HIV_2007/&gt; although some have challenged the validity of the African randomized controlled trials, prompting a number of researchers to question the effectiveness of circumcision as an HIV prevention strategy.&lt;ref name=boyle_hill_2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=dowsett_2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=darby_2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=frisch_2013/&gt; The Male Circumcision Clearinghouse website was formed in 2009 by WHO, UNAIDS, FHI and AVAC to provide current evidence-based guidance, information, and resources to support the delivery of safe male circumcision services in countries that choose to scale up the procedure as one component of comprehensive HIV prevention services.&lt;ref name=NYTimes_2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=AVAC_2015/&gt;

In some cultures, males are generally required to be circumcised shortly after birth, during childhood or around puberty as part of a rite of passage. Circumcision is commonly practiced in the Jewish and Islamic faiths.&lt;!-- the references for this, found in the following sections, are:  &lt;ref name=alsabbagh_1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bolnick_2012_ch23/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bolnick_2012_ch24/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bolnick_2012_ch26/&gt;&lt;ref name=clark_2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Columbia_encyc_2011_circ/&gt;&lt;ref name=encyc_religion_2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=glass_1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=riggs_2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO_2007_GTDPSA/&gt; !--&gt;

====Judaism====
{{main|Brit milah}}
[[File:Covenant of Abraham.JPG|thumb|Preparing for a Jewish ritual circumcision with a Mogen shield (on the table, next to the scalpel)]]
Circumcision is very important to most branches of [[Judaism]], with over 90% of male adherents having the procedure performed as a religious obligation.  The basis for its observance is found in the [[Torah]] of the Hebrew Bible, in Genesis chapter 17, in which a covenant of circumcision is made with Abraham and his descendants. Jewish circumcision is part of the ''[[brit milah]]'' ritual, to be performed by a specialist ritual circumciser (a ''[[mohel]]'') on the eighth day of a newborn son's life (with certain exceptions for poor health). Jewish law requires that the circumcision leaves the glans bare when the penis is flaccid.  Converts to Conservative and Orthodox Judaism must also be circumcised; those who are already circumcised undergo a symbolic circumcision ritual. Circumcision is not required by Judaism for one to be considered Jewish, but some adherents foresee serious negative spiritual consequences if it is neglected.&lt;ref name=glass_1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bolnick_2012_ch23/&gt;

According to traditional Jewish law, in the absence of a grown free Jewish male expert, a woman, a slave, or a child, that has the required skills, is also authorized to perform the circumcision, provided that she or he is Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud Avodah Zarah 26b; Menachot 42a; Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, Milah, ii. 1; [[Shulkhan Arukh]], Yoreh De'ah, l.c.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most streams of non-Orthodox Judaism allow female mohels, called ''mohalot'' ({{lang-he|מוֹהֲלוֹת}}, the plural of {{lang|he|מוֹהֶלֶת}} ''mohelet'', feminine of ''mohel''), without restriction. In 1984, Deborah Cohen became the first certified Reform mohelet; she was certified by the Berit Mila program of Reform Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131007073323/http://beritmila.org/ Berit Mila Program of Reform Judaism] Retrieved 2 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is some debate within Islam over whether it is a religious requirement, circumcision (called ''khitan'') is practiced nearly universally by Muslim males. Islam bases its practice of circumcision on the Genesis 17 narrative, the same Biblical chapter referred to by Jews. The procedure is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, however, it is a tradition established by Islam's prophet [[Muhammad]] directly (following Abraham), and so its practice is considered a ''[[sunnah]]'' (prophet's tradition) and is very important in Islam. For Muslims, circumcision is also a matter of cleanliness, purification and control over one's baser self (''[[nafs]]''). There is no agreement across the many Islamic communities about the age at which circumcision should be performed. It may be done from soon after birth up to about age 15; most often it is performed at around six to seven years of age. The timing can correspond with the boy's completion of his recitation of the whole Quran, with a coming-of-age event such as taking on the responsibility of daily prayer or betrothal. Circumcision may be celebrated with an associated family or community event. Circumcision is recommended for, but is not required of, converts to Islam.&lt;ref name=clark_2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=alsabbagh_1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bolnick_2012_ch24/&gt;

====Christianity====

The [[New Testament]] chapter [[Council of Jerusalem|Acts 15]] records that Christianity did not require circumcision.

====African cultures====
Certain African cultural groups, such as the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] of Nigeria, customarily circumcise their infant sons. The procedure is also practiced by some cultural groups or individual family lines in the [[Sudan]], [[Zaire]]&lt;!--Is this meant to say Zaire or the modern day state of the DR Congo?--&gt;, [[Uganda]] and in southern Africa. For some of these groups, circumcision appears to be purely cultural, done with no particular religious significance or intention to distinguish members of a group. For others, circumcision might be done for purification, or it may be interpreted as a mark of subjugation. Among these groups, even when circumcision is done for reasons of tradition, it is often done in hospitals.&lt;ref name=encyc_religion_2005/&gt; The [[Maasai people]] who live predominantly in [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]], use circumcision as a rite of passage. It's also used for distinguished age groups. This is usually done after every fifteen years where a new "age set" are formed. The new members are to undergo initiation at the same time. Whenever new age groups are initiated, they will become novice warriors and replace the previous group. The new initiates will be given a unique name that will be an important marker of the history of the Maasai. No [[anesthesia]] is used and initiates have to endure the pain or else young boy will be called flinchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L9tRAQAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=The Maasai of Matapato: A Study of Rituals of Rebellion|last=Spencer|first=Paul|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=c. 1988|isbn=9780719025549|location=London|pages=Chapter 5|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fengu people|Xhosa]] community practice circumcision as a sacrifice.

====Australian cultures====
Some Australian Aborigines use circumcision as a test of bravery and self-control as a part of a rite of passage into manhood, which results in full societal and ceremonial membership.  It may be accompanied by body [[scarification]] and the removal of teeth, and may be followed later by [[penile subincision]].  Circumcision is one of many trials and ceremonies required before a youth is considered to have become knowledgeable enough to maintain and pass on the cultural traditions.  During these trials, the maturing youth bonds in solidarity with the men.  Circumcision is also strongly associated with a man's family, and it is part of the process required to prepare a man to take a wife and produce his own family.&lt;ref name=encyc_religion_2005/&gt;

===Ethical and legal issues===
{{Main|Ethics of circumcision}}
{{See also|Circumcision controversies|Circumcision and law}}

[[File:Activist protesting infant circumcision.jpg|thumb|A protest against infant circumcision]]

There is a long-running and vigorous debate over ethical concerns regarding circumcision, particularly neonatal circumcision for reasons other than intended direct medical benefit. There are three parties involved in the decision to circumcise a minor: the minor as the patient, the parents (or other guardians) and the physician.  The physician is bound under the ethical principles of [[beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]] (promoting well-being) and [[primum non nocere|non-maleficence]] ("first, do no harm"), and so is charged with the responsibility to promote the best interests of the patient while minimizing unnecessary harms. Those involved must weigh the factors of what is in the best interest of the minor against the potential harms of the procedure.&lt;ref name="caga-anan_2011"/&gt;

With a newborn involved, the decision is made more complex due to the principles of respect for autonomy and consent, as a newborn cannot understand or engage in a logical discussion of his own values and best interests.&lt;ref name=pinto_2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="caga-anan_2011"/&gt;  A mentally more mature child can understand the issues involved to some degree, and the physician and parents may elicit input from the child and weigh it appropriately in the decision-making process, although the law may not treat such input as legally informative. Ethicists and legal theorists also state that it is questionable for parents to make a decision for the child that precludes the child from making a different decision for himself later. Such a question can be raised for the decision by the parents either to circumcise or not to circumcise the child.&lt;ref name="caga-anan_2011"/&gt;

Generally, circumcision on a minor is not ethically controversial or legally questionable when there is a clear and pressing medical indication for which it is the accepted best practice to resolve. Where circumcision is the chosen intervention, the physician has an ethical responsibility to ensure the procedure is performed competently and safely to minimize potential harms.&lt;ref name=pinto_2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="caga-anan_2011"/&gt; Worldwide, most legal jurisdictions do not have specific laws concerning the circumcision of males,&lt;ref name=WHO_2007_GTDPSA/&gt; but infant circumcision is considered legal under the existing laws in countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;ref name=RACP_2010/&gt; A few countries have passed legislation on the procedure:  Germany allows non-therapeutic circumcision,&lt;ref name=DW_2012/&gt; while non-religious routine circumcision is illegal in South Africa and Sweden.&lt;ref name=WHO_2007_GTDPSA/&gt;&lt;ref name=RACP_2010/&gt;

Throughout society, circumcision is often considered for reasons other than medical need. Public health advocates of circumcision consider it to have a net benefit, and therefore feel that increasing the circumcision rate is an ethical imperative. They recommend performing the procedure during the neonatal period when it is less expensive and has a lower risk of complications.&lt;ref name=pinto_2012/&gt; While studies show there is a modest [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] benefit to circumcision, critics argue that the number of circumcisions that would have to be performed would yield an overall negative public health outcome due to the resulting number of complications or other negative effects (such as pain). Pinto (2012) writes "sober proponents and detractors of circumcision agree that there is no overwhelming medical evidence to support either side."&lt;ref name=pinto_2012/&gt; This type of cost-benefit analysis is highly dependent on the kinds and frequencies of health problems in the population under discussion and how circumcision affects those health problems.&lt;ref name="caga-anan_2011"/&gt;

Parents are assumed to have the child's best interests in mind. Ethically, it is imperative that the medical practitioner inform the parents about the benefits and risks of the procedure and obtain informed consent before performing it. Practically, however, many parents come to a decision about circumcising the child before he is born, and a discussion of the benefits and risks of the procedure with a physician has not been shown to have a significant effect on the decision. Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents' desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and harms) such non-medical factors in determining the child's best interests and may ethically perform the procedure. Equally, without a clear medical benefit relative to the potential harms, a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute enough as benefits to outweigh the potential harms and refuse to perform the procedure. Medical organization such as the [[British Medical Association]] state that their member physicians are not obliged to perform the procedure in such situations.&lt;ref name=pinto_2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="caga-anan_2011"/&gt;

In 2012 the International NGO Council on Violence against Children identified non-theraputic circumcision of infants and boys, as being among harmful practices that constitute violence against children and violate their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crin.org/en/docs/InCo_Report_15Oct.pdf#page=21|title=VIOLATING CHILDREN'S RIGHTS: Harmful practices based on tradition, culture, religion or superstition|last=|first=|date=October 2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German Academy for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine (Deutsche Akademie für Kinder- und Jugendmedizin e.V., DAKJ) recommend against routine non-medical infant circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stellungnahme zur Beschneidung von minderjährigen Jungen|url=http://dakj.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2012_Stellungnahme_Beschneidung.pdf|website=dakj.de|accessdate=11 March 2017|date=25 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312063250/http://dakj.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2012_Stellungnahme_Beschneidung.pdf|archivedate=12 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Dutch Medical Association questions why the ethics regarding male genital alterations should be viewed any differently from female genital alterations.&lt;ref name="knmg.nl"/&gt;

===Economic considerations===
The cost-effectiveness of circumcision has been studied to determine whether a policy of circumcising all newborns or a policy of promoting and providing inexpensive or free access to circumcision for all adult men who choose it would result in lower overall societal healthcare costs.  As [[HIV/AIDS]] is an incurable disease that is expensive to manage, significant effort has been spent studying the cost-effectiveness of circumcision to reduce its spread in parts of Africa that have a relatively high infection rate and low circumcision prevalence.&lt;ref name=doyle_2010/&gt; Several analyses have concluded that circumcision programs for adult men in Africa are cost-effective and in some cases are cost-saving.&lt;ref name=uthman_2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grimes|first1=Caris E.|last2=Henry|first2=Jaymie Ang|last3=Maraka|first3=Jane|last4=Mkandawire|first4=Nyengo C.|last5=Cotton|first5=Michael|title=Cost-effectiveness of Surgery in Low- and Middle-income Countries: A Systematic Review|journal=World Journal of Surgery|date=8 October 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=252–263|doi=10.1007/s00268-013-2243-y|pmid=24101020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rwanda, circumcision has been found to be cost-effective across a wide range of age groups from newborn to adult,&lt;ref name=albero_2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=binagwaho_2010/&gt; with the greatest savings achieved when the procedure is performed in the newborn period due to the lower cost per procedure and greater timeframe for HIV infection protection.&lt;ref name=kim_2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=binagwaho_2010/&gt; Circumcision for the prevention of HIV transmission in adults has also been found to be cost-effective in South Africa, Kenya, and Uganda, with cost savings estimated in the billions of US dollars over 20 years.&lt;ref name=doyle_2010/&gt;  Hankins ''et al.'' (2011) estimated that a $1.5 billion investment in circumcision for adults in 13 high-priority African countries would yield $16.5 billion in savings.&lt;ref name=hankins_2011/&gt;

The overall cost-effectiveness of neonatal circumcision has also been studied in the United States, which has a different cost setting from Africa in areas such as public health infrastructure, availability of medications, and medical technology and the willingness to use it.&lt;ref name=xu_2009/&gt;  A study by the CDC suggests that newborn circumcision would be societally cost-effective in the United States based on circumcision's efficacy against the heterosexual transmission of HIV alone, without considering any other cost benefits.&lt;ref name=AAP_2012/&gt;  The American Academy of Pediatrics (2012) recommends that neonatal circumcision in the United States be covered by third-party payers such as [[Medicaid]] and insurance.&lt;ref name=AAP_2012/&gt; A 2014 review that considered reported benefits of circumcision such as reduced risks from HIV, HPV, and HSV-2 stated that circumcision is cost-effective in both the United States and Africa and may result in health care savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tobian|first1=AA|last2=Kacker|first2=S|last3=Quinn|first3=TC|title=Male circumcision: a globally relevant but under-utilized method for the prevention of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections|journal=Annual Review of Medicine|date=2014|volume=65|pages=293–306|pmid=24111891|doi=10.1146/annurev-med-092412-090539|pmc=4539243}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a 2014 literature review found that there are significant gaps in the current literature on male and female sexual health that need to be addressed for the literature to be applicable to North American populations.&lt;ref name = bossio_2014/&gt;

{{canon law}}
A '''consultor''' is one who gives counsel, i.e., a counselor.

In the [[Catholic Church]], it is a specific title for various advisory positions:
*in the [[Roman Curia]], a consultor is a specially appointed expert who may be called upon for advice desired by a department. Consultors, who can be members of the [[clergy]], female or male [[religious]], or [[laity]], and possibly even non-Catholics, are called upon according to need and according to their competence in specific fields. The decisions are then made by the cardinals and (since the Second Vatican Council) bishops who are members of the department, those of the greatest importance being made at plenary meetings, held in principle every year, at which even those members not resident in Rome take part, while those that are important but of ordinary character are taken at the more frequent ordinary meetings, and the day-to-day routine work is done by the prefect or president of the department, assisted by the secretary and under-secretary and the other members of the staff.
*in a [[diocese]], the college of consultors consists of [[priest]]s charged with advising the [[bishop]]; some decisions require that they be given a hearing, others require their consent; when a ''[[sede vacante]]'' situation arises, the college of consultors is obliged to elect a [[diocesan administrator]] within eight days of receiving notice of the vacancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1H.HTM canon 421 of the Code of Canon Law] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102092325/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1H.HTM |date=January 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*in certain regular congregations (i.e. [[religious order]]s) consultors can advise the [[superior-general]],  (e.g. the six geographically diverse consultors to the superior general of the [[Passionist]]s), [[provincial superior]] (e.g. [[Redemptorist]] Vice-provincials), or a local superior.

      <comment>since the lead was not citing a source and seems a bit confusing, I rewrote it with two sources about that "dervish" is commonly held in classical Islamic literature (such as performing miracles). I didn't know about dervishes leading Tariqa. further a dervish is not necessarily part of an order (just like the first source states). Further they are not always "poor". dervishes of cervish orders often had political positions and earned money by advising the Sultan.</comment>

==Etymology==
{{Sufism}}{{Sunni Islam}}
[[File:A Pakistani Punjabi Dervish.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A [[Pakistan]]i Dervish at [[Tulamba]] (May 2008).]]

The Persian word ''darvīsh'' ({{lang|fa|درویش}}) is of ancient origin and descends from a [[Proto-Iranian]] word that appears in [[Avestan]] as {{nobreak|''drigu-'',}} "needy, [[mendicant]]", via Middle Persian ''driyosh.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/darvis |title=Encyclopædia Iranica &amp;#124; Articles |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranian word is probably a [[cognate]] with the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] word {{nobreak|''adhrigu-'',}} an [[epithet]] of uncertain meaning applied to several deities. The Vedic word is probably to be analysed as {{nobreak|''a-dhrigu-'',}} that is "not {{nobreak|''dhrigu-'',"}} perhaps "not poor", i.e., "rich." The existence of this Vedic cognate suggests that the institution of the holy mendicant was as prominent among the ancient [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] people as it has been historically in later Iran in the form of dervish brotherhoods, and also in India in the form of the various schools of [[sannyasi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go2081/is_2_122/ai_n7042986/?tag=content;col1 | work=The Journal of the American Oriental Society | title=Adhrigu and drigu: on the semantics of an old Indo-Iranian word | first=George | last=Thompson | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because the etymology of the word is not apparent from the point of view of the modern Persian language, there have been attempts to make the parts of the word interpretable in terms of contemporary words and with reference to Sufic mystical concepts. ''Der'', spelt as ''dar'' before 1964 ([[Dari language]]), means "door" in [[Persian language|Persian]]; ''dervish'' has been interpreted as "one who goes from door to door".&lt;ref name=islam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelus á S. Joseph: Gazophylacium linguae Persarum, triplici linguarum clavi, Italicae, Latinae  […] [https://books.google.com/books?id=-CIBwuRw0AEC&amp;pg=PA297], Amsterdam, 1684, Pg 6, 199&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian word also gives terms for "ascetic" in some languages, as in the [[Urdu]] phrase ''darveshaneh tabi'at'', "an unflappable or ascetic temperament". According to the [[Bundahishn]] ''dervish'' or ''darwesh'' means "visitor from many doors". The term is a composition of the word ''der'' or ''dar'' and the adjective ''wish'' or ''wesh'' ويش or وش ''vsh'' (much, more), and means "someone who goes from door to door and sings, gets money, and wakes the people". This word is outdated in Persian, but it exists in the Indo-Iranian language of [[Pashto]] as ''wesh zalmanyan'' or ''wish zalmayan'', meaning "awakened youth".&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Justi:Der Bundeshesh, zum ersten Male, herausgegeben, transcribiert, übersetzt und mit Clossar versehen, Leipzig,1868 [https://archive.org/stream/derbundeheshher00unkngoog#page/n9/mode/1up], Pg. 139, 262, 266&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious practice==
[[File:Preziosi - Derviş cerşetor.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A dervish.]]
Many dervishes are mendicant ascetics who have taken a vow of poverty, unlike [[mullah]]s. The main reason they beg is to learn humility, but dervishes are prohibited to beg for their own good. They have to give the collected money to other poor people. Others work in common professions; Egyptian [[Qadiriyya]] – known in Turkey as Kadiri – are fishermen, for example.

Some classical writers indicate that the poverty of the dervish is not merely economic. [[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]], for instance, who himself travelled widely as a dervish, and wrote extensively about them, says in his ''[[Gulistan of Sa'di|Gulistan]]'':
{{Quotation|Of what avail is frock, or rosary,
Or clouted garment? Keep thyself but free&lt;br&gt;
From evil deeds, it will not need for thee&lt;br&gt;
To wear the cap of felt: a darwesh be&lt;br&gt;
In heart, and wear the cap of Tartary.&lt;ref&gt;chapter 2 story 16: [https://archive.org/stream/gulistnorrosega00eastgoog/gulistnorrosega00eastgoog_djvu.txt "The Gulistān; or, Rose-garden, of Shek̲h̲ Muslihu'd-dīn Sādī of Shīrāz, translated for the first time into prose and verse, with an introductory preface, and a life of the author, from the Ātish Kadah"] a story later adapted by La Fontaine for his tale 'Le songe d'un habitant du Mogol'&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Rumi]] writes in Book 1 of his [[Masnavi]]:&lt;ref&gt;''The Masnavi: Book One'', translated by Jawid Mojaddedi, Oxford World's Classics Series, Oxford University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-19-955231-3}}, p63.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|Water that's poured inside will sink the boat&lt;br&gt;

==Whirling dervishes==
{{Main|Sufi whirling}}
[[File:Whriling dervishes, Rumi Fest 2007.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Whirling dervishes]], Rumi Fest 2007]]
The whirling dance or [[Sufi whirling]] that is proverbially associated with dervishes is best known in the West by the practices (performances) of the [[Mevlevi]] order in Turkey, and is part of a formal ceremony known as the [[Sama (Sufism)|Sama]]. It is, however, also practiced by other orders. The Sama is only one of the many Sufi ceremonies performed to try to reach [[religious ecstasy]] (''majdhb'', ''fana''). The name ''Mevlevi'' comes from the [[Persian language|Persian]] poet [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]], who was a dervish himself. This practice, though not intended as entertainment, has become a tourist attraction in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koentges|first=Chris|title=13 Things The Whirling Dervishes Can Teach You About Spinning Until You’re Dizzy Enough To Puke|url=http://veryethnic.wordpress.com/2012/06/29/13-things-the-whirling-dervishes-can-teach-you-about-spinning-until-youre-dizzy-enough-to-puke/|publisher=The Very Ethnic Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.

==Orders==
[[File:Turkey.Konya050.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Dervish mannequins (Mevlâna mausoleum, [[Konya, Turkey]])]]
There are various orders of dervishes, almost all of which trace their origins from various Muslim saints and teachers, especially [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|Imam Ali]]. Various orders and suborders have appeared and disappeared over the centuries. Dervishes spread into [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], [[Turkey]], the [[Balkans]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Tajikistan]].

Other dervish groups include the [[Bektashi]]s, who are connected to the [[Janissary|janissaries]], and the [[Senussi]], who are rather orthodox in their beliefs. Other fraternities and subgroups chant verses of the [[Qur'an]], play drums or [[Sema|whirl]] in groups, all according to their specific traditions. They practice [[meditation]], as is the case with most of the Sufi orders in [[South Asia]], many of whom owe allegiance to, or were influenced by, the [[Chishti]] order. Each [[fraternity]] uses its own garb and methods of acceptance and initiation, some of which may be rather severe.

==Somali Dervish movement==
{{main|Dervish movement (Somali)}}
The [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish movement]] was an early 20th-century [[Somalis|Somali]] [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Islamic state]] that was established by [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]], a religious leader who gathered Somali soldiers from across the [[Horn of Africa]] and united them into a loyal army known as the ''Dervishes''. This Dervish army enabled Hassan to carve out a powerful state through conquest of lands claimed by the Somali [[Sultan]]s, the [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]] and the [[Europe]]an powers. The Dervish movement acquired renown in the [[Islamic world|Islamic]] and [[West world|Western]] worlds due to its resistance against [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Italy]]. The Dervish movement successfully repulsed British-led Somali and Ethiopian forces four times and forced them to retreat to the coastal region.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of African history - Page 1406&lt;/ref&gt; The polity also maintained relations with other authorities, receiving support from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[German empire]]s. The [[Turkish people|Turks]] also named Hassan [[Emir]] of the Somali nation,&lt;ref&gt;I.M. Lewis, ''The modern history of Somaliland: from nation to state'', (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson: 1965), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[German people|Germans]] promised to officially recognize any territories the Dervishes were to acquire.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Ofcansky, Historical dictionary of Ethiopia, (The Scarecrow Press, Inc.: 2004), p.405&lt;/ref&gt; The Dervish movement was finally [[Somaliland campaign (1920)|defeated by the British in 1920]].

==Other historical uses==

===Mahdists===
Various western historical writers have sometimes used the term ''dervish'' rather loosely, linking it to, among other things, the [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdist uprising]] in [[Sudan]] and other rebellions against [[colonialism|colonial]] powers. In such cases, the term "dervishes" may have been used as a generic (and often pejorative) term for the opposing Islamic entity and all members of its military, political and religious institutions, including persons who would not be considered "dervishes" in the strict sense.

For example, a contemporary British drawing of the fighting in Sudan was entitled "The defeat of the dervishes at Toski" (see [[History of Sudan (1884–1898)#British response]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5605">'''Frederic Spiegelberg''' (May 24, 1897 – November 10, 1994) was a [[Stanford University]] professor of Asian religions. 

==Education and career==
Spiegelberg was born into a [[Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Leland, ''Rainbow Body: A History of the Western Chakra System from Blavatsky to Brennan'', Nicolas-Hays (2016), p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; in Hamburg, Germany, in 1897 and earned his doctorate at the [[University of Tübingen]] in 1922. He went on to earn a theological degree from the German Lutheran Church. He studied with theologians [[Rudolf Otto]] and [[Paul Tillich]], the philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], and the psychologist [[Carl Jung]]. He participated in Jung's [[Eranos]] [[Academic conference|symposia]] and lectured at Jung's institute in [[Zurich]]. In 1933, Spiegelberg took over Tillich's position at the University of Dresden, but only four years later he was fired from his position and he and his wife, Rosalie, fled Hitler¹s Germany with the aid of Tillich.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/pr/94/941115Arc4042.html "Comparative Religions Expert Frederic Spiegelberg Dies at 97"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, Spiegelberg taught at Columbia University, the University of Rochester, the University of California, Union Theological Seminary and the Pacific School of Religion.
He joined Stanford as a lecturer in religion in 1941 and retired in 1962 as professor of Indian civilization in the Department of Asiatic and Slavic Studies. He became an expert in Asian religions with a classical comparative focus. He was known for his command of languages, including Sanskrit, Pali, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, German and French. He was considered an exceptional lecturer, winning student awards and the admiration of peers.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;

In 1950, Spiegelberg invited Indian professor of philosophy [[Haridas Chaudhuri]], who had done his dissertation on the Integral philosophy of [[Sri Aurobindo]], to join the staff of the newly formed [[American Academy of Asian Studies]] in [[San Francisco]], the first accredited U.S. graduate school devoted exclusively to the study of Asiatic lands and peoples. This school was closed and replaced in 1968 by the California Institute of Asian (now Integral) Studies founded by Haridas Chaudhuri where Spiegelberg served as president from 1976 to 1978. In 1960, Spiegelberg and Chaudhuri published a commemorative volume on Sri Aurobindo.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, Haridas, and Frederic Spiegelberg, eds. ''The Integral Philosophy of Sri Aurobindo: A Commemorative Symposium''. Allen &amp; Unwin, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiegelberg was also involved in founding the [[Esalen Institute]] with former student [[Michael Murphy (author)|Michael Murphy]] and [[Dick Price]].

In 2007, religion scholar [[Jeffrey Kripal]] summarized Spiegelberg's approach to religion as follows: 
:Spiegelberg’s phrase "the religion of no religion" had deep existential roots. It was based on a mystical encounter with the natural world he experienced as a young theology student. He was walking in a wheat field on a bright day when, quite suddenly, his ego vanished and what he calls the Self appeared. Through this altered perspective, he began to see that God was shining through everything in the world, that everything was divine, that there was nothing but holiness. As he reveled in this revelation, he came around a corner and found himself confronting a gray church. He was horrified. How, he asked himself, could such a building claim to hold something more sacred, more divine, than what he had just experienced in the poppies, birds, and sky of the now divinized cosmos? It all seemed preposterous, utterly preposterous, to him. From the theological scandal of this initial altered state, Spiegelberg developed and theorized what was essentially (or non-essentially) an [[Apophatic theology|apophatic]] [[mystical theology]] that approaches religious language, symbol, and myth as non-literal projective expressions of some deeper metaphysical truth that, paradoxically, is simultaneously [[immanent]] and [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]]—a kind of [[dialectical]] or [[mystical humanism]], if you will. It was just such a comparative mystical theology grounded in the natural world, and just such a critical but deep engagement with the religious traditions of the world, that inspired Murphy and his colleagues in their new venture.&lt;ref&gt;Kripal, Jeffrey. [https://divinity.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/imce/pdfs/webforum/042007/esalen.pdf From Altered States to Altered Categories (and Back Again): Academic Method and the Human Potential Movement"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiegelberg died in 1994 of complications from abdominal surgery. He was survived by a daughter, Corinne Wilkinson, as well as two children from an earlier marriage: a son, Valentin Spiegelberg, and a daughter, Dorothea Florian.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt;

'''''Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America''''' is a 2016 non-fiction book by rock journalist Jesse Jarnow. The book describes American psychedelics counterculture in the second half of the twentieth century.

== Background ==
Jarnow is a rock journalist whose writing has been published by [[Rolling Stone]], [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]], [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]], and the [[Village Voice]]. He began his career writing about the Grateful Dead for ''Dupree's Diamond News.'' Jarnow spent nearly a decade researching ''Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America''. Some of the book's material was published in earlier articles for magazines like [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] and [[Relix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Jarnow|first1=Jesse|title=Call Them Hippies, But the Grateful Dead Were Tech Pioneers|magazine=Wired|date=July 3, 2015|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/07/grateful-dead-fare-thee-well-tech-pioneers/|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Jarnow|first1=Jesse|title=Everyone Knew Him as Nancy: Richard Wright and the Old, Weird Phish|magazine=Relix|date=August 15, 2012|url=http://www.relix.com/articles/detail/everyone-knew-him-as-nancy-richard-wright-and-the-old-weird-phish|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

''Heads'' offers an analysis of American psychedelic [[counterculture]] and its effects on mainstream American society. Jarnow describes the [[Grateful Dead]] and their concerts as a kind of loosely organized infrastructure for American counterculture, detailing how the band and their fans were inextricably linked to LSD distribution from the 1960s through the 1990s.

In addition to the Grateful Dead's longstanding connection LSD chemist and sound engineer [[Owsley Stanley]], Jarnow describes how Grateful Dead concerts served as a meeting point and social network for high level LSD dealers like Karen Horning and chemists like Sarah Matzer and [[William Leonard Pickard]]. The book also discusses how the U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] targeted LSD-trafficking Deadheads in the 1980s and 1990s.

The book also examines the influence of LSD and other psychedelics on diverse fields of American culture, especially technology and [[Silicon Valley]]. Jarnow describes the psychedelic use of [[Apple Computers]] founders [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Steve Wozniak]], and how early Internet technology like [[ARPANET]] was used for countercultural purposes.

''Heads'' also examines how LSD and the Grateful Dead impacted the art world, influencing the New York [[graffiti]] clique Rolling Thunder Writers and artist [[Keith Haring]]. Jarnow reports that Keith Haring's first commercially available work was a T-shirt Haring designed to sell in the parking lot of Grateful Dead shows.

''Heads'' also offers a history of the Grateful Dead's fans, known as [[Deadhead]]s. The book presents biographic information about the band's archivist Dick Latvala, the network of Grateful Dead tape trading, and the history of concert promoter Johnny Dwork and the Hampshire College Grateful Dead Historical Society.

In its attempt to cover a range of central narrative within American counterculture and the [[hippie]] scene, the book presents histories of the [[Bread and Puppet Theater]], the American jamband [[Phish]], [[Wetlands Preserve]], [[John Perry Barlow]] and the [[Electronic Freedom Foundation]], psychedelic pioneer [[Terence McKenna]], and Humbead's Revised Map of the World.

== Reception ==
''Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America'' received significant mainstream coverage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Dolan |first=John |date=April 11, 2016 |title=America's Psychedelic Majority: How LSD Changed Culture Forever|magazine=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Book Explores How LSD Changed Culture and the Psychedelic Majority|url=http://www.msn.com/en-ca/video/news/new-book-explores-how-lsd-changed-culture-and-the-psychedelic-majority/vp-BBrCTYx|website=MSN|accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and generally favorable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Hua |first=Hsu |date=May 17, 2016 |title=The Lingering Legacy of Psychedelia|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-lingering-legacy-of-psychedelia|journal=The New Yorker|access-date=May 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silberman|first1=Steve|title=‘Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America,’ by Jesse Jarnow|url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Heads-A-Biography-of-Psychedelic-America-7220731.php|publisher=SFgate.com|date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Paul |first=John |date=March 7, 2016 |title='Heads' Traverses the Intracranial Landscape of Minds Set Loose By Myriad Chemical Compounds|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/heads-a-biography-of-psychedelic-america-by-jesse-jarnow/|magazine=PopMatters|access-date=May 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hua Hsu]] of [[The New Yorker]] described the book as "meticulously researched" and praised Jarnow for his "attempt to complicate and extend the history of psychoactive drugs in this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hua |first=Hsu |date=May 17, 2016 |title=The Lingering Legacy of Psychedelia|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-lingering-legacy-of-psychedelia|journal=The New Yorker|access-date=May 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for SFGate, [[Steve Silberman]] praised the book for its novel approach to psychedelic counterculture: "rather than giving more screen time to overhyped blowhards such as [Timothy] Leary, Jarnow refreshingly focuses on the overlooked foot-soldiers of the lysergic revolution." Silberman described "most regrettable oversight" as "Jarnow’s failure to explore the Afrofuturist movement and other aspects of non-white psychedelia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silberman|first1=Steve|title=‘Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America,’ by Jesse Jarnow|url=http://www.sfgate.com/books/article/Heads-A-Biography-of-Psychedelic-America-7220731.php|publisher=SFgate.com|date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kirkus Reviews]] commended book's depth of research: "Jarnow has a bloodhound’s sense of the marrow of an argument and the meat of historic fact." Kirkus questioned some of Jarnow's conclusions about the influence of psychedelic culture, while reiterating the book's writing style and entertaining history: "Though Jarnow is sometimes unduly celebratory and sometimes begs credulity—is the fact that we use emoji on our mobile phones really evidence that the psychedelic revolution carried the day?—his book is a lot of fun to read, and it absorbs its own weight in excess reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America|url=

In [[Etruscan religion]], '''Hercle''' (also ''Heracle'' or ''Hercl''), the son of [[Tinia]] and [[Uni (mythology)|Uni]], was a version of the Greek [[Heracles]], depicted as a muscular figure often carrying a club and wearing a lionskin. He is a popular subject in [[Etruscan art]], particularly [[bronze mirror]]s, which show him engaged in adventures not known from the [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] of Heracles or the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] and later [[classical mythology|classical myths]] of [[Hercules]].&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Thomson de Grummond, ''Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend'' (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, 2006), pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Etruscan tradition, [[Uni (mythology)|Uni]] (Roman [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]) grants Hercle access to a life among the immortals by offering her breast milk to him.&lt;ref&gt;De Grummond, ''Etruscan Myth'', pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Hercle was the first man elevated to a godhood through his deeds and Etruscan aristocrats tried to identify with this ascension, as reflected in artwork and literature.

==Scenes from Etruscan art==
Hercle can be recognized in Etruscan art from his attributes, or is sometimes identified by name. Since [[Liber Linteus|Etruscan literature]] has not survived, the meaning of the scenes in which he appears can only be interpreted by comparison to Greek and Roman myths, through information about Etruscan myths preserved by Greek and Latin literature, or through conjectural reconstructions based on other Etruscan representations.

* Hercle, depicted as a nude youth and carrying his club, presents the winged baby Epeur to Tinia, as [[Turan (mythology)|Turan]] (left) and [[Thalna]] (right) look on.&lt;ref&gt;De Grummond, ''Etruscan Myth'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hillel Roman''' (הלל רומן) is a visual artist living and working in Tel Aviv, Israel.

==Biography==

Roman was born on April 16, 1975 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. At age 24 he joined [[HaMidrasha – Faculty of the Arts|Hamidrasha Art School]], [[Beit Berl College]], [[Israel]]. In 2004 Roman graduated from [[Tel-Aviv University]], the Department for [[Poetics]] and [[Comparative Literature]] ([[magna cum laude]]), and in 2007 he received his [[Masters of Fine Arts]] from [[Goldsmiths College]], [[University of London]].

Roman employs a wide range of techniques, from [[drawing]], [[painting]] and [[conceptual art]], through [[sculpting]] and [[etching]], to building fully functional astronomical observatories. 

After his graduation from Beit Berl college, he assumed a teaching position there, and in the years 2004-2006 he lectured at [[Avni Institute of Art and Design]] in [[Tel Aviv]]. After having returned from his studies in London, he resumed his position at Beit Berl, and also accepted a teaching role at '''Thelma Yellin''' school of Fine Arts.

In 2007, Roman received a residency grant at [[Cité Internationale Universitaire de Paris|Cite Internationale des Arts]], [[Paris]], [[France]]. In 2009, he won the Young Artist Prize from the [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Ministry of culture]], Israel. The judging committee said about him: "Roman's paintings, drawings and etchings, always beautiful and saturated... more than intending to delegate a (renewed) birth of beauty out of the banal, replicated and ordinary, they wish to confront the postmodern spectator with the question 'what is modern painting'..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcs.gov.il/Units/Culture/%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%96%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D+%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%AA+%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8+%D7%90%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%AA/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9D+%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%A0%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A1+%D7%94%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%9F+%D7%94%D7%A6%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%A8+%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%97%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%99+%D7%94%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%94%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%99%D7%AA/youngOman+2009.htm Israel Ministry of culture], Announcing winners of 2009 Young Artists prize&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with curator Orit Bulgaro in the catalog of '''Idiolect''', an exhibition at the Bat Yam Museum of Contemporary Art in 2009, Roman discussed "...the significance of the concrete versus the metaphorical, the human desire to get through the metaphor and to touch, the vain struggle to bridge the distance between the eye and the hand. Maybe that is the privilege of the painter/sculptor, and the source of his relevance, despite it all. In any case, I try to create objects or paintings that exist in that chasm between the concrete and the metaphorical; perhaps that is my way of trying to avoid filling any role."&lt;ref&gt;'''Idiolect''' catalog, Bat Yam Museum of Contemporary Art, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism}}

'''Hwaeom'''  is the name of the [[Korea]]n transmission of the [[Huayan school]] of [[Chinese Buddhism]].

The greatest lasting impact of the Huayan school was to be seen in Korea, where it was transmitted by [[Uisang]] ([[hangul]]:의상대사 625-702), who had been, along with [[Fazang]], a student of [[Zhiyan]]. After Uisang returned to Korea in 671, he worked vigorously toward the establishment of the Hwaeom school on [[Korea]]. In this effort, he was greatly aided by the powerful influences of his friend [[Wonhyo]] ([[hangul]]:원효대사, [[hanja]]:元曉), who although not an official representative of the school, relied deeply on Hwaeom metaphysical principles to establish his concept of interpenetrated Buddhism (通佛教).

After the passing of these two early monks, the Hwaeom school became strongly established under the influence of a long series of Hwaeom masters. The Hwaeom school remained in the position of predominant doctrinal school up until the end of the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty, when it was placed into a forced merger with the [[Korean Buddhism#Seon|Seon]] school ([[hangul]]:선종, [[hanja]]:禪宗). Within the Seon school, Hwaeom thought would continue to play a strong role, and continues as such to modern times.

'''Ilayathu''' ([[IAST]]:'''Ilayat''') (also written as Ilayath, Elayath, Elayathu) is a [[Hindu]] [[community]] in [[Kerala]] and belong to a sect of Brahmin community. The house of an Ilayath is known as Illam. The origin of this community like those of Nampoothiris and Nairs and perhaps most of the upper class communities in Kerala is shrouded in mystery. And what remains is a few legends and traditions.

'''Irreligion''', '''[[atheism]]''' and '''[[agnosticism ]]'''are present among Albanians (see [[religion in Albania]]), along with the predominant faiths of [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name="BogdaniLoughlin2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogdani|first1=Mirela|last2=Loughlin|first2=John|authorlink2=John Loughlin (political scientist)|title=Albania and the European Union: The Tumultuous Journey Towards Integration and Accession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32Wu8H7t8MwC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=16 April 2017|year=2007|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-308-7|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Albanians lead a secular life and reject religious considerations to shape or condition their way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al.undp.org/content/dam/albania/docs/religious%20tolerance%20albania.pdf|title="Religious Tolerance in Albania"|last=|first=|date=|website=|page=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irreligion in Albania arose after a period of rising [[anti-clericalism]] and secularization in the context of the rising [[Albanian nationalism]] in the late [[Ottoman Empire]]. While authors in this period had at times used invective against religion, the first public advocate of abandoning religion itself was [[Ismet Toto]] in 1934&lt;ref name=forToto/&gt; followed by works by Anastas Plasari in 1935.&lt;ref name=forPlasari/&gt; Beginning in 1946 under [[Communist Albania|communist rule in Albania]], religion was first curtailed,&lt;ref name="country-data.com"/&gt; and then public religious practice was outlawed in 1967 with the adoption of [[state atheism]] by [[Enver Hoxha]]&lt;ref name="Tarifa2007"/&gt; although some private practice survived, and remained so until restrictions were first eased in 1985 and then removed in 1990&lt;ref name="revival"/&gt; under his successor [[Ramiz Alia]].&lt;ref name=VickersSurvive/&gt; Polling by UNDP showed that large majorities of Albanians agree that nationalism, lack of religion and the ban of religion during communist rule have helped build the foundations of religious tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al.undp.org/content/dam/albania/docs/religious%20tolerance%20albania.pdf|title=Religious Tolerance in Albania|last=|first=|date=|website=|pages=45–46|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, estimations of the size of the irreligious population vary widely. The self declared atheist population has been given figures ranging from 2.5%&lt;ref name=census/&gt; to 8%&lt;ref name=Zuckerman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zuckerman|first1=Phil|authorlink1=Phil Zuckerman|editor1-last=Martin|editor1-first=Michael|title=The Cambridge Companion to Atheism|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521842709|pp=47–66|chapter=Atheism: Contemporary Numbers and Patterns}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 9%&lt;ref name="BademWINGallup"/&gt; while other estimates of irreligiosity have reported figures of 39% declaring as "atheists"(9%) or "nonreligious"(30%),&lt;ref name="BademWINGallup"/&gt; 61% not saying religion was "important" to their lives,&lt;ref name="BademWINGallup"/&gt; and 72% "non-practicing".&lt;ref name=AutreRegard/&gt; Many Albanians identified as Muslims or Christians have been found to practice only few or none of their faith's observances. Based on studies conducted in 2008, 2009 and 2015, Albania was found out to be the 20th least religious country in the world, with 39% of the population being religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/most-religious-countries-in-the-world/|title=Mapped: The world's most (and least) religious countries|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious identity in Albania is typically assigned by attribution, usually by familial history, rather than actual practice.&lt;ref name=Hayden/&gt;&lt;ref name=DeRapper/&gt; Despite widespread lack of religious practice, some antipathy toward outward atheists has been detected in surveys,&lt;ref name="HowReligious"/&gt; and while there are numerous public figures who openly declare themselves as atheist, there have also been complaints about negative public discourse toward atheists.&lt;ref name="Rugova"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Faik_Konica.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Faik Konitza|Faik Bey Konitza]], Albanian national revivalist, who, two years after his conversion from Islam to Catholicism, wrote invective against all religions]]
[[File:HODŽA_druhá_míza.jpg|thumb|right|120px|[[Enver Hoxha]] took Pashko Vasa's words literally, banning public religion though some private practice continued]] 
[[File:Lasgush Poradeci 1999 Albania stamp.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Lasgush Poradeci]] wrote the atheistic poem "Eskursioni teologjik i Sokratit"]]

In the late [[Ottoman Albania|Ottoman era]], in order to overcome the religious divisions among Albanians between members of the local [[Sunni Muslim]], [[Orthodox Christian]], [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi Muslim]] and [[Roman Catholic Christian]] communities. [[Albanian nationalism]], as it emerged, tended to urge Albanians to disregard religious differences, arguing that divisive sectarian religious fanaticism was alien to Albanian culture, and propagated what some historians refer to as a "'civic religion' of Albanianism".&lt;ref name="Duizings6162"&gt;Duijzings, Ger. "Religion and the Politics of 'Albanianism'". In Schwandler-Stevens and Jurgen, ''Albanian Identities: Myth and History''. Pages 61-62. Page 62: "nationalist rhetoric declared it [religion/millet] to be unimportant (and that religious fanaticism to be alien to the Albanian soul)", page 61:"From the beginning, national ideologists propagated a kind of 'civil religion' of Albanianism, which was epitomized in Pashko Vasa's famous and influential nationalist poem ''O moj Shqypni'' ("O poor Albania"): "Awaken, Albanians, wake from your slumber. Let us all be brothers, swear an oath not to mind church or mosque. The faith of the Albanian is Albanianism!'"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pashko Vasa]]'s famous poem ''[[O moj Shqypni]]'' told Albanians to "swear an oath not to mind [lit. "look to"] church or mosque" because "the faith of the Albanian is Albanianism" ({{lang-sq|feja e shqiptarit është shqiptaria}} or in {{lang-aln|Feja e shqyptarit asht shqyptarija}}).&lt;ref name="Duizings6162"/&gt;

[[Albanian National Revival|Albanian national revivalists]] in the 19th century such as [[Faik Konitza]], [[Jani Vreto]] and [[Zef Jubani]] were often anti-clerical in rhetoric (Konitza said in 1897: "Every faith religion makes me puke", or {{lang-sq|Më vjen për të vjellur nga çdo fe}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |url= http://gazeta-shqip.com/lajme/2014/09/11/myslimanet-shqiptare-ne-anen-e-gabuar-te-historise/ |title= Myslimanët shqiptarë, “në anën e gabuar të historisë” |date=11 September 2014 |accessdate= 27 July 2017 |work= Gazeta Shqip |quote= Është spekuluar shumë lidhur me identitetin fetar të Konicës.

During the [[Communist Albania|communist era]], Albania transitioned from a simple secular state to, in 1967, an entity upholding [[state atheism]] by which all public practice of religion was banned, although some private practice survived.&lt;ref name=VickersSurvive&gt;{{citation|first=Miranda |last=Vickers|first2= James|last2=Pettifer|publisher=NYU Press|year=2000|isbn=081478805X|title=Albania: From Anarchy to a Balkan Identity|pages=99,109|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Gm8TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of anti-religious policies implemented by the [[Party of Labour of Albania|Communist Party of Albania]] was in August 1946, with the [[Land reform in Albania|Agrarian Reform Law]] which nationalized most of the property of religious institutions, restricted the activity of religious institutions, and preceded the persecution of many clergy and believers and the expulsion of all foreign Catholic priests.&lt;ref name="country-data.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-186.html|title=Albania – Hoxha's Antireligious Campaign|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 [[Enver Hoxha]] took [[Pashko Vasa]]'s poem literally, turning the struggle against the divisiveness of religious affiliations into a struggle against religion itself in order to replace the divisive allegiances of the different religious communities with a unifying loyalty to the Communist state,&lt;ref&gt;Duijzings, Ger. "Religion and the Politics of 'Albanianism'". In Schwandler-Stevens and Jurgen, ''Albanian Identities: Myth and History''. Page 62-63: "Enver Hoxha took Pashko Vasa's motto literally and made Albania the first 'atheist' state in the world... the struggle against religious divisions evolved into a fight against religion ''per se'', which aimed to replace the diverging allegiances to religious communities with one undivided loyalty to the Communist Party. In spite of Enver Hoxha's radical Stalinist outlook, it was nationalism which provided the backbone to his policies: his harsh treatment of religious communities should primarily be seen in this light."&lt;/ref&gt; and he declared Albania an [[State atheism|Atheist State]], in which public religious practice was prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Squires|first=Nick|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/albania/11111799/Pope-visits-Albania-10-things-you-may-not-know-one-of-Europes-least-understood-countries.html|title=Pope visits Albania: 10 things you may not know one of Europe's least understood countries|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=21 September 2014|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tarifa2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tarifa|first=Fatos|authorlink=Fatos Tarifa|title=To Albania, with Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_psf3aN5NMC&amp;pg=PA68|accessdate=16 April 2017|year=2007|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-3590-5|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NielsenAkgönül2014"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Nielsen|editor1-first=Jørgen|editor1-link=Jørgen S.

[[Mother Teresa]], an ethnic Albanian, visited Tirana in 1989, where she was received by the foreign minister and by Hoxha's widow.

In 2014, following a visit by [[Pope Francis]] to Albania, some intellectuals criticized what they perceived as negative rhetoric aimed at atheists, which increasingly linked atheism to "communist crimes" and spoke of atheism as "deficient", leading to complaints that the revival of an anti-atheist "taboo",&lt;ref name="Rugova"/&gt; among other issues.&lt;ref name=statistikat/&gt;

In Albania, religious identity is typically defined by ''attribution'', typically via one's familial religious background, rather than actual adherence,&lt;ref name=Hayden&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hayden | first1 = Robert M | year = 2002 | title = Antagonistic Tolerance.

It thus possible to say that in Devoll, as elsewhere in Albania and the Balkans, one belongs to a religious community by attribution rather than by adherence. Belonging to a religious community, or ‘religion’, is not only a matter of faith. The social implications of religious attribution are visible at different levels of social life."&lt;/ref&gt;  and regardless of an individual's religiosity or lack thereof, it can still be socially significant, as it is occasionally linked to [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|historical socioeconomic and cultural factors]] in some contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = De Rapper | first1 = Gilles | year = 2008 | title = Religion in Post-Communist Albania: Muslims, Christians, and the idea of 'culture' in Devoll, Southern Albania | url = | journal = Anthropological Notebooks | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 31–45 [37–39] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antipathy toward overt atheists has been detected in surveys—in one edition of the [[World Values Survey]], 19.7% of Catholics, 17% of Muslims, and 9.4% of Orthodox "strongly agreed" that "those who don't believe in God" are unfit for office (total agreeing: 47.3% of Catholics, 46.9% of Muslims and 37% of Orthodox).&lt;ref name="HowReligious"/&gt; According to a 2011 study by Ipsos, 53.5% of the Albanians found found atheists "similar" to them while 34.1% found them "different".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hf.uio.no/ilos/forskning/prosjekter/nation-w-balkan/dokumenter/nb_albania-wine-summer.pdf |title=Nation Building |publisher=[[Ipos]] |accessdate=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Albanian intellectuals have complained about the revival of a "taboo" against atheism as seen in the rhetoric surrounding the 2014 visit of the Pope to the country where atheism was linked to "communist crimes" and seen as "deficient", and that the new Albanian constitution claims trust in God as a "universal" value despite the significant number of people who don't believe in God in the country.&lt;ref name="Rugova"&gt;{{cite article|url=http://www.gazetaexpress.com/oped/ateizmi-po-behet-tabu-44705/amp/?archive=1|title=Ateizmi po behet tabu|author=Ylli Rugova|publisher=Gazeta Express|date=23 September 2014}}. Quote: "Në diskursin dominant në Shqipëri është bërë krejt e natyrshme që ateizmi të paraqitet si diçka e mangët në krahasim me religjionin. Në anën tjetër religjioni të paraqitet si një pasuri shtesë në jetën e njeriut. Pasuri që ka qenë e ndaluar për popullin shqiptar gjatë periudhës totalitariste. Ky deformim në hartën semantike të diskursit shqiptar u shpërfaq krejt qartë edhe gjatë vizitës së Papës në Shqipëri. Gati në të gjitha fjalimet u përmend me të madhe ajo që u quajt “krimet e ateizmit komunist”. Këtu në fakt e kishin fjalën për krimet ndaj të gjitha ideologjive që ishin bërë gjatë periudhës kur Shqipëria kishte diktaturë. Por me këtë formulimin “krimet e ateizmit komunist” po dilte thuaja ka qenë ateizmi ai që ka shtyrë liderët e asaj kohe të ndërtojnë një sistem totalitar represiv.

Mos të harrojmë që njerëzit që nuk besojnë në zot nuk janë të paktë në numër. "&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been complaints about discourse both in Albania and by foreigners which cites statistics of the traditional population shares of the different Muslim and Christian sects present, which would show the country to be a 100% religious country, thus erasing the presence of the irreligious.&lt;ref name=statistikat&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.360grade.al/politike/item/4009-feja-dhe-statistikat-fetare-ne-shqiperi-sipas-ateisteve|title=Feja dhe statistikat fetare në Shqipëri, sipas Ateisteve|website=360grade.al|accessdate=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If it were the exclusive platform of those who believe in God, there are few who would be here. Therefore this is why I have taught myself for many years, at first from my office and then from inner impulse, that around the Iftar table we come as practicers of different faiths but some of us (also as) non-believers to pay respect.

'''Islam in Mongolia''' is practiced by approximately 3 to 5% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;2010 Population and Housing Census of Mongolia. Data recorded in Brian J. Grim et al. ''Yearbook of International Religious Demography 2014''. BRILL, 2014. p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewforum.org/uploadedfiles/Topics/Demographics/Muslimpopulation.pdf Muslim Population] Pewforum&lt;/ref&gt; It is practised by the ethnic [[Kazakhs]] of [[Bayan-Ölgii Province]] (88.7% of total aimag population) and [[Khovd Province]] (11.5% of total aimag population, living primarily in the [[Khovd (city)|Khovd city]], [[Khovd, Khovd|Khovd]] [[Sums of Mongolia|sum]], and [[Buyant, Khovd|Buyant]] sum) [[Aimags of Mongolia|aimag]] in western [[Mongolia]]. In addition, a number of small Kazakh communities can be found in various cities and towns spread throughout the country.

==History==
The earliest evidence of Islam in Mongolia is dated to 1254 when the Franciscan [[William of Rubruck]] visited the court of the great khan Mongka at [[Karakorum]]. He celebrated Easter at a [[Nestorian Christian]] church but also noted seven temples of the "idolators" (possibly Buddhist, Hindu and Taoist temples) and two mosques. Therefore, historians date the arrival of Islam to Mongolia to between 1222 and 1254. Islam also gained the notice of the Mongols after Genghis Khan invaded [[Afghanistan]]. In 1222, on his way back to Mongolia, he visited [[Bukhara]] in [[Transoxiana]]. It was believed he inquired about Islam, and subsequently approved of Muslim tenets except the [[Hajj]], considering it unnecessary. Nevertheless, he continued his worship of [[Tengri]] as his ancestors had done.

Genghis Khan and the following Yuan emperors forbade Islamic practices like Halal butchering, forcing Mongol methods of butchering animals on Muslims, and other restrictive degrees continued. Muslims had to slaughter sheep in secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&amp;pg=PA24 |title=China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects|author=Michael Dillon|year=1999|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond|page=24|isbn=0-7007-1026-4|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genghis Khan directly called Muslims and Jews "slaves" and demanded that they follow the Mongol method of eating rather than the halal method. [[Circumcision]] was also forbidden. Jews were also affected and forbidden by the Mongols to eat [[Kosher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=N7_4Gr9Q438C&amp;pg=PA230 |title=Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road|author=Johan Elverskog|year=2010|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|edition=illustrated|location=|page=228|isbn=0-8122-4237-8|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Among all the [subject] alien peoples only the Hui-hui say “we do not eat Mongol food”. [Cinggis Qa’an replied:] “By the aid of heaven we have pacified you; you are our slaves. Yet you do not eat our food or drink. How can this be right?” He thereupon made them eat. “If you slaughter sheep, you will be considered guilty of a crime.” He issued a regulation to that effect ... [In 1279/1280 under Qubilai] all the Muslims say: “if someone else slaughters [the animal] we do not eat”. Because the poor people are upset by this, from now on, Musuluman [Muslim] Huihui, and Zhuhu [Jewish] Huihui, no matter who kills [the animal] will eat [it] and must cease slaughtering sheep themselves, and cease the rite of circumcision.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicpopulation.com/asia/China/China_integration%20of%20religious%20minority.pdf |title=The Integration of Religious Minorities in China: The Case of Chinese Muslims |author=Donald Daniel Leslie |year=1998 |page=12 |publisher=The Fifty-ninth George Ernest Morrison Lecture in Ethnology |accessdate=30 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217112014/http://islamicpopulation.com/asia/China/China_integration%20of%20religious%20minority.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2010 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Genghis Khan's grandson [[Berke]] converted to Islam due to the efforts of Saif ud-Din Dervish, a [[dervish]] from [[Khorazm]], thus Berke became one of the first Mongol rulers to convert.  Other Mongol leaders owed their conversion to Islam due to the influence of a Muslim wife.&lt;ref name ="Arnold" /&gt;  Later, it was the [[Mamluk]] ruler [[Baibars]] who played an important role in bringing many [[Golden Horde]] Mongols to [[Islam]].  Baibars developed strong ties with the Mongols of the [[Golden Horde]] and took steps for the Golden Horde Mongols to travel to [[Egypt]].  The arrival of the Golden Horde Mongols to Egypt resulted in a significant number of Mongols accepting Islam.&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;[[Thomas Walker Arnold|Arnold, Thomas Walker]], ''The Preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith''. Lahore: Sh. Muhammad Ashraf, 1896; pp. 192, 334&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1330s, three of the four major khanates of the [[Mongol Empire]] had become Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia Americana'', by Grolier Incorporated, p. 680&lt;/ref&gt; These were the [[Golden Horde]], [[Il-Khanate|Hulagu's Ulus]] and [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai's Ulus]]. The [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] Empire also embraced Muslim peoples such as the [[Persian people|Persians]].

Although the court of the Yuan Empire adopted [[Tibetan Buddhism]] as the official religion, the majority of the ordinary [[Mongols]], especially those who continued living in Mongolia proper, remained Shamanists. After the decline of the Yuan Dynasty, [[Shamanism]] once again became the dominant religion. To varying degrees, political and economic relations with Muslim nations such as [[Moghulistan]] continued.

The Muslim Kazakhs began to settle in the [[Jungaria]] and [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] regions in the late nineteenth century. The majority of these Kazakhs were the Kerei and Naiman clans, many of them escaping persecution in Czarist Russia. When [[Bogdo Khan]]  assumed power in Mongolia on December 29, 1911, the Kazakhs in Xinjiang and Altai regions sought the patronage of the restored Khanate. The government of Bogdo Khan admitted them and allowed them to settle in the western region of Mongolia's Kobdo territory.

===Communist era===
Bayan-Ölgii aimag was established as part of the administrative reforms of the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] in 1940. As a result of historically high birth rates, the Muslim population in Mongolia increased between 1956 and 1989. However, there was a decline in the Muslim population&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2779.htm US State department: Mongolia background note]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mg.html CIA: The World Factbook]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1990-1993 due to the large wave of [[repatriation]] of ethnic Kazakhs (so-called oralmans) to [[Kazakhstan]] following the break-up of the Soviet Union.

==Today==
Islam is currently practiced predominately in the western portion of the country as well as in Mongolia's capital.  Some of the major population centers with a significant Muslim presence include [[Ulan Bator]] (90% in [[khoroo]] #4 of [[Nalaikh]] [[düüreg]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/English/bodies/cerd/docs/ngos/soc.pdf ''Education of Kazakh children: a situation analysis''.

Adherents of [[Jainism]] first arrived in the United Kingdom (UK) in the 19th century. The UK, mainly England, has since become a center of the Jain diaspora.

==History==
In 1873 [[Hermann Jacobi]] encountered [[Jain texts]] in London. He later visited India to further study and translate some of them. Later during 1891-1901, M.K. [[Gandhi]] in London corresponded with [[Shrimad Rajchandra]] regarding questions raised by missionaries.

[[Champat Rai Jain]] was in England during 1892-1897, to study law. He established the Rishabh Jain Lending library 1930. Later he translated several Jain texts into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jainsamaj.org/rpg_site/literature2.php |title=on www.jainsamaj.org ( Jainism, Ahimsa News, Religion, Non-Violence, Culture, Vegetarianism, Meditation, India. ) |publisher=Jainsamaj.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1906-1910, Jugmandar Lal Jaini was at [[Oxford]] as a law student. In 1909 he created the Jain Literature Society in London together with F. W. Thomas and H. Warren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/98/1/The_Invention_of_Jainism_(without_photo).pdf |title=Microsoft Word - The Invention of Jainism _without photo_ |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 The World Jaina Mission was founded in London, by M. McKay, W. H. Talbot, F. Mansell, and Mrs. K. P. Jain.

==Exodus of Asians from East Africa  ==
After the independence of [[East Africa|East African colonies]] from  Britain in early 1960s, Jains of Gujarati origin  who had been in the colonies for decades started moving to UK. This process accelerated   after the 1972 [[Idi Amin]] expulsion of  Asians  from Uganda.Most of the Gujarati Jains from East Africa belonged either to the Visa Oshwal community, originally from the [[Halar]] region of [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] or the Jamnagar Srimali community .&lt;ref name="DreschDresch2000"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marcus Banks |editor2=Wendy James |editor1=Paul Dresch |editor3=David J.

==Jain Samaj Leicester==
In 1973 the Jain Samaj Leicester was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaincentre.com/ |title=Jain Samaj Europe |publisher=Jaincentre.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WerbnerWerbner2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marcus Banks |editor=Pnina Werbner |title=Black and Ethnic Leaderships |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=je-IAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA154 |year=2009 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-96569-4 |pages=154–162 |chapter=Competing to give, competing to get. Gujarati Jains in Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 an old church building on Oxford Street, in the heart of Leicester, was bought and named the Jain Centre. In 1980, the Jain Samaj was expanded as a European body.

In 1982, the Jain Samaj opened an office in London. The All India (Overseas) Jinalaya Samiti was created  to complete the temple according to the plans drawn by the architects from Leicester, Bombay and Ahmedabad.

In 1983, on 10 November, Shilanyas ceremony (the laying of the foundation stones) for the first fully consecrated Jain temple in the western world, was performed. In 1984, on 14 December, the Anjanshalaka ceremony was carried at Pali for the images of [[Shantinath]], [[Mahavir]] and [[Parswanath]]. In 1985, on 25 August, the above images were placed in the Jain Centre, Leicester. In 1988, on 8 July, the images were entered in the Garbagriha (permanent place of adobe) and the [[Pratistha]] ceremony was celebrated for 16 days from 8 July 1988 to 23 July 1988.
==MAHAVIR FOUNDATION==
Mahavir Foundation was registered as a Charity in England and Wales (no 296175). It operates a temple in Kenton, Middlesex (London). It has consecrated images of Mahavir Swami, Parshvanath, Aadinath, Simandhar Swami and Munisuvrat Swami. It also has Padmavati Mata and Gautam Swami. There is a separate shrine of Manibhadra Veer, Ghantakarna Veer and Nakoda Bhairavji

'''James Gordon Lindsay''' (June 18, 1906 – April 1, 1973) was a revivalist preacher, author, and founder of [[Christ for the Nations Institute]].

Born in [[Zion, Illinois]], Lindsay's parents were disciples of [[John Alexander Dowie]], the father of healing revivalism in America. After the family moved to [[Portland, Oregon]], the young boy was influenced by [[John G. Lake]] and converted by [[Charles Fox Parham]]. At the age of eighteen he began his ministry as a traveling evangelist, conducting meetings in [[Assembly of God]] churches and other [[Pentecostal]] groups.

==Biography==
[[File:Young_Brown,_Jack_Moore,_William_Branham,_Oral_Roberts,_Gordon_Lindsay_Kansas_City_1948.jpg|thumb|right|From left: Young Brown, Jack Moore, [[William Branham]], [[Oral Roberts]], [[Gordon Lindsay]]; photo taken at [[Kansas City]] in 1948]]
James Gordon Lindsay was born and raised in an atmosphere of healing and Pentecostal experience. He was born in Zion City, Illinois, on June 18, 1906. His parents were Thomas Lindsay and Effie (Ramsey) Lindsay. They were followers of John Alexander Dowie, a famous healing evangelist. When the city went bankrupt, after the fall of Dowie, the Lindsay family moved to a Christian community in California, led by Pisgah Finis E. Yoakum, and then to Portland, Oregon. He converted during a meeting led by [[Charles Fox Parham]], the initiator of the Pentecostal movement in Topeka, Kansas. He then developed a relationship with John G. Lake, who started the Divine Healing Mission in Spokane, Washington and Portland, Oregon. Lindsay traveled with Lake in the campaigns of California and the southern states. Then he became a pastor of a [[International Church of the Foursquare Gospel|Foursquare Gospel]] church in California, but returned to Oregon, where he married Freda Schimpf.

==Voice of Healing==
[[File:Voice_of_Healing_Magazine_Cover,_May_1948.jpg|thumb|right|April 1948 cover of ''Voice of Healing'' magazine]]
When [[World War II]] broke out, Lindsay accepted a call to become pastor of a church in [[Ashland, Oregon]] in early 1940.  He first heard [[William Branham]] in a meeting in [[Sacramento]] and, after meeting with him, they both agreed that Lindsay should act as Branham's campaign manager.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Freda, My Diary Secrets, Christ for the Nations, Inc., Dallas, TX, 1976, p.109&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1947 he resigned his pastoral position to become campaign manager for Branham. In order to promote the campaign, Lindsay started the "[[Voice of Healing]]" in April 1948, a magazine of wide circulation, particularly in the southern US. The first issue listed William Branham as Publisher, Gordon Lindsay as Editor, [[Jack Moore (preacher)|Jack Moore]] as Associate Editor, and Anna Jeanne Moore as Circulation Editor.&lt;ref&gt;The Voice of Healing, An Inter-Evangelical Publication of the Branham Healing Campaign, Vol. 1, No. 1, April 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months later in July 1948, Branham announced he was stepping away from the revival circuit for a time.&lt;ref&gt;The Voice of Healing, An Inter-Evangelical Publication of the Latter-Day Sign-Gift Ministries, Vol. 1, No. 4, July 1948&lt;/ref&gt; The news came as quite a blow to Lindsay who had just begun the revival publication to cover Branham's meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Lindsay, [http://www.vrijezending.nl/docs/lindsy2.htm "William Branham as I knew him" (fragments)] Vrije Zendingshulp&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage of other evangelists, such as [[Jack Coe]], [[Oral Roberts]],  and [[A. A. Allen]] began to appear in the magazine as it circulated nationwide. The group sponsored the first convention of healing evangelists in [[Dallas, Texas]] during 1949 and began to function as a loose fellowship of ministers under the Voice of Healing banner. In 1950 a biography of Branham written by Lindsay ("William Branham: A Man Sent from God") was published.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/WILLIAM-BRANHAM-Man-Sent-God/dp/B0048M9GGK&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 1950, Branham was no longer the publisher but was listed as an associate editor.  The [[Masthead (publishing)|masthead]] listed the following editors:

*Gordon Lindsay - Editor
*[[Jack Moore (preacher)|Jack Moore]] - Co-editor
*Anna Jeanne Moore - Managing editor
*[[F. F. Bosworth]] - Associate editor
*Wilbur Ogilvie - Associate editor
*[[William Branham]] - Associate editor
*O.L. Jaggers - Associate editor
*Harvey McAlister - Associate editor
*[[T. L. Osborn]] - Associate editor
*Dale Hanson - Associate editor
*Gayle Jackson - Associate editor&lt;ref&gt;The Voice of Healing, Vol. 3, No. 7, October 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

As the popularity of some of its members rose, they left the fellowship to establish their own organizations and publish their own literature.

Lindsay's own work began to move in the direction of missions. He began sponsoring missions programs in several foreign countries and started a radio ministry. During 1956 he conducted a Winning the Nations Crusade, sending teams of ministers all around the world. The Voice of Healing magazine changed names briefly to World-Wide Revival in 1968 before the final change to Christ for the Nations. One of Lindsay's last visions before his death was a [http://www.cfni.org/ bible training institute] in [[Dallas, Texas]]. [[Christ For The Nations Institute]] began in 1970 and has trained thousands of students from around the world.

Lindsay was a prolific writer, publishing over 250 volumes of historical and doctrinal books on the healing revival movement. His ministry came to a halt with his sudden death on April 1, 1973. Lindsay's wife Freda and family continued the work he began. Christ for the Nations, Inc. has five main facets: a national church program; a national literature work; a Jewish mission in [[Israel]]; [http://www.cfni.org/ national and international Bible training schools]; and a prayer and tape ministry.

Gordon Lindsay was also the first Evangelical preacher/writer to assume a link between the UFO phenomenon of his day and the fallen Angels ([[Nephilim]]) in Genesis 6. He wrote several books about the subject,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibeltemplet.net/bibletemple/pioneer_christian_writings_on_ufos.html Pioneer Christian Writings on Flying Saucers and UFOs]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as articles in the Voice of Healing Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godsgenerals.com/PDF/1954_APRIL.pdf Voice of Healing April 1954]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindsay, as well as Charles Cullis (70 years earlier), felt there was need for a literature that covered the history, theology and healing experience. He wrote over 250 books and pamphlets, besides being a regular contributor to the Voice of Healing magazine. Feeling a call to develop missions and evangelistic work, he sponsored campaigns to international missions. He started a radio program and along with WA Raiford, founded the International Club of Churches and Ministers of the Full Gospel. During 1956, he held a Winning Cross of Nations, in order to send teams of ministers to the whole world. The Voice of Healing magazine changed its name to Christ For The Nations.

His daughter Shira is married to Pastor Ari Sorko-Ram, who founded the Maoz Israel ministry in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;shorashim.co.uk [http://www.shorashim.co.uk/messianic-yeshiva/israel-the-church-and-the-jewish-people/spiritual-revival-in-israel-shira-sorko-ram/ Spiritual Revival in Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christ For The Nations Institute==
Lindsay taught people to be missionaries in the nations, the power of the name of Jesus, and the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Then in 1970 he founded [[Christ for the Nations Institute | Christ For The Nations Institute (CFNI)]] together with his wife. It now has over 1200 students with 250 international students from 50 different nations.

Lindsay died unexpectedly on April 1, 1973, in a time of worship in the Institute. He was 66.

Freda Lindsay, his wife, diligently continued his dream of founding apostolic churches, developing ministers and supporting many students. She remained active as the President of CFNI until she retired in her 90s. "Mom" Lindsay died in her home on March 26, 2010, at the age of 95 on "Gordon Lindsay Day," a day the institute had designated to remember and honor the legacy of the founder.

His son, Dennis Lindsay, is the current president of CFNI &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfni.org/explore-about-who-we-are CFNI - Who We Are - Leadership]&lt;/ref&gt; and continues the work that his parents started.

The religious texts for each tribe consists of customs, habits, rituals, traditions, and myths passed down from the Kirati tribe's ancestors. Religious texts serve, in a way, as customary laws which guide Kirats in their daily lives.&lt;ref name="BockRao65"&gt;p. 65 ''Culture, Creation, and Procreation'' By Monika Böck, Aparna Rao&lt;/ref&gt; Their religious texts also distinguishes each Kiranti tribe from other Kirati and non-Kiratis as well.&lt;ref name="BockRao65"/&gt;

==Practices==
Kirats practice [[shamanism]] and their rituals are mostly related to the worship of mother nature, ancestors, sun, moon, wind, fire and main pillar of house. Almost all sacred rituals, in Rai, are performed by ''[[nakchong]]'', the Rai tribal priest. Similarly [[Limbu]]s have phɛdɑŋmɑ/bɑ, yɛbɑ/mɑ, sɑmbɑ/mɑ to perform rituals accordingly. Their supreme deity ''Tagera Ningwaphuma: tɑgɛrɑ niŋwɑphumɑ'' is personified as [[Yuma Sammang]] as female and Theba Sammang as male in earthly form. Some Limbus have their own distinct form of worship known as [[Yuma Sammang]] is mother of all the Limbus their follower are '''Yumaism'''; they venerate a [[King of the Gods|supreme goddess]].

===Festivals===
[[File:Sakela sili.jpg|thumb|Kirat Rai celebrating the festival Sakela Osman]]
All four Kirats celebrate some similar and different festivals throughout the year. Some common festivals are [[Udhauli]], [[Ubhauli]] and New year [[Yele Sambat]] ([[Maghe Sankranti]]).

[[Sakela]] is the main festival of Khambu Kirat [Rai], in this festival they worship mother nature and their Ancestor's [who is believed to be staying in their Chulla (fire place build by three stone, each stone has a unique meaning) and garden]. This festival is celebrated twice a year distinguished by two names Ubhauli and Udhauli.  [[Sakela]] Ubhauli is celebrated during [[Baisakh Purnima]] (full moon day, which lies in the month of Baisakh in calendars of the Indian Subcontinent.) and [[Sakela]] Udhauli is celebrated during the full moon day in the month of Mangh. In Ubhauli they prey for the goodness of family and good weather for cultivation and in Udhauli they thanks the mother nature and ancestor for their blessing and good harvest. 

In both Ubhauli and Udhauli they sacrifice a rooster and worship by Ginger, Rice, homemade alcohol, and tree resin (resin is put in the burning coal for fragrance) and conduct a Sakela dance. In this dance they performs all the daily life activity (example planting rice, harvesting etc.) and also try to copy the behavior of animals and birds which are part of their day to day life. The Limbu Kirat celebrate udhauli [[Chasok Tangnam]] on the day of Mangsir Purnima and Ubhauli (Yokwa Tongnam) in the month of [[Baisakh]]. Other Kirats (Yakkha and Sunuwars) also celebrate in their own way. Sakela celebration is the prayer to Goddess of Nature for good crops and protection from natural calamities.

The celebration of Sakela is also known as Chandi Nach Murat. On Chandi Nach, they worship Durga, who is known to them as [[Chandi]], or Chandika.&lt;ref&gt;p. 76 ''Kiratas in Ancient India'' By G. P. Singh, Dhaneswar Kalita, V Sudarsen, M A Kalam&lt;/ref&gt; (Worship of [[Durga]] among the Himalayan Kiratas is arguably written in the ''[[Harivamsa|Harivamsha Purana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;p. 195 ''Ancient Communities of the Himalaya'' By Dinesh Prasad Saklani&lt;/ref&gt;) Durga Puja is still performed by a few Kirants.&lt;ref name="Subba108"&gt;p. 108 ''Politics of Culture:A study of three Kirata communities in the Eastern Himalayas'' by T.B. Subba&lt;/ref&gt;

Tihar is another festival that was added first in the Veda. It is also known as [[Deepavali]] and Lakshmi Puja.&lt;ref name="Subba108"/&gt;

'''Koyash''' (Turkish: ''Kuyaş'') is the [[god]] of sun in [[Turkic mythology|Turkish mythology]].

[[Gök Tanrı]] created the earth with rays of sun light, thus, Koyash took part in the creation of earth. Solar rays are also considered to be "strings" between the sun and the [[spirit]]s of plants, animals and humans.

Turks who worship Koyash turn towards the sunrise when praying. Koyash is the son of Gok Tengri "''Sky God''" (Tenger means sky in Mongolian) and the Earth Goddess. The power and vital force of the Sun God, making it a priority to bow to him each morning as he rises. Solar rays are strings that link the spirits of plants to heaven, and considered a medium for transmitting Tengri into infants. Koyash is often depicted as a fiery bird or a winged horse. These images are often used to adorn things such as ceramic pots and earrings in ancient times.

The sun god Koyash can make "solar strands" from his hands capable of ensnaring and burning his victims. To the Altai people, the sun represented light, warmth, and growth. This made the sun deity very important, as the sun was seen as the ruler of all that he created. Then he is portrayed as a warrior.

==Sun in Turkish culture==
The Sun (also Koyash) was the son of Gök-Tengri (Sky God) and the Toprak Ana (Earth Goddess). The Turkish people and Mongols honoured the power and vital force of the Sun God. Reportedly the Huns, leaving their villages in the morning, welcomed the rising sun and bowed towards him. Altai people would turn towards the sunrise when praying. They worshipped the Sun because Gok-Tengri supervised the creation of the world by the Sun’s rays, which are but strings linking the spirits of plants to the Sun. Likewise solar rays were considered a medium for transmitting the life force sent by Tengri to the infant.

A vivid example is the legend of the birth of [[An Lushan]] by a Shamaness. At his conception it was said that a ray of light penetrated the yurt. Alan-Goa, the mother of the Mongols, conceived from a ray that penetrated the yurt through a smoke hole. The Turkish people associated the Sun’s path in the sky with the flight of a fire-bird or a winged horse. Flying (winged) horses as symbols of the Sun were widely used in the cosmological myths of Turkish peoples. And other animals (rams, deer, bulls) were also connected with the Sun.

The '''Kuzari''', full title '''''The Book of Refutation and Proof in Support of the Abased Religion''''' ({{lang-ar|كتاب الحجة والدليل في نصرة الدين الذليل}}), also known as the '''Book of the Kuzari''', ({{lang-he-n|ספר הכוזרי}}) is one of the most famous works of the medieval [[History of the Jews in Spain|Spanish Jewish]] philosopher and poet [[Judah Halevi]], completed around 1140. It is regarded as one the most important apologetic works of [[Jewish philosophy]].

Divided into five parts ("ma'amarim" – articles), it takes the form of a dialogue between a rabbi and a pagan. The pagan is then mythologized as the [[monarch|king]] of the [[Khazars]] who has invited the [[rabbi]] to instruct him in the tenets of [[Judaism]]. Originally written in [[Arabic]], the book was translated by numerous scholars, including [[Judah ben Saul ibn Tibbon]], into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and other languages.

The question of whether Halevi's work had any historical basis regarding the Khazars' conversion to Judaism is controversial among scholars.{{cn|date=September 2017}}{{expand section|date=September 2017}}

== Introduction ==

[[File:1880 Warsaw Kuzari2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cover of the 1880 [[Hebrew language]] [[Warsaw]] edition of the Kuzari. Although the rabbi in the Kuzari is not named, the cover makes reference to [[Yitzhak ha-Sangari]].]]

After a short account of the incidents preceding the conversion of the king, and of his conversations with a [[philosopher]], a [[Christian]], and a [[Muslim]] concerning their respective beliefs, a Jew appears on the stage, and by his first statement startles the king; for, instead of giving him proofs of the existence of God, he asserts and explains the miracles performed by Him in favor of the [[Israelites]].

The king expresses his astonishment at this [[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]], which seems to him incoherent; but the Jew replies that the existence of God, the [[creation myth|creation]] of the world, etc., being taught by [[religion]], do not need any speculative demonstrations. Further, he propounds the principle upon which his religious system is founded; namely, that revealed religion is far superior to natural religion. For the aim of [[ethics|ethical]] training, which is the object of religion, is not to create in man good intentions, but to cause him to perform good deeds. This aim can not be attained by philosophy, which is undecided as to the nature of good, but can be secured by religious training, which teaches what is good. As [[science]] is the sum of all [[truth]] found by successive generations, so religious training is based upon a set of traditions; in other words, [[history]] is an important factor in the development of [[culture|human culture]] and science.

== "Creatio ex Nihilo" ==

Halevi writes that as the Jews are the only depositaries of a written history of the development of the human race from the beginning of the world, the superiority of their traditions can not be denied. Halevi asserts that no comparison is possible between [[Jewish culture]], which in his view is based upon religious truth, and [[Greek culture]], which is based upon science only. He holds that the wisdom of [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] lacked that divine support with which the Israelite prophets were endowed. Had a trustworthy tradition that the world was created out of nothing been known to [[Aristotle]], he would have supported it by at least as strong arguments as those advanced by him to prove the eternity of matter. Belief in the eternity of matter, however, is not absolutely contrary to Jewish religious ideas; for the Biblical narrative of the Creation refers only to the beginning of the human race, and does not preclude the possibility of preexistent matter.

Still, relying upon tradition, the Jews believe in "[[creationism (theology)|creatio ex nihilo]]," which [[theory]] can be sustained by as powerful arguments as those advanced in favor of the belief in the eternity of matter. The objection that the Absolutely Infinite and Perfect could not have produced imperfect and finite beings, made by the [[Neoplatonist]]s to the theory of "creatio ex nihilo," is not removed by attributing the existence of all mundane things to the action of [[nature]]; for the latter is only a link in the chain of causes having its origin in the [[First Cause]], which is God.

== Superiority of his faith ==

Halevi now attempts to demonstrate the superiority of his religion, Judaism. The preservation of the Israelites in [[Egypt]] and in the wilderness, the delivery to them of [[law|the Law]] on [[Mount Sinai]], and their later history are to him so many evident proofs of their superiority. He impresses upon the king the fact that the favor of God can be won only by accomplishing the precepts in their totality, and that those precepts are binding only on the adherents of Judaism. The question why the Jews were favored with God's instruction is answered in the Kuzari at I:95, as based upon their pedigree, i.e., Noah’s most pious son was Shem. His most pious son was Arpachshad etc. Abraham was Arpachshad's descendant. Isaac his most pious son and Jacob his most pious. The sons of Jacob were all worthy and their children became the Jews. The Jew then shows that the immortality of the [[soul]], [[resurrection]], reward, and punishment are all implied in [[Scripture]] and are referred to in Jewish writings.

== Question of attributes ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Divine simplicity]] --&gt;
{{See also|Divine simplicity|Negative theology#In the Jewish tradition}}
In the second essay Judah enters into a detailed discussion of some of the theological questions hinted at in the preceding one. To these belongs in the first place that of the divine attributes. Judah rejects entirely the doctrine of essential attributes which had been propounded by [[Saadia Gaon]] and [[Bahya ibn Paquda]]. For him there is no difference between essential and other attributes. Either the attribute affirms a quality in God, in which case essential attributes can not be applied to Him more than can any other, because it is impossible to predicate anything of Him, or the attribute expresses only the negation of the contrary quality, and in that case there is no harm in using any kind of attributes. 'Accordingly, Judah divides all the attributes found in the Bible into three classes: active, relative, and negative, which last class comprises all the essential attributes expressing mere negations.

The question of attributes being closely connected with that of anthropomorphism, Judah enters into a lengthy discussion on this point. Although opposed to the conception of the corporeality of God, as being contrary to Scripture, he would consider it wrong to reject all the sensuous concepts of anthropomorphism, as there is something in these ideas which fills the human soul with the awe of God.

The remainder of the essay comprises dissertations on the following subjects: the excellence of [[Israel]], the land of [[prophecy]], which is to other countries what the Jews are to other nations; the sacrifices; the arrangement of the Tabernacle, which, according to Judah, symbolizes the human body; the prominent spiritual position occupied by Israel, whose relation to other nations is that of the heart to the limbs; the opposition evinced by Judaism toward [[asceticism]], in virtue of the principle that the favor of God is to be won only by carrying out His precepts, and that these precepts do not command man to subdue the inclinations suggested by the [[faculties of the soul]], but to use them in their due place and proportion; the excellence of the [[Hebrew language]], which, although sharing now the fate of the Jews, is to other languages what the Jews are to other nations and what Israel is to other lands.

The third essay is devoted to the refutation of the teachings of Karaism and to the history of the development of the oral tradition, the [[Talmud]]. Judah ha-Levi shows that there is no means of carrying out the precepts without having recourse to oral tradition; and that such tradition has always existed may be inferred from many passages of the [[Bible]], the very reading of which is dependent upon it, since there were no [[vowel]]s and accents in the original text.

== Names of God ==

The fourth essay opens with an analysis of the various names of God found in the Bible. According to Judah, all these names, with the exception of the [[Tetragrammaton]], are attributes expressing the various states of God's activity in the world. The multiplicity of names no more implies a multiplicity in His essence than do the multifarious influences of the rays of the sun on various bodies imply a multiplicity of suns. To the intuitive vision of the prophet the actions proceeding from God appear under the images of the corresponding human actions. [[Angel]]s are God's messengers; and either they exist for a length of time, or they are created only for special purposes.

From the names of God and the essence of angels Judah passes to his favorite theme and shows that the views of the Prophets are a purer source for a knowledge of God than the teachings of the philosophers. Although he professes great reverence for the "[[Sefer Yetzirah|Sefer Yetẓirah]]," from which he quotes many passages, he hastens to add that the theories of [[Abraham]] elucidated therein had been held by the patriarch before God revealed Himself to him. The essay concludes with examples of the [[astronomy|astronomical]] and [[medicine|medical]] knowledge of the ancient Hebrews.

== Arguments against philosophy ==

The fifth and last essay is devoted to a criticism of the various philosophical systems known at the time of the author. Judah attacks by turns the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[cosmology]], [[psychology]], and [[metaphysics]]. To the doctrine of emanation, based, according to him, upon the Aristotelian cosmological principle that no simple being can produce a compound being, he objects in the form of the following query: "Why did the emanation stop at the lunar sphere? Why should each intelligence think only of itself and of that from which it issued and thus give birth to one emanation, thinking not at all of the preceding intelligences, and thereby losing the power to give birth to many emanations?"

He argues against the theory of [[Aristotle]] that the soul of man is his thought and that only the soul of the philosopher will be united, after the death of the body, with the active intellect. "Is there," he asks, "any curriculum of the knowledge one has to acquire to win immortality? How is it that the soul of one man differs from that of another? How can one forget a thing once thought of?" and many other questions of the kind. He shows himself especially severe against the Motekallamin, whose arguments on the creation of the world, on God and His unity, he terms dialectic exercises and mere phrases.

However, Judah ha-Levi is against philosophical speculation only in matters concerning Creation, God, etc.; and he follows the Greek philosophers in treating of the creation of the material world. Thus he admits that every being is made up of [[Hylomorphism|matter and form]]. The movement of the spheres formed the sphere of the elements, from the fusion of which all beings were created. This fusion, which varied according to climate, gave to matter the potentiality to receive from God a variety of forms, from the mineral, which is the lowest in the scale of creation, to man, who is the highest because of his possessing, in addition to the qualities of the [[mineral]], [[vegetable]], and [[animal]], a hylic intellect which is influenced by the active intellect. This hylic intellect, which forms the rational soul, is a spiritual substance and not an accident, and is therefore imperishable.

The discussion concerning the soul and its faculties leads naturally to the question of [[free will]]. Judah upholds the doctrine of free will against the [[Epicurean]]s and the [[Fatalist]]s, and endeavors to reconcile it with the belief in God's providence and omniscience.

== Influence of the Kuzari ==

Although the Kuzari failed to stem the philosophical flood which, at the time of the appearance of the work, was inundating Judaism, it exercised a great influence upon the theologians. It was much studied; and traces of it are to be found in all the theological and Kabbalistic writings of the Middle Ages.

The study of the Kuzari seems to have become very popular in the fifteenth century. No less than six commentaries on it appeared in the first half of that century. Many translations and commentaries on this work, both religious and critical, have been written since then.  It has had a resurgence of popularity in the Orthodox Jewish community in the modern era.

[[Image:1660 Buxtorf Kuzari.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Cover of the 1660 [[Latin language]] [[Buxtorf]] edition of the Kuzari.]]

== Translations ==

Besides the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] translation of Judah [[ibn Tibbon]], which passed through eleven editions (1st ed. Fano, 1506), another rendering into Hebrew was made by [[Judah ben Isaac Cardinal]], at the beginning of the thirteenth century.

In 1887 the Arabic original was published for the first time by Hartwig Hirschfeld, and in 1977 a modern critical text was published by David H. Baneth. Parallel to his Arabic edition, Hirschfeld also published a critical edition of the Ibn Tibbon translation of the text, based upon six medieval manuscripts. In 1885, Hirschfeld published the first German translation from the Arabic original, and in 1905 his English translation from Arabic appeared. In 1972, the first modern translation by Yehudah Even-Shemuel into Hebrew from the Arabic original was published. In 1994, a French translation by Charles Touati from the Arabic original was published. In 1997, a Hebrew translation by Rabbi [[Yosef Qafih]] from the Arabic original was published, which is now in its fourth edition (published in 2013). A 2009 English translation by Rabbi N. [[Daniel Korobkin]] is in print by Feldheim Publishers.

== Commentaries on the book ==

As mentioned above, six commentaries were printed in the fifteenth century, four of them known to us:

* ''Edut LeYisrael''- (literally, "witness for Israel"), by Rabbi Shlomo Ben Menachem.
* ''Kol Yehuda''- (literally, "the voice of Judah"), by Rabbi Yehuda Muskato.

And two commentaries of two students of Rabbi Shlomo Ben Menachem: Rabbi Yaakov Ben Parisol and Rabbi Netanel Ben Nechemya Hacaspi. (For more information, see the translation of Yehudah Even-Shemuel, preface, p. 53).

In the 20th century, several more commentaries were written, including:

* "The Kuzari - Commentary", by Rabbi [[Shlomo Aviner]], four volumes.
* "The Explained Kuzari", by Rabbi [[David Cohen (rabbi)|David Cohen]], three volumes.

All the above commentaries are in Hebrew.

== The Kuzari in the eyes of other rabbis ==

Rabbi [[Vilna Gaon|Eliyahu of Vilna]], said that the "Kuzari" is a holy and pure book, and it contains the basics of the Jewish faith. "Mahariaz Enzil", a student of the [[Aryeh Leib HaCohen Heller|Ketzos HaChoshen]], writes in his book that the "Kuzari" is the holy of the holies.

Many other references can be found in the preface of Yehudah Even-Shemuel to his translation.

This is a '''list of Christians in science and technology'''. Persons in this list should have their Christianity as relevant to their notable activities or public life, and who have publicly identified themselves as Christians or as of a Christian denomination.
&lt;!--

To achieve its goals each name must have a credible source or in least an explanatory note. If you can find multiple sources this is better, but it is not a requirement. However sourcing is necessary to show that their Christianity is notable to their place in history.

All these provisos noted there are aids to ease the adding of names to this list. At the bottom of this page potential sources are listed that you can use. Added to this several McTutor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/BiogIndex.html|title=Indexes of Biographies|publisher=|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; mathematician biographies mention if the mathematician or scientist did Christian religious or theological works. An effort should be made to assure that all entries on the list have proper references, but additions are welcome.

The [[Lamb (liturgy)|Lamb]] sits on the diskos (paten). To the left are [[Prosphora]] for the [[Theotokos]], the saints, the living and the departed.]]

The '''Liturgy of Preparation''', also '''Prothesis''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Πρόθεσις||a setting forth}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Prothesis |volume=22 |pages=475–476}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Proskomedia''' ({{lang|grc|Προσκομιδή}} ''Proskomidē'' "an offering, an oblation"), is the name given in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;and those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]]&lt;/ref&gt; to the act of preparing the [[bread]] and [[wine]] for the [[Eucharist]]. The Liturgy of Preparation is done quietly before the public part of the [[Divine Liturgy]] begins, and symbolizes the "hidden years" of Christ's earthly life.

==Eucharistic Elements==
Only very specific elements may be offered at the Divine Liturgy:

===Bread===
[[Image:Divine Liturgy Preparations at Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral, London.jpg|thumb|left|Prosphora prepared for the Liturgy of Preparation. The large loaves on the left are the five principal prosphora; the smaller loaves on the right are for the commemorations of the living and the dead by the faithful (Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral, London).]]

The bread used for the Liturgy is referred to as [[prosphora]]. A prosphoron is a round loaf of leavened bread baked in two layers to represent the two natures of Christ. It has a square seal on the top side which has inscribed on it a cross and the Greek letters IC (an abbreviation in Greek for "Jesus") XC ("Christ") and NIKA ("Conquers").&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Christogram]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The portion of the loaf that is cut out along this seal is the [[Lamb (Liturgy)|Lamb]] (Host), from which all are communicated, and therefore must be proportionately large for the number of communicants.

Prosphora must be made using only the finest wheat flour, water, salt, and yeast. It should be freshly baked and without blemish.

The Greeks use one large loaf for the Liturgy of Preparation, with a large round seal on it inscribed not only with the square seal mentioned above (from which the Lamb is taken), but also markings indicating where the portions for the [[Theotokos]], the Ranks, the Living and Dead are removed (see [[#Proskomedie|Proskomedie]], below).

Those churches which follow Slavic usage use five small loaves, recalling the five loaves from which Christ fed the multitude ({{bibleverse||John|6:5-14}}). Normally all are stamped with a small square seal, though special seals for the Theotokos are sometimes used.

In all traditions, only the Lamb is actually consecrated, other portions which are removed from the prosphora are memorials, but are never to be used for Communion.

===Wine===
The Wine used must be red grape wine, and it must be fermented. Orthodox tend to favor [[altar wine]] that is somewhat sweet, though this is not a requirement.

These elements are referred to collectively as the "Gifts", both before and after the Consecration.

==Ceremony==
[[Image:Proskomidi.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Liturgy of the preparation just before conclusion.]]
The [[Euchologion|Priest's Service Book]] states that, before celebrating the Divine Liturgy, the priest must be reconciled to all men, keep his heart from evil thoughts, and be fasting since midnight. The same rules apply to the deacon.

The beginning of the Liturgy of Preparation should be timed so that it is concluded slightly before the [[Reader (liturgy)#Orthodoxy|Reader]] finishes reading the [[Terce#Eastern Christian Office|Third Hour]] and [[Sext#Eastern Christian Office|Sixth Hour]].

===Kairon===
{{main|Entrance prayers}}
{{further|Kairos}}

The [[priest]]s and [[deacon]]s celebrating the liturgy stand together in front of the [[Royal Doors|holy doors]] of the [[iconostasis]], [[veneration|venerate]] the [[icon]]s, and say special entrance prayers before they enter into the altar.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Among Eastern Christians, the entire sanctuary may be referred to as the "Altar"; the Altar Table itself being referred to as either the "Holy Table" or the "Throne."&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of these prayers, they bow to the throne of the [[bishop]] who oversees the church, or, if it is a monastery, the [[Hegumen|abbot]], acknowledging the authority of their spiritual superiors, without whose permission they may not celebrate the divine services.

===Vesting===
{{main|Vesting prayers}}

They then venerate the holy table and put on their [[vestment]]s. Before putting on each vestment the priest says a prayer, usually drawn from the [[Psalms]], bless the vestment, and kiss the cross that is sewn onto it. The deacon brings his vestments to the priest to bless and then kisses the priest's hand and withdraws to vest, saying the same prayers for the [[sticharion|sticharia]] as the priest and kissing the cross on each vestment. Each [[Subdeacon#The Eastern Rite|subdeacon]] and [[Altar server#Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches|server]] vesting bring his sticharion to the priest for him to bless, and then kisses the cross on it before vesting. If a bishop is present, the clergy bring their vestments for him to bless before putting them on.

After vesting, the priest and deacon wash their hands, saying the Prayer of the Washing of Hands (Psalm 26:6-12) They then go to the [[Prothesis (altar)|Prothesis]] (Table of Oblation) where the Gifts are to be prepared.

===Proskomedia===
If there are several priests concelebrating, usually only one&amp;mdash;traditionally, the most junior&amp;mdash; celebrates the Proskomedia. Others may assist in taking out particles for the living and the dead.  In the Greek traditions (Constantinople, Antioch, etc.) all particles are frequently taken from one large prosphoron which is stamped with a seal that serves as a template, but in the Slavic traditions there are several (usually five) prosphora, from which particles are taken as described below.

====The Lamb====
[[Image:Patene-byzantine.jpg|thumb|250px|the [[Lamb (Liturgy)|Lamb]] and particles placed on the [[diskos]]. The large triangle to the viewer's left of the Lamb is the particle for the Theotokos; to the right of the Lamb are the particles for the nine ranks (saints); below the Lamb are the particles commemorating the living and the departed.]]

The priest takes a [[prosphora|prosphoron]] and blessed it three times, making the sign of the cross over it with the liturgical [[spear (liturgy)|spear]]. Then, cutting on all four sides of the square seal on the prosphoron, he removes a [[cube]] (the Lamb), taking from both layers of the loaf, and places it in the center of the [[Paten#Byzantine-Rite Usage|diskos]]. He then cuts the underside of the Lamb, making a cross, then turns the Lamb right side up and pierces it with the spear, saying the words from the Gospel ({{bibleverse||John|19:34-35}}). (See [[Lamb (Liturgy)|Lamb]] for more details).

The deacon mingles a little water&lt;ref group=note&gt;This commemorates the fact that, when the soldiers pierced Christs' side with a spear, blood and water came forth.&lt;/ref&gt; with the wine that is poured in the chalice and presents it to the priest for him to bless. The deacon then pours the wine and water into the chalice, as the priest says, "Blessed be the union of Thy holy things, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages. Amen."

====The Theotokos====
Next the priest takes up the second prosphoron,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Greeks perform all of the same actions as the Russians, but they use only one loaf, removing all particles from the same loaf. The instructions here presume the celebrant is using five loaves.&lt;/ref&gt; blesses it with the spear, and cuts a large, triangular particle from it, which he places  on the diskos next to the Lamb&lt;ref group=note&gt;The particle for the Theotokos is placed to the Lamb's right (i.e., the celebrant's left, in remembrance of the Psalm vere, "The queen stood at the King's right hand."(Psalm 44:8).&lt;/ref&gt; in commemoration of the Theotokos. This loaf (if it is a separate loaf) is sometimes sealed with an icon of the Mother of God, or with her monogram.

====The ranks====
Next, the priest takes up the prosphoron of the Nine Ranks. From this loaf are taken smaller triangular particles in commemoration of the various ranks of [[saint]]s. There are some differences between the Greek and the Slavic texts as to which particular saints are named, but the intent is that all of the saints are included. Saint [[John the Baptist|John the Forerunner]] and the [[Patron Saint]] of the church or monastery are always named. The number nine was chosen because that is the traditional number of the ranks of [[angels]].

These nine particles are placed to the left of the Lamb (i.e., to the priest's right, as he looks down on the diskos).

====The living====
[[File:Ipodiakon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Subdeacon]] reading the names of the living and the departed during the Liturgy of Preparation.]]

Then the priest takes up the prosphoron for the Living. He takes out a larger particle in commemoration of the Patriarch (or Synod of Bishops), and a second larger particle in commemoration of the Ruler (in former times, this would have been the Emperor, but nowadays it reflects the government of the local nation in which the church is located). He then takes out smaller particles in commemoration of others among the living. He must always commemorate the Bishop who [[Ordination|ordained]] him (if he is still among the living), the clergy who are concelebrating with him, and any living Orthodox Christian whom he wishes. Churches and monasteries often have [[diptych]]s (memorial books) of the living and departed who should be commemorated at every Liturgy.

Among the Slavic peoples, it is customary for the laity to offer small prosphora in commemoration of those living and the departed whom they would like to have prayed for during the Liturgy. These often are smaller than the five prosphora used by the priest. They hand these to the priest together with their list of names, and he takes particles out (living from the top of the loaf, departed from the bottom) and place them on the diskos. The loaves are returned to the faithful.

All of the particles for the living are placed in a line below the Lamb and the particles for the Theotokos and saints.

Only Orthodox Christians may be commemorated on the diskos at the Proskomedia.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://antiochian.org/sites/default/files/Commemorations_during_Divine_Services.pdf COMMEMORATIONS DURING DIVINE SERVICES].'' Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America. Retrieved: 15 August, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The departed====
From the prosphoron of the departed the priest takes a larger particle as a general memorial of the departed [[hierarch]]s, rulers and the founders of the local church or monastery. He then takes out smaller particles in commemoration of departed Orthodox Christians. He commemorates the bishop who [[Ordination|ordained]] him (if he is departed) and any of the departed whom he will, as well as the names in the diptychs and those presented by the faithful.

All of the particles for the departed are placed in a line below the particles for the living.

Before the conclusion, any concelebrating priests who would like to make their own commemorations of the living and the departed may do so.

====The celebrant himself====

For the last commemoration, the priest takes out a particle for himself, saying: "Remember, O Lord, mine unworthy self, and pardon me every transgression, whether voluntary or involuntary."

====Conclusion====
[[Image:Aer on a Chalice and Discos.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[diskos]] and [[chalice (cup)|chalice]] covered by the [[Aër]] at the conclusion of the Proskomedie.]]

The deacon places incense in the censer and holds it up for the priest to bless. The priest blesses the incense saying the Prayer of the Censer. Next, the priest takes the [[Asterisk (liturgy)|Asterisk]] (star cover), holds it over the censer and then places it on the diskos, saying: "And the star came and stood over the place where the young child was."

He then holds each of the smaller [[veil]]s over the censer and places them on the discos and the chalice, respectively, saying appropriate prayers for each.

Then he takes the larger veil, called the [[Aër]], wraps it around the censer and then covers the chalice and diskos together.

Finally, he takes the censer from the deacon and [[incense|censes]] the covered Gifts. He then says the concluding Prayer of Offering (unless a bishop is celebrating; see below).&lt;ref&gt;See [[F. E. Brightman]] (1896), ''Liturgies Eastern and Western''&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, the deacon performs a full censing of the prothesis, the holy table, the sanctuary, the entire church and the people while he recites the following hymn and [[Psalm 51|Psalm 50]] quietly to himself:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb]] with the body, and in [[Hades]] with the soul, in [[Paradise]] with the [[Saint Dismas|thief]], and on the Throne with the [[God the Father|Father]] and the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit]], wast thou, O Christ, who art everywhere present and fillest all things.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Hierarchical Liturgy==
When a bishop is serving the divine liturgy, one of the priests and the deacons and lower clergy vest&lt;ref group=note&gt;Any other priests who are concelebrating do not vest until after the arrival of the bishop.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Liturgy of Preparation is performed as normal with a few omissions which are later performed by the bishop: the other clergy who are serving are not commemorated, the concluding Prayer of Offering is not said, and the offerings are not censed. When the liturgy neither immediately follows matins nor is in conjunction with vespers, the reading of the hours generally does not commence until after the arrival of the bishop.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Patriarchs or other bishops of high dignity arrive toward the end of the hours.&lt;/ref&gt;

When it is time, the bishop enters formally into the church and the deacons recite the Entrance Prayers and he is then vested by the [[subdeacon]]s while the deacons read the Vesting Prayers. Then the Reader begins the [[Little Hours]] or vespers commences or matins conclude, as the case may be.

During the great litany the bishop himself recites the Prayer of Offering omitted earlier from the usual order of the prothesis.

Just before the [[Great Entrance]], the bishop commemorates those whom he wishes, taking out particles from a special prosphoron that has been prepared for him. Then each priest, deacon, and server approaches the bishop and kissing the bishop's right shoulder says his own name, by which the bishop takes out a particle commemorating him. Finally, the bishop censes the offerings.

==Great Lent==
During [[Great Lent]] it is not permitted to celebrate the Divine Liturgy on weekdays. However, on Wednesdays and Fridays the faithful may receive Holy Communion from the reserved [[Sacrament|Mysteries]] (Sacrament) at the [[Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]]. In order to provide for these services, on the Sunday before, the priest must cut out extra Lambs each Presanctified Liturgy there will be that week.

==Pascha==
During [[Bright Week]] (The week following Easter Sunday) most of the services are quite radically different than during the rest of the year. However, at the Liturgy of Preparation, only the Entrance Prayers change; everything else remains the same.

==Oriental Orthodox==
The various [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]] also have Liturgies of Preparation before the commencement of the public portion of the Divine Liturgy.  `Some of these are very simple, and some are more complex. They all involve the entry of the clergy, vesting and preparing the Gifts of bread and wine, accompanied by appropriate prayers.

'''Macharomancy''' (Greek ''makhaira'', a short sword or a dagger, and ''manteia'', prophecy; alternative spellings are machæromancy, machairomancy) is a form of [[divination]] by interpreting [[knife|knives]], [[dagger]]s or [[sword]]s, one of many [[methods of divination]] based on the use of weapons (cf [[belomancy]] – by arrows, [[axinomancy]] – by axes, and other).

There are different methods of macharomancy.  Throughout the ages readers gazed into polished knives, daggers or sword blades, interpreted daggers flying and spinning, etc.

One of the most popular methods of macharomancy consists of placing a dagger in the center of the circle with letters and numbers.  Spirits are then asked a question, and a dagger is spun.  Each time it stops, a reader writes down the letter or number to which the blade points.  Spinning is repeated until the answer is spelled out, usually scambled or in an ancient language such as Latin or Greek.

Dagger divinations were very popular among [[Romani people|gypsies]].  Readers place a dagger onto a wooden board about 30 cm, normally used for cutting bread, and spin the dagger.  The board is divided into 15 sectors, with each sector having its own meaning.  The reader spins a dagger three times and interpret the answer depending on which sector the blade of the dagger points to.  One of these three answers (not necessarily the first) would be the answer to the question asked to spirits, while others may be interpreted in some connection to it or sometimes ignored.

The most common answers are below:
&lt;br&gt;
1.   Yes &lt;br&gt;
2.   No &lt;br&gt;
3.   Be patient &lt;br&gt;
4.   Beware of false friends &lt;br&gt;
5.   You will hear the good news soon &lt;br&gt;
6.   Wait for a letter &lt;br&gt;
7.   This venture will be successful &lt;br&gt;
8.   Unexpected guest &lt;br&gt;
9.   Love &lt;br&gt;
10.  Tears will turn to joy &lt;br&gt;
11.  News from afar &lt;br&gt;
12.  New admirer &lt;br&gt;
13.  Unexpected encounter &lt;br&gt;
14.  Travel &lt;br&gt;
15.  Important letter 

Another divination method, which was popular in Scotland, traditionally performed on August Eve (July 31st) to predict marriages and deaths of the following year consisted of throwing sickles (a semicircular blade attached to a short handle, used for cutting grain or tall grass) into the air and then drawing omens from the positions in which they fall.

==Historical revision==
The new nomenclature of ''Mahyavanshi'' was given to a large number of the Vankar community in South Gujarat&lt;ref name="shah"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dimensions of Social Life: Essays in Honor of David G. Mandelbaum |editor-first=Paul |editor-last=Hockings |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1987 |isbn=978-3-11084-685-0 |page=502 |first=A. M. |last=Shah |authorlink=A. M.

This was due largely to the efforts of [[K. M. Munshi]], then Home Minister of [[Bombay Presidency]], and Dr. Purshottam Solanki, representative of the Depressed Classes of Gujarat, who stressed that its members were descendants of ancient rulers known as Mayavats. Later, in 1968, after the [[1961 Indian annexation of Goa|Indian annexation of Daman]] from the Portuguese, the community in [[Daman and Diu|Daman]] were given the same status.&lt;ref name=Daman&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kumar Suresh Singh|author2=B.

In the 1930s-40s, many [[Dalit|depressed classes]] and communities were active in trying to change their caste name and elevate their social status to that of Rajput. These included the [[Khalpa]], who wanted to be known as ''[[Rohit (caste)|Rohit]]''desire to be known as ''Rishi'', as well as the Vankar claim to Mahyavanshi status. Of these, only the Mahyavanshi claim was successful in gaining official recognition from the [[British Raj]] administration.&lt;ref name="yagnik"/&gt; In some cases, they had a history of working as [[butler]]s for members of the various European [[East India Companies (disambiguation)|East India Companies]] in [[Surat]] since probably the 17th century&lt;ref name="shah"/&gt; and their success came because they were able to mobilise public opinion and procure support for their cause from both from British and Indian leaders and through books detailing their [[Invention of tradition|claimed history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Y. A. |last=Parmar |title=The Mahyavanshi: The Success Story of a Scheduled Caste |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GRR5aUwQUVsC&amp;pg=PA92 |year=1987 |publisher=Mittal Publications |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist [[A. M. Shah]] says that the Mahyavanshi "have an elaborate mythology, caste journals, and written "laws" to regulate the affairs of the caste".&lt;ref name="shah"/&gt;

A prominent figure in re-writing the history of the /Vankars was [[Makanji Kuber Makwana]], who wrote several works on their putative ancient history and genealogy that linked them to the Mahyavat [[Rajput]]s, a branch of the [[Parmara]] clan who had ruled in eastern [[Bengal]]. He is regarded as the spearhead of the "Mahyavat Rajput Movement", which was the name given to the campaign to "regain" their Rajput status.&lt;ref name="parmar86"&gt;{{cite book|first=Y.

These books included Makwana's ''Mayavat Rajput Prakash'' (1908) (A Light on Mayavat Rajputs), ''Mayavat Rajputoday'' (1911) (The Rise of Mayavat Rajput) and  ''Mahyavanshi Atle Shu?'' (1911) (Who is a Mahyavanshi?)&lt;ref name="yagnik"&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Takashi |editor-last=Shinoda |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KZNfS7mikMoC&amp;pg=PA27 |title=The Other Gujarat |first=Achyut |last=Yagnik |chapter=Search for Dalit Self Identity in Gujarat |page=27 |publisher=Popular Prakashan |year=2002 |isbn=978-8-17154-874-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Phakir Jeevan Mevashi]]'s ''Mayavat Ranshingu arthat Khudarano Karta''.

In a 1931 lecture, Munshi stressed that the Mahyavanshi were the descendants of the [[Heheya Kingdom|Hattiavanshi]] king [[Kartavirya Arjuna|Arjuna]], arguing that it was because of the slaughter of [[Parashurama]] that they had been relegated to a lower caste status.&lt;ref name="parmar87"&gt;{{cite book|first=Y.

Others involved in this affirming this identity were [[Garibdasji Ramdasji]] and other [[Mahant]]s of [[Ramanandi]] sect,  [[Phakir Jeevan Mevasi]], besides several of their community leaders spread across [[Bombay State]] (present day [[Maharashtra]] and [[Gujarat]]),  [[Sindh]] ( [[Karachi]] and [[Raban, Pakistan|Raban]] ), [[Portuguese India]] ( [[Daman district, India|Nani and Moti Daman]] ) and also from  [[South Africa]], where their population was living in cities like [[Johannesburg]] and  [[Pretoria]], who in unison impressed upon the government for revision of their social status.&lt;ref name=M/&gt;

==Subdivisions==
The Mahyavanshis are primarily divided into [[exogamy|exogamous]] clans like Mathariya, Aatekar Pardinar, Damania, Kantharia, Barodia, Chaseia, Surti, Kosadia, Khanvanshi, [[Parmar]], [[Rana (caste)|Rana]], [[Rathod]], Gohel, [[Solanki (clan)|Solanki]] ,Tawdia Vaghela,Makwana,Zala,Padaya,Maru.&lt;ref name=Daman/&gt;{{pn|date=April 2017}}

''' Rishi Marichi''' or '''Mareechi''' or '''Marishi''' (ṛṣi Marīci, ऋषि मरीचि) (meaning a ray of light) was the mindborn son of Brahma and one of the [[Saptarishi]]. He is also the father of [[Kashyapa]] and the grandfather of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s and [[Asuras]].

According to [[Jain]] [[Jain Agamas|scriptures]], he was the grandson of the first Jain ''[[tirthankara]]'' [[Rishabhanatha]] and son of [[Bharata Chakravartin]].He was the founder of [[Vedanta]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/tantra/maha/maha00.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He is referred to as one of the previous [[reincarnation]]s of the 24th [[Tirthankara]] [[Mahavira]].{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=21}}

==Saptarishi==
[[Saptarishi]], a [[Sanskrit]] [[dvigu]] meaning "seven sages" are the seven [[rishi]]s who are extolled at many places in the [[Veda]]s and [[Hindu]] literature. The Vedic Samhitas never enumerate these rishis by name, though later Vedic texts such as the [[Brahmanas]] and [[Upanisads]] do so. While earlier texts do not mention Marichi as one of the seven, references can be found in the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''. In some parts of India, people believe these are seven stars of the [[Big Dipper]] named "[[Vashista]]", "Marichi", "[[Pulastya]]", "[[Pulaha]]", "[[Atri]]", "[[Angiras (sage)|Angiras]]" and "Kratu". There is another star slightly visible within it, known as "[[Arundhati (Hinduism)|Arundhati]]". He is considered one among the seven great sages, the saptarishis.{{cn|date=April 2017}} Marichi, like some of the other sages, followed the path of worldly duties denouncing  total renunciation. He had many children, the notable being sage [[Kashyapa]]. Dharmavrata was one of the many consorts of the sage. Once she was cursed by the sage to become a stone for no fault of her. She pleaded innocence and proved it by immolating herself. Vishnu was pleased by her devotion. She requested Vishnu to revert her curse, but Vishnu said that the curse could not be reverted, but she would continue to be regarded as Devashila, which would be considered sacred in every Hindu house.&lt;ref name="sage" /&gt;

==Prajapathis==
Before the creation started, Brahma, the Hindu god of creation, needed a few people who can be held responsible for the creation of the remaining Universe.{{cn|date=April 2017}} Therefore, he is believed to have created ten [[Prajapatis]] (Ruler of the people) from his ''Manas'' (mind) and nine from his body. Marichi is one of the ''[[manasputra]]s'' of Brahma. The ten Prajapatis are as follows:&lt;ref name=Wilkins/&gt;

# Marichi
# [[Atri]]
# [[Angiras (sage)|Angirasa]]
# [[Pulaha]]
# [[Pulasthya]]
# [[Krathu]]
# [[Vasishta]]
# [[Prachethasa]]
# [[Bhrigu]]
# [[Narada]]

==Life==
The life of Marichi is known more by the account of his descendants, notably by the works of sage [[Kasyapa]]. Marichi is then married to Kala and gave birth to [[Kashyap]] (Kashyap is also sometimes acknowledged as a Prajapati, who has inherited the right of creation from his father).&lt;ref name=Wilkins&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Mythology|last=Wilkins|first=W.J.|page=370|publisher=D.K. Printworld (P) Limited|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-246-0234-4|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is believed to be formed out of the sustained energy of the Hindu god [[Vishnu]]. He is believed to have officiated the penance of [[Brahma]] at [[Pushkar]], found in modern-day [[Rajasthan]]. He is also believed to have visited [[Bhishma]] during [[Mahabharatha]], when he was lying on the arrow bed. Marichi is also quoted as the adviser of young [[Dhruva]] to pursue austerities. His name is featured in multiple Hindu scriptures like ''[[Brahmanda Purana]]'' and the ''[[Vedas]]''.&lt;ref name=sage&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient sages|pages=14-16|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|location=Mylapore, Chennai|last=Sathyamayananda|first=Swami|isbn=81-7505-356-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Krishna]] in the [[Bhagavad-Gita]] says, "''Of the [[Ādityas]] I am [[Vishnu]], of lights I am the radiant sun, of the [[Maruts]] I am Marici, and among the stars I am the moon.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhagavad-gita.us/categories/Chapter-Ten-of-the-Bhagavad-Gita/ Bhagavad Gita 10.21] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304082613/http://www.bhagavad-gita.us/categories/Chapter-Ten-of-the-Bhagavad-Gita/ |date=4 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jainism==
{{main|Mahavira}}
In Jain scriptures, Marichi was the son of [[Bharata Chakravartin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Confession: The Path to Self Liberation|url=|last=Suriji|first=Acharya Gunaratna|publisher=Jingun Aaradhak Trust|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who after many births was born as 24th [[Tirthankara]] of Jainism, [[Mahavira]].{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=21}} In his life as Marichi, he became a [[Jain monasticism|Jain monk]] following [[Rishabhanatha]], first tirthankara, but was unable to follow the hard rules of [[Digambara]] penance. So he took a robe, pedals and an umberalla and founded his own religion taking [[Kapila]] as his first disciple.

{{Buddhism}}
In [[Buddhist studies]], particularly East Asian Buddhist studies, '''post-canonical Buddhist texts''', '''Buddhist apocrypha''' or '''Spurious Sutras and Sastras''' designate texts that are not accepted as canonical by some historical Buddhist schools or communities who referred to a [[Tripitaka|canon]]. The term is principally applied to texts that purport to represent Buddhist teaching translated from Indian texts, but were written in East Asia.{{sfn|Muller|1998|p=63}}&lt;ref name="李学竹"&gt;李学竹.

The official religion in Bhutan [[Vajrayana Buddhism]]. Bhutan is a Buddhist country by constitution  and Buddhism play a vital role in the country. [[Buddhism]] is the cultural heritage of Bhutan and its people's identity as well. Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the King. Approximately 75 percent of the [[population]] of 770,000 follow either the [[Drukpa Lineage]] of the [[Kagyu]] school, the [[Nyingma]] school of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] or another school of [[Buddhism]]. The remaining 25 percent mainly Nepalis practice [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name=pew&gt;[http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/bhutan/religious_demography#/?affiliations_religion_id=0&amp;affiliations_year=2010 Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project: Bhutan]. [[Pew Research Center]]. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{main|Buddhism in Bhutan}}
The [[Ngalop people]], descendants of [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] immigrants, comprise the majority of the population in the western and central areas and mostly follow the Drukpa Lineage of Kagyu [[Vajrayana]].&lt;ref name=rf&gt;United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90227.htm Bhutan: International Religious Freedom Report 2007]. ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sharchops]], descendants of the country's probable original inhabitants, live in the east. Reportedly, some Sharchops practice Buddhism combined with elements of Bon whereas others practice [[animism]] and Hinduism. Several Sharchops hold high positions in the government, the [[National Assembly (Bhutan)|National Assembly]], and the court system.&lt;ref name=rf/&gt;

The government supports both Kagyu and Nyingma [[vihara|Buddhist monasteries]]. The royal family practices a combination of Nyingma and Kagyu Buddhism and many citizens believe in the concept of "Kanyin-Zungdrel," meaning "Kagyupa and Ningmapa as one."&lt;ref name=rf/&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{main|Hinduism in Bhutan}}
Hindus, mainly in the South, practice Hinduism. There are about 200,000 Hindus mainly ofclhotshampas ethnic  living in Bhutan and form 35% of the country population and it is the second largest religion of the nation. The very first  Hindu [[temple]] was constructed in [[Thimphu]] in 2012 by the Je Khenpo, Chief Abbot of Bhutan, and Hindus practice their religion in small to medium-sized groups.&lt;ref name=rf/&gt;
Hinduism is more common among the [[Lhotshampa]] ethnic group, although a fair amount of ethnic Lhotshampa also follow Buddhism as well.

==Bon==
{{main|Bon in Bhutan}}
[[Bon]], the country's animist and [[shaman]]istic belief system, revolves around the worship of [[nature]] and predates Buddhism. Although Bön [[priest]]s often officiate and include Bön rituals in Buddhist festivals, very few citizens adhere exclusively to this religious group.&lt;ref name=rf/&gt;

==Christianity==
{{main|Christianity in Bhutan}}
Christians are present in small numbers, especially in the Nepalese ethnic group. According to a 2007 report there were no Christian [[missionaries]] in the country, although international Christian relief organizations and Roman Catholic [[Jesuit]] priests engaged in education and humanitarian activities.&lt;ref name=rf/&gt;
Christianity was first brought to Bhutan in the late 17th century by Portuguese Jesuits, but the teachings failed to gain much traction among the devout Buddhists of the Bhutanese people.

==Islam==
{{main|Islam in Bhutan}}
0.2% of the population of Bhutan is Muslim. In 2010, the Pew Research Center estimated that 0.2% of the population were Muslims.&lt;ref name="pew2010"&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/files/2012/12/globalReligion-tables.pdf Pew Research Center - Global Religious Landscape 2010 - religious composition by country].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pew"/&gt;.

==Freedom and regulation of religion==
{{main|Freedom of religion in Bhutan}}

The law provides for freedom of religion; the religious institutions and personalities have a duty "to promote the spiritual heritage of the country while also ensuring that religion remains separate from politics" and that religious institutions and personalities remain "above politics."&lt;ref name=CoBE&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.constitution.bt/TsaThrim%20Eng%20(A5).pdf |title=The Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan |format=PDF |date=2008-07-18 |publisher=[[Government of Bhutan]] |accessdate=2010-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706162637/http://www.constitution.bt/TsaThrim%20Eng%20%28A5%29.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting the government's stated purpose of preserving individuals' religious and cultural values, the above prohibitive clauses in the Constitution have been interpreted to apply to proselytism and to prohibit religious personalities from voting, respectively.&lt;ref name=ROA07/&gt;&lt;ref name=pastor&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutannewsservice.com/main-news/pastor-sentenced-to-3-yrs-in-prison/ |title=Pastor sentenced to 3 yrs in prison |work=Bhutan News Service online |publisher=Bhutan News Service |date=2010-12-12 |accessdate=2011-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuenselonline.com/2010/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=16753 |work=[[Kuensel]] online |title=Chhoedey Lhentshog Lists Those Who Can Vote – Religious personalities above politics |date=2010-10-17 |accessdate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Religious Organizations Act of 2007 aims to protect and preserve the spiritual heritage of Bhutan through providing for the registration and administration of religious organizations. To meet those goals, the Act creates the Chhoedey Lhentshog as the regulatory authority on religious organizations. This body regulates, monitors, and keeps records on all religious organizations in Bhutan, which are in turn required to register and maintain specified [[corporate personhood|corporate formalities]].&lt;ref name=ROA07&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalcouncil.bt/images/stories/ReligiousOrg_En_07.pdf |title=Religious Organizations Act of Bhutan 2007 |format=PDF |date=2007-07-31 |publisher=[[Government of Bhutan]] |accessdate=2011-01-25 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through 2007, there were no reports of violence associated with pressure to conform to Vajrayana beliefs. There were no reports of societal abuse or [[discrimination]] based on religious belief or practice.&lt;ref name=rf/&gt;

[[Herb]]s are used in many [[religion]]s&amp;nbsp;– such as in [[Christianity]] ([[myrrh]] (''Commiphora myrrha''), ague root (''[[Aletris farinosa]]'') and [[frankincense]] (''Boswellia'' spp)) and in the partially Christianized [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Anglo-Saxon pagan]] [[Nine Herbs Charm]].  In [[Hinduism]] a form of [[basil]] called [[tulsi]] is worshipped as a [[Hinduism|goddess]] for its [[medicinal]] value since the [[Vedic period|Vedic]] times. Many Hindus have a Tulsi plant in front of their houses.

==Europe==
[[File:Mistletoe Postcard 1900.jpg|thumb|Mistletoe postcard, circa 1900]]

Herbs were also considered sacred in European pagan beliefs.

The best known example is the  [[mistletoe]]. The European mistletoe, ''Viscum album'', figured prominently in [[Greek mythology]], and is believed to be [[The Golden Bough (mythology)|The Golden Bough]] of [[Aeneas]], ancestor of the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The [[Norse mythology|Norse god]] [[Baldr]] was killed with mistletoe.

Mistletoe bears fruit at the time of the [[Winter solstice celebration|Winter Solstice]], the birth of the new year, and may have been used in solstitial rites in Druidic Britain as a symbol of immortality.  In [[Celtic mythology]] and in [[Druidry|druid]] rituals, it was considered a remedy for barrenness in animals and an antidote to poison, although the fruits of many mistletoes are actually poisonous if ingested as they contain [[viscotoxins]].

[[Verbena]] or Vervain has long been associated with [[Divinity|divine]] and other [[supernatural]] forces. It was called "tears of [[Isis]]" in [[ancient Egypt]], and later on "[[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]'s tears". In [[ancient Greece]], it was dedicated to [[Eos|Eos Erigineia]]. In the early Christian era, folk legend stated that [[Common Vervain]] (''V. officinalis'') was used to staunch [[Jesus]]' wounds after his removal from the [[crucifix|cross]]. It was consequently called "Holy Herb" or (e.g. in Wales) "Devil's bane". The [[name of a biological genus|generic name]] is the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] term for sacrificial herbs considered very powerful.  [[Pliny the Elder]] describes ''verbena'' presented on [[Jupiter]] altars; it is not entirely clear if this referred to a ''Verbena'' rather than the general term for prime sacrificial herbs.
&lt;!-- COPYVIO FROM VAMPIRE DIARIES: Other legends held it that vervain protects people from [[vampire]]s, by mixing it in a herbal tea, keeping it near you, or using oil extracted from it in a bath.--&gt;

Retrieved 2010-09-15.&lt;/ref&gt; in an extension of vervain's fabled magic-suppression powers against witches.  In ''The Struggle, Volume II'', the vampire Stefan instructs the human Elena that vervain can "protect you against bewitchment, and it can keep your mind clear if someone is using Powers against you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Struggle (Volume II) |first=L. J. |last=Smith |publisher=Harper Collins |year=1991 |page=105 |isbn=0-06-102001-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5R--5LXGOkC&amp;pg=PA145#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He tells her how it is prepared and used, "Once I've extracted the oil from the seeds, you can rub it into your skin, or add it to a bath. And you can make the dried leaves into a sachet and carry it with you, or put it under your pillow at night", but gives her an unprepared sprig for protection in the meantime.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1991), p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- "What if I said [it] could be used to make [...] herbal tea?", p. 140, was a hypothetical, not a declaration. --&gt;

Vervain flowers are engraved on ''[[cimaruta]]'', Italian  anti-''[[stregheria]]'' [[amulet|charm]]s. In the 1870 ''The History and Practice of Magic'' by "Paul Christian" ([[Jean-Baptiste Pitois]]) it is employed in the preparation of a [[Mandrake#Magic and witchcraft|mandragora]] charm:

{{pull quote|Would you like to make a Mandragora, as powerful as the [[homunculus]] (little man in a bottle) so praised by [[Paracelsus]]? Then find a root of the plant called [[bryony]]. Take it out of the ground on a Monday (the day of the moon), a little time after the vernal equinox. Cut off the ends of the root and bury it at night in some country churchyard in a dead man's grave. For thirty days water it with cow's milk in which three bats have been drowned. When the thirty-first day arrives, take out the root in the middle of the night and dry it in an oven heated with branches of [[verbena]]; then wrap it up in a piece of a dead man's winding-sheet and carry it with you everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Christian (1963), pp. 402–403&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other examples of sacred herbs include [[Valerian (herb)|valerian]], [[yarrow]], [[hemp]], and [[mugwort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Herbs: A -Z List: (...The Medicinal, Spiritual and Magical Uses of...)|url=http://www.ancient-wisdom.co.uk/herbsaz.htm|publisher=ancient-wisdom.co.uk|access-date=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Satnam''' ([[Gurmukhi]]:ਸਤਿ ਨਾਮੁ  ) is the main word that appears in the [[Sikh]] sacred [[scripture]] called the [[Guru Granth Sahib]]. It is part of the [[Gurbani]] [[Shabda|shabad]] called [[Mool Mantra]] which is repeated daily by all Sikhs. This word succeeds the word "[[Ik Onkar|Ek-onkar]]" which means "There is only one constant" or commonly "There is one God". The words ''[[Satya|sat]]'' means "true/everlasting" and ''[[Nāma|nam]]'' means "name".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaur Rait|first=Satwant|title=Sikh Women in England: Religious,Social and Cultural Beliefs [Paperback]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRfkTq1ykSIC&amp;pg=PA20|accessdate=11 November 2010|date=31 Jan 2005|publisher=Trentham Books Ltd; illustrated edition |isbn=1-85856-353-4|page=20|chapter=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this instance, this would mean, "whose name is truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nijhawan|first1=Michael|last2=Mandair |first2=Arvind|title=Shared idioms, sacred symbols, and the articulation of identities in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tbOLCZlymxYC&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=11 November 2010|date=20 Feb 2009|publisher=Routledge; 1st edition|isbn=0-415-95828-8 |page=66|chapter=2 The Politics of Non-duality: Unraveling the Hermeneutics of Modern Sikh Theology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satnam is referred to God as the Name of God is True and Everlasting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realsikhism.com/index.php?action=gmeaning&amp;glossaryid=64&amp;glossaryterm=Satnam Real Sikhism: Meaning of Term Satnam]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''nam'' in Sikhism has two meanings. "It meant both an application and a symbol of the All-pervading Supreme Reality that sustained the universe. [[Guru Nanak]] in his teachings emphasized the need of repeating Sat-Nam to realize the All-pervading Supreme Reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh Dhillon|first=Dalbir|title=Sikhism Origin and Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=osnkLKPMWykC&amp;pg=PA226|accessdate=12 November 2010|year=1988|publisher=Atlantic Publishers and Distributors|isbn= |page=226|chapter=3 Evolution of Institutions and Ethical Doctrines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shimenawa''' (標縄・注連縄・七五三縄, "enclosing rope") are lengths of laid [[rice]] [[straw]] or [[hemp]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.japantoday.com/smartphone/view/national/mie-govt-rejects-cannabis-cultivation-request-for-shinto-rituals&lt;/ref&gt; [[rope]] used for [[ritual purification]] in the [[Shinto]] religion. They can vary in diameter from a few centimetres to several metres, and are often seen festooned with ''[[Shide (Shinto)|shide]]''. A space bound by ''shimenawa'' often indicates a [[sacred]] or pure space, such as that of a [[Jinja (Shinto)|Shinto shrine]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Kasulis (2004:17-23).&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shimenawa'' are believed to act as a [[Magic (paranormal)|ward]] against [[evil]] spirits and are often set up at a [[groundbreaking|ground-breaking ceremony]] before construction begins on a new building. They are often found at Shinto shrines, ''[[torii]]'' gates, and sacred landmarks.

They are also used around ''[[yorishiro]]'' (objects capable of attracting spirits, hence inhabited by spirits). These notably include certain trees, in which case the inhabiting spirits are called ''[[Kodama (spirit)|kodama]],'' and cutting down these trees is thought to bring misfortune. In cases of stones, the stones are known as {{Nihongo||磐座、岩座|[[Iwakura (Shinto)|iwakura]]}}.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ojisanjake.blogspot.jp/2010/03/shimenawa-rock.html Shimenawa &amp; Rock]", ''[http://ojisanjake.blogspot.jp/ More glimpses of unfamiliar Japan],'' Thursday, March 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of the ''shimenawa'' is used in [[sumo wrestling]] by ''[[yokozuna (sumo)|yokozuna]]'' (grand champions) during their entrance ceremonies to denote their rank. This is because the ''yokozuna'' is seen as a living ''yorishiro'' (formally ''[[shintai]]''), and as such is inhabited by a spirit.

  __NOTOC__

'''Special revelation''' is a [[theology|theological]] term used mainly by evangelical scientists and Christian theologians which refers to the belief that knowledge of [[God]] and of spiritual matters can be discovered through [[supernatural]] means, such as [[miracle]]s or the [[scriptures]], a disclosure of God's truth through means other than through man's reason. The distinction between Special and [[General revelation]] was first elucidated in-depth by the Catholic [[systematic theologian]] [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] in his discussion of [[Revelation]]. This distinction was only then more widely disseminated by evangelical writers who emphasized its scriptural support (e.g. [[Psalm 19]]).

Evangelical theologians use the term "special revelation" for the belief in God's intervention to make God's will and knowledge available that would not otherwise be available through [[general revelation]]. They believe that disclosure of this "special revelation" is at specific times to specific persons, and believed by [[Christian theology|Christian Theologians]], to have been generally given through scripture, miracles, and through the person and ministry of Jesus Christ.

Other means by which God reputedly gave special revelation were by "divine voice or writing", "[[angel]]s", "[[prophet]]s", "visions" "[[dream]]s", "divine dictation", "[[Revelation|inspiration]]" and "Spirit's guidance or guidance from the [[Holy Spirit|Holy Ghost]]". When reviewing these examples, one can see that they refer to [[direct revelation]], which is now the third type of revelation, as a distinction between special revelation by way of "self-disclosure through the Bible" and personal communication from God, some forms of which include actually hearing the voice of God.

Special revelation is a contrast to [[general revelation]], which refers to the knowledge of God and spiritual matters which reputedly can be discovered through natural means, such as observation of nature, philosophy and reasoning, conscience or providence.  

The purpose of Special Revelation is to impart the knowledge and understanding of Jesus Christ, salvation and the atonement. Essentially it is knowledge and understanding, "that is requisite to salvation, that is, an explicit knowledge of Christ and his gospel."

The forms of special revelation as considered by [[mainstream Christianity]] are 
# Personal Experience
# Miracles
# Prophecy
# The Earthly Life of Jesus Christ
# The Scriptures (as a source of special revelation). In divine affairs, we are saved by the grace of Christ from our sins and guilt before God

'''Also''' the following is from Wikipedia Subj: '''Direct Revelation:''' "Direct revelation is classified as special revelation, but the word "direct" has come to make this type of revelation distinct."

'''''The Politics of Religious Apostasy: The Role of Apostates in the Transformation of Religious Movements''''' is a 1998 book edited by [[David G. Bromley]]. It presents studies by several sociologists of [[new religious movements]] on the role played by [[Apostasy|apostates]] (described as individuals that leave new religious movements to pursue opposition against their former group.) The volume examines the apostate's testimonies, their motivations, the [[narratives]] they construct to discredit their former movements, and their impact on the public controversy between such movements and society.

== Reception ==
''[[The Social Science Journal]]'' refers to the book as a "superb effort to examine in depth the complexity and significance of the apostate role, and to illuminate the processes through which subversive evil is socially constructed. Taken together, the authors contribute a diverse array of theory, data and substantive insights that add to our knowledge of the inner-workings of new religious movements. I recommend this book for classes in organizations, sociology of religion, psychology of religion, group dynamics and related subjects".&lt;ref&gt;'The Social Science Journal'', Elsevier; {{cite web |url=http://www.greenwood.com/books/printFlyer.aspx?sku=C5508|title=The Politics of Religious Apostasy|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was reviewed in the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'', that found this work to be a "remarkably unified collection of high-quality essays by many leading sociologists of new religious movements."&lt;ref&gt;William Sims Bainbridge, ''The American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 105, No. 1 (Jul., 1999), pp. 261-262&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist [[Michael Langone]] argues that some will accept uncritically the positive reports of current members without calling such reports, for example, "benevolence tales" or "personal growth tales".  He asserts that only the critical reports of ex-members are called "tales", which he considers to be a term that clearly implies falsehood or fiction.  He states that it wasn't until 1996 that a researcher conducted a study to assess the extent to which so called "atrocity tales" might be based on fact.&lt;ref&gt;Zablocki 1996 Zablocki, Benjamin, ''Reliability and validity of apostate accounts in the study of religious communities''.

[[Image:Chief Vestal.jpg|thumb|Roman statue of a ''[[#Vestalis Maxima|Virgo Vestalis Maxima]]'']]

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Rome]], the '''Vestals''' or '''Vestal Virgins''' ([[Latin]]: ''Vestālēs'', singular ''Vestālis'' {{IPA-la|wɛsˈtaːlɪs|}}) were [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|priestesses]] of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], [[List of Roman deities|goddess]] of the [[sacred fire of Vesta|hearth]]. The [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|College]] of the Vestals and its well-being were regarded as fundamental to the continuance and security of [[ancient Rome|Rome]]. They cultivated the sacred fire that was not allowed to go out. The Vestals were freed of the usual social obligations to marry and bear children and took a 30-year vow of [[chastity]] in order to devote themselves to the study and correct observance of state rituals that were forbidden to the colleges of male priests.&lt;ref&gt;For an extensive modern consideration of the Vestals, see {{cite book |author=Ariadne Staples |year=1998 |title=From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Priesthoods of ancient Rome}}
[[Livy]], [[Plutarch]], and [[Aulus Gellius]] attribute the creation of the Vestals as a state-supported [[College of pontiffs|priestesshood]] to king [[Numa Pompilius]], who reigned circa 717–673&amp;nbsp;BC. According to Livy, Numa introduced the Vestals and assigned them salaries from the [[aerarium|public treasury]]. Livy also says that the priestesshood of Vesta had its origins at [[Alba Longa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:20.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2nd&amp;nbsp;century [[antiquarian]] Aulus Gellius writes that the first Vestal taken from her parents was led away in hand by Numa. Plutarch attributes the founding of the [[Temple of Vesta]] to Numa, who appointed at first two priestesses; [[Servius Tullius]] increased the number to four.&lt;ref&gt;''Life of Numa Pompilius'' [http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/wlgr/wlgr-religion408.shtml 9.5–10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203060947/http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/wlgr/wlgr-religion408.shtml |date=2012-12-03 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ambrose]] alludes to a seventh in [[late antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/340918.htm |series=Letter to Emperor Valentianus |title=Letter&amp;nbsp;#18 |author=Ambrose |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022014112/http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/340918.htm |archivedate=2012-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numa also appointed the ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' to watch over the Vestals.

The first Vestals, according to [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], were named Gegania,&lt;ref&gt;English pronunciation: {{IPAc-en|dʒ|ᵻ|ˈ|ɡ|eɪ|n|i|ə}} {{respell|ji|GAY|nee|ə}}&lt;/ref&gt; Veneneia,&lt;ref&gt;{{IPAc-en|ˌ|v|ɛ|n|ᵻ|ˈ|n|iː|ə}} {{respell|VEN|i|NEE|ə}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canuleia,&lt;ref&gt;{{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|æ|nj|ʊ|ˈ|l|iː|ə}} {{respell|KAN|yuu|LEE|ə}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tarpeia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IPAc-en|t|ɑːr|ˈ|p|iː|ə}} {{respell|tar|PEE|ə}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarpeia, daughter of [[Spurius Tarpeius]], was portrayed as traitorous in [[Roman mythology|legend]].

The Vestals became a powerful and influential force in the Roman state. When [[Sulla]] included the young [[Julius Caesar]] in his [[proscription]]s, the Vestals interceded on Caesar's behalf and gained him pardon.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Julius Caesar'', 1.2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Augustus]] included the Vestals in all major dedications and ceremonies. They were held in awe, and attributed certain magical powers. [[Pliny the Elder]], for example, in Book&amp;nbsp;28 of his [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Natural History'']] discussing the efficacy of magic, chooses not to refute, but rather tacitly accept as truth:&lt;ref&gt;Pliny (1855), ''The Natural History of Pliny'', Volume&amp;nbsp;5, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NnRiAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA280 p.&amp;nbsp;280].&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|At the present day, too, it is a general belief, that our Vestal virgins have the power, by uttering a certain prayer, to arrest the flight of runaway slaves, and to rivet them to the spot, provided they have not gone beyond the precincts of the City. If then these opinions be once received as truth, and if it be admitted that the gods do listen to certain prayers, or are influenced by set forms of words, we are bound to conclude in the affirmative upon the whole question.}}
The [[Praefectus urbi|urban prefect]] [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]], who sought to maintain traditional Roman religion during the rise of Christianity, wrote:

{{quote|The laws of our ancestors provided for the Vestal virgins and the ministers of the gods a moderate maintenance and just privileges. This gift was preserved inviolate till the time of the degenerate moneychangers, who diverted the  maintenance of sacred chastity into a fund for the payment of base porters. A public famine ensued on this act, and a bad harvest disappointed the hopes of all the provinces ... it was sacrilege which rendered the year barren, for it was necessary that all should lose that which they had denied to religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ambrose of Milan |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ambrose_letters_02_letters11_20.htm#Letter17 |series=The Letters of Ambrose |title=The Memorial of Symmachus |publisher=Tertullian.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812230137/http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ambrose_letters_02_letters11_20.htm#Letter17 |archivedate=2012-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The College of the Vestals was disbanded and the sacred fire extinguished in 394, by order of the Christian emperor [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]]. [[Zosimus]] records how the Christian noblewoman [[Serena (Roman)|Serena]], a niece of Theodosius, entered the temple and took from the statue of the goddess a necklace and placed it on her own neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |others=transcribed by Roger Pearse |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/zosimus05_book5.htm |title=The New History |page=5:38 |author=Zosimus |website=Tertullian.org |accessdate=2012-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131191916/http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/zosimus05_book5.htm |archivedate=2013-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An old woman appeared, the last of the Vestals, who proceeded to rebuke Serena and called down upon her all just punishment for her act of impiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=The Curse of the Last Vestal |author=Melissa Barden Dowling |publisher=[[Biblical Archaeology Society]] |magazine=Archaeology Odyssey |date=January–February 2001 |volume=4 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zosimus, Serena was then subject to dreadful dreams predicting her own untimely death. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] would be inspired to write [[City of God (book)|''The City of God'']] in response to murmurings that the capture of Rome and the disintegration of its empire was due to the advent of the Christian era, and its intolerance of the old gods who had defended the city for over a thousand years.

===Vestalis Maxima===
The chief Vestal (''Virgo Vestalis Maxima'' or ''Vestalium Maxima'', "greatest of the Vestals") oversaw the efforts of the Vestals, and was present in the [[College of Pontiffs]]. The ''Vestalis Maxima'' Occia presided over the Vestals for 57&amp;nbsp;years, according to [[Tacitus]]. The last known chief vestal was [[Coelia Concordia]], who stepped down in 394 with the disbanding of the College of the Vestals.

The ''Vestalium Maxima'' was the most important of Rome's high priestesses. Although the [[Flamen Dialis|''Flaminica Dialis'']] and the [[rex sacrorum|''regina sacrorum'']] each held unique responsibility for certain religious rites, each came into her office as the spouse of another appointed priest, whereas the vestals all held office independently.

==Number of Vestals==
According to [[Plutarch]], there were only two Vestal Virgins when Numa began the College of the Vestals. This number later increased to four, and then to six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Plutarch |author-link=Plutarch |title=Life of Numa |translator1=Langhorne}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested by some authorities that a seventh was added later, but this is doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author2=Worsfold, T. |author1=Cato |title=History of the Vestal Virgins of Rome |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms of service==
The Vestals were committed to the priestesshood before puberty (when 6–10&amp;nbsp;years old) and sworn to [[celibacy]] for a period of 30&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lutwyche |first=Jayne |title=Ancient Rome's maidens – who were the Vestal Virgins? |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/18490233 |access-date=2012-11-23 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2012-09-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001062403/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/0/18490233 |archivedate=2012-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These 30&amp;nbsp;years were divided in turn into decade-long periods during which Vestals were respectively students, servants, and teachers.

After her 30-year term of service, each Vestal retired and was replaced by a new inductee. Once retired, a former Vestal was given a pension and allowed to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/wlgr/wlgr-religion408.shtml |title=Life of Numa Pompilius |author=Plutarch |at=9.5–10 |orig-year=2nd&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;C.E. |publisher=Stoa.org |access-date=2012-11-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203060947/http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/wlgr/wlgr-religion408.shtml |archivedate=2012-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pontifex Maximus, acting as the father of the bride, would typically arrange a marriage with a suitable Roman nobleman. A marriage to a former Vestal was highly honoured, and – more importantly in ancient Rome – thought to bring good luck, as well as a comfortable pension.

===Selection===
To obtain entry into the order, a girl had to be free of physical and mental defects, have two living parents and be a daughter of a free-born resident of Rome. From at least the mid-Republican era, the ''[[pontifex maximus]]'' chose Vestals between their sixth and tenth year, by lot from a group of twenty high-born candidates at a gathering of their families and other Roman citizens. Originally, the girl had to be of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] birth, but membership was opened to [[plebs|plebeian]]s as it became difficult to find patricians willing to commit their daughters to 30&amp;nbsp;years as a Vestal, and then ultimately even from the daughters of freedmen for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |article=Vestal Virgins |series=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Ultimate Reference DVD |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kroppenberg, Inge |title=Law, Religion and Constitution of the Vestal Virgins |journal=Law and Literature |volume=22 |issue=3 |year=2010 |pages=426–427}}. The earlier, stricter selection rules were determined by the Papian Law of the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century BCE; they were waived as suitable high-born candidates became hard to find. {{cite web |url=http://www.uni-r.de/Fakultaeten/Jura/kroppenberg/pdf/CV%20und%20Schriftenverzeichnis%20Kroppenberg/LAL2203_03-Vestal_Virgins.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425081258/http://www.uni-r.de/Fakultaeten/Jura/kroppenberg/pdf/CV%20und%20Schriftenverzeichnis%20Kroppenberg/LAL2203_03-Vestal_Virgins.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choosing ceremony was known as a ''captio'' (capture). Once a girl was chosen to be a Vestal, the ''pontifex'' pointed to her and led her away from her parents with the words, "I take you, Amata, to be a Vestal priestess, who will carry out sacred rites which it is the law for a Vestal priestess to perform on behalf of the Roman people, on the same terms as her who was a Vestal 'on the best terms'&amp;nbsp;" (thus, with all the entitlements of a Vestal). As soon as she entered the atrium of Vesta's temple, she was under the goddess's service and protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |contribution=Vestal Virgins |author=Aulus Gellius |author-link=Aulus Gellius |title=Attic Nights |volume=1 |page=12 |url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/wlgr/wlgr-religion408.shtml |publisher=STOA.org |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203060947/http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/wlgr/wlgr-religion408.shtml |archivedate=2012-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To replace a Vestal who had died, candidates would be presented in the quarters of the chief Vestal for the selection of the most virtuous. Unlike normal inductees, these candidates did not have to be prepubescents, nor even virgins (they could be young widows or even divorcees, though that was frowned upon and thought unlucky), though they were rarely older than the deceased Vestal they were replacing. Tacitus (Annals ii.86) recounts how [[Gaius Fonteius Agrippa]] and Domitius Pollio offered their daughters as Vestal candidates in 19&amp;nbsp;AD to fill such a vacant position. Equally matched, Pollio's daughter was chosen only because Agrippa had been recently divorced. The pontifex maximus ([[Tiberius]]) "consoled" the failed candidate with a dowry of 1&amp;nbsp;million [[sesterces]].

===Duties===
[[Image:RomaCasaVestaliDaPalatinoOvest.JPG|thumb|House of the Vestals and Temple of Vesta from the Palatine]]
Their tasks included the maintenance of the fire sacred to [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], the goddess of the hearth and home, collecting water from a sacred spring, preparation of food used in rituals and caring for sacred objects in the temple's sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |contribution=Vestal Virgins |series=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Ultimate Reference Suite |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; By maintaining Vesta's sacred fire, from which anyone could receive fire for household use, they functioned as "surrogate housekeepers", in a religious sense, for all of Rome. Their sacred fire was treated, in Imperial times, as the emperor's household fire.

The Vestals were put in charge of keeping safe the wills and testaments of various people such as [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] and [[Mark Antony]]. In addition, the Vestals also guarded some sacred objects, including the [[Palladium (mythology)|Palladium]], and made a special kind of flour called ''[[mola salsa]]'' which was sprinkled on all public offerings to a god.

===Privileges===
The dignities accorded to the Vestals were significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Land |first1=Graham |title=The Vestal Virgins: Rome’s Most Independent Women |url=http://madefrom.com/history/antiquity/the-vestal-virgins-romes-most-independent-women/ |access-date=17 February 2018 |newspaper=Made From History |date=30 March 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218091749/http://madefrom.com/history/antiquity/the-vestal-virgins-romes-most-independent-women/ |archivedate=18 February 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In an era when religion was rich in pageantry, the presence of the College of Vestal Virgins was required for numerous public ceremonies and wherever they went, were transported in a carpentum, a covered two-wheeled carriage, preceded by a [[lictor]], and had the right-of-way;
*At public games and performances they had a reserved place of honour;
*Vestals gave evidence without the customary oath, their word being trusted without question;
*Vestals were, on account of their incorruptible character, entrusted with important wills and state documents, like public treaties;

===Punishments===
[[File:Alessandro Marchesini - Dedication of a New Vestal Virgin - WGA14054.jpg|thumb|300px|Early 18th-century depiction of the dedication of a Vestal, by [[Alessandro Marchesini]]]]
Allowing the sacred fire of Vesta to die out was a serious dereliction of duty. It suggested that the goddess had withdrawn her protection from the city. Vestals guilty of this offence were punished by a scourging or beating, which was carried out "in the dark and through a curtain to preserve their modesty"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Culham, Phyllis |editor=Flower, Harriet I. |title=The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic |edition=2nd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2014 |page=143 |ISBN=9781107669420 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chastity of the Vestals was considered to have a direct bearing on the health of the Roman state. When they entered the ''[[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegium]]'', they left behind the authority of their fathers and became daughters of the state. Any sexual relationship with a citizen was therefore considered to be [[incestum]] and an act of treason.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Vestal Virgins – Chaste Keepers of the Flame |author=Melissa Barden Dowling |publisher=Biblical Archaeological Society |magazine=Archaeology Odyssey |date=January–February 2001 |volume=4 |issue=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment for violating the oath of celibacy was to be [[Premature burial|buried alive]] in the ''Campus Sceleratus'' ("Evil Field") in an underground chamber near the [[Porta Collina|Colline Gate]] supplied with a few days of food and water. Ancient tradition required that an unchaste Vestal be buried alive within the city, that being the only way to kill her without spilling her blood, which was forbidden. However, this practice contradicted the [[Roman law]] that no person might be buried within the city. To solve this problem, the Romans buried the offending priestess with a nominal quantity of food and other provisions, not to prolong her punishment, but so that the Vestal would not technically be buried in the city, but instead descend into a "habitable room". The actual manner of the procession to Campus Scleretatus has been described like this:
{{quote|When condemned by the college of pontifices, she was stripped of her vittae and other badges of office, was scourged, was attired like a corpse, placed in a close litter, and borne through the forum attended by her weeping kindred, with all the ceremonies of a real funeral, to a rising ground called the ''Campus Sceleratus'' just within the city walls, close to the Colline gate. There a small vault underground had been previously prepared, containing a couch, a lamp, and a table with a little food. The pontifex maximus, having lifted up his hands to heaven and uttered a secret prayer, opened the litter, led forth the culprit, and placing her on the steps of the ladder which gave access to the subterranean cell, delivered her over to the common executioner and his assistants, who conducted her down, drew up the ladder, and having filled the pit with earth until the surface was level with the surrounding ground, left her to perish deprived of all the tributes of respect usually paid to the spirits of the departed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Smith, Anthon |year=1846 |title=A school dictionary of Greek and Roman antiquities |location=London |publisher=Harper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PeYRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA353 |page=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cases of unchastity and its punishment were rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Vesta |volume=27 |page=1055}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 483&amp;nbsp;BCE, following a series of portents, and advice from the soothsayers that the religious ceremonies were not being duly attended to, the vestal virgin [[Oppia]] was found guilty of a breach of chastity and punished.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Livy |author=Livy |title=[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]] |at=2.42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vestal [[Tuccia]] was accused of [[fornication]], but she carried water in a [[wiktionary:sieve|sieve]] to prove her chastity.

[[File:Temple of Vesta - Hearth 01.jpg|thumb|The most prominent feature of the ruins that were once the Temple of Vesta is the hearth (seen here in the foreground).]]
Because a Vestal's virginity was thought to be directly correlated to the sacred burning of the fire, if the fire were extinguished it might be assumed that either the Vestal had acted wrongly or that the vestal had simply neglected her duties. The final decision was the responsibility of the [[Pontifex Maximus]], or the head of the pontifical college, as opposed to a judicial body. While the Order of the Vestals was in existence for over one thousand years there are only ten recorded convictions for unchastity and these trials all took place at times of political crisis for the Roman state. It has been suggested&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; that Vestals were used as scapegoats&lt;ref&gt;Since the health of city was perceived in some way to be linked to the purity and spiritual health of the vestals, suspicions may have been fueled in times of trouble. The allusions to a possible [[scapegoat]] could have been reinforced by the Vestals throwing [[Argei]] into the Tiber each year on May&amp;nbsp;15. cf. {{cite book |contribution=Religion of Ancient Rome |author=Martindale, C.C. |title=Studies in Comparative Religion |publisher=CTS |volume=2 |at=14:7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in times of great crisis.

[[Pliny the Younger]] was convinced that Cornelia, who as Virgo Maxima was buried alive at the orders of emperor [[Domitian]], was innocent of the charges of unchastity, and he describes how she sought to keep her dignity intact when she descended into the chamber:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Essay, part 2 |series=Some Observations on the Worship of Vesta |author=Noehden, G.H. |quote=[http://universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH15161&amp;type=P online biography of G.H.

==House of the Vestals==
[[Image:Casa-vestali.png|thumb|A reconstruction of the House of the Vestals by [[Christian Huelsen]] (1905)]]
{{Main|House of the Vestals}}
The House of the Vestals was the residence of the vestal priestesses in Rome. Behind the Temple of Vesta (which housed the sacred fire), the ''Atrium Vestiae'' was a three-story building at the foot of the [[Palatine Hill]].

==Vestal festivals==
The chief festivals of Vesta were the Vestalia celebrated June&amp;nbsp;7 until June&amp;nbsp;15. On June&amp;nbsp;7 only, her sanctuary (which normally no one except her priestesses the Vestals entered) was accessible to mothers of families who brought plates of food. The simple ceremonies were officiated by the Vestals and they gathered grain and fashioned salty cakes for the festival. This was the only time when they themselves made the ''[[mola salsa]]'', for this was the holiest time for Vesta, and it had to be made perfectly and correctly, as it was used in all public sacrifices.

==Attire==
Romans used clothes to express important aspects of their culture, specifically gender and sexuality. The implications of the attire of the Vestal Virgins emphasize the Roman principle of sexual propriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Beard, Mary |year=1995 |article=Re-reading (Vestal) Virginity |title=Women in Antiquity: New Assessments |editor1=Richard Hawley |editor2=Barbara Levick |location=London and New York |publisher=Routledge |pages=166–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout time, the image of the Vestal Virgin has been a woman draped in white priestly garments denoting the essence of purity and divinity through such attire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Kathryn|date=|title=The Power of Virginity: The Political Position and Symbolism of Ancient Rome's Vestal Virgin|url=http://www.wou.edu/history/files/2015/08/Kathryn-Wagner1.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517013907/http://www.wou.edu/history/files/2015/08/Kathryn-Wagner1.pdf|archivedate=2017-05-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The important elements of the Vestal costume include the ''[[stola]]'' and the ''vittae''. It is important to note that these two items are closely related to the traditional attire of Roman brides and the Roman matron, and therefore are not unique to the Vestals. The ''vittae'' that the Vestals wore was a cloth ribbon worn in the Vestals’ hair. It is closely associated with status of Roman matron. ''Vittae'' were worn by a wider range of woman at different stages of life and therefore cannot be accepted as unique to just one stage. Unmarried girls, matrons, as well as the Vestal virgins all wore them.

However, the Vestals did not share all elements of the bride’s attire, specifically they did not wear the ''flammeum'' that brides did, but instead wore the ''suffibulum''. The vestals also wore a ''stola'', which is associated with Roman matrons, not with Roman brides. Furthermore, the manner in which the Vestals styled their hair was the way that Roman brides wore their hair on their wedding day. This juxtaposition between the attire and style worn by Vestal Virgins and brides or matrons is particularly intriguing and studied by scholars in numerous instances.

The gowns worn by the Vestals and Roman brides were also similar in the way that they were tied. The distinction, though is that the Vestals wore the ''stola'', which is associated more with matrons, while brides were associated with the ''tunica recta''. The ''stola'' is a long gown that covers the body, and this covering of the body by way of the gown “signals the prohibitions that governed [the Vestals] sexuality.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gallia |first=Andrew B. |date=2014-07-01 |title=The Vestal Habit |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/676291 |journal=Classical Philology |volume=109 |issue=3 |pages=222–240 |doi=10.1086/676291 |issn=0009-837X}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stola'' literally communicates the message of “hands off” and further communicates their virginity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Beard |first=Mary |date=1980-01-01 |title=The Sexual Status of Vestal Virgins |jstor=299553 |journal=The Journal of Roman Studies |volume=70 |pages=12–27 |doi=10.2307/299553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection between Vestals and Roman brides suggest that the Vestals have the connotation of being ambivalent. They are perceived as eternally stuck at the moment between virginal status and marital status.

The main articles of their clothing consisted of an ''infula'', a ''suffibulum'', and a [[Palla (garment)|''palla'']]. The infula was a fillet, which was worn by priests and other religious figures in Rome. A vestal's infula was white and made from wool. The suffibulum was the white woolen veil which was worn during rituals and sacrifices. Usually found underneath were red and white woolen ribbons, symbolizing the Vestal's commitment to keeping the fire of Vesta and to her vow of purity, respectively. The palla was the long, simple shawl, a typical article of clothing for Roman women. The palla, and its pin, were draped over the left shoulder.

Vestals also had an elaborate hairstyle consisting of six or seven braids, which Roman brides also wore.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] 454 in the edition of Lindsay, as cited by Robin Lorsch Wildfang, ''Rome's Vestal Virgins: A Study of Rome's Vestal Priestesses in the Late Republic and Early Empire'' (Routledge, 2006), p.&amp;nbsp;54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laetitia La Follette, "The Costume of the Roman Bride," in ''The World of Roman Costume'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2001), pp.&amp;nbsp;59–60 (on discrepancies of hairstyles in some Vestal portraits)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Recreating the Vestal Virgin Hairstyle" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epz7n8uYXQY video.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213203744/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epz7n8uYXQY |date=2016-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324900204578286272195339456|title=On Pins and Needles: Stylist Turns Ancient Hairdo Debate on Its Head|first=Abigail|last=Pesta|date=7 February 2013|publisher=|accessdate=7 May 2018|via=www.wsj.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406064643/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324900204578286272195339456|archivedate=6 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 [[Janet Stephens]] became the first to recreate the hairstyle of the vestals on a modern person.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/50417111/ns/technology_and_science-science/#.UTYf91fYREc|title=Ancient Rome's hairdo for vestal virgins re-created|author=|date=10 January 2013|website=nbcnews.com|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102081812/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/50417111/ns/technology_and_science-science#.UTYf91fYREc|archivedate=2 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of Vestals==
From the institution of the Vestal priesthood to its abolition, an unknown number of Vestals held office. Several are named in Roman myth and history.

===Legendary Vestals===
*'''[[Rhea Silvia]]''', the mythical mother of Rome's founders, [[Romulus and Remus]].
*'''Aemilia''', who, when the [[Sacred fire of Vesta|sacred fire]] was extinguished on one occasion, prayed to Vesta for assistance, and miraculously rekindled it by throwing a piece of her garment upon the extinct embers.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysus of Halicarnassus, book&amp;nbsp;II, 68, 3: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/2C*.html Loeb edition available at Thayer, chicago.edu]: [[Valerius Maximus]], I.1.§7&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vestals in the Republic (509–27 BCE) ===

* '''[[Oppia]]''' was a Vestal Virgin in the early republic.  In 483, following a series of portents, and advice from the soothsayers that the religious ceremonies were not being duly attended to, she was found guilty of a breach of chastity and punished.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
*'''Orbinia''', put to death for misconduct in 471.&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, ix. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Postumia''', tried for misconduct in 420, but acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, iv. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Minucia''', put to death for misconduct in 337.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, viii. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Sextilia''', put to death for misconduct in 273.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''Periochae'', 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Caparronia''', committed suicide in 266 when accused of misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;Orosius, iv. 5 § 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Tuccia]]''', accused of misconduct, perhaps in 230, she proved her innocence.&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Maximus, viii.1 § 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, vol. I, pp. 227, 228 (note 2).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Floronia''', '''Opimia''', convicted of misconduct in 216, one was burried alive, the other committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, xxii. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Claudia Ap. f. Ap. n.''', daughter of [[Appius Claudius Pulcher (consul 143 BC)|Appius Claudius Pulcher]], consul in 143.  During the triumph of her father, she walked besides him to repulse a tribune of the plebs, who was trying to veto his triumph.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Pro Caelio'', 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Licinia C. f.''', vestal in 123, her dedication of an altar was cancelled by the pontiffs because it had been done without the approval of the people.  She was possibly the same as the vestal executed for misconduct in 113.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Pro Domo Sua'', 136.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Aemilia''', '''Marcia''', and '''Licinia''', accused of multiple acts of ''[[incestum]]'' (violations of their vows of chastity) in 114. Aemilia, who had supposedly led the two others to follow her example, was condemned outright and put to death. Marcia, who was accused of only one offence, and Licinia, who was accused of many, were at first acquitted by the [[pontifex|pontifices]], but were retried by the [[praetor]] and jurist [[Lucius Cassius Longinus Ravilla]] (consul 127), and condemned to death in 113.&lt;ref&gt;Wildfang, Robin Lorsch, ''Rome's vestal virgins: a study of Rome's vestal priestesses in the late Republic and early Empire'', Routledge/Taylor &amp; Francis, 2007, p. 93ff [https://books.google.com/books?id=eYetrQctq04C&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=wildfang,+robin+lorsch.+%22rome%27s+vestal+virgins%22.+oxford:+routledge&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RGTYTOPdD4bvsgbW3p2NCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Bona%20Dea&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution offered two [[Sibylline books|Sibylline prophecies]] in support of the final verdicts.

Now Licinia was the owner of a pleasant villa in the suburbs which Crassus wished to get at a low price, and it was for this reason that he was forever hovering about the woman and paying his court to her, until he fell under the abominable suspicion. And in a way it was his avarice that absolved him from the charge of corrupting the Vestal, and he was acquitted by the judges. But he did not let Licinia go until he had acquired her property."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Plutarch |author-link=Plutarch |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html |title=Life of Crassus |publisher=University of Chicago |date= |access-date=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Licinia became a Vestal in 85 and remained a Vestal until 61.
*'''Arruntia''', '''Perpennia M. f.''', '''Popillia''', attended the inauguration of Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Niger as Flamen Martialis in 69.  Licinia, Crassus' relative, was also present.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, vol. II, pp. 135-137 (note 14).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Occia''', vestal for 57 years between 38 BCE and 19 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, vol. II, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial Vestals===
*[[Rubria]], said by [[Suetonius]] to have been raped by [[Nero]]
*[[Aquilia Severa]], whom Emperor [[Elagabalus]] married amid considerable scandal.
*[[Coelia Concordia]], the last head of the order.

===Outside Rome===
Inscriptions record the existence of Vestals in other locations than the centre of Rome.
* Manlia Severa, ''virgo Albana maxima'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' XIV 2140 = ''[[Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae|ILS]]'' 6190, found in 1728 at the XI&amp;nbsp;mile of the [[Via Appia]], now in the Lapidary Gallery of the Vatican Museums: it mentions the dedication of a [[clipeus]] by her brother.&lt;/ref&gt; a chief Alban Vestal at [[Bovillae]] whose brother was probably the L. Manlius Severus named as a ''[[rex sacrorum]]'' in a funerary inscription. Mommsen thought he was ''rex sacrorum'' of Rome, view that is now not considered probable.&lt;ref&gt;CIL XIV 2413 = ILS 4942 presently no longer reperible in the palazzo Mattei in Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flavia (or Valeria) Vera, a ''virgo vestalis maxima arcis Albanae'', chief Vestal Virgin of the Alban [[Arx (Roman)|''arx'' (citadel)]].&lt;ref&gt;''CIL'' VI 2172 = ''ILS'' 5011, found in Rome near the basilique of St. Saba, now in the Lapidary Gallery of the Vatican Museum. It is a dedicatory inscription on a little base, possibly of a statuette that was housed in the home of the same vestal on the Little Aventine. M. G. Granino Cecere "Vestali non di Roma" in ''Studi di epigrafia latina'' '''20''' 2003 p. 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Caecilia Philete, a senior virgin ''(virgo maior)'' of [[Laurentum]]-[[Lavinium]],&lt;ref&gt;''Virgo maior regia Laurentium Lavinatium'', ''CIL'' XIV 2077, as read by [[Pirro Ligorio]], now housed in the Palazzo Borghese at Pratica di Mare. Cecere above p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; as commemorated by her father, Q. Caecilius Papion. The title ''maior'' means at Lavinium the Vestals were only two.
*Saufeia Alexandria, ''virgo Vestalis Tiburtium''.&lt;ref&gt;CIL XIV 3677 = ILS 6244 on the base of an honorary statue, now irreperible. Possibly also mentioned in CIL XIV 3679a. Cecere above p. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cossinia L(ucii) f(iliae), a ''Virgo Vestalis'' of Tibur (Tivoli).&lt;ref&gt;Inscr. It. IV n. 213. Inscription on funerary monument discovered at Tivoli in July 1929. On the front the name of the Vestal is incised within an oak wreath onto which adheres the sacred ''infula'', knot of the order; with the name of  the dedicant (L. Cossinius Electus, a relative, probably brother or nephew) on the lower margin. Cecere above p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Primigenia, Alban vestal of Bovillae, mentioned by [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus|Symmachus]] in two of his letters.

==Vestals in Western art==
The Vestals were used as models of female virtue in [[allegory|allegorizing]] portraiture of the later West. [[Elizabeth I]] of England was portrayed holding a sieve to evoke [[Tuccia]], the Vestal who proved her virtue by carrying water in a sieve.&lt;ref&gt;Marina Warner, ''Monuments and Maidens: The Allegory of the Female Form'' (University of California Press, 1985), p. 244 ; Robert Tittler, "Portraiture, Politics and Society," in ''A Companion to Tudor Britain'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 454; Linda Shenk, ''Learned Queen: The Image of Elizabeth I in Politics and Poetry'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2010), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuccia herself had been a subject for artists such as [[Jacopo del Sellaio]] (d. 1493) and [[Stradanus|Joannes Stradanus]], and women who were arts patrons started having themselves painted as Vestals.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, ''Monuments and Maidens,'' p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[libertine]] environment of 18th century France, portraits of women as Vestals seem intended as fantasies of virtue infused with ironic eroticism.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Nicholson, "The Ideology of Feminine 'Virtue': The Vestal Virgin in French Eighteenth-Century Allegorical Portraiture," in ''Portraiture: Facing the Subject'' (Manchester University Press, 1997), p. 58ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Later vestals became an image of republican virtue, as in [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[The Vestal Virgin (David)|The Vestal Virgin]]''. The discovery of a "House of the Vestals" in [[Pompeii]] made the Vestals a popular subject in the 18th century and the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The '''Wesleyan Holiness Church''' is a [[Christian]] [[Denomination (Christianity)|denomination]] which describes itself as [[evangelical]] [[protestant]] and "has its roots in [[John Wesley]]'s [[Methodism]]". It sits within the [[Holiness movement]] which emerged from Methodism during the nineteenth century.

In the UK, the British Isles District has 16 churches. The head office is at New Life Wesleyan Church in [[Handsworth, Birmingham]].

{{History of China|BC=1}}
The '''White Lotus''' ({{zh|t=白蓮教 |s=白莲教|p=Báiliánjiào|w=Pai-lien chiao}}) was a religious and political movement that appealed to many [[Han Chinese]] who found solace in worship of [[Wusheng Laomu]] ("Unborn Venerable Mother" ({{zh|t=無生老母|s=无生老母}})), who was to gather all her children at the millennium into one family.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

The doctrine of the White Lotus included a forecast of the imminent advent of the future Buddha, [[Maitreya]].

== Origins ==
The White Lotus originated as a hybrid movement of [[Dharmic]] [[Religion in China|Chinese religions]]; such as [[Benzhuism]], [[Bimoism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucism]], [[Dongbaism]], [[Mohism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Wuism]]; and [[Gnostic]] [[Assyrian religion|Assyrian religions]]; such as [[Manichaeism]], [[Mandaeanism]], [[Sabianism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]]; that emphasised strict vegetarianism and permitted men and women to interact freely, which was socially shocking. Like other secret societies such as the [[Boxers (group)|Boxers]], they covered up their unusual or illicit activities as "incense-burning ceremonies".{{sfn|Teng|1958|p=94}} The first signs of the White Lotus Society came during the late thirteenth century. Mongol rule over China, the [[Yuan dynasty]], prompted small yet popular demonstrations against its rule. The White Lotus Society took part in some of these protests as they grew into widespread dissent.{{sfn|Mote|2003|p=529}}

The Mongols considered the White Lotus society a heterodox religious sect and banned it, forcing its members to go underground. Now a secret society, the White Lotus became an instrument of quasi-national resistance and religious organization. This fear of secret societies carried on in the law; the [[Great Qing Legal Code]], which was in effect until 1912, contained the following section:
{{quote|[A]ll societies calling themselves at random White Lotus, communities of the Buddha Maitreya, or the Ming ts'un religion (Manichaeans), or the school of the White Cloud, etc., together with all who carry out deviant and heretical practices, or who in secret places have prints and images, gather the people by burning incense, meeting at night and dispersing by day, thus stirring up and misleading people under the pretext of cultivating virtue, shall be sentenced.{{sfn|Flower|1976|p=4}}}}

== White Lotus Revolution ==
{{Main article|Red Turban Rebellion}}

The White Lotus was a fertile ground for fomenting rebellion.
{{quote|The White Lotus doctrines and religious observances, particularly their "incense burning" ceremonies which in the popular mind came to typify them, merged with the doctrines and rituals of the Maitreyan sectarians; that produced a cohering ideology among rebel groups, uniting them in common purpose and supplying discipline with which to build a broad movement, recruit armies, and establish civil governing.{{sfn|Mote|2003|pp=529-30}}}}
A Buddhist monk from [[Jiangxi]] named Peng Yingyu began to study the White Lotus and ended up organising a rebellion in the 1330s. Although the rebellion was put down, Peng survived and hid in [[Anhui]], then reappeared back in South China where he led another unsuccessful rebellion in which he was killed. This second rebellion changed its colors from white to red and its soldiers were known as the "Red Turbans" for their red bandanas.

Another revolution inspired by the White Lotus society, took shape in 1352 around [[Guangzhou]]. A Buddhist monk and former boy-beggar, [[Hongwu Emperor|Zhu Yuanzhang]], joined the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor Purcell|title=The Boxer Uprising: A Background Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MeUoD9G9xAC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=mendicant+monk+manichee&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRgdqUv_jLAhVB9h4KHVnTBiUQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mendicant%20monk%20manichee&amp;f=false|date=3 June 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-14812-2|pages=149–}}&lt;/ref&gt; His exceptional intelligence took him to the head of a rebel army; he won people to his side by forbidding his soldiers to pillage in observance of White Lotus religious beliefs. By 1355 the rebellion had spread through much of China.

In 1356, Zhu Yuanzhang captured the important city of [[Nanjing]] (then called ''Jiqing'') and made it his capital, renaming it ''Yingtian'' {{lang|zh|應天}}. It was here that he began to discard his heterodox beliefs and so won the help of Confucian scholars who issued pronouncements for him and performed rituals in his claim of the [[Mandate of Heaven]], the first step toward establishing new dynastic rule.

Meanwhile, the Mongols were fighting among themselves, inhibiting their ability to suppress the rebellion. In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang extended his rule to Guangzhou, the same year that the Mongol ruler, [[Toghon Temür]], fled to [[Karakorum]]. In 1368, Zhu Yuanzhang and his army entered the former capital of Beijing and in 1371 his army moved through [[Sichuan]] to the southwest.

By 1387, after more than thirty years of war, Zhu Yuanzhang had liberated all of China. He took the title Hongwu Emperor and founded the [[Ming dynasty]], whose name echoes the religious sentiment of the White Lotus.

== Later rebellions ==
{{Main article|White Lotus Rebellion}}
The White Lotus reemerged in the late 18th century in the form of an inspired Chinese movement in many different forms and sects.

One such large-scale rebellion was led by the female warriors, [[Wang Cong'er]] and [[Wang Nangxian]].

In 1774, the [[herbalism|herbalist]] and martial artist [[Wang Lun]] founded a derivative sect of the White Lotus that promoted underground meditation teachings in [[Shandong]] province, not far from Beijing near the city of Linqing.{{sfn|Spence|1991}} The sect led an uprising that captured three small cities and laid siege to the larger city of [[Linqing]], a strategic location on the north-south Grand Canal transportation route. After initial success, he was outnumbered and defeated by Qing troops, including local armies of Chinese soldiers known as the [[Green Standard Army]].{{sfn|Spence|1991}}

An account of Wang Lun's death was given to Qing authorities by a captured rebel.{{sfn|Spence|1991}} Wang Lun remained sitting in his headquarters wearing a purple robe and two silver bracelets while he burned to death with his dagger and double-bladed sword beside him.{{sfn|Spence|1991}}

Wang Lun likely failed because he did not make any attempts to raise wide public support. He did not distribute captured wealth or food supplies, nor did he promise to lessen the tax burden. Unable to build up a support base, he was forced to quickly flee all three cities that he attacked in order to evade government troops. Though he passed through an area inhabited by almost a million peasants, his army never measured more than four thousand soldiers, many of whom had been forced into service.

Beginning in 1794, two decades after Wang Lun's failed uprising, a movement also arose in the mountainous region that separates Sichuan from [[Hubei]] and [[Shaanxi]] in central China as tax protests. Here, the White Lotus led impoverished settlers into rebellion, promising personal salvation in return for their loyalty. Beginning as tax protests, the eventual rebellion gained growing support and sympathy from many ordinary people. The rebellion grew in number and power and eventually, into a serious concern for the government.

A systematic program of pacification followed in which the populace was resettled in hundreds of stockaded villages and organized into militia. In its last stage, the Qing suppression policy combined pursuit and extermination of rebel guerrilla bands with a program of amnesty for deserters. The rebellion came to an end in 1804. A decree from the [[Daoguang Emperor]] admitted, "it was extortion by local officials that goaded the people into rebellion..." Using the arrest of sectarian members as a threat, local officials and police extorted money from people. Actual participation in sect activities had no impact on an arrest; whether or not monetary demands were met, however, did.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the first decade of the nineteenth century, there were also several White Lotus sects active in the area around the capital city of Peking. [[Lin Qing]], another member of the Eight Trigrams sect within the White Lotus, united several of these sects and with them build an organization that he would later lead in the [[Eight Trigrams Uprising of 1813]].{{sfn|Naquin|1976}}

Administrators also seized and destroyed sectarian scriptures used by the religious groups. One such official was [[Huang Yupian]] ({{lang|zh|黃育楩}}), who refuted the ideas found in the scriptures with orthodox Confucian and Buddhist views in ''A Detailed Refutation of Heresy'' ({{lang|zh|破邪詳辯}} ''Pōxié Xiángbiàn''), which was written in 1838. This book has since become an invaluable source in understanding the beliefs of these groups.

White Lotus adherents who collaborated with the Japanese during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] were fought against by the Muslim General [[Ma Biao (general)|Ma Biao]].&lt;ref&gt;http://military.china.com/zh_cn/dljl/krzz/01/11044207/20080919/15096066.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=April 2016}}

=== Uses of the term "White Lotus" in later periods ===
While traditional historiography has linked many Maitreyist and millenarian uprisings during the Ming and [[Qing dynasty|Qing dynasties]] as all related to the White Lotus, there are reasons to doubt that such connections existed. B J Ter Haar has argued that the term "White Lotus" became a label applied by late Ming and Qing imperial bureaucrats to any number of different popular uprisings, millenarian societies or "magical" practices such as mantra recitation and divination.{{sfn|Ter Haar|1992|p=242}} If this interpretation is correct, the steady rise in the number of White Lotus rebellions in imperial histories during the Ming and Qing does not necessarily reflect the increasing strength of a unified organization. Instead, this trend reflects a growing concern by imperial bureaucrats with any form of Buddhism practiced outside of the sanctioned frameworks of the monasteries.{{sfn|Ter Haar|1992|p=242}}

The White Lotus sect may have been one of the main ancestors of the Chinese organizations known as the [[Triad (organized crime)|Triads]]. The Triads were originally members and soldiers of the [[Tiandihui]] or "Heaven and Earth Society" during the period of the war between the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Triads' formation was not for criminal purposes, but to overthrow the Qing and restore the Ming to power. The White Lotus Society may have been one of five branches of the Heaven Earth Society which formed at the [[Shaolin Monastery]] from Ming loyalists. The Five branches, known by some as the "Five Ancestors", were the Black, Red, White, Yellow and Green Lodges. After there was no longer any need for the triads on the battlefield, some high-level military leaders resorted to criminal activity in order to find means of survival.
