In [[politics]], the term '''base''' refers to a group of [[voter]]s who almost always support a single [[political party|party]]'s candidates for [[election|elected]] office. Base voters are very unlikely to vote for the candidate of an opposing party, regardless of the specific views each candidate holds. In the [[United States]], this is typically because high-level candidates must hold the same stances on key issues as a party's base in order to gain the party's [[nomination]] and thus be guaranteed [[ballot access]]. In the case of [[legislature|legislative elections]], base voters often prefer to support their party's candidate against an otherwise appealing opponent in order to strengthen their party's chances of gaining a [[majority|simple majority]]; typically the gateway to overarching power in a legislature.

The '''Bosnian language''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Bosnian.ogg|ˈ|b|ɒ|z|n|i|ə|n}}; ''bosanski'' / босански {{IPA-sh|bɔ̌sanskiː|}}) is the [[standard language|standardized]] [[Variety (linguistics)#Standard varieties|variety]] of [[Serbo-Croatian]] mainly used by [[Bosniaks]].&lt;ref&gt;David Dalby, ''Linguasphere'' (1999/2000, Linguasphere Observatory), p. 445, 53-AAA-g, "Srpski+Hrvatski, Serbo-Croatian".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin V.

Bosnian uses both the [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic alphabet]]s,&lt;ref group="Note" name="Cyrillic-note" /&gt; with Latin in everyday use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tomasz Kamusella|title=The Politics of Language and Nationalism in Modern Central Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzEqAQAAIAAJ|date=15 January 2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-55070-4|quote=In addition, today, neither Bosniaks nor Croats, but only Serbs use Cyrillic in Bosnia.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable among the [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of Serbo-Croatian for a number of [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] loanwords, largely due to the language's interaction with those cultures through [[Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Islamic]] ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Persian Literature in Bosnia-Herzegovina |last=Algar |first=Hamid |authorlink= |date=2 July 1994 |work=Journal of Islamic Studies |location=Oxford |isbn= |pages=254–68 |accessdate=August 12, 2012 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Die Kultur der Bosniaken, Supplement I: Inventar des bosnischen literarischen Erbes in orientalischen Sprachen |last=Balić |first=Smail |authorlink= |year=1978 |publisher=Adolf Holzhausens, Vienna |location=Vienna |isbn= |page= |pages=111 |accessdate=August 12, 2012 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Das unbekannte Bosnien: Europas Brücke zur islamischen Welt |last=Balić |first=Smail |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Bohlau |location= Cologne, Weimar and Vienna |isbn= |page= |pages=526 |accessdate=August 12, 2012 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosnian is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian, [[Shtokavian dialect|Shtokavian]], more specifically on [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect|Eastern Herzegovinian]], which is also the basis of Standard [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], and [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]. Until the dissolution of [[SFR Yugoslavia]], they were treated as a unitary Serbo-Croatian language, and that term is still used in English to subsume the common base (vocabulary, grammar and syntax) of what are today officially four national standards, although this term is [[Serbo-Croatian#History of linguistic issues|controversial]] for native speakers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/Serbian_Croatian_Bosnian_or_Montenegrin_Many_In_Balkans_Just_Call_It_Our_Language_/1497105.html Radio Free Europe – Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Or Montenegrin? Or Just 'Our Language'?] Živko Bjelanović: Similar, But Different, Feb 21, 2009, accessed Oct 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and paraphrases such as "Serbo-Croato-Bosnian" (SCB) or "Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian" (BCS) are therefore sometimes used instead, especially in diplomatic circles.

Although Bosnians are, at the level of colloquial [[idiom]], linguistically more homogeneous than either Serbians or Croatians, unlike those nations they failed to codify a standard language in the 19th century, with at least two factors being decisive:

*The Bosnian elite, as closely intertwined with Ottoman life, wrote predominantly in foreign (Turkish, Arabic, Persian) languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ghb.ba/index.php/en/about-us/new-building/61-english/about-us/colletcions|title = Collection of printed books in Arabic, Turkish and Persian|date = 2014-05-16|accessdate = 2014-05-16|website = Gazi Husrev-begova biblioteka|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vernacular literature]] written in Bosnian with the [[Arebica]] script was relatively thin and sparse.
*The Bosnians' national emancipation lagged behind that of the Serbs and Croats, and because denominational rather than cultural or linguistic issues played the pivotal role, a Bosnian language project did not arouse much interest or support amongst the intelligentsia of the time.

The literature of the so-called "Bosnian revival" at the start of the 20th century was written in an idiom that was closer to the Croatian standard than to the Serbian one: it was a western Shtokavian dialect with an Ijekavian accent and used a Latin script, but had recognizable Bosnian lexical traits. The main authors were the polymath, politician and poet [[Safvet-beg Bašagić]] and the storyteller [[Edhem Mulabdić]].

The modern Bosnian standard took shape in the 1990s and 2000s. Lexically, Islamic-Oriental loanwords are more frequent; phonetically: the phoneme /x/ (letter ''h'') is reinstated in many words as a distinct feature of vernacular Bosniak speech and language tradition; also, there are some changes in grammar, morphology and orthography that reflect the Bosniak pre-[[World War I]] literary tradition, mainly that of the Bosniak renaissance at the beginning of the 20th century.

=== Controversy and recognition ===
[[File:Political correctness in Bosnia (14151146675).jpg|thumb|A [[Tobacco packaging warning messages|cigarette warning]] "Smoking seriously harms you and others around you", ostensibly in three languages. The "Bosnian" and "Croatian" versions are identical and the "Serbian" is a [[transliteration]] of the same.]]
The name "Bosnian language" is a controversial issue for some [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]], who also refer to it as the "Bosniak" language ({{lang-sh|bošnjački}} / {{lang|sh-Cyrl|бошњачки}}; {{IPA-sh|bǒʃɲaːtʃkiː|}}). Bosniak linguists however insist that the only legitimate name is "Bosnian" language (''{{lang|bs|bosanski}}''), and that that is the name that both Croats and Serbs should use. The controversy arises because the name "Bosnian" may seem to imply that it is the language of all Bosnians, while [[Bosnian Croats]] and [[Bosnian Serbs|Serbs]] reject that designation for their idioms.

The language is called ''Bosnian language'' in the 1995 [[Dayton Accords]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, a Grammar: With Sociolinguistic Commentary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6HTdZ5rxJ-cC&amp;pg=PA409 |last=Alexander |first=Ronelle |year=2006 |publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press |page=409 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is concluded by observers to have received legitimacy and international recognition at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Language and Identity in the Balkans: Serbo-Croatian and Its Disintegration |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_lNjHgr3QioC&amp;pg=PA136 |last=Greenberg |first=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2 |title=ISO 639-2 Registration Authority |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Board on Geographic Names]] (BGN), and the [[Permanent Committee on Geographical Names]] (PCGN) recognize the Bosnian language. Furthermore, the status of the Bosnian language is also recognized by bodies such as the [[United Nations]], [[UNESCO]], and translation and interpreting accreditation agencies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sussex |first=Roland |title=The Slavic Languages |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-22315-6 |pages=76 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including internet translation services.

Most English-speaking language encyclopaedias ([[Routledge]], [[Glottolog]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/bosn1245 |title=Bosnian |work=Glottolog }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethnologue]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/bos |title=Bosnian |work=Ethnologue }}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Comrie (ed.): The World's Major Languages. Second Edition. Routledge, New York/London, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; register the language solely as "Bosnian" language. The [[Library of Congress]] registered the language as "Bosnian" and gave it an ISO-number. The Slavic language institutes in English-speaking countries offer courses in "Bosnian" or "Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian" language, not in "Bosniak" language (e.g. Columbia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/BCRS/W1202-20161-001/ |title=Spring 2016 Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian W1202 section 001 |publisher=[[Columbia University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128123421/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/BCRS/W1202-20161-001/ |archivedate=2016-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=14&amp;coid=159062|title=BCS 1133 – Continuing Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian I – Acalog ACMS™ |publisher=[[Cornell University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://slavic.uchicago.edu/courses?f&amp;#91;0&amp;#93;=field_section%3A5 |title=Courses |work=[[University of Chicago]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Washington,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://slavic.washington.edu/fields/bosnian-croatian-serbian |title=Bosnian Croatian Serbian |publisher=[[University of Washington]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kansas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://slavic.ku.edu/why-study-bosniancroatianserbian-bcs-ku-slavic-department |title=Why Study Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian (BCS) with the KU Slavic Department? |publisher=[[University of Kansas]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The same thing in German-speaking countries, where the language is taught under the name ''{{lang|de|Bosnisch}}'', not ''{{lang|de|Bosniakisch}}'' (e.g. Vienna,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://slawistik.univie.ac.at/studium/curricula/ |title=Institut für Slawistik » Curricula |publisher=[[University of Vienna]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Graz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://translationswissenschaft.uni-graz.at/de/studieren/studienangebot-am-itat/ba-transkulturelle-kommunikation/bosnischkroatischserbisch/ |title=Bosnisch/Kroatisch/Serbisch |publisher=[[University of Graz]] |access-date=2015-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703104144/http://translationswissenschaft.uni-graz.at/de/studieren/studienangebot-am-itat/ba-transkulturelle-kommunikation/bosnischkroatischserbisch/# |archive-date=2016-07-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trier)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.uni-trier.de/index.php?id=55477 |title=Slavistik – Bosnisch-Kroatisch-Montenegrinisch-Serbisch |date=28 July 2015 |publisher=[[University of Trier]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; with very few exceptions.

Some Croatian linguists ([[Zvonko Kovač]], [[Ivo Pranjković]], [[Josip Silić]]) support the name "Bosnian" language, whereas others ([[Radoslav Katičić]], [[Dalibor Brozović]], [[Tomislav Ladan]]) hold that the term ''Bosnian language'' is the only one appropriate{{clarify|date=May 2014}} and that accordingly the terms Bosnian language and Bosniak language refer to two different things{{clarify|date=May 2014}}. The Croatian state institutions, such as the Central Bureau of Statistics, use both terms: "Bosniak" language was used in the 2001 census,&lt;ref name="DZS"&gt;[http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv/censuses/Census2001/Popis/H01_02_03/H01_02_03.html Central Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Croatia] Census of 2001, Population by native language&lt;/ref&gt; while the census in 2011 used the term "Bosnian" language.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv/censuses/census2011/results/htm/H01_01_09/H01_01_09.html |accessdate=January 19, 2014 |title=Central Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Croatia, Census of 2011, Population by native language }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Serbian linguists hold that the term ''Bosniak language'' is the only one appropriate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rastko.rs/filologija/odbor/odluka001_c.html |title=[Projekat Rastko] Odbor za standardizaciju srpskog jezika|work=rastko.rs}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was agreed as early as 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Svein Mønnesland, »Language Policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina«, (pp 135–155.).

"Already in 1990 the Committee for the Serbian language decided that only the term 'Bosniac language' should be used officially in Serbia, and this was confirmed in 1998."&lt;/ref&gt;

The original form of [[The Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] called the language "Bosniac language",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina |url=http://www.ohr.int/print/?content_id=5907 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020301141803/http://www.ohr.int/print/?content_id=5907 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1 March 2002 |publisher=[[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] |accessdate=3 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until 2002 when it was changed in Amendment XXIX of the Constitution of the Federation by [[Wolfgang Petritsch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ohr.int/decisions/statemattersdec/default.asp?content_id=7475 |title=Decision on Constitutional Amendments in the Federation |publisher=[[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020513193906/http://www.ohr.int/decisions/statemattersdec/default.asp?content_id=7475 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 13, 2002 |accessdate=January 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original text of the Constitution of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was agreed in [[Vienna]], and was signed by [[Krešimir Zubak]] and [[Haris Silajdžić]] on March 18, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/peace_agreements/washagree_03011994.pdf |title=Washington Agreement |accessdate=January 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution of {{lang|sr|[[Republika Srpska]]}}, the Serb-dominated entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina, did not recognize any language or ethnic group other than Serbian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Constitution of the Republika Srpska |url=http://www.usefoundation.org/foundation/research/olp/viewLegislation.asp?CID=15&amp;LID=32 |publisher=U.S. English Foundation Research |accessdate=3 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721164105/http://www.usefoundation.org/foundation/research/olp/viewLegislation.asp?CID=15&amp;LID=32 |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosniaks were mostly expelled from the territory controlled by the Serbs from 1992, but immediately after the war they demanded the restoration of their civil rights in those territories. The Bosnian Serbs refused to make reference to the Bosnian language in their constitution and as a result had constitutional amendments imposed by [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|High Representative]] [[Wolfgang Petritsch]].

{{See also|Serbo-Croatian phonology|Serbo-Croatian grammar}}
The differences between the Bosnian, Serbian, and Croatian literary standards are minimal. Although Bosnian employs more Turkish, Persian, and Arabic loanwords—commonly called orientalisms—it is very similar to both Serbian and Croatian in its written and spoken form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Or Montenegrin?

The Bosnian language, as a new normative register of the Shtokavian dialect, was officially introduced in 1996 with the publication of ''{{lang|bs|Pravopis bosanskog jezika}}'' in Sarajevo.{{sfn|Sotirović|2014|p=48}} According to that work, Bosnian differed from Serbian and Croatian on some main linguistic characteristics, such as: sound formats in some words, especially "h" (''{{lang|bs|kahva}}'' versus Serbian ''{{lang|sr|kafa}}''); substantial and deliberate usage of Oriental ("Turkish") words; spelling of future tense (''{{lang|bs|kupit ću}}'') as in Croatian but not Serbian (''{{lang|sr|kupiću}}'') (both forms have the same pronunciation).{{sfn|Sotirović|2014|p=48}}

The '''bouba/kiki effect''' is a non-arbitrary mapping between speech sounds and the visual shape of objects. This effect was first observed by German-American psychologist [[Wolfgang Köhler]] in 1929.&lt;ref name = Kohler1929&gt;{{cite book | author = Köhler, W | year = 1929 | title = Gestalt Psychology. | location = New York | publisher = Liveright}}&lt;/ref&gt; In psychological experiments first conducted on the island of [[Tenerife]] (where the primary language is [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), Köhler showed forms similar to those shown at the right and asked participants which shape was called "takete" and which was called "baluba" ("maluma" in the 1947 version). Although not explicitly stated, Köhler implies that there was a strong preference to pair the jagged shape with "takete" and the rounded shape with "baluba".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Köhler, W | year = 1947 | title = Gestalt Psychology | edition = 2nd | location = New York | publisher = Liveright | page = 224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]] and Edward Hubbard repeated Köhler's experiment using the words "kiki" and "bouba" and asked American college undergraduates and Tamil speakers in India "Which of these shapes is bouba and which is kiki?" In both groups, 95% to 98% selected the curvy shape as "bouba" and the jagged one as "kiki", suggesting that the human brain somehow attaches abstract meanings to the shapes and sounds in a consistent way.&lt;ref name = "Rama2001"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ramachandran, VS | author2 = Hubbard, EM | last-author-amp = yes | year = 2001b | title = Synaesthesia: A window into perception, thought and language | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 8 | issue = 12 | pages = 3–34 | url = http://cbc.ucsd.edu/pdf/Synaesthesia%20-%20JCS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Work by [[Daphne Maurer]] and colleagues shows that even children as young as 2{{frac|1|2}} years old may show this effect as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maurer D, Pathman T, Mondloch CJ | last-author-amp = yes | year = 2006 | title = The shape of boubas: Sound-shape correspondences in toddlers and adults | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 316–322 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2006.00495.x | pmid = 16669803 | url = http://psych.mcmaster.ca/maurerlab/Publications/Maurer_bouba.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723035944/http://psych.mcmaster.ca/maurerlab/Publications/Maurer_bouba.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect does not occur in all communities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogers|first=S.K.|last2=Ross|first2=A.S.|date=1975|title=A cross-cultural test of the maluma-takete phenomenon|url=|journal=Perception|volume=4|pages=105–106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it appears that the effect breaks if the sounds do not make licit words in the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Syles|first=Suzy|last2=Gawne|first2=Lauren|date=2017|title=When Does Maluma/Takete Fail?

The effect has also been shown to emerge when the words to be paired are existing first names, suggesting that some familiarity with the linguistic stimuli does not eliminate the effect. A study showed that individuals will pair names such as "Molly" with round silhouettes, and names such as "Kate" with sharp silhouettes. Moreover, individuals will associate different personality traits with either group of names (''e.g.'', easygoingness with "round names"; determination with "sharp names"). This may hint at a role of abstract concepts in the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sidhu|first=David M.|last2=Pexman|first2=Penny M.|date=2015-05-27|title=What’s in a Name?

Ramachandran and Hubbard suggest that the kiki/bouba effect has implications for the evolution of language, because it suggests that the naming of objects is not completely arbitrary.&lt;ref name = "Rama2001" /&gt;{{rp|17}} The rounded shape may most commonly be named "bouba" because the mouth makes a more rounded shape to produce that sound while a more taut, angular mouth shape is needed to make the sound "kiki".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=D’Onofrio|first1=Annette|title=Phonetic Detail and Dimensionality in Sound-shape Correspondences: Refining the ''Bouba-Kiki'' Paradigm|journal=Language and Speech|date=15 November 2013|volume=57|issue=3|pages=367–393|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1020.1352&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the distinction may be between [[Coronal consonant|coronal]] or [[Dorsal consonant|dorsal]] consonants like [[Voiceless velar stop|/k/]] and [[Labial consonant|labial]] consonants like [[Voiced bilabial stop|/b/]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Additionally, it was shown that it is not only different consonants (e.g., voiceless versus voiced) and different vowel qualities (e.g., /a/ versus /i/) that play a role in the effect, but also vowel quantity (long versus short vowels). In one study, participants rated words containing long vowels to refer to longer objects and short vowels to short objects.&lt;ref&gt;Bross, F. (2018). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323749384_Cognitive_associations_between_vowel_length_and_object_size_A_new_feature_contributing_to_a_boubakiki_effect Cognitive associations between vowel length and object size: A new feature contributing to a bouba/kiki effect].

Berlin: Humbold University, 17-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of these "[[synesthesia]]-like mappings" suggest that this effect might be the neurological basis for [[sound symbolism]], in which sounds are non-arbitrarily mapped to objects and events in the world.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

More recently, research indicated that the effect may be a case of [[ideasthesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Gómez Milán, E., Iborra, O., de Córdoba, M.J., Juárez-Ramos V., Rodríguez Artacho, M.A., Rubio, J.L. (2013) The Kiki-Bouba effect: A case of personification and ideaesthesia. ''The Journal of Consciousness Studies.''  20(1-2): pp. 84-102.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideasthesia (alternative spelling ideaesthesia) is defined as a phenomenon in which activations of concepts (inducers) evoke perception-like experiences (concurrents). The name comes from the Greek ''idea'' and ''aisthesis'', meaning "sensing concepts" or "sensing ideas", and was introduced by Danko Nikolić.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nikolić|first1=Danko|title=Is synaesthesia actually ideaestesia? An inquiry into the nature of the phenomenon|journal=Proceedings of the Third International Congress on Synaesthesia, Science &amp; Art|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Autism|Autistic]] individuals do not show as strong a preference. Individuals without autism agree with the standard result 88% of the time, while individuals with autism agree only 56% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oberman LM, Ramachandran VS | last-author-amp = yes | year = 2008 | title = Preliminary evidence for deficits in multisensory integration in autism spectrum disorders: the mirror neuron hypothesis | journal = Social Neuroscience |volume = 3 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 348–55 | pmid = 18979385 | doi = 10.1080/17470910701563681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chungli Ao''' is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language of northeast India. It is the most widely-spoken language and the prestige language of the [[Ao languages]], spoken by the [[Ao Naga|Ao Nagas]] of [[Nagaland]].

==History==
During the American Baptist Mission to Naga Hills, Dr E.W.Clark first came in contact with the Molungkimong village that paved the way for a common Ao language. Chungli Ao is spoken in Molungkimong and Molungyimsen and other villages throughout Ao territory by roughly 50% of the Ao-speaking population. The speech of Molungkimong is the [[prestige dialect]] due to [[Baptist]] [[missionaries]]' influence. Most Ao can speak Chungli even if they are from Mongsen-speaking regions. Chungli is taught in schools. Various trans-Dikhu neighbouring dialects of Chungli Ao are spoken east of the [[Dikhu River]] in Yacham, Tengsa, and Longla. These are poorly documented; Yacham and Tengsa may be separate languages (van Driem 2001).

'''Commercial character design''' is the process of creating a character and utilising it to enhance or publicise a commercial entity through design. 

== Design process ==
Examples of characters which have been designed to be used in a commercial application are found throughout the modern world, on advertisement billboards, murals, graphic marketing within interior spaces and within recent years, as animations on the Internet. A character can appear in two dimension (2D) or as a three-dimensional design (3D) as modelled using a computer or traditionally sculpted. Commercial entities use characters which are designed to embody a [[brand image]] or enhance a sales campaign.

== Well-known designers ==
Well known design companies include:
*[[Walt Disney Company]] (animators and cartoonists)
*[[Leo Burnett Worldwide]] (advertisers)

In [[formal language theory]], a '''context-sensitive language''' is a language that can be defined by a [[context-sensitive grammar]] (and equivalently by a [[noncontracting grammar]]).  Context-sensitive is one of the four types of grammars in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]].

== Computational properties ==

Computationally, a context-sensitive language is equivalent with a linear bounded [[nondeterministic Turing machine]], also called a [[linear bounded automaton]]. That is a non-deterministic Turing machine with a tape of only &lt;math&gt;kn&lt;/math&gt; cells, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the input and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant associated with the machine. This means that every formal language that can be decided by such a machine is a context-sensitive language, and every context-sensitive language can be decided by such a machine.

This set of languages is also known as '''NLINSPACE''' or '''NSPACE'''(''O''(''n'')), because they can be accepted using linear space on a non-deterministic Turing machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Clearly '''LINSPACE''' is a subset of '''NLINSPACE''', but it is not known whether '''LINSPACE'''='''NLINSPACE'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Examples ==&lt;!-- [[Bach language]] redirects here --&gt;

One of the simplest context-sensitive but not context-free languages is &lt;math&gt;L = \{ a^nb^nc^n : n \ge 1 \}&lt;/math&gt;: the language of all strings consisting of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; occurrences of the symbol "a", then &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; "b"'s, then &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; "c"'s (abc, {{not a typo|aabbcc}}, {{not a typo|aaabbbccc}}, etc.). A superset of this language, called the Bach language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Pullum |first=Geoffrey K. |year=1983 |title=Context-freeness and the computer processing of human languages |conference=Proc. 21st Annual Meeting of the [[Association for Computational Linguistics|ACL]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as the set of all strings where "a", "b" and "c" (or any other set of three symbols) occurs equally often ({{not a typo|aabccb}}, {{not a typo|baabcaccb}}, etc.) and is also context-sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;Bach, E. (1981). [http://people.umass.edu/ebach/papers/nels11.htm "Discontinuous constituents in generalized categorial grammars"]. ''NELS'', vol. 11, pp.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joshi, A.; Vijay-Shanker, K.; and Weir, D. (1991). "The convergence of mildly context-sensitive grammar formalisms". In: Sells, P., Shieber, S.M. and Wasow, T. (Editors). ''Foundational Issues in Natural Language Processing''. Cambridge MA: Bradford.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; can be shown to be a context-sensitive language by constructing a linear bounded automaton which accepts &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. The language can easily be shown to be neither [[regular language|regular]] nor [[context-free language|context free]] by applying the respective [[pumping lemma]]s for each of the language classes to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly:
 
&lt;math&gt;L_{Cross} = \{ a^mb^nc^{m}d^{n} : m \ge 1, n \ge 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; is another context-sensitive language; the corresponding &lt;math&gt;CSG&lt;/math&gt; can be easily projected starting with two context-free grammars generating sentential forms in the formats
&lt;math&gt;a^mC^m&lt;/math&gt;
and
&lt;math&gt;B^nd^n&lt;/math&gt;
and then supplementing them with a permutation production like 
&lt;math&gt;CB\rightarrow BC&lt;/math&gt;, a new starting symbol and standard syntactic sugar.


&lt;math&gt;L_{MUL3} = \{ a^mb^nc^{mn} : m \ge 1, n \ge 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; is another context-sensitive language (the "3" in the name of this language is intended to mean a ternary alphabet); that is, the "product" operation defines a context-sensitive language (but the "sum" defines only a context-free language as the grammar &lt;math&gt;S\rightarrow aSc|R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R\rightarrow bRc|bc&lt;/math&gt; shows). Because of the commutative property of the product, the most intuitive grammar for &lt;math&gt;L_{mn}&lt;/math&gt; is ambiguous. This problem can be avoided considering a somehow more restrictive definition of the language, e.g. &lt;math&gt;L_{ORDMUL3} = \{ a^mb^nc^{mn} : 1 &lt; m &lt; n \}&lt;/math&gt;. This can be specialized to 
&lt;math&gt;L_{MUL1} = \{ a^{mn} : m &gt; 1,  n &gt; 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; and, from this, to &lt;math&gt;L_{m^2} = \{ a^{m^2} : m &gt; 1 \}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L_{m^3} = \{ a^{m^3} : m &gt; 1 \}&lt;/math&gt;, etc.


&lt;math&gt;L_{REP} = \{ w^{|w|} : w \in \Sigma^* \}&lt;/math&gt; is a context-sensitive language. The corresponding &lt;math&gt;CSG&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained as a generalization of the &lt;math&gt;CSGs&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;L_{Square} = \{ w^2 : w \in \Sigma^* \}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L_{Cube} = \{ w^3 : w \in \Sigma^* \}&lt;/math&gt;, etc.


&lt;math&gt;L_{EXP} = \{ a^{2^n} : n \ge 1  \}&lt;/math&gt; is a context-sensitive language (see  example 9.5 (p. 224) of Hopcroft, John E.; Ullman, Jeffrey D. (1979). Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation. Addison-Wesley).


&lt;math&gt;L_{PRIMES2} = \{ w : |w| \mbox { is prime }  \}&lt;/math&gt; is a context-sensitive language (the "2" in the name of this language is intended to mean a binary alphabet). This was proved by Hartmanis using pumping lemmas for regular and context-free languages over a binary alphabet and, after that, sketching a multitape LBA accepting &lt;math&gt;L_{PRIMES2}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1145/321466.321470 | url= | author=J. Hartmanis and H. Shank | title=On the Recognition of Primes by Automata | journal=[[Journal of the ACM]] | volume=15 | number=3 | pages=382-389 | date=Jul 1968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;


&lt;math&gt;L_{PRIMES1} = \{ a^p : p \mbox { is prime }  \}&lt;/math&gt; is a context-sensitive language (the "1" in the name of this language is intended to mean an unary alphabet). This was credited by A. Salomaa to Matti Soittola by means of a &lt;math&gt;LBA&lt;/math&gt; over an unary alphabet&lt;ref&gt;Salomaa, Arto (1969), ''Theory of Automata'', {{ISBN|978-0-08-013376-8}}, Pergamon, 276 pages. {{doi|10.1016/C2013-0-02221-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;(pages 213-214, exercise 6.8) and also to Marti Penttonen by means of a &lt;math&gt;CSG&lt;/math&gt; also over an unary alphabet (See: Formal Languages by A. Salomaa, page 14, Example 2.5).


An example of [[recursive language]] that is not context-sensitive is any recursive language whose decision is an [[EXPSPACE]]-hard problem, say, the set of pairs of equivalent [[regular expression]]s with exponentiation.

== Properties of context-sensitive languages ==

* The union, intersection, concatenation of two context-sensitive languages is context-sensitive, also the [[Kleene star#Kleene plus|Kleene plus]] of a context-sensitive language is context-sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John E. Hopcroft|author2=Jeffrey D. Ullman|title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1979}}; Exercise 9.10, p.230. In the 2000 edition, the chapter on context-sensitive languages has been omitted.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The complement of a context-sensitive language is itself context-sensitive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Immerman | first = Neil | year = 1988 | title =Nondeterministic space is closed under complementation | journal = SIAM J. Comput. | issue = 5 | pages = 935–938 | doi = 10.1137/0217058 | volume = 17 | url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/pub/space.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; a result known as the [[Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem]].
* Membership of a string in a language defined by an arbitrary context-sensitive grammar, or by an arbitrary deterministic context-sensitive grammar, is a [[PSPACE-complete]] problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4219">'''Croatian National Corpus''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatski nacionalni korpus}}, ''HNK'') is the biggest and the most important corpus of the [[Croatian language]]. Its compilation started in 1998 at the Institute of Linguistics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffzg.hr/zzl Institute of Linguistics]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb|Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences]], [[University of Zagreb]] following the ideas of  [http://hnk.ffzg.hr/mt Marko Tadić]. The theoretical foundations and the expression of the need for a general-purpose, representative and multi-million corpus of the Croatian language started to appear even earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Tadić 1990, [http://www.hnk.ffzg.hr/txts/mt4hnk.pdf 1996], [http://www.hnk.ffzg.hr/txts/mt4hnk2.pdf 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; The Croatian National Corpus is compiled from selected texts written in Croatian covering all fields, topics, genres and styles: from literary and scientific texts to text-books, newspaper, user-groups and chat rooms.

The initial composition was divided in two constituents:
# ''30-million corpus of contemporary Croatian language'' (30m) where samples from texts from 1990 on were included. The criteria for inclusion of text samples were: written by native speakers, different fields, genres and topics. Translated text or poetry were excluded.
# ''Croatian Electronic Text Archive'' (HETA) where the complete text were included, particularly serial publications (volumes, series, editions etc.) which would imbalance the 30m if they were inserted there.

Since 2004, with the adoption of the concept of the 3rd generation corpus, the two-constituent structure has been abandoned in favor of several subcorpora and larger size. Since 2005 HNK 105 million tokens and is composed of number of different subcorpora which can be searched individually and all together in a whole corpus. Since 2004 HNK also migrated to a new server platform, namely Manatee/Bonito server-client architecture. For searching the HNK (today still with free test access) a free client program Bonito&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textforge.cz Bonito]&lt;/ref&gt; is needed.

'''Cypriot Greek''' ({{lang-el|Κυπριακά}}) is the [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]] of [[Modern Greek]] that is spoken by the majority of the [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] populace and [[Greek Cypriot diaspora]]. It is a markedly divergent variety as it differs from [[Standard Modern Greek]]{{efn|group=note|Standard Modern Greek is the variety based on [[Demotic Greek|Demotic]] (but with elements of [[Katharevousa]]) that became the official language of [[Greece]] in 1976. See also: [[Greek language question]].}} in various aspects of its [[lexicon]],{{sfn|Ammon|2006|p=1886}} [[phonetics]], [[phonology]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]] and even [[pragmatics]],{{sfn|Themistocleous|Katsoyannou|Armosti|Christodoulou|2012|p=262}} not only for historical reasons, but also because of geographical isolation, different settlement patterns, and extensive contact with [[Linguistic typology|typologically distinct]] languages.{{sfn|Ammon|2006|pp=1886–1887}}

==Classification==
 [[File:Griechisch Isoglossen 1900.png|thumb|300px|Some phonological phenomena Cypriot shares with varieties of the Aegean: word-initial gemination; word-final {{IPA|/n/}}; and palatalisation of {{IPA|/k/}} to {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}}.]]
Cypriot Greek is not an evolution of ancient [[Arcadocypriot Greek]], but derives from Byzantine [[Medieval Greek]].{{sfn|Joseph|Tserdanelis|2003|p=823}} It has traditionally been placed in the [[Varieties of Modern Greek#Core dialects|southeastern group of Modern Greek varieties]], along with the dialects of the [[Dodecanese]] and [[Chios]] (with which it shares several phonological phenomena).

Though Cypriot Greek tends to be regarded as a [[Dialect#"Dialect" or "language"|dialect]] by its speakers, it is unintelligible to speakers of Standard Modern Greek without adequate prior exposure.{{sfn|Arvaniti|2006|p=26}} Greek-speaking Cypriots are [[diglossia|diglossic]] in the [[vernacular]] Cypriot Greek (the "low" variety) and Standard Modern Greek (the "high" variety).{{sfn|Arvaniti|2006|p=25}}{{sfn|Tsiplakou|2012}} Cypriot Greek is itself a [[dialect continuum]] with an emerging [[wikt:koine|koine]].{{sfn|Arvaniti|2006|pp=26–27}} {{harvtxt|Davy|Ioannou|Panayotou|1996}} argue that diglossia has given way to a "post-diglossic [dialectal] continuum [...] a quasi-continuous spread of overlapping varieties".{{sfn|Davy|Ioannou|Panayotou|1996|pp=131,135}}

==Phonology==
Studies of the phonology of Cypriot Greek are few and tend to examine very specific phenomena, e.g. [[gemination]], "glide hardening". A general overview of the phonology of Cypriot Greek has only ever been attempted once, by {{harvnb|Newton|1972}}, but parts of it are now contested.

===Consonants===
Cypriot Greek has geminate and [[palato-alveolar consonant]]s, which Standard Modern Greek lacks, as well as a contrast between {{IPA|[ɾ]}} and {{IPA|[r]}}, which Standard Modern Greek also lacks.{{sfn|Arvaniti|2010|pp=3–4}} The table below, adapted from {{harvnb|Arvaniti|2010|p=4}}, depicts the consonantal inventory of Cypriot Greek.

Stops {{IPA|/p t c k/}} and affricate {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} are [[Aspiration (phonetics)|unaspirated]] and may be pronounced weakly [[Voicing (phonetics)|voiced]] in fast speech.{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|pp=2–3}} {{IPA|/pʰː tʰː cʰː kʰː/}} are always heavily [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] and they are never preceded by nasals,{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|p=2}} with the exception of some [[loanword|loans]], e.g. {{IPA|/ʃamˈpʰːu/}} "shampoo".{{sfn|Davy|Ioannou|Panayotou|1996|p=134}} {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/t͡ʃʰː/}} are [[laminal]] post-alveolars.{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|p=3}} {{IPA|/t͡s/}} is pronounced similarly to {{IPA|/t͡ʃʰː/}}, in terms of closure duration and aspiration.{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|p=3}}

Voiced fricatives {{IPA|/v ð ɣ/}} are often pronounced as [[Approximant consonant|approximants]] and they are regularly [[Elision|elided]] when [[Intervocalic consonant|intervocalic]].{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|pp=2–3}} {{IPA|/ʝ/}} is similarly often realised as an approximant {{IPA link|j|[}} in weak positions.{{sfn|Arvaniti|2010|p=11}}

The palatal lateral approximant {{IPA|/ʎ/}} is most often realised as a singleton or geminate lateral {{IPA|[ʎ(ː)]}} or a singleton or geminate fricative {{IPA|[ʝ(ː)]}}, and sometimes as a glide {{IPA|[j]}} (cf. [[yeísmo]]).{{sfn|Pappas|2009|p=307}} The circumstances under which all the different variants surface are not very well understood, but {{IPA|[ʝ(ː)]}} appear to be favoured in stressed syllables and word-finally, and before {{IPA|/a e/}}.{{sfn|Pappas|2009|p=309}} {{harvnb|Pappas|2009}} identifies the following phonological and non-phonological influencing factors: stress, preceding vowel, following vowel, position inside word; and sex, education, region, and time spent living in Greece (where {{IPA|[ʎ]}} is standard).{{sfn|Pappas|2009|p=309}} {{harvnb|Arvaniti|2010}} notes that speakers of some local varieties, notably that of [[Larnaca]], "substitute" the geminate fricative for {{IPA|/ʎ/}},{{sfn|Arvaniti|2010|pp=10–11}} but {{harvnb|Pappas|2009}} contests this, saying that, "{{IPA|[ʝ(ː)]}} is robustly present in the three urban areas of Lefkosia, Lemesos and Larnaka as well as the rural Kokinohoria region, especially among teenaged speakers ... the innovative pronunciation {{IPA|[ʝ(ː)]}} is not a feature of any local [[patois]], but rather a supra-local feature."{{sfn|Pappas|2009|p=313}}

The palatal nasal {{IPA|/ɲ/}} is produced somewhat longer than other singleton nasals, though not as long as geminates. {{IPA|/z/}} is similarly "rather long".{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|pp=2–3}}

The alveolar trill {{IPA|/r/}} is the geminate counterpart of the tap {{IPA|/ɾ/}}.{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|p=3}}&lt;!-- {{IPA|/ɾ/}} is devoiced before voiceless consonants.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}--&gt;

====Palatalisation and glide hardening====
In analyses that posit a phonemic (but not phonetic) [[glide (linguistics)|glide]] {{IPA|/j/}}, palatals and postalveolars arise from &lt;tt&gt;CJV&lt;/tt&gt; (consonant–glide–vowel) clusters, namely:{{sfn|Nevins|Chirotan|2008|pp=13–14}}

{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|
* {{IPA|/mj}}&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;{{IPA|/}} → {{IPA|[mɲ}}&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;{{IPA|]}}
* {{IPA|/nj}}&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;{{IPA|/}} → {{IPA|[ɲː}}&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;{{IPA|]}}
* {{IPA|/lj}}&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;{{IPA|/}} → {{IPA|[ʎː}}&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;{{IPA|]}} or {{IPA|[ʝː}}&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;{{IPA|]}}
* {{IPA|/kj}}&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;{{IPA|/}} → {{IPA|[t͡ʃ}}&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;{{IPA|]}} or {{IPA|[c}}&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;{{IPA|]}}
* {{IPA|/xj}}&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;{{IPA|/}} → {{IPA|[ʃ}}&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;{{IPA|]}} or {{IPA|[ç}}&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;{{IPA|]}}
* {{IPA|/ɣj}}&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;{{IPA|/}} → {{IPA|[ʝ}}&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;{{IPA|]}}
* {{IPA|/zj}}&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;{{IPA|/}} → {{IPA|[ʒː}}&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;{{IPA|]}}
* {{IPA|/t͡sj}}&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;{{IPA|/}} → {{IPA|[t͡ʃʰː}}&lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;{{IPA|]}}
}}

The glide is not assimilated, but hardens to an [[obstruent]] {{IPA|[c]}} after {{IPA|/p t f v θ ð/}} and to {{IPA|[k]}} after {{IPA|/ɾ/}}.{{sfn|Nevins|Chirotan|2008|pp=13–14}} At any rate, velar stops and fricatives are in [[complementary distribution]] with palatals and postalveolars before front vowels {{IPA|/e i/}};{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|p=3}} that is to say, broadly, {{IPA|/k kʰː/}} are [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalised]] to either {{IPA|[c cʰː]}} or {{IPA|[t͡ʃ t͡ʃʰː]}}; {{IPA|/x xː/}} to {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ç}} çː]}} or {{IPA|[ʃ ʃː]}}; and {{IPA|/ɣ/}} to {{IPA|[ʝ]}}.

====Geminates====
There is considerable disagreement on how to classify Cypriot Greek geminates, though they are now generally understood to be "geminates proper" (rather than clusters of identical phonemes or "[[Fortis and lenis|fortis]]" consonants).{{sfn|Arvaniti|2010|p=12}} Geminates are 1.5 to 2 times longer than singletons, depending, primarily, on position and stress.{{sfn|Arvaniti|2010|pp=4–5}} Geminates occur both word-initially and word-medially. Word-initial geminates tend to be somewhat longer.{{sfn|Arvaniti|2010|p=5}} {{harvnb|Tserdanelis|Arvaniti|2001}} have found that "for stops, in particular, this lengthening affects both closure duration and [[Voice onset time|VOT]]",{{sfn|Tserdanelis|Arvaniti|2001|p=35}} but {{harvnb|Davy|Panayotou|2003}} claim that stops contrast only in aspiration, and not duration.{{sfn|Davy|Panayotou|2003|p=8|ps=: "... there is no evidence for the assumption that CG {{IPA|/pʰ/}} is distinctively long (or geminate). The CGasp system contains simply tense aspirated and lax unaspirated stops."}} {{harvnb|Armosti|2010}} undertook a perceptual study with thirty native speakers of Cypriot Greek,{{sfn|Armosti|2010|pp=37}} and has found that both closure duration and (the duration and properties of) aspiration provide important cues in distinguishing between the two kinds of stops, but aspiration is slightly more significant.{{sfn|Armosti|2010|pp=52–53}}

====Assimilatory processes====
Word-final {{IPA|/n/}} [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilates]] with succeeding consonants—other than stops and affricates—at word boundaries producing post-lexical geminates.{{sfn|Arvaniti|2010|p=8}} Consequently, geminate voiced fricatives, though generally not phonemic, do occur as allophones. &lt;!--For {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/lː/}}, this process was found to give rise to a four-way durational distinction: lexical singleton {{IPA|/l/}}, lexical geminate {{IPA|/lː/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} + singleton {{IPA|/l/}} → post-lexical {{IPA|[lˑ]}} (shorter than the lexical geminate), and {{IPA|/n/}} + geminate {{IPA|/lː/}} → post-lexical "super-geminate" {{IPA|[lːˑ]}} (longer).{{sfn|Payne|Eftychiou|2006|p=195}} This might hold true for consonants other than {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/lː/}}, but no studies have been conducted to prove that that is the case. {{harvnb|Armosti|2007}} casts doubt on whether this difference is phonemic.{{sfn|Armosti|2007|pp=763–764|ps=: "The only robust contrast was arguably between S and WI-G, i.e. between lexical categories. The post-lexical categories, and especially WB-G, were not readily identified by the subjects. No concrete evidence was found for the four categories being, in fact, four linguistically functional categories."}}--&gt; Below are some examples of geminates to arise from [[sandhi]].
* {{IPA|/ton ˈluka/}} → {{IPA|[to‿ˈlˑuka]}} {{lang|el|τον Λούκα}} "Lucas" (acc.)
* {{IPA|/en ˈða/}} → {{IPA|[e‿ˈðːa]}} {{lang|el|εν δα}} "[he] is here"
* {{IPA|/pu tin ˈɾiza/}} → {{IPA|[pu ti‿ˈriza]}} {{lang|el|που την ρίζα}} "from the root"

In contrast, singleton stops and affricates do not undergo gemination, but become fully voiced when preceded by a nasal, with the nasal becoming [[Homorganic consonants|homorganic]].{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|pp=2–3}} This process is not restricted to terminal nasals; singleton stops and affricates always become voiced following a nasal.{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|p=4}}
* {{IPA|/kaˈpnizumen ˈpuɾa/}} → {{IPA|[kaˈpnizumem‿ˈbuɾa]}} {{lang|el|καπνίζουμεν πούρα}} "[we] smoke cigars"
* {{IPA|/an ˈt͡ʃe/}} → {{IPA|[an‿ˈd͡ʒe]}} {{lang|el|αν τζ̌αι}} "even though"
* {{IPA|/tin ciɾi.aˈci/}} → {{IPA|[tiɲ‿ɟirĭ.aˈci]}} {{lang|el|την Κυριακή}} "on Sunday"

Word-final {{IPA|/n/}} is altogether [[Elision|elided]] before geminate stops and consonant clusters:{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|p=5}}
* {{IPA|/eˈpiasamen ˈfcoɾa/}} → {{IPA|[eˈpcasame‿ˈfcoɾa]}} {{lang|el|επιάσαμεν φκιόρα}} "[we] bought flowers"
* {{IPA|/ˈpa‿stin cʰːeˈlːe/}} → {{IPA|[ˈpa‿sti‿cʰːeˈlːe]}} {{lang|el|πα' στην κκελλέ}} "on the head"

Like with {{IPA|/n/}}, word-final {{IPA|/s/}} assimilates to following {{IPA|[s]}} and {{IPA|[ʃ]}} producing geminates:{{sfn|Armosti|2011|p=97}}
* {{IPA|/as ʃoˈnisi/}} → {{IPA|[a‿ʃːoˈnisi]}} {{lang|el|ας σ̌ονίσει}} "let it snow"

Lastly, word-final {{IPA|/s/}} becomes voiced when followed by a voiced consonant belonging to the same phrase:{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|p=5}}
* {{IPA|/tis ˈmaltas/}} → {{IPA|[tiz‿ˈmaltas]}} {{lang|el|της Μάλτας}} "of [[Malta]]"
* {{IPA|/aˈɣonas ˈðromu/}} → {{IPA|[aˈɣonaz‿ˈðromu]}} {{lang|el|αγώνας δρόμου}} "race"

===Vowels===
[[File:Cypriot Greek vowel chart.svg|thumb|250px|The [[Vowel diagram|vowels]] of Cypriot Greek. Adapted from {{harvnb|Arvaniti|1999|p=4}}.]]

Cypriot Greek has a five-vowel system {{IPA|/{{IPA link|i}}, {{IPA link|u}}, {{IPA link|e̞|e}}, {{IPA link|o̞|o}}, {{IPA link|ɐ|a}}/}}{{sfn|Georgiou|2018|p=70}} that is nearly identical to that of Standard Modern Greek (see for an acoustic comparison of the two vowel systems {{harvnb|Themistocleous|2017}} and {{harvnb|Themistocleous|2017}}).

Back vowels {{IPA|/i u/}} following {{IPA|/t/}} at the end of an utterance are regularly reduced (50% of all cases presented in study) to "fricated vowels" (40% of all cases, cf. Slavic [[yer]]s), and are sometimes [[Elision|elided]] altogether (5% of all cases).{{sfn|Eftychiou|2007|p=518}}

In glide-less analyses, {{IPA|/i/}} may alternate with {{IPA|[k]}} or {{IPA|[c]}},{{sfn|Arvaniti|2010|p=1}} e.g. {{IPA|[kluvi]}} "cage" → {{IPA|[klufca]}} "cages", or {{IPA|[kulːuɾi]}} "[[wikt:koulouri|koulouri]]" → {{IPA|[kulːuɾ̥ka]}} "koulouria"; and, like in Standard Modern Greek, it is pronounced {{IPA|[ɲ]}} when found between {{IPA|/m/}} and another vowel that belongs to the same syllable,{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|p=4}} e.g. {{IPA|[mɲa]}} "one" (f.).

===Stress===
Cypriot Greek has [[Stress (linguistics)|"dynamic" stress]].{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|p=5}} Both consonants and vowels are longer in stressed than in unstressed syllables, and the effect is stronger word-initially.{{sfn|Arvaniti|2010|pp=17–18}} There is only one stress per word, and it can fall on any of the last four syllables. Stress on the fourth syllable from the end of a word is rare and normally limited to certain verb forms. Because of this possibility, however, when words with antepenultimate stress are followed by an enclitic in Cypriot Greek, no extra stress is added (unlike Standard Modern Greek, where the stress can only fall on one of the last three syllables),{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|p=5}} e.g. Cypriot Greek {{lang|el|το ποδήλατον μου}} {{IPA|[to poˈðilato‿mːu]}}, Standard Modern Greek {{lang|el|το ποδήλατό μου}} {{IPA|[to poˌðilaˈto‿mu]}} "my bicycle".

==Grammar==
{{Further|Modern Greek grammar}}

An overview of syntactic and morphological differences between Standard Modern Greek and Cypriot Greek can be found in {{harvnb|Hadjioannou|Tsiplakou|Kappler|2011|pp=568-9}}.
&lt;!--

===Morphology===
The main morphological differences between Standard Modern Greek and Cypriot Greek are the following:{{sfn|Hadjioannou|Tsiplakou|Kappler|2011|p=568}}
* different [[interrogative word]] for "what" {{lang|el|ίντα}} {{IPA|[ˈi&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;da]}} instead of {{lang|el|τί}} {{IPA|[ti]}}
* different [[determiner]] {{lang|el|τες}} {{IPA|[tes]}} instead of {{lang|el|τις}} {{IPA|[tis]}} in the [[grammatical gender|feminine]] [[accusative case|accusative]] plural
* penultimate stress in the [[nominative case|nominative]] plural of second [[declension]] nouns and the [[genitive case|genitive]] plural of first declension feminine [[pronoun]]s{{clarify|reason=Please provide the NOM sg. place of accent of (various) cases so that a comparison can be made with SMG.|date=April 2015}}
* different plural [[morpheme]]s, e.g. {{lang|el|γιούδες}} {{IPA|[ˈʝuðes]}} instead of {{lang|el|γιοι}} {{IPA|[ʝi]}} "sons" (sg. {{lang|el|γιος}}){{clarify|reason=In which declension(s)/group(s)?|date=April 2015}}
* different [[demonstrative pronoun]] {{lang|el|τουν}} {{IPA|[tun-]}} instead of {{lang|el|τούτο}} {{IPA|[tuto]}}{{clarify|reason=Probably NEU; if so, please state it explicitly. Similarly, if instead it's MASC (ACC) or both NEU and MASC (ACC).|date=April 2015}}
* different third person plural suffix in present and past tense {{IPA|[-usin]}} and {{IPA|[-asin]}} instead of {{IPA|[-un]}} and {{IPA|[-an]}}, respectively
* different second person plural morpheme in past tenses {{IPA|[-mete]}} instead of {{IPA|[-nate]}}{{clarify|reason=SMG [-nate]? In SMG, [-nate] means that the verb's root ends in n (the suffix is [-ate]). Does this mean that SMG 'lynate' is 'lymete' in CG changing the root? Or is this simply a typo and [-ate] (or [-gate] or [-sate]) was meant? Or is it a case of 'kano' vs 'kam(n)o'? In any case, what is the meaning of 'morpheme' in this context?|date=April 2015}} 
* syllabic [[augment (linguistics)|augment]] {{IPA|[e]}} in past tenses{{clarify|reason=Does this mean that it's universally applied? Cause SMG verbs also get syllabic augments, they just don't get them consistently or at all persons, or put in another way, consistency is found only when the augment is accented in non compound forms of the verbs.|date=April 2015}}
* different future particle {{lang|el|εννά}} {{IPA|[eˈnːa]}} instead of {{lang|el|θα}} {{IPA|[θa]}}
* different negation marker in non-indicative [[grammatical mood|mood]] {{lang|el|μεν}} {{IPA|[men]}} instead of {{lang|el|μη(ν)}} {{IPA|[mi(n)]}}

===Syntax===
The main syntactic differences between Standard Modern Greek and Cypriot Greek are the following:{{sfn|Hadjioannou|Tsiplakou|Kappler|2011|p=569}}
* [[clitic]] comes after the verb instead of before it when the verb is emphasized and in the beginning of the sentence, e.g. {{lang|el|είδες το}} {{IPA|[ˈiðes to]}} instead of {{lang|el|το είδες}} {{IPA|[to ˈiðes]}} "you saw it"
* obligatory [[cleft sentence|clefting]] in wh-questions induced by ''inda'', e.g. {{IPA|[ˈi&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;da &lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;bu ˈiðes]}} "what is it that you saw?" instead of {{IPA|[ti ˈiðes]}} "what did you see?"
* optional clefting in other wh-questions
* focus clefting (no focus movement), e.g. {{IPA|[e ˈ&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;di ˈkseɲːa &lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;bu ˈiðes]}} "it is Xenia that you saw" for {{IPA|[tin ˈkseɲa ˈiðes]}} "you saw Xenia"
* indirect before direct object with post-verbal clitics, e.g. {{IPA|[ˈstil mu to]}} "send me it" instead of {{IPA|[ˈstile ˈto mu]}} "send it to me"
--&gt;

==Vocabulary==
More loanwords are in everyday use than in Standard Modern Greek.{{sfn|Ammon|2006|p=1886}} These come from [[Old French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Occitan language|Provençal]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and, increasingly, from [[English language|English]]. There are also Arabic expressions like {{lang|el|μάσ̌σ̌αλλα}} {{IPA|[ˈmaʃːalːa]}} "[[mashallah]]" and {{lang|el|ίσ̌σ̌αλλα}} {{IPA|[ˈiʃːalːa]}} "[[inshallah]]". Much of the Cypriot core vocabulary is different to the modern standard's, e.g. {{lang|el|συντυχάννω}} {{IPA|[sindiˈxanːo]}} in addition to μιλώ "I talk", {{lang|el|θωρώ}} {{IPA|[θοˈɾo]}} instead of βλέπω "I look", etc. A historically interesting example is the occasional use of Archaic πόθεν instead of από που for the interrogative "from where?"

''[[Ethnologue]]'' reports that the [[lexical similarity]] between Cypriot Greek and [[Demotic Greek]] is in the range of 84–93%.&lt;ref&gt;{{e18|ell|Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no established orthography for Cypriot Greek.{{sfn|Arvaniti|1999|p=1}}{{sfn|Themistocleous|2010|p=158}} Efforts have been made to introduce [[diacritic]]s to the [[Greek alphabet]] to represent [[palato-alveolar consonant]]s found in Cypriot, but not in Standard Modern Greek, e.g. the [[caron|combining caron]] {{angle bracket|ˇ}}, by the authors of the [http://lexcy.library.ucy.ac.cy/Lexicon.aspx "Syntychies" lexicographic database] at the [[University of Cyprus]].{{sfn|Themistocleous|Katsoyannou|Armosti|Christodoulou|2012|pp=263–264}} When diacritics are not used, an epenthetic {{angle bracket|ι}}—often accompanied by the systematic substitution of the preceding consonant letter—may be used to the same effect (as in [[Polish language|Polish]]), e.g. Standard Modern Greek {{lang|el|παντζάρι}} {{IPA|[paˈ(n)d͡zaɾi]}} → Cypriot Greek {{lang|el|ππαντζ'''ι'''άρι}} {{IPA|[pʰːaˈnd͡ʒaɾi]}}, Standard Modern Greek {{lang|el|χέρι}} {{IPA|[ˈçeɾi]}} → Cypriot Greek {{lang|el|'''σι'''έρι}} {{IPA|[ˈʃeɾi]}}.

[[Geminate]]s (and [[Aspirated consonant|aspirates]]) are represented by two of the same letter, e.g. {{lang|el|σή'''μμ'''ερα}} {{IPA|[ˈsimːeɾa]}} "today", though this may not be done in cases where the spelling would not coincide with Standard Modern Greek's, e.g. {{lang|el|σήμμερα}} would still be spelt {{lang|el|σήμερα}}.{{efn|group=note|Geminates are present in Cypriot Greek and were present (and distinct) in Ancient and earlier Koine, but they are not in Standard Modern Greek. Late twentieth century spelling reforms in Greece were not indiscriminate, i.e. some words are still spelt with two consecutive consonant letters, but are not pronounced that way. In addition, Cypriot Greek has developed geminates in words where they were not previously found.}}

In [[computer-mediated communication]], Cypriot Greek, like Standard Modern Greek, is commonly written in the [[Latin script]],{{sfn|Themistocleous|2010|pp=158–159}} and English spelling conventions may be adopted for shared sounds,{{sfn|Themistocleous|2010|p=165}} e.g. {{angle bracket|sh}} for {{IPA|/ʃ/}} (and {{IPA|/ʃː/}}).

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2013}}

Cyprus was cut off from the rest of the Greek-speaking world from the 7th to the 10th century &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt; due to Arab attacks. It was reintegrated in the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 962 to be isolated again in 1191 when it fell to the hands of the [[Third Crusade|Crusaders]]. These periods of isolation led to the development of various linguistic characteristics distinct from [[Byzantine Greek]].

The oldest surviving written works in Cypriot date back to the [[Medieval period]]. Some of these are: the legal code of the [[Kingdom of Cyprus]], the [[Assizes of Jerusalem]]; the chronicles of [[Leontios Machairas]] and Georgios Voustronios; and a collection of sonnets in the manner of [[Francesco Petrarca]]. In the past hundred years, the dialect has been used in poetry (with major poets being [[Vasilis Michaelides]] and [[Dimitris Lipertis]]). It is also traditionally used in folk songs and {{lang|el|τσιαττιστά}} (battle poetry, a form of playing [[the Dozens]]) and the tradition of {{lang|el|ποιητάρηες}} (bards).

In the late seventies, Minister of Education [[Chrysostomos A. Sofianos]] upgraded the status of Cypriot by introducing it in education. More recently, it has been used in [[Music of Cyprus|music]], e.g. in reggae by Hadji Mike and in rap by several Cypriot hip hop groups, such as Dimiourgoi Neas Antilipsis (DNA). Locally produced television shows, usually comedies or soap operas, make use of the dialect, e.g. "Vourate Geitonoi" ({{lang|el|βουράτε}} instead of {{lang|el|τρέξτε}}) or "Oi Takkoi" ({{lang|el|Τάκκος}} being a uniquely Cypriot name). The 2006 feature film ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' features actor Jimmy Roussounis arguing in Cypriot with another crew member speaking [[Gibrizlidja]] (Cypriot Turkish) about a captain's hat they find in the sea. [[Peter Polycarpou]] routinely spoke in Cypriot in his role as Chris Theodopolopoudos in the British television comedy series ''[[Birds of a Feather]]''. In Episode 04 Season 01 of American TV series ''[[The Leftovers (TV series)|The Leftovers]]'' which aired on 20 July 2014, Alex Malaos's character uses the dialect saying ''"Εκατάλαβα σε".''

Today, Cypriot Greek is the only variety of Modern Greek with a significant presence of spontaneous use online, including [[blog]]s and [[internet forum]]s, and there exists a variant of [[Greeklish]] that reflects its distinct [[phonology]].

[[File:Open bible isaiah.jpg|thumb|A Bible open to the [[Book of Isaiah]]]]
'''Exegesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|k|s|ɪ|ˈ|dʒ|iː|s|ɪ|s}}; from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἐξήγησις}} from {{lang|grc|ἐξηγεῖσθαι}}, "to lead out") is a critical explanation or [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of a text, particularly a [[religious text]]. Traditionally the term was used primarily for work with the [[Bible]]; however, in modern usage "biblical exegesis" is used for greater specificity to distinguish it from any other broader critical text explanation.

Exegesis includes a wide range of critical disciplines: [[textual criticism]] is the investigation into the history and origins of the text, but exegesis may include the study of the historical and cultural backgrounds of the author, text, and original audience. Other analyses include classification of the type of [[literary genre]]s presented in the text and analysis of [[grammar|grammatical]] and [[syntax|syntactical]] features in the text itself.

The terms exegesis and [[hermeneutics]] have been used interchangeably.

==Usage==
One who practices exegesis is called an ''exegete'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|k|s|ɪ|ˈ|dʒ|iː|t}}; from Greek {{lang|grc|ἐξηγητής}}). The plural of exegesis is ''exegeses'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|k|s|ɪ|ˈ|dʒ|iː|s|iː|z}}).  Adjectives are exegetic or exegetical (e.g., exegetical commentaries). In biblical exegesis, the opposite of exegesis (to draw out) is [[eisegesis]] (to draw in), in the sense of an eisegetic commentator "importing" or "drawing in" his or her own purely subjective interpretations into the text, unsupported by the text itself. Eisegesis is often used as a derogatory term.

==Mesopotamian commentaries==
The earliest examples, and also one of the largest corpora of text commentaries from the ancient world, come from Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) in the first millennium BCE. Known from over 860 manuscripts, the majority of which date to the period 700–100 BCE, most of these commentaries explore numerous types of texts, including literary works (such as the [[Enûma Eliš|Babylonian Epic of Creation]]), medical treatises, magical texts, ancient dictionaries, and law collections (the [[Code of Hammurabi]]). Most of them, however, comment on divination treatises, in particular treatises that predict the future from the appearance and movement of celestial bodies on the one hand ([[Enūma Anu Enlil]]), and from the appearance of a sacrificed sheep’s liver on the other ([[Bārûtu]]).

As with the majority of the thousands of texts from the [[ancient Near East]] that have survived to the present day, Mesopotamian text commentaries are written on clay tablets in [[cuneiform script]]. Text commentaries are written in the East Semitic language of [[Akkadian (language)|Akkadian]], but due to the influence of lexical lists written in [[Sumerian language]] on cuneiform scholarship, they often contain Sumerian words or phrases as well.

Cuneiform commentaries are important because they provide information about Mesopotamian languages and culture that are not available elsewhere in the cuneiform record. To give but one example, the pronunciation of the cryptically written name of Gilgamesh, the hero of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], was discovered in a cuneiform commentary on a medical text.&lt;ref&gt;BM 54595 ([http://ccp.yale.edu/P461257 ''CCP'' 4.2.R]). See T. G. Pinches, “Exit Gišṭubar!”, ''The Babylonian and Oriental Record'', vol. 4, p. 264, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the significance of cuneiform commentaries extends beyond the light they shed on specific details of Mesopotamian civilization. They open a window onto what the concerns of the Mesopotamian literate elite were when they read some of the most widely studied texts in the Mesopotamian intellectual tradition, a perspective that is important for “seeing things their way.”&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Pollock, [http://doi.org/10.1086/599594 “Future Philology? The Fate of a Soft Science in a Hard World”, ''Critical Inquiry'' 35/4, pp. 931–961], here p. 954.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, cuneiform commentaries are also the earliest examples of textual interpretation. It has been repeatedly argued that they influenced rabbinical exegesis. See [http://ccp.yale.edu/introduction/akkadian-hebrew-exegesis Akkadian Commentaries and Early Hebrew Exegesis]

The publication and interpretation of these texts began in the mid-nineteenth century, with the discovery of the royal Assyrian libraries at Nineveh, from which ca. 454 text commentaries have been recovered. The study of cuneiform commentaries is, however, far from complete. It is the subject of on-going research by the small, international community of scholars who specialize in the field of [[Assyriology]].

==Bible commentaries==
{{See also|List of Biblical commentaries|Jewish commentaries on the Bible}}
A common published form of biblical exegesis is known as a Bible commentary and typically takes the form of a set of books, each of which is devoted to the [[wikt:exposition|exposition]] of one or two [[books of the Bible]]. Long books or those that contain much material either for theological or [[Historical criticism|historical-critical]] speculation, such as [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] or [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]], may be split over two or three volumes. Some, such as the [[Four Gospels]], may be multiple- or single-volume, while short books such as the [[deuterocanonical]] portions of [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Book of Esther|Esther]], and [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] (i.e. [[Book of Susanna]], [[Prayer of Azariah]], [[Bel and the Dragon]], [[Additions to Esther]], [[Book of Baruch|Baruch]] and the [[Epistle of Jeremiah]]), or the [[Pastoral epistles|pastoral]] or [[Johannine epistles]] are often condensed into one volume.

The form of each book may be identical or allow for variations in [[methodology]] between the many authors who collaborate to write a full commentary. Each book's commentary generally consists of a background and introductory section, followed by detailed commentary of the book [[pericope]]-by-pericope or verse-by-verse. Before the 20th century, a commentary would be written by a sole author, but today a publishing board will commission a team of scholars to write a commentary, with each volume being divided out among them.

A single commentary will generally attempt to give a coherent and unified view on the Bible as a whole, for example, from a [[Catholic]] or [[Reformed Churches|Reformed]] ([[Calvinist]]) perspective, or a commentary that focuses on [[textual criticism]] or [[historical criticism]] from a secular point of view. However, each volume will inevitably lean toward the personal emphasis of its author, and within any commentaries there may be great variety in the depth, accuracy, and critical or theological strength of each volume.

==Christianity==
{{See main|Biblical hermeneutics}}

===Views===
The main Christian exegetical methods are historical-grammatical, historical criticism, revealed, and rational.

The [[historical-grammatical method]] is a Christian [[Biblical hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] method that strives to discover the Biblical author's original intended meaning in the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Baker Book House | isbn = 0-8010-3413-2 | last = Elwell | first = Walter A. | title = [[Evangelical Dictionary of Theology]] | location = Grand Rapids, Mich. | year = 1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the primary method of interpretation for many conservative Protestant exegetes who reject the [[historical-critical method]] to various degrees (from the complete rejection of historical criticism of some [[fundamentalist]] Protestants to the moderated acceptance of it in the Catholic Church since [[Pope]] [[Pius XII]]),&lt;ref&gt;The Biblical Commission's Document "The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church" Text and Commentary; ed. Joseph A. Fitzmyer; Subsidia Biblica 18; Rome: Editrice Pontificio Istituto Bibllico, 1995. See esp. p. 26, "The historical-critical method is the indispensable method for the scientific study of the meaning of ancient texts."&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the overwhelming reliance on historical-critical interpretation, often to the exclusion of all other hermeneutics, in [[liberal Christianity]].

Historical criticism also known as the historical-critical method or [[higher criticism]], is a branch of literary criticism that investigates the origins of ancient texts in order to understand "the world behind the text".&lt;ref name="Handbook, 78"&gt;{{cite book|last=Soulen|first=Richard N.|title=Handbook of biblical criticism|year=2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Ky.|isbn=0-664-22314-1|edition=3rd ed., rev. and expanded.|author2=Soulen, R. Kendall|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://depts.drew.edu/jhc/&lt;/ref&gt;  This is done to discover the text's primitive or original meaning in its original historical context and its literal sense.&lt;ref name="Handbook, 79"&gt;{{cite book|last=Soulen|first=Richard N.|title=Handbook of Biblical Criticism|year=2001|publisher=John Knox|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revealed exegesis considers that the [[Holy Spirit]] [[Biblical inspiration|inspired]] the authors of the scriptural texts,{{cn|date=September 2014}} and so the words of those texts convey a divine [[revelation]]. In this view of exegesis, the principle of ''[[sensus plenior]]'' applies — that because of its divine authorship, the Bible has a "fuller meaning" than its human authors intended or could have foreseen.

Rational exegesis bases its operation on the idea that the authors have their own inspiration (in this sense, synonymous with [[artistic inspiration]]), so their works are completely and utterly a product of the social environment and human intelligence of their authors.{{cn|date=September 2014}}

===Catholic===
{{see also|Roman Catholic theology of Scripture}} 
Catholic centres of biblical exegesis include:
* the [[École Biblique]] of [[Jerusalem]] founded in 1890 by the [[Dominican order]]'s [[Marie-Joseph Lagrange]]. The school became embroiled in the [[modernist crisis]], and had to curtail its [[New Testament]] activities until after [[Vatican II]]
* the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]] of [[Rome]], a division of the [[Jesuit]] [[Gregorian University]], has influenced [[Roman Catholic theology of Scripture|Catholic exegesis]] through teaching and through the [[Pontifical Biblical Commission]]

===Protestant===
For more than a century, German universities such as [[Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen|Tübingen]] have had reputations as centers of exegesis; in the USA, the Divinity Schools of [[University of Chicago|Chicago]], [[Harvard Divinity School|Harvard]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] became famous.

&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of Protestant Christian exegesis.

==Judaism==
{{Main|Jewish commentaries on the Bible|Pardes (Jewish exegesis)}}

Traditional Jewish forms of exegesis appear throughout [[rabbinic literature]], which includes the [[Mishnah]], the two [[Talmud]]s, and the [[midrash]] literature.

Jewish exegetes have the title ''mefarshim'' {{Hebrew|מפרשים}} (commentators).

===Midrash===
The [[Midrash]] is a [[homiletic]] method of exegesis and a compilation of homiletic teachings or commentaries on the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), a biblical exegesis of the [[Pentateuch]] and its paragraphs related to the Law or [[Torah]], which also forms an object of analysis. It comprises the legal and ritual [[Halakha]], the collective body of Jewish laws, and exegesis of the written Law; and the non-legalistic [[Aggadah]], a compendium of Rabbinic homilies of the parts of the [[Pentateuch]] not connected with Law.

Biblical interpretation by the [[Tannaim]] and the [[Amoraim]], which may be best designated as scholarly interpretations of the Midrash, was a product of natural growth and of great freedom in the treatment of the words of the Bible. However, it proved an obstacle to further development when, endowed with the authority of a sacred tradition in the [[Talmud]] and in the Midrash (collections edited subsequently to the Talmud), it became the sole source for the interpretation of the Bible among later generations. Traditional literature contains explanations that are in harmony with the wording and the context. It reflects evidence of linguistic sense, judgment, and an insight into the peculiarities and difficulties of the biblical text. But side by side with these elements of a natural and simple Bible exegesis, of value even today, the traditional literature contains an even larger mass of expositions removed from the actual meaning of the text.

;Halakha and Aggadah
In the [[halakhic]] as well as in the [[haggadic]] exegesis the [[wikt:expounder|expounder]] endeavored not so much to seek the original meaning of the text as to find authority in some Bible passage for concepts and ideas, rules of conduct and teachings, for which he wished to have a biblical foundation. The [[talmudical hermeneutics]] form ''[[Asmachta (Talmudical hermeneutics)|asmachta]]'' is defined as finding hints for a given law rather than basing on the bible text. To this were added, on the one hand, the belief that the words of the Bible had many meanings, and, on the other, the importance attached to the smallest portion, the slightest [[wikt:peculiarity|peculiarity]] of the text. Because of this move towards particularities the exegesis of the [[Midrash]] strayed further and further away from a natural and [[common-sense]] interpretation.&lt;!--reflects a Catholic/Christian viewpoint, I suspect. Also some Jewish scholars would agree, but not all--&gt;
;Midrash
Midrash exegesis was largely in the nature of [[homiletics]], expounding the Bible not in order to investigate its actual meaning and to understand the documents of the past but to find religious [[wikt:edification|edification]], moral instruction, and sustenance for the thoughts and feelings of the present. The contrast between explanation of the literal sense and the Midrash, that did not  follow the words, was recognized by the Tannaim and the [[Amoraim]], although their idea of the literal meaning of a biblical passage may not be allowed by more modern standards. The above-mentioned [[Tannaim|tanna]], [[Ishmael b. Elisha]] said, rejecting an exposition of [[Eliezer b. Hyrcanus]]: "Truly, you say to Scripture, 'Be silent while I am expounding!'" ([[Sifra]] on Lev. xiii. 49).
;Tannaim
[[Tannaim|Tannaitic]] exegesis distinguishes principally between the actual deduction of a thesis from a Bible passage as a means of proving a point, and the use of such a passage as a mere [[mnemonic]] device – a distinction that was also made in a different form later in the [[Babylon]]ian schools. The Babylonian [[Amoraim]] were the first to use the expression "[[Peshaṭ]]" ("simple" or face value method) to designate the primary sense, contrasting it with the "Drash," the [[Midrashic]] exegesis. These two terms were later on destined to become important features in the history of [[Jew]]ish Bible exegesis. In [[Babylonia]] was formulated the important principle that the [[Midrashic]] exegesis could not annul the primary sense. This principle subsequently became the watchword of commonsense Bible exegesis. How little it was known or recognized may be seen from the admission of [[Kahana b. Tahlifa|Kahana]], a Babylonian [[Amoraim|amora]] of the fourth century, that while at 18 years of age he had already learned the whole [[Mishnah]], he had only heard of that principle a great many years later ([[Shab]] 63a). Kahana's admission is characteristic of the centuries following the final redaction of the Talmud. The primary meaning is no longer considered, but it becomes more and more the fashion to interpret the text according to the meaning given to it in traditional literature. The ability and even the desire for original investigation of the text succumbed to the overwhelming authority of the [[Midrash]]. It was, therefore, providential that, just at the time when the Midrash was paramount, the close study of the text of the Bible, at least in one direction, was pursued with rare energy and perseverance by the [[Masorites]], who set themselves to preserving and transmitting the pronunciation and correct reading of the text. By introducing punctuation ([[vowel-points]] and [[Diacritic|accents]]) into the biblical text, in the seventh century, they supplied that protecting hedge which, according to [[Rabbi Akiva]]'s saying, the [[Masoretic Text|Masorah]] was to be for the words of the Bible. Punctuation, on the one hand, protected the tradition from being forgotten, and, on the other, was the precursor of an independent Bible science to be developed in a later age.

===Mikra===
The [[Tanakh|Mikra]], the fundamental part of the national science, was the subject of the primary instruction. It was also divided into the three historic groups of the books of the [[Bible]]: the [[Pentateuch]], the [[Prophets in Judaism|Prophets]], and the [[Hagiographa]], called in traditional Hebrew attribution the [[Torah]] (the Law or Teaching), the [[Nevi'im]] (the Prophets) and the [[Kethuvim]] (the Writings) respectively. The intelligent reading and comprehension of the text, arrived at by a correct division of the sentences and words, formed the course of instruction in the Bible. The scribes were also required to know the Targum, the Aramaic translation of the text. The Targum made possible an immediate comprehension of the text, but was continuously influenced by the exegesis taught in the schools. The synagogues were preeminently the centers for instruction in the Bible and its exegesis. The reading of the biblical text, which was combined with that of the Targum, served to widen the knowledge of the scholars learned in the first division of the national science. The scribes found the material for their discourses, which formed a part of the synagogue service, in the second division of the several branches of the tradition. The Haggadah, the third of these branches, was the source material for the sermon.

Jewish exegesis did not finish with the redaction of the [[Talmud]], but continued during ancient times, the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]; it remains a subject of study today. Jews have centres for exegetic studies around the world, in each community: they consider exegesis an important tool for the understanding of the Scriptures.

==Indian philosophy==
The [[Mimamsa]] school of [[Indian philosophy]], also known as {{IAST|''Pūrva Mīmāṃsā''}} ("prior" inquiry, also {{IAST|''Karma-Mīmāṃsā''}}), in contrast to  {{IAST|''Uttara Mīmāṃsā''}} ("posterior" inquiry, also {{IAST|''Brahma-Mīmāṃsā''}}), is strongly concerned with textual exegesis, and consequently gave rise to the study of [[philology]] and the [[philosophy of language]]. Its notion of [[shabda]] "speech" as indivisible   unity of sound and meaning ([[signifier and signified]]) is due to [[Bhartrhari]] (7th century).&lt;ref&gt;see also chapter 3.2 in Peter M. Scharf, ''The Denotation of Generic Terms in Ancient Indian Philosophy'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tafsir]] ({{lang-ar|تفسير}}, ''tafsīr'', "interpretation") is the Arabic word for exegesis or commentary, usually of the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=al-Baydawi's "Anwar al-Tanzil wa Asrar al-Ta'wil" with Frontispiece|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/6803|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An author of tafsīr is a ''mufassir'' ({{lang-ar|'مُفسر}}, ''mufassir'', plural: {{lang-ar|مفسرون}}, ''mufassirūn'').

Tafsir does not include [[Esotericism|esoteric]] or [[Islamic mysticism|mystical]] interpretations, which are covered by the related word ''[[Ta'wil]]''. [[Shi'a|Shi'ite]] organization [[Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project]] cites the Islamic [[Prophets in Islam|prophet]] [[Muhammad]] as stating that the Qur'an has an inner meaning, and that this inner meaning conceals an even deeper inner meaning, in support of this view.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project]], [http://www.al-islam.org/quraninislam/2.htm The Teachings of the Qur'an] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616082040/http://www.al-islam.org/quraninislam/2.htm |date=2006-06-16 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of people for [[Sufism]] and [[Ilm al-Kalam]] pioneered this thought.

== Zoroastrianism==
[[Exegesis in Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian exegesis]] consists basically of the interpretation of the [[Avesta]]. However, the closest equivalent Iranian concept, zand, generally includes Pahlavi texts which were believed to derive from commentaries upon Avestan scripture, but whose extant form contains no Avestan passages. Zoroastrian exegesis differs from similar phenomena in many other religions in that it developed as part of a religious tradition which made little or no use of writing until well into the [[Sasanian]] era. This lengthy period of oral transmission has clearly helped to give the Middle Persian Zand its characteristic shape and has, in a sense, limited its scope. Although the later tradition makes a formal distinction between “Gathic” (gāhānīg), “legal” (dādīg), and perhaps “ritual” (hādag-mānsrīg) Avestan texts, there appear to be no significant differences in approach between the Pahlavi commentary on the [[Gathas]] and those on dādīg texts, such as the ''Vendīdād'', the ''Hērbedestān and the Nērangestān''.  Since many 19th and 20th century works by Zoroastrians contain an element of exegesis, while on the other hand no exegetical literature in the strict sense of the word can be said to exist, the phenomenon of modern Zoroastrian exegesis as such will be discussed here, without detailed reference to individual texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kreyenbroek|first=Philip G.|title=EXEGESIS i. In Zoroastrianism|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Iranica]]|volume= IX, Fasc. 2|year=1999|location=Costa Mesa|publisher=Mazda|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/exegesis-i|page= 113–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In a secular context==
Several universities, including the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in Paris,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ephe.sorbonne.fr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=164&amp;Itemid=244|title=Ecole pratique des hautes études (EPHE)|work=sorbonne.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leiden University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universiteitsgids.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?c=169|title=Organisatie|work=leidenuniv.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Université Libre de Bruxelles]]'' (Free University of Brussels),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ulb.ac.be/philo/cierl/|title=Centre interdisciplinaire d'étude des religions et de la laïcité – CIERL|work=ulb.ac.be|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112032735/http://www.ulb.ac.be/philo/cierl/|archivedate=2007-11-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; put exegesis in a secular context, next to exegesis in a religious tradition. Secular exegesis is an element of the [[study of religion]].

At Australian universities, the exegesis is part of practice-based [[doctorate]] projects. It is a scholarly text accompanying a film, literary text, etc. produced by the PhD. candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krauth|first=Nigel|title=Evolution of the exegesis: the radical trajectory of the creative writing doctorate in Australia|journal=Text: Journal of writing and writing courses|year=2011|volume=15|issue=1|url=http://www.textjournal.com.au/april11/krauth.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Lee Woodward''' (1871–1952)&lt;ref name="BS"/&gt; was an English educationist, [[Pali]] scholar, author and [[theosophist]]. Woodward studied and researched on [[Theravada Buddhism]] and wrote numerous work based on them. He is admired among the Pali scholars for compiling the vast concordance of [[Pali canon]] by translating eighteen of the forty-two volumes of the Pali texts into English.&lt;ref name="AB"/&gt; He also served as the principal of Buddhist school [[Mahinda College]], [[Galle]] in [[Ceylon]] for 16 years from 1903 to 1919. Woodward lived his latter stage of life in Rowella, [[Tasmania]], mainly spending his time on studies and translation work.

==Early life and education==
F. L. Woodward was born on 13 April 1871 at [[Saham Toney]] in [[Norfolk]], England, as the third son of William Woodward, an [[Anglican]] vicar, and his wife Elizabeth Mary Ann. Woodward had an archetypal Victorian boyhood and began to study the languages Latin, Greek, French and German by the age of eight. He joined the traditional English public school Christ's Hospital (the Bluecoat School), [[London]] in 1879, where he later won the Latin and French prizes on three occasions. Woodward also did well in athletics at his school and won prizes for many athletic events. He did specially well in [[Shot put|Putting the weight]], where he held the records for several years.&lt;ref name=obo/&gt; Woodward won a scholarship to [[Sidney Sussex College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] at the age of eighteen and won the distinction as a classical scholar, sportsman and organist there. He was also the captain of the Rugby football team, vice-captain of Boats and was a full-back of the Soccer team of Sydney Sussex College.&lt;ref name=obo/&gt;

He received [[B.A.]] in 1893 and [[M.A.]] in 1902 and later turned to teaching and taught in several English public schools which secured him a deputy headmaster-ship. Woodward began his teaching career at Rugby Preparatory School, where he served for a short period as an assistant master. Later he taught for three years  at the [[Royal Grammar School, Worcester]] until 1897 as classics master. Woodward then joined [[Stamford School]], [[Lincolnshire]], where he served for five years as the second master. During his five-year period at Stamford school he spend a great deal of his time for the study of both Western and Eastern philosophy, Pali and [[Sanskrit]], English literature, and religion.&lt;ref name=obo/&gt;  Woodward joined the [[London Lodge|London Theosophical Society]] in 1902, and became a friend and follower of Col. [[Henry Steel Olcott]], the co-founder and first President of the Theosophical Society. In 1903 Col.Olcott offered him the principal-ship of Mahinda College, Galle, Ceylon which was then administered by the Buddhist Theosophical Society of Galle, Ceylon.&lt;ref name="AB"&gt;{{cite web|last= Heyward |first=Nigel|url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120636b.htm|title=Woodward, Frank Lee (1871 - 1952)|accessdate=2010-08-15|year=1990|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodward accepted the principalship of Mahinda College which he nursed for the next 16 years of his life.&lt;ref name=obo/&gt;

==Principal of Mahinda College==
F. L. Woodward was the principal of Mahinda College from 1903 to 1919. His work at Mahinda College included taking classes in English, Latin, [[Pali]], Buddhism and Art, in addition to the administrative duties related with the head mastership of the school. With the assistance of [[E. R. Gooneratne|Mudaliyar Gunaratne]], Muhandiram Thomas Amarasuriya, Muhandiram Wickremasinghe and the charitable Buddhist public of Galle, Woodward relocated Mahinda College from bussy [[Galle fort]] to its present site, which is more suited for a school. His involvement went much further as he was the designer and architect of its buildings, personally supervised their construction, and often worked alongside the masons. 
During the tenure of Woodward, the school had grown rapidly and became one of the leading colleges in the [[Southern Sri Lanka]]. Although he was a strict disciplinarian, his students greatly idolised him.

While working in Sri Lanka, he edited the Buddhist, the leading Buddhist magazine of the island at the time, and  went to [[Madra]]s each year for the annual convention of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]]. Woodward advised the director of education in Ceylon often during his work and was actively involved with the movement for establishing a [[University]] in Ceylon. [[Sinhalese language]] was accepted as a subject for the [[Cambridge International Examinations|Cambridge local examinations]] due to his efforts. He decided to leave Mahinda College in 1919 due to the tropical climate, which was having a bad impact on his health.&lt;ref name=obo&gt;[http://obo.genaud.net/backmatter/gallery/woodward.htm Biographies-Frank Lee Woodward], Obo the Awakener&lt;/ref&gt; He migrated to Tasmania to live the remaining part of his life with the intention of translating the Pali Canon into English language.

==Retirement in Tasmania==
Woodward settled in [[Tasmania]], and bought a small apple orchard and a cottage from a fellow Theosophist, situated on the Tamar River 40&amp;nbsp;km from [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]],&lt;ref name=obo/&gt; from where [[Ben Lomond (Tasmania)|Ben Lomond]], one of the highest peaks in Tasmania, can be seen. In this peaceful setting he resumed his studies on Buddhism and translations for the [[Pali Text Society]], established by [[Thomas Rhys Davids]] in 1881. He lived alone, surrounded by Buddhist scriptures on thousands of [[ola leaves]] and practiced [[yoga]] and [[meditation]].&lt;ref name="AB"/&gt; Although he preferred isolation, he developed friendships with his close neighbors and was liked by the local children, who were given sweets by Woodward on his visits to the store. A vegetarian and animal lover, he surprised his neighbours with his fondness for the snakes of the area.&lt;ref name=obo/&gt;

In his final years, his orchard became neglected and he was reduced to near poverty. Woodward only left his home town two or three times a year, usually to take part in some activity of the local branch of the Theosophical Society. His work ''Some Sayings of the Buddha'', has contributed to a wider understanding of Buddhism in the western world. An erudite Pali scholar and translator, he translated eighteen of the forty-two volumes of the Pali texts into English and compiled the vast concordance of the [[Pali canon]].&lt;ref name="AB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jayetilleke|first=Rohan L.|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727070753/http://www.lakehouse.lk/budusarana/2007/01/03/Budu17.pdf|title=Frank Lee Woodward erudite Pali scholar and translator |accessdate=2010-08-15|date= January 3, 2007|publisher=Budu Sarana}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, after the publication of 15 volumes of a complete translation of the Digha, Majjhima, Samyutta and Anguttara Nikaya, [[Caroline Rhys Davids]] admired Woodward greatly for his untiring work for which he never expected any reward. Woodward died on 27 May 1952 at Beaconsfield Hospital, West Tamar, at the age of 81. He was buried in Carr Villa cemetery, Launceston.

In [[professional wrestling]], a '''face''' ('''babyface''') is a heroic or a "good guy" wrestler, [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|booked]] (scripted) by the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promotion|promotion]] with the aim of being cheered by fans.&lt;ref name=torchterms&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/insiderglossary.shtml|title=Torch Glossary of Insider Terms|publisher=PWTorch.com|accessdate=2007-07-10|year=2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606073745/http://www.pwtorch.com/insiderglossary.shtml|archivedate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, they wrestle within the rules and avoid cheating (in contrast to the villains who use illegal moves and call in additional wrestlers to do their work for them) while behaving positively towards the [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] and the audience. Such characters are also referred to as "blue-eyes" in [[Professional wrestling in the United Kingdom|British wrestling]] and ''técnicos'' in ''[[lucha libre]]''. The face character is portrayed as a [[hero]] relative to the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] wrestlers, who are analogous to [[villain]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.2)&lt;/ref&gt; Not everything a face wrestler does must be heroic: faces need only to be cheered by the audience to be effective characters.

The vast majority of wrestling storylines involving faces place a face against a heel, although more elaborate set-ups (such as two faces being manipulated by a nefarious outside party into fighting) often happen as well. In the world of ''lucha libre'' wrestling, they are generally known for using moves requiring technical skill, particularly aerial maneuvers and wearing outfits using bright colors with positive associations (such as [[White (color)|solid white]]). This is contrasted with the villainous ''rudos'' that are generally known for being brawlers, using physical moves that emphasize brute strength or size while often having outfits akin to [[demon]]s or other nasty characters.

== History ==
[[File:ReyMysterio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Wrestler [[Rey Mysterio]], seen here at a house show in 2005, is an example of a pure face who has played heroic roles for almost his entire career, with his ''[[lucha libre]]'' inspired outfit prominently displaying [[Christian cross]]es]]
Traditional faces are classic "good guy" characters who rarely break the rules, follow instructions of those in [[Professional wrestling authority figures|authority]] such as the referee, are polite and well-mannered towards the fans and often overcome the rule-breaking actions of their heel opponents to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Clean finish|cleanly]] win matches.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} While many modern faces still fit this model, other versions of the face character are now also common. A good example would be [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], who despite playing a heel early on in his career would start to be seen more of an [[antihero]] because of his popularity with the fans. While clearly not championing rule following, nor submission to authority, Austin was still regarded as the face in many of his duels such as his rivalry with [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, later WWE) owner [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]].

The portrayal of face wrestlers changed in the 1990s with the birth of [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW), the start of [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s (WCW) [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) storyline, and [[the Attitude Era]]  of the WWF. During this time, wrestlers like Stone Cold Steve Austin and [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] used tactics traditionally associated with heels, but remained popular with the fans.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Conversely, [[Kurt Angle]] was introduced to the then-WWF with an American [[hero]] [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] based on his [[Wrestling at the 1996 Summer Olympics|gold medal win]] at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]]. Angle presented himself as a [[role model]] and stressed the need to work hard to realize one's dreams.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Although such a personality appears appropriate for a face wrestler, Angle's character was arrogant and constantly reminded people of his Olympic glory, behaving as if he thought he was better than the fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/angle.html|title=Kurt Angle|last=Kamchen|first=Richard|author2=Milner, John|accessdate=January 6, 2011|work=Slam! Sports|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angle's character served as a meta-reference to how wrestling had changed. Although his character was intended to be a heel and behaved accordingly, some commentators speculated that if Angle attempted to get [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Over|over]] as a face using a more heroic version of the same character, he would have failed. Unusually, Angle did not use any of these heroic mannerisms when playing a face character, instead acting as somewhat of an antihero with a few elements of the "lovable loser" character archetype.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Fans sometimes dislike face wrestlers despite the way they are promoted. Some reasons for this include repetitive in-ring antics, a limited moveset, a lengthy title reign, [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#no-sell|lack of]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Sell|selling]] their opponents' moves, or an uninteresting character. This often results in wrestlers who are supposed to be cheered receiving a negative or no reaction from the fans.

The majority of the time, faces who are low-carders, or lesser known, are used as [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobbers]]. These wrestlers usually lose matches against established wrestlers, usually heels that would then lose to the top faces.

Some face wrestlers would often give high fives or give out merchandise to fans while entering the ring before their match, such as T-shirts, sunglasses, hats and masks. [[Bret Hart]] was one of the first superstars to make this popular, as he would drape his signature sunglasses on a child in the audience. [[Rey Mysterio]], who has been a face in WWE since his debut, would go to any fan (frequently a child) wearing a replica of his mask and touch their head with his head for good luck before wrestling. Other examples include [[John Cena]] throwing his shirts and caps in the crowd before entering a match and [[Big Show]] giving his hat to a fan when he was a face. After becoming a face, [[Alberto Del Rio]] would give his signature scarf to a fan before entering the ring, and [[Becky Lynch]] also gives one of her steam punk goggles to a young fan, and sometimes gives one of them to some of her fans before entering the ring, 

Some faces, such as Bret Hart and [[Ricky Steamboat]], promoted an image as a "family man" and supported their persona by appearing with their family members before and after matches. Steamboat famously carried his 8 month old son [[Richie Steamboat|Richard Jr.]] into the ring with him at [[WrestleMania IV]] before his match with [[Greg Valentine|Greg "The Hammer" Valentine]], then handing him to his wife Bonnie before the match started. These actions often relate to wrestlers promoting charity work or other actions outside the ring, blurring the lines between scripted wrestling and their personal lives.

A '''feature film''' is a [[film]] (also called a '''motion picture''' or '''movie''') with a [[feature length|running time]] long enough to be considered the principal or sole film to fill a program. The notion of how long this should be has varied according to time and place. According to the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], the [[American Film Institute]] and the [[British Film Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/archive-collections/bfi-filmography-faq|title=FAQ|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|access-date=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a feature film runs for at least 40 minutes, while the [[Screen Actors Guild]] asserts that a feature's running time is 80 minutes or longer.

Most feature films are between 70 and 210 minutes long. The first narrative feature film was the 60-minute ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' (1906, Australia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/story-kelly-gang/notes/ | title=The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906) | work=Australian Screen | accessdate=May 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first (proto)-feature-length [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] was ''[[Les Misérables (1909 film)|Les Misérables]]'' (1909, U.S.). Other early feature films include ''[[L'Inferno (film)|The Inferno (L'Inferno)]]'' (1911), ''[[Defence of Sevastopol]]'' (1911), ''[[Quo Vadis (1913 film)|Quo Vadis?]]'' (1913), ''[[Oliver Twist (1912 film)|Oliver Twist]]'' (1912), ''[[Richard III (1912 film)|Richard III]]'' (1912), ''[[From the Manger to the Cross]]'' (1912) and ''[[Cleopatra (1912 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1912).

== History ==
[[File:The Story of the Kelly Gang 1906.jpg|thumb|Actor playing the Australian [[bushranger]] [[Ned Kelly]] in ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' (1906), the world's first dramatic feature-length film.]]
The term ''feature film'' came into use to refer to the main film presented in a cinema and the one which was promoted or advertised. The term was used to distinguish the longer film from the [[short film]]s (referred to as shorts) typically presented before the main film, such as [[newsreel]]s, [[Serial (film)|serials]], [[animated cartoon]]s, live-action comedies, and documentaries. There was no sudden increase in the running times of films to the present-day definitions of feature-length; the "featured" film on a film program in the early 1910s gradually expanded from two to three to four reels.

Early features had been produced in the United States and France, but were released in individual (short film) scenes. This left exhibitors the option of playing them alone, to view an incomplete combination of some films, or to run them all together as a short film series. The American company [[Siegmund Lubin|S. Lubin]] released a [[Passion Play]] titled [[Lubin's Passion Play]] in January 1903 in 31 parts, totaling about 60 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;''Passion Play" (1903), in: The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures [online database].&lt;/ref&gt; The French company [[Pathé|Pathé Frères]] released a different Passion Play, ''[[Vie et Passion du Christ|The Life and Passion of Jesus Christ]]'', in May 1903 in 32 parts running about 44 minutes. There were also full-length records of boxing matches, such as ''[[The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight]]'' (1897),&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Musser]], ''The Emergence of Cinema: The American Screen to 1907'', pp. 197–200.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Reproduction Of The Corbett-Jeffries Fight]]'' (1899), and ''[[The Jeffries-Sharkey Fight]]'' (1899). Some consider the 100-minute ''The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight'' to be the first documentary feature film, but it is more accurately characterized as a sports program as it included the full unedited boxing match.

In 1900, the documentary film ''In the Army'' was made. It was over 1 hour in length and was about the training techniques of the British soldier.

Defined by length, the first dramatic feature film was the [[Australia]]n 70-minute film ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' (1906).&lt;ref name="PatrickRobertson"&gt;Patrick Robertson, ''Film Facts'', New York: Billboard Books, 2001, p. 9. {{ISBN|0-8230-7943-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the first European feature was the 90-minute film ''[[L'Enfant prodigue (film)|L'Enfant prodigue]]'' (France, 1907), although that was an unmodified record of a stage play; Europe's first feature adapted directly for the screen, ''[[Les Misérables (1909 film)|Les Misérables]]'', came from France in 1909.&lt;ref name="PatrickRobertson" /&gt; The first Russian feature was ''[[Defence of Sevastopol]]'' in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Robertson, ''Film Facts'', New York: Billboard Books, 2001, p. 13. {{ISBN|0-8230-7943-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Early Italian features were ''[[L'Inferno (film)|The Inferno (L'Inferno)]]'' (1911), ''[[Quo Vadis (1913 film)|Quo Vadis?]]'' (1913), ''[[Gli Ultimi giorni di Pompeii|The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1913), and ''[[Cabiria]]'' (1914). The first UK features were the documentary ''[[With Our King and Queen Through India]]'' (1912), filmed in [[Kinemacolor]]&lt;ref&gt;Charles Urban, ''A Yank in Britain: The Lost Memoirs of Charles Urban, Film Pioneer'', The Projection Box, 1999, p. 79. {{ISBN|978-0-9523941-2-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Oliver Twist (1912 film)|Oliver Twist]]'' (1912).&lt;ref name="PatrickRobertson" /&gt; The first American features were adaptations of ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' (1912), ''[[From the Manger to the Cross]]'' (1912), ''[[Cleopatra (1912 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1912), and ''[[Richard III (1912 film)|Richard III]]'' (1912). The latter starring actor [[Frederick Warde]] starred in some of these movie adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Robertson, ''Film Facts'', New York: Billboard Books, 2001, p. 10. {{ISBN|0-8230-7943-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Asian cinema|Asian feature]] was Japan's ''The Life Story of Tasuke Shiobara'' (1912),&lt;ref name="PatrickRobertson_a"&gt;Patrick Robertson, ''Film Facts'', New York: Billboard Books, 2001, pp. 10–14. {{ISBN|0-8230-7943-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the first [[Cinema of India|Indian feature]] was ''[[Raja Harishchandra]]'' (1913),&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Robertson, ''Film Facts'', New York: Billboard Books, 2001, p. 12. {{ISBN|0-8230-7943-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the first South American feature was Brazil's ''O Crime dos Banhados'' (1913),&lt;ref name="PatrickRobertson_a" /&gt; and the first African feature was South Africa's ''Die Voortrekkers'' (1916).&lt;ref name="PatrickRobertson_a" /&gt; 1913 also saw China's first feature film, Zhang Shichuan's ''Nan Fu Nan Qi''.

By 1915 over 600 feature films were produced annually in the United States.&lt;ref name="AmericanFilm"&gt;American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures [online database].&lt;/ref&gt; It is often incorrectly cited that ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915) was the first American feature film.&lt;ref&gt;"'The Birth of a Nation' was the first feature and the first film shown at the White House." ''Movies Silently.''

Since 1971, the country with the highest feature output has been [[India]],&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Robertson, ''Film Facts'', New York: Billboard Books, 2001, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; which produces a thousand films in more than twelve [[Languages of India|Indian languages]] each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Nelmes|first=Jill|title=An introduction to film studies|edition=3rd|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2003|isbn=0-415-26268-2|chapter=10|page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological developments==
[[File:The Jazz Singer 1927 Poster.jpg|thumb|A poster for [[The Jazz Singer]] (1927) the first feature film to use recorded sound.]]In 1927, [[Warner Bros.]] released the first feature-length film with sound, ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', whose audio track was recorded with a proprietary technology called [[Vitaphone]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carringer|first1=Robert L|title=The Jazz Singer|date=1979|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|location=Wisconsin|isbn=978-0299076641|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's success persuaded other studios to go to the considerable expense of adding microphones to their sets, and scramble to start producing their own "[[talkies]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/lkingygvr/sound/0|title=100 Ideas That Changed Film: Sound|last=Parkinson|first=David|date=18 April 2012|website=Credo Reference|publisher=Laurence King|access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the next major advancements made in movie production was [[color film]]. Even before color was a possibility in movies, early film makers were interested in how color could enhance their stories.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/lkingygvr/color/0|title="Color" 100 Ideas That Changed Film|last=Parkinson|first=David|date=18 April 2012|website=Credo Reference|publisher=Laurence King|access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early techniques included [[hand tinting]]: painting each frame by hand.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cheaper and more widely used was [[Photographic print toning|toning]]: dying the film in a signal color, used in a large number of films in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The film processing lab [[Technicolor]] developed the Three-Tone coloring technique that became the standard for color film. It was a complex, time consuming, and expensive process that many movie studios were not eager to try.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/mcfav/technicolor/0|title="Technicolor." A/v A to Z: An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Media, Entertainment and Other Audiovisual Terms|last=Kroon|first=Richard W.|date=2010|website=Credo Reference|publisher=McFarland|access-date=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the early adopters of the three-strip process was [[Disney]]. Some of the most notable films [[Technicolor]] processed with three-strip were ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Digital Video]] (or DV) has quickly changed how most films are made.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/lkingygvr/digital_video/0.|title="Digital Video." 100 Ideas That Changed Film|last=Parkinson|first=David|date=2012|website=Credo Reference|publisher=Credo Reference|access-date=24 Nov 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; First used to create special effects and animated movies, digital cameras became more common on film sets in the late 1990s. In 2002, [[George Lucas]]' ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'' became the first major feature-length film to be shot entirely on digital cameras.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{dead link|date=April 2018}} The ability to instantly play back footage and quickly transfer footage to computers for editing helped to speed up post-production time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Digital film making was given a big boost in 2005 when the [[Digital Cinema Initiative]] created a guide for manufacturers to create a universal standard, to make the technologies more compatible with each other and more user friendly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/mcfav/digital_cinema_dcinema_d_cinema/0|title=Digital Cinema; A/v A to Z: An Encyclopedic Dictionary of Media, Entertainment and Other Audiovisual Terms|last=Kroon|first=Richard W.|date=2014|website=Credo Reference|publisher=McFarland|access-date=24 Nov 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; shooting movies on digital also lead to new technologies for distributing films. ''[[Titan A.E.]]'', released in 2000, was the first feature film to be released for viewing over the internet.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Digital distribution changed the ways people received and watched media. It also gave viewers access to huge amounts of online content on demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Distribution Revolution : Conversations about the Digital Future of Film and Television|author=Curtin, Michael|author2=Holt, Jennifer|author3=Sanson, Kevin|last-author-amp=yes|publisher=University of California Press|year=2014|isbn=9780520959088|location=Berkeley, US|pages=165|via=SFC Library Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guaymí''', or '''Ngäbere''', also known as Movere, Chiriquí, and Valiente, is spoken by the indigenous [[Guaymí people|Ngäbe]] people in [[Panama]] and [[Costa Rica]].  The people refer to themselves as ''Ngäbe'' (pronounced {{IPA-xx|ˈŋɔbe|}}) and to their language as ''Ngäbere'' {{IPA|[ŋɔˈbeɾe]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Lininger Ross, B. (1981). Estudios Sobre el Guaymí Ngäbere: Fonologia, Alfabeto Y Diccionario Provisional. Revista De Filología y Lingüística De La Universidad De Costa Rica, 7)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ngäbes are the most populous of Panama’s several indigenous peoples.
The language is centered in Panama within the semi-autonomous indigenous reservation known as the [[Ngöbe-Buglé Comarca|Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé]]. Beginning in the 1950s, Costa Rica began to receive Ngäbe immigrants, where they are found in several indigenous reservations: Abrojos Montezuma, Conteburica, Coto Brus, Guaymí de Alto Laguna de Osa, and Altos de San Antonio.&lt;ref&gt;Murillo Miranda, J. M. (2009). The nominal phrase ngäbére. Forma y Función, 22(2), 43-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language family and dialects==

Ngäbere is part of the [[Chibchan languages|Chibchan language]] family, which is indigenous to an area that extends from eastern Honduras to northern Colombia. Ngäbere is one of two languages classified under a group called Guaymí.  The other is a related but mutually unintelligible language called [[Buglere language|Buglere]], spoken by the Buglé people within the Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé.&lt;ref&gt;Constenla Umaña, A. (1981). Comparative Chibchan Phonology. (Ph.D. dissertation, Department of Linguistics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia).
 (1991). Las lenguas del Área Intermedia: Introducción a su estudio areal (Languages of the Intermediate Area: Introduction to its area study). San José: Universidad de Costa Rica.

Boletín del Museo del Oro (38-39), 13-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

While all varieties of Ngäbere are grammatically identical and mutually intelligible, there are phonological and lexical differences that vary from region to region.  The people of different regions may use different words for the same concept or pronounce the same word differently.&lt;ref&gt;Rolando Rodríguez, personal communication, December 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Vowel sounds may change; for example, the word for “to see” that is pronounced /toen/ in some regions may be pronounced /tuen/ in other areas; the word for “you” may be pronounced /mä/ or /ma/ depending on the region.  Syllable stress may also vary regionally—for instance, the word for “dove,” ''ütü'', may be pronounced with the accent on the first syllable, or with equal strong accents on both syllables, depending on the speaker’s region.&lt;ref&gt;R. Mendoza, personal communication, June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The Penonomeño was somewhat more distinct, but is no longer spoken.

Ngäbere is directly referred to as ''dialecto'' (dialect) frequently by both Ngäbes and Latinos. Rolando Rodríguez remarks on this misnomer: “El ngäbere no es una variedad del español o de otra lengua conocida, de manera que por desconocimiento se suele decir dialecto al ngäbere, cuando en realidad es una lengua.” (Ngäbere is not a variety of Spanish or of any other known language.  Through ignorance people usually call Ngäbere “dialect,” when in reality it is a language.) &lt;ref&gt;Personal communication, December 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dialecto'' is a word used popularly to refer to languages that are considered inferior. As Spanish is the official language of 21 countries, spoken by more than 500 million people and has an institution that sets the rules of the correct grammar (Real Academia Española), it is considered a real language. On the other hand, Ngäbere is not official in any country, spoken by few people relatively (less than a half million for example) and has no standard grammar, then it is not considered a real language (when linguistically it really is).

As a traditionally oral language, the Ngäbere writing system has only very recently been created. An alphabet was developed using the Latin script, based on the Spanish alphabet.  Given that Spanish is the most widely used language in the Central American region, the alphabet was based on the Spanish alphabet in the attempt to create a closer sense of correlation between the two languages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lininger Ross, B. (1981). Estudios Sobre el Guaymí Ngäbere: Fonologia, Alfabeto Y Diccionario Provisional. Revista De Filología y Lingüística De La Universidad De Costa Rica, 7)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some features of the alphabet are as follows:
*In the case of nasalized vowels and diphthongs, an {{angle bracket|n}} is collocated after the nucleus.  For example, /kï/{{clarify|date=January 2013}} is written {{angle bracket|kün}}.
*In the case of the phonetic sound {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[ɡ]}}, and {{IPA|[kʷ]}} and {{IPA|[ɡʷ]}} appearing in the middle of a word, the symbols used are {{angle bracket|k}} and {{angle bracket|kw}} although it is pronounced as {{IPA|[ɡ]}} and {{IPA|[ɡʷ]}}.  In a similar manner, when a {{angle bracket|t}} appears in the middle of a word, it is pronounced as {{IPA|[d]}}.   Therefore, a word such as {{angle bracket|kwete}} is pronounced {{IPA|[kwede]}}, and {{angle bracket|mike}} is pronounced {{IPA|[miɡe]}}.
*In the case of labialized consonants, the grapheme {{angle bracket|w}} has been collocated after the consonants where the labialization occurs.
*The allophones of the consonants {{IPA|/b d ɡ r/}} are {{IPA|/β ð ɣ ɾ/}}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*The Spanish graphemes are used for {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}} {{angle bracket|ch}}, {{IPA|[ĵ]}}{{clarify|date=January 2013}} {{angle bracket|y}}, {{IPA|[h]}} {{angle bracket|j}}.  The Spanish {{angle bracket|ñ}} is also used for the corresponding phoneme {{IPA|ɲ}}.
*In accordance with the system designed by Arosemena and Javilla,&lt;ref&gt;Arosemena, B., Melquíades, A.,. (1980). Observaciones analíticas de un texto narrativo guaimí (Analytical Observations of a Narrative Guaymí Text)  Estudios Sobre El Discurso En Guaymí, 35-59; Arosemena, F. C.,  (1980). Los participantes en un texto narrativo guaimí (The participants in a Guaymí narrative text). Estudios Sobre El Discurso En Guaymí, , 61-82.&lt;/ref&gt; the phonemes /ï/, /ë/ {{clarify|date=March 2017}} and /ʚ/ are represented with the graphemes {{angle bracket|ü}}, {{angle bracket|ö}}, and {{angle bracket|ä}} respectively.
*The velar consonant phoneme {{IPA|ŋ}} is represented by the grapheme {{angle bracket|ng}} &lt;ref&gt;Lininger Ross, B. (1982). II-El Alfabeto Practico Ngäbere y las Listas Ilustrativas (II – The Practical Ngäbere Alphabet and Illustrative Lists). Revista De Filología y Lingüística De La Universidad De Costa Rica, 8(1-2), 137-154.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some letters in the Spanish alphabet are not present in the Ngäbere alphabet, such as {{angle bracket|c}} and {{angle bracket|q}}, {{angle bracket|p}}, {{angle bracket|v}}, {{angle bracket|x}}, and {{angle bracket|z}}, whose Spanish values either do not exist in Ngäbere or are represented by other letters. Loan words containing the phone {{IPA|[p]}}, which does not exist in Ngäbere, are modified to /b/, such as /ban/ for “pan” (bread), and /bobre/ for “pobre” (poor) &lt;ref&gt;Lininger Ross, B. (1981). Estudios Sobre el Guaymí Ngäbere: Fonologia, Alfabeto Y Diccionario Provisional. Revista De Filología y Lingüística De La Universidad De Costa Rica, 7)&lt;/ref&gt;

Standardization of spelling has been slow to solidify after the creation of a writing system, especially regarding the transcription of vowels. This appears to have been influenced by the different alphabets and pronunciation of the various Spanish and English speaking researchers attempting to create a representation that corresponds to the spelling system in their language. For example, the word ''Ngäbe'' has been recurrently and erroneously spelled “Ngöbe” by many people, Latino and Ngäbe alike, because the phoneme /ä/ is heard and reproduced by Spanish speakers as /o/, and therefore they attempt to write it that way while continuing to acknowledge that it is in fact a different phoneme than the Spanish /o/.  Along the same lines, ''Ngäbe'' has been spelled “Ngawbe” by numerous English speakers to reconcile English spelling and the pronunciation.  Words that should be written with {{angle bracket|t}} or {{angle bracket|k}} in the middle of the word have also been the subject of non-standard spelling, since many write the word as it is pronounced rather than following the spelling rule. For the purposes of this article, all spelling will attempt to follow the standard writing and phonetics system.

The accent system generally puts the primary accent on the penultimate syllable of words, although there many exceptions. A monosyllabic word always features a primary or strong accent.  In a bisyllabic word the accent can fall on either syllable.  In words of three or four syllables the primary accent often appears in the first or second syllable; in the rare longer word of three or more syllables, sometimes two primary accents may appear. The tone is slightly higher on the primary accent than on the rest of the word.&lt;ref&gt;Lininger Ross, B. (1981). Estudios Sobre el Guaymí Ngäbere: Fonologia, Alfabeto Y Diccionario Provisional. Revista De Filología y Lingüística De La Universidad De Costa Rica, 7)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ngäbere is largely a monotonous language, with few extreme fluctuations in tone. To listen to a recorded sample of the language, visit Global Recordings Network,&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalrecordings.net/en/program/C04260]&lt;/ref&gt; where they have recordings of messages and songs created for the purpose of Evangelical missionary work, as well as the English scripts.

==Grammar==

===Sentence structure===

The word order of the Ngäbere sentence generally follows a Subject – Object – Verb pattern, which is a common feature of Chibchan languages.

:Ti 	aro 	kwete.	   ("I eat rice" or literally, "I rice eat")
	
:''sub	obj	verb''

Young and Givón describe the sentence features in which Ngäbere differs from typical S–O–V languages:

:"Although the language bears the unmistakable marks of an SOV language, auxiliaries and modality verbs precede – rather than follow – their compliments.  This also extends to the negative marker, which precedes the auxiliary verb (or the main verb in the absence of auxiliary).  This feature of Ngäbére word order is at variance with the normal pattern of rigid SOV languages.  Among Chibchan languages, some follow the Ngäbére word order pattern; others display a more conservative SOV pattern, with auxiliaries and modality verbs following their verbal compliments; while others yet display both patterns." (Emphasis in the original)&lt;ref&gt;Young, P. D., &amp; Givón, T. (1990). The puzzle of Ngäbére auxiliaries. Grammatical reconstruction in Chibchan and Misumalpan. Studies in Typology and Diachrony, ed. by Croft, Koenning, and Kemmer. 209-243.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
:“An O – V – S order does occur, and is probably a contrastive-object device akin to English Y-movement.  When this order occurs, however, the subject must be case-marked.".&lt;ref&gt;Young, P. D., &amp; Givón, T. (1990). The puzzle of Ngäbére auxiliaries. Grammatical reconstruction in Chibchan and Misumalpan. Studies in Typology and Diachrony, ed. by Croft, Koenning, and Kemmer. 209-243.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly to Korean, another SOV language, “a ‘topic’ suffix may also partake in marking the contrasted noun phrase.” &lt;ref&gt;Givón, T. (2001). Syntax Vol. II. John Benjamins Publishing Co. Amsterdam, 262-263.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, in the passive voice the word order takes on an S – V – O arrangement, much like in English except that the auxiliary verb is placed after the main verb.&lt;ref&gt;Kopesec, M.F. (1975). Los Elementos Verbales y Sustantivos y la Oración en Guaymí (The Verbal and Noun Elements and the Sentence in Guaymí). Observaciones Preliminares Sobre Los Sistemas Gramaticales De Las Lenguas Chibchas,19-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Ye 	miga	 ta 	sete 	kwe.		("This was put here by him.")

:''sub	verb-pass	aux	adv	pron-agent''	

The auxiliary verbs carry the timed or finite verbal inflections, while the complement verbs carry an untimed or non-finite inflection.&lt;ref&gt;Young, P. D., &amp; Givón, T. (1990). The puzzle of Ngäbére auxiliaries. Grammatical reconstruction in Chibchan and Misumalpan. Studies in Typology and Diachrony, ed. by Croft, Koenning, and Kemmer. 209-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative sentences are most commonly formed in the arrangement of S + Negative + (Auxiliary) + (Object) + Verb.&lt;ref&gt;Kopesec, M.F.(1975). Los Elementos Verbales y Sustantivos y la Oración en Guaymí (The Verbal and Noun Elements and the Sentence in Guaymí). Observaciones Preliminares Sobre Los Sistemas Gramaticales De Las Lenguas Chibchas,19-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Ti 	ñan	reba	näen	mäbe.		("I can’t go with you.")

:''I 	not	can	go	you+with''	

:Tikwe	ñaka	ye	noaema.	("I didn´t do that").

:''I + agent	not	that	did''

The negative marker precedes the finite verb.&lt;ref&gt;Young, P. D., &amp; Givón, T. (1990). The puzzle of Ngäbére auxiliaries. Grammatical reconstruction in Chibchan and Misumalpan. Studies in Typology and Diachrony, ed. by Croft, Koenning, and Kemmer. 209-243.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Ti 	ñan 	rika.   (I'm not going!)

:''1sg	neg	go-exclam''

:Kä 	ñaka	nibi	toen 	tie  (“I can't see.” or literally, “The place is not visible to me.”)

:''Place	neg	can-nf	see-nf	1sg-dat''

Ngäbere is a [[Split ergativity|split-ergative]] language.  It also displays a number of suffixal tense-aspect-modality markers, as well as suffixal case markers and adposistions.&lt;ref&gt;Young, P. D., &amp; Givón, T. (1990). The puzzle of Ngäbére auxiliaries. Grammatical reconstruction in Chibchan and Misumalpan. Studies in Typology and Diachrony, ed. by Croft, Koenning, and Kemmer. 209-243.&lt;/ref&gt;  These suffixes are attached to nouns and verbs. When used in the perfect aspect to indicate a nominative case, the suffix ''-kwe'' is used to show agency for transitive subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, T. E. (1988). La Noción de Sujeto en Guaymí (The Notion of Subject in Guaymí). Revista Latinoamericana de Estudios Etnolingüísticos, 5, 169-206.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the imperfect aspect, ''-kwe'' also is used to indicate possession (see ''noun clauses'').

The marker ''-e'' shows dative joining with verbs that show mental state (and may also be used to show possession):

:Ñakare	 	gare 			tie.  (“I don’t understand.”)

:''Neg.		verb-understand	pron+dat''

:Ñantörö	mäe.   (“Hello to you.”)

:''Greeting	pron+dat''

Each Ngäbere suffix has a variety of meanings. Some of the most frequently used suffixes and their English equivalents are as follows. The suffix ''–be'' expresses “with,” “only,” or an immediate reaction.  The suffix ''–btä'' expresses “over,” “to be in,” “going to,” “and,” “also,” and time. The suffix ''–bti'' expresses “over,” above,” “on top of,” “by,” “in,” “through,” “then,” “after,” “plus” (indicates addition or sum), “with” (indicates instrument),  and “behind”&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, R., Gulick, B., and Flynn, J. (2004). Ngabere Manual.  Peace Corps, Panama (unpublished).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noun phrases===

Nouns may be formed by combining two nouns or a noun with a verb:

:''Kräkä'' (medicine) + ''dianka'' (gatherer) = ''kräka dianka'' “medicine man”

Nouns may also be derived by placing a suffix at the end of another word:&lt;ref&gt;Murillo Miranda, J. M. (2009). The nominal phrase ngäbére. Forma y Función, 22(2), 43-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''gore'' (to rob) + ''-gä'' =  ''gogä'' (robber)

:''Ngäbe'' (person) + ''-re'' =  ''Ngäbere'' (Ngäbe language)

Ngäbere contains many polysemic words, meaning that the same word often has many different meanings.  For example, the word ''kä'' denotes name, earth, year, climate, and place, depending on context. Other examples are ''sö'' (moon, month, tobacco), ''kukwe'' (language, word, topic, issue, roast, burn), ''kri'' (tree, large), ''tö'' (mind, intelligence, to want, summer), and ''tare'' (pain, difficulty, love)&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, R., Gulick, B., and Flynn, J. (2004). Ngäbere Manual. Peace Corps, Panama (unpublished).&lt;/ref&gt;

The regular noun phrase consists of the nucleus (head noun or pronoun) followed by the possible addition of a modifier, quantifier, or demonstrative.  Articles are not used in Ngäbere.&lt;ref&gt;Kopesec, M.F. (1975). Los Elementos Verbales y Sustantivos y la Oración en Guaymí (The Verbal and Noun Elements and the Sentence in Guaymí). Observaciones Preliminares Sobre Los Sistemas Gramaticales De Las Lenguas Chibchas,19-82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, R., Gulick, B., and Flynn, J. (2004). Ngäbere Manual. Peace Corps, Panama (unpublished).&lt;/ref&gt;

:Monso 	chi 	iti		(A small child)

:''child	 small 	one''

:Mrö 	ñakare			(No food)

:''Food	none''	

:Ñö	mrene	krubäte		(Very salty water)

:''Water	salty	very''

:Mütü	kri	ye		(That large pig)

:''Pig 	large	that''

''''Plurality''''

All nouns are countable in Ngäbere.  To form a plural noun in reference to humans, ''-tre'' is added:

:''meri'' (woman) = ''meritre'' (women)

In reference to non-human entities, such as animals and other objects, ''-krä'' is added:&lt;ref&gt;Murillo Miranda, J. M. (2009). The nominal phrase ngäbére. Forma y Función, 22(2), 43-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Kwi'' (chicken) = ''kwikrä'' (chickens).

''''Personal pronouns''''

''Ti''	     	I

''Mä''	     	you

''Niara''     	he, she

''Nun''	     	we

''Mun''	     	you (plural)

''Niaratre''     	they

''''Reflexive pronouns''''

Reflexivity and reciprocity is marked with ''ja''.  ''Ja tikekä'' means “to cut onself.” ''Mete'' means “to hit,” but when ''ja'' is added, ''ja mete'' means “to fight.” ''Ja'' may also indicate possession, as in the case of ''ja gwriete'', “one’s own house.”&lt;ref&gt;Murillo Miranda, J. M. (2009). The nominal phrase ngäbére. Forma y Función, 22(2), 43-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

''''Demonstrative pronouns''''

''Ne''	     	This (object is close to the speaker)

''Ye''	     	That (object is far from the speaker but close to the listener)

''Se''	     	That (object is far from both speaker and listener)

The demonstrative pronouns are modified by the suffix of location ''–te'' and ''–kware'' to create adverbs and prepositions of location:&lt;ref&gt;Murillo Miranda, J. M. (2009). The nominal phrase ngäbére. Forma y Función, 22(2), 43-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nete''     		Here

''Yete''     		There

''Sete''     	Way over there

''Negware''     	Toward here

''Segware''     	Toward there

''''Possessive''''

There are no possessive pronouns.  Possession is marked depending on the order of possessor and possessed. The suffix ''–kwe''  is added to nouns or pronouns to show non-inherent possession (such as possession of objects, animals, political relations, etc.) in order of possessed/possessor.

''Tikwe''     		my, mine
				
''Mäkwe''	     	yours	
				
''Niarakwe''     		his, her, hers	
			
''Nunkwe''     		our, ours
				
''Munkwe''     		your, yours (plural)

''Niaratrekwe''     		theirs

''Minchi Mariakwe''     	Maria´s cat

''Mrö monsokwe''     	the child´s food

''Meye mäkwe''     		your mother

''Nukro tikwe''     		my dog

Non-inherent possession can also be shown in the possessor/possessed by adding the suffix ''-e''.

''Ti jue''     			my house

Possession is also shown by placing a personal pronoun or noun in front of an inherently possessed object (family members, body parts, etc.).

''Ti run''	    		my father

''Mä eteba''	     	your brother

''Samuel okwä''	     	Samuel’s eye

Double possession uses both structures:&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, R., Gulick, B., and Flynn, J. (2004). Ngäbere Manual. Peace Corps, Panama (unpublished).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murillo Miranda, J. M. (2009). The nominal phrase ngäbére. Forma y Función, 22(2), 43-69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kopesec, M.F. (1975). Los Elementos Verbales y Sustantivos y la Oración en Guaymí (The Verbal and Noun Elements and the Sentence in Guaymí). Observaciones Preliminares Sobre Los Sistemas Gramaticales De Las Lenguas Chibchas,19-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kä mundiaka etebakwe''     	the hunter´s brother´s land

''Ju ti rünkwe''     			my father´s house

===Verbs===

Ngäbere verbs do not need to agree with their subject — verbs are inflected only for tense, not person. “Ngäbere verbs do not display subject or object agreement. In this way they differ from verbs in related Chibchan languages”.&lt;ref&gt;Young, P. D., &amp; Givón, T. (1990). The puzzle of Ngäbére auxiliaries. Grammatical reconstruction in Chibchan and Misumalpan. Studies in Typology and Diachrony, ed. by Croft, Koenning, and Kemmer. 209-243.&lt;/ref&gt; While the verbs are conjugated solely in respect to time, linguistic treatment of time is somewhat more complex in Ngäbere than in English. According to Kopesec,&lt;ref&gt;Kopesec, M.F. (1975). Los Elementos Verbales y Sustantivos y la Oración en Guaymí (The Verbal and Noun Elements and the Sentence in Guaymí). Observaciones Preliminares Sobre Los Sistemas Gramaticales De Las Lenguas Chibchas,19-82.&lt;/ref&gt; there are two broad categories of time, actual and potential.  Actual refers to an action that has happened or has begun to happen, while potential refers to an action that is projected or intended.  
Furthermore, there are two other categories that verbs may be placed in, limited or unlimited. A limited verb is not currently in progress, which implies an end point or completion in the case of actual verbs, or a future beginning point in the case of potential verbs.  An unlimited verb is currently in progress during a specific scenario, and the beginning or end point is not implied. 
 
One more distinction made by the Ngäbere concept of time is linguistically differentiating between the near past and the remote past, as well as the near future and the remote future.&lt;ref&gt;Kopesec, M.F. (1975). Los Elementos Verbales y Sustantivos y la Oración en Guaymí (The Verbal and Noun Elements and the Sentence in Guaymí). Observaciones Preliminares Sobre Los Sistemas Gramaticales De Las Lenguas Chibchas,19-82.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking the close or recent past may be considered during the same day as the present time.  Farther back in the past should be expressed using the remote past.  Verbs are conjugated by taking the root of the verb and adding a suffix.  The suffixes for recent and remote past change depending on the root class, but the future suffixes remain the same for all root classes.

For example, the verb ''mike'' (to put) can be conjugated in the following ways by taking the root ''mika'' and adding suffixes. It may be translated into English by adding an adverbial phrase to express the implied actual or potential time.

''Limited''

Niarakwe jodron ye miri sete.     ''"He put it there (not long ago)."''  	Action recently completed

Niarakwe jodron ye mikaba sete.	''"He put it there (a long time ago)."''	Action completed long ago

Niarakwe jodron ye mikadi sete.	''"He will put it there (soon)."''		Action to take place shortly.

Niarakwe jodron ye mikai sete.	''"He will put it there (much later)."''	Action to take place in remote future

''Unlimited''

Niarakwe jodron ye mike sete.	''"He puts it there (right now)."''	Present action

OR	''"He is putting it there (right now)."''	Present continuous action

Jodron ye mika ta sete kwe.	''"It was put there by him."''		Passive voice

Niarakwe jodron ye mikadre sete.	''"He has to put it there (now)."''	Present obligation

Auxiliary verbs are used to describe movement, state, and change of state.  For example:

Ti nikira jüben.	''I am going (right now) to bathe.''	

Ti bi niken.		''I am going.''

Niara reba blite kuin.	''She can speak well.''		

Ti niki ngin den.	''I am going to get firewood.''

==Demographics==

The total population of those who identified themselves as Ngäbe in the 2010 Panamanian National Census&lt;ref&gt;Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censo (National Institute of Statistics and Census), Republic of Panama (2010). Indigenous Population in the Republic, by Sex, Indigenous Group, and Age Groups, 2010. http://www.contraloria.gob.pa/inec/&lt;/ref&gt; was 260,058. The population of speakers in Costa Rica in the year 2000 was 5,090, with a total ethnic population of 5,360.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M. P. (ed.), 2009. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. Online version: http://www.ethnologue.com/.&lt;/ref&gt;  It must be kept in mind that the number of speakers of Ngäbere is somewhat lower than the ethnic population, given the fact that many younger people today are not learning the language.  Oftentimes people of indigenous descent who do not speak the indigenous language do not consider themselves to be “Indians” but rather identify themselves as Latino or campesino.  Before the formation of the Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé, census figures for Ngäbe population were based on whether or not they spoke the native language.&lt;ref&gt;Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censo (National Institute of Statistics and Census), Republic of Panama (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Ngäbe people and language have been historically referred to by Latinos as ''Guaymí'', although in recent years the use of ''Ngäbe'' and ''Ngäbere'' has become prevalent.  It is not clear where the name ''Guaymí'' originated, although there has been speculation.  One such theory is that the term was derived from the Buglere word ''ngwamigda'', which means “indigenous.” &lt;ref&gt;Bletzer, K. V. (1987). Word borrowing and word play among Ngawbere (Panama). East Lansing: Michigan State University.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rolando Rodríguez offers another theory of the origin of the words ''Guaymí'' and ''Bogotá'' in reference to the Ngäbe and Buglé peoples, respectively, that the terms come from both the Ngäbere and Buglere languages:

:La historia de los grupos indígenas revela una continua rivalidad manifestada de diferentes formas, pero unas de las formas reveladoras de rivalidad es la forma verbal, es decir, una guerra verbal que se caracteriza por el sarcasmo, la ironía, y la ofensa utilizando palabras, una vez superando las tensiones de la luchas los ngäbe y buglé. En algún momento de la historia hicieron alianza como estrategia de defensa ante otro grupo de indígenas pero en esta convivencia cada uno decía ser mejor que el otro.  Los ngäbes llamaron  a los buglé bobotas o bokotas para ofenderlos, para decir que eran como unos sapos, y los buglé utilizaron la palabra gwarare, o gwa minta, que significa como lombrices.  Los contactos latinos con los grupos indígenas ratificaron que se les llamaba bokotas o guaymíes y así se escribieron los libros. Pero ahora ninguna de esas palabras designa a ninguno de los dos grupos.
:(The history of the indigenous groups reveals a continual rivalry manifested in different forms, but one of the revealing forms of rivalry is the verbal form-- that is to say, a verbal war which is characterized by sarcasm, irony, and offense using words, at one point overcoming the tensions in the struggles of the Ngäbe and Buglé.  At some moment in history they made an alliance as a defense strategy against another indigenous group, but in this fellowship each one said that they were better than the other.  The Ngäbes called the Buglés ''bobotas'' or ''bokotas'' to offend them, to say that they were like toads, and the Buglés used the word ''gwarare'', or ''gwa minta'', which means worms.  The contacts made by Latinos with the indigenous groups confirmed that the other group was called ''Bokotas'' or ''Guaymíes'', and so the books were written. But now neither of these words designates either of the two groups.)&lt;ref&gt;R. Rodríguez, personal communication, December 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural language use==

Vagueness and long silences are normal and acceptable in communication.  In fact, it is considered impolite if one does not give another enough time to consider his words before speaking.

It is typical to greet one another or pass the time while working by making a noise known in Spanish as a saloma or grito.

Word play is common, where double and even triple meanings may be implied.&lt;ref&gt;Bletzer, K. V. (1987). Word borrowing and word play among Ngawbere (Panama). East Lansing: Michigan State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names and kinship terms==

Ngäbe proper names typically don't refer to any object, natural or otherwise—for the most part they are just names. Some examples of male names are Oli, Chíton, Chä, Niti, Ima, Nicho, Ulira, and Itikän.  Examples of female names are Besikó, Ei, Bei, Bechi, Belikó, Meti, Mesi, and Tu&lt;ref&gt;Murillo Miranda, J. M. (2009). The nominal phrase ngäbére. Forma y Función, 22(2), 43-69.&lt;/ref&gt;  Last names are determined by where a person is from.  Traditionally the Ngäbes lived in small hamlets as family units, and the name of this place was their family name.  Stemming from the influence of Christian missionaries grouping the people into tighter communities, today it is more common to live in larger communities, though the last name is still determined by the name of the town. 
  
Most Ngäbes have two names, their Ngäbe name and their Spanish name.  The Spanish name is their legal name and is used for all official documentation and during much of everyday life.  In recent times, the use of Ngäbe names is often pushed aside, especially in front of outsiders. On the other hand, Ngäbes love to bestow Ngäbe names on trusted outsiders to share their culture and indicate acceptance, and will refer to that person exclusively by his or her Ngäbe name. 
 
Ngäbe communities also have two names, one in Spanish and one in Ngäbere, which often correspond with each other, but not always. For example, "Cerro Otoe" (Otoe Mountain) and "Tätobta" (Beside Otoe Peak), "Llano Ñopo" (Spaniard Plain) and "Suliakwatabti" (On top of Spaniard Plain/Flesh). Many other communities have place names that are either untranslatable proper nouns or names whose translations have been lost. Examples include "Kinkinbta" ("Peña Blanca" or "White Cliff" in Spanish), Kaninbta ("Hato Pilón" or "Rice Mortar Ranch"), and Ünbti ("Hato Chamí" or "Chamí Ranch").

Kinship terms are quite broad and often can be applied to many types of relationships, depending on where the person falls in the kinship network.  P.D. Young &lt;ref&gt;Young, P. D. (1971). Ngawbe: Tradition and Change Among the Western Guaymí of Panama. Urbana: University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote an ethnography in the 1960s which offers, among other things, an in-depth analysis of the complexity of kinship relations.  Kinship terms often depend on the sex of the speaker.  For example, the words for “brother” and “sister” are determined by the sex of both siblings. ''Eteba'' is a sibling of the same sex, and ''ngwae'' is a sibling of the opposite sex.  Therefore, if the speaker is male, his brother would be ''eteba'' and his sister ''ngwae''; if the speaker is female, her brother would be ''ngwae'' and her sister ''eteba''.  However, both these terms could also be applied to what in English would be known as “cousin” or “second cousin.”  There are also vocative and non-vocative kinship terms, depending on whether one is speaking directly to the relative or simply referring to them.  Traditionally a man was not supposed to speak directly to his ''u'', or father-in-law, and ''me'', mother-in-law, although he was bound in service to them in return for marrying their daughter.  Therefore, in this case there are no vocative terms because the ''duana'', “son-in-law,” was not supposed to directly address them.

==Useful phrases==

The following list of phrases&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, R., Gulick, B., and Flynn, J. (2004). Ngäbere Manual. Peace Corps, Panama (unpublished)&lt;/ref&gt; is likely to be useful for a visitor to the Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé.  Oftentimes locals will greet foreigners in Ngäbere to test them.  They are very impressed and culturally validated by simple exchanges with foreigners in Ngäbere. 
 
''Ñantörö''				Hello

''Köbö kuin dekä (dere, deu)''	Good morning (afternoon, evening)

''Dre kukwe (“dre gwe”)''		What’s up?

''Basakukwe.''			Visiting.

''Mä kä ño?''			What is your name?

''Ti kä …''			My name is …

''Mä niki medente?''		Where are you going?

''Ti niki sete.''			I´m going over there.

''Ti ta basare.''		I am visiting.

''Mä medente?''			Where are you from?

''Ti Estados Unidosbu.'' 		I am from the United States.

''Jän''				Yes

''Ñakare''				No

''Mä tua ño?''			How are you?

''Ti ta kuin''			I am fine.

''Ja tuaita''			See you.

==Cultural customs==

*''''Juride''''	To harvest someone else’s land because you helped to plant it (or with the expectation that you will allow them to harvest from your land in return)
*''''Dö''''	An alcoholic beverage usually of corn (in Spanish, ''chicha fuerte'')
*''''Kra''''	Chácara, a traditional bag woven from natural fibers or sewn with purchased threads.
*''''Krün''''	''Balsería'', a seasonal gathering of several communities that traditionally involves a game where men throw large balsawood sticks at the legs of opponents. In past times food was prepared for the invited guest community, marriage arrangements were made, stories were told, and grievances were aired by fist fights.  In current times it is mainly an opportunity to drink exorbitant amounts of chicha, fight, and throw the balsa.
*''''Mägän''''	Puberty ritual for girls (no longer practiced frequently).  Upon having her first menstruation, a girl was taken into isolation and ritually bathed. She was taught how to be a woman by an old woman in the community, who instructed her how to behave for her husband and how to make chácaras.
*''''Grä''''	Puberty ritual for boys, in which they were taken out into the wilderness by an elder who taught them how to be men and how to make hats.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, R., Gulick, B., and Flynn, J. (2004). Ngäbere Manual. Peace Corps, Panama (unpublished)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The influence of Spanish on Ngäbere==

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the language of education and government, and is the ''lingua franca'' for contact with outsiders.  Ngäbere has borrowed many words from Spanish, and to a lesser extent from English.  The sounds of the loan words are often nasalized, voiced, or de-voiced, in order to conform to Ngäbere phonology.  K. Bletzer Bletzer&lt;ref&gt;K. V. (1987). Word borrowing and word play among Ngawbere (Panama). East Lansing: Michigan State University.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that

:"the phoneticized words can expect to have meaning within the Ngawbere language (semanticization) that extends beyond or embellishes the original meaning in the foreign language.  This particularly is true when the introduced objects (or concepts) are associated with similar objects (or concepts) or strategic importance to Ngawbere culture, that is, the borrowed word will carry a high semantic load in terms of the more salient values of Ngawbere culture."

Since most Ngäbere words end in vowel sounds, foreign words ending in consonants are often stripped of their final consonants or adorned with a final vowel.  Internal consonants are also softened. (ex. Jesus → ''Jesu'', ''arroz'' “rice” → ''aro'', ''carro'' “car” → ''caro'', ''cruz'' “cross” → ''kruso'').  Many of the loan words are household objects or technologies that were brought in by outsiders (ex. ''celular'' “cell phone,” ''mesa'' “table”).  In addition to using loan words, bilingual Ngäbes conversing with each other often code switch between Spanish and Ngäbere within the same conversation or even the same sentence.

The Ngäbere alphabet was designed taking into consideration the differences between Spanish and Ngäbere, and the need to reconcile these differences.  Costa Rican linguist Barbara Lininger notes a tension between the two languages with “la presencia del español como lengua de cultura predominante, o al menos coexistente en la región.  Dicho factor causa un conflicto debido a las grandes diferencias que existen entre los dos idiomas” (the presence of Spanish as the language of predominant culture, or at least coexistent in the region. Said factor causes a conflict due to the great differences that exist between the two languages)&lt;ref&gt;Lininger Ross, B.(1982). II-El Alfabeto Practico Ngäbere y las Listas Ilustrativas (II – The Practical Ngäbere Alphabet and Illustrative Lists). Revista De Filología y Lingüística De La Universidad De Costa Rica, 8(1-2), 137-154.&lt;/ref&gt;
   
The Ngäbe people´s feelings about the Latinos can be seen in how they initially called their invaders: ''Sulia'', which is a kind of small cockroach.  The Spanish language is therefore called ''Suliare'', which means to speak like a cockroach.  By the same token, Ngäbes have long been the recipient of sustained racism from the Latinos.  The language use and education of Ngäbere in the home has been heavily diminished by cause of several factors, including the socialization to be embarrassed of Ngäbe language and culture because of racism and low self-esteem. The use of the word ''dialecto'', which often used to label the language, is considered demeaning:

:La palabra dialecto se suele utilizar con sentido discriminatorio u ofensivo  para disminuir el valor de la cultura o de los hablantes. Esto producía un efecto negativo en la autoestima de los Ngäbes por mucho tiempo, cuyo impacto se podía ver cuando un Ngäbe prefería abstenerse de hablar frente a persona de otro grupo cultural por pena. Pero ahora se observa un proceso de recuperación de la autoestima, y la gente tiene más confianza en sí misma y en el valor de su cultura, y por ende en el idioma.
(The word “dialect” usually is used with a discriminatory or offensive meaning to diminish the value of the culture or of the speakers.  This produced a negative effect in the self-esteem of the Ngäbes for a long time, whose impact could be seen when a Ngäbe preferred to abstain from speaking in front of a person of another cultural group because of embarrassment.  But now a process of recuperation of self-esteem is observed, and the people have more confidence in themselves and in the value of their culture, and ultimately in the language.)&lt;ref&gt;R. Rodríguez, personal communication, December 9, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Language loss has also occurred because of the very education that has helped a select few Ngäbes move ahead in a Spanish-speaking world.  Rodriguez points out:

:Hay un fenómeno que quisiera resaltar y es el hecho de que al iniciarse la década de los 80 los estudiantes Ngäbes que tuvieron la oportunidad de estudiar en las escuelas, colegios y universidades han estado en menos contacto con la práctica de las costumbres, tradiciones orales y  el idioma hablado y no tienen tanta habilidad para recordar y practicar las costumbres y el idioma. Los niños de las generaciones nuevas no tienen habilidad para hablar en Ngäbere.
:(There is a phenomenon that I would like to highlight, and it is the fact that at the beginning of the 80’s, the Ngäbe students that had the chance to study in the elementary schools, high schools, and universities have been in less contact with the practice of the customs, oral traditions, and the spoken language, and don’t have as much ability to remember and practice the customs and language.  The children of the new generations don’t have the ability to speak in Ngäbere.)&lt;ref&gt;R. Rodríguez, personal communication, December 9, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Often parents want their children to speak Spanish in order to have more success in life.  Even when Ngäbere is still spoken in the home it is not uncommon for children to answer their parents’ Ngäbere questions in Spanish.  Spanish is spoken almost exclusively at school, and even on the playground.  The result is that many in the younger generations are not learning the language, and those who have not learned it can’t pass it on to their children.  Although the language is not in immediate danger of extinction, there is a chance that in the future if this trend continues it could be in danger.

Due to growing concern about the future of the language and culture, there has been a recent resurgence in cultural pride, even  a reclamation of sorts of a position of power: “En término general los Ngäbes se sienten orgullosos de su cultura y de su idioma. [Ahora] se sienten más cómodos  de hablar y practicar los elementos de las costumbres y tradiciones, como los bailes, y decir sus nombres en Ngäbere sin pena.” (In general terms the Ngäbes feel proud of their culture and language.  They [now] feel more comfortable speaking and practicing the elements of their customs and traditions, such as the dances, and say their names in Ngäbere without shame.”&lt;ref&gt;R. Rodríguez, personal communication, December 9, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

Until recent decades, it was nearly unheard of for a Ngäbe to receive an education past primary school.  Although there are definitely more educational opportunities now than in the past, there is still much wanting in the education of Ngäbe children. According to the Minority Rights Group International, only 18% of children ages 15–19 in the Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé receive schooling beyond sixth grade, compared to the national average of 65%.&lt;ref&gt;Minority Rights Group International. Guaymí (Ngobe-Buglé). Updated December 2008. http://www.minorityrights.org/4209/panama/Guaymí-ngobeBuglé.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Although education through ninth grade is free and compulsory, it is difficult for many Ngäbe children to attend school.  Many live in remote areas too far away to attend school, and some walk up to three hours and back every day to attend classes.  Many families do not have enough money to buy uniforms or notebooks for their children. Although the government offers welfare programs such as ''La Red de Oportunidades'' (Network of Opportunities) which gives women with children $50 a month that is supposed to help out with education expenses, oftentimes those resources are spent before they are even received. Even if children are able to attend school they usually receive a subpar education, since the least experienced(and sometimes most disgruntled) teachers often get sent to work in difficult access schools.  If a small percentage of Ngäbes graduate from high school, a minuscule amount (less than 1%) is able to receive a higher education.

Due to these factors, the majority of those who are technically literate are still very poorly educated, and are often looked down upon by other Panamanians in part because of their poor Spanish skills and lack of education.  The elderly and women are more likely to be illiterate, and many old women do not even speak Spanish at all.  As such, these people are less likely to know how and through which channels to petition aid from the government or become self-sufficient workers within the Panamanian economy. Even more seriously, “Due to inadequate education and poor Spanish language skills members of this group are often unaware of their rights and fail to employ legal channels when threatened” by outside coercions from mining and power companies, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;Minority Rights Group International. Guaymí (Ngobe-Buglé). Updated December 2008. 
http://www.minorityrights.org/4209/panama/Guaymí-ngobeBuglé.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Panamanian National Institute of Statistics and Census,&lt;ref&gt;Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censo (National Institute of Statistics and Census), Republic of Panama (2010). http://www.contraloria.gob.pa/inec/&lt;/ref&gt; the percentage of illiteracy in the Comarca Ngäbe Buglé fell from 45.9% in 2000 to 30.8% in 2010; although a significant improvement, it is still much a much higher rate than in the rest of Panama, with women having a higher illiteracy rate than men. These numbers refer only to Spanish literacy. Most Ngäbes are illiterate in Ngäbere, since it is traditionally an oral language.  Learning to read Ngäbere is not a priority to most Ngäbes, since there is a more urgent need for literacy in Spanish.  As well, there is still the ever-present cultural stigma attached to the language that may be affecting the impetus of Ngäbere as a written language.  Rodríguez&lt;ref&gt;R. Rodríguez, personal communication, December 9, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;) observes that “la gente en general está enfocando su interés otra vez en el idioma pero no tiene habilidad para leer su propio idioma y al hacerlo les da pena.” (The people in general are again focusing their interest in the language, but they don’t have the ability to read their own language and they are embarrassed doing it).

Comarca law stipulates that there must be a bilingual Spanish/Ngäbere education.  However, in practice there has been virtually no application of this policy.  There are a few prototype bilingual programs in existence in primary schools.  There was also a new university established in 2010, La Universidad de las Américas (UDELAS), located in Chichica, which is dedicated to providing a degree in intercultural bilingual education.  In 2012 UDELAS will have its first graduating class, and it is hoped that, according to Professor Julia Mora, it will produce a notable change in the Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé by training teachers who will rescue the Ngäbere language. There is another Comarca institution located in Soloy, La Universidad Ngäbe-Buglé, which is “preparando personal bilingüe de la comarca para la comarca” (preparing bilingual personnel from the Comarca for the Comarca).&lt;ref&gt;R. Rodríguez, personal communication, December 9, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  It is hoped that more Ngäbes will be trained as teachers who will show greater dedication to the preservation of Ngäbe culture and language by working within the Comarca.

==Research problems==

Research of Ngäbere has been sporadic throughout the past 200 years.  Among the first efforts to study the language was a basic lexicon written in the beginning of the 19th century by Padre Blas José Franco.  His work was the base of a lexicon written by A. L. Pinart, who visited the Cricamola River region in 1893.  His findings were then used as the base of some language studies by other linguists but very little of the information was thoroughly reliable or extensive.&lt;ref&gt;Alphonse, E. S. (1956). Guaymí; Grammar and Dictionary: With some ethnological notes. Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin 162.  U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ephraim S. Alphonse was a Methodist missionary who lived among the Ngäbe for 21 years and became fluent in their language. In 1956 his ''Guaymí Grammar and Dictionary'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;Alphonse, E. S. (1956). Guaymí; Grammar and Dictionary: With some ethnological notes. Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin 162.  U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; While far more substantial than anything previously published, it still had problems. José Murillo notes that, “Aunque los ejemplos de este autor son numerosos, carecen, en general, de transmorfologización, lo cual hace al trabajo poco útil.” (Although the examples of this author are numerous, they lack, in general, in transmorphologization, which makes them of little use to work with”&lt;ref&gt;Murillo Miranda, J. M. (2009). The nominal phrase ngäbére. Forma y Función, 22(2), 43-69.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alphonse was not a trained linguist, so while his effort was well-intentioned and his long history with the people was insightful, it remained for the next generation of linguists to offer a more detailed and correct description of Ngäbere grammar.

During the 1970s and 80s more attention was focused on studying the phonetic and grammatical structures, during which time a definite alphabet and writing system was developed. Kopesec offers a more comprehensive description of the grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Kopesec, M.F. (1974). La Jerarquía Fonológica Del Guaymí (The Phonologic Hierarchy of Guaymí).  Sistemas Fonológicos, 17-30;(1975). Los Elementos Verbales y Sustantivos y la Oración en Guaymí (The Verbal and Noun Elements and the Sentence in Guaymí). Observaciones Preliminares Sobre Los Sistemas Gramaticales De Las Lenguas Chibchas,19-82.&lt;/ref&gt;  Payne also gave insights on the function of the subject in Ngäbere.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, T. E. (1988). La Noción de Sujeto en Guaymí (The Notion of Subject in Guaymí). Revista Latinoamericana de Estudios Etnolingüísticos, 5, 169-206.&lt;/ref&gt;  Murillo has recently expanded on the works of Kopesec and Payne in regards to the grammar and formation of words and sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Murillo Miranda, J. M. (2009). The nominal phrase ngäbére. Forma y Función, 22(2), 43-69.&lt;/ref&gt;)
Lininger comments on the difficulties regarding the research itself due to the linguistic pre-perceptions of the researchers:

:“Al trabajar con una lengua desconocida ha habido problemas para los investigadores por falta de pares mínimos y/o marcos adecuados. Al trabajar diferentes personas en análisis previos ha habido diferencias de punto de vista en cuanto a la interpretación de datos.  Posiblemente por la naturaleza de sus diversos idiomas (inglés y español), al trabajar hablantes nativos de distintos idiomas ha habido diferencias de percepción que resultaron en sobrediferenciación de fonemas de parte de los investigadores”
:(When working with an unknown language there have been problems for the investigators because of the lack of minimal pairs and/or adequate framework.  Different people when working in previous analyses have had different points of view regarding the interpretation of data. Possibly due to the nature of their diverse languages (English and Spanish), native speakers of different languages have had differences of perception that resulted in overdifferentiation of phonemes on the part of the investigators.)&lt;ref&gt;Lininger Ross, B. (1981). Estudios Sobre el Guaymí Ngäbere: Fonologia, Alfabeto Y Diccionario Provisional. Revista De Filología y Lingüística De La Universidad De Costa Rica, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish speakers find the Ngäbere nasalized vowels quite difficult to distinguish and reproduce due to the nature of Spanish vowels. It has also been observed by English speakers that “/b/, /m/, /n/, and /l/ are notoriously difficult to distinguish in Guaymí speech” (Young 1990). Oftentimes spelling has been inconsistent within the body of published research.

Studies in the past have sometimes been conducted in a manner which could lead to inconclusive results for the language as a whole (i.e. using only one informant as the language source in the study), as in the studies of Lininger&lt;ref&gt;Lininger Ross, B. (1981). Estudios Sobre el Guaymí Ngäbere: Fonologia, Alfabeto Y Diccionario Provisional. Revista De Filología y Lingüística De La Universidad De Costa Rica, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  and Payne&lt;ref&gt;Payne, T. E. (1988). La Noción de Sujeto en Guaymí (The Notion of Subject in Guaymí). Revista Latinoamericana de Estudios Etnolingüísticos, 5, 169-206.&lt;/ref&gt; in studying the Ngäbere of Costa Rican speakers.

As has been the case over the past 200 years, there is a scarcity of current published research, especially on cultural language use.  There are some published colloquial works, educational manuals, and religious translations, although few in number. These include stories from the oral tradition; a translation of the New Testament, ''Kukwe Kuin Ngöbökwe''&lt;ref&gt;Kukwe Kuin Ngöbökwe: El Nuevo Testamento en Ngäbere de Panamá (The Good Word of God: The New Testament in Ngäbere of Panama) (2004).  Wycliffe Bible Translators.&lt;/ref&gt; and a hymnal, ''Ari Kare Ngöböye.''&lt;ref&gt;Teubner, C., Prado, E., Gómez, B., Bivin, W, transl. (2006). Ari Kare Ngöböye, Cuarto Ed. (Let’s Sing to God, 4th ed.). USA: El Centro de Literatura Ngäbere (CELING).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Huseyn Javid''' ({{lang-az|Hüseyn Cavid}}), born '''Huseyn Abdulla oglu Rasizadeh''' (24 October 1882, [[Nakhchivansky Uyezd|Nakhchivan]] – 5 December 1941, Shevchenko, [[Tayshetsky District]]), was a prominent [[Azerbaijan]]i poet and playwright of the early 20th century. He was one of the founders of progressive romanticism movement in the contemporary [[Azerbaijani literature]]. He was exiled during the [[Great Purge|Stalin purges]] in the [[USSR]].

== Life and career ==
Huseyn Abdulla oglu Rasizadeh was born in 1882 to a family of a theologian in [[Nakhchivansky Uyezd|Nakhchivan]] in the [[Erivan Governorate]]. After completing his elementary education at a religious school in 1898, Javid pursued his mid-school education in the Maktab-i Tarbiya of Mashadi Taghi Sidgi. In 1899–1903, Huseyn Javid studied in the Talibiyya [[Madrasah]] in [[Tabriz]]. After obtaining a degree in literature at the [[Istanbul University]] in 1909, Javid worked as a teacher in Nakhchivan, [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] and [[Tiflis]], and starting from 1915 in [[Baku]].
[[File:Huseyn Javid Mausoleum at Nakhchivan.jpg|thumb|[[Mausoleum of Huseyn Javid|Huseyn Javid Mausoleum]], [[Nakhchivan City|Nakhchivan]]]]

Huseyn Javid's first book of lyrical poems titled ''Kechmish gunlar'' ("The Past Days") was published in 1913. However Javid was known more as a playwright. His philosophical and epic tragedies, and family dramas introduce a new line of development in Azerbaijani literature. In his literary tragedy ''Sheikh Sanan'' (1914), Huseyn Javid philosophized about the idea of a universal religion to lift inter-religious barrier between humans. His most famous creation, [[The Devil (play)|''Iblis'' (The Devil)]] written in 1918, exposed all oppressive forces as the supporters of "humans are wolves to each other" philosophy and "the 20th century cultural savages", and summarized them in the character of Satan. In his works, Javid criticized any form of colonialism and oppression.

During the 1920s and 1930s, Huseyn Javid authored a number of historical epics, such as ''Peyghambar'' (''The Prophet'') in 1922, ''Topal Teymur'' (''[[Tamerlane|Timur]]'') in 1925, ''Sayavush'' (''[[Siyâvash]]'') in 1933 and ''Khayyam'' (''[[Omar Khayyám|Khayyám]]'') in 1935.

=== Arrest, exile and death ===
Huseyn Javid wrote during the time of [[Collectivization]] and Stalin purges in the [[Azerbaijan SSR|Soviet Azerbaijan]]. In the worst times of [[totalitarianism]], he refused to serve as propagandist of "revolutionary socialist achievements". Javid was arrested in 1937 on trumped-up charges of being a "founding member of a counter-revolutionary group that was plotting an overthrow of the Soviet power".&lt;ref&gt;[http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/71_folder/71_articles/71_javid.html "Oil Boom Period in Azerbaijan: Husein Javid,"] Azerbaijan International, Vol. 7:1 (Spring 1999), pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

His arrest was a part of the nationwide campaign of purge against intelligentsia. The Soviet government exiled Huseyn Javid to the Far East to the city of [[Magadan]], Siberia in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.az/books?id=h4N_dneMybQC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=huseyn+javid&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d9MOTJXQN6&amp;sig=Utx7Jw5-VVPyZxl-__0-a5Xbs1o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihg9axqO3WAhXoIpoKHeCsB584ChDoAQg_MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=huseyn%20javid&amp;f=false|title=Aesopian Literary Dimensions of Azerbaijani Literature of the Soviet Period, 1920-1990|last=Tyrrell|first=Maliheh S.|date=2000|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739101698|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on 5 December 1941 in the village of Shevchenko ([[Tayshetsky District]]). Huseyn Javid was officially exonerated in 1956. His repatriation came only on Javid's 100th birthday in 1982, when his remains were moved from Shevchenko back to his homeland of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] and reburied in a mausoleum built in Javid's honor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/44_folder/44_articles/44_aliyevjavid.html "Aliyev Memorializes a Literary Giant,"] Azerbaijan International, Vol. 4:4 (Winter 1996), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
Monument to Javid was built in King's Park in [[Podgorica]] in 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2444">The '''Jaffna Tamil dialect''' is a [[Sri Lankan Tamil dialect|Tamil dialect]] that is native to the [[Jaffna Peninsula]] and it is also the  primary dialect used in the entire [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|North]] of [[Sri Lanka]]. The Jaffna Tamil dialect has very similar intonation to Malayalam ( Kerala in India) and therefore it is sometimes mistaken for Malayalam, when it's heard spoken in Tamil Nadu. Although, audibly, quite distinct from the spoken Tamil dialects of Tamil Nadu, it nevertheless shares the same standard written Tamil as in Tamil Nadu. If anything one could argue that the formal/ written Tamil is somewhat based on the Jaffna Tamil dialect as it was formulated and pioneered by the Jaffna Hindu Pundit Arumuga Navalar. He was much celebrated as the father of modern Tamil prose.

This dialect is largely distinct from other South Indian dialects and to a lesser extent from that of the [[Batticaloa Tamil dialect|Eastern]], [[Negombo Tamil dialect|Western]] and [[Hill Country Tamils|Upcountry]] dialects of Sri Lanka.

==Commonalities==
Jaffna Tamil and South Indian language of [[Malayalam]] have certain common linguistic [sic] that are not found in South Indian Tamil.In fact it is an often occurrence that a person from Jaffna be mistaken for a Malayali in [[Tamil Nadu]]. Both preserve certain archaic words which have gone out of vogue in South Indian Tamil. Consequently many consider the Jaffna dialect to be a purer form of Tamil.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,463af3be2,3ae6aaf99c,0,,,.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

A subdialect retained by the [[Paraiyar]] people of [[Kayts]] still retains a number of [[proto-Dravidian language|archaic words]] and Prakrit loans not found in any other dialects of Tamil. These drummers had historically played an important role as ritual players of drums at funerals and folk temples and as heralds and traditional [[Weaver (occupation)|weavers]]. They also maintained the family records of their [[feudalism|feudal]] [[lord]]s and even practiced medicine and astrology in folk traditions&lt;ref&gt;Ragupathy, ''Tamil Social Formation in Sri Lanka: A Historical Outline'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Bellenden''' or '''Ballantyne''' (flourished 1533-1587?) of [[Moray]] (why Moray, a lowland family) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] writer of the 16th century.

==Life==
[[File:Title page of John Bellenden Croniklis (1540).jpg|thumb|Title page of Bellenden's ''Croniklis'' printed in Edinburgh, with the heraldry of [[James V of Scotland]]]]
He was born towards the close of the 15th century, and educated at St. Andrews and Paris.
At the request of [[James V]] he translated [[Hector Boece]]'s ''Historia Gentis Scotorum''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
This translation, ''Croniklis of Scotland'' is a very free one, with a good deal of matter not in the original, so that it may be almost considered as a new work.
It was published in 1536 in Edinburgh by [[Thomas Davidson (printer)|Thomas Davidson]].
In 1533, Bellenden also translated the first five books of [[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Livy's ''History of Rome'']].&lt;ref&gt;John Bellenden, ''Livy's History of Rome'', 2 vols, Scottish Text Society (1901, 1903)&lt;/ref&gt;
These remain the earliest existing specimena of Scottish literary prose, and remarkable specimena they are, for the execution of which he enjoyed the Royal favour, and was made [[Archdeacon]] of [[Moray]]. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
Both the ''Croniklis'' and the ''Livy'' are prefaced by poems, the Proheme of the Chronicles, 'Quehen Silver Diane', being more often anthologised.&lt;ref&gt;''Scottish Poetry'', ed. M. M. Gray, London (1935): ''Bannatyne Manuscript'', Hunterian Club (1873), 9-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Another work, the ''Banner of Piety'', was prefaced by the poem 'Quhen goldin Phebus.'&lt;ref&gt;''Bannatyne Manuscript'', (1873), 3-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellenden latterly became involved in controversy which led to his being exiled to Rome, where he died, according to one account, about 1550. Another authority, however, states that he was still living in 1587.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Family connections==
John was the son of Patrick Bellenden of Auchnoule or Auchnolyshill (d.1514) and Mariota Douglas.&lt;ref&gt;''Register of the Great Seal of Scotland'', (1883), no.1886&lt;/ref&gt; Mariota was the nurse of James V. John's sister [[Katherine Bellenden]] was a courtier, connected with the royal wardrobe and worked with Janet Douglas, who was the wife of [[David Lyndsay]] of the Mount, the diplomat, poet, and playwright.&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 6, HM General Register House (1905), 298, 380-381, 390.&lt;/ref&gt; Katherine Bellenden was married to [[Moubray House|Adam Hopper]], then [[Francis Bothwell]], and thirdly to the royal favorite [[Oliver Sinclair]]. John's older brother [[Thomas Bellenden of Auchnoule]] was a prominent lawyer and courtier.&lt;ref&gt;Van Heijnsbergen, Theo, 'Literature in Queen Mary's Edinburgh: the Bannatyne Manuscript', in, ''The Renaissance in Scotland'', Brill (1994), p.191-6&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Klingon alphabets''' are [[fictional alphabet]]s used in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' movies and television shows to write the [[Klingon language]].

In [[Marc Okrand]]'s ''[[The Klingon Dictionary]]'' this alphabet is named as ''&lt;code&gt;pIqaD&lt;/code&gt;'', but no information is given about it. When Klingon symbols are used in Star Trek productions they are merely decorative graphic elements, designed to simulate real [[writing]] and to create an appropriate atmosphere.

The [[Astra Image Corporation]] designed the symbols (currently used to "write" Klingon) for ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'', although these symbols are often incorrectly attributed to [[Michael Okuda]].&lt;ref&gt;Symbols attributed to Okuda: the Klingon Language Institute's ''Klingon FAQ'' (edited by [[d'Armond Speers]]), [https://web.archive.org/web/20041012093544/http://higbee.cots.net/~holtej/klingon/faq.htm#2.13 question 2.13] by Will Martin (August 18, 1994). Symbols ''incorrectly'' attributed to Okuda: KLI founder Lawrence M. Schoen's [http://www.kli.org/pdf/Orthography.pdf "On Orthography" (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208232839/http://www.kli.org/pdf/Orthography.pdf |date=2006-12-08 }}, citing J. Lee's "An Interview with Michael Okuda" in the KLI's journal ''HolQed'' 1.1 (March 1992), p. 11. Symbols actually designed by Astra Image Corporation: Michael Everson's [[#_note-1|Proposal....&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]].&lt;/ref&gt; They based the letters on the [[Klingon starships|Klingon battlecruiser]] hull markings (three letters) first created by [[Matt Jeffries]], and on [[Tibetan script|Tibetan writing]] because the script had sharp letter forms—used as an allusion to the Klingons' love for bladed weapons.

== KLI pIqaD ==
[[Image:Kli piqad.GIF|thumb|The KLI pIqaD]]
[[Image:KLI piqad text sample.GIF|thumb|KLI pIqaD text sample]]
The KLI version of the pIqaD alphabet was created by an anonymous source at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], who based the alphabet on letters seen in the show. This source sent in the alphabet to the [[Klingon Language Institute]], and the KLI uploaded it onto its Web site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kli.org/about-klingon/writing-klingon&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of ''Klingonists'', however, still prefer the Latin alphabet.&lt;ref name=unicode/&gt;

The alphabet itself is quite simple: It contains twenty-six letters with a one-to-one ''grapheme-phoneme correspondence'': that is, one letter represents one sound and one sound is written with one letter. The set also includes ten numerals. It is written from left to right, top to bottom like English. There is no actual punctuation; however, those that use punctuation with the alphabet, use Skybox punctuation symbols (''see below'').

The KLI pIqaD script is registered in the ConScript registry in the Private Use Area of Unicode.&lt;ref name=F8D0/&gt;

Bing translate translates between many languages and Klingon, including the KLI pIqaD script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bing.com/translator/?from=en&amp;to=tlh-Qaak&amp;text=I%20am%20speaking%20Klingon | title=Klingon pIqaD use on Bing translate | date=November 25, 2015 | author=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bing currently{{when|date=August 2018}} uses a [[ISO 15924#Special codes|private use script code]] of "Qaak" for pIqaD instead of the official ISO 15924 script code "Piqd".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh456380.aspx|title=Microsoft Translator Language Codes|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google provides a Klingon language search interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/?hl=tlh|title=Google search interface using Klingon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ConScript Unicode Registry ==

In September 1997, [[Michael Everson]] made a proposal for encoding KLI pIqaD in [[Unicode]] based on the [[Linux kernel]] source code (specifically "Documentation/unicode.txt" by [[Hans Peter Anvin|H. Peter Anvin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n1643/n1643.htm | title=Proposal to encode Klingon in Plane 1 of ISO/IEC 10646-2 | date=September 18, 1997 | author=Michael Everson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Unicode Technical Committee rejected the Klingon proposal in May 2001 on the grounds that research showed almost no use of the script for communication, and the vast majority of the people who did use Klingon employed the Latin alphabet by preference.&lt;ref name=unicode&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/consortium/utc-minutes/UTC-087-200105.html | title=Approved Minutes of the UTC 87 / L2 184 Joint Meeting | date=August 14, 2001 | author=The Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modified version of the Linux kernel allocation for pIqaD in the [[Private Use Area]] of Unicode was added to the [[ConScript Unicode Registry]] (U+F8D0 to U+F8FF) by Michael Everson.&lt;ref name=F8D0&gt;{{cite web | title=Klingon: U+F8D0 - U+F8FF | url=http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/klingon.html | date=January 15, 2004 | author=Michael Everson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then several fonts using that encoding have appeared, and software for typing in pIqaD has become available. Existing text in [[Romanization]] can easily be converted to pIqaD also. Bing translator can translate between pIqaD and Latin forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bing.com/translator/?from=tlh&amp;to=tlh-Qaak&amp;text=nuqneH,%20tera%20font%20chenmoH%20jIH | title=Bing Translator | date=December 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a ConScript-compliant font is installed, the following PUA text should display:

:{{script|Piqd|{{PUA|&amp;#xf8d6;&amp;#xf8d4;&amp;#xf8d5;&amp;#xf8d9;&amp;#xf8e5;&amp;#xf8e9;&amp;#xf8da;&amp;#xf8d4;&amp;#xf8d6; &amp;#xf8e0;&amp;#xf8d0;&amp;#xf8e0; &amp;#xf8d8;&amp;#xf8d0;&amp;#xf8d8;&amp;#xf8e6;&amp;#xf8d0;&amp;#xf8da;&amp;#xf8fe;}}}}
:''&lt;code&gt;Heghlu’meH QaQ jajvam.&lt;/code&gt;''
:"Today is a good day to die."

The following is a [[pangram]]:

== Earlier variations ==
Until the [[Klingon Language Institute]] promoted a standardized alphabet for Klingon there were previous variations used primarily for decorative effect.  These variants were never adopted by the Klingon speaking community and aren't used in modern Klingon.

=== Skybox pIqaD ===

[[Image:Klingonalphabet.GIF|thumb|The Klingon pIqaD according to Skybox]]
[[Image:Klingon-text-sample 2.JPG|thumb|Skybox pIqaD text sample]]
The KLI adapted version of pIqaD utilizes the character set originally assembled by author Thomas E. Scheuer in his publication "Mortas-te-Kaase - the Death's Hand Battle Fleet" fan organization group operations manual (compiled, written, illustrated and published by author Thomas E. Scheuer from 1989–1994) which the author and founder of the KLI later became a member of, and learned of the MTK character assemblage and membership booklet designations, isn't the only mapping of Klingon letters. The ''Astra Image'' letters as released in the "Mortas-te-Kaase" were taken and used in the Paramount-endorsed [[Bitstream Inc|Bitstream]] font pack. They were used to make a font with ten letters of the English alphabet: "e" to "n" being represented by the ten different klingon letters. This font itself has been used by the Star Trek production team when creating Klingon graphics; however it is still used only as random gibberish on the shows. Dr. Schoen would often refer inquiries to Thomas Scheuer as he was still a student of the Klingon language at the time.  The Mortas-te-Kaase organisation was also in very close contact with linguist Marc Okrand, who was also an active member of MTK and would often release exclusive additional words and phrases through the regular publications of the organisation via their newsletter "veS QonoS".  Scheuer was never credited however, in any of Dr. Schoen's works or publications, and thus following commercial usage was not credited properly either. A copy of the original release as photocopied from MTK member manual is displayed at the right. (See also the MTK 1990 Klin-Kon flier utilizing the MTK pIqaD)

The trading card company [[SkyBox International|Skybox]] used this font when they created the Klingon language cards in their ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' trading card collection {{Year needed|date=September 2016}}. The Klingon cards themselves detail aspects of Klingon culture and feature pIqaD text and a transliteration and translation provided by Marc Okrand. Some of these cards, notably S7, S8, and S9, feature pIqaD, which corresponds to the Latin transcription.
Other known cards include [http://klingonska.org/canon/pic/1996-sbx-s19b.jpg S19] and [http://klingonska.org/canon/pic/1996-sbx-s20b.jpg S20] (which contain belittling references to ''Blockbuster'', probably an allusion to [[Blockbuster Video]]) the season seven card selection ''s37, s38 and s39'' (which featured no actual tlhIngan Hol, but only English and on card S39 Latin, written in the Skybox alphabet), and finally, the Checklist cards for each season's set of cards had the word ''cards'' written in Klingon on them when listing the above-mentioned cards.

The script is written in horizontal lines running from left to right, top to bottom, just like English. Klingon can be written with spaces between words (a word being defined as any noun, verb or leftover, plus any prefixes and suffixes attached to it) and [[punctuation]]. When this is the case, two punctuation marks are used:
* An "up-turned triangle" with a function similar to a [[comma]], [[semi-colon]] or [[colon (punctuation)|colon]].
* A "down-turned" triangle with a function similar to a [[full stop]], [[question mark]] or [[exclamation mark]].

The triangular punctuation marks have been accepted into the common usage of the KLI pIqaD (see above).

Klingon can also be written with no spaces or punctuation at all; this form is more common on the TV shows. As in English, Klingon text can be left-justified, center-justified, or right-justified, and written in vertical columns on banners.

Due to its nature, the "Skybox" Alphabet is ill-suited to writing Klingon, in that ambiguity in the alphabet is apparent, so different words are spelled the same way; these are [[homograph]]s. The heartiest commendations and the gravest insults could be written identically; however, context would go a long way to disambiguating homographs.

=== Mandel script ===
[[Image:Klinzhai alphabet.GIF|thumb|The Klinzhai alphabet]]
A third script, known as the Klinzhai or Mandel script, was included in ''The U.S.S. Enterprise Officer's Manual'' (1980). It holds more closely to the D7 battlecruiser hull markings and is also loosely based upon the conceptual art of Matt Jeffries, [[Star Trek: The Original Series|TOS]] set designer.

Its letters map to various letters and digraphs of English, but they have no relation to Marc Okrand's Klingon language. Like the other two alphabets, it is probably written in the same direction as English.

Some fans have suggested this alphabet could be used to write [[Klingonaase]] in its native form.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

In 1989, a fan by the name of David Christensen of Seattle, Wa., developed the first computer text font based on the Mandel script, prior to there being font software, meaning the font was built entirely in ResEdit.

==Wikipedia logo==
[[File:Wikipedia Logo 1.0.png|thumbnail|right|Wikipedia's logo used from 2003 until 2010]]
A pIqaD r (&lt;span style="font-family:pIqaD, Constructium, Unifont CSUR, Klingon pIqaD HaSta, Code2000;"&gt;{{PUA|&amp;#xf8e1;}}&lt;/span&gt;) using the [[Code2000]] font was used in the upper right corner of the [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia logos#Alphabets represented in the logo|Wikipedia globe logo]] from 2003 until 2010. It was replaced with the Ethiopic syllable wə (ው) in the [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia logos#The May 2010 redesign|May 2010 redesign]] of the logo.

[[Vatican City]] is a city state that came into existence in 1929. It is therefore to be clearly distinguished from the [[Holy See]], which already was in existence for many centuries before that date.

The [[Vatican Constitution]] has established no official language. However, in accordance with paragraph 2 of the ''Legge sulle fonti del diritto'' ("Law on the sources of law") of 7 June 1929, it promulgates its laws and regulations by publishing them in the Italian-language ''Supplemento per le leggi e disposizioni dello Stato della Città del Vaticano'' attached to the ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The text of the first seven items published in that supplement is given [http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/FBFEA0E8-B43A-452A-AAA0-1AF49590F658/2615/Supplemento.pdf here.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227194112/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/FBFEA0E8-B43A-452A-AAA0-1AF49590F658/2615/Supplemento.pdf |date=2010-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On its [https://web.archive.org/web/20101102133940/http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/homepage.htm official website] Vatican City uses [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Latin]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], which are found on the [http://www.vatican.va/ official website] of the [[Holy See]].

==Description==
Many languages are used within the state. For instance, recruits to the [[Swiss Guard#Pontifical Swiss Guard|Pontifical Swiss Guard]] take their oath in the language of the [[cantons of Switzerland|canton]] to which they belong: German, French or Italian.&lt;ref&gt;On the website of the [http://engl.schweizergarde.eu/ Swiss Guard shop] English also is found.&lt;/ref&gt; And the Holy See's semi-official newspaper, ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' is published in Italian, English, French, German, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. A [[Malayalam]] edition was added in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osservatoreromano.va/en L'Osservatore Romano]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Holy See]] itself mainly uses Latin for its most important official documents, which are published in the ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis''.

Since the state came into existence only in 1929, most of the buildings situated within it predated it by centuries: inscriptions can be found in them mainly in Latin, but also in Italian, Greek, French and German.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Campo Santo Teutonico|Camposanto Teutonico]]&lt;/ref&gt;

What became Vatican City was from 1870 to 1929 part of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], whose official language also was Italian, and before 1870 it was part of the [[Papal States]], in which standard Italian (based on [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]]) and various [[Regional Italian|Italian dialects]], such as [[Emiliano-Romagnolo]], were spoken, but which for the first centuries of its existence used Latin for all official purposes. Earlier still, it was part of the [[Roman Empire]]. In the earliest historical records the term "Vatican" was used to refer to a marshy area, larger than the Vatican City State, on the right bank of the Tiber River, between the Milvio Bridge and the present Sixtus Bridge. During the monarchy and the republican age, the area was known as ''Ager Vaticanus''. From the 2nd century A.D., the toponym ''Vaticanum'' was applied to an area corresponding roughly to the present Vatican City State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/State_and_Government/History/The_Vatican_City_during_the_times.htm Vatican City in the Past] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317155423/http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/State_and_Government/History/The_Vatican_City_during_the_times.htm |date=2008-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malay language|Malay]] is spoken by a minority of Filipinos, particularly in the [[Sulu Archipelago]] and parts of [[Mindanao]], mostly in the form of [[Malay trade and creole languages|trade and creole]] languages. Historically, Malay was spoken as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' prior to the Spanish colonization of the Philippines and Malay was the language spoken by the aristocracy. [[Ferdinand Magellan]] used a [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] servant [[Enrique of Malacca]] to converse with the [[Visayans]]. This variant is known as [[Old Malay]].

Even in non-Malay speaking communities, mostly in the Muslim communities, titles of nobility such as ''datu'' or ''rajah'' (which themselves originate from [[Sanskrit]]) are retained.

The other predominant, and the proper dialect of Malay spoken in the Philippines is [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], which is spoken by [[Native Indonesians|Indonesians]] who have either settled or do business in the Philippines. It is also learned as a foreign language, by students and members of the armed forces.

==History==
The use of Malay was a result of extensive interactions between the native kingdoms in the Philippines and the various ancient Malay civilizations that existed in modern-day [[Brunei]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]] as it was the trade language of the entire Maritime Southeast Asian region. The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]], the earliest-known document found in the Philippines was written in a mix of [[Old Malay]], Classical Tagalog and [[Old Javanese]] and in the [[Kawi alphabet]] which recorded interactions between the classical civilizations in [[Luzon]] with the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] kingdom of Majapahit and the [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] [[Srivijaya Empire]].

The Old Malay spoken in the archipelago also reflected the religious nature of the region - the archipelago was inhabited by a mix of Buddhist, Animists and Hindus. Upon the arrival of Portuguese conquistador [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in [[Cebu]], his slave, [[Enrique of Malacca|Enrique]], a Malaccan-native had to speak on his behalf since he was a native-Malay speaker who acted as a translator between Spanish, Portuguese and Malay. Enrique likely perished in Mactan Island during the [[Battle of Mactan|battle]] that killed Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. The name of ''Visayas'' itself originated from ''Srivijaya'', an ancient Malay empire that ruled [[Sumatra]] and parts of the [[Malay Peninsula]].

The use of Malay reached the height of its speak with the introduction of [[Islam]] by [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] Muslims, [[Arabs|Arab]], Chinese Muslim and Indian Muslim preachers to the islands. However, this was in the form of [[Classical Malay]], a dialect which originated from the Riau-Malacca region. Along with that, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] was also introduced as well as the introduction of the [[Jawi script]], an Arabic-based alphabet for Malay. The dynasties of the Islamic sultanates in Mindanao were themselves of ethnic [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] descent with sprinkles of [[Arabs|Arab]] ancestry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnlf.net/History/The%20Maguindanao%20Sultanate.htm |title=is for sale |publisher=Mnlf.net |date= |accessdate=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as those of the [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]].

With progress of Spanish conquest in the 1500s, the use of Malay among the Philippine natives quickly deteriorated and diminished as it was replaced by [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. It became non-existent among the Christian Filipinos. Malay remained much confined to the Muslim population of Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago, who actively resisted Spanish rule and attempts by missionaries to convert them to [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christianity]].

During the late 1800s, with the deterioration of [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish rule]], a Pan-Malayan movement began in the Philippines, spearheaded by national hero [[José Rizal]], who had a vision of "uniting the Malayan race" from the bondage of separation by colonial powers. He had actually tried learning the Malay language, having believed it to be an original of Tagalog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Paredes |first=Joel C. |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/57875/pre-malaysia-federation--the-malay-ties-that-bind-and-a-pan-malay-dream-betrayed |title=PRE-MALAYSIA FEDERATION &amp;#124; The 'Malay' ties that bind, and a pan-Malay dream betrayed |publisher=Interaksyon.com |date=2013-03-25 |accessdate=2016-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305073234/http://www.interaksyon.com/article/57875/pre-malaysia-federation--the-malay-ties-that-bind-and-a-pan-malay-dream-betrayed |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicians in the Philippines had actually contemplated on renaming the country to "Malaysia", before [[Malaysia|the actual federation]] was named so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sakai |first=Minako |editor1-last=Cao |editor1-first=Elizabeth |editor2-last=Morrell |title=Regional Minorities and Development in Asia |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |page=124 |url=http://www.sabrizain.org/malaya/library/connections.pdf |isbn=978-0-415-55130-4 |chapter=Reviving Malay Connections in Southeast Asia |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013055904/http://www.sabrizain.org/malaya/library/connections.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some maps had also referred to the area now comprising [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]] and [[East Malaysia]] as "Malaysia" as a whole.

Malay is related to the native languages of the Philippines, being Austronesian languages. Many words in the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[Visayan languages|various Visayan]] languages are derived from [[Old Malay]].

Although the history of Malay influence in Philippine history is a subject of conversation, no attempts have been made to ever promote Malay or even [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]]. The number of Malay-speakers in the Philippines are unknown, as a result of the 300-year Spanish rule most of them are very confined to the southern parts of [[Mindanao]] (specifically in the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]]) and the [[Sulu Archipelago]] in a region known as [[Bangsamoro (political entity)|Bangsamoro]]. This region, derives from the Malay word ''bangsa'' and the Spanish ''moro'', the Muslim peoples of the Philippines refer to themselves [[Moro people|Moro]] which comes from a Spanish word meaning "moor". These people more-less do not consider themselves ''Filipino''.

==Contemporary use==
The treatment of the Muslim peoples of Mindanao by the Christian-dominated government in the Philippines during the 1970s also worsened any hopes of Malay ever being revived into nationwide use again. Today [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and [[English language|English]] are the official languages of the [[Philippines]].

There are also misconceptions in the Philippines between [[Ethnic Malays]] and [[Malay race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2013/02/are-filipinos-malays/|title=Are Filipinos Malays?|author=Mong Palatino|publisher=[[The Diplomat]]|date=27 February 2013|accessdate=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is true that certain Filipino ethnic groups (namely the [[Visayans]] and [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanao]]) contain Malay ancestors; the ethnic Malays themselves are focused around [[Malay peninsular]], eastern [[Sumatra]], coastal [[Borneo]] and southern [[Thailand]]. The Malay race compasses a larger class of Austronesian ethnic groups in the entire Malay Archipelago. This results in false labels to pre-occupation rulers such as [[Lapu-Lapu]], the famous native chief who killed Magellan as a [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] and a Muslim although he was ethnically [[Visayans|Visayan]] who spoke [[Cebuano language|old Cebuano]] and whose religious background is obscure.

The [[Indonesian language]], which is the official dialect of Malay spoken in the Philippines' southern neighbor [[Indonesia]], has a notable presence of speakers in [[Davao City]] since the city is home to the Indonesian School which caters to expatriates in Mindanao and aims to protect Indonesian language and culture among the expatriate community.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=194092|periodical=Philippine Star|title=Fire hits Indonesian Cultural Center in Davao City|date=2003-02-04|accessdate=2011-06-20|first=Edith|last=Regalado}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesian is also taught as a foreign language in the [[University of the Philippines]].

Since 2013, the Indonesian Embassy in the Philippines has given basic Indonesian language courses to 16 batches of Filipino students, as well as training to members of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]]. Due to increasing demand among students, the Embassy will open an intermediate Indonesian language course later in the year. The Indonesian Embassy in Washington, D.C., USA also began offering free Indonesian language courses at the beginner and intermediate level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.embassyofindonesia.org/wordpress/?page_id=1105 |title=Indonesian Language Club &amp;#124; Embassy of Indonesia &amp;#124; Washington D.C |publisher=Embassy of Indonesia |date=2016-02-10 |accessdate=2016-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430171832/http://www.embassyofindonesia.org/wordpress/?page_id=1105 |archivedate=2016-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] Secretary [[Armin Luistro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rainier Alain|first=Ronda|title=Bahasa in schools? DepEd eyes 2nd foreign language|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2013/03/22/922576/bahasa-schools-deped-eyes-2nd-foreign-language|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=The Philippine Star|date=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; said that the country's government should promote Indonesian or Malaysian, which are related to Filipino and other regional languages. Thus, the possibility of offering it as an optional subject in public schools is being studied. Bahasa Melayu and Bahasa Indonesia is also spoken as a third or fourth language by native Filipinos of the Maguindanao and Tausug tribes, especially those who have studied in Malaysia, Indonesia as religious students, migrant laborers or long time residents in Sabah, Malaysia. It should also be noted that the dissemination of the Malay language was also through the usage of Malay books in the study of Islam.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12870">The phrase '''man bites dog''' is a shortened version of an [[aphorism]] in [[journalism]] which describes how an unusual, infrequent event (such as a man biting a dog) is more likely to be reported as news than an ordinary, everyday occurrence with similar consequences, such as a [[dog bite|dog biting a man]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues/ Owen Spencer-Thomas  ''News Values''. Accessed October 15, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; An event is usually considered more newsworthy if there is something unusual about it; a commonplace event is less likely to be seen as newsworthy, even if the consequences of both events have objectively similar outcomes. The result is that rarer events more often appear as news stories, while more common events appear less often, thus distorting the perceptions of news consumers of what constitutes normal rates of occurrence.

The phenomenon is also described in the journalistic saying, "You never read about a plane that did not crash".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06257/721583-152.stm | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=There's news in planes that don't crash | date=September 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was coined by [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe]] (1865–1922), a British newspaper magnate, but is also attributed to ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' editor John B. Bogart (1848–1921): "When a dog bites a man, that is not news, because it happens so often. But if a man bites a dog, that is news."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', 16th edition, ed. Justin Kaplan (Boston, London, and Toronto: Little, Brown, 1992), p. 554.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Luther Mott]] (1941) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=G3tWmzirWwoC American Journalism. A History of Newspapers in the United States through 250 Years, 1690 to 1940]''&lt;/ref&gt; The quote is also attributed to [[Charles Anderson Dana]] (1819–1897).&lt;ref&gt;Recollections of the Civil War By Charles Anderson Dana, Charles E. Rankin pp. xvi, xix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} Dushenko, K.

'''Megam''' is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language spoken in [[Kalmakanda Upazila|Kalmakanda subdistrict]], [[Netrokona district]], Dhaka division, [[Bangladesh]]. It is most closely related to [[Garo language|Garo]], but has been strongly influenced by [[Khasian languages]], to the extent that it is only 7–9% lexically similar to with A’beng, the neighboring Garo dialect, but 60% similar to the Khasian language [[Lyngngam language|Lyngngam]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10600">{{planes of existence}}
The '''mental plane''', or '''world of thought''', in [[Hermeticism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]], [[Rosicrucian]], [[Sri Aurobindo|Aurobindonian]], and [[New Age]] thought refers to the macrocosmic or universal [[Plane (cosmology)|plane]] or [[reality]] that is made up purely of [[thought]] or mindstuff. In contrast to [[Western world|Western]] [[secularism|secular]] [[modernism|modernist]] and [[postmodernism|post-modern]] thought, in [[Occultism|occult]] and [[esoteric cosmology]], thoughts and [[consciousness]] are not just a byproduct of [[brain]] functioning, but have their own [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] reality quite independent of the [[physical plane|physical]]. This reality itself constitutes only one gradation in a whole series of planes of [[existence]] (the total number of planes varies, although seven is a common number in Theosophical formulations). In most such cosmologies and explanations of reality, the mental plane is located between, and hence is intermediate between, the [[astral plane]] below and the higher spiritual realms of existence above.

== Predecessors of the concept ==

In India in the seventh century b.c.e., the [[Taittiriya Upanishad]] referred to five levels of self, of which the middle one is the "self made of mind" (''[[mana]]s''). Although the text is describing the nature of the individual rather than the cosmos as a whole, it established the concept of [[mind]] as only one of a series of [[ontology|ontological]] layers of being. The Taittiriyan concept of the five selves would represent an important element of Vedantic ontology, for example the five [[koshas]] of [[Advaita Vedanta]].

Meanwhile in Greece, and coming from a philosophical-mystical rather than a yogic perspective, [[Plato]] spoke of [[Platonic realism|archetypal forms or ideas]] as the original spiritual prototypes behind the physical world. These ideas were not equivalent to mind or thought as such. But they did eventually help inspire [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonic]] (including [[Philo]]'s) and [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] metaphysics in which the ideas exist in the mind of God or the Demiurge, or (according to [[Plotinus]] and hence Neoplatonism) the Divine Mind or ''[[Nous]]''. In the metaphysics of [[Proclus]], the Nous is only one level of [[Hypostasis (Neoplatonism)|hypostasis]], with higher ones like Life, Being, and Unity above it.

== Theosophical and Hermetic interpretations ==

The esoteric conception of the mental plane had to wait till the occult revival of the late 19th century, with the development of modern Theosophical, Hermetic, and Kabbalistic ideas that were to serve as the foundation for the current [[New Age]] movement.

[[H. P. Blavatsky]] taught a cosmology and ontology consisting of [[Septenary (Theosophy)|seven principles]] and seven [[Plane (cosmology)|planes]]. In her writings she aimed at showing how different spiritual systems share a common source, and therefore refers to Vedantic, Buddhist, Samkhyan, Tantric, Neoplatonic, Ancient Egyptian, Kabbalistic, and Occult systems. She relates the mind with the principle of ''Manas'', and also talks about a kosmic Manasic plane. However, the latter represents a very sublime level of consciousness which can be experienced only by enlightened beings.

In ''The Kabbalah Unveiled'', [[Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers|MacGregor Mathers]] divides the [[sephirot]] (apart from the lowest, ''Malkhut'', representing the physical world) of the [[Tree of Life]] into three triads: the Intellectual, Moral, and Astral triads. The Intellectual triad could be compared to the Neoplatonic ideas (Intellect = ''Nous'') and this here represents the highest subdivision.

Around the turn of the twentieth century, [[Max Théon|Max]] and [[Alma Théon]] were producing ''[[Cosmic Tradition|The Tradition]]''. This involved a [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Lurianic Kabbalistic]]-inspired cosmology in which the ineffable Godhead emanates a number of sublime worlds, the lowest of which is made up of seven or eight ''States''. The third or fourth lowest State is the Mental or Intellectual, which again corresponds to a very high, spiritual level of consciousness.

== The world of thought in the Western Wisdom Teachings ==

According to [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian]] writings, immediately beyond the higher regions of the [[astral plane|desire world]] &amp;mdash; which exhibit the marked peculiarity of blending [[Substantial form|form]] and [[sound]] &amp;mdash; and before entering the world of thought (mental plane), there is the "Great Silence", where all the world seems to disappear and the spirit has the feeling of floating in an ocean of intense light: all is one [[Eternity|eternal]] [[Now (time)|now]]. The world of thought is, according to this author, divided into two regions: the "Region of Concrete Thought" (inferior) related to the [[Mental body|mind]] and the "Region of Abstract Thought" (superior) related to the third (lower) aspect of the threefold Ego, the ''Human Spirit'' aspect.

His writings, called ''[[Western Wisdom Teachings]]'', describe that the [[Akashic Records|Memory of Nature]] may be read, in an entirely different manner covering the essence of a whole life, in the highest subdivision of the ''Region of Concrete Thought'' of the ''World of Thought''.

A discipline prevalent in the West is mathematics. The field was strengthened by [[Pythagoreanism]] and [[Philosophy]] ([[Platonism]], [[Neoplatonism]]), which were, alongside ancient Egyptian philosophy, among the oldest non-mythical wisdom paradigms. Math once meant "[[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]" and is still important within [[occultism]], especially topics farther beyond the earthly. Any mathematician who considers the mental plane's [[dimensionality]] equal to or more than the earthly one defines them as "hyperplanes." Classical [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] (other precursors of Heindel) may not have defined those dimensions, but several [[neo-Theosophy|neo-Theosophists]] call the mind 5-dimensional, (i.e. in [[Einstein]]-[[Minkowski]] [[spacetime]]) [[Platonism|Platonic]] terms such as [[nous]] or [[Nous]] (human or divine mind), synonymous (in contexts) with [[logistikon]]/[[logos]] or [[first cause|Protologos]]/[[causeless cause|Logos-Alogos]], and [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelean]] ([[empiricist]], including much/all [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]]) acceptance/use of the terms differ. They may reject that [[Causeless cause|Logos Alogos]] causes Protologos or [[Logos|Logoi]] cause/are [[Nous]], or that such or infinite dimensions enumerated in abstract philosophical [[logic]] have any use in semi-abstract/-concrete mathematical logic. However, contemporary philosophers are considering dimensions of [[M-theory]] physics.

== Some current definitions of the mental plane ==

The influence of [[C.W. Leadbeater]]'s work on the New Age movement has been underrated. One of Leadbeater's achievements was to make Blavatsky's difficult cosmology simpler and more understandable; for example by equating each of the [[Septenary (Theosophy)|seven principles]] or [[subtle body|vehicles of consciousness]] with a corresponding [[Plane (cosmology)|cosmic plane]]. So there is a physical body that is the vehicle of consciousness on the dense matter of the [[physical plane]]; an [[etheric body]], which is formed by the etheric matter found on subtler counterpart of the physical plane; an [[astral body]] that corresponds to the [[astral plane]]; a [[mental body]] which belongs to the lower mental plane, and a [[causal body]], or vehicle of the individual [[soul]], which is located at the level of the higher mental or [[Causal plane]].

Thus, for Leadbeater and subsequent theosophists, ex-theosophists (e.g. [[Alice Bailey]]) and occultists, the mental plane is a distinct reality or zone of being, more subtle and refined than the Astral, but denser and coarser than the Causal. A detailed account of The Mental Plane and the Mental Body and their associated phenomena, as described by Leadbeater and his co-worker [[Annie Besant]] (who succeeded Blavatsky as head of the Theosophical Society), can be found in [[Arthur E. Powell]]'s ''The Mental Body''.

[[Sri Aurobindo]] developed a very different concept of the mental plane, through his own synthesis of Vedanta (including the Taittiriya Upanishad), Tantra, Theosophy, and Theon's ideas (which he received via [[Mirra Alfassa|The Mother]], who was Théon's student in occultism for two years). In this cosmology, there are seven cosmic planes, three lower, corresponding to relative existence (the [[Physical (Sri Aurobindo)|Physical]], [[Vital (Sri Aurobindo)|Vital]], and [[Mental (Sri Aurobindo)|Mental]]), and four higher, representing infinite divine reality (''[[The Life Divine|Life Divine]]'' bk. 1 ch. 27). The Aurobindonian Mind or mental plane constitutes a large zone of being from the mental vital to the [[Overmind (Sri Aurobindo)|overmental]] divine region (''[[Letters on Yoga]]'', Jyoti and Prem Sobel 1984), but as with the later Theosophical concept it constitutes an objective reality of pure mind or pure thought.

'''Satyanarayana Moturi''' (2 February 1902 – 6 March 1995) was an Indian freedom fighter alongside [[Mohandas Gandhi]] until 1947 and then a member of the [[Constituent Assembly of India]] which drafted the [[Indian Constitution]]. He was a nominated member of the [[Rajya Sabha]] (the Upper House in the Indian government) until 1966.&lt;ref name="The Rajya Sabha Site"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nominated members since 1952|url=http://164.100.47.5/Newmembers/since1952.aspx|publisher=Rajya Sabha Secretariat, New Delhi|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was instrumental in making Hindi an official language in the Indian Constitution, while tolerating the other major Indian languages.  He devoted his later life to helping spread Hindi in South India.

==Early life, Family, and Education==
Moturi was born in [[Dondapadu]] village in the [[Krishna district]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]], India. After his primary education, he studied English, Telugu, and Hindi at the National College in Machilipatnam, achieving a high proficiency in them.  He joined the [[Dakshin Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha]] as a volunteer and gradually became the Secretary and Principal Secretary of that organisation. A major mission in his life would be to efficiently promote the growth of Hindi in [[South India]] between 1936 and 1961.  He married Shrimati Suryakanta Devi and had three sons and four daughters with her.

==Activism in the Indian Independence Movement (1925–1947)==
Moturi participated in [[Quit India Movement]] in 1942 and was jailed. 
  
During this time, Moturi was an active promoter of the Hindi language.  He was the Editor of "Hindi Pracharak" (1926–36), "Hindi Prachar Samachar" (1938–61) and Dakshina Bharat (1947–61). He organised many Institutions all over India such as "Dakshina Bharata Hindi Prachara Sabha" of Madras (1926–61). He was the Founding Secretary of "Telugu Basha Samithi" of Madras and Hyderabad.

==Framer of the Indian Constitution (1948–50)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cadindia.clpr.org.in/|title=CADIndia|website=cadindia.clpr.org.in|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
After India became independent from Britain, Moturi was a member of the [[Constituent Assembly of India]] from 1948–50.  He served as a Member of the Drafting Committee of the Indian Constitution for its Language Section.  He was a key figure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cadindia.clpr.org.in/constituent_assembly_members/moturi_satyanarayana|title=CADIndia|website=cadindia.clpr.org.in|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the divisive debates on: what to make the official language of India (Hindi, English, or a number of local languages such as Bengali, Telugu, Tamil, etc.); how to set up a pluralistic civil service examination system; and how to balance local languages with national languages at different levels of government. He [http://cadindia.clpr.org.in/constitution_assembly_debates/volume/9/1949-09-14?paragraph_number=185#9.140.185 advocated] for drafting of the Constitution in Indian languages first.

==Member of India's Parliament (1950–66)==
After Indian Independence, from 1950–52, Moturi was a member of the Provisional Parliament of India as an MP.  After the Indian Constitution was drafted, Moturi was nominated by the [[President of India]] as a [[Rajya Sabha]] (Upper House) member.  He served twice between 1954 and 1966 (3 April 1954 to 2 April 1960 and 3 April 1960 to 2 April 1966).  He was also a member of: the Madras Legislative Council (1952–54); the Central Advisory Board of Education of the Govt. of India; the Madras University Senate (1952–53); the Central Official Languages Commission (1954–56).

==Scholarly Interests and Propagation of Hindi through India==
Moturi had many scholarly interests.  He was the Chief Editor of Encyclopedia on Social Sciences in Hindi published by the Hindi Vikas Samithi, Madras. He was the founding secretary of the [[Telugu Bhasha Samiti]]. He also founded the [[Hindi Vikas Samiti]] and published 'Vishwa Vignana Samhita.'  Finally, Moturi was an editor for a comprehensive encyclopaedia published in his native language of Telugu.

==Awards and Death==
Later in his life, Moturi won many awards.  He was a recipient of the [[Padma Shri]] award in 1954 and the [[Padma Bhushan]] award in 1962,&lt;ref name="Padma Awards"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf | title=Padma Awards | publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India | date=2015 | accessdate=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; both from the Government of India.  [[Andhra University]] honoured him with its [[Kala Prapoorna]] award in 1977.

Moturi lived to the age of 93.  When a family member asked the nonagenarian Moturi about the secret of his longevity, his brief response was:  "Listen more, eat less."

==Legacy==
As an activist for Indian Independence, a framer of the Indian Constitution, and a Parliamentarian, Moturi was a key figure in India's political history.  However, some people criticise his decision to support Hindi, and not English, as the official language of India.  The awkward provisions in the Indian Constitution and a later push by pro-Hindi hardliners led to "language riots" in the 1960s in southern states such as Tamil Nadu, where more than 60 people died.  Several students immolated themselves protesting the forced use of Hindi as the national language.  While English has become the de facto national language of India by 2010, the Indian Constitution has continued to serve as the fundamental basis of the India's polity and society and its drafting was a major accomplishment.

'''Vaidyanath Mishra''' (30 June 1911 – 5 November 1998), better known by his [[pen name]] '''Nagarjun''', was a [[Hindi]] and [[Maithili language|Maithili]] poet who has also penned a number of novels, short stories, [[Biography in literature|literary biographies]] and travelogues, and was known as ''Janakavi''- the People's Poet. 
He is regarded as the most prominent protagonist of modernity in Maithili.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98nov29/sunday/head4.htm An ocean of intellect passes into history] ''[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]'', 29 November 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv5n1/nagarjun.htm Obituary] ''www.revolutionarydemocracy.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life and biography==

=== Early life and education ===
Vaidyanath Mishra was born on 30 June 1911, in the village of Satlakha in [[Madhubani District]] of [[Bihar]], India, which was his mother's village, his original village is Tarauni in [[Darbhanga district]], Bihar. He later converted to [[Buddhism]] and got the name ''Nagarjun''. His mother died when he was only three, and his father being a vagabond himself, couldn't support him so young Vaidya Nath thrived on the support of his relatives, and the scholarships he won on the account of him being an exceptional student. Soon he became proficient in [[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]] and [[Prakrit]] languages, which he first learnt locally and later at [[Varanasi]] and [[Calcutta]], where he was also semi-employed, while pursuing his studies. Meanwhile he married Aparajita Devi and the couple had six children.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

=== Career ===
He started his literary career with [[Maithili language|Maithili]] poems by the pen-name of '''Yatri''' (यात्री) in the early 1930s. By the mid 1930s, he started writing poetry in Hindi. His first permanent job of a full-time teacher, took him to [[Saharanpur]] ([[Uttar Pradesh]]), though he didn't stay there for long as his urge to delve deeper into Buddhist scriptures, took him to the Buddhist monastery at [[Kelaniya]], [[Sri Lanka]], where in 1935, he became a [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]], entered the [[vihara|monastery]] and studied the scriptures, just as his mentor, [[Rahul Sankrityayan]] had done earlier, and hence took upon the name "Nagarjun". While at the monastery, he also studied [[Leninism]] and [[Marxism]] ideologies, before returning to India in 1938 to join 'Summer School of Politics' organised by noted peasant leader, [[Sahajanand Saraswati]], founder of [[All India Kisan Sabha|Kisan Sabha]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040814041633/http://cc.domaindlx.com/aapanmithila/poet.htm#Nagarjun Poets of Mithila – Nagarjun]&lt;/ref&gt; A wanderer by nature, Nagarjun spent a considerable amount of his time in the 1930s and the 1940s travelling across India.

He also participated in many mass-awakening movements before and after independence. Between 1939 and 1942, He was jailed by the British courts for leading a farmer's agitation in Bihar. For a long time after independence he was involved with journalism.

He played an active role in [[Jayaprakash Narayan]]'s movement prior to the [[The Emergency (India)|Emergency period]] (1975–1977), and therefore was jailed for eleven months, during the emergency period. He was strongly influenced by Leninist-Marxist ideology. This was one of the reasons that he never found patronage from the mainstream political establishments.

He died in 1998 at the age of 87 in [[Darbhanga]].

== Works and literature ==
The subjects of his poetry are varied. Effects of both his wandering tendencies and activism, is evident in his middle and later works. His famous poems like ''Bādal kō Ghiratē Dēkhā hai'' ({{lang-hi|बादल को घिरते देखा है}}), is a travelogue in its own right. He often wrote on contemporary social and political issues. His famous poem ''Mantra Kavita'' (मंत्र कविता), is widely considered the most accurate reflection of a whole generation's mindset in India. Another such poem is ''Āō Rānī Hum Ḍhōēṅgē Pālakī'' ({{lang-hi|आओ रानी हम ढोएंगे पालकी}}), which sarcastically humiliates the then prime minister of India, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], for the extravagant welcome thrown by him for [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]].

Besides these accepted subjects of poetry, Nagarjun found poetic beauty in unconventional subjects. One of his most astonishing works is a poem based on a saw called ''With Sharp Teeth'' ({{lang|hi|पैने दाँतो वाली}}). Another such creation is a series of poems on a full-grown [[jackfruit]].

Because of the breadth of his poetry, Nagarjun is considered the only Hindi poet after [[Tulsidas]] to have an audience ranging from the rural sections of society to the elite. He effectively freed poetry from the bounds of elitism.

== Languages ==
[[Maithili language|Maithili]] was his mother tongue and he authored many poems, essays and novels in Maithili. He was educated in [[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]], and [[Hindi]]. Hindi remained the language of the bulk of his literature. The Hindi of his works varies from highly [[sanskrit]]ized to [[vernacular]] forms. He was a poet of the masses, and preferred to write in the language of immediate local impact. Therefore he never adhered to specific bounds of languages.

He also had good grasp of the [[Bengali language]] and used to write for Bengali newspapers. He was close to the Bengali [[Hungry generation]] or ''Bhookhi Peerhi'' poets and helped Kanchan Kumari in translating [[Malay Roy Choudhury]]'s long poem ''JAKHAM'' and Chana Jor Garam in Hindi

== Awards ==
Nagarjun was given the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] in 1969 for his historic book ''Patarheen Nagna Gachh'', and the 'Bharat Bharati Award' by the [[Uttar Pradesh]] government for his literary contributions in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapsofindia.com/who-is-who/literature/nagarjun.html Hindi authors]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also honoured by the [[List of Sahitya Akademi fellows|Sahitya Akademi Fellowship]], India's highest literary award for lifetime achievement, in 1994.

'''Pink vote''' refers to the voting rights of [[gay]]s and [[lesbian]]s. So, every [[vote]] that a gay or lesbian can cast is referred to as the pink vote. Most prevalent in Britain, the concept has already spread to [[US]] and [[Canada]] with many other countries like [[South Africa]] and [[Australia]] starting to acknowledge it. In addition, there are socio-political movements and political groups formed by [[LGBT]] people who are linked to political parties.

==United Kingdom==
According to the [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS), 1.00% of the total population in UK is [[homosexual]] and so, 480,000 people consider themselves gay or lesbian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11398629|title= UK gay, lesbian and bisexual population revealed|author=bbc | work=BBC News|date=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political parties in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] now aim at the pink vote bank and leave no stone unturned to persuade the homosexual community to vote in their favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/battle-for-pink-vote-gets-poisonous-1731253.html|title= Battle for pink vote gets poisonous |author= independent | location=London|work=The Independent|date=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/06/labour-conservatives-gay-rights|title= Why Tories are winning the pink vote |author= guardian | location=London|work=The Guardian|date=6 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1455353/Howard-to-woo-pink-vote-at-gay-summit.html|title= Howard to woo 'pink vote' at gay summit |author= telegraph | location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=26 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The significance of pink vote has increased considerably with the changing times. Charles Kennedy of The Liberal Democrats pitched for the "pink vote" and even promised a package of ways to boost homosexual rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/kennedy-woos-the-pink-vote-with-pledge-to-extend-gay-rights-694750.html |title= Kennedy woos the 'pink vote' with pledge to extend gay rights |author= independent | location=London |work=The Independent |date=6 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the PM and the Conservative leader took measures to win the UK's three million pink voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/2517277/Leaders-fight-for-the-pink-vote.html|title= Leaders fight for the pink vote|author= thesun | location=London|work=The Sun|date=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
According to the research report by Gallup, Americans interviewed estimated the gay population to be around one in every fifth person in the [[US]] which would account for almost 20% of the overall population, while actual numbers are estimated to be 10% or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/6961/what-percentage-population-gay.aspx|title=Percentage of Homosexual Population|author= gallup }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This percentage does play a big role in the [[elections]] and political parties try every way to attract these pink voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=_2QEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=gay+and+lesbian+votes+US+elections&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M-mGRYYVB-&amp;sig=kKYR2O3ExTmbZqi6GgmVtXJmzEk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YgH3TbePPMrz-gbxlPH7Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=gay%20and%20lesbian%20votes%20US%20elections&amp;f=false|title=Kerry Plans for Gay America|author= The Advocate }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/feb/24/johnpatterson.awardsandprizes|title= The pink vote |author= guardian | location=London|work=The Guardian|date=24 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LGBT Democrats]] (linked to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]) and [[Log Cabin Republicans]] (linked to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]) are two of the largest American political groups advocated to LGBT rights issues in politics.

==Changing times==
With the visible impact of the pink vote in Britain, Canada’s political scenario also caught up with the pink vote politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/fullcomment/archive/2009/07/16/kelly-mcparland-cameron-and-pride.aspx|title= Kelly McParland: Harper could take a cue from Cameron on Pride|author= nationalpost}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new idea has also been a topic of debate in the Australia's political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=6644|title= The new pink vote |author= onlineopinion }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are countries like South Africa where the pink vote is yet to acquire such importance and the homosexual community is yet to be given any added importance in elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.timeslive.co.za/specialreports/elections2011/article1067518.ece/Pink-vote-still-up-for-grabs |title= Pink vote still up for grabs |author= timeslive }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In focus==
There have also been debates about the impact of pink votes and their existence in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/mar/26/gayrights.conservatives|title= Can you be pink and true blue?|author= guardian | location=London|work=The Guardian|date=26 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of such debates, fever of the pink vote even caught up Oscars as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/feb/24/johnpatterson.awardsandprizes|title= The pink vote |author= guardian | location=London|work=The Guardian|date=24 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="996">'''Previews''' are a set of public performances of a [[theatre|theatrical]] presentation that precede its official opening. The purpose of previews is to allow the [[theatre director|director]] and [[crew]] to identify problems and opportunities for improvement that weren't found during [[rehearsal]]s and to make adjustments before [[critic]]s are invited to attend. The duration of the preview period varies, and ticket prices may be reduced.

The term can also be used to describe an exhibition of a film to evaluate an audience's reaction and make possible changes before its official release. (This is different from a "[[film trailer|trailer]]", a short advertisement for a finished film.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="612">A '''production set''' is a place constructed to create the illusion of a real or imagined place. In [[filmmaking]] there are many reasons to build or use a set instead of traveling to a real location. Factors such as [[budget]], time, the need to control the environment, or the fact that the place does not exist can be reasons to film on a set. Sets are normally constructed on a [[film studio]] [[backlot]] or [[sound stage]], but any place that has been modified to give the feel of another place is a set.

SYSTRAN has done extensive work for the [[United States Department of Defense]] and the [[European Commission]]. 

SYSTRAN provides the technology for [[Yahoo! Babel Fish]] among others. It was used by Google's [[List of Google products#anchor_language_tools|language tools]] until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Google Switches to Its Own Language System, ''Google Operating System'', October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; SYSTRAN is used by the Dashboard Translation widget in [[OS X]].

Commercial versions of SYSTRAN can run on [[Microsoft Windows]] (including [[Windows Mobile]]), [[Linux]], and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]. Historically, SYSTRAN systems used [[Rule-based machine translation]] (RbMT) technology. With the release of SYSTRAN Server 7 in 2010, SYSTRAN implemented a hybrid rule-based/[[Statistical machine translation]] (SMT) technology which was the first of its kind in the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grunwald|first=David|title=Inside SYSTRAN Training Server 7|url=http://blog.gts-translation.com/2011/05/26/inside-systran-training-server-7/|publisher=GTS|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2008}}, the company had 59 employees of whom 26 are computational experts and 15 computational linguists.&lt;ref name=2008FinancialReport&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.systransoft.be/download/annual-reports/systran-annual-report-2008.pdf | title=SYSTRAN annual financial report 2008 | format=PDF | accessdate=2012-04-04 | year=2008 | publisher=SYSTRAN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of employees decreased from 70 in 2006 to 59 in 2008.&lt;ref name=2008FinancialReport /&gt;

== History ==

With its origin in the [[Georgetown-IBM experiment|Georgetown]] machine translation effort, SYSTRAN was one of the few machine translation systems to survive the major decrease of funding after the [[ALPAC|ALPAC Report]] of the mid-1960s. The company was established in [[La Jolla, San Diego, California|La Jolla]] in California to work on translation of Russian to English text for the [[United States Air Force]] during the [[Cold War]]. Large numbers of Russian scientific and technical documents were translated using SYSTRAN under the auspices of the USAF Foreign Technology Division (later the National Air and Space Intelligence Center) at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], Ohio. The quality of the translations, although only approximate, was usually adequate for understanding content.

The company was sold in 1986 to the Gachot family, based in [[Paris]], and is now traded publicly on the French stock exchange. Its company headquarters is in Paris, while its U.S. headquarters is still in La Jolla.

During the [[dot-com boom]], the international [[language industry]] started a new era, and SYSTRAN entered into agreements with a number of translation integrators, the most successful of these being [[WorldLingo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://translations.com/services/language-services/machine-translation.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqI23ycHO2QIVBw5pCh1nDAxVEAAYASAAEgJZgvD_BwE#WorldLingo|title=Machine Translation|date=2016-12-01|website=translations.com|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In 2014, the company was acquired by CSLi (Korea).&lt;ref&gt;http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_business/639506.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business situation ==

Most of SYSTRAN's revenue comes from a few customers. 57.1% comes from the 10 main customers and the three largest customers account for 10.9%, 8.9%, and 8.9% of its revenues, respectively.&lt;ref name="2008FinancialReport"/&gt; Revenues had been declining in the early 2000s: 10.2 million euros in 2004, 10.1 million euros in 2005, 9.3 million euros in 2006, 8.8 million euros in 2007, and 7.6 million euros in 2008,&lt;ref name="2008FinancialReport"/&gt; before seeing a rebound in 2009 with 8.6 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.systransoft.be/download/annual-reports/systran-annual-report-2009.pdf | title=SYSTRAN annual financial report 2009 | format=PDF | accessdate=2012-04-04 | page=63 | year=2009 | publisher=SYSTRAN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|sfumato}}

'''Sfumato''' ({{IPA-it|sfuˈmaːto|lang}}, {{IPAc-en|lang|s|f|uː|ˈ|m|ɑː|t|oʊ}}) is a painting technique for softening the transition between colours, mimicking an area beyond what the human eye is focusing on, or the out-of-focus plane.  [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was the most prominent practitioner of sfumato, based on his research in optics and human vision, and his experimentation with the camera obscura. He used it in many works, including the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' and in his famous painting of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. He described sfumato as "without lines or borders, in the manner of smoke or beyond the focus plane".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Earls |first= Irene |title= Renaissance Art: A Topical Dictionary |year= 1987 |publisher= Greenwood Press |isbn= 0-313-24658-0 |pages= 263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the theory of the art historian [[Marcia B. Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Marcia B.|title=Color and Meaning: Practice and Theory in Renaissance Painting|date=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-521-45733-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has gained considerable acceptance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four Canonical Painting Modes by APA|url=http://artpaintingartist.org/the-four-canonical-painting-modes-of-the-renaissance/}}. Retrieved June 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; ''sfumato'' is one of four modes of painting colours available to Italian [[High Renaissance]] painters, along with ''[[cangiante]]'', [[chiaroscuro]] and ''[[unione]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Marcia B., ''Rome'' (series "Artistic Centers of the Italian Renaissance"), pp.148-150, 2005, Cambridge University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0521624452}}, 9780521624459, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gt5gtrqoKOIC&amp;pg=PA148 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "sfumato" comes from the Italian language and is derived from "fumo" (''smoke'', ''fume''). "Sfumato" translated into English means ''soft, vague or blurred''. In Italian the word is often used as an adjective (like "biondo sfumato" for ''pale blonde'' hair) or as a verb ("l'affare è sfumato" would mean ''the deal has gone up in smoke'').  The use of the term (unlike some others) dates back to the period.

== Technique ==
The technique is a fine shading meant to produce a soft transition between colours and tones, in order to achieve a more believable image. It is most often used by making subtle gradations that do not include lines or borders, from areas of light to areas of dark. The technique was used not only to give an elusive and illusionistic rendering of the human face but also to create rich atmospheric effects. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] described the technique as blending colours, without the use of lines or borders "in the manner of smoke".

==Practitioners==
Besides Leonardo and his followers the [[Leonardeschi]], who often used it heavily, other prominent practitioners of sfumato included [[Correggio]], [[Raphael]] and [[Giorgione]]. Raphael's ''[[Madonna del Prato (Raphael)|Madonna of the Meadow]]'' is a famous example, particularly around Mary's face. The Leonardeschi include [[Bernardino Luini]] and Funisi.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Somen Chanda''' ({{lang-bn|সোমেন চন্দ}}; 24 May 1920 – 8 March 1942) was a [[Marxism|Marxist]] activist, writer and trade union leader of [[Bengal]].

==Early life==
Somen Chanda was born in [[Narsingdi District]], [[British India]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/in-focus/we-shall-overcome-1355557|title=We shall overcome|last=|first=|date=February 4, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 he passed Entrance examination from [[Pogose School]] and entered in medical school attached with [[Mitford Hospital, Dhaka|Mitford hospital]] in [[Dhaka|Dacca]]. He was attracted to [[Marxism|marxist politics]] and [[trade union movement]] in student life.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sansab Bangali Charitavidhan (Bengali)|last=Vol - I|first=Subodh C. Sengupta &amp; Anjali Basu|publisher=Sahitya Sansad|year=2002|isbn=81-85626-65-0|location=Kolkata|pages=606}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Literary works==
Chanda joined in [[Progressive Writers' Movement|Progressive Writers' Association]] or ''Pragati Lekhak Sangha'' and [[Anti-fascism|anti fascist]] activism in Dhaka. He wrote his first novel Banya while he was at 17. He wrote number of short stories, drama and articles in their literary journals which were collectively published posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libnet.vidyasagar.ac.in/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=11176&amp;query_desc=su%3A%7BBANGLA%20SAHITYA-KABYA%7D%20and%20itype%3ABK|title=Soumen Chanda o tar rachana sangraha|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His stories were translated in many languages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Death==
While leading a rally of workers of [[East Bengal Railway]] organised by the Soviet Suhrid Samity in Dhaka, Chanda was attacked by some hooligans and killed brutally on 8 March. 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MK-gKwmDf0sC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=Somen+Chanda+Dhaka&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y_YQQYRzw8&amp;sig=sgitiAsYP9gKTD3VB0F-IhQe_gA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjRlIufuuzaAhWJto8KHTCuBuM4ChDoAQgkMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Somen%20Chanda%20Dhaka&amp;f=false|title=Arun Mitra|last=Abanti K.

==Representation==
The semantics of what a text graph's nodes and edges represent can vary widely. Nodes for example can simply connect to tokenized words, or to domain-specific terms, or to entities mentioned in the text. The edges, on the other hand, can be between these text-based tokens or they can also link to a [[knowledge base]].

==TextGraphs Workshop series==
The TextGraphs Workshop series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textgraphs.org/|title=Textgraphs|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a series of regular [[academic workshop]]s intended to encourage the synergy between the fields of [[natural language processing]] (NLP) and [[graph theory]]. The mix between the two started small, with graph theoretical framework providing efficient and elegant solutions for NLP applications that focused on single documents for part-of-speech tagging, word sense disambiguation and semantic role labelling, got progressively larger with ontology learning and information extraction from large text collections.

The [https://sites.google.com/site/textgraphs2017/ 11th edition of the workshop (TextGraphs-11)] will be collocated with the Annual Meeting of [[Association for Computational Linguistics]] ([http://acl2017.org/ ACL 2017]) in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia|BC]], [[Canada]].

'''Vallon Man''' is a term used by the [[British Army]] waging war in [[Afghanistan]] to denote the soldier in a patrol who carries the [[mine detector]]. The term originated from "Vallon Machine", another word used for mine detector (the Vallon mine detector VMR3 was widely used in Afghanistan because of its [[Ground-penetrating radar|unique ground penetrating radar]] (GPR). Using a GPR is the only way to find metal free mines and [[Improvised explosive device|improvised explosive devices (IED)]]. The role of Vallon Man is one of the most dangerous in the fighting in Afghanistan, as Vallon men are often killed in their work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3032">In [[logic]] and [[model theory]], a '''valuation''' can be:
*In [[propositional logic]], an assignment of [[truth value]]s to [[propositional variable]]s, with a corresponding assignment of truth values to all [[propositional formula]]s with those variables.
*In [[first-order logic]] and higher-order logics, a [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]], (the [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]) and the corresponding assignment of a truth value to each sentence in the language for that structure (the valuation proper). The interpretation must be a [[homomorphism]], while valuation is simply a [[function (mathematics)|function]].

==Mathematical logic==

In mathematical logic (especially model theory), a valuation is an assignment of truth values to formal sentences that follows a [[T-schema|truth schema]]. Valuations are also called truth assignments.

In propositional logic, there are no quantifiers, and formulas are built from propositional variables using logical connectives. In this context, a valuation begins with an assignment of a truth value to each propositional variable. This assignment can be uniquely extended to an assignment of truth values to all propositional formulas.

In first-order logic, a language consists of a collection of constant symbols, a collection of function symbols, and a collection of relation symbols. Formulas are built out of [[atomic formula]]s using logical connectives and quantifiers.  A [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] consists of a set ([[domain of discourse]]) that determines the range of the quantifiers, along with interpretations of the constant, function, and relation symbols in the language. Corresponding to each structure is a unique truth assignment for all [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] (formulas with no [[free variables]]) in the language.

== Notation ==
If &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is a valuation, that is, a mapping from the atoms to the set &lt;math&gt;\{ t, f \}&lt;/math&gt;, then the double-bracket notation is commonly used to denote a valuation; that is, &lt;math&gt;v(\phi)=[[\phi]]_v&lt;/math&gt; for a proposition &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk van Dalen, (2004) ''Logic and Structure'', Springer Universitext, (''see section 1.2'') {{isbn|978-3-540-20879-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2665">A '''viseme''' is any of several [[speech sound]]s that look the same, for example when [[lip reading]] (Fisher 1968).

Visemes and [[phoneme]]s do not share a one-to-one correspondence. Often several phonemes correspond to a single viseme, as several phonemes look the same on the face when produced, such as {{IPA|/k, ɡ, ŋ/}}, (viseme: /k/), {{IPA|/t͡ʃ, ʃ, d͡ʒ, ʒ/}} (viseme: /ch/), {{IPA|/t, d, n, l/}} (viseme: /t/), and {{IPA|/p, b, m/}} (viseme: /p/). Thus words such as ''pet, bell,'' and ''men'' are difficult for lip-readers to distinguish, as all look like /pet/. However, there may be differences in timing and duration during actual speech in terms of the visual 'signature' of a given gesture that can not be captured with a single photograph. Conversely, some sounds which are hard to distinguish acoustically are clearly distinguished by the face (Chen 2001). For example, acoustically speaking English {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} can be quite similar (especially in clusters, such as 'grass' vs. 'glass'), yet visual information can show a clear contrast. This is demonstrated by the more frequent mishearing of words on the telephone than in person. Some [[linguistics|linguists]] have argued that speech is best understood as bimodal (aural and visual), and comprehension can be compromised if one of these two domains is absent ([[McGurk effect|McGurk and MacDonald 1976]]). 

Visemes can often be humorous, as in the phrase "elephant juice," which when lip-read appears identical to "I love you."

Applications for the study of visemes include [[speech processing]], [[speech recognition]], and [[computer facial animation]].
