'''Selwyn Bougard''', now known as '''El-Divine Amir Bey''', better known by his stage name '''4th Disciple''', is a sonic artist and audio engineer who was one of the founding members of [[Killarmy]] and one of the best-known [[List of Wu-Tang Clan affiliates|Wu-Tang-affiliated producers]]. He is the only member of the Wu Elements to have worked on the Clan's first breakthrough album, as a mixer.

== Biography ==
After being a turntablist on the Wu-Tang Clan's debut album, ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'', 4th Disciple co-produced and helped mix several tracks with the [[RZA]] on the first three Wu-Tang solo ventures by various artists, including co-production for "Sub Crazy" by [[Method Man]], "Damage" by [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] as well as mixing credits for some of [[Raekwon]]'s ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...]]'', on the tracks "Criminology," "Guillotine (Swordz)," "Spot Rusherz," and "Wu-Gambinos." 4th Disciple then produced what was at the time only the second Wu-Tang track ever to lack a RZA production credit, when the [[Killah Priest]] solo track "B.I.B.L.E. (Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth)" was included on [[GZA]]'s ''[[Liquid Swords]]''. This led to five 4th Disciple productions appearing on the double album ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]]''.

After producing 15 of the 17 tracks on Killarmy's debut album, ''[[Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars]]'', and contributing significant production to the debut albums of [[Killah Priest]] (''[[Heavy Mental]]'') and [[Sunz of Man]] (''[[The Last Shall Be First (Sunz of Man album)|The Last Shall be First]]''), 4th Disciple's beats continued to appear on the solo work of the Clan members, including Inspectah Deck and Method Man. However, more recently, 4th Disciple has been concentrating his production on Killarmy, Sunz of Man, and their immediate affiliates rather than the Clan itself. [[The RZA]] did, in fact, produce the tracks "Wake Up" and "War Face" from ''[[Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars]]''

[[Image:Adaline flow chart.gif|right|thumb|250px|Learning inside a single layer ADALINE]]

'''ADALINE''' ('''Adaptive Linear Neuron''' or later '''Adaptive Linear Element''') is an early single-layer [[artificial neural network]] and the name of the physical device that implemented this network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-l-yim2lNRUC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=adaline+smithsonian+widrow&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k56zCTw0Ah&amp;sig=6lR7UKfSUnTHTCvMJrs8Z8FXr1o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=af0ZUJaNJuThiwKp8oHgBw&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=adaline%20smithsonian%20widrow&amp;f=false |title=Talking Nets: An Oral History of Neural Networks }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEFRtz68m-8 widrowlms: Science in Action]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-isl.stanford.edu/~widrow/papers/t1960anadaptive.pdf 1960: An adaptive "ADALINE" neuron using chemical "memistors"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc2Zj55j1zU widrowlms: The LMS algorithm and ADALINE. Part I - The LMS algorithm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skfNlwEbqck widrowlms: The LMS algorithm and ADALINE. Part II - ADALINE and memistor ADALINE]&lt;/ref&gt; The network uses [[memistor]]s. It was developed by Professor [[Bernard Widrow]] and his graduate student [[Marcian Hoff|Ted Hoff]] at [[Stanford University]] in 1960. It is based on the [[McCulloch–Pitts neuron]]. It consists of a weight, a bias and a summation function.

The difference between Adaline and the standard ([[McCulloch–Pitts neuron|McCulloch–Pitts]]) [[perceptron]] is that in the learning phase, the weights are adjusted according to the weighted sum of the inputs (the net). In the standard perceptron, the net is passed to the activation ([[transfer function|transfer]]) function and the function's output is used for adjusting the weights.

A multilayer network of ADALINE units is known as a '''MADALINE'''.

==Definition==

Adaline is a single layer neural network with multiple nodes where each node accepts multiple inputs and generates one output. Given the following variables:as
* &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the input vector
* &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is the weight vector
* &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of inputs
* &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; some constant
* &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the output of the model

then we find that the output is &lt;math&gt;y=\sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j w_j + \theta&lt;/math&gt;.  If we further assume that
*&lt;math&gt; x_0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;w_0 = \theta&lt;/math&gt;

then the output further reduces to: &lt;math&gt;y=\sum_{j=0}^{n} x_j w_j&lt;/math&gt;

==Learning algorithm==

Let us assume:
*&lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the learning rate (some positive constant)
*&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the output of the model
*&lt;math&gt;o&lt;/math&gt; is the target (desired) output

then the weights are updated as follows &lt;math&gt;w \leftarrow w + \eta(o - y)x&lt;/math&gt;.  The ADALINE converges to the least squares error which is &lt;math&gt;E=(o - y)^2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~bylander/cs4793/learnsc32.pdf |title=Adaline (Adaptive Linear) |work=CS 4793: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks |publisher=Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at San Antonio}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This update rule is in fact the [[stochastic gradient descent]] update for [[linear regression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Avi Pfeffer |title=CS181 Lecture 5 — Perceptrons |url=http://www.seas.harvard.edu/courses/cs181/files/lecture05-notes.pdf |publisher=Harvard University }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MADALINE==
MADALINE (Many ADALINE&lt;ref name="winter"/&gt;) is a three-layer (input, hidden, output), fully connected, feed-forward [[artificial neural network]] architecture for [[statistical classification|classification]] that uses ADALINE units in its hidden and output layers, i.e. its activation function is the [[sign function]].&lt;ref&gt;Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEFRtz68m-8 widrowlms: Science in Action] (Madaline is mentioned at the start and at 8:46)&lt;/ref&gt; The three-layer network uses [[memistor]]s. Three different training algorithms for MADALINE networks, which cannot be learned using [[backpropagation]] because the sign function is not differentiable, have been suggested, called Rule I, Rule II and Rule III. The first of these dates back to 1962 and cannot adapt the weights of the hidden-output connection.&lt;ref name="thirty"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Widrow |first1=Bernard |first2=Michael A. |last2=Lehr |title=30 years of adaptive neural networks: perceptron, madaline, and backpropagation |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=78 |issue=9 |year=1990 |pages=1415–1442 |doi=10.1109/5.58323}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second training algorithm improved on Rule I and was described in 1988.&lt;ref name="winter"&gt;{{Cite conference| doi = 10.1109/ICNN.1988.23872| title = MADALINE RULE II: A training algorithm for neural networks| conference = IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks| pages = 401–408| year = 1988| author1 = Rodney Winter| author2 = Bernard Widrow| url=http://www-isl.stanford.edu/~widrow/papers/c1988madalinerule.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third "Rule" applied to a modified network with [[sigmoid function|sigmoid]] activations instead of signum; it was later found to be equivalent to backpropagation.&lt;ref name="thirty"/&gt;

The Rule II training algorithm is based on a principle called "minimal disturbance". It proceeds by looping over training examples, then for each example, it:
* finds the hidden layer unit (ADALINE classifier) with the lowest confidence in its prediction,
* tentatively flips the sign of the unit,
* accepts or rejects the change based on whether the network's error is reduced,
* stops when the error is zero.

Additionally, when flipping single units' signs does not drive the error to zero for a particular example, the training algorithm starts flipping pairs of units' signs, then triples of units, etc.&lt;ref name="winter"/&gt;

'''Abdas''', (also '''Abda''', '''Abdias''', and '''Audas''') was [[bishop]] of [[Susa]] in [[Iran]]. [[Socrates Scholasticus|Socrates of Constantinople]] calls him "bishop of [[Iran|Persia]]".&lt;ref name=socrates&gt;Socrates Scholasticus, ''Ecclesiastical  history'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.ii.x.viii.html  vii. 8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050118121632/http://ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.ii.x.viii.html |date=2005-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Abdas was born in fourth-century Chaldor to a [[Zoroastrian]] mother, who educated him in matters of virtue. After Abdas reached adulthood, he was ordained a Christian priest, and built up in his hometown a monastery and a school, which grew to have around 60 teachers. Abdas baptized many converts in Chaldor, which caused the magi to arrest him. In prison, Abdas was subjected to humiliations, hunger and pain, but remained a Christian until his release. Abdas became a bishop in Kaskhar ([[Susa]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://catholicsaints.info/saint-abdas-ncd"Saint Abdas”. ''New Catholic Dictionary'', 29 January 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330081514/http://catholicsaints.info/saint-abdas-ncd/ |date=30 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdas was an associate of [[Maruthas of Martyropolis]]. Abdas is supposed to have helped [[Maruthas]] in driving out a demon from King Yezdegerd's son.&lt;ref name=socrates/&gt; However, his impetuosity, put an end to the good relations between the Persian king and the Christian community. Engaged in a dispute with the local [[magi]] in AD 420, Abdas destroyed one of the fire temples of the Zoroastrians. Complaint was made to King [[Yazdegerd I of Persia|Yazdegerd]], who ordered the bishop to restore the building and make good all damage that he had committed. Abdas refused to rebuild a heathen temple at his own expense.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9zgMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA303&amp;lpg=PA303&amp;dq=saint+abdas+of+susa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ekt42WooEX&amp;sig=rV8YZ-11suqnFQCgDk8fQK0g6T4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6xZCz3u7aAhXFxVkKHXvaDkA4HhDoAQgrMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=saint%20abdas%20of%20susa&amp;f=false Stokes, G.T., "Isdigerdes (I)", ''A dictionary of Christian biography, literature, sects and doctrine'', ([[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] &amp; [[Henry Wace (Anglican priest)|Henry Wace,]] eds.); London, John Murray (1882), p. 303.]&lt;/ref&gt; These events soured the relationship between the [[Christian church]] and the Persian government, which had previously been good, and caused a wave of persecution against the [[Christian]]s in Persia.&lt;ref&gt;Theodoret,  [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf203.iv.viii.v.xxxviii.html  v. 39] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050220132416/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf203.iv.viii.v.xxxviii.html |date=2005-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was that orders were issued for the destruction of all churches, and these were carried out by the Zoroastrians, who had regarded with great envy the royal favour extended to Maruthas and his co-religionists. Before long the destruction of churches developed into a general persecution, in which Abdas was one of the first martyrs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11712a.htm Oussani, Gabriel. "Persia." The Catholic Encyclopedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029205344/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11712a.htm |date=2009-10-29 }} Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 17 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

His companions included the priests Hashu and Isaac, the secretary Ephrem, the hypodeacon Papa, the laymen Daduk and Durdan, and Papa, a brother of Abdas himself were also killed. His feast day is 5 September or 16 May&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Abdas - Catholic Online|url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=1067|publisher=Catholic Online|accessdate=2007-09-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031023319/http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=1067|archivedate=2007-10-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Roman Catholic Church, and March 31 in the Syrian church.

{{nihongo|'''Abe no Hirafu'''|{{linktext|阿倍}} {{linktext|比羅夫}}}} was a notable Japanese general of the [[Asuka period]].

==Biography==
Events in his life are accounted in the [[Nihon Shoki]] and [[Kojiki]], both written several decades after his death. His father's name and origin are unknown, as the written sources contradict one another, and may have been altered to glorify the genealogy of then-living clans.

After reaching adulthood, Abe was a governor of [[Koshi Province]]. In 658, he defeated the [[Mishihase]] in "Watarishima" (which may mean [[Tsugaru Peninsula]] or [[Hokkaido]]) at the request of the native inhabitants. His men continued to raid and plunder in [[Hokkaido]] and [[Okushiri Island]] until 660, bringing numerous trophies and prisoners to court. His trophies included at least 2 live bears, 70 bear hides, and 353 prisoners. In March 660, local allies asked for his military assistance at [[Ishikari River]] in [[Hokkaido]], where he was victorious again.

In 662 his lord (soon to become the [[Emperor Tenji]]) assigned him and the captive prince [[Buyeo Pung]] to participate in an expedition to the Korean peninsula to restore the fallen allied kingdom of [[Baekje]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.samurai-archives.com/index.php?title=Abe_no_Hirafu "Abe no Hirafu" from amurai-archives.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Abe was assigned the command of the rear division out of three divisions available. His division was an entirely naval unit. He arrived on the continent in August 662 and was recalled after the defeat in the [[Battle of Baekgang]] in August 663.

''Abe no Hirafu'' might be the ancestor of one or more of the [[Abe clan]]s, as well as the [[Ando clan|Ando]] and [[Akita clan]]s.

The Christian Communities of the Middle East (2009), p.100.&lt;/ref&gt; Abgar's nephew, [[Sanatruk|King Sanatruk]] of Armenia, is also chronicled extensively in Armenian writings.

Abgar V came to power in 4 BC. He became a [[Roman client]], lost his throne in 7 AD and regained it five years later.

Armenian historian [[Movses Khorenatsi]], or Moses of Chorene (ca. 410–490s AD), reported that the chief wife of King Abgar V was Queen [[Helena of Adiabene]], the wife of King [[Monobaz I]] of [[Adiabene]], and thus the kingdoms of Edessa and Adiabene were linked in some manner. [[Robert Eisenman]] suggests Queen Helena as one of the wives of King Abgar V, who allotted her the lands of Adiabene.{{sfn|Eisenman|1992|p=8}} Professor Eisenman derived this association from Movses Khorenatsi mentioning the same famine relief to Judaea as does Flavius Josephus:
{{quote|As to the first of Abgar’s wives, named Helena... She went away to Jerusalem in the time of Claudius, during the famine which Agabus had predicted; with all her treasures she bought in Egypt an immense quantity of corn, which she distributed amongst the poor, a fact to which Josephus testifies. Helena’s tomb, a truly remarkable one, is still to be seen before the gate of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{ws|{{cite book |author=Movses Khorenatsi |chapter=[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume VIII/Memoirs of Edessa And Other Ancient Syriac Documents/Moses of Chorene/Chapter 10|History of Armenia]] |translator-last=Pratten |translator-first=Benjamin Plummer |title=Memoirs of Edessa And Other Ancient Syriac Documents |editor-last1=Roberts |editor-first1=Alexander |editor-last2=Donaldson |editor-first2=James |editor-last3=Coxe |editor-first3=Arthur Cleveland |editor-last4=Schaff |editor-first4=Philip |series=[[Ante-Nicene Fathers]] |volume=Vol. VIII |at=Chapter 10}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Professor Eisenman goes on to equate King Abgarus V with the [[Agabus]] in [[Acts of the Apostles]] (Acts 11:27-30), because Agabus was identified with the same famine relief as Queen Helena. By necessity Eisenman then equates the biblical [[Antioch|Antioch Orontes]] with Antioch Edessa, indicating that [[Paul the Apostle]] and [[Barnabas]] went to Edessa.{{sfn|Eisenman|1992|p=1}}

On August 24, 2009, the board of the [[Central Bank of Armenia]] adopted a decision on introducing a new banknote with a nominal value of [[Armenian dram|AMD]] 100,000. The new banknote depicts King Abgar V, described as King of Armenian Mesopotamia. The front of the banknote depicts Abgar pointing at the royal flag bearing an image of the Mandylion. The reverse of the banknote depicts disciple Thaddeus of Edessa handing the canvas to King Abgar V and his consequent miraculous healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/economy/news/35350/|title=CBA issues 100.000 Dram banknotes|date=24 August 2009|work=PanARMENIAN Network|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian legend==
=== Letter of Abgar to Jesus ===

Abgar V is claimed to be one of the first [[Christian]] kings in history, having been converted to the faith by [[Thaddeus of Edessa]], one of the [[seventy disciples]].{{sfn|Chapman|1913}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2_eAKmK7KkYC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Lesser Eastern Churches |isbn= 978-0-9715986-2-1 |author1=Fortescue |first1=Adrian |date=December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church historian [[Eusebius]] records that the Edessan archives contained a copy of a correspondence exchanged between Abgar of Edessa and Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;In his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Church History]]'', I, xiii, ''ca'' AD 325.&lt;/ref&gt; The correspondence consisted of Abgar's letter and the answer dictated by Jesus. On August 15, 944, the [[Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Istanbul)|Church of St. Mary of Blachernae]] in [[Constantinople]] received the letter and the [[Image of Edessa|Mandylion]]. Both relics were then moved to the [[Church of the Virgin of the Pharos]].&lt;ref name=ja172&gt;{{cite book|last=Janin|first=Raymond|authorlink=Raymond Janin|title=La Géographie ecclésiastique de l'Empire byzantin. 1. Part: Le Siège de Constantinople et le Patriarcat Oecuménique. 3rd Vol. : Les Églises et les Monastères|publisher=Institut Français d'Etudes Byzantines|language=French|location=Paris|year=1953|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Edessa Abgar king with Christ image.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Fresco from Varaga St. Gevorg church chapel showing king Abgar with image of Christ]]
The account of this enjoyed great popularity in the East, and also in the West, during the Middle Ages: Jesus' letter was copied on parchment, inscribed in marble and metal, and used as a talisman or an amulet. Of this correspondence, there survive not only a Syriac text, but an Armenian translation as well, two independent Greek versions, shorter than the Syriac, and several inscriptions on stone.

A curious growth has arisen from this event, with scholars disputing whether Abgar suffered from gout or from leprosy, whether the correspondence was on parchment or papyrus, and so forth.

The text of the letter was:
{{quote|Abgar, ruler of Edessa, to Jesus the good physician who has appeared in the country of Jerusalem, greeting. I have heard the reports of you and of your cures as performed by you without medicines or herbs. For it is said that you make the blind to see and the lame to walk, that you cleanse lepers and cast out impure spirits and demons, and that you heal those afflicted with lingering disease, and raise the dead. And having heard all these things concerning you, I have concluded that one of two things must be true: either you are God, and having come down from heaven you do these things, or else you, who does these things, are the son of God. I have therefore written to you to ask you if you would take the trouble to come to me and heal all the ill which I suffer. For I have heard that the Jews are murmuring against you and are plotting to injure you. But I have a very small yet noble city which is great enough for us both.&lt;ref name="Leclercq"/&gt;}}

Jesus gave the messenger the reply to return to Abgar:
{{quote|Blessed are you who hast believed in me without having seen me. For it is written concerning me, that they who have seen me will not believe in me, and that they who have not seen me will believe and be saved. But in regard to what you have written me, that I should come to you, it is necessary for me to fulfill all things here for which I have been sent, and after I have fulfilled them thus to be taken up again to him that sent me. But after I have been taken up I will send to you one of my disciples, that he may heal your disease and give life to you and yours.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250101.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]] wrote of the letter in her account of her pilgrimage in Edessa. She read the letter during her stay, and remarked that the copy in Edessa was fuller than the copies in her home (which was likely France).&lt;ref name="Egeria"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bernard|first1=John|title=The Pilgrimage of Egeria|url=http://www.digital.library.upenn.edu/women/egeria/pilgrimage/pilgrimage.html|website=University of Pennsylvania|publisher=Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the importance it attained in the apocryphal cycle, the correspondence of King Abgar also gained a place in liturgy for some time. The Syriac liturgies commemorate the correspondence of Abgar during Lent. The Celtic liturgy appears to have attached importance to it; the ''[[Liber Hymnorum]]'', a manuscript preserved at Trinity College, Dublin (E. 4, 2), gives two collects on the lines of the letter to Abgar. It is even possible that this letter, followed by various prayers, may have formed a minor liturgical office in some Catholic churches.&lt;ref name="Leclercq"&gt;{{Cite CE1913 |last=Leclercq |first=Henri |wstitle=The Legend of Abgar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This event has played an important part in the self-definition of several Eastern churches. Abgar is counted as saint, with feasts on May 11 and October 28 in the Eastern Orthodox Church, August 1 in the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syrian Church]], and daily in the Mass of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. The Armenian Apostolic Church in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], is named after Saint Abgar (also spelled as Apkar).

=== Critical scholarship ===
The scholar [[Bart D. Ehrman]] cites evidence from Han Drijvers and others for regarding the whole correspondence as forged in the third century by orthodox Christians "as an anti-Manichaean polemic", and entirely spurious.&lt;ref&gt;''Forgery and Counterforgery'', pp455-458&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of contemporary scholars have suggested origins of the tradition of Abgar's conversion apart from historical record. S. K. Ross suggests the story of Abgar is in the genre of a [[genealogy|genealogical]] [[myth]] which traces the origin of a community back to a mythical or divine ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;S.K. Ross, Roman Edessa. Politics and Culture in the Eastern Fringe of the Roman Empire, Routledge, London 2001, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Crawford Burkitt|F. C. Burkitt]] argues that the conversion of Edessa at the time of [[Abgar VIII]] was retrojected upon the Apostolic age.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Crawford Burkitt|Burkitt, F. C.]], Early Eastern Christianity, John Murray, London 1904, chap. I&lt;/ref&gt; William Adler suggests the origin of the story of the conversion of Abgar V was an invention of an [[antiquarian]] researcher employed by Abgar VIII, who had recently converted to Christianity, in an effort to securely root Christianity in the history of the city.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{cite book |last=Adler |first=William |chapter=Christians and the Public Archive |editor-last=Mason |editor-first=E.F. |title=A Teacher for All Generations: Essays in Honor of James C.

Significant advances in scholarship on the topic have been made{{sfn|Camplani|2009|p=253}} by Desreumaux's translation with commentary,&lt;ref&gt;Histoire du roi Abgar et de Jésus, Présentation et traduction du texte syriaque intégral de la Doctrine d’Addaï par.

The Hakluyt Society, 1901&lt;/ref&gt; Six years earlier, King [[Diogo I of Kongo|Diogo]] had cut off all relations with Portugal and expelled them from the kingdom. The Portuguese attempted to return by plotting with another claimant for the throne to assassinate the king. Shortly after Afonso II took the throne, [[Bernardo I of Kongo|Bernardo I]] murdered him and took the throne. The plot backfired for the Portuguese, however; and all were driven out or killed by popular riots that same year.&lt;ref name="Battell page 136"/&gt;

'''Omo n'Oba n'Edo Uku Akpolokpolo, Akenzua II''' (January 7, 1899–June 11, 1978) was the [[Oba of Benin]] (traditional leader of the [[Edo people]], in [[Nigeria]]) from 1933 until his death in 1978. 

Akenzua II was enthroned as Oba of Benin in April 1933 following the death of his father, [[Eweka II]] (r.1914 – 1933) in February that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=AFRICA|journal=The Crisis|date=July 1933|volume=40|issue=7|pages=159|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-1cEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=oba+benin#v=onepage&amp;q=oba%20benin&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 March 2017|author1=The Crisis Publishing Company|first1=Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oba Akenzua II was dedicated to the provision of western education for his subjects, the Edo people.&lt;ref name=daily&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, he began the movement to return to [[Nigeria]] the [[Benin Bronzes]] looted from the royal compounds and [[Benin ancestral altars|ancestral altars]] in the [[punitive expedition|punitive]] [[Benin Expedition of 1897]]. During his reign, only two of the 3,000 royal court bronzes were returned. However, two coral crowns and coral bead garment, thought to have belonged to [[Ovonramwen]], were returned to him in the late 1930s by G.M. Miller a son of a member of the Benin expedition, who had loaned the pieces to the British Museum in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ELdTDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Cultural Property and Contested Ownership: The Trafficking of Artefacts and the Quest for Restitution|last=Plankensteiner|first=Barbara|date=|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781317281832|editor-last=Hauser-Schäublin|editor-first=Brigitta|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=The Benin Treasures: difficult legacy and contested heritage|editor-last2=Prott|editor-first2=Lyndel V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oba Akenzua II died on June 11, 1978, when he was succeeded by his son, then Prince Solomon, who took on the title of Oba [[Erediauwa]] and duties as the traditional leader of the Edo people in [[Benin City]], [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edo-nation.net/osawe1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Code stylometry''' (also known as '''program authorship attribution''' or '''source code authorship analysis''') is the application of [[stylometry]] to computer code to attribute authorship to anonymous [[Binary code|binary]] or [[source code]]. It often involves breaking down and examining the distinctive patterns and characteristics of the programming code and then comparing them to computer code whose authorship is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/03/16/identifying_anonymous_programmers/|title=FYI: AI tools can unmask anonymous coders from their binary executables|last=Claburn|first=Thomas|date=March 16, 2018|work=The Register|access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[software forensics]], code stylometry attributes authorship for purposes other than [[intellectual property infringement]], including [[plagiarism detection]], copyright investigation, and authorship verification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usenix.org/node/190845|title=De-anonymizing Programmers via Code Stylometry|last=|first=|date=August 12, 2015|website=USENIX|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1989, researchers Paul Oman and Curtis Cook identified the authorship of 18 different [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] programs written by six authors by using “markers” based on [[Typography|typographic]] characteristics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frantzeskou|first=Georgia|last2=Stamatatos|first2=Efstathios|last3=Gritzalis|first3=Stefanos|date=October 2005|title=Supporting the Cybercrime Investigation Process: Effective Discrimination of Source Code Authors Based on Byte-Level Information|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220917906_Supporting_the_Cybercrime_Investigation_Process_Effective_Discrimination_of_Source_Code_Authors_Based_on_Byte-Level_Information|journal=E-business and Telecommunication Networks|volume=|pages=283-290|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-75993-5_14|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, researchers Stephen MacDonell, Andrew Gray, and Philip Sallis developed a dictionary-based author attribution system called IDENTIFIED (Integrated Dictionary-based Extraction of Non-language-dependent Token Information for Forensic Identification, Examination, and Discrimination) that determined the authorship of source code in computer programs written in [[C++]]. The researchers noted that authorship can be identified using degrees if flexibility in the writing style of the source code, such as:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Andrew|last2=MacDonnell|first2=Stephen|last3=Sallis|first3=Philip|date=January 1998|title=IDENTIFIED (Integrated Dictionary-based Extraction of Non-language-dependent Token Information for Forensic Identification, Examination, and Discrimination): a dictionary-based system for extracting source code metrics for software forensics|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/215632771_IDENTIFIED_Integrated_Dictionary-based_Extraction_of_Non-language-dependent_Token_Information_for_Forensic_Identification_Examination_and_Discrimination_a_dictionary-based_system_for_extracting_source|journal=Proceedings of Software Engineering: Education &amp; Practice|volume=|pages=252-259|doi=10.1109/SEEP.1998.707658|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The way the algorithm in the source code solves the given problem
* The way the source code is laid out (spacing, indentation, bordering characteristics, standard headings, etc.)
* The way the algorithm is implemented in the source code

The IDENTIFIED system attributed authorship by first merging all the relevant files to produce a single source code file and then subjecting it to a metrics analysis by counting the number of occurrences for each metric. In addition, the system was language-independent due to its ability to create new dictionary files and meta-dictionaries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1999, a team of researchers led by Stephen MacDonell tested the performance of three different program authorship discrimination techniques on 351 programs written in C++ by 7 different authors. The researchers compared the effectiveness of using a [[Feedforward neural network|feed-forward neural network (FFNN)]] that was trained on a [[Backpropagation|back-propagation]] algorithm, [[Multiple discriminant analysis|multiple discriminant analysis (MDA)]], and [[Case-based reasoning|case-based reasoning (CBR)]]. At the end of the experiment, both the neural network and the MDA had an accuracy rate of 81.1%, while the CBR reached an accuracy performance of 88.0%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacDonell|first=Stephen|last2=Gray|first2=Andrew|last3=MacLennan|first3=Grant|last4=Sallis|first4=Philip|date=February 1999|title=Software forensics for discriminating between program authors using case-based reasoning, feedforward neural networks and multiple discriminant analysis|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3848588_Software_forensics_for_discriminating_between_program_authors_using_case-based_reasoning_feedforward_neural_networks_and_multiple_discriminant_analysis|journal=Neural Information Processing|volume=1|pages=|issn=1177-455X|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, researchers from the Laboratory of Information and Communication Systems Security at [[Aegean University]] introduced a language-independent method of program authorship attribution where they used [[byte]]-level [[N-gram|n-grams]] to classify a program to an author. This technique scanned the files and then created a table of different n-grams found in the source code and the number of times they appear. In addition, the system could operate with limited numbers of training examples from each author. However, the more source code programs that were present for each author, the more reliable the author attribution. In an experiment testing their approach, the researchers found that classification using n-grams reached an accuracy rate of up to 100%, although the rate declined drastically if the profile size exceeded 500 and the n-gram size was 3 or less.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2011, researchers from the University of Wisconsin created a program authorship attribution system that identified a programmer based on the binary code of a program instead of the source code. The researchers utilized [[machine learning]] and training code to determine which characteristics of the code would be helpful in describing the programming style. In an experiment testing the approach on a set of programs written by 10 different authors, the system achieved an accuracy rate of 81%. When tested using a set of programs written by almost 200 different authors, the system performed with an accuracy rate of 51%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenblum|first=Nathan|last2=Zhu|first2=Xiaojin|last3=Miller|first3=Barton|date=September 2011|title=Who wrote this code?

In 2015, a team of postdoctoral researchers from [[Princeton University]], [[Drexel University]], the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], and the [[University of Göttingen|University of Goettingen]] as well as researchers from the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] developed a program authorship attribution system that could determine the author of a program from a sample pool with programs written by 1,600 coders with a 94 percent accuracy. The methodology consisted of four steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.army.mil/article/160976/Malicious_coders_will_lose_anonymity_as_identity_finding_research_matures/|title=Malicious coders will lose anonymity as identity-finding research matures|last=Brayboy|first=Joyce|date=January 15, 2016|work=U.S. Army|access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Disassembly''' - The program is disassembled to obtain information on its characteristics.
# '''Decompilation''' - The program is converted into a variant of C-like [[pseudocode]] through [[decompilation]] to obtain [[abstract syntax tree]]s.
# '''Dimensionality reduction''' - The most relevant and useful features for author identification are selected.
# '''Classification''' - A random-forest classifier attributes the authorship of the program.

This approach analyzed various characteristics of the code, such as blank space, the use of tabs and spaces, and the names of variables, and then used a method of evaluation called a syntax tree analysis that translated the sample code into tree-like diagrams that displayed the structural decisions involved in writing the code. The design of these diagrams prioritized the order of the commands and the depths of the functions that were nestled in the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forensicmag.com/news/2015/02/dusting-cyber-fingerprints-coding-style-identifies-anonymous-programmers|title=Dusting for Cyber Fingerprints: Coding Style Identifies Anonymous Programmers|last=Greenstadt|first=Rachel|date=February 27, 2015|work=Forensic Magazine|access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{homicide}}

'''Contract killing''' is a form of [[murder]] in which one party hires another party (often called a '''hitman''') to kill a target individual or group of people. It involves an [[illegal agreement]] between two or more parties in which one party agrees to kill the target in exchange for some form of payment, monetary or otherwise. Either party may be a person, group, or an organization. In the United States, the crime is punishable by 15 years to life in a state penitentiary. Contract killing has been associated with [[organized crime]], [[Conspiracy theory|government conspiracies]], and [[feud|vendetta]]s. For example, in the United States, the gang [[Murder, Inc.]] committed hundreds of murders on behalf of the [[National Crime Syndicate]] during the 1930s and 1940s.

Contract killing provides the hiring party with the advantage of not having to commit the actual killing, making it more difficult for [[law enforcement]] to connect said party with the murder. The likelihood that authorities will establish that party's guilt for the committed crime, especially due to lack of [[forensic evidence]] linked to the contracting party, makes the case more difficult to attribute to the hiring party.

==Statistics==
A study by the [[Australian Institute of Criminology]] of 162 attempted or actual contract murders in Australia between 1989 and 2002 indicated that the most common reason for murder-for-hire was insurance policies payouts. The study also found that the average payment for a "hit" was $15,000 with variation from $5,000 up to $30,000 and that the most commonly used weapons were [[firearms]]. Contract killings accounted for 2% of murders in Australia during that time period.&lt;ref name="lovers"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/02/05/australia.killings.offbeat.reut/index.html|title=Lovers top contract killing hit list |date=February 5, 2004|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Contract killings also make up a relatively similar percentage of all killings elsewhere. For example, they made up about 5% of all murders in [[Scotland]] from 1993 to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2003/11/18570/29572|title=Homicide in Scotland, 2002|publisher=Government of Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3990">'''Dalva de Oliveira''' or '''Vicentina de Paula Oliveira''' (May 5, 1917 &amp;ndash; August 31, 1972) was a Brazilian singer and one of "divas" of the "Radio Era."&lt;ref name="As rainhas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hupfer|first=Maria Luisa Rinaldi|title=As rainhas do rádio: símbolos da nascente indústria cultural brasileira|year=2009|publisher=Senac Editoras|location=São Paulo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her greatest hits included ''Segredo'' (Secret) (1947), ''Tudo acabado'' (It's All Over) (1950), ''Ave Maria'' (1950), and ''Teus olhos verdes'' (Your Green Eyes) (1961). In addition, she recorded frequently with her son [[Pery Ribeiro]], from her marriage with composer [[Herivelto Martins]]. She died as a victim of [[internal bleeding]], probably caused by cancer.

==Life and career==
Dalva was born in  [[Rio Claro, São Paulo]], Brazil.  Her father was a carpenter and semi-professional musician, playing clarinet and saxophone with a group called Os Oito Batutas (the Eight Batons).  He died when Dalva was just eight years old, and, as a result, Dalva and her three sisters were placed into an orphanage, where Dalva remained for three years.  At the orphanage, Dalva learned to play piano and organ, as well as choral singing.  Dalva left the orphanage due to an illness, and went to live with her mother in the city of São Paulo.&lt;ref name=Silva&gt;{{cite book|last=Silva|first=Walter|title=Eu vou te contar|year=2002|publisher=Editores Associados Ltda. / Editora Codex|location=São Paulo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, while still a teenager, Dalva began working as a singer, touring (together with her mother) with a group led by Antônio Zovetti.&lt;ref name=Silva /&gt;  Thereafter, Dalva spent a year as a regularly featured singer on Rádio Mineira in the state of [[Minas Gerais]].  Hoping to achieve success on a larger stage, Dalva and her mother moved to [[Rio de Janeiro]].  At first, Dalva had to work in a factory, while her mother worked as a cleaning woman.  In 1936, however, she was hired by [[Rádio Mayrink Veiga]], the most powerful broadcaster in Rio at that time.&lt;ref name="As rainhas" /&gt;

Dalva began working with [[Herivelto Martins]] and Francisco Sena, whose singing duo ''Preto e Branco'' (Black and White) was already popular.  In 1936, Dalva and Herivelto married.  The three renamed the group ''Trio de Ouro'' (Golden Trio).  The trio performed and recorded together until 1948.  In 1949, Dalva separated from Herivelto.  The couple's separation and divorce was prolonged, bitter, and public.  Their dispute and mutual accusations were featured not only in press coverage, but in the lyrics of songs recorded by each of them.&lt;ref name="As rainhas" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Silva /&gt; When she left Herivelto, one part of the public viewed Dalva as a fallen woman; another part, as a rebel and hero.  Dalva was quoted as saying: "I had everything: a home, husband, children, career, and I left that security in order to gain my freedom, to regain myself as a woman."  Author Maria Hupfer wrote of her: "Dalva became the idol of the prostitutes, mistresses, and homosexuals, and was excoriated by housewives and family men."&lt;ref name="As rainhas" /&gt;

The former [[President of Cuba|President]] and [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba]], [[Fidel Castro]] died of [[natural causes]] at 22:29 ([[Cuba Time|CST]]) in the evening of 25 November 2016. His brother, the then-President and current First Secretary [[Raúl Castro]], made an announcement about his death on state television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-38114953|title=Cuba's Fidel Castro, former president, dies aged 90|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most foreign government officials, most notably in Latin America, Africa, and South Asia, praised Castro for improving healthcare and education for Cuba's rural poor, opposing international racism, and standing up to US hegemony in the Western Hemisphere while others, especially in the US, Europe, and Canada were more critical of his legacy, bashing him as an evil tyrant who drove the Cuban economy to the ground and quashed all opposition to his rule. Some officials gave more neutral condolences while others issued statements about positive [[Foreign relations of Cuba|binational relations with Cuba]] (South Africa, Namibia, and Angola praised Castro for ending apartheid in South Africa and freeing Namibia in order to reinforce Mandela's common cause with Castro in fighting racism). Castro's body was cremated and his ashes were interred in [[Santiago de Cuba]] on 4 December 2016, and hundreds of thousands of Cubans commemorated the event.

==Background==
[[File:Fidel 90 años DSC01814 (38335422541).jpg|thumb|Graffiti in Havana commemorating Castro's 90th birthday]]
In April 2016, Castro told the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party]]: "I'll be 90 years old soon. Soon, I'll be like all the others. The time will come for all of us, but the ideas of the Cuban communists will remain as proof on this planet that if they are worked at with fervour and dignity, they can produce the material and cultural goods that human beings need, and we need to fight without truce to obtain them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/19/fidel-castro-farewell-speech-cuba-communist-congress|title=Fidel Castro bids farewell to Cuba's Communist party congress|first=Rory|last=Carroll|date=19 April 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, his older brother [[Ramón Castro Ruz|Ramón]] died at the age of 91.

Castro's death was expected in [[South Florida]], with media and governments expecting and hoping that it would cause chaotic celebrations and [[regime change]] plans. The city of Miami had planned to open the [[Orange Bowl Stadium]] for celebrations; schools might have dismissed early; and police and government officials might have blocked boat piers to prevent [[Cuban exile]]s from trying to invade the island. The ''[[Miami Herald]]'' created a "Cuba plan" more than 20 years before Castro's death; as much as 60 pages in length, it included multiple [[newspaper extra]]s and reporters joining the [[United States Coast Guard]] as it handled the expected large number of refugees fleeing the island. Its journalists prepared to surreptitiously enter Cuba; employees knew that Castro's death would interrupt any vacation or weekend. After Raúl Castro became the country's leader and visiting Cuba became easier, such plans became less important.&lt;ref name="nesmith20150115"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cjr.org/local_news/fidel_castros_death_news.php |title=Preparing for Fidel Castro's Death |last=Nesmith |first=Susannah |date=15 January 2015 |work=Columbia Journalism Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tompkins20161126"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poynter.org/2016/years-of-planning-pay-off-for-cnn-and-miami-herald-coverage-of-castros-death/440265/ |title=Years of planning pay off for CNN and Miami Herald's coverage of Castro's death |date=26 November 2016 | last=Tompkins |first=Al |website=Poynter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gonzalez20161126"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/from-the-editor/article117284483.html |title=Behind the scenes: How the Miami Herald’s ‘Cuba Plan’ became a reality |last=Gonzalez |first=Aminda Marqués |date=26 November 2016 |newspaper=The Miami Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Castro's death, his brother [[Raúl Castro]] announced: "According to the will expressed by comrade Fidel, his body will be [[Cremation|cremated]] in the early hours" of 26 November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/368238-fidel-castro-dies-90/|title=Fidel Castro, Cuba's longtime leader, dies at 90|publisher=RT}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cremation was a private affair, with only state and party officials attending together with Fidel's family and friends.

On 3 December at 19:00, another mass gathering took place at Plaza Antonio Maceo in Santiago de Cuba and Raul and other foreign leaders and dignitaries People waved the [[flag of Cuba]] and sang the national anthem. Raul Castro said in a final speech that Castro showed it was "possible to firmly maintain the inalienable principles of our sovereignty without fear to the nuclear blackmail of the United States during those days of the missile crisis in October 1962." He further added that in Castro's images and statues will not be displayed in public places and roads will not be named after him.

*{{flagu|United Kingdom}} – Foreign Secretary [[Boris Johnson]] wrote: "Fidel #Castro's death marks the end of an era for #Cuba &amp; the start of a new one for Cuba's people."&lt;ref name="guard"/&gt; The Foreign Office echoed Johnson's statement and also issued a statement that read: "The UK expresses its condolences to the government and people of Cuba, and to the former president’s family...Fidel Castro’s leadership of the 1959 Cuban Revolution marked him out as an historic if controversial figure. The UK will continue to work with the government of Cuba on a wide range of foreign policy priorities, including on human rights.&lt;ref name="guard"/&gt;
**[[Leader of the Opposition]] [[Jeremy Corbyn]] called Castro "a massive figure in the history of the whole planet." He also praised Castro's "heroism" and commended the "social changes" to Cuba.

**{{flagu|Scotland}} – National Secretary of the [[Scottish Socialist Party]] [[Bill Bonnar]] wrote: "Castro’s entire political life was given to the struggle for Cuban independence and the struggle for liberation and socialism all over the world. He may have died but his legacy will live and endure – because heroes live forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scottishsocialistparty.org/fidel-castro-90-year-cuban-legacy/|title=Fidel Castro: a 90 year Cuban legacy|date=27 November 2016|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Former Trade Minister [[Brian Wilson (Labour politician)|Brian Wilson]] said of Castro that he had sent out a "beacon of hope" to Latin America. "He educated his people and he gave them healthcare they had never had before, and you can admire all of that without being an uncritical supporter, believe me, but do not lose the bigger picture – that Fidel Castro, for his region and for oppressed people throughout the world, sent out a message of hope. He recalled to ''[[BBC Radio 4]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''Today'' of having met Castro on a trade mission: "He proposed a toast to Tony Blair and the [[third way]], I proposed a toast to peace and socialism." Former cabinet minister and leader of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Peter Hain]] said: "Although responsible for indefensible human rights and free speech abuses, Castro created a society of unparalleled access to free health, education and equal opportunity despite an economically throttling U.S.A. siege. His troops inflicted the first defeat on South Africa’s troops in Angola in 1988, a vital turning point in the struggle against apartheid." Former London Mayor [[Ken Livingstone]] called Castro an "absolute giant of the 20th century." He also told ''Today'': "I'm sure they will, over time, move towards something like a traditional west European democracy. It could have happened a lot earlier if you hadn't had, the entire time, a blockade by America, attempts to overthrow the regime, eight assassination attempts authorised by American presidents." He further commented that "even if [[Donald Trump|Trump]] goes a little bit bonkers.... Of course Fidel did things that were wrong.... Initially he wasn't very good on [[LGBT rights in Cuba|lesbian and gay rights]], but the key things that mattered was that people had a good education, good healthcare and wealth was evenly distributed. He was not living as a billionaire laundering money off into a Panamanian bank account or anything like that, he was good for the people."&lt;ref name="guard"/&gt;

*{{flagu|Australia}} – Prime Minister [[Malcolm Turnbull]] declined to make a formal statement. Speaking instead for the government, [[frontbench]] Senator [[Mathias Cormann]] described Fidel Castro as a "significant but controversial figure." He added: "The policies and actions he pursued, in our judgment, weren't in the best interests of the Cuban people. Certainly his hostility towards the West, in particular the United States, we believe imposed significant hardship on the Cuban people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/dont-celebrate-castro-legacy-abbott/news-story/448365b4dfb99b613509bd653a996f22|title=PM keeps his view of Castro to himself|date=27 November 2016|work=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flagu|New Zealand}} – Prime Minister [[John Key]] issued no formal statement, but responded informally to media queries by saying: "There's no question he repressed a lot of people and was a very polarising figure, and you can see those people that have been exiles living in Miami fundamentally rejoicing the fact that the guy has passed away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/world/fidel-castros-death-leaves-cuba-reeling-2016112806|title=Fidel Castro's death leaves Cuba reeling|publisher=|accessdate=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flagu|Papua New Guinea}} – Prime Minister [[Peter O'Neill]], who had completed a [[state visit]] to Cuba just hours before Fidel Castro's death, said: "Regardless of the politics of the time, such as the Cold War in relation to Cuba, […] when a warrior passes it is time to pay homage to the person who stood by their convictions. The legacy that Fidel Castro leaves for the world is far-reaching. Outside the politics, Fidel Castro pioneered the development of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services in his country and [[Cuban medical internationalism|these are being extended around the world]].

Nobel Peace Prize laureate [[Adolfo Pérez Esquivel]] said: "From the roots of Our America Fidel left for eternity. Liberator, apostle, humanist, friend…"&lt;ref name="cu"/&gt; His fellow Nobel laureate [[Rigoberta Menchú]] said: "Our revolution is humanist because it humanises man."&lt;ref name="cu"/&gt; Former Argentine footballer Diego Maradona stated that Castro was a "great" man and that, while he was away for the [[2016 Davis Cup]] in Croatia: "[t]hey called me from [[Buenos Aires]] and it was a shock. I'm terribly sad as he was like a second father."&lt;ref name="guard"/&gt;

Minoru Hataguchi, who led Castro through the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum]] as its director, said Castro sympathised with the ordeal of ''[[hibakusha]]''. He quoted Castro as having said: "Che Guevara told me to go to Hiroshima. I’m glad I came." He added that Castro "sympathised with the people of Hiroshima and his death is unfortunate." He further noted that Castro's questions "showed his character, that he was trying to understand the agonies of the ''hibakusha''." Masakazu Masukawa, another ''hibakusha'' who had met Castro during a visit to Cuba in 2012 recalled that Castro "was a person of influence. If he had called on the world to abandon nuclear weapons early on, momentum might have grown bigger."&lt;ref name="jt"/&gt;

Chairman of the [[Human Rights Foundation]] [[Garry Kasparov]] wrote: "Fidel Castro was one of the 20th century's many monsters. We should lament only that he had so long to inflict misery on Cuba and beyond." [[Amnesty International]]'s Americas Director [[Erika Guevara Rosas|Erika Guevara-Rosas]] issued a statement that described Castro as a "progressive but deeply flawed leader." It cited: "Access to public services such as health and education for Cubans were substantially improved by the Cuban revolution and for this, his leadership must be applauded. However, despite these achievements in areas of social policy, Fidel Castro’s 49-year reign was characterised by a ruthless suppression of freedom of expression... Fidel Castro’s legacy is a tale of two worlds. The question now is what human rights will look like in a future Cuba. The lives of many depend on it."&lt;ref name="guard"/&gt;

'''P. Donald "Don" Kemp'''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&amp;dat=19840412&amp;id=E6ldAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1204,1824272|title=Observer-Reporter – Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1947 – ca. November 16, 1982) was an advertising executive from [[New York City|New York]] who disappeared in mysterious circumstances in a remote part of [[Wyoming]] in 1982. He remained missing until his remains were discovered in 1986, a short distance from where his car was found abandoned four years previously.

== Background ==
Kemp was working in [[advertising]] on [[Madison Avenue]] in New York City when a traffic accident left him with debilitating injuries that took him several years to recover from. He decided to leave the [[rat race]] and embark on a fresh start in a mountain cabin in the [[Jackson Hole]] valley in Wyoming.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trailwentcold.com/2016/06/08/the-trail-went-cold-episode-9-don-kemp/|title=The Trail Went Cold – Episode 9 – Don Kemp|last=Gill|date=2016-06-08|website=The Trail Went Cold|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Last known movements ==
Kemp left New York in September 1982 and drove to Wyoming in his [[Chevrolet Blazer]]. On November 15, 1982, the day before he disappeared, he visited a museum in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]], where he stayed for around two hours and did not speak to anyone. Upon leaving the museum, he left behind his [[briefcase]], which contained his diaries, address book, [[Traveler's cheque|traveler's checks]] and glasses needed for driving.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Vehicle discovered ==
On the morning of November 16, 1982, Kemp's car was found abandoned with its engine still running, on a ramp off the [[Interstate 80 in Wyoming|I-80]], 40 miles from the nearest town.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://coolinterestingstuff.com/the-strange-mysterious-death-of-don-kemp|title=The Strange Mysterious Death Of Don Kemp {{!}} Strange Unexplained Mysteries|website=coolinterestingstuff.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car was so full of belongings that there would have been no space for anyone except the driver.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A single pair of footprints in the snow led investigators six miles into the wilderness to a barn, where they found a pile of sticks arranged to start a fire, and three of Kemp's socks. There were no footprints leading away from the barn, but Kemp was nowhere to be found. Nearby, investigators found a duffel bag containing laundry soap, clothes and a teapot, all of which belonged to Kemp.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Due to the solitary set of footprints, the lack of space for anyone else in the car, and the featureless terrain which should have enabled searchers to easily spot a human being, investigators believed from the outset that Kemp had either disappeared of his own volition and did not want to be found, or was mentally unstable. Deputy Rod Johnson stated: “I felt the guy was disorientated, and I felt that he didn’t want to be found. If he would’ve wanted to be found, he would have heard the aircraft, could have waved his arms, got our attention, gone up to a ridge, anywhere, and been sighted.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Three days after Kemp's disappearance, there was a blizzard and the search was called off. Everyone involved in the search agreed that if Kemp was in the area and not already dead, he would have died in the blizzard.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unsolved.com/archives/don-kemp|title=Don Kemp {{!}} Unsolved more Mysteries|website=unsolved.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mysterious phone calls ==
Several months after Kemp disappeared, Judy Aiello, a close friend of his from New York, returned home from an extended vacation to find six messages on her answering machine featuring a voice that she was certain was Kemp's, although the caller never stated their name.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The caller sounded panicked and read out a number, urging Aiello to call him back. She did so the next day: a man answered and Aiello asked if Don was there. The man replied "Yes," then almost immediately said, "No". Aiello asked the man if he could ask Don to call her back; the man replied "Yeah" and hung up.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Aiello never received a call back.

Aiello informed Kemp's mother, Mary, who in turn informed the authorities. They traced the calls to a rented trailer in [[Casper, Wyoming|Casper]], Wyoming, occupied by a man named Mark Dennis. Dennis denied making the calls and of ever having met Don Kemp. He suggested that either someone else used his telephone without his knowledge, or that the telephone company made a mistake about the number used to call Aiello. He agreed to a polygraph test and the authorities described him as cooperative and were satisfied that he was not involved in Kemp's disappearance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Mary Kemp disagreed with the police's opinion on Dennis and traveled to Wyoming to question him herself. Dennis refused to speak to Mary Kemp and hired an attorney, before abruptly moving away from Casper three weeks after he was initially questioned by the police.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Remains discovered ==
Kemp's decomposed remains were discovered in 1985 by hunters a few miles from where his car was found. The autopsy showed no signs of foul play, and the authorities are satisfied that he walked into the wilderness voluntarily and died in or before the [[blizzard]] in the immediate aftermath.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, it remains a mystery as to how Kemp's body was not found during the initial search, as his body was located in a clearly visible place that had already been searched.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mysteriousuniverse.org/2017/06/the-very-weird-vanishing-and-death-of-don-kemp/|title=The Very Weird Vanishing and Death of Don Kemp {{!}} Mysterious Universe|website=mysteriousuniverse.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sightings and other theories ==
Mary Kemp never accepted the findings and claimed up until her death in 2014 that her son was murdered by Mark Dennis.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The telephone calls remain a mystery, as Judy Aiello's number was [[Unlisted number|unlisted]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Theories on online forums have surmised that someone found Kemp's address book that he had left at the museum in Cheyenne, and phoned Aiello as a [[Prank call|prank]], while others have suggested that Kemp may have been abducted upon leaving the museum, explaining why Aiello was convinced that it was Kemp's voice on the voicemail messages.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In addition, two separate sightings of Kemp were reported in Casper in the months following the believed time of his death. One sighting was at an Abraham Lincoln exhibition and the other was at a bar.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Online enthusiasts have theorised that Kemp may have been targeted in relation to his research on Abraham Lincoln, believing that he discovered something about Lincoln that would have caused shockwaves and was consequently silenced. In the years following Kemp's death, some of his research notes were stolen, and several of the people who came into possession of these notes died in suspicious circumstances.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Media coverage ==
Kemp's case was covered in the first-ever episode of long-running investigative show ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' in January 1987.

The case was covered in a June 2016 episode of true-crime podcast ''The Trail Went Cold''.

'''Feng Zhang''' ({{zh|s=张锋|p=Zhāng Fēng}}; born October 22, 1981) is a Chinese-American biochemist. Zhang currently holds the James and Patricia Poitras Professorship in Neuroscience at the [[McGovern Institute for Brain Research]] and in the departments of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and [[Biological Engineering]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He also has appointment with the [[Broad Institute]] of MIT and Harvard (where he is a core member). He is most well known for his central role in the development of [[optogenetics]] and [[CRISPR]] technologies.

==Early life and education==
Zhang was born in [[China]] in 1982 and given the name 锋 (which means "point of a spear; edge of a tool; vanguard"). Both of his parents were computer programmers in China. At age 11, he moved to [[Iowa]] with his mother (his father was not able to join them for several years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.statnews.com/2015/11/06/hollywood-inspired-scientist-rewrite-code-life/ |title=Meet one of the world’s most groundbreaking scientists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15597">{{short description|Speculative fifth fundamental force force}}
In physics, there are four conventionally accepted [[fundamental force]]s or interactions that form the basis of all known interactions in nature: [[gravity|gravitational]], [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], [[strong interaction|strong nuclear]], and [[weak interaction|weak nuclear]] forces.
Some speculative theories have proposed a '''fifth force''' to explain various anomalous observations that do not fit existing theories.  The characteristics of this fifth force depend on the theory being advanced. Many postulate a force roughly the strength of [[gravity]] (i.e. it is much weaker than [[electromagnetism]] or the [[strong nuclear force|nuclear forces]]) with a range of anywhere from less than a millimeter to cosmological scales. Another proposal is a new weak force, mediated by [[W' and Z' bosons]].

The search for a fifth force has increased in recent decades due to two discoveries in [[cosmology]] which are not explained by current theories.   It has been discovered that most of the mass of the universe is accounted for by an unknown form of matter called [[dark matter]]. Most physicists believe that dark matter is some new undiscovered subatomic particle, but some believe that it could be related to an unknown fundamental force.  Second, it has also recently been discovered that the [[expansion of the universe]] is accelerating, which has been attributed to a form of energy called [[dark energy]].  Some physicists speculate that a form of dark energy called [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] could be a fifth force.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~wetterich/DEBarcelona0706.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cds.cern.ch/record/515241/files/0108217.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1203.6655|last1 = Cicoli|first1 = Michele|title = Natural Quintessence in String Theory|journal = Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics|volume = 2012|issue = 7|pages = 044|last2 = Pedro|first2 = Francisco G.|last3 = Tasinato|first3 = Gianmassimo|year = 2012|doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2012/07/044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental approaches==
A new fundamental force might be difficult to test. Gravity, for example, is such a weak force that the gravitational interaction between two objects is only significant when one of them has a great mass. Therefore, it takes very sensitive equipment to measure gravitational interactions between objects that are small compared to the [[Earth]]. A new (or "fifth") fundamental force might similarly be weak and therefore difficult to detect. Nonetheless, in the late 1980s a fifth force, operating on municipal scales (i.e. with a range of about 100 meters), was reported by researchers (Fischbach ''et al.'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischbach|first1=Ephraim|last2=Sudarsky|first2=Daniel|last3=Szafer|first3=Aaron|last4=Talmadge|first4=Carrick|last5=Aronson|first5=S. H.|title=Reanalysis of the Eötvös experiment |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |date=6 January 1986|volume=56|issue=1|pages=3–6|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.56.3|pmid=10032514|bibcode=1986PhRvL..56....3F}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were reanalyzing [[Eötvös experiment|results of]] [[Loránd Eötvös]] from earlier in the century. The force was believed to be linked with [[hypercharge]]. Over a number of years, other experiments have failed to duplicate this result.&lt;ref&gt;University of Washington [http://www.npl.washington.edu/eotwash/ Eöt-Wash group], the leading group searching for a fifth force.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are at least three kinds of searches that can be undertaken, which depend on the kind of force being considered, and its range.

===Equivalence principle===
One way to search for a fifth force is with tests of the strong [[equivalence principle]]: this is one of the most powerful tests of Einstein's theory of gravity: [[general relativity]]. Alternative theories of gravity, such as [[Brans–Dicke theory]], have a fifth force&amp;mdash;possibly with infinite range. This is because gravitational interactions, in theories other than general relativity, have [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] other than the "[[metric tensor|metric]]", which dictates the [[curvature]] of space, and different kinds of degrees of freedom produce different effects. For example, a [[scalar field]] cannot produce the [[bending of starlight|bending of light rays]]. The fifth force would manifest itself in an effect on solar system orbits, called the [[Nordtvedt effect]]. This is tested with [[Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://funphysics.jpl.nasa.gov/technical/grp/lunar-laser.html Lunar Laser Ranging]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[very long baseline interferometry]].

===Extra dimensions===
Another kind of fifth force, which arises in [[Kaluza–Klein theory]], where the universe has [[extra dimensions]], or in [[supergravity]] or [[string theory]] is the [[Yukawa potential|Yukawa force]], which is transmitted by a light scalar field (i.e. a scalar field with a long [[Compton wavelength]], which determines the range). This has prompted a lot of recent interest, as a theory of [[supersymmetric]] large extra dimensions&amp;mdash;dimensions with size slightly less than a millimeter&amp;mdash;has prompted an experimental effort to test gravity on these very small scales. This requires extremely sensitive experiments which search for a deviation from the [[inverse square law]] of gravity over a range of distances.&lt;ref&gt;Satellite Energy Exchange (SEE) {{cite web |url=http://www.phys.utk.edu/see/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050507195406/http://www.phys.utk.edu/see/ |archivedate=2005-05-07 |df= }}, which is set to test for a fifth force in space, where it is possible to achieve greater sensitivity.&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, they are looking for signs that the Yukawa interaction is kicking in at a certain length.

Australian researchers, attempting to measure the [[gravitational constant]] deep in a mine shaft, found a discrepancy between the predicted and measured value, with the measured value being two percent too small. They concluded that the results may be explained by a repulsive fifth force with a range from a few centimetres to a kilometre. Similar experiments have been carried out on board a submarine, [[USS Dolphin (AGSS-555)|USS ''Dolphin'' (AGSS-555)]], while deeply submerged. A further experiment measuring the gravitational constant in a deep borehole in the Greenland ice sheet found discrepancies of a few percent, but it was not possible to eliminate a geological source for the observed signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ander|first1=Mark E. |display-authors=etal.|title=Test of Newton's inverse-square law in the Greenland ice cap|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=27 February 1989|volume=62|issue=9|pages=985–988|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.62.985|pmid=10040395 |bibcode=1989PhRvL..62..985A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zumberge|first1=Mark A.|display-authors=etal.|title=The Greenland Gravitational Constant Experiment|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|date=1990|volume=95|issue=B10|pages=15483|doi=10.1029/JB095iB10p15483|bibcode=1990JGR....9515483Z|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1231434|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earth's mantle===

Another experiment uses the [[earth's mantle]] as a giant particle detector, focusing on [[geoelectron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Aron, Jacob. (2013) [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23202-earths-mantle-helps-hunt-for-fifth-force-of-nature.html Earth's mantle helps hunt for fifth force of nature]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cepheid variables===

In 2012 Bhuvnesh Jain and others examined existing data on the rate of pulsation of [[cepheid variable]] stars in 25 galaxies comprising over a thousand stars in all. Theory suggests that the rate of pulsation would follow a different pattern in galaxies screened from a hypothetical fifth force by neighbourhood clusters from those that are not screened. They were unable to find any variation from Einstein’s theory of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  |arxiv= 1204.6044|last1= Cicoli|first1= Michele|title= Astrophysical Tests of Modified Gravity: Constraints from Distance Indicators in the Nearby Universe|journal= The Astrophysical Journal|volume= 779|pages= 39|last2= Pedro|first2= Francisco G.|last3= Tasinato|first3= Gianmassimo|year= 2012|doi= 10.1088/0004-637X/779/1/39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=1204.6044 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/779/1/39|title=Astrophysical Tests of Modified Gravity: Constraints from Distance Indicators in the Nearby Universe|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=779|issue=1|pages=39|year=2013|last1=Jain|first1=Bhuvnesh|last2=Vikram|first2=Vinu|last3=Sakstein|first3=Jeremy|bibcode=2013ApJ...779...39J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other approaches===

Some experiments used a lake plus a tower that is {{val|320|u=m}} high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Yi-Cheng|last2=Yang|first2=Xin-She|last3=Zhu|first3=Heng-Bin|last4=Zhou|first4=Wen-Hu|last5=Wang|first5=Qian-Shen|last6=Zhao|first6=Zhi-Qiang|last7=Jiang|first7=Wei-Wei|last8=Wu|first8=Chuan-Zhen|title=Testing non-Newtonian gravitation on a 320 m tower|journal=Physics Letters A|date=September 1992|volume=169|issue=3|pages=131–133|doi=10.1016/0375-9601(92)90582-7|bibcode=1992PhLA..169..131L}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive review by Ephraim Fischbach and Carrick Talmadge suggested there is no compelling evidence for the fifth force,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischbach|first1=Ephraim|last2=Talmadge|first2=Carrick|title=Six years of the fifth force|journal=Nature|date=19 March 1992|volume=356|issue=6366|pages=207–215|doi=10.1038/356207a0|bibcode=1992Natur.356..207F}}&lt;/ref&gt; though scientists still search for it. The Fishbach-Talmadge article was written in 1992, and since then, other evidence has come to light that may indicate a fifth force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jenkins|first1=Jere H.|last2=Fischbach|first2=Ephraim|last3=Buncher|first3=John B.|last4=Gruenwald|first4=John T.|last5=Krause|first5=Dennis E.|last6=Mattes|first6=Joshua J.|title=Evidence of correlations between nuclear decay rates and Earth–Sun distance|journal=Astroparticle Physics|date=August 2009|volume=32|issue=1|pages=42–46|arxiv=0808.3283|doi=10.1016/j.astropartphys.2009.05.004|bibcode=2009APh....32...42J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above experiments search for a fifth force that is, like gravity, independent of the composition of an object, so all objects experience the force in proportion to their masses. Forces that depend on the composition of an object can be very sensitively tested by [[torsion balance]] experiments of a type invented by [[Loránd Eötvös]]. Such forces may depend, for example, on the ratio of [[proton]]s to [[neutron]]s in an atomic nucleus, nuclear spin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=A. M. |last1=Hall |first2=H. |last2=Armbruster |first3=E. |last3=Fischbach |first4=C. |last4=Talmadge |chapter=Is the Eötvös experiment sensitive to spin? |title=Progress in High Energy Physics |pages=325–339 |editors=W.-Y. Pauchy Hwang, et al. |publisher=Elsevier |location=New York |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the relative amount of different kinds of [[binding energy]] in a nucleus (see the [[semi-empirical mass formula]]). Searches have been done from very short ranges, to municipal scales, to the scale of the [[Earth]], the [[sun]], and [[dark matter]] at the center of the galaxy.

==Modified gravity==
Also known as [[Principle of locality|non-local gravity]]. A few physicists&lt;ref name="arXiv:1310.4329v1 [astro-ph.CO]"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=S. Dodelson |author2=S.

This would change the gravity force to a non-local force{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}. They point out that [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] are unexplained by the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]] and suggest that some modification of gravity, possibly arising from [[Modified Newtonian Dynamics]] or the [[holographic principle]], is necessary. This is fundamentally different from conventional ideas of a fifth force, as it grows stronger relative to gravity at longer distances. Most physicists,{{Who|date=August 2010}} however, think that dark matter and dark energy are not ''[[ad hoc]]'', but are supported by a large number of [[complementary experiments|complementary observations]] and described by a very simple model.

==Possible evidence&lt;!--linked from 'dark photon' and 'dark radiation'--&gt;==
In 2015, [[Attila Krasznahorkay]] at the [[ATOMKI|Hungarian Academy of Sciences's Institute for Nuclear Research]] in [[Debrecen]], Hungary, and his colleagues posited the existence of a new, light boson only 34 times heavier than the electron.&lt;ref name="Cartlidge2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cartlidge|first=Edwin|title=Has a Hungarian physics lab found a fifth force of nature?|url=http://www.nature.com/news/has-a-hungarian-physics-lab-found-a-fifth-force-of-nature-1.19957|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.19957|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to find a [[dark photon]], the Hungarian team fired protons at thin targets of lithium-7, which created unstable [[beryllium-8]] nuclei that then decayed and spat out pairs of electrons and positrons. Excess decays were observed at an opening angle of 140° between the ''e''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and a combined energy of 17&amp;nbsp;MeV, which indicated that a small fraction of beryllium-8 will shed excess energy in the form of a new particle.

In 2016, Jonathan Feng et al., proposed that a protophobic X-boson with a mass of 16.7&amp;nbsp;MeV with suppressed couplings to protons relative to neutrons and electrons and femtometer range could explain the data. The force may explain m-2 muon anomaly and provide a dark matter candidate. Several research experiments are underway to attempt to validate or refute these results.&lt;ref name="Cartlidge2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Protophobic Fifth Force Interpretation of the Observed Anomaly in &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be Nuclear Transitions|author=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8269">A '''flowFET''' is a [[Microfluidics|microfluidic]] component which allows the rate of flow of [[liquid]] in a microfluidic channel to be modulated by the [[Electric potential|electrical potential]] applied to it. In this way, it behaves as a microfluidic analogue to  the [[Field-effect transistor|field effect transistor]],&lt;ref name="Schasfoort"&gt;{{cite journal

== Mechanism of action ==
{{Main|Electro-osmosis}}
[[File:FlowFET I-V curve.png|thumb|300px|The simulated flow velocity profile across a microfluidic channel as a function of depth into the channel from the wall (y-axis) for several different applied voltages.&lt;ref name="Kerkhoff" /&gt;]]
A flowFET relies on the principal of [[electro-osmosis|electro-osmotic flow]] (EOF). In many liquid-solid [[Interface (matter)|interfaces]], there is an [[Double layer (surface science)|electrical double layer]] that develops due to interactions between the two [[phase (matter)|phases]]. In the case of a microfluidic channel, this results in a charged layer of liquid on the periphery of the fluid column which surrounds the bulk of the liquid. This electric double layer has an associated [[voltage|potential difference]] known as the [[zeta potential]]. When an appropriately-oriented electrical field is applied to this interfacial double layer (i.e. parallel to the channel and in the plane of the electric double layer), the charged liquid ions experience a motive [[Lorentz force]]. Since this layer sheaths the fluid column, and since this layer moves, the entire column of liquid will begin to move with a speed &lt;math&gt;\nu_{EOF}&lt;/math&gt;. The velocity of the fluid layer "[[momentum diffusion|diffuses]]" into the bulk of the channel from the periphery towards the centre due to viscous coupling.&lt;ref name="Schasfoort" /&gt; The speed is related to the strength of the electric field &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, the magnitude of the zeta potential &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt;, the [[electrical permittivity|permittivity]] &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and the [[viscosity]] &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; of the fluid:&lt;ref name="Schasfoort" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\nu_{EOF}={\epsilon \over \eta} \zeta E&lt;/math&gt;

In a FlowFET, the zeta potential between the channel walls and the fluid can be altered by applying an electrical field ''perpendicular'' to the channel walls. This has the effect of altering the motive force experienced by the mobile liquid atoms in the double layer. This change in the zeta-potential can be used to control both the magnitude and direction of the electro-osmotic flow in the microchannel.&lt;ref name="Schasfoort" /&gt;

The controlling voltage need only be in the range of 50 V for a typical microfluidic channel,&lt;ref name="Kerkhoff"&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Kerkhoff

}}&lt;/ref&gt; since this correlates to a gradient of 1.5 MV/cm due to the channel size.&lt;ref name="Schasfoort" /&gt;

=== Operational limitations ===
Variation of the FlowFET dimensions (e.g. insulating layer thickness between the channel wall and gate electrode) due to the manufacturing process can lead to inexact control of the zeta potential. This can be exacerbated in the case of wall contamination, which can alter the channel wall surface's electrical properties adjacent to the gate electrode. This will affect the local flow characteristics, which may be especially important in chemical synthesis systems whose [[stoichiometry]] are directly related to the transport rate of reaction [[precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] and reaction products.&lt;ref name="Kerkhoff" /&gt;

There are constraints placed on the fluid that can be manipulated in a FlowFET. Since it relies on EOF, only fluids producing an EOF in response to an applied electric field may be used.&lt;ref name="Kerkhoff" /&gt;

While the controlling voltage need only be on the order of 50V,&lt;ref name="Kerkhoff" /&gt; the EOF-producing voltage along the channel axis is larger, on the order of 300V.&lt;ref name="Design"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is noticed experimentally that [[Electrolysis of water|electrolysis]] may occur at the [[electrode]] contacts. This water electrolysis can alter the [[pH]] in the channel and adversely affect [[Cell (biology)|biological cells]] and [[biomolecule]]s, while [[Bubble (physics)|gas bubbles]] tend to "clog" microfluidic systems.&lt;ref name="electrode"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In further analogy with [[microelectronic]] systems, the switching time for a flowFET is [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to its size. Scaling down a flowFET results in a reduction in the amount of time for the flow to equilibrate to a new flow rate following a change in the applied electrical field. It should be noted, however, that the frequency of flowFET is many orders of magnitude slower than with an electronic FET.

== Applications ==
A FlowFET sees potential uses in massively parallel microfluidic manipulation,&lt;ref name="Schasfoort" /&gt;  for example in [[DNA microarray]]s.&lt;ref name="Kerkhoff" /&gt;

Without using a FlowFET, it is necessary to control the rate of EOF by changing the magnitude of the EOF-producing field (i.e. the field parallel to the channel's axis) while leaving the zeta potential unaltered. In this arrangement, however, simultaneous control of EOF in channels connected with each other cannot easily be accomplished.&lt;ref name="Schasfoort" /&gt;

A FlowFET provides a way of controlling microfluidic flow in a way that uses no moving parts.&lt;ref name="Schasfoort" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kerkhoff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Design" /&gt; This is in stark contrast to other solutions including [[Peristaltic pump#Microfluidic pumps|pneumatically-actuated peristaltic pumps]] such as presented by Wu et al.&lt;ref name="Wu"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer moving parts allows less opportunity for [[wear|mechanical breakdown]] of a microfluidic device. This may be increasingly relevant as large future iterations of large  microelectronic fluidic (MEF) arrays continue to increase in size and complexity.

The use of bi-directional electronically-controlled flow has interesting options for particle and bubble cleaning operations.&lt;ref name="Kerkhoff" /&gt;

'''Game Genie''' is the name of a line of video game [[cheat cartridge]]s originally designed by [[Codemasters]] and sold by [[Camerica]] and [[Galoob]]. The first device in the series was released in 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Game Genie - The video game enhancer|url=http://www.nesworld.com/gamegenie.php|website=NES World}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], with subsequent devices released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], [[Game Boy]], [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]], and [[Game Gear]]. All the devices temporarily modify game data, manipulate various aspects of [[Video game|games]], and sometimes access unused assets and functions. Five million units of the original Game Genie products were sold worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.codemasters.com/press/?showarticle=1145 |title=Profile: Ted Carron - Producer of Dragon Empires |publisher=Codemasters |date= |accessdate=2009-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606183716/http://www.codemasters.com/press/?showarticle=1145 |archivedate=2011-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and most [[video game console emulator]]s feature Game Genie code support. Emulators that have Game Genie support also allow a near-unlimited number of codes to be entered whereas the actual products have a much smaller limit, between three and six codes.

In mid-1993 Codemasters began development on a "Game Genie 2", with Galoob again due to market and distribute the device in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Game Genie 2 Slated for 1995!|work=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=56|publisher=EGM Media, LLC|date=March 1994|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ultimately no Game Genie devices were released by Codemasters for the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth generation of consoles]]. However, other companies have produced similar hacking devices such as the [[Code Breaker]] and [[GameShark]]. The Game Genie brand was later revived by the company Hyperkin, who released cheat systems for newer consoles.

==Operation and design==
The original Game Genie systems were pass-through devices that attached between a [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] and the console. Upon starting the console, the player is presented with a menu that they can use to enter a series of characters referred to as a "[[Cheating in video games#Cheat codes|code]]", that reference addresses in the [[Read-only memory|ROM]] of the cartridge. Each code contains an [[integer (computer science)|integer]] value that is read by the system in place of the data actually present on the cartridge. The Game Genie is covered by US [[Patent]] #5112051, "Interfacing device for a computer games system", filed May 30, 1990. This patent expired on May 30, 2010, according to current US patent law.&lt;ref name="Patent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patentstation.com/mdm/p102.htm#length |title=Patent, Intellectual Property Attorney, Marc D. Machtinger |publisher=Patentstation.com |date=1995-06-08 |accessdate=2009-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Game Genie patches the program code of a game, the codes are sometimes referred to as [[patch (computing)|patch]] codes.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} These codes can have a variety of effects. Most published codes give the player some form of invulnerability, infinite ammunition, level skipping, or other modifications that allow the player to be more powerful than intended by the [[Video game developer|developer]]s. In rare cases, codes can make the game more difficult or even unlock hidden game features that developers had scrapped and rendered unreachable in normal play.

The Game Genie sold with a booklet of codes for use with various games available for the system. However, new codes continued to be developed and new games were released after these booklets were published. To address this, Galoob created a paid subscription service where subscribers would receive quarterly code updates. In addition, Galoob also ran ads in certain gaming publications, such as ''[[GamePro]]'', that featured codes for newer games.

To create new codes, it is possible to enter random codes into a Game Genie.  This evolutionary approach is equivalent to using random [[PEEK and POKE|POKE]] operations. Usually, entering random codes will result in no noticeable change in the game or [[Hang (computing)|freezing]] the game and possibly corrupting save data, but a useful difference may appear in the game if this process is repeated many times.  One must write down the random codes for each attempt because there is no method to view the codes after starting the game.  Once a useful code is discovered, making slight modifications to this code has a much higher probability of producing additional useful codes.  With ROM files, emulators, and decompilers for these games and systems, it has become possible to reverse engineer games to find specific ROM data to modify.  This information can be directly converted into Game Genie codes.

===NES===
[[File:Game-Genie-NES.jpg|thumb|120px|left|NES Game Genie]]
The Game Genie attaches to the end of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] cartridge, causing the cartridge to protrude from the console when fully inserted, making the depression impossible. Therefore, the Game Genie was designed in such a way that it did not need to be depressed in order to start the game. This design put even more stress on the [[Low Insertion Force|LIF]] socket than standard game insertion, bending pins and eventually causing units to be unplayable without the Game Genie present.&lt;ref name="NES"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927035859/http://nintendope.iodized.net/thisoldnes/nes.txt|title=Wayback Machine|date=27 September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the Game Genie also made it very difficult to insert into a newer [[Nintendo Entertainment System (Redesigned Model NES-101)|top-loading NES]] without pressing very hard. An adapter was created to deal with the problem, which Galoob offered to Game Genie owners free of charge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Buyers Beware|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=81|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1995|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; but few were requested, and the stock was liquidated.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

There also exists a version of the Game Genie for the Family Computer, distributed by Realtec and sold in Latin American countries.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Super NES===
[[File:Game-Genie-SNES.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Game Genie for Super NES]]
Initially the Game Genie did not work with [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] games that contain a [[List of Super NES enhancement chips|performance enhancing chip]], but did offer an updated version to address these problems with some games such as ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} The Game Genie remains incompatible with certain games, such as ''[[Star Fox (video game)|Star Fox]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://snescentral.com/article.php?id=0636|title=SNES Central: Star Fox|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''[[Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://snescentral.com/article.php?id=0049|title=SNES Central: Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, because those games use the extra pins that most other Super NES games never utilize, as there is no circuitry to accommodate these pins of the games' PCBs. It also has problems with the SNS-101 remodel SNES. When used with a SNS-101, only two codes can be used at a time, and they must be entered on the top and bottom lines of the Game Genie menu. There are three known versions of the SNES Game Genie (v1, v1.1, v2).&lt;ref&gt;http://gamehacking.org/wiki/Game_Genie_(Super_Nintendo)&lt;/ref&gt; Images of v1 and v2 PCB have been posted and the difference is night and day, with v2 containing much fewer components on the PCB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imgur.com/a/M8hmQ|title=SNES Game Genie v1 and v2 BOTH no dahses|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three versions look exactly the same from the outside but when v1.1 is booted up, it will have dashes present before any code is entered. The only way to tell v1 and v2 apart is by opening the cart and checking the PCB.

===Game Boy===
[[File:Game Genie.jpg|thumb|left|292x292px|Game Genie for [[Game Boy]]]]
The [[Game Boy]] edition similarly has a slot for cartridges while itself needing to be inserted into the console's game slot. It has two face buttons for toggling codes on/off or to return to the code input screen, and it houses a compartment to contain a very small code booklet in the back.

The physical design made it difficult to be used with any version of the Game Boy other than the original. Although it could be made to work, if one attempted to use the Game Genie on the [[Game Boy Pocket]] or [[Game Boy Color]], they would find the large top portion of the Game Genie would come into contact with the top of the Game Boy Pocket/Color before it was fully engaged. Therefore, the Game Genie would need to be bent backwards, placing strain on the mechanism to allow it to be pressed down far enough to reach the Game Boy Pocket/Color cartridge contacts. Despite this history, it will work fairly well with the [[Game Boy Advance SP]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} A standard unit will not fit in a [[Super Game Boy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Let's Get Technical|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=64|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=November 1994|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but with some minor modification to the plastic, it will fit and work normally.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} There was also a third party "Super Game Boy to Game Genie Adapter", allowing the player to connect the Game Genie to a Super Game Boy cartridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=Super Game Boy Gets its Genie|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=67|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=February 1995|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unit is also not compatible with Game Boy Color cartridges (which will not physically fit into the unit). This, however, includes original Game Boy games with Game Boy Color enhancements, when played in a Game Boy Color or Game Boy Advance system. However, color enhanced games will function if played in an original Game Boy system.

===Genesis===
[[File:Game-Genie-Genesis.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Game Genie cartridge for the Sega Genesis]]
On the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis/Mega Drive]], the Game Genie can function as a country converter cartridge since most of these games are only "[[Regional lockout|locked]]" to their respective regions by the shape of the cartridges and a set of a few bytes in the header of the ROM.
Some games do not work with the Genesis Game Genie; see "legal issues" below.

===Game Gear===
The [[Game Gear]] version of the Game Genie had a more complicated design than those for other systems. When inserted into the cartridge slot, another slot would pop-up to insert the Game Gear cartridge. It also had a compartment which contained a book of codes. The codes were printed on sticky labels to put on the back of the Game Gear cartridge. When entering codes, the player could easily see what to type in rather than looking through the book.

On the screen in which a code is entered for the Game Gear Game Genie, a player typing the word "DEAD" will cause the screen to move up and down, possibly as an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]].

Some games do not work with the Game Genie (see "legal issues" below).

==Legal issues==
{{main|Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of America, Inc.}}
The introduction of the original NES Game Genie was met by fierce opposition from [[Nintendo]]. Nintendo then sued Galoob in the case ''[[Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of America, Inc.|Galoob v. Nintendo]]'', claiming that the Game Genie created derivative works in violation of [[copyright|copyright law]]. Sales of the Game Genie initially stopped in the U.S., but not in Canada.&lt;ref name="Ninth_Circuit_Feb_1994"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://openjurist.org/16/f3d/1032/nintendo-of-america-inc-v-lewis-galoob-toys-inc |title=16 F3d 1032 Nintendo Of America Inc V. Lewis Galoob Toys Inc |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many [[Video game journalism|gaming magazines]] of the time, Galoob placed Game Genie ads saying "Thank You Canada!" However, after the courts found that use of the Game Genie did not result in a derivative work, Nintendo could do nothing to stop the Game Genie from being sold in the U.S.&lt;ref name="District_Court_July_1991"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14167398686354689030&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr |title=Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of America, Inc., 780 F. Supp. 1283 - Dist. Court, ND California 1991 |accessdate=February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the lawsuit was filed, Galoob offered to make the Game Genie an officially licensed product but was turned down by Nintendo.

Around the time of the lawsuit from Galoob, Nintendo tried to use other methods to thwart the Game Genie, using ROM checksums in later titles intended to detect the cheat modifications. These measures were partially successful but some could be bypassed with additional codes. Later versions of the Game Genie had the ability to hide Genie modifications from checksum routines.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

[[Sega]], on the other hand, was a full endorser of the Game Genie, with their official seal of approval. One of Sega's requirements for this, however, was that the Game Genie wouldn't work with games that have a save feature, such as the ''[[Phantasy Star (video game)|Phantasy Star]]'' or ''[[Shining Force]]'' series.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Game Genie 2==
[[File:Game Genie 2 Prototype for Super Nintendo.jpg|thumb|right|Game Genie 2 Prototype for Super NES (unreleased)]]
A substantially more powerful device was developed by Codemasters for the Super NES, with many improvements including the ability for users to find their own cheat codes, to selectively activate cheats during gameplay using the game controller, to switch games into a slow-motion mode, as well as automatically save and restore the high-scores from games into battery-backed memory on the Game Genie device itself. A fully working prototype of the device was completed, but was not brought to market due to changes in market conditions. One prototype is known to remain in existence, in the possession of Richard Aplin, one of the original creators.

== History ==
Despite that the idea of optical measurement of neuronal activity was proposed in the late 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=L. B.|last2=Keynes|first2=R. D.|last3=Hille|first3=B.|date=1968-05-04|title=Light scattering and birefringence changes during nerve activity|journal=Nature|volume=218|issue=5140|pages=438–441|issn=0028-0836|pmid=5649693}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first successful GEVI that was convenient enough to put into actual use was not developed until technologies of genetic engineering had become mature in the late 1990s. The first GEVI, coined FlaSh,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegel|first=M. S.|last2=Isacoff|first2=E. Y.|date=1997-10-01|title=A genetically encoded optical probe of membrane voltage|journal=Neuron|volume=19|issue=4|pages=735–741|issn=0896-6273|pmid=9354320}}&lt;/ref&gt; was constructed by fusing a modified [[green fluorescent protein]] with a voltage-sensitive K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel ([[Shaker gene|Shaker]]). Unlike fluorescent proteins, the discovery of new GEVIs were seldomly inspired by the nature, for it is hard to find an organism which naturally has the ability to change its fluorescence based on voltage. Therefore, new GEVIs are mostly the products of genetic and protein engineering.

Two methods can be utilized to find novel GEVIs: [[Protein design|rational design]] and [[directed evolution]]. The former method contributes to the most of new GEVI variants, but recent researches using directed evolution have shown promising results in GEVI optimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Platisa|first=Jelena|last2=Vasan|first2=Ganesh|last3=Yang|first3=Amy|last4=Pieribone|first4=Vincent A.|date=2017-03-15|title=Directed Evolution of Key Residues in Fluorescent Protein Inverses the Polarity of Voltage Sensitivity in the Genetically Encoded Indicator ArcLight|journal=ACS Chemical Neuroscience|volume=8|issue=3|pages=513–523|doi=10.1021/acschemneuro.6b00234|issn=1948-7193|pmc=5355904|pmid=28045247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
GEVI can have many configuration designs in order to realize voltage sensing function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gong|first=Yiyang|date=2015-08-01|title=The evolving capabilities of rhodopsin-based genetically encoded voltage indicators|journal=Current Opinion in Chemical Biology|volume=27|pages=84–89|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2015.05.006|issn=1879-0402|pmc=4571180|pmid=26143170}}&lt;/ref&gt; An essential feature of GEVI structure is that it must situate on the cell membrane. Conceptually, the structure of a GEVI should permit the function of sensing the voltage difference and reporting it by change in fluorescence. Usually, the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) of a GEVI spans across the membrane, and is connected to the fluorescent protein(s). However, it is not necessary that sensing and reporting should happen in different structures, e.g. Arch.

By structure, GEVIs can be classified into four categories based on the current findings: (1) GEVIs contain a fluorescent protein FRET pair, e.g. VSFP1, (2) Single opsion GEVIs, e.g. Arch, (3) Opsin-FP FRET pair GEVIs, e.g. MacQ-mCitrine, (4) single FP with special types of voltage sensing domains, e.g. ASAP1. A majority of GEVIs are based on the ''[[Ciona intestinalis]]'' [[voltage sensitive phosphatase]] (Ci-VSP or Ci-VSD (domain)), which was discovered in 2005 from the [[Genomics|genomic]] survey of the organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murata|first=Yoshimichi|last2=Iwasaki|first2=Hirohide|last3=Sasaki|first3=Mari|last4=Inaba|first4=Kazuo|last5=Okamura|first5=Yasushi|date=2005-06-30|title=Phosphoinositide phosphatase activity coupled to an intrinsic voltage sensor|journal=Nature|volume=435|issue=7046|pages=1239–1243|doi=10.1038/nature03650|issn=1476-4687|pmid=15902207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some GEVIs might have similar components, but with different positioning of them. For example, ASAP1 and ArcLight both use a VSD and one FP, but the FP of ASAP1 is on the outside of the cell whereas that of ArcLight is on the inside, and the two FPs of VSFP-Butterfly are separated by the VSD, while the two FPs of Mermaid are relatively close to each other.

== Characteristics ==
A GEVI can be evaluated by its many characteristics. These traits can be classified into two categories: performance and compatibility. The performance properties include brightness, [[photostability]], sensitivity, kinetics (speed), linearity of response, etc., while the compatibility properties cover toxicity ([[phototoxicity]]), plasma membrane localization, adaptability of deep-tissue imaging, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Helen H.|last2=St-Pierre|first2=François|date=2016-09-28|title=Genetically Encoded Voltage Indicators: Opportunities and Challenges|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|volume=36|issue=39|pages=9977–9989|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1095-16.2016|issn=1529-2401|pmc=5039263|pmid=27683896}}&lt;/ref&gt; For now, no existing GEVI meets all the desired properties, so searching for a perfect GEVI is still a quite competitive research area.

== Applications and advantages ==
Different types of GEVIs are seen being used in many biological or physiological research areas. It is thought to be superior to conventional voltage detecting methods like [[Single-unit recording|electrode-based]] electrophysiological recordings, [[calcium imaging]], or [[voltage sensitive dye]]s. It can show neuron signals with subcellular spatial resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaschula|first=Richard|last2=Salecker|first2=Iris|date=2016-06-30|title=Neuronal Computations Made Visible with Subcellular Resolution|journal=Cell|volume=166|issue=1|pages=18–20|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2016.06.022|issn=1097-4172|pmid=27368098}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has fast temporal resolution (sub-millisecond&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;), matching or surpassing that of the electrode recordings, and about one magnitude faster than calcium imaging.

'''Giulia Occhini''' (born in [[Varano Borghi]], 23 July 1922 - died in [[Novi Ligure]], 6 January 1993), known as "La Dama Bianca" (“The White Lady”), was the lover of champion cyclist [[Fausto Coppi]] in a scandalous extramarital affair of the 1950s.

Given Coppi’s high profile, this affair led to the shift in attitudes among the [[Christian Democrats]] in Italy towards the moral and legal aspects of adultery. At the time in Italy, divorce was not permitted and adultery was still a crime. Occhini herself was tried for abandoning her marriage. Her story became emblematic of the conformist and repressive climate of that period.&lt;ref name="De Zan 75"&gt;De Zan, p.75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fossati"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Quella Trasgressione Sentimentale Che Indignò La Provincia Bigotta |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1993/01/07/quella-trasgressione-sentimentale-che-indigno-la-provincia.html?ref=search}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her nickname originated after the 1954 [[St. Moritz]] stage of the [[Giro d'Italia]], when Pierre Chany, a journalist with ''[[L'Équipe]]'', wrote: "We would like to know more about that lady in white (''dame en blanc'') we saw near Coppi,”&lt;ref name="Morte"&gt;{{Cite news |title=La Morte Della 'Dama Bianca'|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1993/01/07/la-morte-della-dama-bianca.html?ref=search}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the snow-coloured duffel coat she wore.&lt;ref name="Morte" /&gt;

== Biography ==
Occhini was married to Enrico Locatelli, a medical practitioner in Varano Borghi, and who was  a passionate fan of Coppi. She met Fausto Coppi during the 1953 Tour at the end of the [[Passo dello Stelvio]] stage and publicly appeared with the "Campionissimo" at the World Championships Prize 1953 in [[Lugano]]. Their friendship started in 1948 when the Locatelli had asked his wife to obtain an autograph of the "Campionissimo" at the end of the [[Tre Valli Varesine]]. Later Occhini entered into correspondence with Coppi, who, solicited by Locatelli, personally met his family in a short visit to Varese. A romance began between Occhini and Coppi and they spent the summer together as lovers in 1953, vacationing in [[Capri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.150anni.it/webi/index.php?s=60&amp;wid=1997|title=La Scuola per i 150 anni dell'Unità d'Italia - Dagli anni Cinquanta ad oggi (1951-2011) - Occhini Giulia|first=EMIS Studios -|last=MIUR|website=www.150anni.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since they were both married, the relationship aroused great scandal at that time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciclismoweb.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7547:fausto-coppi-rileggiamo-la-leggenda-del-campionissimo&amp;catid=72:le-due-ruote-della-storia&amp;Itemid=67|title=Ciclismoweb.Net|website=www.ciclismoweb.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was strongly opposed by public opinion, particularly by Fausto Coppi's fans, and Occhini was even the recipient of [[Pope Pius XII]]'s public condemnation. Coppi and his wife, Bruna Ciampolini, unanimously separated in 1954, while Locatelli denounced Occhini for adultery. As a result of this, according to Italian law of time, the lovers having been caught “in flagrante”, the woman was punished with a month's imprisonment in [[Alessandria]] and then a period of house arrest in [[Ancona]]. Coppi’s passport was withdrawn. Among these many difficulties, Coppi and Occhini married in Mexico (a marriage never recognized in Italy) and Occhini gave birth to a son, Angelo Fausto Coppi, who was born on May 13, 1955 in Buenos Aires.

Giulia Occhini died on January 6, 1993. After almost a year and a half of coma. She had been admitted to San Giacomo Hospital in Novi Ligure following injuries sustained in a car accident that occurred just in front of Villa Coppi in hamlet [[Barbellotta]] of Novi Ligure on 3 August 1991 on board a [[Fiat Tipo]], driven by a family friend, who was hit by a [[Volkswagen Golf GTI]] with two young people on board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,0013/articleid,0769_01_1993_0006_0013_10858713/ Dama Bianca, sei anni in fuga con Coppi] Archiviolastampa.it&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1991/08/04/scontro-davanti-villa-coppi-la-dama.html|title=SCONTRO DAVANTI A VILLA COPPI LA ' DAMA BIANCA' IN FIN DI VITA - la Repubblica.it|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giulia Occhini is buried in the new graveyard of Serravalle Scrivia, next to her daughter Loretta "Lolli" Locatelli (1946-1981), who died of [[leukemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1993/gennaio/07/addio_della_Dama_bianca_silenzio_co_0_9301072551.shtml|title=Archivio Corriere della Sera|website=archiviostorico.corriere.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The "white lady" in popular culture ==
* Giulia Occhini appeared as a character in the 1995 telemovie ''[[Il Grande Fausto]]'' ("The Great Fausto"), played by [[Ornella Muti]] 
* She was also portrayed in the 2006 miniseries ''[[Gino Bartali — Il intramontabile]]'' ("Gino Bartali - The Timeless"), played by [[Valentina Bruscoli]].
* Italian bicycle manufacturer [[Bianchi (company)|Bianchi]], which had close ties to Coppi, uses the brand "Dama Bianca" for its range of women's bicycles.

'''James Dallas Yeomans''' (April 21, 1845 &amp;ndash; October 31, 1906) was an American politician and railway executive, who served from 1894 to 1905 as a commissioner of the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]].

Born in [[Bennington, New York]], and educated there, Yeomans worked as a railwayman from age 17, rising to the position of general superintendent.  After spending time building railways, he moved to Iowa, where was elected to the State Senate.  He became head of a manufacturer's association, and was appointed to the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1894 by President [[Grover Cleveland]].  Yeomans was reappointed by President [[William McKinley]] and then by [[Theodore Roosevelt]].  He retired from the commission in 1905 and spent time pursuing his business interests until he died in Washington DC in 1906.

==Early life==
Yeomans was born in [[Bennington, New York]] and educated in the public schools there.&lt;ref name = "icc"&gt;{{Citation
  | title = The Interstate Commerce Commission:  the First Fifty Years
  | publisher = The George Washington University Law Review
  | year = 1938
  | pages = 614–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1862, he obtained a job with the [[Erie Railroad|Erie Railroad Company]], and served two years with the company.  He then went to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], and worked on railroads for the Federal Government for the remainder of the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref name = "icc"/&gt;

==Executive==
Yeomans returned to the Northeast after the war.  In 1872, he became assistant superintendent of the [[Buffalo, New York and Philadelphia Railway]], and a year later was made its superintendent.  He also served as General Superintendent of the [[Olean, Bradford and Warren Railway]].&lt;ref name = "icc"/&gt;  He was then involved in railroad building in New York, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.&lt;ref name = "obit"&gt;{{Citation

| format=PDF
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
In 1888, Yeomans moved to Iowa, where he engaged in stock farming.  In 1890, he was elected to the [[Iowa State Senate]].&lt;ref name = "icc"/&gt;

Yeomans helped organize the Sioux City Jobbers' and Manufacturers' Association, which became powerful in protecting the interest of the commercial cities of the Upper Midwest.  It was the work for the association that suggested him as a candidate for the ICC.&lt;ref name = "icc"/&gt;

On April 2, 1894, President Cleveland appointed him to fill an unexpired term through 1898, filling a vacancy caused by the death of Commissioner [[James W. McDill]].  Yeomans was confirmed by the Senate on April 27, and took the oath of office five days later.  He was reappointed by President McKinley on January 6, 1899, for a full term ending December 31, 1904, and was confirmed the following day.  President Roosevelt reappointed Yeomans on January 13, 1905, for a third term, and Yeomans was confirmed by the Senate the same day.  He resigned on March 1, 1905, effective March 6, and was succeeded by former Senator [[Francis Cockrell]].&lt;ref name = "icc"/&gt;

After his retirement from the ICC, Yeomans devoted himself to his business interests.&lt;ref name = "obit"/&gt;  He died October 31, 1906, according to ''[[The New York Times]]'' of a complication of disease.&lt;ref name = "obit"/&gt;

'''Joseph Siffert''' (7 July 1936 – 24 October 1971) was a Swiss [[racing driver]].

Affectionately known as "Seppi" to his family and friends, Siffert was born in [[Fribourg, Switzerland]], the son of a dairy owner. He initially made his name in racing on two wheels, winning the Swiss 350&amp;nbsp;cc [[motorcycle]] championship in 1959, before switching to four wheels with a [[Formula Junior]] Stanguellini. Siffert graduated to [[Formula One]] as a privateer in 1962, with a four-cylinder [[Team Lotus|Lotus]]-[[Coventry Climax|Climax]]. He later moved to Swiss team [[Scuderia Filipinetti]], and in 1964 joined [[Rob Walker (motorsport)|Rob Walker]]'s private British [[Rob Walker Racing Team]]. Early successes included victories in the non-Championship [[1964 Mediterranean Grand Prix|1964]] and [[1965 Mediterranean Grand Prix|1965 Mediterranean Grands Prix]], both times beating [[Jim Clark]] by a very narrow margin. He won two races in Formula One for the [[Rob Walker Racing Team]] and [[British Racing Motors|BRM]]. He died at the [[1971 World Championship Victory Race]], having his car roll over after a crash caused by a mechanical failure and being caught under the burning vehicle. Siffert was married twice and to his second wife Simone during the height of his career in the late 1960s and at the time of his death. They had two children together, Véronique and Philippe.

== Life and career ==

=== Formula One ===
[[File:Porsche 906 mit J. Siffert am 03.06.1966.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Siffert at the wheel of a [[Porsche 906]] in practice for the 1966 [[1000 km Nürburgring]] race]]
In 1968, Siffert drove into the F1 history books by winning the [[1968 British Grand Prix]] at [[Brands Hatch]] in [[Rob Walker Racing Team]]'s [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] 49B, beating [[Chris Amon]]'s [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] into second place after a race-long battle. This is regarded as the last GP victory by a genuine privateer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forix.com/8w/walker.html |title=8W – What? – R R C Walker Racing Team|accessdate=2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sports cars ===
While Siffert's status in F1 grew slowly, his fame came as a leading driver for the factory [[Porsche in motorsport|Porsche]] effort in its quest for the [[World Sportscar Championship]]. In 1968, Siffert and [[Hans Herrmann]] won the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] and the [[12 Hours of Sebring]] in a [[Porsche 907]], marking the first major outright wins for the company, apart from a few earlier victories on twisty tracks.

[[File:Porsche 908 - Josef Siffert 1970-05-31.jpg|thumb|right|Siffert in the Porsche 908.03 at the 1970 1,000 km Nürburgring]]
[[File:1971-05-29 Joseph Siffert, Porsche 908-3 (Gegengerade).jpg|thumb|right|Siffert at the wheel of a Porsche 908]]
[[File:Siffert at 1969 Dutch Grand Prix.jpg|thumb|right|Siffert at the [[1969 Dutch Grand Prix]].]]

Later on, Siffert's driving displays in the [[Porsche 917]] earned him several major wins in Europe. In addition, Siffert was chosen by Porsche to help launch its [[Can-Am Challenge Cup|CanAm]] development programme, driving a [[Porsche 917]]PA spyder in 1969 and finishing fourth in the championship despite few entries.

In 1970 he teamed up with [[Brian Redman]] to drive a [[Porsche 908]]/3 to victory at the [[Targa Florio]]. That same year, Porsche bankrolled Siffert's seat in a works [[March Engineering]] F1 since the German company did not wish to lose one of their prize drivers to rival Ferrari. His association with March in F1 was disastrous, so he was pleased to join rival Porsche racer [[Pedro Rodriguez (racing driver)|Pedro Rodriguez]] at [[British Racing Motors|BRM]] the following season.

=== Death ===
Siffert won the [[1971 Austrian Grand Prix]], and was later killed in the non-championship [[1971 World Championship Victory Race|World Championship Victory Race]] at [[List of Brands Hatch Circuit fatal accidents|Brands Hatch]], Kent, England, the scene of his first victory in 1968. The suspension of his BRM had been damaged in a lap one incident with [[Ronnie Peterson]], and broke later. This was not admitted by BRM until much later when it was accidentally divulged by a BRM ex-mechanic.&lt;ref name=blick1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benoit|first1=Roger|title=Jo Siffert (7. Juli 1936 - 24. Oktober 1971)|url=http://www.blick.ch/sport/formel1/artikel29805|website=blick.ch|publisher=''Der Blick''|accessdate=20 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712212439/http://www.blick.ch/sport/formel1/artikel29805|archivedate=12 July 2011|date=24 December 2005|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BRM crashed and immediately caught fire. Siffert could not free himself from the burning car.

This accident led to a rapid overhaul of safety, both in-car and on circuit. In the subsequent Royal Automobile Club (the UK organising and regulatory representative of the FIA at the time) investigation, it was discovered that the crash itself caused non-fatal injuries but Siffert had rather been killed by smoke inhalation. None of the trackside fire extinguishers worked, and it was found to be impossible to reach the car and extract Siffert because of the intense fire. On-board fire extinguishers (using BCF—[[bromochlorodifluoromethane]], an aircraft product) became mandatory and also piped air for the drivers, direct into their helmets.

His funeral in Switzerland was attended by 50,000 people and a Gulf-[[Porsche 917]] of Team [[John Wyer]] led the hearse and procession through the streets of Fribourg. Benoit was a period Formula 1 sports reporter and knew Siffert well. He was also present at Siffert's tragic last Brands Hatch race in 1971. The night before the race, Benoit took pictures of Siffert, his wife Simone and his mother Maria as well as a friend Jean Tinguely at an evening victory celebration.&lt;ref name=blick2&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benoit|first1=Roger|title=Jo Siffert (7. Juli 1936 – 24. Oktober 1971) Das Scheckheft des Todes|url=http://www.blick.ch/sport/formel1/artikel29807|website=blick.ch|publisher=''Der Blick''|accessdate=20 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708005630/http://www.blick.ch/sport/formel1/artikel29807|archivedate=8 July 2009|language=German|date=24 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then also took the very last picture of Siffert alive as he sat waiting in his BRM in the pole position on the starting line five minutes before the start of the race.

=== Legacy ===
In the final round of the [[2007-08 A1 Grand Prix season|2007–08 A1GP season]], at [[Brands Hatch]], the [[A1 Team Switzerland]] car carried the message ''Jo 'Seppi' Siffert - 40th Anniversary - Brands Hatch''. This commemorated his [[1968 British Grand Prix]] victory at Brands Hatch.

'''Julius Munyelele Indongo''' (born 12 February 1983) is a [[Namibia]]n [[professional boxer]]. He is a former unified [[light-welterweight]] world champion, having held the [[WBA (Unified)]], [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]], and [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] titles between 2016 and 2017. As an [[amateur boxer|amateur]], Indongo represented Namibia at the [[2008 Olympics]], reaching the first round of the [[lightweight]] bracket.

==Amateur career==
Indongo first took up boxing at the age of 17. In 2002, he won the amateur Namibian National Championships and he appeared poised for success. However, Indongo was struck by [[tuberculosis]], which interrupted his career for 2 years. After recovering, Indongo qualified to represent his country in the [[2008 Olympics]]. Right before his first fight, Indongo broke his right hand. He decided to fight regardless but was easily outpointed by [[Anthony Little (boxer)|Anthony Little]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ringtv.com/514563-african-village-espn-julius-indongo-sets-sights-history/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
===Early career===
Indongo debuted professionally at the age of 25, on 25 July 2009, with a [[points decision]] (PTS) win over Pohamba Mandume. After winning his first six fights, he won his first regional title, the Namibian [[lightweight]] title, by defeating Samuel Kapapu, and retained it against Peter Malakia.

After improving to 14 consecutive wins, he won the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] Africa [[light-welterweight]] title in October 2012 via victory over James Onyango. Indongo went on to make six successful defenses of that title between 2014 and 2016. Indongo was a late bloomer on the world stage, with his first world title fight taking place when he was 33. His trainer, Nestor Tobias, stated that he often needed to be more aggressive and "deliver the killer punch".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newera.com.na/2015/02/06/beware-blue-machine-ready-conquer-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unified light-welterweight champion===
In October 2016, undefeated [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] and [[International Boxing Organization|IBO]] light-welterweight champion [[Eduard Troyanovsky]] (25-0, 22 KOs) stated he would make a voluntary defence on the [[Denis Lebedev|Lebedev]]-[[Murat Gassiev|Gassiev]] card in Russia on 3 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/eduard-troyanovsky-make-voluntary-defense-december--109783|title=Eduard Troyanovsky To Make Voluntary Defense in December|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 November, Indongo, who was ranked WBO #3, WBA #15 and IBF #10, was announced as his opponent, for the fight to take place in Moscow, in his first bout held outside of Namibia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/eduard-troyanovsky-vs-julius-indongo-on-december-3--110535|title=Eduard Troyanovsky vs. Julius Indongo on December 3|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a favoured underdog, Indongo knocked out Troyanovsky after only forty seconds of the first round with a [[left hook]], becoming Namibia's fourth world boxing champion. Troyanovsky was badly hurt from the shot and did not get up. Referee Mark Calo-Oy immediately halted the fight with Troyanovsky still down on the canvas. After some assistance, they eventually got Troyanovsky back to his feet and took him out of the ring.&lt;ref&gt;Sukachev, Alexey (3 December 2016).

In late December, there were talks for a potential unification fight between Indongo and [[List of WBA world champions#Super lightweight|WBA]] champion [[Ricky Burns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fightnews.com/Boxing/burns-vs-indongo-unification-clash-385071|title=Burns vs. Indongo unification clash?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2016/12/ricky-burns-vs-julius-indongo-works/|title=Ricky Burns vs. Julius Indongo in the works|last=|first=|date=December 27, 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 January, Burns' manager Tommy Morrison confirmed a deal was being put together for Burns to fight Indongo in a unification fight in April at [[The SSE Hydro]] in Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/10722809/ricky-burns-could-have-unification-fight-with-julius-indongo-in-glasgow-says-alex-morrison|title=Ricky Burns could have unification fight with Julius Indongo in Glasgow, says Alex Morrison|last=|first=|date=January 9, 2017|website=Sky Sports|publisher=|access-date=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/boxing/ricky-burns-lands-hydro-unification-fight-against-namibian-1-4334675|title=Ricky Burns lands Hydro unification fight against Namibian|last=|first=|date=January 8, 2017|website=|publisher=|access-date=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 January, [[Sky Sports]] confirmed a deal was reached for Burns and Indongo in a unification title bout on 15 April 2017.

In the last two rounds, Burns hit the canvas three times, but these were ruled as a slip. Following the defeat, Burns praised Indongo, "He was so so awkward. He was a lot better than we thought he was going to be. He can hit as well." He also said that he wouldn't retire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/39611722|title=Ricky Burns loses WBA super-lightweight belt to Julius Indongo in Glasgow|date=2017-04-15|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2017-04-16|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/19167327/aggessive-julis-indongo-dominates-ricky-burns-unify-wba-ibf-super-lightweight-titles|title=Ricky Burns has no answers for Indongo|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On fight night, Crawford blasted Indongo, knocking him down in the second round before finishing him with a vicious body shot in just three rounds.&lt;ref&gt;https://sports.yahoo.com/terence-crawford-kos-julius-indongo-three-rounds-become-undisputed-champion-041722282.html&lt;/ref&gt; The fight took place in front of a raucous home crowd for Crawford. Crawford landed 27 total punches to Indongo's 13 and 17 power punches to Indongo's 10. Following the fight, Indongo stated "When he hit me like that, my mind was gone" about Crawford's body shot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boxingscene.com/indongo-terence-crawford-hit-me-it-hurt-bad--119660&lt;/ref&gt; According to CompuBox stats, Crawford landed 26 of his 75 punches thrown (35%), while Indongo landed 13 of 74 thrown (18%).

=== Career from 2018 ===
On 5 January 2018, [[Lou DiBella]] of DiBella Entertainment announced that he had signed Indongo on a long-term promotional contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/julius-indongo-inks-promotional-pact-with-lou-dibella--124031|title=Julius Indongo Inks Promotional Pact With Lou DiBella|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-01-06|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few hours later, Nestor Tobias, Indongo's manager and promoter from Namibia claimed that Indongo and DiBella had breached contract. Tobias stated that Indongo was under contract with his MTC Nestor Sunshine Boxing &amp; Fitness Academy until 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/indongos-promoter-furious-says-boxer-still-under-contract--124050|title=Indongo's Promoter is Furious, Says Boxer is Still Under Contract|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WBC super lightweight title became vacant after Terence Crawford decided to move up to welterweight. It was announced that number 1 ranked [[Amir Imam]] would fight number 3 ranked [[Jose Ramírez|Jose Ramirez]] for the vacant title. WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman then announced that [[Viktor Postol]], who was ranked number 4, would fight number 2 ranked [[Regis Prograis]] (20-0, 17 KOs) for the interim WBC title. The winner of both fights would then meet to become the full titleholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/prograis-vs-postol-ordered-winner-faces-ramirez-imam--122455|title=Prograis vs. Postol To Be Ordered, Winner Faces Ramirez or Imam - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, a deal was finally reached for the fight between Postol and Prograis to take place on 9 March at the Buffalo Run Casino in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ringtv.com/526479-regis-prograis-viktor-postol-set-junior-welterweight-bout-showtime/|title=Regis Prograis, Viktor Postol set for junior welterweight bout on Showtime - The Ring|date=2018-01-17|work=The Ring|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 February, ESPN reported that Postol suffered a fractured thumb and forced to drop out of the bout. Indongo was announced as his replacement, with the bout still taking place on 9 March, however the venue was changed to Deadwood Mountain Grand, a casino and resort in [[Deadwood, South Dakota]], with [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] televising the bout live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/postol-suffers-injury-indongo-fight-prograis-on-march-9--125185|title=Postol Suffers Injury, Indongo to Fight Prograis on March 9|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prograis knocked Indongo down four times in the fight, dropping him once in round 1 and three more times in round 2 before referee Ian John Lewis stopped the fight at 2:54 of round 2. Indongo started the fight well before being hit with a hard jab that dropped him. Indongo was hurt with this shot. Indongo fought close to Prograis, which seemed to benefit Prograis. After the fight, Prograis told Showtime's [[Steve Farhood]], “After the first round, I felt his punches. He couldn't punch. He couldn’t hurt me. I got a little reckless. But, I got the job done, so I can’t complain.” Prograis landed 46 of 94 punches thrown (49%) and Indongo connected on 32 of his 120 thown (27%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/regis-prograis-destroys-julius-indongo-two-results--126069|title=Regis Prograis Destroys Julius Indongo in Two Rounds|work=BoxingScene.com|access-date=2018-03-10|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the son of [[Khosrau II | Khosrow II]]. He became king after orchestrating a [[coup d'état]] against his father.

== Biography ==
Kavadh II was the son of [[Khosrau II | Khosrow II]], the king of the Sasanian Empire, and [[Maria (daughter of Maurice)|Maria]], daughter of [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]], the emperor of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Kavadh was later imprisoned by his father, who wanted to ensure the succession of his favorite son [[Mardanshah (Sasanian prince)|Mardanshah]], the son of his favorite wife, [[Shirin]].
 
His father's reputation had been ruined during the last phase of the [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628]]. In 627, the Sasanian general [[Rhahzadh]] was slain and [[Dastagird|Dastgerd]], the king's favorite residence, had been sacked into oblivion by Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]], who was advancing towards the nearby Sasanian capital of [[Ctesiphon]] (both in present Iraq). In 628, Kavadh was released by the feudal families of the Sasanian Empire, which included the [[Ispahbudhan]] ''[[spahbed]]'' (army chief) [[Farrukh Hormizd]] and his two sons [[Rostam Farrokhzad]] and [[Farrukhzad]], [[Shahrbaraz]] of the [[House of Mihran]], the Armenian faction represented by [[Varaztirots II Bagratuni]] and finally the [[Kanarang]].&lt;ref&gt;Pourshariati (2008), p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 February, Kavadh, along with [[Aspad Gushnasp]], captured Ctesiphon and imprisoned Khosrow II. Kavadh II then proclaimed himself as king of the Sasanian Empire and ordered the execution of all his brothers and half-brothers, which included his main rival Mardanshah, the favorite son of Khosrow II. Three days later he ordered [[Mihr Hormozd]] to execute his father. However, after the regicide of his father, Kavadh had Mihr Hormozd killed.{{sfn|Al-Tabari|1999|pp=389}}

With the agreement of the Persian nobles, Kavadh then made peace with the victorious emperor Heraclius, which awarded the Byzantines to (re)gain all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a [[war indemnity]], along with the [[True Cross]] and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614.&lt;ref name = "Oman212"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oman|1893|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6A-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA212 212]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kaegi|2003|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA178 178], [https://books.google.com/books?id=tlNlFZ_7UhoC&amp;pg=PA189 189–190]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kavadh also appointed Armenian nobleman [[Varaztirots II Bagratuni]] as [[Marzban]] (margrave and military viceroy) of [[Persian Armenia]], and appointed [[Ishoyahb II]] (628–645) as the new [[Catholicos]] (Eastern Patriarch) of the Nestorian [[Church of the East]] (at Seleucia-Ctesiphon).&lt;ref&gt;Nahal Tajadod, ''Les Porteurs de Lumière'', Plon, Paris, 1993, 323–324.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Kavadh II later died from plague after a few months' reign on 6 September 628. He was succeeded by his eight-year-old son [[Ardashir III]], for whom he decreed Emperor Heraclius act as regent. These decisions along with his Christian faith (from his mother) led the [[Zoroastrian]] priesthood to eliminate him and his young heir not long after.

==Marriage==
A passage of the [[Bishopric of Edessa|Chronicle of Edessa]] identifies "Anzoy the Roman" as the wife of Kavadh II and mother of Ardashir III. She was probably a Christian princess from the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref name="PLRE"&gt;Martindale, Jones &amp; Morris (1992), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

Siroe is the subject of [[opera]]s by a number of composers on a libretto by [[Metastasio]], including [[Pasquale Errichelli]], [[Johann Adolph Hasse]], [[Leonardo Vinci]], [[Antonio Vivaldi]] and [[George Frideric Handel]]. He is also identified as Solomon of Persia by the [[Alians]].

'''Kermit Alan Washington''' (born September 17, 1951) is an American former professional [[basketball]] player. Washington is best remembered for punching opposing player [[Rudy Tomjanovich]] during an on-court fight in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, Liz. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60A12FD3E5F0C738FDDA80894DD404482&amp;pagewanted=2 Inside the N.B.A.; Three Decades Later, Washington Still Feels Effects of His Punch], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 30, 2005, accessed November 17, 2010.&lt;br&gt;*Zirin, Dave. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/dave_zirin/09/08/punch/ Kermit Washington reaches out to Oregon RB LeGarrette Blount], sportsillustrated.com, September 8, 2009, accessed November 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His punch nearly killed Tomjanovich, and resulted in severe medical problems that ultimately ended Tomjanovich's playing career. 

Washington was not a highly coveted player coming out of high school and barely got into college on an athletic scholarship. He averaged a mere four points per game (ppg) during his senior season of high school. He improved rapidly once at [[American University]], and became one of only seven players in [[NCAA]] history to average 20 [[point (basketball)|points]] and 20 rebounds throughout the course of their career.

A big defensive forward, Washington was known for his ability to gather [[Rebound (basketball)|rebounds]]. He averaged 9.2 points and 8.3 rebounds per game in ten [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) seasons and played in the [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] once. Washington was drafted by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] with the fifth overall pick in the [[1973 NBA draft]]. He played sparingly his first three seasons, and sought the help of retired basketball coach [[Pete Newell]] before his fourth season. Under Newell's tutelage, Washington's game rapidly improved and he became a starter for several teams. He played for the Lakers, [[Boston Celtics]], [[San Diego Clippers]], [[Portland Trail Blazers]] and [[Golden State Warriors]].

==Early life==
Kermit Washington's mother Barbara&lt;ref name="Fn110"&gt;Feinstein pg. 110&lt;/ref&gt; graduated from Miner's Teacher's College (later subsumed into [[Howard University]]), where she was an excellent student; his father Alexander was an [[Radiologic technologist|X-ray technician]].&lt;ref name="Fn110"/&gt;&lt;ref name="halb"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Washington had a rough childhood.&lt;ref name="halb"/&gt; When he was three years old, his parents had a fight in which his maternal uncle became involved and in which someone violently attacked his uncle with an iron.&lt;ref name="halb"/&gt; His parents soon divorced, with his father awarded custody of the children. His mother, who suffered from [[bipolar disorder]], then took him and his older brother Eric from their father on an ill-advised sojourn for which they were poorly prepared.&lt;ref name="halb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 110–11&lt;/ref&gt; Struggling to find money to feed the children, she eventually called their father, who came and took them back.&lt;ref name="halb"/&gt; His stay with his father did not last long, and he and his brother were passed around to various relatives on both sides of the family.&lt;ref name="halb"/&gt;

The effect of being shuttled into and out of the homes of family members led to a feeling of not being wanted, which made Washington extremely shy as a youth.&lt;ref name="halb2"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 257&lt;/ref&gt; The only time he recalls feeling a sense of self-worth was when his great-grandmother on his father's side had the pair for a while.&lt;ref name="halb2"/&gt; According to Washington, she loved the boys but was extremely strict, domineering, and at times, physically abusive.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 111–12&lt;/ref&gt; After his father remarried, the children moved back in with him and his new wife. Washington felt a sense of optimism for the first time, saying "I thought it was our dream come true. All our lives we had seen nice families on TV. Real ones. Now we were going to be a real family."&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 111&lt;/ref&gt; However, he again felt unwanted this time by his stepmother.&lt;ref name="halb2"/&gt; As a small child, Washington said that he had no recollections of ever being hugged, and only felt close to his younger brother, [[Chris Washington|Chris]].&lt;ref name="halb2"/&gt; Washington was a poor student who hated school throughout most of his childhood.&lt;ref name="halb3"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 258&lt;/ref&gt; He had to retake many of his classes in [[summer school]] to raise his grades.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 121&lt;/ref&gt; When he entered high school he played football merely so he could be around a close friend, and have someone to walk home with at night as he was terrified of walking home alone.&lt;ref name="halb3"/&gt;

As a senior in high school, Washington stood {{height|ft=6|in=4}} but weighed a mere 150&amp;nbsp;lbs.&lt;ref name="halb3"/&gt; After some rare positive feedback by his biology teacher, Barbara Thomas, he began to study and put forth a greater effort in that class.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="halb4"/&gt; He quickly became a solid student in biology but poor in all other subjects.&lt;ref name="halb4"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 259&lt;/ref&gt; When Thomas became his [[home room]] teacher and saw his grades in other classes she encouraged him to try hard in all of his courses.&lt;ref name="halb4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Washington rapidly improved his marks, making the honor roll in his senior year.&lt;ref name="halb4"/&gt;

His basketball performance in high school was unimpressive.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 114&lt;/ref&gt; He came off the bench to average four [[points per game]] (ppg).&lt;ref name="halb4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 122&lt;/ref&gt; His stepmother informed him that when he graduated from high school he would be thrown out of the house.&lt;ref name="halb4"/&gt; Chris had been able to leave home on a [[athletic scholarship|football scholarship]] and would later play in the [[National Football League]], but Washington himself had nowhere to go.&lt;ref name="halb4"/&gt; He trained for three hours a day toward the end of his senior season, and showed up uninvited at a [[streetball|playground game]] featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pgs. 259-60&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 116–8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Young (basketball coach)|Tom Young]], who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at the University of Maryland to become head coach at [[American University]], saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pg. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==College years==
During the summer between his senior year of high school and his freshman year of college, Washington grew four inches.&lt;ref name="halb261"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 261&lt;/ref&gt; He began an intense regimen of weight training, and ran up and down the flights of steps in his seven-story dormitory building wearing a weighted vest to improve his endurance.&lt;ref name="halb261"/&gt; Washington became more extroverted in college, so much so that he later said his life could be separated into two parts—his pre-college life and his life after college.&lt;ref name="halb261"/&gt; He has frequently described his college years as "the happiest time in my life."&lt;ref name="Fn150"/&gt; He began dating his future wife Pat when he was a freshman. They met after she noticed him accidentally scoring four consecutive points for the opposing team in a freshman basketball game. She pursued him even though he often remained silent when she spent time with him.&lt;ref name="halb261"/&gt; A lot of the emergence of Washington's personality is credited to Pat, who encouraged him to be more outgoing and overcome his low self-esteem.&lt;ref name="halb262"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 262&lt;/ref&gt; Washington spent a lot of his free time practicing in the gym. He played playground basketball in the summer, and was on several Urban League teams.&lt;ref name="halb262"/&gt; He averaged 19.4 points and 22.3 rebounds on his freshman team at American.&lt;ref name="bref"&gt;[https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/w/washike01.html Kermit Washington], basketball-reference.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Pat helped him with his grades—despite the fact that he had done well his senior year of high school he was still far behind; he did not even know what a paragraph was when he entered college or how to write a report.&lt;ref name="halb263"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

He averaged 18.6 points on 46.8 percent shooting and 20.5 rebounds in his first year of varsity basketball.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; He still played a somewhat unaggressive or "soft" brand of basketball, and it was hurting his chances of being drafted by a professional team.&lt;ref name="halb264"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 264&lt;/ref&gt; Between his sophomore and junior years he began lifting weights with Trey Coleman, a former football player from the [[University of Nebraska]] who was studying as an [[undergrad]] at American.&lt;ref name="halb264"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Coleman encouraged him to be more aggressive on the court, and Washington told him that it was not in his nature. Coleman admonished him, telling him he could not afford to be "cool" on the court given his talent level if he wanted to join the pro ranks.&lt;ref name="halb264"/&gt; Washington was named an academic All-American his junior year. He averaged 21.0 points on 54.4 percent shooting and an [[List of NCAA Division I men's basketball season rebounding leaders|NCAA-leading]] 19.8 rebounds in his junior season.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA"&gt;[http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/m_basketball_RB/2010/D1.pdf 2009–10 NCAA Men's Basketball Records], ncaa.org, accessed November 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He was drafted after his junior season by the [[New York Nets]] of the [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA) and offered a four-year contract for $100,000 a year, which astonished him.&lt;ref name="halb264"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 145&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to stay at American with coach Young for his senior season because he felt he owed the school which had given him a chance when he was coming out of a difficult period in high school.&lt;ref name="halb264"/&gt; He was offered an invite to try for the 1972 [[United States men's national basketball team|Olympic basketball team]] after the season, but did not make the squad.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 147–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington was one of the best players in the country going into his senior season.&lt;ref name="halb265"/&gt; He marveled at newspaper reports in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' that mentioned "coaches of opposing teams and how they were planning to stop ''Kermit Washington''."&lt;ref name="halb265"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 265&lt;/ref&gt; He led the nation in rebounding again in his senior season.&lt;ref name="NCAA"/&gt; He was a [[1973 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|second team All-American]], and helped American into the [[National Invitation Tournament]] (NIT). In the last game of his college career, Washington needed to score 39 points to average 20 points and 20 rebounds a game for his career in college. He became extremely nervous before the game and could neither eat nor sleep.&lt;ref name="Fn150"&gt;Feinstein. pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="halb265"/&gt; The game set American University attendance records, and Washington felt light on his feet when he was introduced before the raucous crowd. He managed to score 40 points and in so doing, became just the seventh player to reach the 20/20 mark.&lt;ref name="halb265"/&gt; He was thrown a party, and there was a campus wide celebration after the game.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. 152&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with a 3.37 [[Grade (education)|GPA]] and a degree in [[sociology]].&lt;ref name="paroxy"&gt;Moore, Matt. [http://www.hardwoodparoxysm.com/2010/07/28/words-on-pages-the-punch-by-john-feinstein/ Words on Pages: "The Punch" by John Feinstein], hardwoodparoxysm.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington was a two-time Academic All-American, who taught courses in social sciences his senior year.&lt;ref name="halb265"/&gt;

==Professional years==
Washington was drafted fifth overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in the [[1973 NBA draft]]. A week before the team began training camp, Pat and Kermit were married. They invited neither of their families; they just drove together to LA's city hall for the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 180&lt;/ref&gt; He had a difficult time making the transition from college center to NBA power forward. In basketball, many players succeed in high school and college due to superior physical skills, but when they arrive in the professional ranks, they are typically going against players that are often as physically gifted as them.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pgs. 265-66&lt;/ref&gt; Washington also had played in a primarily [[zone defense]] system in college and was not versed in [[man-to-man defense]], which is more common in the NBA.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby. pgs. 170–1&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived on a team which had legend [[Jerry West]], who was in the waning stages of a career that would result in him becoming the silhouette seen on the NBA's logo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wolves.nba.com/history/players/west_bio.html Jerry West bio], nba.com, accessed December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington admits that he was terrified of West, and felt anxiety every time he made a mistake in front of him.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Though healthy,&lt;ref name="halb266"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 266&lt;/ref&gt; he played in only 45 games and averaged 8.9 minutes a game his rookie season.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; He hurt his back that year but kept quiet about it, fearing he would be "labeled soft."&lt;ref name="Fn181"&gt;Feinstein. pg. 181&lt;/ref&gt; The injury would bother him the rest of his career.&lt;ref name="Fn181"/&gt; He continued to struggle in his second season, and discovered that finding individual coaching in the professional game at that time was difficult.&lt;ref name="halb266"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 187&lt;/ref&gt; Between the rigorous schedule, and the coaches assuming players already knew how to play for the most part when they entered the league, no one, including head coach [[Bill Sharman]], was willing to work with him on a one-on-one basis.&lt;ref name="halb266"/&gt;

[[File:Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar Lipofsky.jpg|thumb|Los Angeles acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1975. "He was my hero", Washington later said. "It was a dream come true."&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 26–7&lt;/ref&gt; Abdul-Jabbar would later play an important role in the fight that changed Washington's life.]]
Entering his fourth season, Washington knew the only thing keeping him in the league was his guaranteed contract and that the Lakers had essentially written him off.&lt;ref name="halb267"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 182&lt;/ref&gt; The organization felt he had the requisite physical skills, so they ascribed his failure to excel to mental deficiencies.&lt;ref name="halb267"/&gt; Washington was particularly disturbed when in a game against [[Golden State Warriors|Golden State]], he got into an awkward collision with [[Rick Barry]], upon which Barry remarked: "Listen, you better learn how to play this game."&lt;ref name="halb267"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 267&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism especially bothered Washington because he felt Barry's rebuke was correct. Desperate to improve, he contacted [[Pete Newell]] at the recommendation of an agent.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 27–8&lt;/ref&gt; Newell was a retired pro and college coach who worked in a front office position with the Lakers,&lt;ref name="halb268"/&gt; and had drafted Washington when he was then the team's GM.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 25–6&lt;/ref&gt; In truth, while Newell says he felt some responsibility considering he drafted him, he was involved in many player transactions over the course of his long career, and was not especially attached to Washington.&lt;ref name="halb268"/&gt; He was surprised by this request, however, and unhappy with his new highly marginalized job within the organization, so Newell agreed to meet Washington for individual drills.&lt;ref name="halb268"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt; He scheduled the practices very early in the morning to test Washington's dedication, thinking a professional athlete would not bother to get up at that hour every day.&lt;ref name="halb268"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Washington showed up without complaint and Newell put him through intense training sessions.

Newell had Washington watch tapes of [[Paul Silas]], who was a rebounding forward for the [[Boston Celtics]], and convinced him to have more confidence in his offensive game.&lt;ref name="halb269"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 269&lt;/ref&gt; He reworked Washington's game from the ground up, and in so doing established a name for himself as a tremendous coach of big men—he would later conduct a yearly "Big Man Camp" in Hawaii which was attended by hundreds of NBA players.&lt;ref&gt;Bucher, Ric. [http://sports.espn.go.com/magazine/vol4no19bigmancamp.html The Godfather], espn.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Los Angeles had acquired [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], and Washington's style of play complemented him, as Abdul-Jabbar was not an especially physical player.&lt;ref name="halb269"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 38–9&lt;/ref&gt; Washington played well, averaging 9.7 points and 9.3 rebounds;&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; however, he struggled with [[tendinitis]] in his knee the entire season. His wife pleaded with him to sit out some games, but he took painkillers and kept playing.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pgs. 269-70&lt;/ref&gt; Washington finally tore the patella tendon in a late season game against [[Denver Nuggets|Denver]].&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pgs. 270-71&lt;/ref&gt; "I could feel it tearing inside. I looked down, and my kneecap was hanging on the side of my leg."&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Doctors covered his entire leg in a cast and told him his basketball career was most likely over.&lt;ref name="halb271"&gt;Halberstam pg. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

Newell was the person to bring Washington out of the despair Kermit felt when he heard his playing career was probably over. Newell forced him through even more grueling training sessions the following summer, after some of which, Washington strongly considered quitting.&lt;ref name="halbNe"&gt;Halberstam. pgs. 271-72&lt;/ref&gt; His leg had [[atrophy|atrophied]] from the injury and he was scared of re-injuring it during their training sessions. Newell ignored his pleas and told him that if he ever wanted to play again he had to train more than before and work even harder.&lt;ref name="halbNe"/&gt; Washington came back to play the following season and performed well; through the first 25 games he was averaging career highs in points (11.6) and rebounds (10.8).&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; He had been featured in the NBA preview edition of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' (which was dedicated to enforcers that year) before the season and was praised therein for his intimidating nature and fighting skills.&lt;ref name="BS89"&gt;Simmons. pg. 89&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine had posed Washington shirtless in a boxing stance as part of a picture layout entitled, "Nobody, but Nobody, Is Gonna Hurt My Teammates."&lt;ref name="BS89"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papanek, John. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1092961/index.htm 'nobody, But Nobody, Is Going To Hurt My Teammates'], ''Sports Illustrated'', October 31, 1977, accessed December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infamous punch===
On December 9, 1977, during an NBA game between the Lakers and the [[Houston Rockets]], a scuffle broke out between several players at midcourt.&lt;ref name="flak"/&gt;

The events that precipitated the fight have been frequently debated, and variously interpreted.&lt;ref name="flak"/&gt; Two months earlier, on opening night of the season, the Lakers played the [[Milwaukee Bucks]]. Bucks center [[Kent Benson]] elbowed Abdul-Jabbar in the stomach, and Abdul-Jabbar appeared to be in intense pain. Abdul-Jabbar then punched Benson from behind, breaking Benson's jaw and his own hand.&lt;ref name="BS89"/&gt; Washington got into a brawl with several [[Buffalo Braves]] players a few games later.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby. pgs. 171–2&lt;/ref&gt; In the December game, at the beginning of the game's second half, Lakers guard [[Norm Nixon]] missed a shot. Houston's [[Kevin Kunnert]] and Washington both contended for the rebound, which Kunnert eventually got and passed out to teammate [[John Lucas II|John Lucas]]. Their battle for the rebound was more physical than usual, however. Abdul-Jabbar became involved and wrestled with Kunnert. As a result, Kermit Washington stayed behind in the backcourt in order to watch over and make sure nothing happened. After the two disengaged, Washington grabbed Kunnert's shorts in order to prevent him from getting back over on offense quickly. Kunnert threw an elbow that hit Washington on the upper arm and this move spun him around so that he was facing Washington. What happened next is disputed: Washington, several Lakers, and Rocket forward [[Robert Reid (basketball)|Robert Reid]] insisted that Kunnert punched him, Kunnert said Washington swung first after he attempted to free himself from Washington's grasp. The referee who saw the action saw merely a "scuffle" between Kunnert and Abdul-Jabbar followed by the one between Kunnert and Washington then Washington's punch.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 78, 266&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="halb273"/&gt; Both Washington and Abdul-Jabbar reject this account.&lt;ref name="flak"/&gt;

Abdul-Jabbar then ran up behind Kunnert and grabbed his arms to try to pull him away from the scuffle.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OpAzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HeEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=973,5148642&amp;dq=kermit-washington&amp;hl=en Washington Down and Out], ''[[Kentucky New Era]]'', December 10, 1977, accessed November 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; But this only left him defenseless for Washington's first punch, which hit Kunnert in the head and brought him down on one knee.&lt;ref name="BS89"/&gt;

Washington saw Tomjanovich running toward the altercation. Not knowing that he intended to break up the fight, Washington hit Tomjanovich with a short right-hand punch. The blow, which took Tomjanovich by surprise, fractured his face about one-third of an inch (8&amp;nbsp;mm) away from his skull and left Tomjanovich unconscious in a pool of blood in the middle of the arena. Abdul-Jabbar likened the sound of the punch to a melon being dropped onto concrete.&lt;ref name="halb273"&gt;Halberstam. pg 273&lt;/ref&gt; Tomjanovich had a reputation around the league as a peacemaker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1093182/index.htm A Roundup Of The Week Dec. 5-11], ''Sports Illustrated'', December 17, 1977, accessed December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Players involved say that right after Tomjanovich collapsed the absence of sound at the arena, which was filled with shocked fans, was "the loudest silence you have ever heard."&lt;ref&gt;Moore, David Leon. [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/ccovtue.htm New start from old wounds], November 26, 2002, usatoday.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Reporters heard the sound of the punch all the way in the second floor [[press box]], and some rushed to the playing floor in disbelief.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomjanovich was able to get up and walk around, however, and on the way into the locker room he saw Washington. Tomjanovich says that he became aggressive and asked Washington why he punched him. Washington yelled something inaudible about Kunnert, and they were broken up by two security personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs 53–4&lt;/ref&gt; Tomjanovich was in no condition to fight despite his aggressiveness; besides having the bone structure of his face detached from his skull and suffering a cerebral concussion and broken jaw and nose, he was leaking blood and spinal fluid into his skull capsule. His skull was fractured in such a way that Tomjanovich could taste the spinal fluid leaking into his mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIpunch"/&gt; He later recalled that at the time of the incident, he believed the scoreboard had fallen on him.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The doctor who worked on Tomjanovich said "I have seen many people with far less serious injuries not make it," and likened the surgery to [[Scotch Tape|Scotch-taping]] together a badly shattered eggshell.&lt;ref name="halb273"/&gt;

===Aftermath===
Worsening matters for Washington, the only available replay of the incident showed just his punch, not the scuffle that preceded it. This made the attack appear unprovoked,&lt;ref name="BS90"&gt;Simmons. pg. 90&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', then watched by an average of 30 to 35 million people, replayed the punch countless times as a gag, having cast member [[Garrett Morris]] comically defend the punch.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons. pgs. 90, 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 91–2&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the subject of a ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial and investigated on [[CBS News]] by [[Walter Cronkite]].&lt;ref name="SIpunch"&gt;Kirkpatrick, Patrick. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1093209/index.htm Shattered and Shaken], ''Sports Illustrated'', January 2, 1978, accessed December 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington was fined $10,000,&lt;ref name="Daily"&gt;[[United Press International]]. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&amp;dat=19771213&amp;id=gxIsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BscEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3185,2769930 Kermit Washington Draws Stiff Penalty], ''Times Daily'', December 13, 1977, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and suspended for 60 days, missing 26 games; then the [[List of players banned or suspended by the NBA|longest suspension for an on-court incident in NBA history]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everything2.com/title/The+Punch%253A+Kermit+Washington+vs.+Rudy+Tomjanovich The Punch: Kermit Washington vs. Rudy Tomjanovich], everything2.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rockets were furious. Tomjanovich missed the rest of the season and they felt Washington should at least have done likewise.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 219–20&lt;/ref&gt;

On-court fights had been all too common in the 1970s, often including [[bench-clearing brawl]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons. pgs. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; In the season opener, when Abdul-Jabbar punched Benson, no suspension had been levied.&lt;ref name="SIpunch"/&gt; However, Washington's punch resulted in the league enacting strict penalties for on-court fights. Former NBA commissioner [[David Stern]], then the NBA's chief counsel, later said that the incident made NBA officials realize that "you couldn't allow men that big and that strong to go around throwing punches at each other."&lt;ref name="Kahn"/&gt; Currently, any player who throws a punch at another player—even if he misses—is automatically ejected from the game, and suspended for at least his team's next game.&lt;ref name="Kahn"&gt;Kahn, Mike.

Washington received no support from the Lakers front office, aside from a single call the day after the fight from Cooke,&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 82, 92&lt;/ref&gt; and was sent torrents of [[hate mail]] filled with racial epithets.&lt;ref name="cady"&gt;Cady, Steve.

Her obstetrician refused her service because she was Washington's wife,&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 90–1&lt;/ref&gt; and her friends asked her what kind of person Washington was that he could commit such an act.&lt;ref name="halb275"/&gt; The only person who contacted them was Newell. Later in the year Washington went to Newell's home with a big screen television which he insisted Newell accept.&lt;ref name="halb275"&gt;Halberstam. pg. 275&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bob Ryan.JPG|thumb|Bob Ryan wrote a column on Washington in 1978. Ryan later said, "You couldn't not like the guy when you sat down and talked with him...He never wanted to hurt Rudy the way he did...I felt bad for him."&lt;ref name="Fn2256"/&gt; The article endeared Washington to Celtics fans.&lt;ref name="Fn2256"/&gt; The relationship was short-lived, however; he was traded after playing just 32 games for the team.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt;]]

On December 27, 1977, just two weeks after the incident, Washington was traded to the Boston Celtics.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; [[Red Auerbach]], Boston's general manager lived in the Washington, D.C. area, and had been a longtime fan of Washington's.&lt;ref name="halb276"&gt;Halberstam pg. 276&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Pat, stayed behind as the couple had two young children, and Washington would be staying in a hotel.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 222–3&lt;/ref&gt; While he waited for his reinstatement, which he thought would not occur until the next season, he became depressed and fell out of shape.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 220&lt;/ref&gt; He pulled himself together, and began running up and down the flights of stairs of the 29-story hotel.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, [[Jerry West]], who was the Lakers coach at the time, told [[John Feinstein]] he still wanted Washington on the roster. Then-general manager [[Bill Sharman]] said he was "on the fence."&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 92–3&lt;/ref&gt; Cooke, however, decided to move on.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 100–1&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington started alongside Hall of Fame center [[Dave Cowens]], who enjoyed playing with Washington, remarking, "It's great fun, you can always hear him grunt when he's rebounding."&lt;ref name="halb276"/&gt; Auerbach said, "Kermit was fighting a battle he couldn't win. Nothing he could say or do was going to change the way people perceived him because of that moment. I wanted him to feel at home with us, to feel wanted."&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Washington won Boston fans over immediately.&lt;ref name="BS90"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 226&lt;/ref&gt; His acceptance was aided by a glowing article [[Bob Ryan]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him.&lt;ref name="Fn2256"&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 225–6&lt;/ref&gt; After the season, Washington took less money to re-sign with the Celtics over the [[Denver Nuggets]].&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 229–30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
Kunnert signed with Boston before the 1978–79 season even though Washington was on the team because the Celtics offered him the most money.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 247–8&lt;/ref&gt; There remained a mostly quiet discord between the two as Washington felt Kunnert never properly acknowledged his role in the fight.&lt;ref name="halb273"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;[[Associated Press]]. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WbssAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LRMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4969,1342232&amp;dq=kermit-washington&amp;hl=en Washington in Awkward Position], ''[[Star-News]]'', September 7, 1978, accessed November 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington and Kunnert became involved in one of the more unusual player transactions in NBA history. Celtics owner [[Irv Levin]] wanted to move closer to his home, and business interests, in [[California]] but also wanted continue to own an NBA team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/celtics/history/Recap_1970s.html 1970s Boston Celtics history], nba.com/celtics, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; To solve this problem, he and [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]], owner of the [[Buffalo Braves]] NBA team, exchanged franchises.&lt;ref name="halb276"/&gt; Washington and Kunnert were two of four Celtics sent to Buffalo as part of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SDC/1979.html San Diego Clippers], basketballreference.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Levin then moved the Buffalo Braves to San Diego, where they were renamed the [[San Diego Clippers]].

In November 1978, San Diego played in Houston. Tomjanovich scored 26 points and collected 11 rebounds while Washington had six and two.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Before the game, the Clippers coach, [[Gene Shue]], had suggested to the Rockets coach, [[Tom Nissalke]], that the players shake hands at center court prior to tipoff. Tomjanovich rejected the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 249–50&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year in San Diego, Washington was traded again. Levin decided to acquire Portland center [[Bill Walton]] even though Walton had missed the entire [[1978–79 NBA season|1978–79 season]] due to broken bones in his foot. Since the Blazers and Clippers could not agree on compensation, the commissioner's office made the final decision, sending Washington, Kunnert, and [[Randy Smith (basketball)|Randy Smith]] to Portland in exchange for Walton.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; This became the second time Washington and Kunnert were part of the same trade. 

Portland had strongly desired Washington, and their general manager [[Stu Inman]], was a close friend of Pete Newell's. Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington know that they intended this to be the last time he was traded.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pg. 76&lt;/ref&gt; This was important as the media coverage and re-locations had been hard on Pat and the children.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pgs. 76-77&lt;/ref&gt; To his great relief, the city of Portland welcomed Washington with open arms. Portland had one of the more rabid fan bases in the league, and everywhere Washington went he was treated like a beloved celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;Halberstam. pg. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same off-season, Tomjanovich and the Rockets' civil suit vs. the Lakers occurred. Houston's side argued that Los Angeles had failed to control Washington. During the trial, numerous players and coaches who were at the game testified, while Washington sat at the defense table, listening to himself be portrayed as a dangerous rogue.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 265&lt;/ref&gt; Kunnert testified during the trial and contradicted Washington's testimony, angrily branding him a liar.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 266&lt;/ref&gt; While the two were playing for San Diego, their wives became close friends, but their relationship only worsened over time; Washington believed the NBA was keeping Kunnert on his team to prevent him from suing him.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 261&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Ramsay]], Portland's coach, however, said that he chose Kunnert over San Diego center [[Swen Nater]] when his team was asked by the league to submit a list of players they considered fair compensation for Walton.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 260–1&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington shared time at the Trail Blazers power forward spot with [[Maurice Lucas]] at first, but after Lucas' trade to the [[New Jersey Nets]], he became the full-time starter.&lt;ref name="Fn262"&gt;Feinstein. pg. 262&lt;/ref&gt; He played three seasons in Portland, during which he earned a spot in the [[1980 NBA All-Star Game]], after some of the top players sat out due to injury.&lt;ref name="Fn269"/&gt; During that All-Star weekend, which was held in [[Landover, Maryland]], nearby American U. held a halftime ceremony in which they retired Washington's number. He was named a team captain for the following season.&lt;ref name="Fn269"&gt;Feinstein. pg. 269&lt;/ref&gt; In his post-punch career, numerous players, coaches, and officials noted that he became less aggressive on the court out of fear of getting into another fight; something he never did.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 228–9&lt;/ref&gt; Washington started experiencing pain in his back and knees during the [[1980–81 NBA season|1980–81 season]]. The pain became unbearable during the [[1981–82 NBA season|1981–82 season]], and he retired in January 1982 after missing all but 20 games.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt; In 1987, after more than five years out of the league, he tried to make a comeback with the Warriors, but lasted only eight games on the roster (playing in six of them) before being cut.&lt;ref name="bref"/&gt;

==Retirement==
Since retiring, Washington has run restaurants and is a founder and operator of a number of [[charitable organization]]s. He ran a restaurant in the Portland metropolitan area with former Blazer teammate [[Kevin Duckworth]], called "Le Slam." The restaurant closed in 2001.&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Joe Freeman, [http://www.oregonlive.com/nba/index.ssf/2011/03/kermit_washington.html "Ex-NBA Tough Guy Follows Call to Africa,"] ''The Oregonian'', March 23, 2011, pp. D1, D4.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also served in a coaching role with [[Stanford University]], and worked at [[Pete Newell]]'s fabled "Big Man Camp" for 15 years. In 1995, he founded The 6th Man Foundation, otherwise known as Project Contact Africa.&lt;ref name="Syken"&gt;Syken, Bill. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1032489/index.htm#ixzz11t8zrYXC Kermit Washington A onetime NBA pariah delivers medical supplies to an impoverished nation], sportsillustrated.com, July 12, 2004, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1994, Washington accompanied a team of doctors and nurses on a humanitarian mission to [[Goma]], [[Zaire]], working in a [[refugee camp]] helping victims of the bloody [[Rwandan Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt; The stench of death and human waste extended for miles. "It was a sad, sad sight", Washington later recalled, "a sight I'll never forget."&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt;

After his career, Washington has complained of treatment he has received in relation to his punching of Tomjanovich.&lt;ref name="flak"&gt;Wittmershaus, Eric. [http://www.flakmag.com/books/punch.html The Punch], flakmag.com, accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington has sought to portray himself as a victim of the fight and appears to have exaggerated some of the misfortunes that came his way as a result of it. Washington told ''The New York Times'' that he has been refused work as a coach time and again.&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pgs. 335–6&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Tom Davis (basketball, born 1938)|Tom Davis]] hired him as an assistant coach at Stanford, and Davis wanted to bring him to [[University of Iowa|Iowa]] when he went to coach there. Washington stayed at Stanford and later quit his assistant coaching position, and he subsequently worked as strength and conditioning coach for the Portland Trail Blazers.&lt;ref name="Fn336"/&gt;

Washington also claimed that American University cut off contact with him after he punched Tomjanovich. However, this appears to be a misrepresentation of certain events. When he tried to become athletic director of American in 1995, the school offered to hire him as assistant to the athletic director, since Washington had no front office experience. When confronted about this Washington stated: "I didn't see why I couldn't be the AD so they could use my name out front and then have someone with more experience be my assistant."&lt;ref name="Fn336"&gt;Feinstein. pg. 336&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Feinstein]] and others have suggested that the most lasting damage caused by the fight between Washington and Tomjanovich has been to Washington's self-image, and his supposed refusal to accept responsibility for his actions in that fight.&lt;ref name="paroxy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="flak"/&gt; Pat later said it went deeper than that, as when she met him in college:&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein. pg. 142&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It was very hard for him to show affection. Sometimes I would ask him directly if he really cared about me, and he would say something like, "I think you're really nice." It was hard for him to be more open than that. He had never really been nurtured, never really been loved. I came to believe if I nurtured him enough, if I loved him enough, he would get past all that. But I don't believe he ever really did.}}

Washington currently lives in the Washington, D.C. area, where he is employed as a regional representative of the [[National Basketball Players Association]].&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt;

===Crime conviction===
On May 25, 2016, Washington was indicted for allegedly embezzling roughly $500,000 meant for children in Africa.&lt;ref name="indicted"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.freep.com/story/sports/nba/2016/05/25/kermit-washington-arrested/84906648/ |title=Kermit Washington accused of using charity for gain |date=May 25, 2016 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]] |accessdate=May 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 4, 2017, he pled guilty to three counts: one of aggravated identity theft, and two of making a false statement in a tax return. Washington used the charity to [[Money laundering|launder money]] he received as [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]]. Washington, as a regional representative for the [[National Basketball Players Association]], referred NBA players to San Diego attorney Ronald Mix, who then made donations to the charity, but were actually illegal referral payments. Washington then withdrew this money for personal spending. Washington failed to report this money as income on his tax return.&lt;ref name="KCS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rizzo|first1=Tony|title=Washington pleads guilty in KC to African charity fraud|url=http://www.kansascity.com/site-services/legal/copyright/|website=KansasCity.com|publisher=Kansas City Star|accessdate=March 25, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325150137/http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article187923149.html|archivedate=March 25, 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, he was sentenced to six years in federal prison for charity fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Former NBA player Kermit Washington sentenced for charity fraud |url=http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24055695/former-nba-player-kermit-washington-sentenced-charity-fraud |website=ESPN.com |publisher=Associated Press |accessdate=July 10, 2018 |date=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Map of 2018 United States mass shootings}}

This is a '''list of known [[Mass shooting|mass shootings]] that have occurred in the [[United States]] in 2018'''. Mass shootings are incidents involving multiple victims of firearm-related violence. The precise inclusion criteria are disputed, and there is no broadly accepted definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/04/the-squishy-definition-of-mass-shooting-complicates-media-coverage/|title=The squishy definition of ‘mass shooting’ complicates media coverage|last=Borchers|first=Callum|date=October 4, 2017|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 26, 2018|quote=...'mass shooting' is a term without a universally-accepted definition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43004.pdf|title=Public Mass Shootings in the United States|last=Bjelopera|first=Jerome|date=March 18, 2013|website=Congressional Research Service|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-26|quote="There is no broadly agreed-to, specific conceptualization of this issue, so this report uses its own definition for public mass shootings."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{See also|Symbiosis|History of the Internet#Inspiration}}

Man-computer symbiosis is a fundamental or key text of the modern [[computing revolution]].&lt;ref name="Thomas Streeter"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pxAVCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=Man-Computer+Symbiosis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCWoVChMIvdmXlOKZxwIVAjkUCh1WGwLP#v=onepage&amp;q=Man-Computer%20Symbiosis&amp;f=false|author=T. Streeter|title=The Net Effect: Romanticism, Capitalism, and the Internet (p.32-34)|publisher=NYU Press 2011, 219 pages, {{ISBN|0814741169}}, ''Critical Cultural Communication'' |accessdate=2015-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work describes something of Lickliders' [[Visionary|vision]] for a complementary ([[symbiotic]]) relationship between humans and [[computers]] at a potential time of [[the future]]. According to ''Bardini'', Licklider envisioned a future time when [[Artificial intelligence#Goals|machine cognition]] (''cerebration'') would surpass and become independent of human direction, as a basic stage of development within [[human evolution]].  ''Jacucci'' gives the description of Lickliders'  vision as being the ''very tight coupling of human brains and computing machines'' (c.f. ''[[human brain|brain]]'', the term   ''[[Cohesion (computer science)|cohesion]]'' &amp; the general definitions of the term ''[[Coupling (disambiguation)|coupling]]'').&lt;ref name="G. Jacucci"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Bardini - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CEc1OOGmA5IC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Man-Computer+Symbiosis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBWoVChMI9Nvl5NmZxwIVitYUCh2luAde#v=onepage&amp;q=Man-Computer%20Symbiosis&amp;f=false Bootstrapping: Douglas Engelbart, Coevolution, and the Origins of Personal Computing] Stanford University Press 2000, 284 pages, {{ISBN|0804738718}} [Retrieved 2015-08-08]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a necessary ''pre-requisite'' of human-computer symbiosis, Licklider conceived of a thing known as the ''Thinking centre''. Altogether these things were pre-conditions for the development  of [[Computer network|networks]].&lt;ref name="U.V Riss"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W945CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=Thinking+centre+J.C.R.+Licklider&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jrFfI0zfr7&amp;sig=fq16vV0u_mU8o4NHJtjUREEJu90&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAzgKahUKEwiRv5Pj3pnHAhXCaxQKHe-ADQo#v=onepage&amp;q=Thinking%20centre%20J.C.R.%20Licklider&amp;f=false|author=U.V Riss|title=Philosophy, Computing and Information Science|publisher=Routledge 22 Jul 2015, 304 pages, {{ISBN|1317317564}}, ''HISTORY and PHILOSOPHY of Technoscience''|accessdate=2015-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Fuchs-Kittowski - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=agrSBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA436&amp;dq=Man-Computer+Symbiosis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBmoVChMI2oymgN6ZxwIVSUAUCh3jTwaZ#v=onepage&amp;q=Man-Computer%20Symbiosis&amp;f=false Social Informatics: An Information Society for All?

''Streeter'' identifies as the main [[empirical]] element of the work as the [[Time and motion study|time and motion analysis]], which is shown under Part 3 of the work. In addition he identified two reasons for Licklider to have considered such a concept as a ''symbiotic human computer relationship'' at all as beneficial, to be firstly, for it might bring about an advantage  emerging from the use of a computer, such that there are similarities with the necessary methodology of such a use (i.e. ''[[trial and error]]''), to the methodology of [[problem solving]] through [[Play (activity)|play]], and secondarily, because of the advantage which results from using computers in situations of [[battle]].&lt;ref name="Thomas Streeter"/&gt; ''Foster'' states Licklider sought to promote computer use in order to:&lt;ref&gt;I. Foster - [https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0712/0712.2255.pdf ''Human-Machine Symbiosis, 50 Years On''] Computational Institute, Argonne National Laboratory  Department of Computer Science,  University of Chicago [Retrieved 2015-08-12]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''augment human intellect by freeing it from mundane tasks''}}

As his personal motivating force, Streeter considers Licklider to be positing an escape from the limitations of the  mode of computer use during his time, which was [[batch processing]]. Russell thinks Licklider was stimulated by an encounter with the newly developed  [[PDP-1]].&lt;ref name="Thomas Streeter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A.L.

==Parts of the work==
The work shows the following contents:&lt;ref name="MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory"/&gt;

===Part 1===
Part 1 is titled Introduction and has 2 sub-headings, ''Symbiosis'' (part 1.1) and ''Between "Mechanically Extended Man" and "Artificial Intelligence"'' (part 1.2).

Part 1.1 begins by showing a definition of the term [[symbiosis]] using the illustration of the relationship between two organisms, a [[Ficus|fig-tree]], and its [[pollinator]], a type of [[Blastophaga|fig-wasp]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/blastophaga ''Blastophaga''] Merriam-Webster [Retrieved 2015-08-08]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;En-Wei Tian, Hui Yu, Da-Yong Zhang and John D. Nason - [http://www.amjbot.org/content/98/2/e41.full ''Development of microsatellite loci for Blastophaga javana (Agaonidae), the pollinating wasp of Ficus hirta (Moraceae)''] published by ''[[American Journal of Botany]]'' (Am. J. Bot. February 2011 vol. 98 no. 2 e41-e43), ajb.1000432v198/2/e41 (AJB Primer Notes &amp; Protocols in the Plant Sciences) [Retrieved 2015-08-08]&lt;/ref&gt; The article continues to sub-classify the concept of a symbiotic relationship between humans and computers within the larger defined thing which is the relationship between men and [[machines]] generally (''man-machine systems''), and outlines the intentions of its author in the possibility within the future of a relationship for the benefit of [[Thought|human thinking]].

Part 1.2 references  [[John Dudley North|J. D. North]]&lt;ref&gt;J. D. North, "The rational behavior of mechanically extended man", Boulton Paul Aircraft Ltd., Wolverhampton, Eng.; September, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;'s, "The rational behavior of mechanically extended man" to begin a brief discussion on  ''mechanically extended man'' and proceeds to include developments and future developments within [[artificial intelligence]].

===Part 2===
Part 2 is titled ''Aims of Man-Computer Symbiosis''.

===Part 3===
Part 3 is titled ''Need for Computer Participation in Formulative and Real-Time Thinking'' and begins by continuing from a preceding statement on the likelihood of [[Data processing|data-processing]] machines improving human thinking and [[problem solving]]. This part proceeds to an outline of an investigation sub-headed ''A Preliminary and Informal Time-and-Motion Analysis of Technical Thinking'', in which Licklider investigated his own activities during the spring and summer of 1957. This discussion includes  a statement on the currently understood definition of the term [[computer]], as ''a wide class of calculating, data-processing, and information-storage-and-retrieval machines'' (c.f. Information [[Data storage device|storage]] and [[Information retrieval|retrieval]]).Licklider begins a  comparison between the so-called ''[[genotypic]]'' similarities between humans and computers, in the seventh passage of this part, with a definition of [[humans|men]] as:

{{quote|noisy, narrow-band devices, but their nervous systems have very many parallel and simultaneously active channels}}

and ends with the acknowledgement of differences between inherent [[processing speed]] and use of [[language]].

===Part 4===
Part 4 is titled ''Separable Functions of Men and Computers in the Anticipated Symbiotic Association''. Licklider in the first passage of this part makes reference to the [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE System]]. The text continues to identify ways in which theoretically active computers would function in ways including; to [[interpolate]], [[extrapolate]], convert [[Equation|static equations]] or [[logic|logical statements]] into dynamic [[Computer simulation|models]] (see also ''[[Conceptual model (computer science)|conceptual models]]'').The part concludes with a statement of the functioning of a potential computer as performing [[diagnosis]], [[pattern-matching]], and [[Relevance|relevance-recognizing]].

===Part 5===
Part 5 is the final part of the article and is titled ''Prerequisites for Realization of Man-Computer Symbiosis''. It has five sub-headings, ''Speed Mismatch Between Men and Computers, Memory Hardware Requirements, Memory Organization Requirements, The Language Problem'', and ''Input and Output Equipment.''

Part 5.3. mentions the concept of [[Trie|trie memory]] (''[[Edward Fredkin|E. Fredkin]], "Trie memory," Communications of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]], Sept. 1960'').

Part 5.4. begins initially by demonstrating the differences between [[human language]] and [[computer language]], the latter in regards especially to [[FORTRAN]], an  ''Information Processing Language'' identified by J. C. Shaw, A. Newell, H. A. Simon, and T. O. Ellis (in ''A command structure for complex information processing, Proc. [[Western Joint Computer Conference|WJCC]], pp. 119-128; May, 1958''), [[ALGOL]] (''and related systems''), and continues from the second passage from the statement:

{{quote| instructions directed to computers specify courses; instructions-directed to human beings specify goals.}}

particularly  recognising the existence of human [[goal]]s (see also ''[[Goal orientation]]'').

==References of Man-Computer Symbiosis==

'''''Mastotermes darwiniensis''''', [[common names]] '''giant northern termite''' and '''Darwin termite''', is a [[termite]] [[species]] found only in northern [[Australia]]. It is the most primitive termite alive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tolweb.org/Isoptera/8212] Tree of Life Web Project. 2003. Isoptera. Termites. Version 1 January 2003 (temporary). http://tolweb.org/Isoptera/8212/2003.01.01  in The Tree of Life Web Project, http://tolweb.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary significance==
This species shows uncanny similarities to certain [[cockroach]]es, the termites' closest relatives. These similarities include the anal lobe of the wing and the laying of eggs in bunches, rather than singly. It is the only living member of its [[genus]] ''[[Mastotermes]]'' and its [[family (biology)|family]] [[Mastotermitidae]], though numerous [[fossil]] [[taxa]] are known. The termites were traditionally placed in the [[Exopterygota]], but such an indiscriminate treatment makes that group a [[paraphyletic]] grade of [[basal (evolution)|basal]] [[neoptera]]ns. Thus, the cockroaches, termites, and their relatives are nowadays placed in a [[clade]] called the [[Dictyoptera]]. These singular termites appear at first glance like a cockroach's [[Abdomen#Invertebrates|abdomen]] stuck to a termite's fore part. Their wings have the same form as those of the roaches, and its eggs are laid in a case as are roach eggs. It is thought to have evolved from the same ancestors as the wood roaches (''[[Cryptocercus]]'') in the [[Permian]]. Fossil wings have been discovered in the Permian of Kansas which have a close resemblance to wings of ''Mastotermes'' of the Mastotermitidae,&lt;ref&gt;http://tolweb.org/tree?group=Mastotermitidae  Mastotermitidae picture&lt;/ref&gt; which is the most primitive living termite. This fossil is called ''[[Pycnoblattina]]''. It folded its wings in a convex pattern between segments 1a and 2a. ''Mastotermes'' is the only living insect that does the same.&lt;ref&gt;Tilyard RJ (1937) Kansas Permian insects. Part XX the cockroaches, or order Blattaria I, II Am. Journal of Science 34; 169–202, 249–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
Unlike cockroaches, only the reproductives have wings (see [[Termite|Life cycle of termites]]); wings that are considerably longer than their abdomen. Alates are approximately 35&amp;nbsp;mm long with a 50&amp;nbsp;mm wingspan. Soldiers are 11–13&amp;nbsp;mm long and workers are 10–11.5&amp;nbsp;mm long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ozanimals.com/Insect/Giant-Northern-Termite/Mastotermes/darwiniensis.html|title=Giant Northern Termite (Mastotermes darwiniensis)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mastotermes darwiniensis'' is usually not very numerous, nor are the colonies large when left to natural conditions. However, when given abundant water (such as regular irrigation) and favourable food and soil conditions (such as stored timber or timber structures), populations can be enormous, numbering in the millions, quickly destroying their host. Its diet is varied, as it will eat introduced plants, damaged ivory and leather, and wood and debris, and in fact almost anything organic. It becomes a major agricultural pest, to the extent that vegetable farming has been virtually abandoned in Northern Australia&lt;ref&gt;Hill, G.F., (1942) Termites (Isoptera) from the Australian Region. H.E. Daw, Govt. Printer, Melbourne, Austr.&lt;/ref&gt; wherever this termite is numerous, which it is outside of the rain forest or bauxite soils.&lt;ref&gt;Brittan EB et al. (30 authors) (1970) The Insects of Australia. Melbourne University Press. p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; It has developed the ability to bore up into a living tree and ring bark it such that it dies and becomes the center of a colony.

''M. darwiniensis'' is the only known host of the symbiotic protozoan ''[[Mixotricha paradoxa]]'', remarkable for its multiple bacterial symbionts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10388">A '''monstrous birth''', variously defined in history, is a birth in which a [[Congenital abnormality|defect]] of some sort renders the animal or human child [[Monster|monstrous]]. Such births were often taken as [[omen]]s, signs of God, or moral warnings, but besides these supernatural or religious explanations, medical explanations were also given, in which often the mother's state of mind or her sexual behavior was responsible for the [[Deformity|deformed]] fetus. In early and medieval Christianity, monstrous births posed difficult theological problems about humanity and salvation; in the early modern period the interest shifted toward scientific inquiry.

==Overview==
[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Omens (CLIr).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Monstrous births and [[omen]]s in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]''.]]
An early reference to monstrous birth is found in the apocalyptic biblical text [[2 Esdras]], where it is linked to [[menstruation]]: "women in their uncleanness will bear monsters."&lt;ref&gt;Campbell 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Monstrous births are often placed in a religious context and interpreted as signs and symbols, as is evidenced in the 1493 ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]''. According to [[David Hume]]'s [[Four Dissertations|"The Natural History of Religion"]], they are among the first signs that arouse the barbarian's interest.&lt;ref&gt;Buckle 371.&lt;/ref&gt; Monstrous human births raise the question of the difference between humans and animals, and anthropologists have described different interpretations of and behaviors toward such births. Among the East African [[Nuer people]], monstrous births are acted on in a way that restores the division between the categories of human and animal: "the Nuer treat monstrous births as baby hippopotamuses, accidentally born to humans, and, with this labelling, the appropriate action is clear. They gently lay them in the river where they belong."&lt;ref&gt;From a description by [[Mary Douglas]], qtd. in Cockburn 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether monstrous births were natural, unnatural, or supernatural remained a topic of discussion. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] held that nothing "done by the will of God could be contrary to nature," whereas [[Thomas Aquinas]] considered some miracles to be against nature.&lt;ref&gt;Bates 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval explanations===
Reasons for monstrous births given in early medieval [[penitential]]s (concerned with sexual sin) and thirteenth-century medical texts (concerned with physical purity) include pollution through [[menses]] and intercourse during menstruation.&lt;ref&gt;McCracken 63-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Such explanations are found in many medieval literary texts, including Jean Maillart's fourteenth-century ''Roman du Comte Anjou'' and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s "[[Man of Law's Tale]]."&lt;ref&gt;McCracken 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern explanations===
Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century medical texts, which treat [[pregnancy]] as a disease,&lt;ref&gt;Kukla 11.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that monstrous births may be the result of the mother's sickness or distress, and they continue the myth of (bestial) intercourse during pregnancy as a cause.&lt;ref name=kukla13&gt;Kukla 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The mother's role is of the greatest importance, and what was presupposed was the possibility of an emotional transference from mother to fetus, referred to as the "theory of the maternal imagination":&lt;blockquote&gt;According to most of the authors of the sixteenth through early eighteenth centuries, an expectant mother's cravings, desires, and experiences--especially experiences that aroused strong passions such as fear and lust--were capable of ''directly'' inscribing themselves upon the body of the fetus, producing deformities and monstrosities that retained the semantic content of the original impression.&lt;ref name=kukla13/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the same time, an epistemological shift was taking place, and monstrous births changed from "signs to facts." Such births were now often publicized in pamphlets and broadsides and became the subject of scientific investigation; the early sixteenth century produced an "apparent upsurge of interest in monstrous births."&lt;ref&gt;Bates 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal births==
[[File:2HeadsCow.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A two-headed cow.]]
Monstrous animal births often figure in times of religious upheaval. Many occurred in the Europe of the Reformation: the advent of Luther was supposedly announced by the 1522 birth of a monstrous calf (a [[mooncalf]]) in Saxony,&lt;ref name="Smith 355"&gt;Smith 355.&lt;/ref&gt; and the accession of [[Elizabeth I of England]] was supposedly indicated by monstrous births as well, as a warning to "Catholics and other sinners."&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Luther's mooncalf===
A misshapen calf, born in [[Freiberg, Saxony]], on 8 December 1522, quickly became important in the German Reformation. It was born with oddly shaped legs (its hind legs straight as a human's) and with a fold of skin over its head shaped like a [[cowl]]—hence its comparison to a [[monk]]. An illustration made its way to a Prague astrologer, who "discovered that the monster did indeed signify something terrible, indeed the most awful thing possible--Martin Luther."&lt;ref name="Smith 355"/&gt; Luther himself responded quickly with a pamphlet containing a mock [[exegesis]] of the creature, ''Monk Calf'', in which the "Monk Calf" stands, in all its monstrosity, for the Catholic church.&lt;ref&gt;Szabari 132-34.&lt;/ref&gt; Luther's anti-papist pamphlet appeared together with a tract by [[Philipp Melanchthon]]&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 27.&lt;/ref&gt; which discussed a fictional monster, the Pope-Ass, a hybrid between a man and a donkey supposedly found near Rome after the 1496 flood.&lt;ref&gt;Szabari 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Circulated in 1523, Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon's pamphlet was titled ''The Meaning of Two Horrific Figures, the Papal Ass at Rome and the Monk Calf Found at Freyberg in Meissen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Miracles and the Protestant Imagination: The Evangelical Wonder Book in Reformation Germany|last=Soergel|first=Philip|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780199844661|location=|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luca Cranach the Elder and his workshop provided the illustrations of the Papal Ass and the Monk Calf for the pamphlet. Variations of Luther and Melanchthon’s pamphlet eventually were circulated, including one that depicted the Papal Ass and the Monk Calf in “an encounter between the two creatures. This opening page adds a new phrase to the title of the book: ‘with signs of the Day of Judgement.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Monstrous Births and Visual Culture in Sixteenth-Century Germany|last=Spinks|first=Jennifer|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=|location=London|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human births==
[[File:BildniseinesbehindertenMannes.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Sixteenth-century oil painting, [[:de:Bildnis eines behinderten Mannes|''Painting of a handicapped man''.]]]]
Especially monstrous births among humans were, from the early Middle Ages on, seen as signifying God's interaction with the world: "a monstrous birth ''is'' the shape of wickedness, not only the result of original sin but of more local and immediate forms as well."&lt;ref&gt;Crawford 15.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best known examples of such births was the [[Monster of Ravenna]].

Although the connections between a monstrous birth and improper maternal behavior were eventually dismissed by reliable authorities, a particularly late incident involving such allegations took place in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. [[Mary Dyer]], later to become a Quaker martyr, gave birth to a deformed child in October 1637. Noted religious dissenter [[Anne Hutchinson]], who was acquainted with the Dyer family and was present at that birth, was herself delivered of a "monster" in the next year. Both cases were publicized by [[John Winthrop]], who was at the time bringing legal proceedings against both women for heresy.&lt;ref&gt;Schutte 87-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anni Ninna Dewani''' (''née'' '''Hindocha'''; 12 March 1982 – 13 November 2010) was a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] woman of [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian origin]] who was murdered while on her honeymoon in South Africa after the taxi in which she and her husband were travelling was hijacked.

Arrests were made in the days following the crime; hijackers Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni, and hotel receptionist Monde Mbolombo admitted to their involvement in an unintentionally  fatal robbery and kidnapping.&lt;ref name="Bitter Dawn"/&gt; Facing life in prison, Qwabe and Mbolombo later changed their stories to allege the crime had been a premeditated murder for hire at the behest of Anni's husband Shrien Dewani. Taxi driver Zola Tongo initially claimed to be an innocent victim of the incident but, faced with the weight of evidence implicating him in the crime and in the wake of his fellow conspirators' allegations of a "murder for hire" plot, he too changed his story to allege the husband was the instigator.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/17/dewani-murder-doubts-raised-police|title=Dewani murder case: How grieving husband became suspect|last=Morris|first=Steven|date=2011-02-17|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-09|last2=Smith|first2=David|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Smith|first3=Alex Duval}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attractive plea bargains were offered to the conspirators in exchange for future testimony in legal proceedings related to the crime. The allegation of the husband's involvement made global headlines; Shrien Dewani's supporters emphatically denied the accusations, saying it was "ludicrous" to suggest he had solicited an attack on his wife from the first taxi driver he met within hours of their arrival in Cape Town.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; However,    there has also been serious questions asked about Dewanis innocence. For example, why he would take his wife to a dangerous neighbourhood so late at night to 'sightsee' Then the secret meeting between Dewani &amp; Tongo the day after the murder which was caught on hotel surveillance. to 18 years in prison.  Mziwamadoda Qwabe pleaded guilty to murder in August 2012 and was sentenced to 25 years in prison.  Xolile Mngeni was tried and convicted of murder in November 2012 and was sentenced to life in prison. Monde Mbolombo admitted his involvement but was offered immunity in exchange for testimony against the other men alleged to have been involved in the crime.

South African prosecutors formulated charges against Shrien Dewani based on the later-discredited confessions of Tongo, Qwabe and Mbolombo, who were found to have committed [[perjury]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAWCHC/2014/188.html|title=S v Dewani (CC15/2014) [2014] ZAWCHC 188 (8 December 2014)|website=www.saflii.org|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charges were brought on the basis Anni had been the victim of a premeditated kidnapping and murder for hire that was staged to appear as a random carjacking at the alleged behest of her husband. Following a long legal battle, Shrien was extradited from the UK to South Africa to face trial. He was exonerated by a [[Western Cape High Court]], which in December 2014 ruled there was no credible evidence to support the allegations against him nor to support the allegation the crime was a premeditated murder for hire.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Anni Dewani===
The Hindocha family was forced to leave Uganda in the early 1970s after the country's president [[Idi Amin]] [[Expulsion of Asians from Uganda|expelled all Asians living there]]. They were granted residence in Sweden and settled in [[Mariestad]], where their daughter Anni was born and raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8186282/Honeymoon-murder-Anni-Dewani-profile.html |title=Honeymoon murder: Anni Dewani profile |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Marriage===
Anni Hindocha met Shrien Dewani in London in 2009; they maintained a long-distance relationship until Hindocha moved to the UK in March 2010, where they became engaged in May that year.&lt;ref name=gualav&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/08/shrien-dewani-profile-lavish-wedding-high-court-murder-trial-south-africa |title=Shrien Dewani: from lavish wedding to a high court murder trial |work=The Guardian |date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple, whose relationship was sometimes troubled,&lt;ref name=gualav /&gt; married at [[Lake Powai]] near [[Mumbai]], India, on 29 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1141209/jsp/foreign/story_2763.jsp#.Vjq8PWt3mdo |title=Court clears Dewani of honeymoon murder |work=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)]] |date=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were planning to hold a [[civil ceremony]] in the UK in 2011 for friends who could not attend their wedding in India.&lt;ref name=Indp2164391&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/murder-of-anni-dewani-the-bridegrooms-story-2164391.html|title=Murder of Anni Dewani: The bridegroom's story|author=David Connett|work=The Independent|location=London|date=19 December 2010|accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robbery, kidnapping and murder==
{{GeoGroupTemplate}}

After landing at [[Cape Town International Airport]] on 7 November 2010, Dewani and her husband took a domestic flight and stayed at [[Kruger National Park]] for four nights.&lt;ref name=telpro&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8186487/Honeymoon-murder-Shrien-Dewani-profile.html |title=Honeymoon murder: Shrien Dewani profile |work=The Telegraph |date=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 November, the couple returned to Cape Town International Airport, where they met and engaged taxi driver Zola Tongo to drive them to the five-star Cape Grace Hotel.&lt;ref name=Sun3229738&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3229738/Hubby-tells-of-bride-Anni-Dewanis-murder.html|title=Guman said 'we aren't going to hurt you'...

On 13 November, having retained Tongo as a tour guide, the couple were driven through the city in his VW Sharan into Gugulethu. Tongo drove past a BBQ restaurant (Mzolis) and they continued to Surfside Restaurant in Strand, where the couple dined. After their meal, Tongo drove the Dewanis back into Gugulethu. Shortly after turning off the main road, two armed men hijacked the vehicle. After driving a short distance, Tongo was ejected from the taxi. Shrien Dewani was robbed of his money, wallet, designer watch and mobile telephone, and after being driven for about 20 minutes, he was also ejected from the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/taxi-driver-held-over-murder-of-newlywed-in-south-africa-2141122.html |title=Taxi driver held over murder of newly-wed in South Africa |work=The Independent |date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the street, a bystander assisted him by calling the police.

At 07:50 on 14 November, in Lingelethu West, Anni Dewani was found dead in the back of the VW Sharan taxi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/police-hunt-honeymoon-carjack-killers-2134389.html |title=Police hunt honeymoon carjack killers |work=The Independent |date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had suffered a single gunshot wound to her neck.

Anni Dewani's body was taken to a Cape Town hospital.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  The post-mortem examination revealed bruising on her inner leg, indicating she had been involved in a struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAWCHC/2014/188.html |title=S v Dewani (CC15/2014) [2014] ZAWCHC 188 (8 December 2014) |work=[[Southern African Legal Information Institute]] |date=2014}} Sec: "The shooting of the deceased", (24.1.27.2)&lt;/ref&gt; It also indicated she had died from a single gunshot that passed through her hand and neck, severing an artery.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} There was no sign of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Anni-Dewani-not-raped-pathologist-20121010|title=Anni Dewani not raped - pathologist|work=News24|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 November, Dewani's body was released by the South African authorities and returned to the United Kingdom on a [[British Airways]] flight, accompanied by her husband.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  Six months after her death, in a Hindu ceremony, her family scattered her ashes in her favourite area of the [[Vänern]] lake, close to her home town, Mariestad, Sweden.&lt;ref name="Daily_Telegraph_20110516"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/8514888/Anni-Dewanis-ashes-scattered-by-family-as-Shrien-Dewani-fights-extradition.html |title=Anni Dewani's ashes scattered by family as Shrien Dewani fights extradition |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date= 16 May 2011 |author=John Bingham |accessdate=8 December 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation: sequence of arrests and confessions==
As a result of a palm print found on the abandoned taxi, Xolile Mngeni was arrested on Tuesday 16 November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAWCHC/2012/202.html |title=S v Mngeni (CC25/2011) [2012] ZAWCHC 202; 2013 (1) SACR 583 (WCC) |work=SAFLII |date=19 November 2012 |at=INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND, para.12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mngeni made a videotaped confession in the presence of Captain Jonker of the [[South African Police Service]], admitting involvement in a hijack, armed robbery and kidnapping operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Newling |first1=Dan |title=Bitter Dawn |date=2014 |publisher=[[Oneworld Publications|Jonathan Ball Publishers]] |isbn=978-1-86842-624-9 |at=Conflicting Stories (ch.44, sec.3)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described Shrien and Anni Dewani as victims and said Qwabe shot Anni Dewani during a struggle for her handbag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZSc--n2PgQ |title=The Honeymoon Murder: Who Killed Anni? |work=[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]] |time=42:10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mziwamadoda Qwabe was arrested at around 01:00 on Thursday 18 November 2010 as a result of a tip-off from a trusted township informant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Newling |first1=Dan |title=Bitter Dawn |date=2014 |publisher=[[Oneworld Publications|Jonathan Ball Publishers]] |isbn=978-1-86842-624-9 |at=A Second Arrest (ch.10, sec.1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; After initial denials, Qwabe was allowed to consult with arrested co-conspirators Mbolombo and Mngeni, and subsequently admitted involvement in the hijack, armed robbery and kidnapping. He described Shrien and Anni Dewani as victims.&lt;ref name="Bitter Dawn"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Newling |first1=Dan |title=Bitter Dawn |date=2014 |publisher=[[Oneworld Publications|Jonathan Ball Publishers]] |isbn=978-1-86842-624-9 |at=Anatomy of an Accusation (ch.48, sec.1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He changed his story during an interview recorded at 17:21 that day, saying the incident was a murder planned at the behest of Shrien Dewani.&lt;ref name="Bitter Dawn"/&gt;

Monde Mbolombo was arrested in the early hours of Thursday 18 November 2010 as a result of Qwabe providing his name to the police. After initially denying involvement, Mbolombo made a recorded confession at 16:30, admitting arranging a hijacking and armed robbery operation. The confession did not mention a planned murder or Shrien Dewani's involvement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Newling |first1=Dan |title=Bitter Dawn |date=2014 |publisher=[[Oneworld Publications|Jonathan Ball Publishers]] |isbn=978-1-86842-624-9 |at=Anatomy of an Accusation(ch.48, sec.1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Mbolombo changed his story, saying the operation was a planned murder at the behest of Shrien Dewani.&lt;ref name="Bitter Dawn"/&gt;

Taxi driver Zola Tongo reported the hijacking to a police station in Gugulethu after he was ejected from the vehicle, and made a statement saying he was an unknowing victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/documents/why-shrien-dewani-can-go-free--judge-jeanette-trav |title=Why Shrien Dewani can go free - Judge Jeanette Traverso |work=Politicsweb |date=10 December 2014 |at=23.1.29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAWCHC/2010/601.html |title=S v Tongo (SS 59/2010) [2010] ZAWCHC 601 |work=SAFLII |date=5 December 2010 |at=COUNT FOUR: OBSTRUCTING THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 November, Tongo gave a statement to Officer Hendrikse of the SAPS, again saying he was an innocent victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAWCHC/2010/601.html |title=S v Tongo (SS 59/2010) [2010] ZAWCHC 601 |work=SAFLII |date=5 December 2010 |at=COUNT FOUR: OBSTRUCTING THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Tongo appointed attorney William De Grass, and  on Saturday 20 November he surrendered to police and said the operation was a planned murder that was staged to appear as a random hijacking at the behest of Shrien Dewani.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

==Media coverage==
In South Africa, there was much media coverage of the case following the discovery of the body. With an economy reliant on tourism, tour operators reported an immediate drop in bookings as potential visitors became aware of the country's murder rate; on average, 46 per day. There were also concerns the killing would negate the goodwill resulting from the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/a-week-after-honeymoon-brides-murder-what-can-be-the-explosive-revelation-2139734.html|title=A week after honeymoon bride's murder, what can be the 'explosive revelation'?|author=Susie Mesure|work=The Independent|location=London|date=21 November 2010|accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assignment of the [[Police Hawks]] team, and the early arrests, conviction and statement implicating Shrien Dewani led to increased  media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2010-12-21-race-class-and-the-dewani-case|title=Race, class and the Dewani case|author=IMRAAN BUCCUS|publisher=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=21 December 2010|accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/people-news/3997/dewani-denied-his-wife-sex-claims-c4-film|title=Shrien Dewani family welcome 'significant' Panorama findings &amp;#124; Dewani murder News &amp;#124; The Week UK|publisher=Theweek.co.uk|date=2013-09-20|accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/police-investigating-if-shrien-dewani-had-male-lovers-report-118440|title=Police investigating if Shrien Dewani had male lovers: Report|publisher=NDTV.com|date=2011-07-11|accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BBC ''Panorama'' episode ===
An episode of the [[BBC]] television documentary series ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' in March 2012 reported that the original South African post-mortem report showed the bullet that killed Anni Dewani had passed through her left hand followed by her chest, and that the wound on her neck was an exit wound. The report said the bullet left "an irregular gunshot exit wound", which suggested there had been a struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17530411|title=Dewani Couple honeymoon kiss caught on camera |author=Jeremy Vine |publisher=[[BBC News]], Johannesburg |date=29 March 2012 |accessdate=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second ''Panorama'' programme broadcast in September 2013 revisited the case and highlighted numerous inconsistencies between the physical evidence, witness testimony, and the South African prosecutors' purported version of events. In particular it said the forensic evidence had not been collected properly and that it indicated an accidental shooting during a struggle rather than a deliberate killing. In addition, while Tongo's alleged share of the fee for the killing was between a half and a third of his usual monthly salary, the two gunmen made substantially more money from the theft of the Dewanis' belongings than the value of the alleged contract. The programme also showed CCTV evidence that supported the idea a surprise helicopter flight for Anni was being arranged between the taxi driver and the intermediary on behalf of Shrien; this being the reason for the money he changed on the morning of the murder.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Conviction and sentencing of Zola Tongo ===
On 7 December 2010, Zola Tongo appeared in the Western Cape High Court; in accordance with his plea deal under Section 105A of the Criminal Procedure Act, he pleaded guilty to the armed robbery, kidnapping and murder of Anni Dewani—crimes he alleged were committed at the behest of Shrien Dewani.&lt;ref name="saflii.org"/&gt; According to the terms of his Section 105A agreement, Tongo was sentenced to 18 years in prison, contingent on him testifying truthfully against Dewani in any future legal proceedings.&lt;ref name="saflii.org"/&gt;

Tongo was expected to give evidence in the trials of Mngeni and Qwabe in 2011 and 2012. Qwabe avoided trial by pleading guilty pursuant to a Section 105A plea deal. Tongo was not called as a witness at Mngeni’s trial in 2012.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAWCHC/2012/202.html|title=S v Mngeni (CC25/2011) [2012] ZAWCHC 202; 2013 (1) SACR 583 (WCC) (19 November 2012)|website=www.saflii.org|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conviction and sentencing of Mziwamadoda Qwabe===
In pre-trial hearings on 18 February at Wynberg Magistrates Court, counsel for Mziwamadoda Qwabe said the court was unable to provide a fair trial for his client. Thabo Nogemane said, "I am instructed that some unknown police officer assaulted him by means of a big torch. He was hit all over his body. He said the statement was a suggestion put to him by the police. They already had the allegations so they told him: 'Just sign here'. I wouldn't refer to it as a confession, just a statement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laing|first1=Aislinn|title=Anni Dewani murder suspect 'beaten with a torch'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/8332311/Anni-Dewani-murder-suspect-beaten-with-a-torch.html|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the terms of his Section 105A agreement, Qwabe was sentenced to 25 years in prison, contingent on him testifying truthfully in future legal proceedings relating to the case.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Qwabe will be eligible for release in 2027.&lt;ref name=primary /&gt;

===Trial of Xolile Mngeni and surrounding events===

In 2011, Mngeni's lawyer Vusi Tshabalala said his client had been suffocated with a plastic bag before signing a statement admitting his involvement in the killing, further saying police resorted to "irregular methods" because of the pressure they were under to solve the high-profile case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/8332311/Anni-Dewani-murder-suspect-beaten-with-a-torch.html|title=Anni Dewani murder suspect 'beaten with a torch'|author=Aislinn Laing|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=18 February 2011|accessdate=2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The start of Mngeni's trial was delayed, and on 13 June 2011 it was announced he had undergone brain surgery to remove a tumour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-13747990|work=BBC News|title=Dewani honeymoon|date=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having admitted to his role in the robbery and kidnapping of Anni Dewani in a videotaped confession, Mngeni pleaded not guilty at the start of his 2012 trial, saying he had an alibi and was not at the scene of the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://westcapenews.com/?p=5358|title=Prosecution pokes holes in Dewani murder accused defense witness’s testimony {{!}} West Cape News|website=West Cape News|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mngeni’s lawyers said his initial confession should be ruled inadmissible as evidence because it was allegedly extracted using torture. Justice Robert Henney ruled against Mngeni and said the confession was admissible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/75751f804cdbceb9870c87056449a553/Mngenis-confession-admissible-in-court-20122609 |title=SABC News - Mngeni's confession admissible in court |date=26 September 2012|author=SABC|work=sabc.co.za|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before testifying in the Mngeni trial, key witness Monde Mbolombo read out a prepared statement confessing to lying in his two previous affidavits and promised to tell the truth when testifying.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

On 19 November 2012, Mngeni was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in jail. The court accepted Mziwamadoda Qwabe's and Monde Mbolombo's version of events, according to which the crime was a contract killing. Mngeni was ruled to have been the person who shot Anni Dewani.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The court's findings were superseded by the judgement in the later trial of Shrien Dewani, in which the court found the earlier determinations had been made on the basis of flawed forensic evidence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dewani case ballistics expert admits he may have misled trial|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/11181476/Dewani-case-ballistics-expert-admits-he-may-have-misled-trial.html|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and perjury of Qwabe and Mbolombo, the two key witnesses.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Man guilty of shooting Anni Dewani ‘convicted on false evidence’|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/06/man-guilty-shooting-anni-dewani-convicted-false-evidence-shrien-dewani|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limite|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, it was confirmed that a [[medical parole]] application had been made for Mngeni, who was terminally ill with a brain tumour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/10949491/Anni-Dewani-hitman-Xolile-Mngeni-set-for-release-from-prison-on-compassionate-grounds.html |title=Anni Dewani hitman Xolile Mngeni set for release from prison on compassionate grounds |work=The Telegraph |date=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/4ce2bb8044a11ac9a717b769be1f1b5a/Anni-Dewani-killer-applies-for-medical-parole-20140607 |title=Anni Dewani killer applies for medical parole |work=SABC News |date=6 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714105945/http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/4ce2bb8044a11ac9a717b769be1f1b5a/Anni-Dewani-killer-applies-for-medical-parole-20140607 |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was denied parole&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Dewani-killer-denied-medical-parole-20140722 |title=Dewani killer denied medical parole |work=News24 |date=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and died in jail at the [[Goodwood Centre of Excellence]] on 18 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.enca.com/south-africa/anni-dewanis-honeymoon-hitman-dies |title=Anni Dewani's honeymoon hitman dies |work=eNCA |date=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29676084 |title=Anni Dewani murderer dies in South African prison |work=BBC News |date=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/man-who-shot-anni-dewani-dies-1.1767176#.VENR1yKUeyg |title=Man who shot Anni Dewani dies |work=Weekend Argus |date=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extradition and trial of Shrien Dewani===

After a long legal battle, Shrien Dewani was extradited from the United Kingdom to South Africa on 7 April 2014. Upon arrival he was arrested, charged and ordered to stand trial for allegedly arranging the murder of his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Shrien Dewani 'fit to stand trial' for murder of wife in South Africa| url = https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-28801378 |accessdate=15 August 2014| publisher =BBC | work = News |date=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged with five offences; conspiracy to commit kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances, murder, kidnapping and obstructing the administration of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/217006276/Shrien-Dewani-s-Charge-Sheet#scribd|title=Shrien Dewani's Charge Sheet|work=Scribd|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pleaded not guilty to all five charges.

Dewani's trial began on 6 October 2014. Under cross examination, the key witnesses who alleged Dewani's involvement—Zola Tongo, Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Monde Mbolombo—contradicted their previous statements and each other on most of the key elements of the "murder for hire" story. Tongo and Mbolombo were found to have fabricated telephone calls and text messages that did not exist and refused to identify a fifth conspirator referred to in taped recordings. Qwabe refused to explain to the court why Anni was driven into a residential area.&lt;ref name=salii&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAWCHC/2014/188.html |title=S v Dewani (CC15/2014) [2014] ZAWCHC 188 (8 December 2014) |work=[[Southern African Legal Information Institute]] |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 November 2014, after the close of the prosecution's case, Dewani's counsel argued for the case to be dismissed under Section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Act, citing a lack of credible evidence linking his client to the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/17/shrien-dewani-murder-case-dismissal |title=Shrien Dewani’s lawyers apply for murder case dismissal |work=the Guardian |date=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 December, the application for dismissal under Section 174 was granted by the Honourable Judge Traverso; Dewani was acquitted and exonerated of all involvement with the crimes. In her judgement, Traverso ruled there was no credible evidence linking Shrien Dewani to the crime and explained her ruling by saying:

{{quote|Mr. Tongo, who was the only witness who could link the accused to this conspiracy, gave evidence to the court which is so improbable and contains so many mistakes, lies and inconsistencies that one simply cannot know where the lies end and the truth begins. I accept that at this stage of the proceedings the credibility of a witness plays a limited role. But, in my view, the evidence of these witnesses is so replete with fundamental contradictions on the key components of the State case that I can all but ignore it. In making this finding, I take into account that all three witnesses, Mr. Tongo, Mr. Mbolombo and Mr. Qwabe are intelligent people, and therefore more than capable of attempting to twist their version to implicate the accused.&lt;ref name=salii /&gt;}}

The court overturned the finding of Justice Henney in the Mngeni trial, ruling that Xolile Mngeni could not have been the person who shot Anni,&lt;ref name=salii /&gt; and that some of the key conclusions reached in the 2012 Mngeni trial were erroneous, being based on flawed forensic evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/11181476/Dewani-case-ballistics-expert-admits-he-may-have-misled-trial.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Aislinn | last=Laing | title=Dewani case ballistics expert admits he may have misled trial | date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the admitted lies of Monde Mbolombo.&lt;ref name=salii /&gt;  The court also ruled that Monde Mbolombo had again committed perjury and would not be granted indemnity from prosecution. Judge Traverso said, "Before Mr. Mbolombo proceeded with his evidence, he delivered a pre-prepared speech which, from the record, appears to be virtually identical to a similarly emotive speech which he gave the court in the Mngeni trial, before blatantly lying about material aspects."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Monde Mbolombo===
Monde Mbolombo has not been prosecuted or punished for his self-confessed role in the crime, nor for his self-confessed perjury whilst testifying. On 19 November 2015 the Director of Public Prosecutions decided Mbolombo could not be prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Key witness in Dewani case granted indemnity {{!}} eNCA|url = http://www.enca.com/south-africa/key-witness-dewani-case-granted-indemnity|website = www.enca.com|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complaint about judicial conduct==
On 22 January 2015, a complaint was lodged by the Higher Education Transformation Network (HETN), alleging judicial bias and prejudiced behaviour of Judge Traverso in the trial of Shrien Dewani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Complaint-lodged-against-Judge-Traverso-20150122|title=Complaint lodged against Judge Traverso|work=News24|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 April that year, a Judicial Conduct Committee dismissed the HETN's complaint, describing it as "frivolous" and lacking in substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Dewani judge complaints 'frivolous' - Crime &amp; Courts {{!}} IOL News|url = http://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/dewani-judge-complaints-frivolous-1.1850412#.VUVF0SFVikp|work= Independent Online| author=Fatima Schroeder| date=25 April 2015 |accessdate=4 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Dewani judge cleared of bias claims|url = http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Dewani-judge-cleared-of-bias-claims-20150424| work=News24.com |author=Thomas Hartleb |date=24 April 2015 |accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Prosecuting Authority]] declined to appeal the judgement or lodge any complaint against Judge Traverso.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vocfm.co.za/npa-respects-dewani-ruling/|title=NPA respects Dewani ruling  {{!}} Voice of the Cape|date=2014-12-08|work=Voice of the Cape|access-date=2017-09-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coroner's inquest==
After Shrien Dewani's exoneration in December 2014, Anni Dewani's family asked for a [[coroner's court]] in the UK to reopen the inquest into her death and to compel Dewani to publicly answer questions. On 9 September 2015, at Brent Coroner's Court in North London, Coroner Andrew Walker said he did not consider a full inquest was appropriate because a criminal trial had been conducted in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1549469/murdered-anni-dewani-no-full-inquest|title=Dewani Family 'Fight On' Despite Inquest Blow|work=Sky News|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/09/anni-dewani-death-coroner-questions-uk-inquest-hindocha-shrien|title=Anni Dewani death: coroner questions need for UK inquest|work=the Guardian|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 October, Walker confirmed there was insufficient cause to resume an inquest. He told the court he was prohibited from reaching a conclusion that was inconsistent with the findings of the South African courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/09/anni-dewani-inquest-will-not-continue-coroner-rules|title=Anni Dewani inquest will not continue without new evidence, coroner rules|last=Association|first=Press|date=2015-10-09|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-09-09|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hindocha family statement==

On 4 August 2018, Anni Hindocha's uncle, acting as spokesperson for the Hindocha family in response to media reports of Shrien Dewani's same-sex relationship, said "We accept he did not murder Anni, but he lied to us and had a very secret gay life. He owes us an apology for his lies".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/shrien-dewani-appears-new-boyfriend-1859715&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Aaby''' ([[Danes|Danish]], born 1944 in [[Lund]], [[Sweden]]) is trained as an [[anthropologist]] but also holds a [[doctoral degree]] in [[medicine]].&lt;ref name="Winkel, 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winkel|first1=Klaus|title=Danskere i tropisk Afrika : fra slavehandler til bistandsarbejder|date=2011|publisher=Klim|location=Århus|isbn=8779559271|edition=1. udgave.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, Peter Aaby established the [[Bandim Health Project]], a Health and Demographic Surveillance System site in [[Guinea-Bissau]] in [[West Africa]], which he has run ever since.&lt;ref name="Bandim, 2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Background|url=http://bandim.org/about-bhp/background.aspx|website=Bandim Health Project|publisher=SSI|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Peter Aaby was awarded the [[Novo Nordisk]] Prize, the most important Danish award within [[Outline of health sciences|health research]].

Aaby is credited for the discovery of [[non-specific effect of vaccines|non-specific effects of vaccines]] – i.e. effects of [[vaccine]]s, which go beyond the specific protective effects against the targeted diseases.&lt;ref name="Prentice, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prentice|first1=AM|last2=Savy|first2=M|last3=Darboe|first3=MK|last4=Moore|first4=SE|title=Commentary: Challenging public health orthodoxies--prophesy or heresy?|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|date=April 2009|volume=38|issue=2|pages=591–3|pmid=19174540|url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/2/591.short|doi=10.1093/ije/dyn363|pmc=2663722}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of non-specific effects of vaccines was established in 1991 and later documented in several trials on [[measles vaccine]], [[BCG vaccine|BCG]], [[oral polio vaccine]], [[DTP vaccine]] and [[smallpox vaccine]].&lt;ref name="Benn, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benn|first1=CS|last2=Netea|first2=MG|last3=Selin|first3=LK|last4=Aaby|first4=P|title=A small jab - a big effect: nonspecific immunomodulation by vaccines.|journal=Trends in Immunology|date=September 2013|volume=34|issue=9|pages=431–9|pmid=23680130|doi=10.1016/j.it.2013.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of Aaby’s work on non-specific effects of vaccines it has been recommended the WHO [[vaccination program]] in [[low income countries]] should be changed.&lt;ref name="Shann, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shann|first1=F|title=Nonspecific effects of vaccines and the reduction of mortality in children.|journal=Clinical Therapeutics|date=February 2013|volume=35|issue=2|pages=109–14|pmid=23375475|doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2013.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[WHO]] recently reviewed the evidence for non-specific effects of BCG vaccine, measles vaccine and DTP vaccine, and concluded that it would "keep a watch on the evidence of nonspecific effects of vaccination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Meeting of Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, 18-19 June 2008|pmid=18689006 | volume=83 |issue=32 | date=Aug 2008|journal=Wkly Epidemiol Rec|pages=287–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Philosophical Inquiries into the Essence of Human Freedom''''' ({{lang-de|Philosophische Untersuchungen über das Wesen der menschlichen Freiheit und die damit zusammenhängenden Gegenstände}}) is an 1809 work by [[Friedrich Schelling]]. It was the last book he finished in his lifetime, running to some 90 pages of a single long essay. It is commonly referred to as his "''Freiheitsschrift''" (freedom text) or "freedom essay".

Described by [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] as "the most titanic work of German idealism",&lt;ref&gt;John Laughland, ''Schelling Versus Hegel: From German Idealism to Christian Metaphysics'' (2007), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; it is also seen as anticipating much of the collection of basic [[Existentialism|existentialist]] motifs. Its ambitions were high: to tackle the problem of [[radical evil]], and to innovate at a metaphysical level, in particular to correct [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]. As its title suggests, it intends to give an account of [[human freedom]], and the requirements on the philosophical side to protect this idea from particular formulations, at issue during the period, of [[determinism]].

==Influences on Schelling==

The literature on the history of philosophy contains many assertions about the general influences on Schelling. There are also more specific comments about other thinkers and traditions that had a definite effect on this transitional work. The opening pages make it clear that Schelling is engaged in arguing against [[Spinozism]], a position which (often simply called "dogmatism") had been a target for both philosophical and religious thinkers in Germany for decades. Schelling was not concerned about rejecting all that [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s thought implied, in the terms of that debate, but to salvage something from the unification of view ([[monism]]) that came with it, while allowing room for freedom.

At this time Schelling was influenced also by [[Franz Xaver von Baader]] and the writings of [[Jakob Böhme]]. In fact ''Of Human Freedom'' contains explicit references to Baader's doctrine of [[evil]], and Böhme's schematic creation myths, and uses the term [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]; a detailed mapping of Böhme's thought onto Schelling's argument in the ''Freiheitsschrift'' has been carried out by Paola Mayer.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer pp. 197-209.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand Robert Schneider and Ernst Benz have argued for the more direct influence of the pietist [[Johann Albrecht Bengel]] and theosophist [[Friedrich Christoph Oetinger]].&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Alexander Magee (2001), ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition'', pp. 79-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

Explicit concerns of Schelling in the book are: the existence of evil and the emergence into reason. Schelling offers a solution to the first, an old theological chestnut, in brief that “evil makes arbitrary choice possible”. On the other hand, by no means all interpretations of the work come from the direction of theology and the [[problem of evil]]. The second idea, requiring a rationale of [[emergence]], was more innovative, because of the place it gave to [[irrationalism]] and [[anthropomorphism]], within the "cosmic" setting (which need not be taken literally). The work stands also in relation to a decade of previous publications, formulations, and rivalries.

A view from the nineteenth century is that of [[Harald Høffding]] (who sets the book in the context of a supposed personal crisis and philosophical block):

{{cquote|... [Schelling] attempts to show that we are only justified in conceiving God as a personal being if we posit an original antithesis within the absolute, within the essence of the Deity,&amp;mdash;a dark irrational ground which becomes purified and harmonised ... in the course of the life-development of the Divine Being. [...] All evil consists in a striving to return to the chaos out of which the order of Nature has proceeded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harald Høffding]], ''History of Modern Philosophy'' (1900 translation), vol. II p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Modern readings of Schelling's intentions can differ quite widely from this interpretation (and each other). This writing of Schelling is also seen as the beginning of his critique of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], and an announcement of a transitional moment in philosophy; part of the purpose was self-justification, verging on polemic in defence of Schelling's [[panentheism]]. It is therefore a signpost marking a fork in the road for what is now called "classical German philosophy": even if it had its time of dominance, [[absolute idealism]] in Hegel's sense is (after the "freedom essay") just one branch of the discussion of the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] in [[German idealism]]. Hegel became a system-builder while Schelling produced no systematic or finished philosophy in three decades after the ''Freiheitsschrift''.

===Evil as radical===

The conception of evil is set against both the [[Neoplatonic]] ''[[privatio boni]]'' and the [[Manichaean]] division into two disconnected and contending powers. Evil must be seen as active, in both God and natural creatures. There is a distinction: in God evil can never stray out of its place (at the base), while in man it certainly may exceed its role of basing self-hood.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer pp. 198-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Slavoj Žižek]] writes that the central tenet is that

{{cquote|...if one is to account for the possibility of Evil, one has to presuppose a split in the Absolute into God insofar as he fully exists, and the obscure, impenetrable Ground of his Existence.&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Žižek, ''The Abyss of Freedom'' p. 5, in ''The Abyss of Freedom/Ages of the World'' (1997) (with Judith Norman, translator)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John W. Cooper writes

{{cquote|Either Evil is unreal or God is its cause. Schelling's solution to this perennial problem is to view God's freedom as the possibility of evil and human freedom as responsible for the actuality of evil.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Cooper, ''Panentheism: The Other God of the Philosophers'' (2006), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Spinoza and pantheism===

At the time of writing the ''Freiheitschrift'', Schelling had on his mind an accusation of [[pantheism]], levelled at him by [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] in ''Über Sprache und Weisheit der Indier'' (1808).&lt;ref&gt;Mayer p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[Pantheism controversy]] of the 1780s continued to cast a long shadow. [[F. H. Jacobi]], who had launched it, was someone with whom Schelling was in contact in [[Munich]], where the book was written.

In his book, Schelling takes up the issue of pantheism, concerned to refute the idea that it necessarily leads to [[fatalism]], so negating human freedom. Here he is closer to Spinoza, erasing the distinction between nature and God. On the other hand, Schelling is trying to overcome the distinction made in Spinoza's system, between ''[[natura naturans]]'' (dynamic) and ''[[natura naturata]]'' (passive). Schelling wanted to locate the fatalism in Spinoza, not in the pantheism or monism, but in his formulation.&lt;ref name = Hedley&gt;Douglas Hedley, ''Coleridge, philosophy and religion: Aids to reflection and the mirror of the spirit'' (2000), pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthesis claimed===

According to Andrew Bowie:

{{cquote|The central issue in ''FS'' is ... a non-reductionist account of the relationship of thinking to being. Spinoza's system ... is seen as 'one-sidedly realistic' (in the sense of 'materialist'), and as in need of completion by an 'ideal' aspect in which 'freedom reigns'.&lt;ref&gt;Bowie, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schelling considered that the idealist conception of freedom, in [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], had remained undeveloped, absent a cleaner break with the rationalist systems of Spinoza and [[Gottfried Leibniz]], and a distinctive theory of its human element.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Francois Courtine]], ''Schelling'', p. 86-87 in Simon Critchley, William Ralph Schroeder (editors), ''A Companion to Continental Philosophy'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; In another view of the book's main theme, leading onto the further development of the philosophy of the ''[[Weltalter]]'' (Ages of the World), Schelling

{{cquote|...sought to grasp the dynamic differentiation in God and hence the temporal quality of the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Dallmayr, ''Heidegger on Ethics and Justice'', p. 194 in Arleen B. Dallery, Stephen H. Watson, E. Marya Bower (editors), ''Transitions in Continental Philosophy'' (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this approach, the Absolute takes on a darker side, and shows therefore the connection to the theme of the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Günther Zöller, ''German realism: the self-limitation of idealist thinking in Fichte, Schelling and Schopenhauer'', p. 209, in [[Karl Ameriks]] (editor), ''The Cambridge Companion to German Idealism'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; This aspect then pervades all life:

{{cquote|The duality of (blind) nature and (enlightened) existence is not limited to God's original self-construction. It is said to permeate all of creation, which thus repeats on a finite scale the divine process of self-realization from will to reason. In finite individuals the dark, blind will manifests itself as particular will as stands in opposition to the enlightened or universal will.&lt;ref&gt;Zöller in ''Cambridge Companion'', p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Summary==

This is an approximate summary of the content of the ''Freiheitsschrift'' using page numbering as appears in Schelling's ''Works''.&lt;ref&gt;These numbers are shown in the Gutmann translation in the margin, and a German text in the original numbering is available as a [http://www.dalank.de/archiv/freiheit.pdf PDF].&lt;/ref&gt; There is no division except into paragraphs.

*336-8 There is a traditional view that system excludes individual freedom; but on the contrary it does have "a place in the universe". This is a problem to solve.
*338-343 Reformulation as the issue of pantheism and fatalism.
*343-8 Spinoza and Leibniz.
*348 German idealism versus French atheistic mechanism; Fichte's ''Wissenschaftslehre''.
*349-352 It is a mistake to believe that idealism has simply displaced pantheism.
*352-355 The real conception of freedom is the possibility of good and evil.
*356-357 Critique of the abstract conception of God; ''Naturphilosophie''.
*357-358 Ground of God and light.
*359-366 Critique of immanence.
*366-373 Conception of evil according to Baader.
*373-376 Evil is necessary for God's revelation; exegesis of "matter" in Plato.

*402 God brought forward order from chaos.
*403 History is incomprehensible without a concept of a humanly suffering God.

==A debated transition==

Schelling placed the ''Freiheitsschrift'' at the end of the first volume of his ''Sämmtliche Werke'' (Collected Works). The correct periodisation of his philosophy is still a contentious area, and there are differing views of what kind of punctuation mark it really represents in Schelling's work. It is admittedly important that the book itself begins with an outright rejection of “system”.&lt;ref&gt;David Walsh, ''The Modern Philosophical Revolution: The Luminosity of Existence'' (2008), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of this book is said, on the one hand, to mark the beginning of Schelling's “middle period”.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schelling/#3&lt;/ref&gt; As such it marks the break with the “identity philosophy” on which he worked in the first decade of the nineteenth century, after his beginnings as a follower of [[Johann Fichte]] and developer of ''[[Naturphilosophie]]''.

The divergence of Schelling and Hegel becomes clear from around this year, with Hegel's ambitions being systematic and explicitly encyclopedic, notions of freedom being quite different, and the use of dialectic becoming obviously distinct on the two sides. Hegel's star was in the ascendent, while Schelling's other road led into the wilderness, at least as far as academic respectability was concerned. Academic recognition for Schelling's work as important to philosophy, as opposed to an idiosyncratic contribution to [[philosophy of religion]], was indeed slow to come. [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], one of Schelling's contemporaries and followers, rated it highly.&lt;ref name = Hedley/&gt;

In 1936, [[Martin Heidegger]] gave a series of lectures on Schelling's freedom essay. These were published in German in 1971 and translated into English in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;M. Heidegger, ''Schellings Abhandlung über das Wesen der menschlichen Freiheit'', Tubingen, Max Niemeyer Verlag, 1971 

Translation by Joan Stambaugh as ''Schelling's Treatise on the Essence of Human Freedom'', Athens, Ohio University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger largely treated the ''Freiheitschrift'' as continuous with the "identity philosophy" period leading up to it.&lt;ref&gt;Kyriaki Goudeli, ''Challenges to German Idealism: Schelling, Fichte and Kant'' (2002), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Heidegger by 1941 had hardened his line to the position that Schelling is still a theorist of an enclosing [[subjectivity]], while treating the ''Freiheitsschrift'' as the apex (''Gipfel'') of the metaphysics of German idealism. This view is still contested: other authors read the book as the start of something new in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Bowie p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Schelling's ''Stuttgart Vorlesungen'' of 1810 reformulate and build on the freedom essay, and the ''Weltalter'' manuscripts go further in trying to work out details of the Behmenist insights.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate is therefore really whether the ''Freiheitschrift'' is culminating, seminal, or possibly both.

'''Pleistocene rewilding''' is the advocacy of the reintroduction of descendants of [[Pleistocene megafauna]], or their close ecological equivalents. An extension of the conservation practice of [[rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]], which involves reintroducing species to areas where they became extinct in recent history (hundreds of years ago or less).&lt;ref name="Rubenstein"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rubenstein |first1=D.R. |author2=D.I.

Towards the end of the [[Pleistocene]] era (roughly 13,000 to 10,000 years ago), nearly all megafauna of Eurasia, Australia, and South/North America, dwindled towards [[Pleistocene extinction|extinction]], in what has been referred to as the [[Quaternary extinction event]]. With the loss of large herbivores and predator species, [[Ecological niche|niches]] important for ecosystem functioning were left unoccupied.&lt;ref name="Janzen"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Neotropical Anachronisms: The Fruits the Gomphotheres Ate |journal=Science|date=1982-01-01|first1=Daniel H.|last1=Janzen|author2=Paul S.

== Ecological and evolutionary implications ==

Research shows that species interactions play a pivotal role in conservation efforts.

== Possible fauna for reintroduction (North America) ==
[[File:Itzelbolson1small.jpg|thumb|right|The Bolson tortoise, the first proposed candidate for Pleistocene rewilding]]
Pleistocene rewilding aims at the promotion of extant fauna and the reintroduction of extinct genera in the southwestern and central [[United States]]. Native fauna are the first genera proposed for reintroduction. The [[Bolson tortoise]] was widespread during the Pleistocene era, and continued to be common during the [[Holocene]] epoch until recent times. Its reintroduction from northern [[Mexico]] would be a necessary step to recreate the soil humidity present in the Pleistocene, which would support [[grassland]] and extant [[scrubland|shrub-land]] and provide the habitat required for the herbivores set for reintroduction. Other large tortoise species might later be introduced to fill the roll of various species of [[Hesperotestudo]]. However, to be successful, ecologists must first support fauna already present in the region.

The [[pronghorn]], which is extant in most of the west after almost becoming extinct, is crucial to the revival of the ancient ecosystem. Pronghorns are native to the region, which once supported large numbers of the species and extinct relatives of the same family. It would occupy the great plains and other arid regions of the west and southwest.

The [[plains bison]] numbered in the millions during the Pleistocene and most of the Holocene, until European settlers drove them to near-extinction in the late 19th century. The bison has made a recovery in many regions of its former range, and is involved in several local rewilding projects across the [[Midwestern United States]].

[[Bighorn sheep]] and [[mountain goat]]s are already present in the surrounding mountainous areas and therefore should not pose a problem in rewilding more mountainous areas. Mountain goats are already being introduced to areas formerly occupied by [[Harrington's mountain goat|Oreamnos haringtoni]], a more southern relative that went extinct at the end of the Pleistocene. Reintroducing extant species of deer to the more forested areas of the region would be beneficial for the ecosystems they occupy, providing rich nutrients for the forested regions and helping to maintain them. These species include [[elk]], [[white-tailed deer|white-tailed]] and [[mule deer]].

Herbivorous species considered beneficial for the regional ecosystems include the [[collared peccary]], a species of New World wild pig that was abundant in the Pleistocene. Although this species (along with the [[Platygonus|flat-headed]] and long-nosed peccaries) are extinct in many regions of North America, their relatives survive in Central and South America and the collared peccary can still be found in southern [[Arizona]] and [[Texas]]. The [[Chacoan peccary]], which is morphologically very similar to the flat-headed peccary, might be able to replace it in areas of the Great Plains and the South.

Horses originated in North America and spread to Asia via the Ice Age land bridge, but became extinct in their evolutionary homeland alongside the [[mammoth]] and [[ground sloth]]. The Pleistocene grasslands of North America were the birthplace of the modern horse, and by extension the [[wild horse]]. [[Przewalski's horse]]s are well adapted to arid and grassland regions and could be introduced as a substitute for their close North American relative, [[Equus scotti|Scott's horse]]. The stilt-legged horses might be approximated by the morphologically similar [[onager]]s, [[kiang]]s, and [[African wild ass|asses]]. Animals that would serve as predators of these equine species would include [[lion]]s and [[wolves]].&lt;ref name="m305"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mech|Boitani|2003|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside the wild horse, camels evolved in the drier regions of North America. Although camelids are extinct in North America, they have survived in South America until today: the [[guanaco]] and [[vicuña]], and the domesticated [[llama]] and [[alpaca]]. North America links the South American camelids with those of the Old World (the [[dromedary]], [[Bactrian camel]] and [[wild Bactrian camel]]). Pleistocene rewilding suggests that the closest relatives of the North American species of camelid be reintroduced. The best candidates would be the wild Bactrian as a proxy for [[Camelops]], the guanaco as a proxy for [[Hemiauchenia]], and possibly the Vicuña as a proxy for [[Palaeolama]]. These species would live in the arid regions and grasslands of North America. Free-ranging camels face predators typical of their regional distribution, which include [[wolves]] and [[lion]]s.&lt;ref name="ngNews"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chambers |first1=Delaney |title=150-year-old Diorama Surprises Scientists With Human Remains |date=29 January 2017 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/01/taxidermy-carnegie-museum-skull/ |website=news.nationalgeographic.com |publisher=National Geographic |accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main predator of guanacos and vicuñas is the [[cougar]].&lt;ref&gt;Busch, Robert H. ''The Cougar Almanac.'' New York, 2000, pg 94. {{ISBN|1592282954}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tapirus pinchaque portrait.jpg|thumb|right|The mountain tapir]]
During the Pleistocene, a species of [[tapir]] existed in North America with many regional variants. They became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene era, but their relatives survive in Asia and South America. The [[mountain tapir]] would be an excellent choice for rewilding humid areas, such as those near lakes and rivers. The mountain tapir is the only extant non-tropical species of tapir. [[Predator]]s of mountain tapirs include [[cougar]]s, [[bear]]s, and, less commonly, [[jaguar]]s.&lt;ref name=Padilla2010&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2010 | title = Tapirus pinchaque (Perissodactyla: Tapiridae) | journal = Mammalian Species | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | url = https://academic.oup.com/mspecies/article-pdf/42/863/166/8269111/42-863-166.pdf | pages = 166–182 | doi = 10.1644/863.1 | last1 = Padilla | first1 = Miguel | last2 = Dowler | first2 = Robert C. | last3 = Downer | first3 = Craig C. | displayauthors = 1 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Good introduction areas might include forested ecosystems of the west and east coasts, and the more scrub-like or wetland ecosystem of the south.

During the Pleistocene, large populations of [[Proboscidea]]ns lived in North America, such as the [[Columbian mammoth]] and the [[American mastodon]]. The [[mastodon]]s all became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene era, as did the mammoths of North America. However, an extant relative of the mammoth is the [[Asian elephant]]. It now resides only in tropical southeastern Asia, but the fossil record shows that it was much more widespread, living in temperate northern China as well as the Middle East (an area bearing an ecological similarity to the southern and central United States). The Asian elephant is possibly a good candidate for Pleistocene rewilding in North America. Asian elephants would do well in the environments previously occupied by the Columbian mammoth. [[African elephant]]s have also been suggested for introduction into North America.

Pleistocene America boasted a wide variety of dangerous carnivores (most of which are extinct today), such as the [[short-faced bear]], [[saber-toothed cat]]s (e.g. [[Homotherium]]), the [[American lion]], [[dire wolf]], and the [[American cheetah]]. Some carnivores and omnivores survived the end of the Pleistocene era and were widespread in North America until Europeans arrived, such as [[grizzly bear]]s, [[cougar]]s, [[jaguar]]s, [[grey wolf|grey]] and [[red wolf|red wolves]], [[bobcat]]s, and [[coyote]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservationmagazine.org/2008/07/where-the-wild-things-were/ ''Conservation Magazine'', July 2008] Retrieved 2011-05-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cheetah]] could serve as a substitute for ''[[American cheetah|Miracinonyx]]'', keeping the population of pronghorns in check. [[Jaguars]] could be reintroduced back to areas of North America to control populations of prey animals. Some of the larger cats such as the [[African lion]] could act as a proxy for the Pleistocene [[American lion]], they could be introduced to keep the numbers of [[American bison]], equids, and camelids in check.

== Criticism ==
The main criticism of the Pleistocene rewilding is that it is unrealistic to assume that communities today are functionally similar to their state 10,000 years ago. Opponents argue that there has been more than enough time for communities to evolve in the absence of mega-fauna, and thus the reintroduction of large mammals could thwart ecosystem dynamics and possibly cause collapse. Under this argument, the prospective taxa for reintroduction are considered exotic and could potentially harm natives of North America through invasion, disease, or other factors.&lt;ref name="Rubenstein"/&gt;

Opponents of the Pleistocene rewilding present an alternative conservation program, in which more recent North American natives will be reintroduced into parts of their native ranges where they became extinct during historical times.&lt;ref name="Rubenstein"/&gt; Another way of rewilding Americas, Asia, etc. is by using [[de-extinction]], bringing extinct species back to life through cloning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/deextinction|title=De-Extinction|date=15 March 2015|work=nationalgeographic.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513035532/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/deextinction/|archivedate=13 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pleistocene rewilding in Europe ==
This plan was considered by Josh Donlan and Jens-C. Svenning, and involves (as in rewilding North America) creating a Pleistocene habitat in portions of Europe.[12] Svenning claims that "Pleistocene Rewilding can be taken for consideration outside of North America". Incidentally, an independent "Rewilding Europe" initiative was established in the Netherlands in 2011, with the western Iberian Peninsula, Velebit, the Danube delta and the eastern and southern Carpathians as particular targets.[13]

The proxies which may be used for this project(s) are:

=== Animals which have already been introduced ===

==Northern Siberia==
The aim of Siberian Pleistocene rewilding is to recreate the ancient [[mammoth steppe]] by reintroducing megafauna. The first step was the successful reintroduction of musk oxen on the [[Taymyr Peninsula]] and [[Wrangel island]]. In 1988, researcher [[Sergey Zimov]] created [[Pleistocene Park]] – a nature reserve in northeastern Siberia for full-scale megafauna rewilding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pleistocenepark.ru/en/|title=Pleistocene Park: Restoration of the Mammoth Steppe Ecosystem|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reindeer, [[Siberian roe deer]] and moose were already present; [[Yakutian horse]]s, muskox, [[Altai wapiti]] and [[wisent]] were reintroduced. Reintroduction is also planned for [[yak]], [[Bactrian camel]]s, [[snow sheep]], [[Saiga antelope]], and [[Siberian tiger]]s.

The wood bison, the closest relative of the ancient bison which became extinct in Siberia 1,000 to 2,000 years ago, is an important species for the ecology of Siberia. In 2006, 30 bison calves were flown from [[Edmonton, Alberta]] to [[Yakutsk]]. Now they live in the government-run Ust'-Buotama reserve.

== Island landmasses ==
Megafauna that arose on insular landmasses were especially vulnerable to human influence because they evolved in isolation from other landmasses, and thus were not subjected to the same selection pressures that surviving fauna were subject to, and many forms of insular megafauna were wiped out after the arrival of humans. Therefore, scientists have suggested introducing closely related taxa to replace the extinct taxa. This is being done on several islands, with replacing closely related or ecologically functional [[giant tortoises]] to replace extinct giant tortoises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06305.x/abstract|title=Ecological history and latent conservation potential: large and giant tortoises as a model for taxon substitutions|first1=Dennis M.|last1=Hansen|first2=C.

At the [[Makauwahi Cave Reserve]] in [[Hawaii]], exotic tortoises are being used as a replacement for the extinct [[moa-nalo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cavereserve.org/|title=Makauwahi Cave Reserve|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a large flightless duck hunted to extinction by the first [[Polynesians]] to reach Hawaii.

'''Responsive neurostimulation device''' or '''RNS system''' is the first and only brain-responsive neurostimulation system designed to prevent epileptic seizures at their source. Similar to a pacemaker that monitors and responds to heart rhythms, the RNS System monitors and responds to brain activity. The RNS System is made by [http://www.neuropace.com NeuroPace, Inc].

The RNS neurostimulator is a small, implantable device connected to leads (tiny wires) that are placed in up to two seizure onset areas. The device continuously monitors brain activity, detects abnormal patterns, and in response delivers imperceptible electrical pulses to normalize the activity before an individual experiences seizures.

The RNS System was FDA approved in 2013 to treat adults with partial onset seizures that are not controlled by medications. The RNS System is currently available in most Level 4 Comprehensive Epilepsy Centers throughout the United States and is broadly covered by private and government insurance. As of March, 2017 over 1,000 patients have been implanted with the RNS System.

'''How the RNS System helps prevent seizures:'''

The RNS System continuously monitors brain activity at the seizure source. It works in the background, without the patient feeling anything.

The device is programmed by physicians to detect early, abnormal electrical patterns that can lead to seizures. These patterns are different for every individual, and the device can be personalized to recognize each brain's unique "fingerprint".

Within milliseconds of detecting abnormal brain activity, the RNS System sends tiny electrical pulses to disrupt the abnormal activity and normalize brainwaves. This real-time response is designed to prevent seizures from occurring.

The RNS System is the only treatment option that monitors and responds to brain activity directly at the seizure source. It delivers treatment when needed, on average less than 6 minutes of stimulation per day.

Once implanted, the RNS System is unnoticeable under and individual's hair, and device setting are personalized so that the stimulation is not felt.

A window to the brain: The RNS System is the only epilepsy therapy that also provides physicians clinically meaningful ongoing data about their patients’ seizure frequency and electrocorticographic activity. The patient uses a simple remote monitor at home to wirelessly collect and upload data from their neurostimulator. The data is made available to their doctor to review and analyze, so that they can improve patient care. The RNS System is surgically implanted in the skull by a trained neurosurgeon and typically involves an overnight stay in the hospital. The therapy is reversible; the procedure does not involve removing any brain tissue. For many medically refractory partial-onset epilepsy patients who are not candidates for epilepsy surgery, the RNS System provides a clinically proven therapy option to reduce seizure frequency and improve quality of life.

'''The RNS System Clinical Summary:'''

The RNS System was evaluated in a multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded clinical study—one of the largest and most rigorously conducted pivotal trials for any neuromodulation technology. The study included adults who have medically refractory, partial onset seizures with up to two localized seizure foci, and who had failed at least two medications. In total, 191 patients were randomized 1:1 to either treatment with the RNS System or sham stimulation. After the four month blinded period, stimulation was turned on for all patients. Treatment with the RNS System resulted in statistically significant seizure reductions compared to the sham group. By the end of the blinded period, patients in the Treatment group had a 41.5% reduction in disabling seizures compared to 9.4% in the Sham group (p=0.008). The safety profile of the RNS System compared favorably to deep brain stimulation as well as implantation of intracranial electrodes and epilepsy surgery (Morrell, 2011).

Patients treated with the RNS System experience substantial seizure reductions in the first year that continue to improve over time. At seven years, patients achieved a 72% median reduction in seizures (Bergey, 2015). Quality of life (QOL) and mood are often negatively affected by epilepsy, particularly in patients with poorly controlled seizures. Patients treated with the RNS System reported statistically significant improvements in mood and overall quality of life, including physical health, mental health, cognitive effects, and seizure worry (Meador, 2015).

Patients treated with the RNS System show no evidence of cognitive decline. In fact, they have demonstrated statistically significant
improvements in naming and verbal memory. This is meaningful because individuals with epilepsy are at risk for cognitive disability and
decline which has also been associated with other epilepsy treatments. For example, many antiepileptic drugs have adverse cognitive
effects, patients treated with deep brain stimulation have reported cognitive decline, and epilepsy surgery carries risks for decline in
cognitive areas specifically related to those regions of the brain that are resected (Loring, 2015).
Another notable feature of the RNS system is the subtle, virtually imperceptible, nature of the therapy. Device settings are personalized
so that patients do not feel or notice the stimulation. This is in contrast to other therapies, such as vagus nerve stimulation, which can
have chronic stimulation-related side effects such as voice alterations, coughing, throat discomfort, and shortness of breath.

==Early life==
Sam Farber was born on November 16, 1924, in [[New York City]], though he was raised in nearby [[Yonkers, New York]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; His father, Louis Farber, established Farber Brothers, which sold serving ware. His uncle, Simon Farber, founded [[Farberware]], which manufactures kitchen appliances and cookware.&lt;ref name=upi/&gt;

Farber served in [[North Africa]] and [[Turkey]] during [[World War II]] as a member of the [[Army Air Forces]].&lt;ref name=upi/&gt; He received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[economics]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1946.&lt;ref name=upi/&gt;

==Career==
===Copco===
In 1960, Farber founded Copco, which manufactured [[Vitreous enamel|enamel-coated]], [[cast iron]] [[cookware]].&lt;ref name=upi/&gt; He sold Copco in 1982, largely retiring from the industry at the time of the sale.&lt;ref name=upi/&gt;

===OXO===
Farber founded OXO as a result of improvements he made to an everyday [[vegetable peeler]].&lt;ref name=upi/&gt; While vacationing in a rented home in [[southern France]], his wife, Betsy Farber, who suffered from [[arthritis]], was trying to peel apples, which proved difficult using a peeler with a standard design.&lt;ref name=upi/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; The difficulties presented by available peelers (and their handles) sparked an idea for Sam. He and his son, John, soon hired Smart Design, an [[industrial design]] firm based in New York City,&lt;ref name=upi/&gt; with which they created a new product line of kitchen utensils fitted with soft plastic-coated black handles, which made them easier to hold and utilize than other utensils.&lt;ref name=upi/&gt;

Farber unveiled the new line at the Gourmet Products Show in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], in 1990.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Sam Farber named his company "OXO" for its "backward, upside-down and vertical graphic [[symmetry]]."&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Farber's OXO products were more expensive than competitors', but the line proved a hit with consumers, who were willing to pay more for the new, easier-to-use utensils.&lt;ref name=upi/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

The Farber family sold [[OXO (brand)|OXO]] to General Housewares Corporation in 1992. OXO is currently owned by Helen of Troy Limited, as of 2013.&lt;ref name=upi/&gt;

===Mario Batali products===
Sam and John Farber later created a line of products sold by chef [[Mario Batali]].&lt;ref name=upi/&gt;

===Boards===
An art collector, Farber served on the board of directors for the [[American Folk Art Museum]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=upi/&gt;

==Personal life==
He was a longtime resident of Manhattan but lived in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]], during his later years.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

==Death==
Sam Farber died in [[East Meadow, New York]] of complications from a fall on June 16, 2013, at the age of 88.&lt;ref name=upi/&gt; He was survived by his second wife, Betsey Wells Kriegsman, whom he married in 1985; his two sons from his first marriage, John Farber and Thomas Farber; two stepchildren, Mark Kriegsman and Sue Kriegsman; four granddaughters; and three step-granddaughters.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

[[File:Agent William's Car.jpg|thumb|right|220px|An FBI agent's bullet-riddled car after the [[1975 Pine Ridge shootout]].]]

A '''shootout''', also called a '''firefight''' or '''gunfight''', is a [[gun]] battle between armed groups. A shootout often, but not necessarily, pits [[law enforcement]] against [[criminal]] elements; it could also involve two groups outside of law enforcement, such as rival gangs. A shootout in a [[war]]-like context (i.e. regularly constituted [[armed forces]] or even [[guerrilla]] or [[insurgent]] forces) would usually be considered a '''[[battle]]''' (depending on size), rather than a ''shootout''. Shootouts are often portrayed in [[action film]]s and [[Western (genre)|Western films]].

==Famous shootouts in the United States and territories==

===The Greatest Shootout in the West===
On December 19, 1854, while trekking on a miner's trail along the North Fork of the [[American River]], Dr. Bolivar Sparks, James McDonald and [[Jonathan R. Davis|Captain Jonathan Davis]] were bushwhacked by an international band of bandits.  The bandits, who included a Frenchman, two Americans, two Englishmen, four Mexicans and four Australians, had recently robbed and killed four American miners on December 18, 1854, and six Chinese miners on December 17, 1854.  McDonald was killed instantly, and Dr. Sparks was fatally wounded, however Captain Davis, an Army veteran, pulled out both of his pistols and killed seven of the bandits in quick order. Out of bullets, Captain Davis, an expert fencer, pulled out his Bowie knife and killed four more of his attackers.  The surviving bandits fled for their lives. The shootout was witnessed by a group of miners, who buried the bodies of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Kulczyk, David. (2008). California Justice: Shootouts, Lynching and Assassinations in the Golden State.

'''Symphony No. 4''' in [[G major]] by [[Gustav Mahler]] was written in 1899 and 1900, though it incorporates a song originally written in 1892. The song, "Das himmlische Leben", presents a child's vision of Heaven. It is sung by a soprano in the work's fourth and final movement. Although typically described as being in the key of G major, the [[symphony]] employs a [[progressive tonality|progressive tonal scheme]] ('(b)/G—E').&lt;ref&gt;'Gustav Mahler' (Works), in ''New Grove'', Macmillan, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Mahler's first four symphonies are often referred to as the ''Wunderhorn'' symphonies because many of their themes originate in earlier songs by Mahler on texts from ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'' (''The Boy's Magic Horn''). The fourth symphony is built around a single song, "Das himmlische Leben" ("The Heavenly Life"). It is prefigured in various ways in the first three movements and sung in its entirety by a solo soprano in the fourth movement.

Mahler composed "Das himmlische Leben" as a freestanding piece in 1892. The title is Mahler's own: in the ''Wunderhorn'' collection the poem is called "Der Himmel hängt voll Geigen" (an idiomatic expression akin to "there's not a cloud in the sky"). Several years later Mahler considered using the song as the seventh and final movement of his [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 3]]. While motifs from "Das himmlische Leben" are found in the Symphony No. 3, Mahler eventually decided not to include it in that work and, instead, made the song the goal and source of his Symphony No. 4. This symphony thus presents a thematic fulfilment of the musical world of No. 3, which is part of the larger tetralogy of the first four symphonies, as Mahler described them to Natalie Bauer-Lechner. Early plans in which the Symphony was projected as a six-movement work included another ''Wunderhorn'' song, "Das irdische Leben" ("The Earthly Life") as a somber pendant to "Das himmlische Leben", offering a tableau of childhood starvation in juxtaposition to heavenly abundance, but Mahler later decided on a simpler structure for the score.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080611213449/http://www.andante.com/profiles/Mahler/symph4.cfm  Henry Louis de La Grange]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
A typical performance of the symphony lasts about an hour, making it one of Mahler's shorter symphonies. The performing forces are also small by Mahler's usual standard.

The movements of the symphony:
{{ordered list|list_style_type=upper-roman
|''Bedächtig, nicht eilen'' (Moderately, not rushed) – [[sonata form]]
|''In gemächlicher Bewegung, ohne Hast'' (Leisurely moving, without haste) – [[scherzo]] and trio
|''Ruhevoll, [[adagio (music)|poco adagio]]'' (Peacefully, somewhat slowly) – [[theme and variations]]
|''Sehr behaglich'' (Very comfortably) – [[strophic]]
}}
[[Concert flute|Flute]]s and [[sleigh bell]]s open the unusually{{clarify|date=September 2018}} restrained first movement (and used later with a melodic theme known commonly as the 'bell theme', which helps define sections throughout the movement) often described{{by whom|date=November 2015}} as possessing [[classical music era|classical]] poise. 
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt;  \relative c'' { \clef treble \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \key g \major \slashedGrace { g'8( } &lt;fis b,&gt;8-.)\p \slashedGrace { g( } &lt;fis b,&gt;-.) \slashedGrace { g( } &lt;fis b,&gt;-.) \slashedGrace { g( } &lt;fis b,&gt;-.) \slashedGrace { g( } &lt;fis b,&gt;-.) \slashedGrace { g( } &lt;fis b,&gt;-.) \slashedGrace { g( } &lt;fis b,&gt;-.) \slashedGrace { g( } &lt;fis b,&gt;-.) } &lt;/score&gt;
As would be expected for the first movement of a symphony, the first movement of Mahler's Symphony No. 4 is in [[sonata form]].

The primary theme:
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; \relative c'' { \clef treble \key g \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \partial 8*3 d8(\p\upbow^"grazioso"\&lt; e fis\!\glissando | g\pp b,16) r b4.(\downbow c32 b a b c8 d ) | dis4( e4.)\&lt; fis16\!-&gt;( e\&gt; d c b a)\! | g8.([ a16 b8. c16)] cis( d e d) \grace { c!8([ d] } c16-&gt; b c a) | g8-. } &lt;/score&gt;
The secondary theme:
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; \relative c' { \clef treble \key d \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \partial 8*1 a8\p(\downbow fis'4--) fis-- fis4.-- fis8( | g\&lt; fis g e)\!\glissando b'4(\&gt; a)\!\breathe } &lt;/score&gt;

The second movement is a [[scherzo]] that features a part for a solo [[violin]] whose strings are [[scordatura|tuned a whole tone higher]] than usual.
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; \relative c'' { \clef treble \time 3/8 \key c \minor \partial 16*3 b16\mf(\&lt; ees g\! | fis8.\p\&lt; d16 b\!\f f') | ees(\p f ees d c ees) | des( c des) f-. ees-. d-. | ees(\&gt;[ d c\!)] } &lt;/score&gt;
The violin depicts [[Death (personification)|Freund Hein]], (lit. "Friend Henry") a figure from medieval German art; Hain (or Hein) is a traditional German personification of death, invented by poet Matthias Claudius. Freund Hein is a skeleton who plays the fiddle and leads a [[Totentanz]] or "danse macabre". According to Mahler's widow, [[Alma Mahler|Alma]], Mahler took inspiration for this movement from an 1872 painting by the Swiss artist [[Arnold Bocklin]] entitled ''[[Self-Portrait with Death Playing the Fiddle|Self-Portrait with Death playing the Fiddle]]''. The scherzo represents his dance and the unusual tuning of the violin adds tension to its sound and contributes to the music's ghostly character.

The third movement is a solemn processional march cast as a set of [[variation form|variations]]. Mahler uses the theme and variation structure in a more unconventional way. This movement can be divided into five main sections: A1 – B1 – A2 – B2 – A3 – coda. The theme is presented in the first 16 bars of A1,
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; \relative c' { \clef treble \key g \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 b1\pp( | c) | d2..( e8) | e1 | fis2.( g4) | a2( fis4 g) | a( c b g) | fis( e d a8 b) | c1( | b2.) c8( d) | e2( d4 cis) | d2. e8( fis) | g2( fis4 e) | fis( e d2)\glissando | e4( d) c( b) | b2( a) } &lt;/score&gt;
but the true variations do not appear until section A3, although the theme is developed slightly within the preceding sections; sections A1, A2, B1 and B2 are in [[bar form]]. This movement remains mostly in G major, but does modulate to D minor, E minor and E major; the B2 section has a rather unstable tonality, being more chromatic and moving through many keys.

The fourth movement opens with a relaxed, bucolic scene in G major.
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; \relative c' { \clef treble \key g \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \partial 4*1 \times 2/3 { d8(\pp b' g } | d'2 \slashedGrace { e8 } d2-&gt; | \slashedGrace { e8 } d2-&gt; \slashedGrace { c8 } b8.-&gt;[ a16 g8.-&gt; a16] | d,2-&gt;) } &lt;/score&gt;
A child, voiced by a soprano, presents a sunny, naive vision of Heaven and describes the feast being prepared for all the saints.
:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; \relative c' { \clef treble \key g \major \autoBeamOff \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 r d8 d d4 b'8 g | d'8.[( e16 d8. e16] d8.[ e16 d8. e16] | \times 2/3 { d8[ c b]) } \times 2/3 { a[ b] g } d8.([ e16)] d8 } \addlyrics { Wir ge- nie- ßen die himm- li- schen Freu- den, } &lt;/score&gt;
The scene has its darker elements: the child makes it clear that the heavenly feast takes place at the expense of animals, including a sacrificed lamb. The child's narrative is punctuated by faster passages recapitulating the first movement. Unlike the final movement of traditional symphonies, the fourth movement of Mahler's No. 4 is essentially a song, containing verses, with interludes, a prelude and a postlude (a strophic structure). By the time the postlude is heard, there is a modulation to [[E major]] (the tonic major of the relative minor) and unusually stays in this key, ending the symphony away from the tonic of [[G major]]. Several ties to Symphony No. 3 can be heard in these passages as well.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for fairly small orchestra by Mahler's standards, consisting of the following:

;[[Woodwind instrument|Woodwinds]]
:4 [[western concert flute|flute]]s (3rd and 4th doubling [[piccolo]]s)
:3 [[oboe]]s (3rd doubling [[cor anglais]])
:3 B{{music|flat}}, A, C [[clarinet]]s (2nd doubling [[clarinet in E-flat|E{{music|flat}} clarinet]], 3rd doubling [[bass clarinet]])

;''Das himmlische Leben''
;(aus ''Des Knaben Wunderhorn'')

&lt;poem&gt;
Wir genießen die himmlischen Freuden,
D'rum tun wir das Irdische meiden.
Kein weltlich' Getümmel
Hört man nicht im Himmel!
Lebt alles in sanftester Ruh'.
Wir führen ein englisches Leben,
Sind dennoch ganz lustig daneben;
Wir tanzen und springen,
Wir hüpfen und singen,
Sankt Peter im Himmel sieht zu.

Johannes das Lämmlein auslasset,
Der Metzger Herodes d'rauf passet.
Wir führen ein geduldig's,
Unschuldig's, geduldig's,
Ein liebliches Lämmlein zu Tod.
Sankt Lucas den Ochsen tät schlachten
Ohn' einig's Bedenken und Achten.
Der Wein kost' kein Heller
Im himmlischen Keller;
Die Englein, die backen das Brot.

Gut' Kräuter von allerhand Arten,
Die wachsen im himmlischen Garten,
Gut' Spargel, Fisolen
Und was wir nur wollen.
Ganze Schüsseln voll sind uns bereit!
Gut' Äpfel, gut' Birn' und gut' Trauben;
Die Gärtner, die alles erlauben.
Willst Rehbock, willst Hasen,
Auf offener Straßen
Sie laufen herbei!
Sollt' ein Fasttag etwa kommen,
Alle Fische gleich mit Freuden angeschwommen!
Dort läuft schon Sankt Peter
Mit Netz und mit Köder
Zum himmlischen Weiher hinein.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Mahler here omitted the following four lines of the original poem: 
Willst Karpfen, willst Hecht, willst Forellen,
Gut Stockfisch und frische Sardellen?
Sanct Lorenz hat müssen
Sein Leben einbüßen&lt;/ref&gt;
Sankt Martha die Köchin muß sein.

Kein' Musik ist ja nicht auf Erden,
Die unsrer verglichen kann werden.
Elftausend Jungfrauen
Zu tanzen sich trauen.
Sankt Ursula selbst dazu lacht.
Kein' Musik ist ja nicht auf Erden,
Die unsrer verglichen kann werden.
Cäcilia mit ihren Verwandten
Sind treffliche Hofmusikanten!
Die englischen Stimmen
Ermuntern die Sinnen,
Daß alles für Freuden erwacht.

;''The Heavenly Life''
;(from ''[[Des Knaben Wunderhorn]]'')

&lt;poem&gt;
We enjoy heavenly pleasures
and therefore avoid the earthly stuff.
No worldly tumult
is to be heard in heaven.
All live in greatest peace.
We lead angelic lives,
yet have a merry time of it besides.
We dance and we spring,
We skip and we sing.
[[Saint Peter]] in heaven looks on.

[[John the Evangelist|John]] lets the lambkin out,
and [[Herod the Great|Herod]] the Butcher lies in wait for it.
We lead a patient,
an innocent, patient,
dear little lamb to its death.
[[Saint Luke]] slaughters the ox
without any thought or concern.
Wine doesn't cost a penny
in the heavenly cellars;
The angels bake the bread.

Good greens of every sort
grow in the heavenly vegetable patch,
good asparagus, string beans,
and whatever we want.
Whole dishfuls are set for us!
Good apples, good pears and good grapes,
and gardeners who allow everything!
If you want roebuck or hare,
on the public streets
they come running right up.
Should a fast day come along,
all the fishes at once come swimming with joy.
There goes Saint Peter running
with his net and his bait
to the heavenly pond.
Saint [[Martha of Bethany|Martha]] must be the cook.

There is just no music on earth
that can compare to ours.
Even the eleven thousand virgins
venture to dance,
and [[Saint Ursula]] herself has to laugh.
There is just no music on earth
that can compare to ours.
[[Saint Cecilia|Cecilia]] and all her relations
make excellent court musicians.
The angelic voices
gladden our senses,
so that all awaken for joy.
&lt;/poem&gt;

"'''The Galoshes of Fortune'''" ({{lang-da|Lykkens Kalosker}})&lt;ref&gt;Rossel, (2004), p.24&lt;/ref&gt; is a literary fairy tale by [[Hans Christian Andersen]] about a set of [[time travel|time-travelling]] boots, considered to be inspired by the folktale of the "[[seven-league boots]]" (''syvmilestøvler'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Brøndsted |first=Mogens |title=H. C. Andersen og avisen |publisher=Odense Universitetsforlag |year=1972 |page=57 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2NTkAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale was first published by C. A. Reitzel in [[Copenhagen, Denmark|Copenhagen]], Denmark on 19 May 1838 with ''[[The True Soldier]]'' (one-act verse play) and "[[That Was Done by the Zombie]]" (poem) in ''Three Poetical Works''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/liv/tidstavle/vis_e.html?aar=1838 |title=1838 |publisher=The Hans Christian Andersen Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reitzel paid Andersen 40 [[rixdollar]]s for the story. In the tale, Andersen continues to perfect his colloquial style.&lt;ref&gt;Wullschlager 184&lt;/ref&gt; Andersen read the tale aloud in the late 1830s with his novel ''[[Only a Fiddler]]''.&lt;ref name="Andersen 68, 251"&gt;Andersen 68,251&lt;/ref&gt; The tale irritated the young Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]]&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, (1990) pp.59-60&lt;/ref&gt; with its satirical portrait of a bird that babbles on endlessly in a philosophical vein.&lt;ref name="Andersen 68, 251" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, (2009), p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story is set in [[Copenhagen]]. A group of guests are holding a large party. During the festivity Counciler of Justice Knap argues that the [[Middle Ages]] were a time better than their own, more specifically the time of [[John, King of Denmark|King Hans]]. Suddenly two fairies arrive, dressed up as house maids. One is old, Dame Care, the other is a minion of [[Fortuna|Dame Fortune]]. The dame has brought a pair of [[galoshes]] along that can transport whoever wears them to whatever time, place or condition in life that he desires. And his every wish in regard to time and place will be instantly granted. Dame Care predicts that it will nevertheless make the person unhappy, wishing he was back in the present.

As the party concludes Councilor Knap decides to go home. He finds the galoshes, puts them on and is sent back to the reign of King Hans. He is not immediately aware of what happened, but does notice that the unpaved streets are full with filth and mud. He notices a procession for the Bishop of [[Seeland, Germany|Seeland]] and assumes it's for the bishop from his time period. As he wants to cross the bridge to Palace Square he notices it's gone and ask two men in a boat where the bridge is and that he wants to go to Christian's Harbour on Little Market Street. The men have no idea what he is talking about and Knap has trouble understanding their speech, which he assumes is an accent that belongs to people of [[Bornholm]]. As a result, he continues his walk, frustrated that not only the bridge is gone and all the lights are out, but that there are also no cabs to take. He decides to walk back to the East Street, but to his amazement the East Gate is now a [[meadow]]. Knap assumes he must be ill and desperately wants to go home, but he can't recognize any of the buildings. As he enters a tavern he tries to find his local paper, but they don't have it. When he notices a woodcut of a [[meteor]] over [[Cologne]] he wonders where the owners "got this rare old print?". As he discusses the content he gets into a conversation in [[Latin]] with a man who holds a bachelor in [[theology]]. They discuss many topics and Knap keeps misinterpreting these medieval topics for events that happened in his own lifetime. For instance, he confuses a remark about the [[Black Plague]] with a reference to a [[cholera]] epidemic in the 19th century. As the evening continues they all begin to drink more and Knap is repulsed by the vulgar behaviour of the people. He decides to sneak out, but the others pull him back from under the table by his feet, thereby pulling off the galoshes and breaking the spell. Waking up in his own age Knapp assumes it was all a dream and now fancies his own time period as the best.

Next, a [[Security guard|watchman]] tries the galoshes on. He wishes to be the lieutenant, because he assumes his life is much better than his. The galoshes do their work and suddenly the watchmen becomes the lieutenant, sitting at his desk. He notices the lieutenant had written a poem called, "If Only I Were Rich", which confesses that the lieutenant actually feels he is short on money and is lonely as a result. Then he realizes he would rather be a watchman, because he at least has a wife and children who share his joy and sorrows. The galoshes then transform him back into himself. The watchman, still unaware what has happened, watches a [[Meteoroid|falling star]]. He wishes he could travel to the [[moon]] and suddenly the galoshes send him there at the [[speed of light]]. There he meets several moon men who all wonder whether [[Earth]] is inhabited and decide this must be impossible. Back on Earth the lifeless body of the watchman is found and he is brought to a hospital, where they take his shoes off, breaking the spell again. He awakens and declares it to have been the most terrible night he had ever experienced.

As the galoshes remain in the hospital one of the young night internes tries them on. His task is to guard the hospital fence, but he wishes to get out for a while, wondering whether he "could get his head through the fence and escape." As soon as he thinks this his head is stuck and he's unable to pull it back. He struggles for a while, until he wishes he was free again, which is granted by the galoshes. The next day the intern attends a [[theatrical play]] called "My Grandmother's Spectacles" in Kannike Street. The spectacles in the play are able to let anyone who wears them read the future from people's faces. The internee wishes he had such a pair of glasses and soon enough he has them. As he witnesses into the spectators' on the front row's hearts he notices all kinds of bizarre views. He concludes he must have had too much blood rushing to his head and wishes he could take a Russian [[steam bath]]. Suddenly he is indeed there, but fully clothed and scaring off the other people in the room. He has enough sense to pull himself together and tell everybody it's part of a bet. He then returns home and the next day he has a blistered back.

Meanwhile, the watchman picks up the galoshes at the hospital and turns them in at the police station where they are accidentally given to a [[clerk]] whose galoshes happened to have been lost too. During a walk the clerk meets a friend who is a poet and desires to live his life, for it seems to be much more enjoyable than his. At first the clerk enjoys being a poet full of inspiration. Then he wishes he was a [[lark]], but is caught by a little boy and sold off to a family, where he is put inside a cage. He talks with a [[Domestic canary|canary]] and [[parrot]], who both lament the days when they were still free. As it so happens the cage door is open and the clerk tries to fly away, but is attacked by a cat. He manages to fly back to his own home, where the spell is broken again.

Then the fairy tale concludes with the clerk's neighbour, a theological student, asking for the galoshes. The clerk gives them to him. As the student walks away he wishes he could travel to Switzerland and Italy, whereupon he is on top of the [[Mont Blanc]]. In the freezing weather he wishes he was on the other side of the Alps, where he ends up in Italy, near Lake Thrasymene. There he enjoys the beautiful landscapes, but he is confronted with the local people's hunger and poverty. He concludes that it would be better off if his body could rest, while the spirit flies on without it. The galoshes grant his wish and he is now peacefully dead. Andersen concludes with a quote by [[Solon]]: "Call no man happy until he rests in his grave." Dame Care then tells the other fairy that her predictions have indeed all came true. Though she does grant the student a favor. She takes off his galoshes and takes them back with her, causing him to be brought back to life.

'''Vincenzo Monaco''' (20 July 1911 Rome – 3 March 1969, [[Rome]]) was an Italian [[architect]] who collaborated with [http://www.nandoandelsaperettifoundation.org/en/page.php?project=367 Amedeo Luccichenti] from 1933 to 1963. During this period, Monaco designed more than 450 projects, of which approximately 100 were built. His work can be seen in buildings in Rome, [[Pisa]], [[Naples]], and [[Taranto]], as well as in [[Dalmatia]], [[Iran]], [[France]], and [[Tunisia]].

== Career ==
Even before receiving a degree in architecture from [[Sapienza University of Rome]] in 1934, Monaco collaborated with F. Petrucci and C. Longo in national competitions; one in 1933 to design four new postal buildings in Rome, and one in 1934 to design the Clinical Hospital of [[Modena]]. In 1936, he worked with G. Calza Bini, S. Muratori, F. Petrucci, Ludovico Quaroni, and E. Tedeschi on the sixth [[Triennale|Triennale di Milano]].

In 1937, Monaco began working with Luccichenti, a partnership that would last until 1963. Together, they worked on the Augustine Exhibition of the Roman Empire ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Mostra Augustea della Romanità'') and the [[Palazzo dei Congressi]] in [[EUR, Rome]], in 1938; buildings at the [[Circus Maximus]] in 1953; the [[Olympic Village]] for the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in Rome from 1958–60; [[Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport]] from 1957–60; the SIAE building in EUR from 1963–65, the Roccaraso Church in 1966; and the Jolly Hotel in Rome in 1968.

The collaboration between Monaco and Luccichenti influenced the design of a number of apartment buildings, villas, and Roman houses from 1945 to 1955. They were noted for their experimental and rational style, which can be seen in several buildings in Rome, including the office of the Shipping Company of Italy, [[KLM]]'s air travel agency on Via Barberini, a [[Lancia]] dealership, and the SIAE building on Via Emanuele Gianturco; the restructurations of Caffè Rosati in via Veneto at the 1946 and the night club Le Pleiadi in via Sistina, 1947, both places of worship of '''Dolce Vita'''.

At the end of the 1950s, the Monaco-Luccichenti Studio&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artribune.com/tag/studio-monaco-e-luccichenti/&lt;/ref&gt; was chosen by the Ministry of Public Works to manage the international engineering and architectural work for the 1960 Summer Olympics, including the Olympic Village, in collaboration with [[Adalberto Libera]], [[Luigi Moretti]], Vittorio Cafiero, and [[Pier Luigi Nervi]].

In 1955, during the presidency of [[Giovanni Gronchi]], Monaco realized the restructuring of the Lupa Hall at Palazzo Montecitorio. Other works include the enlargement of Castelporziano, the official palace in San Rossore, the Villa Maria Pia in the estate of the president, Villa Rosebery in Naples.

Other works to remember are: In Rome in 1948, Palazzina Street S. Valentino, 3; buildings between S.Crescenziano street and Via Salaria (Villa Ada Park); 1949 Building in Viale Parioli, 92-96; Buildings in via Circo Massimo 1-9; Villas in Fregene and Santa Marinella; 1951 Offices Building in Via Po; 1957 apartments building in Via Archimede 156; Building in Via Stoppani, 10; 1953 Building in Avenue Villa Grazioli, 26; Building in via Ximenes, 3; 1962 Buildings intensive
in Via Prenestina, 4; 1964 Office building SIAE, viale dell'Arte at EUR; 1965, Palace at viale della Tecnica; 1968–69, Office building, in via Silvio d'Amico, (with his brother Ing. Pietro Monaco 1910-1997) the roof is designed by G. Capogrossi; Palace of Confindustria, in viale dell'Astronomia n.30, [[EUR, Rome|EUR]] district, realized with his son architect Edoardo Monaco, and the parking was designed by the artist [[Giuseppe Capogrossi]]; 1969–71, The Jolly Hotel building in Corso d'Italia beside Villa Borghese Park. Offices SLE-ICOR Rome-Eur. In Tunis, he realizes the Complex for Congresses and banquets "La Salle des Fêtes". In the 1960, the construction of furniture of the class of Ships [[SS Leonardo da Vinci (1960)]] and [[SS Michelangelo]] with preparation and supervision with Nino Zoncada and [[Giulio Carlo Argan]], the works of many contemporary artists: [[Giuseppe Capogrossi]], Cagli, Antonio Corpora [[Giulio Turcato]], Giuseppe Santomaso, Roberto Aloi, Tranquillo Marangoni, [[Salvatore Fiume]], [[Gino Severini]], [[Emanuele Luzzati]], Lojze Spacal.

Many of Monaco's works resulted from contests held during the Fascist age. Examples include the Politic-touristic-custom buildings (1937), Office of the Fascist Confederation of traders (1939), and the moving Bridge at Magliana (1940). He joined the competition [[EUR, Rome|E42 (EUR, Rome)]] for the [[Palazzo dei Congressi]] (1937–38) and other projects including the preparation for the "Mostra Augustea della Romanità" (1937.)

== Awards and honors ==
For his contributions to the modern architectural movement in Italy, particularly during the years of reconstruction after World War II, he was awarded the honor of Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic on 25 November 1968.

In 2015, he was honored with the painter [[Giuseppe Capogrossi]] as "Studio Monaco Luccichenti" at the [[MAXXI]] National Museum of XXI Century Arts in Rome, in the free permanent exhibition.

==Biography==
Born in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]], William Brenton Hall was the eldest son of Brenton Hall, a prosperous farmer, and Lament Collins, daughter of Captain Jonathan and Agnes (Linn) Collins of Wallingford. Brenton Hall was son of Rev. Samuel Hall of [[Cheshire, Connecticut|Cheshire]] (Yale, 1716). Described by [[Ezra Stiles]] as the wealthiest minister in Connecticut, the Rev. Hall owned extensive properties in central Connecticut, as well as land inherited from his mother's prominent [[Rhode Island]] family, the Brentons.

Hall was extraordinarily well-connected. His uncle, [[Jonathan Law]] (Harvard 1695), served as Governor (1741–1750) and Chief Justice of Connecticut (1724–1741). His great-grandfather, served on the Governor's Council. His cousin, [[Lyman Hall]], would serve as Governor of Georgia and would be signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. His uncle Elihu Hall (Yale 1731) was King's Attorney for the Colony. The land-rich Halls and their kin were pillars of the Old Light faction of [[Congregationalists]] that opposed the [[Great Awakening]] and the ascendant commercial interests associated with it.

William Brenton Hall attended local schools and was prepared for [[Yale]] by the Rev. Enoch Huntington of [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]]. He entered the college in 1782. On graduating in 1786, he went to [[Philadelphia]] to attend medical lectures at [[Pennsylvania Hospital]], then completed his training with Dr. Jared Potter of Wallingford (Yale 1760). He set up practice in Middletown, then the largest city in the state and one of its most prosperous seaports.

In 1796, Dr. Hall married Mehetable Parsons, daughter of Revolutionary hero, Major General [[Samuel Holden Parsons]] (Harvard 1756), who had died while serving as Chief Justice of the [[Northwest Territory]]. The marriage brought him substantial land holdings in [[Ohio]], as well as a host of distinguished relatives, including brothers-in-law, Stephen Titus Hosmer, who would become Chief Justice of the State of Connecticut, Enoch Parsons, who would head the Middletown branch of the Bank of the United States, and Samuel Holden Parsons, who would long serve as High Sheriff of [[Middlesex County, Connecticut|Middlesex County]].

Better prepared than most of his apprenticeship-trained contemporaries, Hall quickly became one of the leading physicians in the state. He pioneered obstetrics, guided by the detailed illustrated manuals, published in [[Edinburgh]], that he brought back from his studies in Philadelphia. He was particularly concerned with epidemic disease, repeatedly petitioning town authorities in Wallingford and Middletown for permission to establish a "pock house" for inoculating against small pox.

Hall's anti-federalist political inclinations may have helped him to develop a relationship with Boston physician [[Benjamin Waterhouse]], a correspondent of British physician [[Edward Jenner]], discoverer of [[vaccination]]. Jenner sent samples of [[cowpox]] matter to Waterhouse, some of which may have been passed on to Hall, who appears to have been the first physician in Connecticut to practice vaccination.

In 1796, Hall played a heroic role during a [[yellow fever]] epidemic at Knowles Landing, south of Middletown on the [[Connecticut River]]. When all the village's established physicians had fled, Hall stayed on to care for the sick and bury the dead. His exploits were reported in Miner &amp; Tully's ''Essays on Fevers'' (1823), a pioneering study of epidemic disease.

Hall played a leading role in organizing the Connecticut Medical Society and served as its treasurer from 1799 until his death a decade later. He was noted as an educator of physicians and often had as many as six apprentices residing with him in his spacious house on Middletown's Main Street (William Brenton Hall Account Book, 1807–1809).

As [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] struggled to take control of the Medical Society in 1807, Hall and his [[Democratic-Republican Party|Jeffersonian]] friends, who were officers of the society, became the object of a vicious satirical poem by physician and wit, [[Mason Fitch Cogswell]]:

    Next see arise and puff across the stage,
    The learned puppet of this learned age.
    This pious child in Middletown appears,
    With tongue much more supplied, than brains, or ears. . . .
    With him, to make young Doctors rules are vain,
    "Blair's Lectures" only, make the business plain,
    With these in hand, he turns them out as fast
    As tramping tinkers pewter buttons cast.
    Strange, very strange, that in one soul we find
    Such great and numerous offices combined;
    Surgeon, Demagogue, Preceptor, Preacher,
    Dentist, Physician, Midwife, Rhetoric-teacher,
    Moral Philosopher, Schoolmaster, all
    Unite &amp; harmonize in Doctor Hall.

==Death==
According to his contemporaries, [[alcoholism]] was an occupational disease for physicians in this era. Hall, known to be a heavy drinker, began to fail in the spring of 1809. Attempting to visit a patient in June 1809, he fell from his horse and died of his injuries on June 29, aged 45. He was buried in the Liberty Street Cemetery in Middletown. He left a widow and two young sons, William Brenton Hall Jr. and State Senator [[Samuel H. P. Hall]] (1804–1877).

==Posthumous==
Despite the advantages of pedigree and education, Hall was handicapped by the time and place in which he lived. The extensive kinship network of which he was a part would have served him well had the Old Lights been able to maintain their political dominance. Defeats at the polls and in ecclesiastical tribunals pushed them to the margins. Many, like Hall and his father Brenton (who represented Meriden in the legislature for many terms), became anti-federalists and ardent Jeffersonians. Others, like Hall's siblings, abandoned the established Congregational church for dissenting sects. This constituted a major obstacle to success in a state dominated by an oppressive Federalist-Congregationalist political machine.

Had Hall followed his Yale classmate, fellow physician [[Elihu Hubbard Smith]], to [[New York City]]—where political and religious heterodoxy was tolerated --, he might have had a more distinguished career. Smith, who also studied medicine at Pennsylvania Hospital, established himself in New York, where he founded America's first medical journal, the ''[[Medical Repository]]''.
