'''Basil A. Rebera''' is an Old Testament Scholar and a [[Translation]] Consultant&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; with the [[United Bible Societies]] focusing on translations of the [[Bible]] the world over.  As a contributor to scholarly research, Rebera's writings have been reviewed in [[Journal of Biblical Literature]]&lt;ref&gt;''Collected Essays'', 1988. [[Journal of Biblical Literature]] 107 (3). The Society of Biblical Literature: 573–77. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3267619]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Bible Translator]].

In 1975, Rebera took part in the second All-India Biblical Meeting&lt;ref name="Amalorpavadass"/&gt; held under the aegis of the National Biblical, Catechetical and Liturgical Centre in [[Bangalore]] led by [[The Reverend|Rev]]. [[Father (title)|Fr]] [[D. S. Amalorpavadass]] where Rebera presented a report on the Inter-Confessional translations of the [[Bible Society of India]].

==Contribution==
Rebera is an authority on [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] and his linguistic analysis has caught the attention of many [[Translation scholar]]s.  Kristin Moen Saxegaard in ''Character Complexity in the Book of Ruth''&lt;ref&gt;Kristin Moen Saxegaard in ''Character Complexity in the Book of Ruth'', Mohr Siebeck, Tubingen, 2010,  p.168.[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=wvU1XOnKjnkC&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;ots=5sQOFLiR1y&amp;dq=basil%20a.%20rebera&amp;pg=PA168#v=onepage&amp;q=basil%20a.%20rebera&amp;f=false ]&lt;/ref&gt; writes that {{quote|Basil A. Rebera raises another theological question in his arguments.  Normally in Ruth (Ruth 1:8; 2:12, 19; 3:10; 4:11), it is the "beneficiary that merits the invocation" which is the focus, not the benefactor.  When Ruth tells Naomi that it was at Boaz' field, Naomi "immediately invokes a second blessing in Ruth 2:20.".  I find Rebera's arguments convincing.}}

Further, Robert B. Chisholm of the [[Dallas Theological Seminary]] in ''Interpreting the Historical Books: An Exegetical Handbook&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Chisholm in ''Interpreting the Historical Books: An Exegetical Handbook'', Kregel, Grand Rapids, 2006, p.154. [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=dTRMDsrIzycC&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;ots=iPS2Dznjoi&amp;dq=basil%20a.%20rebera&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=basil%20a.%20rebera&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;'' writes that {{quote|Collation analysis can be the key to correct interpretation.  A fine example of this is Basil Rebera's study of Naomi's blessing in Ruth 2:20.}}

Joy Sisley of the [[Staffordshire University]] in her work, ''Power and Interpretive Authority in Multimedia Translation&lt;ref&gt;Joy Sisley, ''Power and Interpretive Authority in Multimedia Translation'' in Paul A. Soukup, Robert Hodgson (Edited), ''Fidelity and Translation: Communicating the Bible in New Media'', Sheed and Ward/ABS, Wisconsin/New York, 1999, p.206.  [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=lVprPJCewxgC&amp;pg=PA286&amp;dq=australian+national+university+basil+a.+rebera&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAGoVChMI7evToanyyAIVZ12mCh2dpg3C#v=onepage&amp;q=rebera&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;'' writes, {{quote|Basil Rebera argues that any discussion of faithfulness should recognize that "Christians and people of other faiths alike recognize only a written text as the Christian Scriptural source of revelation and authority".  Rebera links the issue of faithfulness to the original Word with a problem of authenticity.  He discusses the problem of fidelity in fairly narrow terms by pointing to a distinction between the specific nature of images and the generic nature of language.  He applies the same criteria of [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalence]] as the linguistic model by assuming that the meaning of the image is intentional in that it stands for the object it represents in a one-to-one relationship.}}

==Studies==

===Graduate===
Rebera pursued graduate studies in theology from 1967-1971&lt;ref name="Hiwale"/&gt; at the [[United Theological College, Bangalore]], the only autonomous College under the nation's first University,&lt;ref&gt;[[Murli Manohar Joshi]], ''Higher Education in India Vision and Action, A paper presented at the UNESCO World Conference on Higher Education in the Twenty First Century, Paris, 5–9 October 1998. Internet, accessed 22 August 2008.  [http://education.nic.in/unhighedu.asp]''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Senate of Serampore College (University)]]&lt;ref name="Hiwale"&gt;K. M. Hiwale (Compiled), ''Directory of the United Theological College 1910-1997'', Bangalore, 1997. Past students of the college diploma course, p.40; Postgraduate course, p.108.&lt;/ref&gt; where he obtained a [[Bachelor of Divinity]] ''([[B. D.]])'' during the Principalship of [[Joshua Russell Chandran]].  Incidentally, when the Old Testament Scholar and an [[alma mater]] of the College, [[Victor Premasagar]] happened to proceed to [[St. Andrew's University]] for research studies, he happened to stop over at the College and taught introductory [[Biblical Hebrew]] to the graduate students.  As a student of Victor Premasagar, Rebera took interest in learning the ancient Biblical languages and went on to enroll for postgraduate studies in [[Biblical Studies]] specializing in [[Old Testament]].

During his collegiate studies, Rebera took an active part in literary pursuits and was made Assistant Editor of the ''UTC College Magazine'' during 1969-1970.&lt;ref&gt;''United Theological College Magazine'', Volume XXXVI, 1969-1970 available at the Archives in the library of [[Karnataka Theological College]], [[Mangalore]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-graduate===
Soon after Rebera completed his graduate studies, the [[Bible Society of India]] led by the [[clergy]] consisting of [[A. E. Inbanathan]] and [[Chrysostom Arangaden|C. Arangaden]], then General Secretary&lt;ref name="Amalorpavadass"/&gt; and Associate General Secretary (Translations)&lt;ref name="Amalorpavadass"/&gt; respectively, chose Rebera to pursue post-graduate studies in Biblical Studies so that he would be an asset to the Bible Society of India.  Rebera then continued his studies at the Seminary by enrolling into [[Master of Theology]], specializing in Old Testament under [[E. C. John]] from 1971-1973 working out a dissertation entitled ''The meaning of mispat and sedeq/sedaqah in the [[pre-exilic]] prophetic literature and their translation in the [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] Bible''.&lt;ref name="Basil A. Rebera 1991"&gt;Basil A. Rebera, ''The meaning of mispat and sedeq/sedaqah in the pre-exilic prophetic literature and their translation in the Sinhalese Bible'' in ''Thesis Titles'', [[Board of Theological Education of the Senate of Serampore College]], Bangalore, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rebera was part the pioneer group of postgraduate students who specialised in Old Testament comprising A. P. Chacko, G. Babu Rao, [[N. K. Achumi]], [[S. J. Theodore]] and [[Timotheas Hembrom]].  The University awarded graduate and postgraduate degrees in the ensuing convocations during the Registrarship of [[C. Devasahayam]].

====Study Companions====
Rebera and his erstwhile companions at the United Theological College, Bangalore comprising G. Babu Rao, [[S. J. Theodore]], [[N. K. Achumi]], A. P. Chacko, and [[Timotheas Hembrom]] were notable for their contribution to the [[Bible Society]] in translation and revision of the scriptures into other languages.  While [[Timotheas Hembrom]] was involved in [[Santali language]] translation, [[N. K. Achumi]]&lt;ref&gt;[[N. K. Achumi]], ''Translation of 'God' and 'Lord' in Some Naga Bibles.'', ''[[The Bible Translator]]'', 43/4 (1992):439-443.  [http://www.ubs-translations.org/tbt/1992/04/TBT199204.html?num=439]&lt;/ref&gt; was involved in translation/revision of the Bible in [[Naga language]].  Similarly, G. Babu Rao joined the [[Bible Society of India]] in 1973 as Translator&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;[[H. S. Wilson]] (Edited), The Church on the Move, Essays in honour of [[Victor Premasagar]], Christian Literature Society, Madras, 1988, p.vi. [https://books.google.co.in/books?ei=iR-HVZnHN43GuAT82IDwBQ&amp;id=S-wrAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=victor+premasagar+g.babu+rao&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=babu+rao]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] Old Testament and a decade later, in 1984, became Coordinator of the Telugu Old Testament Common Language Translation (Telugu OT-CL) Project of the [[Bible Society of India]] which also took along [[S. J. Theodore]] on the panel of the Telugu OT-CL Project Team.

[[E. C. John]], the Professor of Rebera and his study companions was instrumental in infusing scholarly enthusiasm among his students.  Known for his scholarship&lt;ref&gt;[[E. C. John]], ''Divine Manifestations'', Bangalore Theological Forum, III/2, Bengaluru, July 1971.  p.19.  Cited by G. Babu Rao in ''Wisdom Tradition and the Indian Parallels with special reference to Telugu literature'', [[Andhra Christian Theological College]], Hyderabad, 1990.

John]] was also involved in [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]]&lt;ref&gt;''The National Christian Council Review'', Volume 84, Wesley Press and Publishing House, 1964, p.135.&lt;/ref&gt; translation of the [[Bible]].

===Research===
For research studies, Rebera studied at the [[Macquarie University]] and at the [[Australian National University]] and was awarded a doctorate by the Macquarie University in 1981 in Biblical Studies&lt;ref name="Fidelity"&gt;Paul A. Soukup, Robert Hodgson (Edited), ''Fidelity and Translation: Communicating the Bible in New Media'', Sheed and Ward/ABS, Wisconsin/New York, 1999, p.286.

==Translation career==
The confidence reposed in Rebera by the clergy consisting of the rural Pastor, A. E. Inbanathan and C. Arangaden remained for posterity as Rebera metamorphosed himself into a [[Translation scholar]].

===Bible Society of India===
Rebera began his career as a Translator with the Bible Society of India&lt;ref name="Amalorpavadass"/&gt; right from 1973 onwards.

===United Bible Societies===
In 1974, Rebera was appointed [[Translation]]&lt;ref name="Fidelity"/&gt; Consultant by the [[United Bible Societies]] for the [[Asia-Pacific|Asia-Pacific Region]] Region and was based in [[India]],&lt;ref name="Fidelity"/&gt; [[Thailand]]&lt;ref name="Fidelity"/&gt; and [[Singapore]],&lt;ref name="Fidelity"/&gt; a position which he held until 1988 till he moved to the [[Bible Society Australia]].

In his second stint starting in 1993 at the United Bible Societies, Rebera became Coordinator &lt;ref name="Fidelity"/&gt; for the Global Translation Services at the United Bible Societies and was based&lt;ref name="Fidelity"/&gt; in [[New York (City)|New York]] at the [[American Bible Society]].  Rebera was appointed in 1993-1994&lt;ref name="History"&gt;Philip A. Noss, ''A History of Bible Translation'', Amer Bible Society, 2007, p.242. [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=GqTYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=basil+rebera+bible&amp;dq=basil+rebera+bible&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBmoVChMI3uCW6q_yyAIVAyamCh1kkg0Z]&lt;/ref&gt; and oversaw translations of the Bible into many languages and also the revision of the existing versions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://canberraregion.unitingchurch.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Perspective-web.pdf ''Perspective'', Volume 21, Issue 97, Winter 2015, p.5]&lt;/ref&gt;  Rebera worked closely with the Asia-Pacific Regional Translations Coordinator, [[Graham S. Ogden]].&lt;ref name="Fry"/&gt;

===Bible Society Australia===
In 1988, Rebera took up the position of [[Director (business)|Director]],&lt;ref name="Fidelity"/&gt; Translation and Text Division of the Bible Society Australia.  After a 6-year stint with the Bible Society Australia, Rebera again moved to the United Bible Societies in 1993.

'''Becan''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: '''Becán''') is an [[archaeological site]] of the [[Maya civilization]] in [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]. Becan is located near the center of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], in the present-day [[Mexican state]] of [[Campeche]], about 150&amp;nbsp;km (93.2&amp;nbsp;mi) north of [[Tikal]]. The Maya sites of [[Balamku]], [[Calakmul]], [[Chicanna]] and [[Xpuhil]] are nearby. The name ''Becan'' was bestowed on the site by archaeologists who rediscovered the site, meaning "ravine or canyon formed by water" in [[Yukatek Maya]], after the site's most prominent and unusual feature, its surrounding ditch.

Archaeological evidence shows that Becan was occupied in the middle [[Preclassic Maya]] period, about 550 BCE, and grew to a major population and ceremonial center a few hundred years later in the late Preclassic. The population and scale of construction declined in the early classic (c 250 [[Common Era|CE]]), although it was still a significant site, and trade goods from [[Teotihuacan]] have been found. A ditch and ramparts were constructed around the site at this time. There is a ditch that runs the circumference of the city which covers approximately 25 [[hectare]]s (61.7 [[acre]]s). Around 500 the population again increased dramatically and many large new buildings were constructed, mostly in the ''[[Rio Bec]]'' style of Maya architecture. Construction of major buildings and elite monuments stopped about 830, although ceramic evidence show that the site continued to be occupied for some time thereafter, although the population went into decline and Becan was probably abandoned by about 1200. 

The site was first documented in the archaeological literature in 1934 by archaeologists Karl Ruppert and John Denison on an expedition to the region sponsored by the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]], who named it "Becan" after the conspicuous ditch surrounding the center of the city; the ancient name of the site is not known. From 1969 to 1971 archaeological excavations were made at Becan sponsored by [[Tulane University]] and the [[National Geographic Society]].

In 1984, while conducting research at the site, one of Mexico's "most important archeologists", [[Román Piña Chán]], fell from the pyramid at Becán, becoming paralyzed. On 13 July 2001, at a homage paid to Piña by the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico)|National Museum of Anthropology]], it was announced that Lucía Campaña, had discovered a pre-Hispanic tomb in the ninth building at the site, the previous day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jimenez|first1=Arturo|title=Homenaje póstumo al arqueólogo en el Museo Nacional de Antropología|url=http://www.jornada.com.mx/2001/07/13/06an1cul.html|accessdate=1 April 2018|publisher=''[[La Jornada]]''|date=13 July 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180401190720/http://www.jornada.com.mx/2001/07/13/06an1cul.html|archivedate=1 April 2018|location=Mexico City, Mexico|language=Spanish|trans-title=Posthumous tribute to the archaeologist at the National Museum of Anthropology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Polygraphiae.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Johannes Trithemius]]' ''Polygraphiae (1518)'' is the first printed book on [[cryptology]].]]

'''Books on [[cryptography]]''' have been published sporadically and with highly variable quality for a long time. This is despite the tempting, though superficial, [[paradox]] that secrecy is of the essence in sending confidential messages — see [[Kerckhoffs' principle]].

In contrast, the revolutions in [[cryptography]] and secure [[information transfer|communications]] since the 1970s are well covered in the available literature.

==Early history==
An early example of a book about cryptography was a Roman work,{{Which|date=October 2012}} now lost and known only by references. Many early cryptographic works were esoteric, mystical, and/or reputation-promoting; cryptography being mysterious, there was much opportunity for such things. At least one work by [[Trithemius]] was banned by the Catholic Church and put on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] as being about black magic or witchcraft. Many writers claimed to have invented unbreakable [[cipher]]s. None were, though it sometimes took a long while to establish this.

In the 19th century, the general standard improved somewhat (e.g., works by [[Auguste Kerckhoffs]], [[Friedrich Kasiski]], and [[Étienne Bazeries]]). Colonel [[Parker Hitt]] and [[William F. Friedman|William Friedman]] in the early 20th century also wrote books on cryptography. These authors, and others, mostly abandoned any mystical or magical tone.

==Open literature versus classified literature==
With the invention of radio, much of military communications went wireless, allowing the possibility of enemy interception much more readily than tapping into a landline.  This increased the need to protect communications. By the end of [[World War I]], cryptography and its literature began to be officially limited. One exception was [[The American Black Chamber]] by [[Herbert Yardley]], which gave some insight into American cryptologic success stories, including the [[Zimmermann telegram]] and the breaking of Japanese codes during the [[Washington Naval Conference]].

==''The Codebreakers''==
From the end of World War II until the early 1980s most aspects of modern cryptography were regarded as the special concern of governments and the military, and were protected by custom and, in some cases, by statute. The most significant work to be published on cryptography in this period is undoubtedly [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]]'s ''[[The Codebreakers]]'', which was published at a time (mid-1960s) when virtually no information on the modern practice of cryptography was available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol12i3/html/v12i3a09p_0001.htm The Codebreakers: The Story of Secret Writing by David Kahn, internal CIA  book review by Roger Pineau], ca.1967, released to public 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Kahn has said that over ninety percent of its content was previously unpublished.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} 

The book caused serious concern at the [[NSA]] despite its lack of coverage of specific modern cryptographic practice, so much so that after failing to prevent the book being published, NSA staff were informed to not even acknowledge the existence of the book if asked. In the US military, mere possession of a copy by cryptographic personnel was grounds for some considerable suspicion. Perhaps the single greatest importance of the book was the impact it had on the next generation of cryptographers. [[Whitfield Diffie]] has made comments in interviews about the effect it had on him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://simonsingh.net/books/recommended-books/great-cryptography-books/the-codebreakers/ Review by Simon Singh]&lt;/ref&gt;

==List==
Significant books on cryptography include:

* [[Rosario Candela|Candela, Rosario]] (1938). ''The Military Cipher of [[Étienne Bazeries|Commandant Bazeries]]''. New York: Cardanus Press, This book detailed cracking of a famous code from 1898 created by Commandant Bazeries, a brilliant French Army Cryptanalyst.
* [[Helen Fouché Gaines|Gaines, Helen Fouché]] (1939). ''Cryptanalysis'', Dover, {{ISBN|0-486-20097-3}}. Considered one of the classic books on the subject, and includes many sample ciphertext for practice. It reflects public amateur practice as of the inter-War period. The book was compiled as one of the first projects of the [[American Cryptogram Association]].
* Konheim, Alan G. (1981). ''Cryptography: A Primer'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0-471-08132-9}}. Written by one of the IBM team who developed [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]].
* Patterson, Wayne (1987). ''Mathematical Cryptology for Computer Scientists and Mathematicians'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, {{ISBN|0-8476-7438-X}}
* Welsh, Dominic (1988). ''Codes and Cryptography'', Oxford University Press, A brief textbook intended for undergraduates. Some coverage of fundamental information theory. Requires some [[mathematical maturity]]; is well written, and otherwise accessible.
* [[Bruce Schneier|Schneier, Bruce]] (1996). ''Applied Cryptography'', 2 ed, Wiley, ({{ISBN|0-471-11709-9}}). The most accessible single volume available covering modern cryptographic practice, and approachable by the non mathematically oriented.  Extensive bibliography which can serve as an entry into the modern literature. It is a great book for beginners but note that it is getting a bit dated—many important schemes such as AES or the eSTREAM candidates are missing entirely, others like elliptic curves are only very briefly treated. Less immediately mathematical than some others, e.g. Menezes et al. ''Handbook of Applied Cryptography''.
* A. J. [[Alfred Menezes|Menezes]], P. C. [[Paul van Oorschot|van Oorschot]], and S. A. [[Scott Vanstone|Vanstone]] (1996) ''Handbook of Applied Cryptography'' {{ISBN|0-8493-8523-7}} ([http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/ online version]). Equivalent to ''Applied Cryptography'' in many ways, but somewhat more mathematical. For the technically inclined. Covers few meta-cryptographic topics, such as [[crypto system]] design. This is currently (2004) regarded{{Who|date=October 2009}} as the standard reference work in technical cryptography.&lt;ref name="LandauReview"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Landau, Susan|authorlink=Susan Landau|title=Review of ''Handbook of Applied Cryptography'' by A. J. Menezes, P. C. Oorschot, and S. A. Vanstone and 9 other books by various authors|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.)|year=2004|volume=41|issue=3|pages=357–367|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2004-41-03/S0273-0979-04-01011-0/S0273-0979-04-01011-0.pdf|doi=10.1090/s0273-0979-04-01011-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mel, H.X., and Baker, Doris (2001). ''Cryptography Decrypted'', Addison Wesley {{ISBN|0-201-61647-5}}. This technical overview of basic cryptographic components (including extensive diagrams and graphics) explains the evolution of cryptography from the simplest concepts to some modern concepts. It details the basics of symmetric key, and asymmetric key ciphers, MACs, SSL, secure mail and IPsec. No math background is required, though there's some public key mathematics in the appendix.
* [[Niels Ferguson|Ferguson, Niels]], and [[Bruce Schneier|Schneier, Bruce]] (2003). ''Practical Cryptography'', Wiley, {{ISBN|0-471-22357-3}}.  A cryptosystem design consideration primer. Covers both algorithms and protocols. This is an in-depth consideration of one cryptographic problem, including paths not taken and some reasons why. At the time of its publication, most of the material was not otherwise available in a single source. Some was not otherwise available at all. According to the authors, it is (in some sense) a follow-up to ''Applied Cryptography''.
* Washington, Lawrence C. (2003). ''Elliptic Curves: Number Theory and Cryptography'' {{ISBN|1-58488-365-0}}.  A book focusing on [[elliptic curves]], beginning at an undergraduate level (at least for those who have had a course on [[abstract algebra]]), and progressing into much more advanced topics, even at the end touching on [[Andrew Wiles]]' proof of the [[Taniyama–Shimura conjecture]] which led to the proof of [[Fermat's last theorem]].
* Mao, Wenbo (2004). ''Modern Cryptography Theory and Practice'' {{ISBN|0-13-066943-1}}. An up-to-date book on cryptography. Touches on provable security, and written with students and practitioners in mind.
* [[Nigel Smart (Cryptographer)|Smart, Nigel]] (2004). ''Cryptography: An introduction'' {{ISBN|0-07-709987-7}} ([http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~nigel/Crypto_Book/ online version]). Similar in intent to ''Applied Cryptography'' but less comprehensive. Covers more modern material and is aimed at undergraduates covering topics such as [[number theory]] and [[group theory]] not generally covered in cryptography books.
* Stinson, Douglas (2005). ''Cryptography: Theory and Practice'' {{ISBN|1-58488-508-4}}.  Covers topics in a textbook style but with more mathematical detail than is usual.
* Katz, Jonathan and Yehuda Lindell (2007). ''Introduction to Modern Cryptography'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/imc.html&lt;/ref&gt; CRC Press. Presents modern cryptography at a level appropriate for undergraduates, graduate students, or practitioners. Assumes mathematical maturity but presents all the necessary mathematical and computer science background.
* Paar, Christof and Jan Pelzl (2009). ''[http://www.cryptography-textbook.com Understanding Cryptography: A Textbook for Students and Practitioners]'', Springer, {{ISBN|978-3-642-04100-6}} (companion website includes 2 semesters of video lectures, slides and sample book chapters). Very accessible introduction to applied cryptography which covers most schemes of practical relevance. The focus is on being a textbook, i.e., it has pedagogical approach, many problems and further reading sections. The main target audience are readers without a background in pure mathematics.
* Mike Rosulek (2018). ''[http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~rosulekm/crypto/ The Joy of Cryptography]'' Presents modern cryptography at a level appropriate for undergraduates.


===Cryptographic environment/context or security===
* [[Bruce Schneier|Schneier, Bruce]] – ''Secrets and Lies'', Wiley, {{ISBN|0-471-25311-1}}, a discussion of the context within which cryptography and cryptosystems work. ''Practical Cryptography'' also includes some contextual material in the discussion of [[crypto system]] design.
*  [[Bruce Schneier|Schneier, Bruce]] – ''[[Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World]]'', Wiley, {{ISBN|0-387-02620-7}}
* [[Ross J. Anderson|Ross Anderson]] – ''Security Engineering'', Wiley, {{ISBN|0-471-38922-6}} ([http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/%7Erja14/book.html online version]), advanced coverage of computer security issues, including cryptography. Covers much more than merely cryptography. Brief on most topics due to the breadth of coverage. Well written, especially compared to the usual standard.
* [[Jon Edney|Edney, Jon]] and [[William A. Arbaugh|Arbaugh, William A]] – ''Real 802.11 Security: Wi-Fi Protected Access and 802.11i'', Addison-Wesley, {{ISBN|0-321-13620-9}}, covers the use of cryptography in [[Wi-Fi]] networks.  Includes details on [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]] (which is based on the IEEE [[802.11i]] specification).  The book is slightly out of date as it was written before IEEE 802.11i was finalized but much of the content is still useful for those who want to find out how encryption and authentication is done in a Wi-Fi network.

===Declassified works===
*[[Lambros D. Callimahos|Callimahos, Lambros D.]] and [[William F. Friedman|Friedman, William F.]] [[Military Cryptanalytics]]. A (partly) declassified text intended as a training manual for [[National Security Agency|NSA]] cryptanalysts.

===History of cryptography===
* [[James Bamford|Bamford, James]], ''[[The Puzzle Palace]]: A Report on America's Most Secret Agency'' ({{ISBN|0-14-006748-5}}), and the more recent ''[[Body of Secrets|Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency]]''. The first is one of a very few books about the US Government's NSA. The second is also about NSA but concentrates more on its history. There is some very interesting material in ''Body of Secrets'' about US attempts (the [[TICOM]] mission) to investigate German cryptographic efforts immediately as WW II wound down.
* [[Gustave Bertrand]], ''Enigma ou la plus grande énigme de la guerre 1939–1945'' (Enigma:  the Greatest Enigma of the War of 1939–1945), Paris, 1973. The first public disclosure in the West of the breaking of Enigma, by the chief of French military cryptography prior to WW II. The first public disclosure anywhere was made in the first edition of ''Bitwa o tajemnice'' by the late Władysław Kozaczuk.
* [[James Gannon]], ''Stealing Secrets, Telling Lies:  How Spies and Codebreakers Helped Shape the Twentieth Century'', Washington, D.C., Brassey's, 2001:  an overview of major 20th-century episodes in [[cryptology]] and [[espionage]], particularly strong regarding the misappropriation of credit for conspicuous achievements.
* [[David Kahn (writer)|Kahn, David]] – ''[[The Codebreakers]]'' ({{ISBN|0-684-83130-9}}) A single-volume source for cryptographic history, at least for events up to the mid-'60s (i.e., to just before DES and the public release of [[asymmetric key cryptography]]). The added chapter on more recent developments (in the most recent edition) is quite thin. Kahn has written other books and articles on cryptography, and on cryptographic history. They are very highly regarded.
* [[Władysław Kozaczuk|Kozaczuk, Władysław]], ''Enigma:  How the German Machine Cipher Was Broken, and How It Was Read by the Allies in World War II'', edited and translated by [[Christopher Kasparek]], Frederick, MD, 1984: a history of cryptological efforts against Enigma, concentrating on the contributions of Polish mathematicians [[Marian Rejewski]], [[Jerzy Różycki]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]]; of particular interest to specialists will be several technical appendices by Rejewski.
* Levy, Steven – ''[[Crypto: How the Code Rebels Beat the Government—Saving Privacy in the Digital Age]]'' ({{ISBN|0-14-024432-8}}):  a journalistic overview of the development of public cryptographic techniques and the US regulatory context for cryptography. This is an account of a major policy conflict.
* [[Simon Singh|Singh, Simon]], ''[[The Code Book]]'' ({{ISBN|1-85702-889-9}}):  an anecdotal introduction to the history of cryptography. Covers more recent material than does even the revised edition of Kahn's ''The Codebreakers''. Clearly written and quite readable. The included cryptanalytic contest has been won and the prize awarded, but the cyphertexts are still worth attempting.
* Bauer, F L, ''Decrypted Secrets'', This book is unusual. It is both a history of cryptography, and a discussion of mathematical topics related to cryptography. In his review, David Kahn said he thought it the best book he'd read on the subject. It is essentially two books, in more or less alternating chapters. Originally in German, and the translation shows it in places. Some surprising content, e.g., in the discussion of President Edgar &lt;!-- NB: this is not an error. There is a reference in the book to this 'President'. --&gt;Hoover's Secretary of State, Henry Stimson.
* [[Stephen Budiansky|Budiansky, Stephen]], ''Battle of Wits'':  a one-volume history of cryptography in WW II. It is well written, well researched, and responsible. Technical material (e.g., a description of the cryptanalysis of [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]]) is limited, but clearly presented.
* [[Stephen Budiansky|Budiansky, Stephen]], ''Code Warriors: NSA's Codebreakers and the Secret Intelligence War Against the Soviet Union'' (Knopf, 2016). ({{ISBN|0385352662}}): A sweeping, in-depth history of NSA, whose famous “cult of silence” has left the agency shrouded in mystery for decades.
* Prados, John – ''Combined Fleet Decoded'', An account of cryptography in the Pacific Theatre of World War II with special emphasis on the Japanese side. Reflects extensive research in Japanese sources and recently available US material. Contains material not previously accessible or unavailable.
* [[Leo Marks|Marks, Leo]], ''Between Silk and Cyanide: a Codemaker's Story, 1941–1945,'' (HarperCollins, 1998). ({{ISBN|0-684-86780-X}}). A humorous but informative account of code-making and -breaking in Britain's [[World War II|WWII]] [[Special Operations Executive]].
*[[Herbert Yardley|Yardley, Herbert]], ''The American Black Chamber'' ({{ISBN|0-345-29867-5}}),  a classic 1931 account of American code-breaking during and after [[World War I]]; and ''Chinese Black Chamber: An Adventure in Espionage'' ({{ISBN|0-395-34648-7}}), about Yardley's work with the Chinese government in the years just before [[World War II]].  Yardley has an enduring reputation for embellishment, and some of the material in these books is less than reliable.   ''The American Black Chamber'' was written after the New York operation Yardley ran was shut down by Secretary of State [[Henry L. Stimson]] and the US Army, on the grounds that "gentlemen don't read each other's mail".

===Historic works===

[[File:State Gifts Chess Set.JPG|thumb|right|250px|In 1972, former [[President of Pakistan]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Zulfi Bhutto]] gifted a carved ivory set of chess to the former [[United States President]] [[Gerald Ford]].]]
[[Chess]] became a source of inspiration in the arts in literature soon after the spread of the game to the [[Arab World]] and [[Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. The earliest works of art centered on the game are [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] in medieval manuscripts, as well as poems, which were often created with the purpose of describing the [[rules of chess|rules]]. After chess gained popularity in the 15th and 16th centuries, many works of art related to the game were created. One of the most well-known,&lt;ref name=Litmanowicz-1974-p13 /&gt; [[Marco Girolamo Vida]]'s ''Scacchia ludus'', written in 1527, made such an impression on the readers that it singlehandedly inspired other authors to create poems about chess.&lt;ref name=Litmanowicz-1974-p13 /&gt;

In the 20th century, artists created many works related to the game, sometimes taking their inspiration from the life of famous players ([[Vladimir Nabokov]] in ''[[The Defense]]'') or  well-known games ([[Poul Anderson]] in ''Immortal Game'', [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]] in ''[[The Squares of the City]]''). Some authors invented new [[chess variant]]s in their works, such as [[Games of the Discworld#Stealth Chess|stealth chess]] in [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' series or [[Three-dimensional chess#Tri-Dimensional Chess|Tri-Dimensional chess]] in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series.

==History==

===10th to 18th century===
[[File:Alfonso-LJ-27V.jpg|thumb|Some of the earliest examples of chess-related art are [[Middle Ages|medieval]] illustrations accompanying books or manuscripts, such as this [[chess problem]] from the 1283 ''[[Libro de los juegos]]'']]
[[File:The Chess Game - Sofonisba Anguissola.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sofonisba Anguissola]], ''The Chess Game,'', 1555, [[National Museum, Poznań]], [[Poland]]]]
Palatine Chapel in the Norman Palace in [[Palermo]] you can admire the first painting of a chess game that is known to the world. The work dates from around 1143 and the artists who created the Muslims were chosen by the Norman king of Sicily Roger II of Hauteville, who erected the church.
The earliest known reference to chess in a European text is a [[Medieval Latin]] poem, ''[[Versus de scachis]]''. The oldest manuscript containing this poem has been given the estimated date of 997.&lt;ref name=Speculum&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gamer |first1=Helena M. |year=1954 |title=The Earliest Evidence of Chess in Western Literature: The Einsiedeln Verses |journal=[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]] |publisher= |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages= 734–750|url= |doi= 10.2307/2847098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early examples include [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] accompanying books. Some of them have high artistic value. Perhaps the best known example is the 13th-century ''[[Libro de los juegos]]''. The book contains 151 illustrations, and while most of them are centered on the board, showing [[chess problem|problems]], the players and architectural settings are different in each picture.&lt;ref name=Golladay-p657&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etd.library.arizona.edu/etd/GetFileServlet?file=file:///data1/pdf/etd/azu_etd_2444_1_m.pdf&amp;type=application/pdf |title=Los Libros de Acedrex Dados E Tablas: Historical, Artistic and Metaphysical Dimensions of Alfonso X’s Book of Games |author=Sonja Musser Golladay |year=2007 |work= |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=6 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717133812/http://etd.library.arizona.edu/etd/GetFileServlet?file=file%3A%2F%2F%2Fdata1%2Fpdf%2Fetd%2Fazu_etd_2444_1_m.pdf&amp;type=application%2Fpdf# |archive-date=2011-07-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pieces illustrating chess problems in [[Luca Pacioli]]'s manuscript ''[[De ludo scacchorum]]'' ({{lang-la|On the Game of Chess}}) (c. 1500), described as "futuristic" even by today's standards,&lt;ref name=Winnipeg&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/historic/32762994.html |title=Experts link Leonardo da Vinci to chess puzzles in Renaissance treatise |author= |date=14 March 2008 |newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press |accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; may have been designed by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref name=Winnipeg /&gt;&lt;ref name=Keene&gt;{{cite news

After chess became gradually more popular in Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries, especially in Spain and Italy, many artists began writing poems using chess as a theme.&lt;ref name=Litmanowicz-1974-p11&gt;Litmanowicz (1974), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Scachs d'amor]]'' ({{lang-ca|Chess of love}}), written by an unknown artist in the end of the 15th century, describes a game between [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], using chess as an [[allegory]] of love. The story also serves as a pretence to describe the rules of the game. ''De ludo scacchorum'' (unrelated to the manuscript mentioned above) by {{Interlanguage link multi|Francesco Bernardino Caldogno|it}}, also created at that time, is a collection of gameplay advice, presented in poetic fashion.&lt;ref name=Litmanowicz-1974-p12&gt;Litmanowicz (1974), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Terni Scacchi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terniscacchi.com/scacchi-scuola/scacchi-elenco-romanzi-racconti.htm |title=Elenco romanzi e racconti sul gioco degli scacchi |trans-title=List of novels and short stories on chess |author= |date= |work=Terni Scacchi |publisher= |accessdate=2 August 2010|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most influential&lt;ref name=Litmanowicz-1974-p13&gt;Litmanowicz (1974), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  works of chess-related art is [[Marco Girolamo Vida]]'s ''Scaccia ludus'' (1527), centered on a game played between [[Apollo]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] on [[Mount Olympus]]. It is said that, because of its high artistry, the poem made a great impression on anyone who read it, including [[Desiderius Erasmus]].&lt;ref name=Litmanowicz-1974-p13 /&gt; It also directly inspired at least two other works.&lt;ref name=Litmanowicz-1974-p14&gt;Litmanowicz (1974), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The first is [[Jan Kochanowski]]'s poem ''[[Chess (poem)|Chess]]'' (c. 1565), which describes the game as a battle between two armies, while the second is [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones']]'' [[William Jones (philologist)#Latin chess poem|Caissa, or the game of chess]]'' (1772). The latter poem popularised the pseudo-ancient Greek [[dryad]] [[Caïssa]] to be the "goddess of chess".&lt;ref name=Litmanowicz-1974-p14 /&gt;

=== 19th century onwards ===
Since the 19th century, artists have been creating novels and – since the 20th century – films related to chess. Sometimes, they are inspired by famous games, like [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]]'s ''[[The Squares of the City]]'', structured after the famous match between [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] and [[Mikhail Chigorin]]; [[Poul Anderson]]'s short story ''Immortal Game'', inspired by [[Immortal Game|the 1851 game]] played by [[Adolf Anderssen]] and [[Lionel Kieseritzky]] (which also appears in the film ''[[Blade Runner]]''); or [[Waldemar Łysiak]]'s ''Szachista'' ({{lang-pl|The Chess Player}}), centered on a game played between [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and [[The Turk]]. The game [[Poole – HAL 9000|Frank Poole versus HAL 9000]] from the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' is also based on an actual match, albeit not widely known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1254321&amp;kpage=1 Roesch vs Willi Schlage (1910)] in [[chessgames.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists drawn their inspirations from the life of players. [[Vladimir Nabokov]] wrote ''[[The Defense]]'' after learning about [[Curt von Bardeleben]],&lt;ref name=Krabbe&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~timkr/chess2/diary_1.htm |title=Open chess diary 1-20 (entry 3) |author=[[Tim Krabbé]] |date= |work=Tim Krabbé's blog |publisher= |accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the musical ''[[Chess (musical)|Chess]]'' was loosely based on the life of [[Bobby Fischer]].&lt;ref name=musical&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/08/theater/theater-does-anyone-make-a-bad-move-in-chess.html |title=Does Anyone Make a Bad Move In 'Chess'? |accessdate=2008-04-27 |date=8 May 1998 |author=[[Harold C. Schonberg]] |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors invented new [[chess variant]]s in their works, such as [[Games of the Discworld#Stealth Chess|stealth chess]] in [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' series or [[Three-dimensional chess#Tri-Dimensional Chess|Tri-Dimensional chess]] in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series.

One unusual connection between art and chess is the life of [[Marcel Duchamp]], who almost fully [[Marcel Duchamp#Transition from art to chess|suspended his artistic career]] to focus on chess in 1923.

==In painting==
As the popularity of the game became widespread during the 15th and 16th centuries, so too did the number of paintings depicting the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Władysław Litmanowicz, ''Dykteryjki i ciekawostki szachowe'' (Chess trivia and anecdotes), in Polish. Warsaw: Sport i Turystyka. 1974, pp. 11–27&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing into the 20th century, artists created works related to the game often taking inspiration from the life of famous players or well-known games. An unusual connection between art and chess is the life of [[Marcel Duchamp]], who in 1923 almost fully [[Marcel Duchamp#Transition from art to chess|suspended his artistic career]] to focus on chess.&lt;ref&gt;"Marcel Duchamp."

==Contributions to Sociology==
It has been stated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cipriani|first1=Roberto|title=Manual de Sociología de la Religión|date=2011|publisher=Siglo Veintiuno Editores|location=Buenos Aires|isbn=978-987-629-194-1|page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that the work of C. Parker enables a complete knowledge of popular culture with an empathic and participative approach on the “culture of the poor”. His contribution to the sociology of religion, underscoring its cultural character, rich in creativity, has led to the reevaluation of lived religion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGuire|first1=Meredith|title=Lived Religion. Faith and Practice in Everyday Life|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195368338|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., to the noninstitutional character of religion. That is why his criticisms of the ecclesiocentric bias of the sociology of western religion have been the subject of relevant publications.
According to Roberto Cipriani, Cristián Parker in his work “has analyzed with scientífic rigor the crossing of popular and official culture, revealing congruences and incongruences, points of contact and contrast through theoretical and empirical work made along a trip that has lasted 30 years, aimed at discovering what he calls the “other logic” of popular culture (...). On the other hand, an extensive analysis of the relation between religion and politics from a democratic perspective is not missing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cipriani|first1=Roberto|title=Manual de Sociología de la Religión|date=2011|publisher=Siglo Veintiuno Editores|location=Buenos Aires|isbn=978-987-629-194-1|page=365}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of C. Parker is consulted by specialists and those interested in Latin America’s sociocultural and religious evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Llambías|first1=Jaime|title=América Latina : interrogantes y prespectivas|date=2013|publisher=York University Bookstore|location=Toronto|isbn=978-1-55014-583-0|pages=205–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Parker has contributed to the sociology of development, especially in his analysis of new ways of understanding the relation between culture and development. In particular, he has conducted research on the social representations of social actors challenged by the radical scientific and technological innovations in the context of unequal globalization and on the environmental crisis, climate change, and energy transition in South American societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Cristian|last2=Letelier|first2=Mario|last3=Muñoz|first3=Juan|title=Elites, climate change and agency in a developing society: the Chilean case|journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability|date=20 March 2013|volume=15|issue=5|pages=1337–1363|doi=10.1007/s10668-013-9444-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social commitment==
During the time in which Chile was governed under the dictatorship of General [[Augusto Pinochet]], he became an active actor of a Catholic church and of the ecumenical efforts in defense of human rights and the return to democracy. In those days he became committed with the Church's base communities that fought inspired by the Liberation Theology.
As the country turned to democracy, and after the [[Chilean national plebiscite, 1988]] and the election of [[Patricio Aylwin]] as president of the democratic Concertación, he oriented his life toward academic work.
During this time he has contributed in key and strategic issues of the social sciences for the construction of democracy in Chile: development of indigenous people, overcoming poverty, social and political participation of youngsters, ethics and democracy, and the challenges of climate change and sustainable development.

There is a rich and ancient culture in [[Eastern Arabia]] ([[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]). Eastern Arabia's culture has always been [[Seafaring|oriented towards the sea]].&lt;ref name="an"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsU798UPaeYC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq|title=Iranians in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates|work=Eric Andrew McCoy|pages=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; While being [[Arab culture|Arab]] at its core, it has been heavily influenced by the cultures of [[Persian culture|Persia]], [[South Asian culture|South Asia]] and [[Horn of Africa]], because of extensive [[trade]] links.

The semiannual tradition of [[Qarqe'an]] (قرقيعان) is deeply rooted in Gulf culture. The [[Arab cuisine of the Persian Gulf|cuisine of the region]] includes [[seafood]] (including [[mahyawa]]), [[harees]], [[khubz]] and [[biryani]]. Other cultural features of the region include [[Badgeer|windcatchers (Badgeer)]] (barajeel) and [[Dewaniya]].

==Overview==
Cultures in the region include those of [[Culture of Bahrain|Bahrain]], [[Culture of Kuwait|Kuwait]], [[UAE]], Eastern Saudi Arabia ([[Qatif]] and [[Al-Hasa]]), [[Qatar]], [[Southern Iraq]] and [[Culture of Oman|Northern Oman]].

==Gargee'an==
{{See also|Gargee'an}}
Qarqe'an is an semiannual celebration, observed in Eastern Arabia, that takes place on the 15th night of [[Sha'ban]] and on the 15th night of [[Ramadan]]. Gerga'oon is marked with children dressing in traditional attire and going door-to-door to receive [[sweets]] from neighbours, whilst also singing traditional songs. The tradition has existed for hundreds of years and deeply rooted in Gulf culture.&lt;ref name=BNA&gt;{{cite news|title=القرقاعون من أهم الاحتفالات الرمضانية الشعبية في مملكة البحرين|url=http://www.bna.bh/portal/news/519354|accessdate=3 February 2013|newspaper=[[Bahrain News Agency]]|date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the celebration of Qarqe'an shares superficial similarities with the [[Halloween]] custom of [[trick-or-treating]], practiced in some western countries, Qarqe'an has no connection with horror and no associated origin with Halloween.

==Music==
A variety of music and dance forms are practised in the region, including [[Fijiri]], [[Fann At-Tanbura]], [[Sawt (music)|Sawt]], [[Khaliji (music)|contemporary Khaliji music]], [[Yowla]] and [[Liwa (music)|Liwa]].

;Musical instruments
Traditional instruments include the [[Oud]], along with a variety of [[drum]]s and the ''[[manjur (instrument)|manjur]]''. The ''[[Tanbūra (lyre)|Tanbūra]]'' lyre is also used.

==Languages==
A number of different dialects of Arabic are spoken in the region, including [[Gulf Arabic]] and [[Bahrani Arabic]]. The [[Kumzari dialect|Lurs language of Kumzari]] is also spoken by [[Omani people]] of [[Musandam Peninsula]]. Kumzari is the only Iranian language native to the Arab world.

==Cuisine==
{{See also|Arab cuisine of the Persian Gulf}}
The cuisine of the region includes [[Harees]],&lt;ref&gt;Charles Perry, "Cooking with the Caliphs", ''Saudi Aramco World'' '''57''':4 (July/August 2006) [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200604/cooking.with.the.caliphs.htm full text]&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[seafood]]''' (including [[mahyawa]]), [[Biryani]] and [[Ghormeh sabzi|Sabzi]].

&lt;!--This ragbag list really needs to be broken up into useful sections, i.e. completely rewritten.--&gt;
Other cultural features of the region include [[Qarqe'an]], [[Badgeer]] wind towers, [[Bukhoor]] and [[Dewaniya]].

==Institutions==
Cultural institutions of the region include the television network [[Al Jazeera]],&lt;ref&gt;Zayani, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; broadcast from Qatar, and competitor [[Al Arabiya]], broadcast from Saudi Arabia.

The '''Dahomey Amazons''' or '''''Mino''''', which means "our mothers," were a [[Fon people|Fon]] all-female military regiment of the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]] in the present-day [[Republic of Benin]] which lasted until the end of the 19th century. They were so named by Western observers and historians due to their similarity to the mythical [[Amazons]] of ancient [[Anatolia]] and the [[Black Sea]].

==Origin==
[[File:Dahomey amazon2.jpg|right|frame|Dahomey Amazons in around 1890]]
King [[Houegbadja]] (who ruled from 1645 to 1685), the third King of [[Dahomey]], is said to have originally started the group which would become the Amazons as a corps of elephant hunters called the ''gbeto''.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=20}}

Houegbadja's son King [[Agaja]] (ruling from 1708 to 1732) established a female bodyguard armed with muskets. European merchants recorded their presence. According to tradition, Agaja developed the bodyguard into a militia and successfully used them in Dahomey's defeat of the neighbouring kingdom of [[Savi]] in 1727.{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} The group of female warriors was referred to as ''Mino'', meaning "Our Mothers" in the [[Fon language]], by the male army of Dahomey.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=44}} Other sources contest that King Agaja's older sister Queen Hangbe was the ruler to establish the units, however some contest if Queen Hangbe actually existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20180826-the-legend-of-benins-fearless-female-warriors|title=The legend of Benin’s fearless female warriors|last=Macdonald|first=Fleur|language=en|access-date=2018-08-26|date=2018-08-26|website=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of King [[Ghezo]] (ruling from 1818 to 1858), Dahomey became increasingly militaristic. Ghezo placed great importance on the army, increasing its budget and formalizing its structure from ceremonial to a serious military. While European narratives refer to the women soldiers as "Amazons", they called themselves ''ahosi'' (king's wives) or ''Mino'' (our mothers).{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} Europeans exchanged goods such as knives, bayonets, firearms and fabrics for prisoners that the Dahomey captured during wars and raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/m02fdq|title=Dahomey - Google Arts &amp; Culture|work=Google Cultural Institute|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recruitment==
[[File:Dahomey amazon1.jpg|thumb|[[Seh-Dong-Hong-Beh]], a leader of the Amazons]]
Ghezo recruited both men and women soldiers from foreign captives, though women soldiers were also recruited from free Dahomean women, some enrolled as young as 8 years old.{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} Other accounts indicate that the ''Mino'' were recruited from among the ''ahosi'' ("king's wives") of which there were often hundreds.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=38}} Some women in Fon society became soldiers voluntarily, while others were [[conscription|involuntarily enrolled]] if their husbands or fathers complained to the king about their behavior.

Membership among the ''Mino'' was supposed to hone any aggressive character traits for the purpose of war. During their membership they were not allowed to have children or be part of married life (though they were legally married to the king). Many of them were virgins. The regiment had a semi-sacred status, which was intertwined with the [[Fon people|Fon]] belief in [[Vodun]].

The ''Mino'' trained with intense physical exercise. They learnt survival skills and indifference to pain and death, storming [[acacia]]-thorn defenses in [[military exercises]] and executing prisoners.{{sfn|Dash|2011}} Discipline was emphasised.

Serving in the ''Mino'' offered women the opportunity to "rise to positions of command and influence" in an environment structured for individual empowerment.{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} The ''Mino'' were also wealthy and held high status.{{sfn|Dash|2011}}

==Political role==
The ''Mino'' took a prominent role in the Grand Council, debating the policy of the kingdom. From the 1840s to 1870s (when the opposing party collapsed), they generally supported peace with [[Abeokuta]] and stronger commercial relations with England, favouring the trade in [[palm oil]] above that in slaves; this set them at odds with their male military colleagues.{{sfn|Yoder|1974}}

Apart from the Council, the [[Annual Customs of Dahomey]] included a parade and reviewing of the troops, and the troops swearing of an oath to the king. The celebrations on the 27th day of the Annual Customs  consisted of a mock battle in which the Amazons attacked a "fort" and "captured" the slaves within,{{sfn|Yoder|1974}} a custom recorded by the priest Francesco Borghero in his diaries.{{sfn|Dash|2011}}

==Combat and structure==
The women soldiers were rigorously trained and given uniforms. By the mid-19th century, they numbered between 1,000 and 6,000 women, about a third of the entire Dahomey army, according to reports written by visitors. These documented reports also indicated that the women soldiers suffered several defeats.

The women soldiers were said to be structured in parallel with the army as a whole, with a center wing (the king's bodyguards) flanked on both sides, each under separate commanders. Some accounts note that each male soldier had a female warrior counterpart.{{sfn|Law|1993|p=}} In an 1849/50 account by an Englishman, it was documented that the women that had three stripes of [[whitewash]] around each leg, were honored with marks of distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dahomey And The Dahomans: Being The Journals Of Two Missions To The King Of Dahomey And Residence At His Capital 1849 To 1850|last=Forbes|first=Frederick|publisher=Kessinger Publishing LLC|year=2010|isbn=978-1163235027|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women's army consisted of a number of regiments: huntresses, riflewomen, reapers, archers, and gunners. Each regiment had different uniforms, weapons and commanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/womeninafrica/women-soldiers-dahomey/pedagogical-unit/4|title=The women soldiers of Dahomey pedagogical unit 4 {{!}} Women|website=en.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter period, the Dahomean female warriors were armed with Winchester rifles, clubs and knives. Units were under female command. A 1851 published translation of a war chant of the women claims the warriors would chant, "a[s] the [[blacksmith]] takes an iron bar and by fire changes its fashion so have we changed our nature. We are no longer women, we are men."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adams|first=Maeve|date=Spring 2010|title=The Amazon Warrior Women and the De/construction of Gendered Imperial Authority in Nineteenth-Century Colonial Literature|url=http://m.ncgsjournal.com/issue61/New%20PDFs/NCGS%20Journal%20Issue%206.1%20-%20The%20Amazon%20Warrior%20Woman%20-%20Maeve%20E.%20Adams.pdf|journal=Nineteenth-Century Gender Studies|volume=6|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Conflict with neighbouring kingdoms===
The Dahomey kingdom was [[History of the Kingdom of Dahomey|often at war]] with its neighbors, and captives were needed for the [[History of slavery|slave trade]]. The Dahomey women soldiers fought in slave raids, as referenced in the Zora Neale Hurston non-fiction work  [[Barracoon: The Story of the Last "Black Cargo"|Baracoon]], and in the unsuccessful wars against [[Abeokuta]].

==Conflict with France==

=== First Franco-Dahomean War ===
European encroachment into West Africa gained pace during the latter half of the 19th century, and in 1890 King [[Béhanzin]] started fighting French forces in the course of the [[First Franco-Dahomean War]]. European observers noted that they "handled admirably" in hand to hand combat, but that they did not know how to use their flintlocks.{{sfn|Dash|2011}} The Amazons participated in one major battle: Cotonou, where thousands of Dahoney (including many Amazons) charged the French lines and engaged the defenders in hand-to-hand combat. Despite the compliments given to them by the Europeans, the Amazons were decisively crushed, with several hundred Dahomey troops being gunned down while 129 Dahomey were killed in melee combat within the French lines. The French lost 5 men killed and a few dozen wounded.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=195}} 

=== Second Franco-Dahomean War ===
According to Holmes, many of the French soldiers fighting in Dahomey hesitated before shooting or bayoneting the Amazons. The resulting delay led to many of the French casualties. By the end of the [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]], special units of the Amazons were being assigned specifically to target French officers.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=|pp=205}} After several battles, the French prevailed in the [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]] and put an end to the independent Dahomean kingdom. The legionnaires were impressed by the boldness of the Amazons and later wrote about the "incredible courage and audacity." Against a military unit with decidedly superior weaponry and a longer bayonet, however, the Dahomey Amazons could not prevail.&lt;ref&gt;Yoder, John C. (1974). "Fly and Elephant Parties: Political Polarization in Dahomey, 1840-1870". The Journal of African History. 15 (3): 417–432. doi:10.1017/s0021853700013566. &lt;/ref&gt; During a battle with French soldiers at [[Second Franco-Dahomean War#Battle of Adégon|Adegon]] on October 6 during the second war, the bulk of the Amazon corps were wiped out in a matter of hours in hand-to-hand combat after the French engaged them with a bayonet charge. For the loss of 86 Regulars and 417 Amazons, the Dahomey only managed to kill 6 French troops in the melee.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|p=203}}

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Groepsportret van de zogenaamde 'Amazones uit Dahomey' tijdens hun verblijf in Parijs TMnr 60038362.jpg|thumb|COLLECTION TROPEN MUSEUM Group portrait of the so-called 'Amazons from Dahomey' during their stay in Paris.]]

==Disbandment==
[[File:The célébration at Abomey(1908). - The veteran amazones( AHOSI ) of the Fon king Béhanzin, Son of Roi Gélé.jpg|Veterans at in 1908.|thumb|Veterans at the annual meeting in Abomay in 1908]]
The troops were disbanded when the kingdom became a French [[protectorate]].{{sfn|Historical Museum of Abomey}} Oral tradition states that some surviving amazons secretly remained in Abomey afterwards, where they quietly assassinated a number of French officers. Other stories say the women pledged their services in protection of [[Agoli-agbo|Agoli-Agbo]], the brother of [[Béhanzin]], disguising themselves as his wives in order to guard him.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|pp=208-209}}

Some of the women married and had children, while others remained single. According to a historian who traced the lives of almost two dozen ex-amazons, all the women displayed difficulties adjusting to life as retired warriors, often struggling to find new roles in their communities that gave them a sense of pride comparable to their former lives. Many displayed a tendency to start fights or arguments that frightened their neighbours and relatives.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|pp=208-209}}

Between 1934 and 1942, several British travelers in [[Abomey]] recorded encounters with ex-amazons, now old women who spun cotton or idled around courtyards.{{sfn|Alpern|1998|pp=210-211}} The last survivor of the Dahomey Amazons is thought to have been a woman named Nawi. In a 1978 interview with a [[Benin|Beninese]] historian, Nawi claimed to have fought the French in 1892. Nawi died in November 1979, aged well over 100.{{sfn|Dash|2011}}

==In popular culture==

{{in popular culture|date=October 2018}}{{refimprove|date=October 2018}}
Dahomey Amazons were represented in the 1987 film ''[[Cobra Verde]]'' by [[German people|German]] director [[Werner Herzog]]. Ghezo's Amazons play a significant role in the novel ''[[Flash for Freedom!]]'' by [[George MacDonald Fraser]].

The unit is also depicted in (a special edition of, and now [[Downloadable content|DLC]] of) PC game ''[[Empire: Total War]]''. In the African Kingdoms expansion to ''[[Age of Empires II]]'', Gbeto are the Malian unique unit. In either game, the Dahomey/Gbeto are the only female military units.

A segment of ''[[QI]]'' Series 7 Episode 7 discussed Dahomey Amazons and showed a photo.

Referenced in [[Stieg Larsson]]'s novel ''[[The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest]]'' in the prelude to Part 4 ''Rebooting System''.

The warriors are also mentioned in [[Patrick O'Brian]]'s novel ''[[The Commodore]]'', book 17 of the [[Aubrey-Maturin series]].

The main character of [[Charles R. Saunders]] fantasy novel ''Dossouye'', an ahosi of Abomey, is closely modelled on the Dahomey ahosi.

[[P. C. Wren]]'s 1917 book of short stories ''[[Stepsons of France]]'' contains a story called ''"Here are Ladies"'', describing a series of clashes between troops of the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] and the Dahomey Amazons.

The warriors are also the main focus and written about in [[Layon Gray]]'s stage play ''[[Black Sparta]]''.{{sfn|Clodfelter|2017}}

The [[Dora Milaje]], army/bodyguards to the ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'', are based partially off the Dahomey Amazons.{{sfn|Johnson|2018}}

In [[Zora Neale Hurston]]’s ''[[Barracoon: The Story of the Last "Black Cargo"|Barracoon]]'', 86 year old Cudjo Lewis, the last known survivor of the slaver [[Clotilda (slave ship)|Clotilda]], describes his own capture by Dahomey Amazons when he was 19 years old.

'''''Death in the Desert: The Ted Binion Homicide Case''''' is a 2000 biographical and crime account by the American [[journalist]] and crime [[author]] [[Cathy Scott]], with a second edition in 2012. The book, which was the first of four released about the case,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2001/Feb-08-Thu-2001/living/15362184.html |title=New Book: Photo Opportunity |publisher=''Las Vegas Review-Journal'' |date=2001-01-08 |accessdate=12-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; details the homicide investigation and ensuing trial and re-trial of [[Ted Binion]]’s live-in girlfriend Sandy Murphy and her lover Rick Tabish in connection with Binion's death.

==Storyline==
The book is an in-depth look at the life and death of Lonnie Theodore "Ted" Binion, the 54-year-old heir to [[Binion's Horseshoe Casino]], who died from a drug overdose on September 17, 1998. The book seeks to resolve whether Binion was murdered by Murphy and Tabish or accidentally overdosed on drugs he had purchased in the days before his death. It includes historical photos of the Binion family from the archives of the Las Vegas News Bureau and [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]'s [[Lied Library]] "Special Collections."

The murder motive, the prosecution contended, was Binion's $50 million estate. In his will, he left Murphy $300,000 cash in addition to his $900,000 house and its contents, which included original paintings and a silver coin collection kept in a safe inside the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/1999/jul/07/court-papers-reveal-two-sides-of-tabish-murphy/ |title=Court papers reveal two sides of Tabish, Murphy |publisher=''Las Vegas Sun'' |date=July 7, 1999 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author interviewed the defendants before and after the first trial and re-trial, which was dubbed Las Vegas's "trial of the century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Nov-24-Wed-2004/news/25339516.html |title=Binion Trial Verdict: Reversal of fortunes |publisher=''Las Vegas Review-Journal'' |date=November 24, 2004 |accessdate=October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
In 2012, author [[R. Barri Flowers]] chose the chapter "Fat Herbie Blitzstein" from ''Death in the Desert'' for inclusion in the anthology ''[[Masters of True Crime]]'' released by [[Prometheus Books]] in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://truecrimezine.com/masters-of-true-crime-book-review/ |title=Review of Masters of True Crime: Chilling Stories of Murder and the Macabre edited by R. Barri Flowers |publisher=''True Crime Zine'' |date=August 22, 2012 |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Investigation Discovery]]'s series ''[[On the Case with Paula Zahn]]'' covered the case in 2009, interviewed the author, and gave the episode the same title as the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1558060/ |title=Death in the Desert |publisher=Investigation Discovery |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Scott appeared on [[Oxygen Network]]’s “Snapped” series "Women Who Kill" about defendant Murphy, which was the show's fourth season debut episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/shows/snapped-women-who-kill/videos/snapeed-women-who-kill-sandy-murphy-trial.html |title=Women Who Kill: Sandy Murphy |publisher=Crime and Investigation Network |date=October 2004 |accessdate=October 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302071803/http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/shows/snapped-women-who-kill/videos/snapeed-women-who-kill-sandy-murphy-trial.html |archivedate=March 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2004, Steve Bornfeld with the ''Las Vegas Sun'' wrote a musical spoof about the Binion case and included Scott as one of the play's three narrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/archive/2004/oct/07/binion-the-miniature-musical/ |title=Binion: The Miniature Musical |publisher=''Las Vegas Weekly'' |date=October 7, 2004 |accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==

The book was reviewed by the ''Nevada Historical Society Quarterly'' in fall 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museums.nevadaculture.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=468%3A2002&amp;catid=13%3Ahistorical-society-reno&amp;Itemid=462|title=Book Review|publisher=''Nevada Historical Society Quarterly''|date=Fall 2002|volume=45, number 3|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2001, the ''Las Vegas Mercury'' called the book "lively and informative." AmericanMafia.com in 2003 described ''Death in the Desert'' as "objective and not favoring either the prosecution or the defense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmafia.com/inside_vegas/3-3-03_Inside_Vegas.html |title=Bad Judgment |publisher=AmericanMafia.com |date=March 3, 2003 |accessdate=October 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725040136/http://www.americanmafia.com/Inside_Vegas/3-3-03_Inside_Vegas.html |archivedate=July 25, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[True Crime Zine]]'', which gave the second edition of the book a five-star review in January 2013, wrote, "Even if you’ve seen the television episodes on the case, you still want to read ''Death In The Desert'' because it’s a rollercoaster of a read. ... Just when you think it ends, it doesn’t. There’s so much more and a surprise ending."&lt;ref&gt;[http://truecrimezine.com/ted-binion-murder-book-cathy-scott/ Ted Binion book: Death in the Desert by Cathy Scott | ''True Crime Zine''&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1736">The '''East African Court of Appeal''' ('''EACA''') was a court which served as the appellate court for the British colonies in eastern Africa and west Asia.

The court was established in 1902 as the '''Eastern African Court of Appeal''' and was the appellate court for [[British Kenya]], [[Uganda Protectorate]], and [[Nyasaland]]. Later, the court's name was changed to the East African Court of Appeal, and in the 1950s to the '''Court of Appeal for East Africa''' or the '''Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa'''. The court was based in Kenya.

Over time, the jurisdiction of the court grew to become the appellate court for the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar]], [[Tanganyika (territory)|Tanganyika]], [[British Somaliland]], [[Aden Protectorate]], [[Colony of Aden]], [[British Seychelles]], and [[Saint Helena]].

Decisions of the court could be appealed with leave to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]].

The court was retained by independent [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Uganda]] as the appellate court for the [[East African Community]]. When the Community was abolished in 1977, so too was the court.

== Mission and objectives ==
The East Stratcom Team is intended to develop dedicated communication material on priority issues, where EU [[strategic communication]] needs to be improved or the EU is subject to [[disinformation]] campaigns. Such products will be put at the disposal of the EU's political leadership, press services, EU [[delegation]]s and EU Member States and are intended for the widest possible public audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-Homepage/2116/questions-and-answers-about-east-stratcom-task-force_en|title=Questions and Answers about the East StratCom Task Force - EEAS - European External Action Service - European Commission|website=EEAS - European External Action Service|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Team is designated to develop communication campaigns, targeting key [[audience]]s and focused on specific issues of relevance to those audiences, including local issues. The actions of the East Stratcom Team are built on existing work and coherent with wider EU communication efforts, including activities of the EU institutions and EU Member States.&lt;ref name="ap" /&gt;

== Key Task Force products ==
The team's positive communications products are mainly focused on the countries of the Eastern Neighbourhood and produced in the local languages of those countries. They are distributed via social media channels of the EU Delegations in the region, and are also carried on television and via other media and public events.&lt;ref name="Q &amp; A"&gt;{{cite web|title=Questions and Answers about the East StratCom Task Force|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-Homepage/2116/questions-and-answers-about-east-stratcom-task-force_en|publisher=EEAS - European External Action Service|language=en}} Material has been copied from this source. Reuse is authorised, provided the source is acknowledged.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Task Force, in cooperation with the European Commission, led the EU's six month Eastern Partnership communications campaign culminating in the November 2017 Eastern Partnership Summit in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/36233/eastern-partnership-summit-24112017_en|title=Eastern Partnership summit, 24/11/2017 - EEAS - European External Action Service - European Commission|website=EEAS - European External Action Service|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team's main product to raise awareness of disinformation is the weekly Disinformation Review (in English and Russian languages). This can provide valuable data for analysts, journalists and officials dealing with this issue. The Disinformation Review also brings the latest news and analyses of pro-Kremlin disinformation.&lt;ref name="Q &amp; A"/&gt; Launched in November 2015, the Disinformation Review has been described as "the best weekly disinformation bulletin anywhere in the West"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|title=Lecture by Edward Lucas|date=2016-07-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx_cqNR3bJA%7Clanguage=en%7Caccessdate=2018-03-19|accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The full record of the Task Force's work on disinformation is available on its website [https://euvsdisinfo.eu/ EUvsDisinfo.eu] (in [https://euvsdisinfo.eu/news/ English], [https://euvsdisinfo.eu/ru/ Russian] and [https://euvsdisinfo.eu/de/ German] languages). The team also runs the European External Action Service's [https://eeas.europa.eu/ru/eu-information-russian_ru Russian language website]. It is also possible to follow the team on Twitter and Facebook. This communicates primarily about the EU's foreign policy by publishing information about EU activities, as well as EU statements and press releases with relevance to the Eastern Neighbourhood in particular.&lt;ref name="Q &amp; A"/&gt;

== Reception and criticism ==
EU Member State Governments have strongly supported the Task Force since its inception and provide the majority of its staff.

The European Parliament has consistently supported the Task Force and called for adequate staffing and resourcing. An EP preparatory action for 2018 – "StratCom Plus" - has allocated €1.1m for the team to focus on how to counter disinformation on the EU more systematically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/25/eu-anti-propaganda-unit-gets-1m-a-year-to-counter-russian-fake-news|title=EU anti-propaganda unit gets €1m a year to counter Russian fake news|last=Rankin|first=Jennifer|date=2017-11-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pavel Telička|Pavel Telicka]], Vice-President of the European Parliament: "I place great value in the fact that Europe has experts who address Russia's ongoing disinformation campaigns (…). The quality and the substance of their work is outstanding. Their work is valuable as it indicated the alarming nature of our European security".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telicka.eu/cs/articles/detail/647|title=Pavel Telička píše F. Mogheriniové.

Over the course of its operation, East StratCom has identified over 3,500 disinformation cases (…) These statistics highlight the global nature of the problem, and the benefit of having a body working on disinformation beyond a single country’s borders. East StratCom’s supranational view also allows it to provide valuable insights into the broader strategy and goals of pro-Kremlin disinformation operations because it can see them as a cohesive whole, rather than isolated incidents in individual countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lawfareblog.com/european-union-steps-its-fight-against-fake-news|title=The European Union Steps Up its Fight Against Fake News|date=2017-11-14|work=Lawfare|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
An article published October 2016 on Kommunikations Forum analyses the sources East StratCom use for debunking alleged disinformation. It criticizes the top three sites, Ukrainian StopFake, EU and NATO, for not being objective credible sources in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kommunikationsforum.dk/artikler/Hvad-er-EU-s-anti-propaganda-task-forces-ideologiske-fundament|title=EU tilbageviser propaganda med objektiv sandhed|last=|first=|date=26 October 2016|work=Kommunikations Forum|access-date=28 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/29394520/Analysis_of_East_StratCom_sources_for_debunking_pro-Kremlin_misinformation|title=Analysis of East StratCom sources for debunking pro-Kremlin misinformation|last=Jesper|first=Larsen|date=24 October 2016|website=Academia|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An opinion piece written by Danish commentator, Iben Thranholm, published on Russia Insider October 2015, were listed by East StratCom as pro-Kremlin disinformation. Member of the Danish Parliament, Marie Krarup, upon discovery raised the issue in January 2017, demanding Foreign Minister, Anders Samuelsen, to take action and stop ‘black listing’ of opinions, which he declined as the listing in his view was correctly labeled 'disinformation in support for Russia'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.altinget.dk/eu/artikel/udenrigsminister-dansk-debattoer-er-korrekt-opfoert-paa-propaganda-liste|title=Minister: Dansk debattør er korrekt opført på propaganda-liste|last=|first=|date=12 January 2017|website=Altinget|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response 28 commentators wrote a joint critique stressing their concern that ‘anybody with a critical view on mass immigration could end up in the black book of EU’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.b.dk/kommentarer/28-kommentatorer-udenrigsministeren-stoetter-sortlistning-af-iben-thranholm|title=28 kommentatorer: Udenrigsministeren støtter sortlistning af Iben Thranholm|last=|first=|date=16 January 2017|website=Berlingske Tidende|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published October 2016 on Folkets Avis, lists several instances, where East StratCom has labelled critique of non Western immigration to EU as pro-Kremlin disinformation, regardless that neither the media or the content has any relation to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.folkets.dk/c/russisk-propaganda-EU-islamkritik|title=EU's East Stratcom: Islamkritik er russisk propaganda|last=|first=|date=6 October 2016|website=Folkets Avis|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted by investigative journalists at Danish newspaper, Politiken, showed that East StratCom along with Western media falsely blamed separatists, not government forces, in Eastern Ukraine for initiating an offensive in the area of Avdiivka in January 2017. Sources used by East StratCom included [[Inform Napalm|InformNapalm]] which the article shows has ties to Ukrainian death list, [[Myrotvorets]] (Peacemaker) that lists people including journalists as 'traitors' for expressing certain opinions or visiting separatist controlled areas in Eastern Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://politiken.dk/udland/art5851073/EU-er-fanget-i-propaganda-krigens-t%C3%A5ger|title=EU er fanget i propaganda-krigens tåger|last=|first=|date=27 February 2017|work=Politiken|access-date=28 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18046">The United States [[Federal Trade Commission | Federal Trade Commission's]] '''fair information practice principles''' (FIPPs) are guidelines that represent widely accepted concepts concerning fair information practice in an electronic marketplace.&lt;ref name=FTCFIPPS&gt;Federal Trade Commission, [http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.shtm Fair Information Practice Principles.]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331134113/http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.shtm |date=March 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==

FTC Fair Information Practice Principles are the result of the Commission's inquiry into the way in which online entities collect and use personal information and safeguards to assure that practice is fair and provides adequate [[information privacy]] protection. The FTC has been studying online privacy issues since 1995, and in its 1998 report,&lt;ref&gt;Federal Trade Commission, ''[https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/privacy-online-report-congress/priv-23a.pdf Privacy Online: A Report to Congress]'' (June 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; the Commission described the widely accepted Fair Information Practice Principles of ''Notice, Choice, Access, and Security''.&lt;ref name=FTCFIPPS/&gt; The Commission also identified ''Enforcement'', the use of a reliable mechanism to provide sanctions for noncompliance as a critical component of any governmental or self-regulatory program to protect online privacy.&lt;ref name=FTCFIPPS/&gt;

== History and development ==

Fair Information Practice was initially proposed and named&lt;ref&gt;US Secretary's Advisory Committee on Automated Personal Data Systems, ''[http://aspe.hhs.gov/DATACNCL/1973privacy/c4.htm Records, Computers and the Rights of Citizens]'', Chapter IV: Recommended Safeguards for Administrative Personal Data Systems (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; by the ''US Secretary's Advisory Committee on Automated Personal Data Systems'' in a 1973 report, ''Records, Computers and the Rights of Citizens'',&lt;ref&gt;US Secretary's Advisory Committee on Automated Personal Data Systems, ''[http://aspe.hhs.gov/DATACNCL/1973privacy/tocprefacemembers.htm Records, Computers and the Rights of Citizens]'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; issued in response to the growing use of automated data systems containing information about individuals. The central contribution of the Advisory Committee was the development of a code of fair information practice for automated personal data systems. 
The Privacy Protection Study Commission also may have contributed to the development of FIPs principles in its 1977 report, ''Personal Privacy in an Information Society''.&lt;ref&gt;Privacy Protection Study Commission, ''[http://epic.org/privacy/ppsc1977report/ Personal Privacy in an Information Society]'' (July 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

As privacy laws spread to other countries in Europe, international institutions took up privacy with a focus on the international implications of privacy regulation. In 1980, the [[Council of Europe]] adopted a [[Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data|Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data]].&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe,''[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/HTML/108.htm Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data]'' (Jan. 28, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)]] proposed similar privacy guidelines in the OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data.&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), ''[http://www.oecd.org/document/18/0,3343,en_2649_34255_1815186_1_1_1_1,00.html OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data]'' (Sep. 23, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;  The OECD Guidelines, [[Council of Europe]] Convention, and [[European Union]] [[Data Protection Directive]]&lt;ref&gt;European Union Data Protection Directive, Directive 95/46/EC http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/published/proceedings/R0812009.htm&lt;/ref&gt; relied on FIPs as core principles. All three organizations revised and extended the original U.S. statement of FIPs, with the OECD Privacy Guidelines being the version most often cited in subsequent years.&lt;ref name=gellman&gt;Robert Gellman, ''[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2950752 Fair Information Practices: A Basic History]'' (Apr. 10, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles==
The core principles of privacy addressed by these principles are:

'''1. Notice/Awareness&lt;ref name=FIPNotice&gt;Federal Trade Commission, [http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.shtm#Notice/Awareness Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPs), 1. Notice/Awareness.]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309105100/http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.shtm#Notice/Awareness |date=March 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;''' 
Consumers should be given notice of an entity's information practices before any personal information is collected from them.&lt;ref name=FIPNotice/&gt; This requires that companies explicitly notify some or all of the following:
*identification of the entity collecting the data; 
*identification of the uses to which the data will be put; 
*identification of any potential recipients of the data; 
*the nature of the data collected and the means by which it is collected; 
*whether the provision of the requested data is voluntary or required; 
*the steps taken by the data collector to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and quality of the data.&lt;ref name=FIPNotice/&gt;

'''2. Choice/Consent&lt;ref name=FIPConsent&gt;Federal Trade Commission, [http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.shtm#Choice/Consent Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPs), 2. Choice/Consent.]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309105100/http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.shtm#Choice/Consent |date=March 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;'''
Choice and consent in an on-line information-gathering sense means giving consumers options to control how their data is used. Specifically, choice relates to secondary uses of information beyond the immediate needs of the information collector to complete the consumer's transaction. The two typical types of choice models are 'opt-in' or 'opt-out.' The 'opt-in' method requires that consumers affirmatively give permission for their information to be used for other purposes. Without the consumer taking these affirmative steps in an 'opt-in' system, the information gatherer assumes that it cannot use the information for any other purpose.  The 'opt-out' method requires consumers to affirmatively decline permission for other uses. Without the consumer taking these affirmative steps in an 'opt-out' system, the information gatherer assumes that it ''can'' use the consumer's information for other purposes. Each of these systems can be designed to allow an individual consumer to tailor the information gatherer's use of the information to fit their preferences by checking boxes to grant or deny permission for specific purposes rather than using a simple "all or nothing" method.&lt;ref name=FIPConsent/&gt;

'''2-1. Problems with Choice/Consent &lt;ref name=jhhwang7&gt;Tavani, H.T. &amp; Bottis M. (2010, June). The consent process in medical research involving DNA databanks: some ethical implications and challenges. ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society, 40(2), 11-21. {{doi|10.1145/1839994.1839996}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''
Consumers do not have a fair say in the consent process. For example, customers provide their health information such as their social insurance number or health card number while making on-line an appointment for a dental check-up. Customers are commonly asked to sign an agreement stating that a ‘third-party may have an access to the information you provide under certain conditions.’ The certain conditions are rarely specified in any part of the agreement. Later on, the third-party may share the information with their subsidiary institutions. Thus, access to customers’ personal information is beyond their control.&lt;ref name=jhhwang7/&gt;

'''3. Access/Participation&lt;ref name=FIPAccess&gt;Federal Trade Commission, [http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.shtm#Access/Participation Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPs), 3. Access/Participation.]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309105100/http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.shtm#Access/Participation |date=March 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;'''
Access as defined in the Fair Information Practice Principles includes not only a consumer's ability to view the data collected, but also to verify and contest its accuracy. This access must be inexpensive and timely in order to be useful to the consumer.&lt;ref name=FIPAccess/&gt;

'''4. Integrity/Security&lt;ref name=FIPSecurity&gt;Federal Trade Commission, [http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.shtm#Integrity/Security Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPs), 4. Integrity/Security.]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309105100/http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.shtm#Integrity/Security |date=March 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;'''
Information collectors should ensure that the data they collect is accurate and secure. They can improve the integrity of data by cross-referencing it with only reputable databases and by providing access for the consumer to verify it. Information collectors can keep their data secure by protecting against both internal and external security threats. They can limit access within their company to only necessary employees to protect against internal threats, and they can use encryption and other computer-based security systems to stop outside threats.&lt;ref name=FIPSecurity/&gt;

'''5. Enforcement/Redress&lt;ref name=FIPEnforcement&gt;Federal Trade Commission, [http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.shtm#Enforcement/Redress Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPs), 5. Enforcement/Redress.]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309105100/http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.shtm#Enforcement/Redress |date=March 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;'''
In order to ensure that companies follow the Fair Information Practice Principles, there must be enforcement measures. The FTC identified three types of enforcement measures: self-regulation by the information collectors or an appointed regulatory body; private remedies that give civil causes of action for individuals whose information has been misused to sue violators; and government enforcement that can include civil and criminal penalties levied by the government.&lt;ref name=FIPEnforcement/&gt;

== Enforcing the principles==

Currently the FTC version of the Fair Information Principles are only recommendations for maintaining privacy-friendly,  consumer-oriented data collection practices, and are not enforceable by law.  The enforcement of and adherence to these principles is principally performed through self-regulation. The FTC has, however, undertaken efforts to evaluate industry self-regulation practices,&lt;ref name =industryguidelines&gt;FTC Industry Association Guidelines http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/industry.shtm#Industry%20Association%20Guidelines%20A&lt;/ref&gt; provides guidance for industry in developing information practices,&lt;ref name=infopractices&gt;Protecting Personal Information: A Guide for Business http://www.ftc.gov/infosecurity/&lt;/ref&gt; and uses its authority under the FTC Act to enforce promises made by corporations in their privacy policies.&lt;ref name=title5privacy&gt;Enforcing Privacy Promises: Section 5 of the FTC Act http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/promises.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Since self-regulatory initiatives fall short of ideal implementation of the principles (the 2000 FTC Report noted, for example, that self-regulatory initiatives lacked meaningful monitoring and enforcement policies and practices),  the Commission  recommends that the [[United States Congress]] enact legislation that, in conjunction with continuing self-regulatory programs, will ensure adequate protection of consumer privacy online.&lt;ref name=2000report&gt;FTC 2000 Privacy Report http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy2000/privacy2000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  "The legislation recommended by the Commission would set forth a basic level of privacy protection for consumer-oriented commercial Web sites" and "would establish basic standards of practice for the collection of information online...consumer-oriented commercial Web sites that collect personal identifying information from or about consumers online... would be required to comply with the four widely-accepted fair information practices."&lt;ref name=gellman&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles, however, form the basis of many individual laws at the both federal and state levels—called the "sectoral approach." Examples are the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]], the [[Right to Financial Privacy Act]], the [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]], the [[Video Privacy Protection Act]] (VPPA), and the [[Cable Television Protection and Competition Act]].&lt;ref name=DHS&gt;Department of Homeland Security, Privacy Policy Guidance Memorandum (2008) (Memorandum Number 2008-1), https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/privacy/privacy_policyguide_2008-01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the principles continue to serve as a model for privacy protections in newly developing areas, such as in designing Smart Grid programs.&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation and Center for Democracy and Technology Joint Filing with the California Public Utilities Commission regarding California's Smart Grid Program. http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/EFILE/CM/114696.pdf; https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/03/new-smart-meters-energy-use-put-privacy-risk&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other proposals regarding 'fair information'==

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[European Union]], among others, have adopted more comprehensive approaches to fair information practices. The OECD principles provide added protections via the ''Individual Participation principle'' where specific requirements are made for access and modification of personally collected information by the individual and the ''Accountability principle'' (a data controller should be accountable for complying with measures which give effect to the principles stated above).&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data (Sep. 23, 1980).http://www.oecd.org/document/18/0,3343,en_2649_34255_1815186_1_1_1_1,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pam Dixon, ''[http://www.worldprivacyforum.org/fairinformationpractices.html A Brief Introduction to Fair Information Practices]'' World Privacy Forum (June 5, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] [[Data Protection Directive]] is another model for comprehensive privacy protections.&lt;ref name=datadirective&gt;Directive 95/46/EC http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:EN:HTML&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Spiros Simitis]], From the Market to the Polis: The EU Directive on the Protection of Personal Data, 80 Iowa L. Rev. 445 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the FTC principles==

The FIPPs are criticized by some scholars for being less comprehensive in scope than privacy regimes in other countries, in particular in the European Union and other OECD countries. Additionally, the FTC's formulation of the principles has been criticized in comparison to those issued by other agencies.  The [https://web.archive.org/web/20090205180646/http://ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.shtm FTC's 2000 version of FIPs]  is shorter and less complete than the privacy protection principles issued by the Privacy Office of the [[Department of Homeland Security]] in 2008, which include eight principles closely aligned with the OECD principles.&lt;ref name=DHS/&gt;

Some in the privacy community criticize the FIPPs for being too weak, allowing too many exemptions, failing to require a privacy agency, failing to account for the weaknesses of self-regulation, and not keeping pace with information technology.  {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} Many privacy experts have called for omnibus privacy protection legislation in the US&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. Schwartz, Privacy and Democracy in Cyberspace, 52 Vand. L. Rev. 1609 (1999); Joel R. Reidenberg, Restoring Americans' Privacy in Electronic Commerce, 14 Berkeley Tech. L. J. 771 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; in lieu of the current blend of self-regulation and selective codification in certain sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Examples are the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]], the [[Right to Financial Privacy Act]], the [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act]], and the [[Video Privacy Protection Act]]. Beth Givens, ''[http://www.privacyrights.org/ar/fairinfo.htm A Review of the Fair Information Principles : The Foundation of Privacy Public Policy]'' (posted 1997, updated 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics from a business perspective often prefer to limit FIPs to reduced elements of notice, consent, and accountability. They complain that other elements are unworkable, expensive, or inconsistent with openness or free speech principles.&lt;ref name=gellman&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|1632 series|The Grantville Gazettes}}

'''''Grantville Gazette II''''' is the third collaborative anthology published in print set in the [[1632-verse]] [[shared universe]] in what is best regarded as a canonical sub-series of the popular [[alternate history]] that began with the February 2000 publication of the hardcover novel [[1632 (novel)|1632]] by author-historian [[Eric Flint]]. Baen Books and Flint decline the distinction, counting this book as the sixth published work. Overall it is also the third anthology in printed publication in the atypical series which consists of a mish-mash of main novels and anthologies produced under popular demand after publication of the initial novel which was written as a stand-alone work.

Schultheiss continued to condemn Grantville's practices until his outcries infuriated his wife, who has a positive view on Grantville. Eventually, with guidance from his wife, Schultheiss changed his stance on Grantville and becomes more tolerated on the Americans' ideals, including [[freedom of religion]].

==="An Invisible War"===
:by Danita Ewing

"An Invisible War" is a short novel that was the first serialized piece of longer fiction that spanned this and the next Gazette in their e-published versions—though the whole (110 pages) was published in the hardcover release of ''Grantville Gazette II''. The tale set mostly in 1633 after Grantville has had time to settle-in and look beyond immediate survival issues. It deals with public health and integration and dissemination of medical knowledge efforts during the end of the Confederated Principalities of Europe and early United States of Europe period, for the various Mike Stearns-led administration's have been repeatedly reminded by {{nowrap|[[List of 1632 fictional characters#Nichols, James|Dr. James Nichols]]}} and [[List of 1632 fictional characters#Mailey, Melissa|Melissa Mailey]] how vulnerable populations are and were to diseases in the seventeenth century era—so the up-timers have been both strategically aware and taking steps from the outset within their capabilities and resources to mitigate any preventable health problems beginning in the novel [[1632 (novel)|1632]]. To add impetus and urgency, as time goes by in the experience of Grantville, some of the historical research conducted in the two libraries reveals that plague outbreaks occurred locally in OTL in diverse regions during 1632, 1634, and 1635 saw a large epidemic-size outbreak. Worse, the historical record might also indicate other outbreaks, which were poorly documented.

The story is one of Grantville's medical personnel meeting head-on with down-timer University practices, prejudices and a college curricula based in large part on the [[Classics]] and [[theology|Theological]] studies. The town establishes the Lahey Clinic hospital near the Grantville High School and establishes a local nurse training program in 1631–1632, and by the summer of 1633 has reached out to the faculty of the University of Jena, but the only spareable medical manpower to head up a college of medicine are... women!

'''Hans Hermann Adler''' (7 April 1891 – 29 March 1956) was a German professor of [[journalism]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]].

==Life==
Adler was a graduate of the Humanist High School Eger in West [[Bohemia]]. After completing his studies of classical [[philology]] and history at the [[Charles University in Prague]], [[University of Innsbruck]] and [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], he received his Ph.D. from the [[University of Graz]]. He became a trainee at the {{ill|Johann Conrad Hinrichs|de|Johann Conrad Hinrichs|lt=J. C. Hinrichs}} bookstore in [[Leipzig]], a journalist and theater critic, and was editor of the [[Schlesische Zeitung]] in [[Breslau]] and the Oderzeitung in [[Frankfurt (Oder)]]{{as written|reason=This is not [[WP:PARENDIS]] this is the current official name of the city.}}. In 1932, he became a professor of journalism at [[Heidelberg University]], endowed by the {{ill| Verein Deutscher Zeitungsverleger|de|Verein Deutscher Zeitungsverleger}} (Association of German Newspaper Publishers). In 1933, after the dismissal of [[Hans von Eckardt]], he took over the director of the Institut für Zeitungswissenschaften (Institute for the Study of Journalism) as honorary professor, and received the privilege of "right to examine" (''Prüfungsrecht''){{efn|In German law, the ''{{ill|Prüfungsrecht|de|Prüfungsrecht (Deutschland)}}'' defines who has the right to examine candidates for professional certification or advanced degrees, and what rules they operate under.}}  in the faculties of philosophy, political science, and economics at the University of Heidelberg. He became Director of its Interpreting Institute, and from 1941-45 had regular teaching duties as professor. During this time, he was a member of the editorial board of the "Handbuch für Zeitungswissenschaften" (Handbook for the Study of Journalism) and also authored some of its articles. Adler was a contributor to [[Hans Joachim Beyer]]'s Nazi periodical ''Auslandsdeutsche Volksforschung''.

Adler spent the last years of his life in Wallerstein in the [[Nördlinger Ries]] in [[Bavaria]] and promoted the {{ill|Egerländer Gmoi|de}}, an association of people from the [[Egerland]] region.

==Ancestry==
The origin of the Adler family was in the old bourgeoisie of the Egerland, which since 1392 had held its ministerial seat at Treunitz at Eger (now Dřenice, Cheb). The Egerländer Adlers are probably descendants of the old Bohemian nobility of Adlar from the family of Janovice, which was named after the town of [[Janovice nad Úhlavou|Janowitz an der Angel]] (Janovice nad Úhlavou), which ultimately takes its name from a man named Johannes.&lt;ref&gt;This is documented in 1224, in the ''Codex diplomaticus et epistolaris regni Bohemiae''&lt;/ref&gt; The Janovice and their descendants were historically important, and had a coat of arms featuring an eagle with a horizontal half-moon with clover leaf tips.&lt;ref&gt;See Roman von Procházka, ''Genealogisches Handbuch erloschener böhmischer Herrenstandsfamilien.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Heinz Awards''' are individual achievement honors given annually by the [[Heinz Foundations|Heinz Family Foundation]]. The Heinz Awards each year recognize outstanding individuals for their innovative contributions in five areas: Arts and Humanities; Environment; Human Condition; Public Policy; and Technology, the Economy and Employment. The award was established in 1993 by [[Teresa Heinz]], the [[chairwoman]] of the [[Heinz Foundations|Heinz Family Foundation]],&lt;ref name=usatoday /&gt; in honor of her late husband, Senator [[H. John Heinz III]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Heinz Awards :: The Awards |publisher = [[Heinz Foundations|Heinz Family Foundation]] |url = http://www.heinzawards.net/awards|accessdate = June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nasa /&gt;&lt;ref name=dressel /&gt;&lt;ref name=holder /&gt;&lt;ref name=apa /&gt; The Heinz Award is considered to be among the largest individual achievement prizes in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Herr Wins Heinz Award for Helping Physically Challenged |publisher = [[MIT]] School of Architecture |date = September 12, 2007 |url = http://sap.mit.edu/resources/portfolio/heinz_award/|accessdate = June 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mnt /&gt;

==Selection process==

===Criteria===
As written by the [[Heinz Foundations|Heinz Family Foundation]], the candidates who are chosen must meet three standards:

First, nominees must exhibit the following personal characteristics: A passion for excellence that goes beyond intellectual curiosity; a concern for humanity rooted in a deep sensitivity for the well-being of others; and a broad vision which extends far beyond the particular and embraces something universal.

Second, work of the candidates for a Heinz Award must meet the following criteria: Be significant and not a "quick fix"; Have an enduring and meaningful impact; be creative and innovative; and be sufficiently tangible to serve as a model for replication elsewhere.

Third, candidates should be actively working in the field in which they are nominated so that this award will enhance their potential for future societal contribution.&lt;ref name=criteria&gt;{{cite web|title = The Heinz Awards :: criteria + selection process |publisher = [[Heinz Foundations|Heinz Family Foundation]] |url = http://www.heinzawards.net/awards/criteria|accessdate = March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selection===
Members of an [[Anonymity|anonymous]] Council of Nominators are chosen for their expertise in the fields relevant to the award for which they will be nominating.&lt;ref name=mnt /&gt; After the nominators have chosen the candidates, the nominations are forwarded to a jury consisting of noted experts in each of the five categories. The jury then chooses the final recipients and sends these to the program’s Board for final approval.&lt;ref name=criteria2&gt;{{cite web |title = The Heinz Awards :: The Awards |publisher = [[Heinz Foundations|Heinz Family Foundation]] |url = http://www.heinzawards.net/awards|accessdate = March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Chairman's Medal==
In certain years, the Heinz Awards Board has also chosen to honor the lifetime achievement of a particular individual. The award is a non-monetary prize, and the honoree is presented with the Awards' medallion at the same ceremony as the other [[laureates]].

==Special Focus on the Environment==
In 2009, in honor of the awards' 15th anniversary, an award for special focus on the [[Environmentalism|environment]] was created in lieu of the traditional five awards. A larger group of 10 individuals were awarded {{dollarsign|USD|lk=on}}100,000 each, honoring those working in innovative ways to address the environment through the lens of the existing five categories.&lt;ref name="15th"&gt;{{cite web|title = The Heinz Awards :: 15th special focus |publisher = [[Heinz Foundations|Heinz Family Foundation]] |url = http://www.heinzawards.net/categories/15th-special-focus|accessdate = December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ksmith /&gt;

Similarly, in 2010 and 2011 the Special Focus was continued, and in both years 10 individuals were again each awarded {{dollarsign|USD|lk=on}}100,000 each.&lt;ref name= sandranancy /&gt; In 2012, the Awards returned to the core five categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = The Heinz Awards :: 16th Global Change |publisher = [[Heinz Foundations|Heinz Family Foundation]] |url = http://www.heinzawards.net/categories/16th-global-change|accessdate = December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11533">&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python).jpg|thumb|"Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!"]] --&gt;
The [[Catholic Church]] has been a subject for humor, from the time of the Reformation to the present day. Such humor ranges from mild burlesque to derisive attacks. Catholic clergy and lay organizations such as the [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] monitor for particularly offensive and derogatory incidents and voice their objections and protests.

Examples of fairly mild burlesque of the Church in the twentieth century include material by humourists such as the Irish comedian [[Dave Allen (comedian)|Dave Allen]] and the comedy show'' [[Father Ted]].''

==Television==

===Monty Python===
Traditional fears about the Roman Catholic Church were burlesqued by [[Monty Python]] in their [[The Spanish Inquisition (Monty Python)|Spanish Inquisition sketch]] (first aired September 22, 1970) in which hapless victims of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] are threatened with the 'comfy chair' and other such innocuous implements of torture.

Another sketch by Monty Python featured a song "[[Every Sperm Is Sacred]]" (1983) which is a satire of Catholic teachings on reproduction which forbid masturbation and contraception by artificial means. The sketch is about a Catholic Dad (played by Michael Palin), his wife (Mum, played by Terry Jones) and their 63 children, who are about to be sold for medical experimentation purposes because their parents can no longer afford to care for such a large family. When their children ask why they don't use contraception or sterilization, Dad explains that this is against God's wishes, and breaks into the song "Every Sperm is Sacred". The real punchline comes a bit later, as a scoffing Protestant Husband (played by Graham Chapman), after observing the large family's song and dance, briefly describes this "typical catholic" situation to his wife (Eric Idle). He goes on to remark how, as a Protestant, he could down to the store and unashamedly buy a condom, and that way, "because I'm a Protestant", intercourse is not bound to pregnancy, and therefore, available to them any time they wish. Protestant Wife's quietly excited reaction reveals, however, that they've never availed themselves of this option, turning the joke back round on the scoffing Protestants.

===Dave Allen===
Irishman [[Dave Allen (comedian)|Dave Allen]] (1936–2005) was the host of several comedy series broadcast on UK TV from the 1960s to the 1990s. The most controversial was called ''Dave Allen at Large'', which broadcast 1971–79 on UK TV. The programmes consisted of an introductory standup routine by Allen leading to handsomely mounted sketches that continued on the themes touched on in the opening monologue. The comedian's trademark debunking of religious, especially Catholic, ritual throughout each episode made for minor controversy which, coupled with some quite frank material, earned the show a somewhat risqué reputation. His later comedy series continued in the same vein and included sketches showing the Pope (played by Allen) and his Cardinals doing a striptease on the steps of St Peter's; aggressive priests beating up their parishioners and other priests; priests who spoke like [[Daleks]] though electronic confessionals; and an extremely excitable Pope who spoke in a [[Chico Marx]] type accent as he ordered Allen to "getta your bum outta Rome!"&lt;ref&gt;''The Essential Dave Allen'' (2005) edited by Graham McCann. Hodder and Stoughton: London.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Father Ted===
The ''[[Father Ted]]'' series, broadcast on UK television 1993–98, follows the exploits of three [[Roman Catholic]] [[priest]]s who preside over a parish on [[Craggy Island]] off the Irish coast.  The reasons for their exile, which are hinted at across several episodes, appear to stem from a mixture of incompetence and embarrassing conduct: [[Father Dougal McGuire]] due to his stupidity and incompetence (with particular regard to the "Blackrock Incident", which is never further elaborated on, although Bishop Brennan mentions "the strings I had to pull to stop the Vatican getting involved"); [[Father Jack Hackett|Father Jack]] because of his alcoholism and implied womanising, which caused severe embarrassment to the [[Catholic Church]] (a "wedding in [[Athlone]]" is mentioned); and [[Father Ted Crilly]] for alleged financial impropriety. Ted insists he was innocent, regularly claiming that "the money was just resting in my account", and that it was "a perfectly legitimate monetary transfer". The senile Father Jack is notorious for the economy of expression and intent revealed in his catchphrase "Drink! Feck! Arse! Girls!" Their superior [[List of Father Ted characters#Bishop Brennan|Bishop Brennan]] also has skeletons in his closet. In one episode it is revealed that he has a mistress and a son. This satirical shaft seems to refer to the real-life scandal surrounding [[Eamon Casey]], former Bishop of Galway, whose domestic circumstances were similar to Bishop Brennan's.

===South Park===
[[Catholic League (U.S.)|The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights]] condemned the [[Bloody Mary (South Park)|Bloody Mary]] episode of [[South Park]] for its treatment of the Virgin Mary. They demanded an apology to Roman Catholics and that the episode "be permanently retired and not be made available on DVD." In particular, they also demanded that [[Joseph A. Califano, Jr.]], a member of [[Viacom]]'s (the parent of [[Comedy Central]]) board of directors and a practicing Catholic, issue his own statement of condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite press release|title=Virgin Mary defiled on "South Park" |publisher=Catholic League (U.S.) |date=2005-12-08 |url=http://www.catholicleague.org/05press_releases/quarter%204/051208_south_park.htm |accessdate=2006-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718164613/http://www.catholicleague.org/05press_releases/quarter%204/051208_south_park.htm |archivedate=2007-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Califano did later release a statement calling the episode an "appalling and disgusting portrayal of the Virgin Mary", and pledged to have it reviewed by Viacom's president and CEO, [[Tom Freston]]. Bishop [[William Skylstad]], president of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], sent a letter to Freston saying the network showed "extreme insensitivity" when it aired the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cathnews.com/news/512/119.php|title=Bishops' president blasts ''South Park'' episode|date=2005-12-21|publisher=Church Resources|accessdate=2006-07-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224040116/http://www.cathnews.com/news/512/119.php |archivedate=2005-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Comedy Central re-aired all the episodes from South Park's Fall 2005 season on December 28, 2005, "Bloody Mary" was noticeably absent from the broadcast. Comedy Central responded to e-mail inquiries about the fate of the episode with the assurance that "Bloody Mary" has not been retired and would not be pulled from the DVD release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/09/south_park_bloody_ma.html |title=South Park "Bloody Mary" an immaculate deletion, says Comedy Central |date=2006-01-09 |publisher=BoingBoing |accessdate=2006-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426221954/http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/09/south_park_bloody_ma.html |archivedate=2006-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, screen captures from the episode are still missing on Comedy Central's press site and the South Park section of comedycentral.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,18055,00.html?tnews |title="South Park" Parked by Complaints? |date=2005-12-29 |author=Sarah Hall |publisher=[[E!]] |accessdate=2006-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427031803/http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0%2C1%2C18055%2C00.html?tnews |archivedate=2006-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006 interview with ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'', South Park co-creator [[Matt Stone]] said when asked if he felt more sympathy (if any) for Catholics (for ''Bloody Mary'') or [[Scientologists]] (for the episode [[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]], another Season 9 episode regarding religion that had been temporarily pulled from re-runs for insensitivity), he said his sympathy lay with the Catholics{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}.

==Film==

===Buñuel===
[[Luis Buñuel]] who was a fierce critic of the perceived pretension and hypocrisy of the Roman Catholic Church. Many of his most famous films demonstrate this:

:''[[Un chien andalou]]'' (1929): A man drags pianos, upon which are piled several priests, among other things.
:''[[L'Âge d'Or]]'' (1930): A bishop is thrown out a window, and in the final scene one of the culprits of the ''[[120 days of Sodom]]'' by [[Marquis de Sade]] is portrayed by an actor dressed in a way that he would be recognized as Jesus.
:''[[Ensayo de un crimen]]'' (1955): A man dreams of murdering his wife while she's praying in bed dressed all in white.
:''[[Simon of the Desert]]'' (1965): The devil tempts the saint by taking the form of a naughty, bare-breasted little girl singing and showing off her legs. At the end of the film, the saint abandons his ascetic life to hang out in a jazz club.
:''[[Nazarin]]'' (1959): The pious lead character wreaks ruin through his attempts at charity.
:''[[Viridiana]]'' (1961): A well-meaning young nun tries unsuccessfully to help the poor.
:''[[The Milky Way (1969 film)|The Milky Way]]'' (1969): Two men travel the ancient pilgrimage road to [[Santiago de Compostela]] and meet embodiments of various heresies along the way. One dreams of anarchists shooting the Pope.

===Robbie Coltrane===
[[Robbie Coltrane]] portrays a naive priest who is made Pope in a corrupt mafia-controlled Vatican in the comedy film ''[[The Pope Must Die]]'' (1991). The plot alludes to the [[Roberto Calvi]] scandal and the [[Pope John Paul I conspiracy theories]]. Coltrane had previously donned clerical vestments in ''[[Nuns on the Run]]'' (1990).  Earlier in his career Coltrane had also created a television comedy character known as 'Mason Boyne' - a spoof Scottish Presbyterian [[Orange Order|Orangeman]] - who was rabidly anti-Catholic to the point of painting over the leaves on plants with orange paint.

==Other==

===Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Early Sisters.gif|right|thumb|150px|Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence]] --&gt;
The [[Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence]], an international group of mostly gay men who frequently mock Catholicism and promote [[safe sex]] and [[AIDS]] awareness, hold anniversary parties and parades on [[Easter Sunday]]. Their use of Catholic symbolism is considered offensive by some.

The '''Institute of Aesthetic Research''' ('''Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas''') of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], since its foundation in 1936, research has been carried out in its installations into the [[Mexican art|different forms of artistic expression in Mexico]]; the diversity of studies undertaken by the body of researchers in the fields of criticism, theory and history of art across a horizon that reaches other latitudes. It has thus become a space in which the plastic arts converge with dance, literature, photography, cinema and music.

Every year, through its International Colloquium on Art History, the Institute opens its doors to academic reflection on the history of art. Since 1975, this space has been a meeting point for the voices of both Mexican and foreign researchers.

To perform its tasks of study and dissemination, both of Mexican art and that of other countries, the Institute harbors a number of different areas, each of which has its particular sphere of interest:
*The Manuel Toussaint Photographic Archive conserves the collections of images which serve as a support for academic activities. With over 750,000 images, the Archive grown to be the country’s most important depositary of visual documents related to Mexican art; it also has a specialized conservation laboratory. The tasks carried out in the Archive range from the lending of materials for consultation to the organization of photographic exhibitions for museums in Mexico and abroad.
*The collection of the Justino Fernández Library is the most important and extensive in Latin America as regards material devoted to the study of art. It provides an invaluable support for research through its programs of donations and exchanges of books and interlibrary interchange and loans; it also participates, by means of its book and periodical collections, in different exhibitions and in the production of television programs.
*The Documentary Investigation Department carries out research activities in different archives in Mexico. Its labors are concentrated in the Catalogues of art documents. These tools help to orient the Institute’s investigations and represent a significant labor of collaboration in its output.
*The Laboratory for Diagnosis of Works of Art participates in projects aimed at researching and conserving the national artistic heritage, by means of the analysis of materials and procedures used in the creation of works of art.
*In December, 2007, the Hypermedia Laboratory commenced its activities. In it are concentrated the Institute community’s interests in exploiting the possibilities of digital technology for the study, investigation and dissemination of art history.
*The most important medium for disseminating the Institute’s research are printed books. Every title published by the Publications Department is an endorsement of the Institute’s commitment to maintaining the exceptional quality that has been attained by its printed media. In this effort it is accompanied by the journal Anales del Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas, which, twice-yearly, offers in its pages the work of prestigious researchers from all over the world.

The distribution of the Institute’s publications is not limited to the UNAM’s system of libraries, but extends to other sales outlets. The electronic shop, still under construction, is also oriented towards the same /will also make a contribution to this effort, bringing the Institute’s work to a broader public.

The journal Imágenes is an electronic publication which offers various articles publicizing the Institute’s academic activities and other news items to do with the history of art. Its contents and characteristics have made it the most visited section of the Institute’s electronic portal.

In August, 2007, work started at the new branch headquarters of the Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas in the City of Oaxaca, which are lodged in an old domestic building in the Alameda de León, which dates from the eighteenth century and was received by the UNAM in commodatum in 2005.

This branch is home to a library—comprising over six thousand volumes—which belonged to Dr. Beatriz de la Fuente, among which are some facsimiles of [[pre-Hispanic codices]]. The library is endowed with the necessary features for operating as a videoconference room. The equipment installed is similar to that in the Francisco de la Maza room in the Institute’s headquarters on the University campus in Mexico City, thus facilitating constant communication between both. It is to be hoped that this study center will become a point of reference for the south of the country and for the whole of Central America.

'''Jagoda Buić''' (born 14 March 1930) is an acclaimed [[Croatia]]n visual artist best known for her monumental [[fiber art]] installations and tapestries.

Born in the coastal city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]], Buić studied at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, University of Zagreb|Zagreb Academy of Fine Arts]] and Art History at the [[University of Zagreb]] before graduating in [[interior architecture]] and [[scenography]], textiles and [[costume design]] at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="hrenc"/&gt; After graduation she went on to study film set design at the [[Cinecittà]] studio in [[Rome]] and the history of costume design at the International Centre for Arts and Costume housed at [[Palazzo Grassi]] in [[Venice]].&lt;ref name="ulupuhbio"/&gt;

She went on to work on more than 120 projects as a costume and stage designer in various opera, ballet, theatre and film productions at various theatres in Vienna, Zagreb, Osijek, Dubrovnik and Split.&lt;ref name="hrenc"/&gt; In 1965, at the Lausanne Biennial of Textile Art, Buić impressed contemporary art critics with her first textile installation which was immediately bought by the [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="ulupuhbio"&gt;{{cite web|title=ULUPUH - Jagoda Buić|url=http://www.ulupuh.hr/hr/straniceclanova.asp?idsekcije=13&amp;idclana=596|language=Croatian|publisher=Croatian Association of Artists of Applied Arts (ULUPUH)|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to exhibit her monumental textile works at art shows and contemporary art museums around the world, becoming known for vast installations made out of textile cords, hemp and wool, and experiments with unusual surface textures and space. Since the 1970s, Buić, together with Polish artist [[Magdalena Abakanowicz]], is credited with pioneering innovative textile forms in contemporary arts.

In the 1980s she started using metals in her sculptures and installations, and in the 2000s she turned to using collages of assorted materials, including paper, cardboard, wool, etc.&lt;ref name="hrenc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Buić, Jagoda|url=http://enciklopedija.hr/Natuknica.aspx?ID=10043|website=Croatian Encyclopedia|publisher=LZMK|language=Croatian|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Period ==
Structures belonging to Early Harappan and Mature Harappan period were found in this site. A different type of pottery  found in this place as well as  at Somnath (Prabhas Patan), Lotershwar indicate an indigeneious tradition distinct from that of Amri-Nal, known from earlier occupations at Padri and Loteshwar (McIntosh, Jane).{{sfn|McIntosh|2008|p=74-221}}

==Findings==
Copper fish hooks, of exceptionally big size are found here, indicating large fish were caught. Well made, sturdy storage jars were also found at this site, which were used for transporting salt. A jar found at this place is decorated with buffalo horn motif and with a large figure in a ragged skirt and wearing a pair of buffalo horns.{{sfn|McIntosh|2008|p=135-137}} In early Harappan levels of this site, symbols similar to Harappan writing were found and such writings were also found at [[Kalibangan]] and [[Dholavira]].&lt;ref name=singh&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Upinder|title=A history of ancient and early medieval India : from the Stone Age to the 12th century|year=2008|publisher=Pearson Education|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788131711200|pages=146|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;dq=upinder+singh&amp;q=padri#v=snippet&amp;q=padri&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Portrait of Mauma Mollie - WDL.png|thumbnail|Mauma Mollie. She died in the 1850s at the home of the white Florida family she served. A family member described her as nursing "nearly all of the children in the family," and said that they loved her as a "second mother."&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4014/|title=Portrait of Mauma Mollie|website=[[World Digital Library]]|date=1850|accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''mammy''', also spelled '''mammie''',&lt;ref&gt;Denise DeCaires Narain, ''Contemporary Caribbean Women's Poetry: Making Style'', p. 87: "''[...] the continued commodification of the black woman as 'mammie' figure.''"&lt;/ref&gt; is a U.S. [[stereotype]], especially in the [[Southern United States|South]], for a black woman who worked in a white family and nursed the family's children.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster Dictionary"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mammy Merriam-Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One of the earliest fictionalized versions of the mammy figure is Aunt Chloe in [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', which was first published in 1852.&lt;ref name="Mythification of the Mammy Figure"&gt;[http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA99/diller/mammy/fiction.html Mythification of the Mammy Figure]&lt;/ref&gt; As the mammy figure progressed into the 20th century, the [[persona]] was sacrificed to the demands of the white majority, who widely mythologized the figure. Memoirs that describe the roles of mammies from the 1890s to the 1920s downplayed the mammy's relationship with her family.&lt;ref name="Mythification of the Mammy Figure"/&gt;

The background of the mammy figure was the history of [[slavery in the United States]]. [[African-American]] female slaves were tasked with the duties of [[domestic worker]]s in [[White American]] households. Their duties included preparing meals, cleaning homes, and nursing and rearing their owners' children. Out of these circumstances arose the image of the mammy.&lt;ref name="Walker-Barnes"&gt;Walker-Barnes (2014), p. 85-88&lt;/ref&gt;

While originating in the slavery period, the mammy figure rose to prominence during the [[Reconstruction Era]]. In the [[Southern United States]], the mammy played a role in [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]] efforts to reinterpret and legitimize their legacy of [[Slavery#Chattel slavery|chattel slavery]] and racial oppression. The mammy image endured there to the 20th century. In 1923, the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] proposed the erection of a mammy statue on the [[National Mall]]. The proposed statue would be dedicated to "The Black Mammy of the South".&lt;ref name="Walker-Barnes"/&gt;

The [[historicity]] of the mammy figure is questionable. Historical accounts point to the identity of most female domestic servants as [[Adolescence|teenagers]] and [[Youth|young adults]], not "grandmotherly types" such as the mammy. [[Melissa Harris-Perry]] has argued that the mammy was a creation of the imagination of the [[White supremacy]], which reimagined the powerless, coerced slave girls as soothing, comfortable, and consenting women.&lt;ref name="Walker-Barnes"/&gt; In 1981, [[Andy Warhol]] included the mammy in his Myths series, alongside other mythological and folklore characters such as [[Santa Claus]], [[Mickey Mouse]], and [[Superman]].&lt;ref name="Walker-Barnes"/&gt;

In ''Mammy. A Century of Race, Gender, and Southern Memory'' (2008), Kimberly Wallace-Sanders argued that the mammy's stereotypical attributes point to the source of her inspiration: "a long lasting and troubled marriage of racial and gender [[essentialism]], [[Folklore of the United States|mythology]], and southern [[nostalgia]].&lt;ref name="Walker-Barnes"/&gt;

The romanticized mammy image survives in the popular imagination of the modern United States. Chanequa Walker-Barnes, a licensed psychologist, argues that [[political correctness]] has led to the mammy figure being less prevalent in the 21st century culture, but the mammy archetype still influences the portrayal of African-American women in fiction, as good caretakers, nurturing, selfless, strong, and supportive, the [[supporting character]]s to white [[protagonist]]s. She cites as examples [[Miranda Bailey]], [[Mercedes Jones]], and [[Good Luck Charlie#Recurring characters|Ivy Wentz]].&lt;ref name="Walker-Barnes"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
The mammy was usually portrayed as an [[Old age|older woman]], [[overweight]], and [[dark skin]]ned. She was an idealized figure of a caregiver: amiable, loyal, maternal, non-threatening, obedient, and submissive. The mammy figure demonstrated [[deference]] to white authority. On occasion, the mammy was also depicted as a sassy woman. She was devoted to her owners/employers and her primary goal in life was to care for their needs. Some portrayals had the mammy have a family of her own. But her caregiving duties would always come first, leading to the mammy being portrayed as a neglectful parent or grandparent.&lt;ref name="Walker-Barnes"/&gt; And while the mammy was devoted to her white family, she often treated her own family poorly. Moreover, she had no black friends. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ferris.edu/jimcrow/mammies/|title=The Mammy Caricature|last=|first=|date=|website=Ferris Statue University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sister Citizen: Shame, Stereotypes, and Black Women in America'' (2011) by [[Melissa Harris-Perry]] describes the relationship between the mammy and other African Americans: "Mammy was not a protector or defender of black children or communities. She represented a maternal ideal, but not in caring for her own children. Her love, doting, advice, correction, and supervision were reserved exclusively for white women and children." &lt;ref name="Walker-Barnes"/&gt;

The mammy was contrasted with the [[Stereotypes of African Americans#Jezebel|Jezebel stereotype]] which depicted younger African-American women as conniving and [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]]. The mammy was occasionally depicted as a religious woman. More often than not, the mammy was an [[Asexuality|asexual]] figure, "devoid of any personal desires that might tempt her to sin". This helped the mammy serve as both a [[confidant]] and a moral guide to her young charges, capable of keeping them in line.&lt;ref name="Walker-Barnes"/&gt;

''Mammy. A Century of Race, Gender, and Southern Memory'' (2008) by Kimberly Wallace-Sanders includes other characteristics of the mammy. A large dark body, a round smiling face, a deeply sonorous and effortlessly soothing voice, a raucous laugh. Her personal attributes include infinite patience, self-deprecating wit, an implicit understanding and acceptance of her own inferiority, and her devotion to whites.&lt;ref name="Walker-Barnes"/&gt; The mammy was also large-breasted, desexualized, and potentially hostile towards men. Many of these characteristics were denied to African-American female slaves but were generally attributed to the mammy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mammy: A Century of Race, Gender, and Southern Memory|last=Wallace-Sanders|first=Kimberly|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=2008|isbn=0472034014|location=Ann Arbor|pages=3,6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manner of dress===
The dress often reflected the status of her owner. The mammy was usually neat and clean and wore attire that was suitable for her domestic duties. Sometimes a mammy considered herself to be dressed up, but that was usually just an addition of a bonnet and a silk velvet mantle, which probably belonged to her mistress.&lt;ref name="The Journal of Negro History"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2714687 ''The Journal of Negro History'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Like most of the slaves at that time, the mammy was often illiterate though intelligent in her own sense. Among many of the slaves, there could have been a mammy who possessed the abilities to read and write, often taught to her by the children of the family for whom she worked. However, as intelligent as she might have been, most of her intelligence was a result of past experiences and conflicts.  In particular, a mammy of an aristocratic family could be identified by her air of refinement.&lt;ref name="The Journal of Negro History"/&gt;

===Living conditions===
When the mammy did not stay in the house of her master or was not busy attending to the needs of the master's children, she would usually live with her husband and children in a cabin that was distinguished from the cabins of the other slaves in either size or structure. Her cabin stood near the master's house but at a distance from the cabins of the other slaves.&lt;ref name="The Journal of Negro History"/&gt;

Although the duties were far less tiring and strenuous than those of the other slaves, her hours were often long, leaving little time for her own leisure. It was not until the mammy had become too old for these duties that she would enjoy any home life of her own, since she was always preoccupied with the home life of her master. There was a flexibility about the mammy's duties that distinguished her from just being an ordinary nurse or a [[wet nurse]], even though there was a possibility that she could perform either of these tasks. In some of the more wealthy households, the mammy had assistants that would help her take care of the household's children. These women were often much younger than the mammy herself.&lt;ref name="The Journal of Negro History"/&gt;

The mammy, unlike the other slaves, was usually not up for sale, and the children of the mammy would be kept in the same family for as long as possible, retaining the same relationships that the mammy had with the master.&lt;ref name="The Journal of Negro History"/&gt;

==Roles in plantation households==
The role of the mammy in plantation households grew out of the roles of African-American slaves on the plantation. African-American slaves played vital roles in the plantation household. The majority of these duties generally were related to caring for the children of the family, thus relieving the mistress of the house of all the drudgery work that is associated with child care. When the children had grown up and were able to take care of themselves properly, the mammy's main role was to help the mistress with household tasks. As her years of service with the family increased, the mammy's sphere of influence increased as well. She was next to the mistress in authority and had the ability to give orders to everybody in the house.&lt;ref name="The Journal of Negro History"/&gt;

The mammy was often considered to be part of the family as much as its blood members were considered. Although she was considered of a lower status, she was still included in the inner circle. She has often been referred to as a "unique type of foster motherhood". Aside from just tending to the needs of the children, the mammy was also responsible for teaching the proper [[etiquette]] to them, such as addressing the elders on the plantation as "aunt" or "uncle", as well as what was best to say on a particular occasion and what was not. The mammy was able to discipline her charges whenever they performed something undesirable and was able to retain their respect towards her, even after the children had grown to adults.&lt;ref name="The Journal of Negro History"/&gt;

==Media portrayal==
[[File:Mammy's Cupboard Restaurant, Natchez, Mississippi, by Carol M. Highsmith.jpg|thumb|right|"[[Mammy's Cupboard]]", 1940 [[novelty architecture]] restaurant in Adams County, Mississippi.]]

Like the image of [[Aunt Jemima]], the image of the mammy was given a contemporary makeover as well as she appeared in television [[situation comedy|sitcoms]]. Some of the more contemporary features that the mammy received were that her head rag was removed and she became smaller, as well as lighter in complexion. In addition, her owner was not always white.&lt;ref name="From Mammy to Miss America and Beyond"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=wVTdO9WFB_8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=from+mammy+to+miss+america+and+beyond&amp;ots=VLJiBMsexR&amp;sig=j1j5Y2lLK9aJvmzboVUNvd5A-60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false From Mammy to Miss America and Beyond]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporary television sitcoms which featured mammies include ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'', where the character Florida, played by [[Esther Rolle]], worked as a domestic for a white family. A spin-off titled ''[[Good Times]]'' was made, where Rolle's character became the center of the series; the show focused on her family, which lived generally happy lives in a low-income housing project. Other television series that featured mammies as characters include ''[[That's My Mama]]'', ''[[Gimme a Break!]]'' and ''[[What's Happening!!]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

When other contemporary mammies emerged, they usually retained their occupation as a domestic and exhibited these physical feature changes; however, their emotional qualities remained intact. These contemporary mammies continued to be quick-witted and remained highly opinionated. A new twist in the outlook of the contemporary mammy occurred in the sitcom ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', where Florence, a maid played by [[Marla Gibbs]], worked for an affluent African-American family.&lt;ref name="Mythification of the Mammy Figure" /&gt;

One of the more recent caricatures that still exist in today's society is [[Tyler Perry]]'s Madea character. Madea is a massive heavyset black woman who is known for her violent acts throughout the Perry films. She contributes the stereotypes about African-American women being bitter, mean, and violent towards everyday people. Perry also has another character that contributes to the stereotypes among the African-American community which is the "Crack Mother" caricature. He received a lot of backlash for regenerating this myth of black mothers. In the sitcom ''[[The House of Paynes]]'' there is a crack mother character who cannot provide for her children and she undergoes the stereotypical detoxification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Construction of the Crack Mother Icon|last = Carpenter|first = Tracy|date = December 1, 2012|journal= Western Journal of Black Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, mammy characters were a staple of [[minstrel show]], giving rise to many sentimental show tunes dedicated to or mentioning mammies, including [[Al Jolson]]'s ''[[My Mammy (song)|My Mammy]]'' from ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' and [[Judy Garland]]'s performance of ''[[Swanee (song)|Swanee]]'' from ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star is Born]]'' (a song originally made popular by Jolson). Various mammy characters appeared in radio and TV shows. One prominent example was the radio and later short-lived television series ''[[Beulah (series)|Beulah]]'', which featured a black maid named Beulah who helped solve a white family's problems. In the 1940s and early 1950s, [[Mammy Two Shoes]], the housekeeper in the [[Tom and Jerry]] shorts, presented an animated example of the mammy, complete with dark skin and a [[African American Vernacular English|black accent]]. As a parody of this stereotype, the 1984 [[Frank Zappa]] album ''[[Thing-Fish]]'' featured characters called "mammy nuns".

In the early 20th century, the mammy character was common in many films. [[Hattie McDaniel]] won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for her performance as "Mammy" in ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' in 1939.&lt;ref name="Haskell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Haskell |first=Molly |title=Frankly, My Dear: Gone With the Wind Revisited |series=Icons of America |year=2010 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |isbn=978-0-300-16437-4 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=V-g1USyUYIwC&amp;pg=PA213 213]–[https://books.google.com/books?id=V-g1USyUYIwC&amp;pg=PA214 214]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common roles in American mass media seeming to be reserved for the mammy stereotype include [[secretary|secretaries]], [[Medical assistant|hospital/medical practice assistants]] and [[greasy spoon]] [[diner]] waitresses.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Mohegan-Pequot''' (also known as '''Mohegan-Pequot-Montauk''', '''Secatogue''', and '''Shinnecock-Poosepatuck'''; dialects in New England included Mohegan, Pequot, and Niantic; and on Long Island, Montauk and Shinnecock) is an extinct [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]] formerly spoken by indigenous peoples in southern present-day [[New England]] and eastern [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M.

==History==
[[File:Lester Skeesuk.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Lester Skeesuk, a Narraganset-Mohegan, in traditional dress]]
The Mohegan Indian Tribe was historically based in central southern Connecticut. While originally part of the [[Pequot people]], it gradually became independent and allied with [[English colonists]] in the [[Pequot War]] of 1637. This broke the power in the region of the Pequot who were formerly the dominant tribe. In reward, the English gave Western Pequot taken as captives to the Mohegan.

===20th century to present===
In 1933 John E. Hamilton, also known as Chief Rolling Cloud, was appointed Grand Sachem for Life of the Mohegan by his mother, Alice Storey.&lt;ref name=Hamilton-obit&gt;{{cite news|title=Passings: John E.

Storey was a direct descendant of [[Uncas]], the great 17th-century leader of the Mohegan Nation, and of Tamaquashad, Grand Sachem of the Pequot Nation. In Mohegan tradition, the position of tribal leadership called Grand Sachem had always been hereditary through the maternal line.

[[Gladys Tantaquidgeon]], who died at the age of 106 in 2005, served for years as the Tribe's [[medicine woman]] and unofficial historian. She became an anthropologist and worked for a decade with the federal [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. Returning to Connecticut, she operated her family's tribal Tantaquidgeon Museum for more than 50 years, beginning in 1947.&lt;ref name="Alumni"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/sasalum/newsltr/summer2001/running.html |title=Running Against Time - Medicine Woman Preserves Mohegan Culture|work= School of Anthropology; Alumni Newsletter |date=Summer 2001 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first museums to be owned and operated by Native Americans.&lt;ref name=PressRoom&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mohegan Tribe Celebrates Re-Opening of Tantaquidgeon Museum|url=http://www.mohegan.nsn.us/PressRoom/ViewPressRelease.aspx?articleID=97|work=Press Room|publisher=The Mohegan Tribe|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Hamilton was a key figure among Native American leaders initiating late twentieth century land claims suits. Tribes in the Northeast had long interaction with European Americans. There was continued encroachment of their lands, even when colonial-era reservations were established. By the early 20th century, many of the tribes in the Northeast were essentially landless.

In the period of mid- and late-20th century increased Native American activism, the Mohegan and other Northeast tribes filed federal land claims suits seeking to recover land or compensation for what they had lost. The courts ruled in their favor, in cases in which states had conducted illegal arrangements with tribal leaders, without gaining US Senate approval. Congress passed bills to ratify these settlements, which often involved compensation for lands lost, or land set aside for the tribes, and sometimes compensation, in addition to official federal recognition of the groups as tribes. The so-called "state tribes" were those along the East Coast who had been recognized by the [[English Crown]] through treaties and other documentation long before individual colonial or state governments had been established. But, as the Native people lost their traditional lands and were not assigned reservations, they did not maintain their sovereign legal status associated with federal recognition.

In the 1960s, during a period of rising activism among Native Americans, Hamilton filed a number of land claims authorized by the "Council of Descendants of Mohegan Indians." The group had some 300 members at the time.

In 1970 the [[Montville, Connecticut]] faction of the Mohegan expressed its dissatisfaction with Hamilton's land-claims litigation. They wanted a change in direction. When the Hamilton supporters left a council meeting, the remainder elected [[Courtland Fowler]] as their new leader. Notes of that Council meeting referred to Hamilton as ''[[Sachem]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nativeamericanmohegans.com/mohegan%5Fhistory/contemp.htm "Contemporary History of Mohegan, 1933-2002"], Native American Mohegans&lt;/ref&gt;

The group led by John Hamilton worked with the attorney Jerome Griner in federal land claims through the 1970s. The Fowler faction opposed this. In addition, a [[Kent, Connecticut]] property owners' organization, with native and non-native members, opposed the Hamilton land claims and the petition for federal recognition. These people were worried that their property values might be affected. 

==={{anchor|recognition}}Federal process for recognition=== &lt;!-- Gladys Tantaquidgeon article links to anchor--&gt;
In response to the petitions by additional tribes seeking federal recognition, in 1978 the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) established a formal administrative process and criteria to be satisfied to prove cultural continuity; they established these in consultation with federally recognized tribes. That year, as authorized by the Council of Descendants, Hamilton submitted the Mohegan Tribe's first petition for federal recognition.

John Hamilton died in 1988. In his will, he named Eleanor Fortin as the Grand Sachem of the Mohegan people. She became the leader of the "Hamilton group," which continued to contend with the "Fowler faction" over tribal policy. Despite their disagreements, both groups continued to participate in tribal activities and to identify as Mohegan people.

By 1989, the Fowler faction had revived Hamilton's 1978 petition for federal recognition, which had been dormant for some years. The BIA's preliminary finding was that the Mohegan had not satisfied the criteria of documenting continuity in social community, and demonstrating political authority and influence as a tribe, through the twentieth century.

In 1990, the Mohegan under Fowler submitted a detailed response to address the BIA's concerns. They included compiled genealogies and other records, some of which had been collected and preserved by Hamilton and his followers. For instance, Eleanor Fortin had allowed the MTIC (Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut) researchers access to records pertaining to the Mohegan [[Congregational Church]] in Montville. The researchers had assured Fortin that if federal recognition were achieved, it would cover the entire surviving Mohegan population.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} They also used records maintained by [[Gladys Tantaquidgeon]], who had kept genealogy and vital statistics of tribal members for her anthropological research.&lt;ref name="Alumni"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/02/nyregion/02tantaquidgeon.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1321801277-FS8QvehYlL6sZ0Q/rzZiWA Associated Press, "Gladys Tantaquidgeon, Mohegans' Medicine Woman, Is Dead at 106"], ''New York Times'', 2 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the MTIC ruled the tribe's membership be restricted to documented descendants from a single family, ca. 1860. This criteria excludes some of the Hamilton followers. By law, a federally recognized tribe has the authority to determine its own rules for membership. The MTIC tried to sue other Mohegan over their use of the tribal identity as well as their crafting, but they were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="MTICv.MTN"&gt;[http://www.jud.ct.gov/external/supapp/Cases/AROcr/cr130.pdf ''MTIC v. MTN''], Judiciary of Connecticut&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final determination, 1994===
In its 1994 "Final Determination," the BIA cited the vital statistics and genealogies as documents that were decisive in demonstrating "that the tribe did indeed have social and political continuity during the middle of the 20th century."&lt;ref name="finalDet"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/FR-1994-07-20/94-17687/content-detail.html "Final Determination that the Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut Does Exist as an Indian Tribe"], ''Federal Register,'' Vol. 59, No. 50, 15 March 1994, accessed 18 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The former Fowler group gained federal recognition as the '''Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut''' (MTIC). They do not acknowledge John Hamilton as Grand Sachem in their history, but say that [[Harold Tantaquidgeon]] was their chief prior to the era of federal recognition.

That same year, Congress passed the [[Mohegan Nation (Connecticut) Land Claim Settlement Act]], which authorized the United States to take land into trust to establish a reservation for the Mohegan and settle their land claim. The final 1994 agreement between MTIC and the State in the settlement of land claims extinguished all pending land claims.&lt;ref name="finalDet"/&gt;

The '''Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut''' is the only federally recognized tribe of the Mohegan people.

Descendants of the followers of John Hamilton continue to function as a Mohegan band independently of the MTIC. They hold periodic gatherings and activities.

=== Language endangerment and revitalization efforts ===

As of 2014, there are between 1,400 and 1,700 recorded tribal members (these figures vary by source). The Mohegan language has been dormant for approximately 100 years; the last native speaker, [[Fidelia Fielding|Fidelia A.H. Fielding]], died in 1908. Fielding, a descendant of Chief Uncas, is deemed the preserver of the language. She left four diaries that are being used in the 21st-century process of restoring the language. She also took part in preserving the traditional culture. She practiced a traditional Mohegan way of life and was the last person to live in the traditional log dwelling.&lt;!-- Do we have picture of this? --&gt;

Another important tribal member was [[Gladys Tantaquidgeon]], who was the tribe's medicine woman from 1916 until her death in 2005. She too assisted greatly in maintaining the Mohegan culture, as she collected thousands of tribal documents and artifacts. These documents were of critical importance to supporting the tribe's documentation for its case for federal recognition, which was approved in 1994.

As of 2010, the [[Shinnecock Indian Nation|Shinnecock]] and [[Unkechaug Nation|Unkechaug]] nations of [[Long Island, New York]], had begun work with the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]], Southampton Campus, to revive their languages, or dialects of the above.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Cohen, "Indian Tribes Go in Search of Their Lost Languages", ''New York Times'', 6 Apr 2010, C1, C5&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of 2012, the [http://www.moheganlanguage.com/ Mohegan Language Project] had created lessons, a dictionary, and other online learning materials to revive their language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| title = Mohegan Language Project
| accessdate = 2012-11-12
| url = http://www.moheganlanguage.com/
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project also has a complete grammar in the works, which has been put together by Stephanie Fielding. The primary goal of the project is for the next generation of Mohegan people to be fluent.

Many of the dictionaries circulating are based on Prince and Speck's interpretation of testimony by the Mohegan woman, ''Dji's Butnaca'' (Flying Bird), also known as [[Fidelia Fielding|Fidelia A.H. Fielding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The language was documented as early as the 17th century.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In 1690, a Pequot vocabulary list was compiled by Rev. [[James Noyes]] in [[Groton (city), Connecticut|Groton]]. In 1717, [[Experience Mayhew]], a [[Congregational]] Minister translated the [[Lord's Prayer]] into Mohegan-Pequot. [[Ezra Stiles]], president of [[Yale University]] collected Pequot linguistic data in Groton in 1762."&lt;ref name="Libby"/&gt;

[[Bahá'í]] prayers have been translated into the Mohegan-Pequot language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

"It is a sacred obligation," says the [[Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation|Golden Hill Paugussett]] Chief, [[Aurelius H. Piper, Sr.|Big Eagle]]. "Indian people must keep their languages alive. If the language is not spoken, it must be made to live again."&lt;ref name="Libby"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Nouns'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name="Fielding, Stephanie 2006"&gt;Fielding, Stephanie (2006), A Modern Mohegan Dictionary 2006 Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nouns in Mohegan have two forms: animate and inanimate. They are further distinguished by number. Animate nouns include people, animals, heavenly bodies (sun, moon, stars, but not clouds), and spirits. There are other items that call fall into the category of animate such as certain cultural items and plants, but it is not known why these items are considered animate. It is something that is simply learned and memorized. One way to help identify if a noun is animate or inanimate is to look at its plural form. Plural animate nouns typically end  in ''-k'' while plural inanimate nouns ends in ''-sh''.

Animate nouns have four forms: singular, plural, obviative and locative. The obviative form is used when there are two or more animate third persons in a sentence. The obviative is used when a noun or pronoun is the object of the verb (the object is the obviate), or if the third person is possessed by another person. The locative is used to show where something is spatially. Note that there is no obviative form for inanimate nouns, and neither the obviative nor the locative have plural forms (plurality is known through context).

&lt;big&gt;'''Verbs'''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;ref name="Fielding, Stephanie 2006"/&gt;

Verbs in Mohegan come in several forms. Independent verbs exist in four forms: inanimate intransitive, animate intransitive, transitive inanimate and transitive animate. There is also the conjunct form which does not carry the affixes (used to clarify person) that the aforementioned hold.

== Person, number and gender ==

'''&lt;big&gt;Person&lt;/big&gt;'''&lt;ref name="Fielding, Stephanie 2006"/&gt;

Mohegan animate intransitive verbs show who the subject is by utilizing affixes. Singular forms have prefixes, but third person (singular and plural) only have suffixes. In the plural forms there are inclusive and exclusive suffixes; the inclusive ''we'' includes the person who is speaking as well as the person he/she is talking to whereas the exclusive ''we'' does not include the person the speaker is talking to. When an animate intransitive verb stem ends in a long vowel (''á, i, o'' or ''ô'') the 3rd person singular does not take a final ''-w'', and in the 3rd person plural these same verbs take ''-k'' as an ending in lieu of ''- wak''.

== Space ==

&lt;big&gt;'''Locative case'''&lt;/big&gt;

The locative case is used to show where something is. Mohegan utilizes the suffix ''-uk'' to indicate spatial relationships, which can be compared to the English prepositions "on," "at," and "in." In Mohegan there is no plural form to go with the obviative and the locative: the same form is used for singular and plural with the difference being distinguished by context.

&lt;big&gt;'''Absentative case'''&lt;/big&gt;

The absentative case is used to when referencing a person who has died (this includes any property that they left behind). This is accomplished by adding a suffix to either his/her name, title or the property.

== Syntax ==

'''Possession'''

In Mohegan any noun can be possessed, however, there is a distinction in possessive relationships and that is the alienability distinction. Some nouns are able to stand alone without showing possession (alienable), while others must show a possessor (inalienable).

Nouns pertaining to kinship and body parts are always classified as inalienable, but there are some terms that don't fall under either of these umbrellas that must be classified as inalienable such as the noun "home." Various affixes are used to denote inalienability and different affixes are used to differentiate animate/inanimate and singular/plural. Additionally, when a term requires possession but the possessor is unclear or unknown it is marked with prefix that indicates an indefinite possessor.

The locative (''-uk'') and obviate (''-ah'') suffixes are added to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person singular forms. Whether the word is singular or plural should be suggested in the content of the sentence. The obviate affixes only go on animate nouns.

When a possessed noun is plural it must be shown. With an animate noun then suffix ''-ak'' is combined with the possessive ending (with the exception of third person singular and third person plural, where the plural is the same as the singular).

'''Clause Combining'''

In Mohegan grammar verbs that are in a dependent clause are said to be in the conjunct order. Conjunct verbs have the same numbers of persons for each verb, but they do not have prefixes, only suffixes. In turn, all of the person information is at the end of the word.

Example: Mô yáyuw maci ''ákacu'''yǒn'''''.

Translation: It was so bad ''that I am ashamed''.

When in the conjunct form if the first vowel of the word is a short vowel, that is /a/ or /u/, it changes to a long /á/.

Transitive verbs with inanimate objects take only a suffix as well. The suffix vary based on the ending of the stem.

For stems that end in -m- or -n- the suffixes are as follows:

1st person singular: -ôn

2nd person singular: -an

3rd person singular: -k

1st person plural: -ak

2nd person plural: -áq

3rd person plural: -hutut

3rd person plural participle: -kik

Indefinite subject (passive): -uk

For stems that end in -o- the suffixes are as follows:

1st person singular: -yôn

2nd person singular: -yan

3rd person singular: -ôk

1st person plural: -yak

2nd person plural: -yáq

3rd person plural: -w'hutut

3rd person plural participle: -ôkik

Indefinite subject (passive): -muk

For stems that end in -u- the suffixes are as follows:

1st person singular: -wôn

2nd person singular: -wan

3rd person singular: -k

1st person plural: -wak

2nd person plural: -wáq

3rd person plural: -'hutut

3rd person plural participle: -kik

Indefinite subject (passive): -muk

In art and [[iconography]], a '''motif''' {{Audio|en-us-motif.ogg|(pronunciation)}} is an element of an [[image]].  A motif may be repeated in a [[pattern]] or design, often many times, or may just occur once in a work.&lt;ref name=LatinArt&gt;{{cite web |title=Art glossary |url=http://www.latinart.com/glossary.cfm?sort=M |publisher=LatinArt.com |accessdate=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of motif==

A motif may be an element in the iconography of a particular subject or type of subject that is seen in other works, or may form the main subject, as the [[Master of Animals]] motif in ancient art typically does. The related motif of [[confronted animals]] is often seen alone, but may also be repeated, for example in [[Byzantine silk]] and other ancient textiles.  Where the main subject of an artistic work such as a painting is a specific person, group, or moment in a narrative, that should be referred to as the "subject" of the work, not a motif, though the same thing may be a "motif" when part of another subject, or part of a work of [[decorative art]] such as a painting on a vase.

[[Ornament (art)|Ornament]]al or [[decorative art]] can usually be analysed into a number of different elements, which can be called motifs. These may often, as in [[Fiber art|textile art]], be repeated many times in a pattern. Important examples in Western art include [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]], [[egg and dart]],&lt;ref&gt;Lucy T. Shoe, ''Profiles of Greek Mouldings'' 1936, supplemented by Shoe, "Greek Mouldings of Kos and Rhodes", ''Hesperia'' '''19'''.4 (October - December 1950:338-369 and illustrations)&lt;/ref&gt; and various types of [[scrollwork]].

[[File:Elibelinde2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Elibelinde]] [[kilim motifs]], symbolising [[fertility]]]]

Many designs in [[Islamic culture]] are motifs, including those of the sun, moon, animals such as horses and lions, flowers, and landscapes. Motifs can have emotional effects and be used for propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctc.usma.edu/pdf/CTC%20--%20Islamic%20Imagery%20Project.pdf Motifs in Jihadi Internet Propaganda]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[kilim]] flatwoven carpets, [[kilim motifs|motifs]] such as the hands-on-hips [[elibelinde]] are woven in to the design to express the hopes and concerns of the weavers: the elibelinde symbolises the female principle and [[fertility]], including the desire for children.&lt;ref name=Erbek&gt;{{cite book |author=Erbek, Güran |title=Kilim Catalogue No. 1 |publisher =May Selçuk A. S. Edition=1st |date=1998 |pages=4–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IntegrityBarnstar.png|thumb|[[Pennsylvania Dutch]] motif known as a [[hex sign]]]]
Pennsylvania Dutch hex signs are a familiar type of motif in the eastern portions of the United States. Their circular and symmetric design, and their use of brightly colored patterns from nature, such as stars, compass roses, doves, hearts, tulips, leaves, and feathers have made them quite popular. In some parts of Pennsylvania Dutch country, it is common to see these designs decorating barns and covered bridges.

The idea of a motif has become used more broadly in discussing [[literature]] and other narrative arts for [[Motif (narrative)|an element in the story]] that represents a [[theme (arts)|theme]].&lt;ref name="Grayson"&gt;James H.

'''Neil McBride''' ({{lang-ga|Niall Mac Giolla Bhrighde}}; 1861-1942) was a farmer, poet, author, and songwriter from Feymore, [[Creeslough]], [[County Donegal|Donegal, Ireland]], who further gained notoriety for protesting a fine he received for having his name written in [[Irish language|Irish]] on his business cart.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/132906397|title=Niall McBride|last=Scharf|first=Margaret Kelly|date=July 16, 2014|website=www.findagrave.com|publisher=|access-date=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historic encounter with the law ==
On the evening of March 11, 1905, returning home from the [[Dunfanaghy]] Fair, Neil was stopped by a [[Police officer|'bobby']], who fined him one shilling for having 'illegible' [[Irish language|(Irish)]] writing on the signage of his donkey cart. Neil was a farmer by trade and all business carts were required to display its owner's name in English. The sign on Neil's cart defiantly read, "''&lt;span lang="ga" dir="ltr"&gt;N. MAC GIOLLA ḂRIĠDE FIOḊ-MÓR&lt;/span&gt;''". The sign was printed by Neil's friend and poet, Andrew Mac Intyre. Neil refused to pay the fine and defended himself at the Dunfanaghy [[Petty session|Petty Session]]. He lost, and was penalized an additional shilling after still refusing to pay.

The [[Conradh na Gaeilge]] ("Gaelic League") learned of Neil's story and made efforts to help him. One of its members, attorney [[Patrick Pearse]], seeing the opportunity to champion Irish independence, agreed to defend McBride, [[pro bono]]. McBride's appeal was brought before the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]] in Dublin. It was Pearse's first and only court appearance as a [[barrister]]. The case was lost, but it inspired Pearse in his endeavors as a political activist and spawned a national campaign to change British government policies towards the [[Irish language]].&lt;ref name="An Trucailín Donn"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://northernirelandscreen.co.uk/news/6086/an-trucailn-donn-tuesday-12th-january-930pm-tg4.aspx|title=An Trucailín Donn|last=|first=|date=January 8, 2016|website=www.northernirelandscreen.co.uk|publisher=Northern Ireland Screen|access-date=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pearse wrote about the court's decision in his June 27, 1905 column in the Gaelic League newspaper, ''[[An Claidheamh Soluis]]'': "''...it was in effect decided that Irish is a foreign language on the same level with Yiddish.''" Continuing in the article, Pearse urges the people of Ireland to promote the Irish Language as a form of [[Irish nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Man Called Pearse|last=Desmond|first=Ryan|publisher=BiblioBazaar|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGill|first=P.J.|year=1966|title=Pearse Defends Niall Mac Giolla Bhríde in Court of King's Bench, Dublin|url=|journal=Donegal Annual|volume=1966|pages=83–85|via=(from June 27, 1905 article written by Patrick Pearse)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===
* Creeslough historian and author, Seamus Harkin featured Neil's poetry and songs in his 1996 book, ''‘Poets and People of Doe’''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000035718|title=Poets and people of Doe|last=Harkin|first=Seamus|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=|location=Ireland|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2011, Seamus Harkin updated and reissued ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Blaṫa Fraoiċ’ ,'' adding two extra songs, which Neil had composed after the original book was published. At the book's unveiling Seamus stated, "''My reason for printing this book is to let people, especially the young, know the great wealth of talent we had in the parish.''”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Liam Ó Connacháin wrote a biography about Neil in 1939 titled, "''Dírbheathaisnéis Néill Mhic Ghiolla Bhrighde''".

The '''''Northern Rhodesia Journal''''', often referred to simply as "NRJ", was produced between 1950 and 1965, by the Northern Rhodesian Government Printer, to record some of the early history of [[Northern Rhodesia]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrzam.org.uk/NRJ/NRJIndex/NRJindex.htm|title=New Page 1|website=Nrzam.org.uk|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spanglefish.com/northernrhodesiajournal/|title=Northern Rhodesia Journal as text - Home|website=Spanglefish.com|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the most important sources of historical information on [[Zambia]] before and during its colonial era, up to its independence from the [[United Kingdom]].

==Format==
The Journal is [[quarto]] in size.

The first two volumes comprised six "Numbers" each, and the page numbering started with 1 for each Number. For the remaining four volumes (the first three of which also had six Numbers) the pages in each volume were numbered continuously, started with page 1 in Number 1 of each volume. The final volume (VI) had but three Numbers, the pages numbered continuously, started with page 1 in Number 1,  and, as it was produced after [[History_of_Zambia#Independence_and_Cold_War|Independence]], was titled The ''Zambia Northern Rhodesia Journal''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spanglefish.com/northernrhodesiajournal|title=Northern Rhodesia Journal as text - Home|website=Spanglefish.com|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
From the "Editorial" of the first issue:-

''The difficulty is to state in a succinct fashion what our policy really is. It is easy to classify journals with restricted outlooks such as those concerned only with anthropological or agricultural or natural history interests. We too shall deal with all those topics but generally speaking we hope to draw into our net a catch of such variety that it cannot be easily classified.''

''We hope to bring to the general reader glimpses of the past history of this country and to place on record the events that have made recent history ; we shall relate the memoirs of men who have helped to mould the shape of our lives here or of men who have interesting tales to tell ; we shall open our columns to those who want to discuss facets of the wealth of animal and plant life of the Territory ; we shall write on the vast and variegated native culture that impinges on us at all times ; and, in fact, we shall be glad to publish anything of Northern Rhodesian interest that we believe to be of permanent or of literary value.''

==Significance==
The Journal has no cut-off dates; it covers ancient history right through to its "present day (1965).  One period of significant history which is covered is often called the period of ''welfare colonialism'' because of the impact of the ''[[Colonial Development and Welfare Acts]]'' of 1940 and 1945. These Acts were products of the same impulses which drove the [[Beveridge Report]] and the creation of the [[Welfare State]] in Britain after the second world war. The NRJ documents the remarkable results of the investments made under the provisions of the Acts in Northern Rhodesia, which added enhanced educational, health and agricultural development services to the settled peace and impartial rule of law that the Colonial Service provided and which was a fundamental reason for the popular support documented by historians among the African populations. It was the loss of that impartiality which was most bitterly regretted after independence, especially in [[Barotseland]], which became the Western Province of Zambia, and which felt itself to be systematically discriminated against by the independent government.  The resentment still smoulders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-17546620|title=Kingdom seeking to leave Zambia|date=29 March 2012|accessdate=28 November 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current retreat from ideological 'development', not least because of the evidence of unintended bad consequences of 'development' aid&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have done so much ill and so little Good|last=Easterly|first=William|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-19-921082-9|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the rediscovery of the importance of practical, grass-roots, value for money help, makes the case-evidence of contemporary journals like the NRJ especially valuable sources for organisations like Oxfam or the Dept for International Development.

'''''Pacific Science''''' is an international, multidisciplinary, academic journal devoted to the biological and physical sciences of the Pacific basin, focusing especially on [[biogeography]], [[ecology]], [[evolution]], [[geology]] and [[volcanology]], [[oceanography]], [[palaeontology]], and [[systematics]]. It has been published by the [[University of Hawaii Press|University of Hawai{{okina}}i Press]] since 1947, and serves as the official journal of the [[Pacific Science Association]].

Volume 1 lists [[A. Grove Day]] as the editor in chief of a general editorial board for the [[University of Hawaii]], where the editorship has remained. Leonard D. Tuthill of the Dept. of Zoology and Entomology served as editor of vols. 2-7 (1948–53); William A. Gosline of the Dept. of Zoology edited vols. 8-10 (1954–56) and vols. 22-25 (1968-71); and [[O. A. Bushnell]] of the Dept. of Microbiology edited vols. 11-21 (1957–67). The longest-serving editor was [[E. Alison Kay]] of the Dept. of General Science, then the Dept. of Zoology (from 1982), who edited vols. 26-54 (1972-2000), stepping down only after she retired. Gerald D. Carr of the Dept. of Botany edited vols. 55-58 (2001–04) and was succeeded by his departmental colleague, Curtis C. Daehler, from vol. 59 (2005).

The journal appears quarterly in January, April, July, and October. Its first electronic edition appeared in 2001 on [[Project MUSE]], which continues to host archives of vols. 55 (2001) through 61 (2007). The most current electronic edition is available on [[BioOne]], which also hosts archives going back to vol. 59 (2005).

Back issues of ''Pacific Science'' are archived online in the University of Hawaii at Mānoa's [[ScholarSpace]] [[institutional repository]].

[[File:Laelaps-Charles Knight-1897.jpg|thumb|350px|''Leaping [[Laelaps (dinosaur)|Laelaps]]'' by [[Charles R. Knight]], 1896]]
'''Paleoart''' (also spelled '''palaeoart''', '''paleo-art''', or '''paleo art''') is any original artistic work that attempts to reconstruct or depict prehistoric life according to the current knowledge and scientific evidence at the time of the artwork's creation.&lt;ref name="anson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ansón |first1=Marco |last2=Fernández |first2=Manuel H.|last3=Ramos |first3=Pedro A. S. |year=2015|title=Paleoart: term and conditions (A survey among paleontologists)|journal=Current trends in Paleontology and Evolution |volume= |issue= |pages=28–34 |url=https://www.academia.edu/12100885/Paleoart_term_and_conditions_a_survey_among_paleontologists_ |format= |accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "paleoart", which is a portmanteau of "art" and the ancient Greek word for "old", was introduced in the late 1980s by [[Mark Hallett (artist)|Mark Hallett]] for art that depicts subjects related to [[paleontology]],&lt;ref name="hallett"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hallett |first=Mark|authorlink=Mark_Hallett_(artist) |editor1-last=Czerkas |editor1-first=Sylvia J. |editor1-link=|editor2-last=Olson |editor2-first=Everett C. |editor2-link=  |date=1987 |chapter=The scientific approach of the art of bringing dinosaurs back to life |title=Dinosaurs Past and Present (vol 1) |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle|isbn13=978-0938644248 |pages=97–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is considered to have originated as a visual tradition in early 1800s England.&lt;ref name="witton2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Witton|first=Mark P.|title=The Palaeoartist's Handbook: Recreating prehistoric animals in art|year=2018|publisher=The Crowood Press Ltd.|location=U.K.: Ramsbury|ISBN13=978-1785004612}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lescaze&gt;{{Cite book | last= Lescaze | first=Zoë | title=Paleoart: Visions of the prehistoric past|year=2017 |publisher=Taschen |location=|isbn13=978-3836555111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Works of paleoart may be representations of fossil remains or depictions of the living creatures and their ecosystems. While paleoart is typically defined as being scientifically informed, it is also recognized as important in influencing depictions of prehistoric animals in popular culture media, which in turn influences public perception of, and fuels interest in, these animals.&lt;ref name="paul1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Paul|first=Gregory S.|editor-last=Paul|editor-first=Gregory S.|date=2000|chapter=A quick history of dinosaur art|title=The Scientific American Book of Dinosaurs|publisher=Byron Preiss Visual Productions, Inc.|location=New York|isbn13=978-0312262266 |pages=107–112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
A chief driver in the inception of paleoart as a distinct form of scientific illustration was the desire of both the public and of paleontologists to visualize the prehistory that fossils represented.&lt;ref name=anson /&gt; Mark Hallett, who coined the term "paleoart" in 1987, stressed the importance of the cooperative effort between artists, paleontologists and other specialists in gaining access to information for generating accurate, realistic restorations of extinct animals and their environments.&lt;ref name=hallett /&gt;&lt;ref name="hone"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hone|first1=Dave|title=Drawing dinosaurs: how is palaeoart produced?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/lost-worlds/2012/sep/03/drawing-dinosaurs-palaeoart|work=The Guardian|date=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since paleontological knowledge and public perception of the field have changed dramatically since the earliest attempts at reconstructing prehistory, paleoart as a discipline has consequently changed over time as well. This has led to difficulties in creating a shared definition of the term. Given that the drive towards scientific accuracy has always been a salient feature of the discipline, some authors point out the importance of separating true paleoart from "paleoimagery", which includes a variety of cultural and media depictions of prehistoric life in various manifestations.&lt;ref name=anson/&gt; One attempt to separate these terms has defined paleoartists as artists who "create original skeletal reconstructions and/or restorations of prehistoric animals, or restore fossil flora or invertebrates using acceptable and recognized procedures."&lt;ref name="debus"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Debus | first1=Allen A. |last2=Debus |first2=Diane E. |date=2002|title="Paleoimagery: The Evolution of Dinosaurs in Art | publisher=McFarland and Co. |location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0786464203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have pointed out that a definition of paleoart must include a degree of subjectivity, where an artist's style, preferences and opinions come into play along with the goal of accuracy.&lt;ref name="witton1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Witton |first=Mark P. |title=Recreating an Age of Reptiles |publisher=Crowood Press |isbn13=978-1785003349}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Society of Vertebrate Paleontology]] has offered the definition of paleoart as "the scientific or naturalistic rendering of paleontological subject matter pertaining to [[vertebrate]] fossils",&lt;ref name="svp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vertpaleo.org/Awards/Award-%2815%29.aspx |title=Society of Vertebrate Paleontology: Lanzendorf-National Geographic Paleoart Prize |accessdate=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a definition considered unacceptable by some for its exclusion of non-vertebrate subject matter.&lt;ref name=anson/&gt; Paleoartist [[Mark Witton]] defines paleoart in terms of three essential elements: 1) being bound by scientific data, 2) involving biologically-informed restoration to fill in missing data, and 3) relating to extinct organisms. This definition explicitly rules out technical illustrations of fossil specimens from being considered paleoart.&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt; This definition, which requires the use of "reasoned extrapolation and informed speculation" to fill in these reconstructive gaps, also explicitly rules out artworks that actively go against known published data. These might be more accurately considered [[Cultural depictions of dinosaurs|paleontologically-inspired art]].&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt;

In an attempt to establish a common definition of the term, Ansón &amp; colleagues (2015) conducted an empirical survey of the international paleontological community with a questionnaire on various aspects of paleoart. 78% of the surveyed participants stated agreement with the importance of scientific accuracy in paleoart, although 87% of respondents recognized an increase in accuracy of paleoart over time.&lt;ref name=anson /&gt;

==Production==
The production of paleoart requires by definition a substantial amount of research and reference-gathering to ensure scientific credibility at the time of production.&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt; The artist [[James Gurney]], known for the [[Dinotopia]] series of fiction books, has described this interaction between scientists and artists as the artist being the eyes of the scientist, since his illustrations bring shape to the theories; paleoart determines how the public perceives long extinct animals.&lt;ref name="gurney"&gt;{{cite book| last=Gurney | first=James |authorlink=James_Gurney |date=2009|title=Imaginative Realism: How to Paint What Doesn't Exist|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|location=Kansas City|isbn13=978-0740785504|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Olorotitan skeletal.png|thumb|right|An example of the skeletal reconstructions on which many paleoartists depend: ''[[Olorotitan]]'' by [[Andrey Atuchin]]]]
===Scientific principles===
Although every artist's process will differ, Witton (2018) recommends a standard set of requirements to produce artwork that fits the definition. A basic understanding of the subject organism's place in time ([[geochronology]]) and space ([[Biogeography#Paleobiogeography|paleobiogeography]]) is necessary for restorations of scenes or environments in paleoart. Skeletal reference—not just the bones of vertebrate animals, but including any fossilized structures that support soft tissue, such as lignified [[Vascular plant|plant tissue]] and [[coral]] framework—is crucial for understanding the proportions, size and appearance of extinct organisms. Given that many fossil specimens are known from fragmentary material, an understanding of the organisms' [[ontogeny]], [[Morphology (biology)|functional morphology]], and [[phylogeny]] may be required to create scientifically-rigorous paleoart by filling in restorative gaps parsimoniously.&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt;

===Artistic principles===
The success of a piece of paleoart depends on its strength of composition as much as any other genre of artistry. Command of object placement, color, lighting, and shape can be indispensable to communicating a realistic depiction of prehistoric life. Paleoart is unique in its compositional challenge in that its content must be imagined and inferred, as opposed to directly referenced, in many cases, including depictions of animal behavior and environmental topography. To this end, artists must keep in mind the mood and purpose of a composition in creating an effect piece of paleoart.&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt;

==History==
==="Proto-paleoart" (pre-1800)===
While the word "paleoart" is relatively recent, the practice of restoring ancient life based on real fossil remains can be considered to have originated around the same time as paleontology.&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt; However, art of extinct animals has existed long before [[Henry De la Beche]]'s 1830 painting ''Duria Antiquior'', which is often credited as the first true paleontological artwork.&lt;ref name=Lescaze /&gt; These older works include sketches, paintings and detailed anatomical restorations, though the relation of these works to observed fossil material is mostly speculative. For example, a [[Corinth]]ian vase painted sometime between 560 and 540 [[BCE]] is thought by some researchers to bear a depiction of an observed fossil skull. This so-called "Monster of Troy", the beast fought by the [[Greek mythology|mythological Greek]] hero [[Heracles]], somewhat resembles the skull of the [[giraffid]] ''[[Samotherium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mayor |first=Adrienne|year=2011|title=The First Fossil Hunters: Paleontology in Greek and Roman Times (second edition)|publisher=Princeton University Press|ISBN=0691150133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witton considered that because the painting has significant differences from the skull it is supposedly representing (lack of horns, sharp teeth) the evidence is lacking that it represents "proto-paleoart". Other scholars have suggested that ancient fossils inspired Grecian depictions of [[griffin]]s, with the mythical chimera of lion and bird anatomy superficially resembling the beak, horns and quadrupedal body plan and fossil of the dinosaur ''[[Protoceratops]]''. Similarly, authors have speculated that the huge, unified nasal opening in the skull of fossil mammoths could have inspired ancient artwork and stories of the one-eyed [[cyclops]]. However, these ideas have never been substantiated by evidence that isn't more parsimoniously explained by established cultural interpretations of these mythical figures.&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt;
[[Image:Klagenfurt_Lindwurm.jpg|thumb|left|The Klagenfurt Lindworm]] 
The earliest definitive works of "proto-paleoart" that unambiguously depict the life appearance of fossil animals come from fifteenth and sixteenth century Europe.  One such depiction is Ulrich Vogelsang's statue of a [[Lindwurm]] in [[Klagenfurt]], [[Austria]], that dates to 1590. Writings from the time of its creation specifically identify the skull of ''[[Coelodonta antiquitatis]]'', the woolly rhinoceros, as the basis for the head in the restoration. This skull had been found in a mine or gravel pit near Klagenfurt in 1335, and remains on display today. Despite its poor resemblance of the skull in question, the Lindwurm statue was thought to be almost certainly inspired by the find.&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt;

The German textbook ''[[Mundus Subterraneus (book)|Mundus Subterraneus]]'', authored by scholar [[Athanasius Kircher]] in 1678, features a number of illustrations of giant humans and [[dragon]]s that may have been informed by fossil finds of the day, many of which came from quarries and caves. Some of these may have been the bones of large [[Pleistocene]] mammals common to these European caves. Others may have been based on far older fossils of [[plesiosaur]]s, which are thought to have informed a unique depiction of a dragon in this book that departs noticeably from the classically slender, serpentine dragon artwork of the era by having a barrel-like body and 'paddle-like' wings. According to some researchers, this dramatic departure from the typical dragon artwork of this time, which is thought to have been informed by the Lindwurm, likely reflects the arrival of a new source of information, such as a speculated discovery of plesiosaur fossils in quarries of the historic [[Swabia (Bavaria)|Swabia]] region of [[Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abel|first=Othenio|year=1939|title=Vorzeitliche Tierreste im Deutschen Mthus, Brachtum und Volksglauben|publisher=Jena (Gustav Fischer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt;

Eighteenth century skeletal reconstructions of another mythical creature, the [[unicorn]], are thought to have been inspired by [[Last glacial period|Ice Age]] [[mammoth]] and [[rhinoceros]] bones found in a cave near [[Quedlinburg]], Germany, in 1663. These artworks are of uncertain origin and may have been created by [[Otto von Guericke]], the German naturalist who first described the "unicorn" remains in his writings, or [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], the author who published the image posthumously in 1749. This rendering represents the oldest known illustration of a fossil skeleton.&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ariew|first=R|title=Leibniz on the unicorn and various other curiosities|journal=Early Science and Medicine|vol=|issue=3|pages=39–50|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early scientific paleoart (1800–1890)===
[[Image:Hermann pterodactylus restoration1.png|thumb|right|Jean Hermann's 1800 restoration of the pterosaur ''[[Pterodactylus antiquus]]'']]
The beginning of the [[19th century]] saw the first paleontological artworks with an unambiguous scientific basis, and this emergence coincided with paleontology being seen as a distinct field of science. The French naturalist and professor [[Jean Hermann]] of [[Strasbourg, France]], drafted what Witton describes as the "oldest known, incontrovertible" pieces of paleoart in 1800.&lt;ref name="witton2"/&gt; These sketches, based on the first known fossil material skeleton of a pterosaur, depict Hermann's interpretation of the animal as a flying mammal with fur and large external ears. These ink drawings were relatively quick sketches accompanying his notes on the fossil and were likely never intended for publication, and their existence was only recently uncovered from correspondence between the naturalist artist and the French anatomist [[Baron Georges Cuvier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taquet|first1=P.|last2=Padian |first2=K.|year=2004|title=The earliest known restoration of a pterosaur and the philosophical origins of Curvier's Ossemens Fossiles |journal=Comptes Rendus Palevol |volume=3|pages=157–175|doi=10.1016/j.crpv.2004.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Boltunov mammoth.jpg|thumb|left|Roman Boltunov's 1805 reconstruction of a mammoth, based on frozen carcass he observed in Siberia]]
Similarly, private sketches of mammoth fossils drafted by [[Yakutsk]] merchant Roman Boltunov in 1805 were likely never intended for scientific publication, but their function—to communicate the life appearance of an animal whose tusks he had found in Siberia and was hoping to sell—nevertheless establishes it one of the first examples of paleoart by today's definition. Boltunov's sketches of the animal, which depicted it as trunkless and [[boar]]-like, raised enough scientific interest in the specimen that the drawings were later sent to [[St. Petersburg]] and eventually led to excavation and study of the rest of the specimen.&lt;ref name="witton2"/&gt;
[[Image:Buckland_hyena.jpg|thumb|right|Geologist William Conybeare's 1822 cartoon of William Buckland in a hyena den, intended to honor Buckland's groundbreaking analysis of fossils found at Kirkdale cave]]
Cuvier, Jean Hermann's correspondent whose attention later brought his pterosaur sketches to light, went on to produce skeletal restorations of extinct mammals of his own. Some of these included restorations with musculature layered atop them, which in the early 1820s could be considered the earliest examples of illustrations of animal tissue built up over fossil skeletons. As huge and detailed fossil restorations were at this point appearing in the same publications as these modest attempts at soft tissue restoration, historians have speculated whether this reflected shame and lack of interest in paleoart as being too speculative to have scientific value at the time.&lt;ref name="rudwick"&gt;{{cite book|last= Rudwick|first= M.J.|year = 1992|title= Scenes from Deep time: early pictorial representations of the prehistoric world|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable deviation from this approach is seen in a cartoon drawn by geologist [[William Conybeare (geologist)|William Conybeare]] in 1822. This cartoon depicts paleontologist [[William Buckland]] entering the famous British [[Kirkdale Cave]], known for its Ice Age mammal remains, amidst a scene of fossil [[hyena]]s restored in the flesh in the ancient cave interior, the first known artwork depicting an extinct animal restored in a rendition of an ancient environment.&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt; A similar step forward depicts a dragon-like animal meant to represent the pterosaur ''[[Dimorphodon]]'', flying over a coastline, by George Howman. This 1829 watercolor painting was a fanciful piece that, albeit being not particularly scientific, was another very early attempt at restoring a fossil animal in a suitable habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Martill|first= D. M.|year= 2014|title= ''Dimorphodon'' and the Reverend George Howman's noctivagous flying dragon: the earliest restoration of a pterosaur in its natural habitat|journal = Proceedings of the Geologists' Association|volume= 125|pages = 120–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Duria Antiquior.jpg|thumb|left|Geologist Henry De la Beche's 1830 watercolor painting ''Duria Antiquior - A more Ancient Dorset'', based on fossils found by Mary Anning]] 
In 1830, the first "fully realized" paleoart scene, depicting prehistoric animals in a realistic geological setting, was painted by British paleontologist [[Henry De la Beche]]. Dubbed ''Duria Antiquior — A more Ancient Dorset'', this watercolor painting represents a scene from the [[Early Jurassic]] of [[Dorset]], a fossil-rich region of the British Isles. This painting, based on fossil discoveries along the coast of Dorset by paleontologist [[Mary Anning]], showcased realistic aspects of fossil animal appearance, behavior, and environment at a level of detail, realism and accuracy that was among the very first of its kind.&lt;ref name="witton2"/&gt; This watercolor, an early illustration of [[paleoecology]], shows [[plesiosaur]]s and [[ichthyosaur]]s swimming and foraging in a natural setting, and includes depictions of behavior of these marine reptiles that, while unknown, were inferences made by De la Beche based on the behavior of living animals. For example, one ichthyosaur is painted with its mouth open about to swallow the fish head-first, just as a predatory fish would swallow another.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Jane P.|title=A History of Paleontology Illustration|date=2008|publisher=Indiana University Press|location= Bloomington|isbn13=978-0253351753}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of these animals are also depicted defecating, a theme that emerges in other works by De la Beche. For example, his 1829 lithograph called ''A [[coprolite|Coprolitic]] Vision'', perhaps inspired by Conybeare's Kirkdale Cave cartoon, again pokes fun at William Buckland by placing him at the mouth of a cave surrounded by defecating prehistoric animals. Several authors have remarked on De la Beche's apparent interest in fossilized feces, speculating that even the shape of the cave in this cartoon is reminiscent of the interior of an enormous digestive tract.&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt; In any case, ''Duria Antiquior'' inspired many subsequent derivatives, one of which was produced by Nicholas Christian Hohe in 1831 titled ''Jura Formation''. This piece, published by German paleontologist [[Georg August Goldfuss]], was the first paleoart scene to enter scientific publication, and was likely an introduction to other academics of the time to the potential of paleoart.&lt;ref name="rudwick"/&gt;
[[Image:Mantellodon in Crystal Palace Park.jpg|thumb|right|[[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]]'s 1850s sculptures of an ''[[Iguanodon]]'' pair, some of the [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs]]]]
The role of art in disseminating paleontological knowledge took on a new salience with the introduction of the term "dinosaur" by Sir [[Richard Owen]] in 1842. With only fragmentary fossil remains known at the time, the question of life appearance of dinosaurs captured the interest of scientist and public alike.&lt;ref name="felder"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colagrande |first1=John |last2=Felder |first2=Larry|title=In the Presence of Dinosaurs|date=2000|publisher=Time-Life Books|location=Alexandria, VA|isbn13=978-0737000894|pages=168–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Owen's help, [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]] created the first life-size sculptures depicting dinosaurs as he thought they may have appeared; he is considered by some to be the first significant artist to apply his skills to the field of dinosaur paleontology.&lt;ref name="paul1" /&gt; Some of these models were initially created for the [[Great Exhibition of 1851]], but 33 were eventually produced when [[the Crystal Palace]] was relocated to [[Sydenham]], in South London. Owen famously hosted a dinner for 21 prominent men of science inside the hollow concrete ''[[Iguanodon]]'' on New Year's Eve 1853. However, in 1849, a few years before his death in 1852, [[Gideon Mantell]] had realized that ''Iguanodon'', of which he was the discoverer, was not a heavy, [[Pachydermata|pachyderm]]-like animal,&lt;ref name=GM51&gt;{{cite book |last=Mantell |first=Gideon A. |title= Petrifications and their teachings: or, a handbook to the gallery of organic remains of the British Museum |year=1851 |publisher=H. G. Bohn |location=London |oclc= 8415138}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Owen was putting forward, but had slender forelimbs; his death left him unable to participate in the creation of the [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs|Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures]], and so Owen's vision of dinosaurs became that seen by the public. He had nearly two dozen life-sized [[sculpture]]s of various prehistoric animals built out of [[concrete]] sculpted over a [[steel]] and [[brick]] framework; two ''Iguanodon'', one standing and one resting on its belly, were included. The dinosaurs remain in place in the park, but their depictions are now outdated in many respects.
[[Image:Dinosaurs fighting - The World before the Deluge (1865), plate XXI - BL.jpg|thumb|right|[[Édouard Riou]]'s 1865 illustration of ''Iguanodon'' and ''[[Megalosaurus]]'' engaged in combat, from ''La Terre Avant le Deluge'']]
The Crystal Palace models, despite their inaccuracy by today's standards, were a landmark in the advancement of paleoart as not only a serious academic undertaking, but also one that can capture the interest of the general public. The Crystal Palace dinosaur models were the first works of paleoart to be merchandised as postcards, guide books, and replicas to the general public.&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt; In the latter half of the 1800s, this major shift could be seen in other developments taking place in academic books and paintings featuring scientific restorations of prehistoric life. For example, a book by French scientist [[Louis Figuier]] titled ''La Terre Avant le Deluge'', published in 1863, was the first to feature a series of works of paleoart documenting life through time. Illustrated by French painter [[Édouard Riou]], this book featured iconic scenes of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals based on Owen's constructions, and would establish a template for academic books featuring artworks of prehistoric life through time for years to come.&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt;

==="Classic" paleoart (1890–1970)===
As the [[American frontier|western frontier]] was further opened up in the latter half of the nineteenth century, the rapidly increasing pace of dinosaur discoveries in the bone-rich badlands of the [[American Midwest]] and the Canadian wilderness brought with it a renewed interest in artistic reconstructions of paleontological findings. This 'classic' period saw the emergence of [[Charles R. Knight]], [[Rudolph Zallinger]], and [[Zdeněk Burian]] as the three most prominent exponents of paleoart. During this time, dinosaurs were popularly reconstructed as tail-dragging, cold-blooded, sluggish "Great Reptiles" that became a byword for evolutionary failure in the minds of the public.&lt;ref name=White1&gt;{{Cite book | last= White | first=Steve | title=Dinosaur Art: The World's Greatest Paleoart|year=2012 |publisher=Titan Books |location=London |isbn13=978-0857685841 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Smilodon Knight.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Smilodon]]'' by Charles R. Knight (1903)]] 
Charles Knight is generally considered one of the key figures in paleoart during this time. His birth three years after [[Charles Darwin]]'s publication of the influential ''[[Descent of Man]]'', along with the "Bone Wars" between rival American paleontologists [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Othniel Marsh]] raging during his childhood, had poised Knight for rich early experiences in developing an interest in reconstructing prehistoric animals. As an avid wildlife artist who disdained drawing from mounts or photographs, instead preferring to draw from life, Knight grew up drawing living animals, but turned toward prehistoric animals against the backdrop of rapidly-expanding paleontological discoveries and the public energy that accompanied the sensationalist coverage of these discoveries around the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Knight&gt;{{Cite book | last= Milner | first=Richard | title=Charles R. Knight: The Artist Who Saw Through Time|year=2012 |publisher=Abrams |location=New York |isbn13=978-0810984790 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Knight's foray into paleoart can be traced to a commission ordered by Dr. Jacob Wortman of a painting of a prehistoric [[pig]], ''[[Elotherium]]'', to accompany its fossil display at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. Knight, who had always preferred to draw animals from life, applied his knowledge of modern pig anatomy to the painting, which so thrilled Wortman that the museum then commissioned Knight to paint a series of [[watercolor]]s of various fossils on display.&lt;ref name="Autobio"&gt;{{cite book |last=Knight|first=Charles Robert|title=Charles R.

[[Image:Knight entelodont.jpg|thumb|right|''Entelodon'' (then known as ''Elotherium''), the first commissioned restoration of an extinct animal by Charles R. Knight]]
Throughout the 1920s, '30s and '40s, Knight went on produce drawings, paintings and murals of dinosaurs, early man, and extinct mammals for the [[American Museum of Natural History]], where he was mentored by [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], and Chicago's [[Field Museum]], as well as for ''[[National Geographic]]'' and many other major magazines of the time, culminating in his last major mural for the [[Everhart Museum]] of Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 1951.&lt;ref name="Autobio" /&gt;  Biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] later remarked on the depth and breadth of influence that Knight's paleoart had on shaping public perception of extinct animals, even without having published original research in the field. Gould, who was a prominent fan and popularizer of Knight's works, used one of Knight's paintings for the cover of his 1991 book ''[[Bully for Brontosaurus]]'' and another in his 1996 book ''[[Dinosaur in a Haystack]]''. Gould described Knight's contribution to scientific understanding in his 1989 book ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]'': "Not since the Lord himself showed his stuff to Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones had anyone shown such grace and skill in the reconstruction of animals from disarticulated skeletons. Charles R. Knight, the most celebrated of artists in the reanimation of fossils, painted all the canonical figures of dinosaurs that fire our fear and imagination to this day".&lt;ref name="WorldCRK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charlesrknight.com |title=Welcome to the World of Charles R. Knight}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Knight's most famous pieces was his ''Leaping Laelaps'', which he produced for the American Museum of Natural History in 1897. This painting was one of the few works of paleoart produced before 1960 to depict dinosaurs as active, fast-moving creatures, heralding the next era of paleontological artworks informed by the [[Dinosaur Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Knight" /&gt;
[[Image:Lost World 1925 Still 01.jpg|thumb|left|Still of ''[[Triceratops]]'' from the 1925 film ''The Lost World'']]
[[Image:Triceratops - 1904.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of ''Triceratops'' created in 1904 by Charles R. Knight]]
Knight's illustrations also had a large and long-lasting influence on the depiction of prehistoric animals in popular culture. The earliest depictions of dinosaurs in  movies, such as the 1933 ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' film and the 1925 production of ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'', based on the [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] [[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|novel]] of the same name, relied heavily on Knight's dinosaur paintings to produce suitable dinosaur models that were realistic for the time. The special effects artist [[Ray Harryhausen]] would continue basing his movie dinosaurs on Knight illustrations up through the sixties, including for films such as the 1966 ''[[One Million Years B.C.]]'' and the 1969 ''[[Valley of Gwangi]]''.&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt;

Rudolph Zallinger and Zdeněk Burian both went on to influence the state of dinosaur art while Knight's career began to wind down. Zallinger, who began working for the [[Yale Peabody Museum]] illustrating [[marine algae]] around the time that the United States entered [[World War II]], began his most iconic piece of paleoart, a five-year mural project for the Yale Peabody Museum, in 1942. This mural, titled ''[[The Age of Reptiles]]'', was completed in 1947 and became representative of the modernist consensus of dinosaur biology at that time.&lt;ref name="paul1" /&gt; He later completed a second great mural for the Peabody, ''The Age of Mammals'', which grew out of a painting published in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peabody.yale.edu/collections/archives/biography/rudolph-franz-zallinger |title=Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History: Rudolph Franz Zallinger |accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zdeněk Burian followed the school of Knight and Zallinger, entering modern, biologically-informed paleoart scene via his extensive series of prehistoric life illustrations.&lt;ref name="paul1" /&gt; Burian entered the world of prehistoric illustration in the early 1930s with illustrations for fictional books set in various prehistoric times by amateur [[archaeology|archaeologist]] [[Eduard Štorch]]. These illustrations brought him to the attention of paleontologist [[Josef Augusta (paleontologist)|Josef Augusta]], with whom Burian worked in cooperation from 1935 until Augusta's death in 1968.&lt;ref name="Hochmanová-Burianová"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hochmanová-Burianová|first1=Eva|title=Zdeněk Burian - pravěk a dobrodružství (rodinné vzpomínky)|date=1991|publisher=Magnet-Press|location=Prague|isbn=80-85434-28-8|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collaboration led ultimately to the launching of Burian's career in paleoart.&lt;ref name=Lescaze /&gt;
[[Image:Proav16 large.jpg|thumb|right|Gerhard Heilmann's hypothesized bird ancestor "Proavis" (1916)]]
Some authors have remarked on a darker, more sinister feel to his paleoart than that of his contemporaries, speculating that this style was informed by Burian's experience producing artwork in his native Czechoslovakia during World War II and, afterwards, under Soviet control. His depictions of suffering, death, and the harsh realities of survival that emerged as themes in his paleoart were unique at the time. Original Burian paintings are on exhibit at the [[Dvůr Králové Zoo]], the [[National Museum (Prague)]] and at the Anthropos Museum in [[Brno]].&lt;ref name=Lescaze /&gt; In 2017, the first valid Czech dinosaur was named ''[[Burianosaurus|Burianosaurus augustai]]'' in honor of both Burian and Josef Augusta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madzia|first1=Daniel|last2=Boyd|first2=Clint A.|last3=Mazuch|first3=Martin|title=A basal ornithopod dinosaur from the Cenomanian of the Czech Republic|journal=Journal of Systematic Palaeontology|date=2017|pages=1–13|doi=10.1080/14772019.2017.1371258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Charles Knight, Rudolph Zallinger and Zdeněk Burian dominated the landscape of "classic" scientific paleoart in the first half of the 20th century, they were far from the only paleoartists working at this time. German landscape painter [[Heinrich Harder]] was illustrating natural history articles, including a series accompanying articles by science writer [[Wilhelm Bölsche]] on earth history for ''[[Die Gartenlaube]]'', a weekly magazine, in 1906 and 1908. He also worked with Bölsche to illustrate 60 dinosaur and other prehistoric animal collecting cards for the Reichardt Cocoa Company, titled "Tiere der Urwelt" ("Animals of the Prehistoric World").&lt;ref name=Lescaze /&gt; One of Harder's contemporaries, Danish paleontologist [[Gerhard Heilmann]], produced a large number of sketches and ink drawings related to ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' and [[evolution of birds|avian evolution]], culminating in his lavishly illustrated and controversial treatise ''[[The Origin of Birds (book)|The Origin of Birds]]'', published in 1926.&lt;ref name=Lescaze /&gt;

===The Dinosaur Renaissance (1970–2010)===
While these artists' style and their artistic mastery of beauty and composition are still lauded today, this classic depiction of dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals remained the status quo until the 1960s, when a minor scientific revolution began changing the perceptions of dinosaurs as tail-dragging, sluggish animals to active, alert creatures.&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt; This reformation took place following the 1964 discovery of ''[[Deinonychus]]'' by paleontologist [[John Ostrom]]. Ostrom's description of this nearly-complete birdlike dinosaur, published in 1969, challenged the presupposition of dinosaurs as cold-blooded, slow-moving reptiles, instead finding that many of these animals were likely reminiscent of birds, not just in evolutionary history and classification but in appearance and behavior as well. This idea had been advanced before, most notably by 1800s English biologist [[Thomas Huxley]] about the link between dinosaurs, modern birds, and the then-newly discovered ''[[Archaeopteryx]]''. With the discovery and description of ''Deinonychus'', however, Ostrom had laid out the strongest evidence yet of the close link between birds and dinosaurs. The artistic reconstructions of ''Deinonychus'' by his student, [[Robert Bakker]], remain iconic of what came to be known as the Dinosaur Renaissance.&lt;ref name=White1 /&gt;

Bakker's influence during this period on then-fledgling paleoartists, such as [[Gregory S. Paul]], as well as on public consciousness brought about a paradigm shift in how dinosaurs were perceived by artist, scientist and layman alike. The science and public understanding of dinosaur biology became charged by Bakker's innovative and often controversial ideas and portrayals, including the idea that dinosaurs were in fact [[homeothermy|warm-blooded]] animals like mammals and birds. Bakker's drawings of ''Deinonychus'' and other dinosaurs depicted the animals leaping, running, and charging, and his novel artistic output was accompanied by his writings on paleobiology, with his influential and well-known book ''[[The Dinosaur Heresies]]'', published in 1986, now regarded as a classic.&lt;ref name="bakker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakker|first= R. T.|title=The Dinosaur Heresies|year=1986|publisher=William Morrow|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; American scientist-artist Gregory Paul, working originally as Bakker's student in the 1970s, became one of the leading illustrators of prehistoric reptiles in the 1980s and has been described by some authors as the paleoartist who may "define modern paleoart more than any other" (Witton, p. 32). Paul is notable for his 'rigorous' approach to paleoartistic restorations, including his multi-view skeletal reconstructions, evidence-driven studies of musculature and soft tissue, and his attention to biomechanics to ensure realistic poses and gaits of his artistic subjects. The artistic innovation that Paul brought to the field of paleoart is to prioritize detail over atmosphere, leading to some criticism of his work as being 'flat' or lacking in depth, but also to imbue dinosaur depictions with a greater variety of naturalistic coloration and patterns, whereas most dinosaur coloration in artworks beforehand had been fairly drab and uniform.&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt;
[[Image:Tyrannosaurs Rex cast mount, Denver Museum of Nature and Science, Denver, Colorado, USA, 2016.jpg|thumb|right|Cast of ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' specimen AMNH 5027 mounted in a "leaping posture" by Robert Bakker at the [[Denver Museum of Nature and Science]]]]
Ostrom, Bakker and Paul changed the landscape of depictions of prehistoric animals in science and popular culture alike throughout the 1970s, '80s and '90s. Their influence affected the presentation of museum displays throughout the world and eventually found its way into popular culture, with the climax of this period perhaps best marked by the 1990 novel and 1993 film ''[[Jurassic Park]]''.&lt;ref name=White1 /&gt; Paul in particular helped set the stage for the next wave of paleoaristry, and from the 1970s to the end of the twentieth century, paleoartists working from the 'rigorous' approach included [[Doug Henderson (artist)|Douglas Henderson]], Mark Hallett, [[Michael Skrepnick]], [[William Stout]], [[Eleanor Kish|Ely Kish]], [[Luis Rey]], [[John Gurche]], Bob Walters, and others, including an expanding body of sculpting work led by artists such as [[Brian Cooley]], [[Stephen Czerkas]], and Dave Thomas.&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="paul1" /&gt;  Many of these artists developed unique and lucrative stylistic niches without sacrificing their rigorous approach, such as Douglas Henderson's detailed and atmospheric landscapes, and Luis Rey's brightly-colored, 'extreme' depictions.&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt; The "Renaissance" movement so revolutionized paleoart that even the last works of Burian, a master of the "classic" age, were thought to be influenced by the newfangled preference for active, dynamic, exciting depictions of dinosaurs.&lt;ref name="paul1" /&gt;

This movement was working in parallel with great strides in the scientific progress of vertebrate paleontology that were occurring during this time. Precision in anatomy and artistic reconstruction was aided by an increasingly detailed and sophisticated understanding of these extinct animals through new discoveries and interpretations that pushed paleoart into more objective territory with respect to accuracy.&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt; For example, the feathered dinosaur revolution, facilitated by unprecedented discoveries in the [[Liaoning]] province of northern [[China]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s, was perhaps foreseen by artist Sarah Landry, who drew the first [[feathered dinosaur]] for Bakker's seminal ''Scientific American'' article in 1975. One of the first major shows of dinosaur art was published in 1986 by Sylvia Czerkas, along with the accompanying volume ''Dinosaurs Past and Present''.&lt;ref name="paul1" /&gt;

===Modern (and post-modern) paleoart (2010–present)===
[[File:Deinonychus-antirrhopus_jconway.jpg|thumb|right|Birdlike illustration of feathered ''Deinonychus'' by John Conway, 2006]]
Although various authors are in agreement about the events that caused the beginning of the Dinosaur Renaissance, the transition to the modern age of paleoart has been more gradual, with differing attitudes about what typifies the demarcation. Gregory Paul's high-fidelity [[archosaur]] skeletal reconstructions provided a basis for ushering in the modern age of paleoart, which is perhaps best characterized by adding speculative flair to the rigorous, anatomically-conscious approach popularized by the Dinosaur Renaissance. Novel advances in paleontology, such as new feathered dinosaur discoveries and the various color studies of dinosaur integument that began around 2010, have become representative of paleoart after the turn of the millennium.&lt;ref name="terakado"&gt;{{cite book|last=Terakado |first=Kazuo|title=The Art of the Dinosaur: Illustrations by the Top Paleoartists in the World|publisher=PIE International|year=2017|isbn13=978-4756249227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witton (2018) characterizes the modern movement with the rise of [[digital art]], as well as the establishment of an internet community that would enabled paleoartists and enthusiasts to network, share digitized and [[open access]] scientific resources, and to build a global community that was unprecedented until the first decade of the twenty-first century. The continuum of work leading from the themes and advances that began in the Dinosaur Renaissance to the production of modern paleoart is showcased in several books that were published post-2010, such as [[Steve White (comics)|Steve White]]'s ''Dinosaur Art: The World's Greatest Paleoart'' (2012) and its "sequel", ''Dinosaur Art II: The Cutting Edge of Paleoart'' (2017).&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt;
[[File:Arambourgiania_philadelphiae.png|thumb|left|Pair of [[azhdarchid]] pterosaurs ''[[Arambourgiania]]'', by Mark Witton, 2017]]
Although this transition was gradual, authors such have Witton have described a salient cultural phenomenon that came about largely as a consequence of this increased connectivity and access to paleoart brought by the digital age. The saturation of paleoart with established and overused heuristics, many of which had been established by paleoartists working in the height of the revolution that came before, led to an increased awareness and criticism of the repetitive and unimaginative use of ideas that were, by the first decade of the 21st century, lacking in novelty. This observation led to a movement characterized by the idea that prehistoric animals could be shown in artworks engaging in a greater range of behaviors, habitats, styles, compositions, and interpretations of life appearance than had been imagined in paleoart up to that point, but without violating the principles of anatomical and scientific rigor that had been established by the paleoart revolution that came before. These ideas were formalized in a 2012 book by paleoartists [[John Conway (palaeoartist)|John Conway]] and Memo Koseman, along with paleontologist [[Darren Naish]], called ''[[All Yesterdays]]: Unique and Speculative Views of Dinosaurs and Other Prehistoric Animals''. This book and its associated minor paradigm shift, commonly referred to as the "All Yesterdays" movement, argued that it was better to employ scientifically rigorous "reasoned speculation" to produce a greater range of speculative, but plausible, reconstructions of prehistoric animals. Conway et al. argued that the range of appearances and behaviors depicted in paleoart had only managed to capture a very narrow range of what's plausible, based on the limited data available, and that artistic approaches to these depictions had become "overly steeped in tradition" (Witton, p. 36).&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt; For example, ''All Yesterdays'' examines the small, four-winged [[dromaeosaur]] ''[[Microraptor]]'' in this context. This dinosaur, described in 2003, has been depicted by countless paleoartists as a "strange, dragon-like feathered glider with a reptilian face" (Conway et al., page 64). Conway's illustration of ''Microraptor'' in ''All Yesterdays'' attempts to restore the animal "from scratch" without influence from these popular reconstructions, instead depicting it as a naturalistic, birdlike animal perched at its nest.&lt;ref name=AY&gt;{{Cite book | last1= Conway | first1=John | last2= Kosemen | first2=C.M. | last3= Naish | first3=Darren |title=All Yesterdays|year=2012 |publisher=Irregular Books |location=London |isbn13=978-1291177121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the importance of the "All Yesterdays" movement in hindsight, the book itself argued that the modern conceptualization of paleoart was based on anatomically rigorous restorations that came alongside and subsequent to Paul, including those who experimented with these principles outside of archosaurs. For example, artists that pioneered anatomically rigorous reconstructions of fossil [[hominids]], like [[Jay Matternes]] and [[Alfons and Adrie Kennis]], as well fossil [[mammal]] paleoartist [[Mauricio Antón]], were lauded by Conway et al. as seminal influences in the new culture of paleoart. Other modern paleoartists of the "anatomically rigorous" and "All Yesterdays" movement include [[Jason Brougham]], Mark Hallett, [[Scott Hartman]], [[Bob Nicholls]], [[Emily Willoughby]] and [[Mark P. Witton]].&lt;ref name=AY /&gt; Other authors write in agreement that the modern paleoart movement incorporates an element of "challenging tropes and the status quo" and that paleoart has "entered its experimental phase" as of the dawn of the 21st century (Switek, 2017).&lt;ref name="white2"&gt;{{cite book|last = White | first = Steve | title = Dinosaur Art II: The Cutting Edge of Paleoart | publisher = Titan Books | pages =  | date = 2017 | isbn = 978-1785653988}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2013 study found that older paleoart was still influential in popular culture long after new discoveries made them obsolete. This was explained as [[cultural inertia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = Robert M. | last2 = Duggan-Haas | first2 = Don | last3 = Allmon | first3 = Warren D. | title = The posture of ''Tyrannosaurus rex'': Why do student views lag behind the science? | doi = 10.5408/11-259.1 | journal = Journal of Geoscience Education | volume = 61 | pages = 145–160 | year = 2013|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1164225.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=July 28, 2018 | bibcode = 2013JGeEd..61..145R }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 paper, Mark Witton, Darren Naish, and John Conway outlined the historical significance of paleoart, and criticized the over-reliance on clichés and the "culture of copying" they saw to be problematic in the field at the time.&lt;ref name="WNC"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Witton |first1=Mark P. |last2=Naish |first2=Darren |last3=Conway |first3=John |year=2014|title=State of the palaeoart|journal=Palaeontologia Electronica |volume=17|issue=3|pages=5E|doi=10.26879/145|url=https://palaeo-electronica.org/content/pdfs/comment_palaeoart.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency to copy "[[meme]]s" established and proliferated by others in the field is thought to have been a stimulus for the "All Yesterdays" movement of injecting originality back into paleoart.&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt;

==Recognition==
Since 1999, the [[Society of Vertebrate Paleontology]] has awarded the [[John J. Lanzendorf]] [[PaleoArt Prize]] for achievement in the field. The society says that paleoart "is one of the most important vehicles for communicating discoveries and data among paleontologists, and is critical to promulgating vertebrate paleontology across disciplines and to lay audiences".&lt;ref name=svp /&gt; The SVP is also the site of the occasional/annual "PaleoArt Poster Exhibit", a [[Juried (competition)|juried]] poster show at the opening reception of the annual SVP meetings.

Paleoart has enjoyed increasing exposure in globally recognized contests and exhibits. The [[Museu da Lourinhã]] organizes the annual International Dinosaur Illustration Contest&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museulourinha.org/CIID.htm International Dinosaur Illustration Contest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206213816/http://museulourinha.org/CIID.htm |date=2009-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for promoting the art of dinosaur and other fossils. In fall of 2018, the [[New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science]] of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], displayed a juried show of paleoart called "Picturing the Past".&lt;ref name="NM"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brummett|first1=Chad|title='Picturing the Past' Explores Paleo-Art|url=https://www.krqe.com/fox-new-mexico/living/-picturing-the-past-explores-paleo-art/1581240397|work=KRQE: Fox New Mexico|date=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This show includes 87 works by 46 paleoartists from 15 countries, and features one of the largest and most diverse collections of prehistoric animals, settings, themes and styles. Its opening was timed to coincide with the 2018 conference of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in October, and is scheduled to run until January 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pickrell|first=John|title=How dinosaurs are brought back to life—through art|publisher=National Geographic|date=16 November 2018|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2018/11/how-dinosaurs-are-brought-back-to-life-through-art-paleontology/|accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to contests and art exhibitions, paleoart continues to play a significant role in public understanding of paleontology in a variety of ways. In 2007, [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] released a lesson plan on paleoart for children of grades 3 to 5 that uses paleoart as a way to introduce children to paleontology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paleo Artists: Bringing Dinosaurs to Life! A Grade 3–5 Unit of Study|publisher=The Children's Museum of Indianapolis|url=https://www.childrensmuseum.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Educators/3-5_PaleoArtists_UOS.pdf|date=2007|accessdate = 17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paleontological-themed merchandise has been around since at least the mid-1800s, but the popularity of anatomically-accurate and paleoart-based merchandise is relatively novel, such as Rebecca Groom's highly accurate plush toy reconstructions of extinct animals.&lt;ref name="witton2" /&gt;

The only surviving original piece of the '''Polish Crown Jewels''' from the time of the  [[Piast dynasty]] is the ceremonial [[sword]] – [[Szczerbiec]]. It is currently on display along with other preserved royal items at the [[Wawel Castle|Wawel Royal Castle Museum]] in [[Kraków]].

Several royal crowns were made, including several during the 16th Century, a "[[Hungarian Crown]]", a "Swedish Crown" used by the Vasa kings, and others that were subsequently lost or destroyed. The crown regalia used by the [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxon]] kings, and some remainders of older [[Polish monarchs]] which were appropriated by king [[Augustus II the Strong|Augustus II]], also the [[Elector of Saxony]]; like a cup of Queen [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]] so-called ''roztruchan'', and the magnificent scale armour, so-called ''karacena'', of King [[John III Sobieski]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilanow-palac.pl/jan_iii_sobieski_s_karacena.html Jan III Sobieski's Karacena] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230232/http://www.wilanow-palac.pl/jan_iii_sobieski_s_karacena.html |date=March 3, 2016 }} at the Wilanów Palace Museum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |author = Hanna Widacka |url = http://www.wilanow-palac.art.pl/index.php?enc=344 |format= |title = Karacena Jana III Sobieskiego |work = www.wilanow-palac.art.pl |publisher =  |pages =  |page =  |date = |accessdate = 2009-02-16|language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.krakow2000.pl/biuletyn/biuletyn_33/biuletyn_4.html |title=Kultura artystyczna dworu królewskiego i katedry |work=www.krakow2000.pl |publisher= |pages= |page= |date= |accessdate=2009-02-16 |language=pl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031124100235/http://www.krakow2000.pl/biuletyn/biuletyn_33/biuletyn_4.html |archivedate=November 24, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Lileyko Jerzy | coauthors = | title = Vademecum Zamku Warszawskiego (Vademecum of the Royal Castle in Warsaw)| year = 1980 | editor =  | page =129| pages = | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher = | location = | isbn = 83-223-1818-9 | url = | format = | accessdate = |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt; are today on display in the [[Grünes Gewölbe]] and the [[Dresden Armory|Rüstkammer]] in [[Dresden]], Germany.

==History==
[[File:Maurycy.jpg|thumb|upright|right|90px|Polish replica of the [[Holy Lance]], [[Wawel Cathedral]] Treasury]]
[[File:Korona Boleslawa Chrobrego.jpg|thumb|left|[[Crown of Bolesław I the Brave]]]]
In AD 1000, during his pilgrimage to the tomb of [[Adalbert of Prague|Saint Adalbert]] in [[Gniezno]], the capital of Poland until about 1040, Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] officially recognized Duke [[Bolesław I Chrobry|Bolesław I the Brave]] as King of Poland (see [[Congress of Gniezno]]), crowning him and presenting him with a replica of the [[Holy Lance]], also known as [[Saint Maurice]]'s Spear.&lt;ref name="lileyko1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lileyko|1987|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[relic]], together with the ''vexillum'' attached to it, was probably the first insignia of the nascent [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]], a symbol of King Bolesław's rule, and of his allegiance to the Emperor.&lt;ref name="lileyko1" /&gt; It remains unknown what images, if any, were painted or embroidered on the ''vexillum''.&lt;ref name="lileyko1" /&gt;

Starting from 1320 the regalia of the Polish kings were kept in the treasury of the [[Wawel Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="rozek1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rożek|1987|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1370 [[Louis I of Hungary]] decided to transfer the Polish regalia to [[Hungary]] and they were returned in 1412 to Andrzej of [[Rożnów, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Rożnów]] embassy by Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]].&lt;ref name="rozek1" /&gt; During the reign of the [[Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellons]] the regalia were moved from the cathedral to the [[Wawel Castle]] and placed in the specially prepared Crown Treasury. In the 17th century they were repeatedly brought to [[Warsaw]] for the coronations of the [[List of Polish consorts|Polish Queens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rożek|1987|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]] in 1655, the royal insignia were evacuated from the castle by [[Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski]], Grand Marshal of the Crown and hidden in the old castle in [[Stará Ľubovňa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rożek|1987|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were stored there until 1661. In 1703 during the [[Great Northern War]] they were hidden again, first in [[Silesia]], then in [[Moravia]]. During the double election of 1733, the regalia were stolen by the follower of [[Stanisław Leszczyński|Stanisław I Leszczyński]], [[Franciszek Maksymilian Ossoliński]], Grand Treasurer of the Crown, who concealed them in the [[Holy Cross Church, Warsaw|Holy Cross Church]] in Warsaw.&lt;ref name="rozek3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rożek|1987|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1734, however, they were recovered from the hideout and deposited in the [[Jasna Góra Monastery]], where they remained till 1736.&lt;ref name="rozek1" /&gt; In 1764, with the consent of the [[Sejm]], the royal insignia were transported to Warsaw for the coronation of King [[Stanisław II August]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rożek|1987|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later returned to the Wawel Castle, where they were kept till the [[Third Partition of Poland]] in 1795.

On 15 June 1794 the [[Prussian Army]] entered Kraków and captured Wawel Castle, subsequently turning it into a fortress. Shortly thereafter, the city commandant, general Leopold von Reuts began a correspondence with [[Berlin]] on the fate of furnishings of the Polish kings' residence.&lt;ref name="kradziez"&gt;{{cite web|author = |url = http://www.replikiregaliowpl.com/kradziez.html|title = Kradzież i zniszczenie|work = www.replikiregaliowpl.com|publisher = |pages = |page = |date = |accessdate = 2010-10-30|language = pl|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110715174236/http://www.replikiregaliowpl.com/kradziez.html|archive-date = 2011-07-15|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the greatest secrecy, by order of king [[Frederick William II of Prussia]], he was commanded to transfer the content of the Crown Treasury to the Secret Councillor Anton Ludwig von Hoym, who was to secure its transport via [[Silesia]] to Berlin.&lt;ref name="kradziez" /&gt; The locksmith brought by the Prussians broke the locks of the treasury and then opened all the boxes.&lt;ref name="kradziez" /&gt; The valuables were transported in 1794 and found their place in the collection of the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollerns]] in Berlin.&lt;ref name="kradziez" /&gt;

According to an inventory of the State Treasury at the [[Wawel]] performed in 1633 by the [[Jerzy Ossoliński]], [[Kanclerz|Great Crown Chancellor]] the ''Crown Regalia'' of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (kept in five chests) consisted of:

* the so-called "[[Queens Crown]]" made for [[Hedwig of Kalisz|Jadwiga of Kalisz]]
* the so-called "[[Hungarian Crown]]" made for [[John II Sigismund Zápolya]] according to [[Crown of Saint Stephen]]
* the so-called "[[Homagial Crown|''Homagial'' Crown]]" for receiving [[Commendation ceremony|homage]]s, made for [[Jogaila|Władysław II Jagiełło]]
* the so-called "[[Funeral Crown|''Funebralis'' Crown]]" intended for funeral ceremonies of the Polish monarchs, made for [[Stephen Báthory of Poland|Stephen Báthory]]

* [[Szczerbiec]], the [[coronation]] [[sword]] that was used in crowning ceremonies of most kings of Poland
* [[Grunwald Swords]], two [[Teutonic Order]] swords received at the [[Battle of Grunwald]] by King [[Jogaila|Władysław Jagiełło]]
* the sword of [[Bolesław the Bold]]
* the sword of [[Sigismund I the Old]]

Also a private treasury of the [[House of Vasa|Vasa]]s (kept at the [[Royal Castle in Warsaw]]) consisted of:
* the "[[Swedish Crown]]" made for King [[Sigismund II Augustus]]
* the "[[Muscovy Crown]]" made in about 1610 for Prince Władysław Vasa's coronation as a Tsar of Russia
* a silver [[Coat of arms of Poland|White Eagle]] heraldic base for the royal crown (pure silver, partly gilded, 89&amp;nbsp;cm heigh); the eagle was created for King [[John II Casimir]] in [[Augsburg]] by Abraham Drentwett and Heinrich Mannlich in about 1666; presented in the times of a military weakness of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth after the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]] and lost war against the [[Ottoman Empire]] to Tsar of Russia by King [[Michael Korybut Wiśniowiecki|Michael Korybut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |author = Barry Shifman |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_4_160/ai_79030147/pg_5 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080105125729/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_4_160/ai_79030147/pg_5 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 2008-01-05 |format= |title = Gifts to the czars |work = findarticles.com |publisher = Magazine Antiques |pages =  |page =  |date = October 2001 |accessdate = 2009-02-16}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1697 a [[Freiburg]] goldsmith Johann Friedrich Klemm executed a replacement for the regalia, known as the [[Crown of Augustus II the Strong]] and intended for his coronation as a King of Poland.&lt;ref name="rozek2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rożek|1987|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was never used however, because two monks broke into the State Treasury in the Wawel Castle and stole the original regalia.&lt;ref name="rozek2" /&gt; The Augustus II Crown is kept in the Dresden Armory.&lt;ref name="rozek2" /&gt;

All of the original crown regalia were looted by the Prussians (except for the "Muscovy Crown") in 1795 after the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]] of the Commonwealth and destroyed on the order of [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] in March 1809 (except for the Szczerbiec).&lt;ref name="crowns_angelfire" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |author =  |url = http://www.wawel.krakow.pl/en/index.php?op=8,1,5 |format= |title = Crown Treasury and Armoury |work = www.wawel.krakow.pl |publisher = |pages =  |page =  |date = |accessdate = 2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 Polish Government purchased the [[silver]] regalia of King [[Augustus III]] and Queen [[Maria Josepha]] in [[Vienna]] for $35,000 (175,000 zł). It consisted of two [[Crown (headgear)|crown]]s, two [[sceptre]]s and two [[globus cruciger|orb]]s made in about 1733. The original ''Crown Regalia'' were hidden by Franciszek Maksymilian Ossoliński during the [[War of the Polish Succession]].&lt;ref name="lileyko2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lileyko|1987|pp=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jewels were exhibited in [[Warsaw]] until 1939 and in 1940 they were stolen by German forces.&lt;ref name="lileyko2" /&gt; Later they were found by the Soviet troops in [[Germany]] and sent to the [[USSR]] where they remained until 1960, when they were returned to Poland.&lt;ref name="lileyko2" /&gt; Today they are deposited in the [[National Museum in Warsaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Karol Estreicher | coauthors = | title = The Mystery of the Polish Crown Jewels | year = 1945 | editor = | page = 25| chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher = Alliance Press Limited | location = | isbn = | url = | format = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:William Hogarth 017.jpg|thumb|275px|right|''Scene from Shakespeare's The Tempest'' by Hogarth; Circa 1735]]

'''''Scene from Shakespeare's The Tempest''''', also known as '''''Ferdinand courting Miranda''''' ({{circa|1736–1738}}) is an oil painting by the English painter [[William Hogarth]].{{sfn|Paulson|1992|p=200}} It has been displayed at [[Nostell Priory]] since 1766, and was acquired by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] in 2002.  The National Trust claims that it is "the first known painting of a scene from Shakespeare".{{sfn|National Trust Collections|n.d.}}{{sfn|Pask|2013|pp=54–55}}

The painting is a rich and vibrant example of Hogarth's work, painted c.1730-5 as a special project for one of his devoted band of patrons—[[George Parker, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield|The Earl of Macclesfield]]—as part of Hogarth's attempt to found an distinctively British school of history painting. It is thought that Hogarth was hoping that more commissions for similar scenes would come flowing in after painting this scene, but this did not happen.{{sfn|Art Fund|2002}}{{sfn|Tate Britain|n.d.}}

It measures {{convert|80|x|106.5|cm}} and depicts a scene from Act 1 scene ii of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play, ''[[The Tempest]]'', with [[Ferdinand (The Tempest)|Ferdinand]] courting [[Miranda (The Tempest)|Miranda]]. Miranda is depicted sitting on a throne made of shells and coral, distracted and thus spilling from a bowl of milk that she has been feeding to a lamb.  To the left is her father [[Prospero]], and further left is Ferdinand.  The spirit [[Ariel (Shakespeare)|Ariel]] floats above, playing a [[lute]] or [[mandolin]].  To the right is the misshapen monster [[Caliban (character)|Caliban]], with a bat above his head, grimacing and drooling as he stamps on a dove.{{sfn|National Trust Collections|n.d.}}

The painting was bought from the Earl of Macclesfield's widow in 1766 by [[Sir Rowland Winn, 5th Baronet]],{{sfn|National Trust Collections|n.d.}} and was hung on the walls of [[Nostell Priory]], near [[Wakefield]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]] for over two centuries by the [[Winn Baronets]] and then their relatives the [[Baron St Oswald|Barons St Oswald]]. Nostell Priory was acquired by the National Trust in 1953, but the former owners retained most of the contents. When the 6th [[Baron St Oswald]] announced his wish to sell the painting in 2002, it was bought by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], with the whole cost of nearly £300,000 funded with a grant from the [[Art Fund]].{{sfn|National Trust Collections|n.d.}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2002}}

The action of slut-shaming can be considered to be a form of social punishment and is an aspect of [[sexism]]. The social movement falls into the category of [[feminism]]. This raises controversy because [[gender role]]s do have a significant role in the social movement. The topic of slut-shaming sheds light on the social issues that are associated with the double standard. This is because slut-shaming is usually toward girls and women, and boys and men usually do not get slut-shamed. Slut-shaming is common in America because it is such a high-context culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lik|first=Sam|date=2016|title=A Comparison of U.S. and Chinese Profiles on Jack'd, a Mobile Dating App for Men Who Have Sex With Men|url=http://electra.lmu.edu:2070/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=3&amp;sid=deab3d6e-3730-40a9-9b44-e0ca8bfd6023%40pdc-v-sessmgr01|journal=International Journal Of Communication|volume=19328036|pages=106040–6059}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being in a high-context culture, it is easier to be victim blamed.

Researchers from Cornell University found that sentiments similar to slut-shaming appeared in nonsexual, same-sex friendship context as well.&lt;ref name="spr.sagepub.com"/&gt; The researchers had college women read a vignette describing an imaginary female peer, "Joan", then rate their feelings about her personality.&lt;ref name="spr.sagepub.com"/&gt; To one group of women, Joan was described as having two lifetime sexual partners; to another group, she had had twenty partners.&lt;ref name="slate.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hess |first=Amanda |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/06/07/slut_shaming_study_women_discriminate_against_promiscuous_women_but_so_do.html |title=Slut-shaming study: Women discriminate against promiscuous women, but so do men |publisher=Slate.com |date=7 June 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that women—even women who were more promiscuous themselves—rated the Joan with 20 partners as "less competent, emotionally stable, warm, and dominant than the Joan who'd only boasted two".&lt;ref name="spr.sagepub.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slate.com"/&gt;

==Society and culture==
=== History ===
There is no documented date of origin for the term ''slut-shaming''; nor the act of it. Rather, although the act of slut-shaming has existed for centuries, discussion of it has grown out of social and cultural relations and the trespassing of boundaries of what is considered normative and acceptable behavior. [[Second wave of feminism]] contributed significantly to the definition and act of slut-shaming. Tracing back to the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the second [[World War]], men's gender roles were that of the breadwinner. Men made up a majority of the labor force while women were socialized and taught to embrace the cult of domesticity and homemaking.&lt;ref name="Poole"&gt;Poole, E. (2014) Hey girls, did you know? Slut-shaming on the internet needs to stop. University of San Francisco Law Review, 1, pp. 221-260&lt;/ref&gt; Author Emily Poole argues that the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s increased the rate of both [[birth control]] use, as well as rates of [[premarital sex]].&lt;ref name="Poole"/&gt;

=== Modern society ===
Slut-shaming is prevalent on [[social media]] platforms, including the most commonly used: [[YouTube]], [[Instagram]], [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]]. Slut-shaming has occurred on Facebook in controversial exchanges between users that have resulted in convictions to menace, harass and cause offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = This Woman Received Rape Threats for Quoting Drake on Tinder|url = http://mic.com/articles/124646/olivia-melville-was-slut-shamed-and-received-rape-threats-for-quoting-drake-on-her-tinder-profile#.I0vMKyLgT|website = Mic|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/30/how-facebook-troll-came-undone|author = Elle Hunt|date = 30 July 2016|accessdate = 30 July 2016|newspaper = [[The Guardian]]|title = 'What law am I breaking?' How a Facebook troll came undone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported by [[The Pew Research Center]] that the most common targets of harassment on the Internet are often young women. Citing that 50% of young female respondents have been called offensive names and or shamed online. In particular, those who were 18 to 24 years of age, experienced varying amounts of severe harassment at astoundingly high rates. Women who have been stalked online were at 26%, while the targets of online sexual harassment were at 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/10/22/online-harassment/|title=Online Harassment|date=2014-10-22|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Women Studies International Forum'', researcher Jessica Megarry argues that harassment conveyed in a case study of #mencallmethings hashtag found that it was a form of online sexual assault, on specifically Twitter. In this hashtag, women would collectively tweet examples of harassment they have received from men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Megarry|first=Jessica|date=2014|title=Online inclnivity or sexual harassment?

The Slut Walk movement has embraced the slut-shame label and has engaged in an act of resignification. Ringrose et al. call the Slut Walk a "collective movement" where the focus goes back to the perpetrator and no longer rests on the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Ringrose, J. &amp; Renold, E (2011). Slut-shaming, girl power and ‘sexualisation’: thinking through the politics of international slutwalks with teen girls. Gender and Education, 24 (3), 333-343.&lt;/ref&gt; This act of resignification comes from the work of feminist scholar [[Judith Butler]]. In her 1997 work, she argued that labels do not just name and marginalize individuals to particular categories but language also open up an opportunity for resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, J. (1996). Excitable speech: Contemporary scenes of politics. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Krystal Ball characterized the comments of [[Rush Limbaugh]] during the [[Rush Limbaugh–Sandra Fluke controversy]] as follows: "If you are a woman who stands up for your rights, you are a slut and your parents should be ashamed of you and we should all have the right to view your sex tapes online. This type of despicable behavior is part and parcel of a time-worn tradition of Slut-Shaming. When women step out line [sic], they are demeaned and degraded into silence.

Slut-shaming has been used as a form of bullying on social media, with some people using [[revenge porn]]ography tactics to spread intimate photos without consent. In 2012, a California teenager, [[Suicide of Audrie Pott|Audrie Pott]], was sexually assaulted by three boys at a party. She committed suicide eight days after photos of her being assaulted were distributed among her peer group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/30/slut-shaming-teen-girls_n_4178812.html|title = Teen Girls Take A Stand Against Slut Shaming: What It Is, And Why You Should Care|accessdate = |series = Huff Post Teen|website = The Huffington Post|last = Menza|first = Kaitlin|date=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the gang rape of an unconscious sixteen year old girl in Steubenville, Ohio, August 2012, football players spread videos of the assault to other classmates whom some of which posted the videos to Twitter and Instagram. The pictures and video were later removed by authorities, however that did not stop people from hash-tagging "Whore status" or "I have no sympathy for whores" in their tweets. Members of the collective Anonymous reported names of the rapists and classmates who spread the footage to local authorities. They took to the streets and internet requesting help from the community to bring justice to the Jane Doe who was raped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hate Crimes in Cyberspace|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674368293|pages=95–119|jstor=j.ctt7zsws7.7|chapter=Civil Rights Movements, Past and Present}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of The Arts Effect All-Girl Theater Company have developed a play, ''[[Slut: The Play]]'', in which they address the damaging impact of slut-shaming and slut culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lauren-hersh/nyc-girls-challenge-weiner_b_3691859.html |title=NYC Girls Challenge Weiner Campaign: Stop Slut-Shaming |first=Lauren|last=Hersh |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date= 2 August 2013|accessdate=11 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sluttheplay.com/why/ |title=Why Slut — Slut |publisher=Sluttheplay.com |date= |accessdate=11 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326180510/http://sluttheplay.com/why/ |archivedate=26 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creators note that their play "is a call to action – a reminder" that slut-shaming is happening every day, almost everywhere.&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com" /&gt; "Slut" is inspired by real-life experiences of 14- to 17-year-old girls from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com" /&gt; The play was shown at the 2013 New York Fringe Festival.&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shine.yahoo.com/love-sex/teenage-peta-pinup-speaks-out-205112851.html |title=Meet the Teen Star of PETA's Latest Controversy.

In her statement on the production, and of slut-shaming in general, author of ''Slut! Growing Up Female with a Bad Reputation'', [[Leora Tanenbaum]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A teenage girl today is caught in an impossible situation. She has to project a sexy image and embrace, to some extent, a 'slutty' identity. Otherwise, she risks being mocked as an irrelevant prude. But if her peers decide she has crossed an invisible, constantly shifting boundary and has become too 'slutty,' she loses all credibility. Even if she was coerced into sex, her identity and reputation are taken from her. Indeed, the power to tell her own story is wrested from her. The Arts Effect's SLUT written by [[Katie Cappiello]] vividly represents this irrational, harmful, terrible circumstance...This play is the most powerful and authentic representation of the sexual double standard I have ever seen."&lt;ref name="sluttheplay.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After experiencing slut-shaming first-hand, Olivia Melville, Paloma Brierly Newton and approximately a dozen other Australian women founded the organization, Sexual Violence Won’t Be Silenced, on August 25, 2015. The association seeks to raise awareness of cyber-bullying and online sexual violence. The founders also launched a petition to the Australian government, requesting that they better train and educate law enforcement officers on how to prevent and punish violent harassment on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mic.com/articles/124646/olivia-melville-was-slut-shamed-and-received-rape-threats-for-quoting-drake-on-her-tinder-profile#.I0vMKyLgT|title=A Woman Was Slut-Shamed and Received Rape Threats for Quoting Drake on Her Tinder Profile|author=Mic|work=Mic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Among gay and bisexual men==
Gay and bisexual men are also victimized for slut-shaming because of their sexual activity. There has been research supporting that [[LGBT]] students were more likely to be bullied and called sluts than heterosexual students. Researchers discussed how these negative experiences of victimization by peers, friends and strangers can lead to "physical harm, social shaming, and loss of friendships."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Unlike heterosexual people, LGBT people are more likely to learn about [[safe sex]] practices from friends.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} The group most highly at risk of [[HIV]] infection is young gay and bisexual men.{{Citation needed |date=July 2018}} Most of the education that young gay and bisexual men receive about safe sex practices is learned from friends, the Internet, hearsay or trial and error.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crothers|first=Laura|last2=Levinson|first2=E.M.|date=2004-09-01|title=Assessment of bullying: A review of methods and instruments|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280786511_Assessment_of_bullying_A_review_of_methods_and_instruments|journal=Journal of Counseling and Development|volume=82|pages=496–503}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification failed|date=July 2018}}

Criticism of [[non-heterosexual]] men's sexual activity can either be said in a humorous context or not. Judgementalism happens when someone mentions gay men's sexual risk behavior or that they have [[multiple sex partners]]. This implies that their behavior is "slutty" and dirty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDavitt|first=Bryce|last2=Mutchler|first2=Matt G.|date=April 2014|title="Dude, You’re Such a Slut!"

A lot of slut-shaming occurs when non-heterosexual men are in public environments; they may be street-harassed for their sexual orientation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Street harassment includes [[cat-calling]], victim blaming, and slut shaming. Judgmentalism is not a pejorative word compared to women, and slut-shaming may have a positive connotation with men depending on context and relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://monash.rl.talis.com/items/E364B37E-5E83-D602-A4F9-25CDDED28245.html|title=Street Harassment: Current and Promising Avenues for Researchers and Activists {{!}} Monash University|website=monash.rl.talis.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2012/02/10/she_called_me_a_manwhore/|title=She called me a "manwhore"|last=Clark-Flory|first=Tracy|date=9 February 2012|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although health research is often organized by disease categories or organ systems, theoretical development in social epidemiology is typically organized around factors that influence health (i.e., health determinants rather than health outcomes). Many social factors are thought to be relevant for a wide range of health domains. Social epidemiology can therefore address any health outcome, including chronic disease, infectious disease, mental health, and clinical outcomes or disease prognosis. Exposures of interest to social epidemiologists include individual-level measures (e.g., poverty, education, social isolation), contextual factors (e.g., residential segregation or income inequality), and social policies (e.g., policies creating income security or promoting educational access). Analyses that address the independent or synergistic effects of individual or contextual risk factors are often of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9491010 |pmc=1508189 |year=1998 |author1=Diez-Roux |first1=A.

For example, questions of interest to epidemiologists include:{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* Why have racial and economic inequalities in premature mortality persisted for generations even as the specific diseases causing premature death have completely changed?
* Do changes in social policies regulating social safety nets, human capital development, employment, occupational conditions, housing, or residential segregation influence the health of individuals? 
* Do social conditions at specific periods of life, for example early life developmental periods, disproportionately influence later health outcomes compared to exposures at later ages?
* Do adverse experiences such as chronic psychological stress, trauma, racism, or shame influence health and if so, what are the biological mechanisms of these effects?

Social epidemiology draws on methodologies and theoretical frameworks from many disciplines, and research overlaps with several social science fields, most notably [[economics]], [[medical anthropology]], [[medical sociology]], [[health psychology]] and [[medical geography]], as well as many domains of epidemiology.  However, intersecting social science fields often use health and disease in order to explain specifically social phenomenon (such as the growth of lay [[health advocacy]] movements),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7560848 |jstor=2626956 |year=1995 |author1=Brown |first1=P |title=Naming and framing: The social construction of diagnosis and illness |journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior |volume=Spec No |pages=34–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while social epidemiologists generally use social concepts in order to explain patterns of health in the population.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

More recently, the discipline is moving from identifying health inequalities along the social gradient to identifying the policies, programmes and interventions that effectively tackle the observed socioeconomic inequalities in health. Researchers Frank Pega and Ichiro Kawachi from Harvard University have suggested that this may lead to the new discipline of Political Epidemiology, which is more policy-applied in that it identifies effective and cost-effecfive social interventions for government action to improve health equity.&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.06.007"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Politics, policies and population health: a commentary on Mackenbach, Hu and Looman (2013) |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=93 |pages=176–9 |year=2013 |doi= 10.1016/j.socscimed.2013.06.007 |last1=Pega |first1=Frank |last2=Kawachi |first2=Ichiro |last3=Rasanathan |first3=Kumanan  |last4=Lundberg |first4=Olle }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Norse mythology]], the sword belonging to Freyr, a Norse god associated with sunshine, summer and fair weather. Freyr's sword is depicted in Norse mythology as one of the few weapons that is capable of fighting on its own. After Freyr gave up the sword to [[Skírnir]] for the hand of the giantess [[Gerðr]], he will die at [[Ragnarök]] because he didn't have his sword, fighting [[Surtr]] with an antler.


==Norse mythology ==
===''Prose Edda''===
Freyr asks Skírnir to bring Gerðr to him, Skírnir demands his sword from him, and Freyr readily gives it. The loss of Freyr's sword has consequences. According to the ''Prose Edda'', Freyr had to fight [[Beli (Norse giant)|Beli]] without his sword and slew him with an [[antler]]. But the result at [[Ragnarök]], the end of the world, will be much more serious. Freyr is fated to fight the fire-giant [[Surtr]] and since he does not have his sword he will be defeated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/prose/049052.php Brodeur's translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Poetic Edda''===
In Ragnarok the sun shines "from the sword of the gods".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hi.is/~eybjorn/ugm/vsp3.html EB's edition]&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that the sword which Surtr uses to slay Freyr with is his, "the sword of the gods" which Freyr had earlier bargained away for Gerðr. This would add a further layer of tragedy to the myth. [[Sigurður Nordal]] argued for this view but the possibility represented by [[Ursula Dronke]]'s translation that it is a simple coincidence is equally possible.&lt;ref&gt;Völuspá 50–51, [[Ursula Dronke]]'s translation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances in Popular Media and Culture==
In Rick Riordan's [[Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard]], the sword of Freyr possessed by the protagonist is called Sumarbrandr meaning 'summer sword'.

'''''The Power Elite''''' is a 1956 book by [[sociologist]] [[C. Wright Mills]], in which Mills calls attention to the interwoven interests of the leaders of the [[military]], [[corporate]], and [[political]] elements of [[society]] and suggests that the ordinary [[citizen]] is a relatively powerless subject of manipulation by those entities.

==Background==
The book is something of a counterpart of Mills' 1951 work, ''[[White Collar: The American Middle Classes]]'', which examines the then-growing role of [[Middle management|middle managers]] in American society. A main inspiration for the book was [[Franz Leopold Neumann]]'s book ''[[Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism]]'' in 1942, a study of how Nazism came into a position of power in a democratic state like Germany. ''Behemoth'' had a major impact on Mills and he claimed that Behemoth had given him the "tools to grasp and analyse the entire total structure and as a warning of what could happen in a modern capitalist democracy".&lt;ref&gt;C.Wright Mills: ''Power, Politics and People'', (New York, 1963 p.174)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Joint Chiefs of Staff 1949.jpg|thumb|275px|left|The [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], pictured here in 1949, are four of six ruling elites Mills identified.]]
According to Mills, the eponymous "power elite" are those that occupy the dominant positions, in the dominant institutions (military, economic and political) of a dominant country, and their decisions (or lack of decisions) have enormous consequences, not only for the U.S. population but, "the underlying populations of the world." The institutions which they head, Mills posits, are a triumvirate of groups that have succeeded weaker predecessors: (1) "two or three hundred giant corporations" which have replaced the traditional agrarian and craft economy, (2) a strong federal political order that has inherited power from "a decentralized set of several dozen states" and "now enters into each and every cranny of the social structure," and (3) the military establishment, formerly an object of "distrust fed by state militia," but now an entity with "all the grim and clumsy efficiency of a sprawling bureaucratic domain."

Importantly, and in distinction from modern American [[conspiracy theory]], Mills explains that the elite themselves may not be aware of their status as an elite, noting that "often they are uncertain about their roles" and "without conscious effort, they absorb the aspiration to be ... The Ones Who Decide." Nonetheless, he sees them as a quasi-hereditary caste. The members of the power elite, according to Mills, often enter into positions of societal prominence through educations obtained at [[east coast of the United States|eastern]] establishment universities like [[Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and [[Yale]]. But, Mills notes, "Harvard or Yale or Princeton is not enough ... the point is not Harvard, but which Harvard?" Mills identifies two classes of [[Ivy League]] alumni, those initiated into an upper echelon [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternity]] or [[final club]], such as [[Porcellian]] and [[Fly Club]], and those who are not. Those so initiated, Mills continues, receive their invitations based on social links first established in elite private [[University-preparatory school#United States|preparatory academies]], where they are enrolled as part of antebellum family traditions. In this manner, the mantle of the elite generally passes through families. 
[[File:Joseph and Rose Kennedy 1940.JPG|thumb|275px|right|Historically prominent families, such as the Kennedy family, form the "Metropolitan 400." Shown here are Rose and Joseph Kennedy in 1940.]]
The resulting elites, who control the three dominant institutions (military, economy and political system) can be generally grouped into one of six types, according to Mills: 
* the "Metropolitan 400" - members of historically notable local families in the principal American cities, generally represented on the [[Social Register]]
* "Celebrities" - prominent entertainers and media personalities
* the "Chief Executives" - presidents and CEOs of the most important companies within each industrial sector

Mills formulated a very short summary of his book: "Who, after all, runs America? No one runs it altogether, but in so far as any group does, the power elite."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sociological Imagination|last=Mills|first=C. Wright|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and criticism==
Commenting on ''The Power Elite'', [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]] derisively said, "I look forward to the time when Mr. Mills hands back his prophet's robes and settles down to being a sociologist again."&lt;ref name="NYTMAY"&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Summers |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Deciders |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/books/review/14summers.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |work=New York Times |publisher= |date=14 May 2006 |accessdate=14 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Berle]] noted the book contained "an uncomfortable degree of truth", but Mills presented "an angry cartoon, not a serious picture".&lt;ref name="NYTMAY" /&gt;  [[Dennis Wrong]] described ''The Power Elite'' as "an uneven blend of journalism, sociology, and moral indignation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dennis |last=Wrong |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Power Elite, by C. Wright Mills |url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/the-power-elite-by-c-wright-mills/ |work=Commentary Magazine |publisher= |date=September 1956 |accessdate=14 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of the book in the ''Louisiana Law Review'' bemoaned that the "practical danger of Mr. Mills' pessimistic interpretation of the current situation is that his readers will concentrate on answering his prejudicial assertions rather than ponder the results of his really formidable research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Calvin |last=Woodard |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=THE POWER ELITE, by C. Wright Mills |url=http://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2448&amp;context=lalrev |work=Louisiana Law Review |publisher= |date=December 1956 |accessdate=14 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, consideration of the book has become moderately more favorable over time. In 2006, [[G. William Domhoff]] wrote, "Mills looks even better than he did 50 years ago".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=G. William|last=Domhoff|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mills's The Power Elite, 50 Years Later |work=Contemporary Sociology |publisher= |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mills' biographer, John Summers, admitted that ''The Power Elite'' was "vulnerable to the charge of conspiracy-mongering" but declared that its historical value "seems assured".&lt;ref name="NYTMAY"/&gt; In a purposeful extension of Mills' Power Elite, his proposed International System, and Comparative Sociology, Muhammed Asadi (2012) suggests that the modern World System is highly militarized and a counterpart of the US permanent war economy where a global division of labor based on military Keynesian stabilization exists concomitant with economic accumulation. He calls these countries, militarized states, whose economic growth stabilizes the World System run by the Command States (counterpart to Wallerstein's Core but includes military and political domination in addition to financial and trade domination) just like military spending in the US stabilizes the US economy. Militarization and wars are therefore encouraged by the Command States and facilitated by them just as suggested by Mills in The Causes of World War Three (1958), the preparation for war leads to wars.&lt;ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

Episode 5 of the [[Netflix]] [[TV series]] ''[[Mindhunter (TV series)|Mindhunter]]'' contains a scene in which one of the main characters, a sociology PhD student Deborah "Debbie" Mitford, writes a paper on [[C. Wright Mills]]'s ''The Power Elite''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3449">'''Theodor August Christian Sørensen''' (25 May 1873 – 2 September 1959) was a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] missionary known for his work in [[Tibet]].

He was born in [[Kristiansand]] as the son of a carpenter. He experienced a religious revival in 1891, and joined the [[Salvation Army]]. From 1892 to 1894 he attended a bible school in the [[United Kingdom]]. He then went to [[British India]] with the Tibetan Pioneer Mission, settled near the [[Tibet]]an border and undertook studies of its [[Standard Tibetan|language]] and religions together with [[Edvard Amundsen]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaul, H. K., &amp; Hari Krishen Kaul. 1997. ''Travellers' India: An Anthology''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. lx.&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to travel within Tibet, but as this was rejected by the British colonial power, he moved to [[Chengdu]], [[Late Imperial China|Chinese Empire]] in 1896.&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Theo Sørensen|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Per|last=Kværne|authorlink=Per Kværne|volume=|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Theo_S%C3%B8rensen/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here he studied the [[Chinese language]], and proclaimed that learning Chinese was a "delight" compared to Tibetan.&lt;ref name=uniforum&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uniforum.uio.no/nyheter/2009/05/en-skatt-fra-det-fjerne-osten.html|title=En skatt fra det fjerne østen|last=Tidemann|first=Grethe|date=7 May 2009|work=Uniforum|language=Norwegian|accessdate=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1899 to 1923 he lived and worked for the [[China Inland Mission]] in [[Kangding]], [[Sichuan]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

He did not particularly succeed as a missionary, but conducted several longer travels in Eastern Tibet and became known for collecting Tibetan scripture. Among others, he found a series of written sheets in the ruins of a monastery. Upon returning to Norway in 1923, he donated a 314-volume collection of [[Tibetan Buddhist canon]] to the [[University of Oslo|University of Kristiania]]. The texts particularly pertained to [[Bön]] and [[Nyingma]] schools of Tibetan Buddhism.&lt;ref name=uniforum/&gt;

For his contribution, Sørensen was declared a Fellow of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Anthropological Institute]] in 1922 and the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in 1923. In 1953 he was proclaimed Knight, First Class of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]]. He lived the rest of his life in Norway, except for the years 1925 to 1936 which he spent in [[Beijing|Peking]]. He had married fellow missionary Cecilie "Cissi" Rasmussen (1870–1955) in March 1904 in [[Leshan]]. Also, he rejoined the [[Church of Norway]] in 1924. He died in September 1959 in Kristiansand.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; In 2009, his grandniece donated another set of scriptures to the University of Oslo.&lt;ref name=uniforum/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16067">The '''theology of religions''' is the branch of [[theology]] (mostly represented by [[Christian theology|Christian]], [[Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Islam]]ic and [[Judaism|Jewish]] theology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bronk |first=Andrzej |title=Podstawy nauk o religii |others=Antoni Fetkowski (ed.) |publisher=Wydawnictwo Towarzystwa Naukowego KUL |location=Lublin |year=1996 |pages=129 |chapter=11. Teologia religii |isbn=83-86668-44-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[religious studies]] that attempts to theologically evaluate the phenomena of religions. Three important schools within Christian part of this field are pluralism, inclusivism, and exclusivism, which describe the relation of other religious traditions to Christianity and attempt to answer questions about the nature of God and salvation.

==Purpose==
The American theologian [[Langdon Brown Gilkey]] argued that the political situation of the West following [[World War II]] set up a need for Christian thinkers to reconsider the place of other religions specifically because of the changing political world:

:Colonies vanished, Europe disappeared as a major power, other non-western power centers appeared representing other ways of life and other religions. The West no longer ruled the world... Western religion became one among the other world religions.&lt;ref&gt;Gilkey, "Plurality and Its Theological Implications", in ''The Myth of Christian Uniqueness: Toward a Pluralistic Theology of Religions'' (edited by [[John Hick]]), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic Three-Point Model==
The most common model of the view that one takes of other religions has been viewed in a simple, three point model, first articulated by Alan Race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Race |first=Alan |date=1982 |title= Christians and Religious Pluralism: Patterns in the Christian Theology of Religions |location= Maryknoll, NY|publisher=Orbis Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pluralism===
Pluralism is basically the belief that the world religions are true and equally valid in their communication of the truth about God, the world, and salvation. The chief expounder of this view is [[John Hick]] of [[Claremont Graduate School]] in California, who first propounded it in his book ''God and the Universe of Faiths (1973)''. It has been notably criticized in the declaration [[Dominus Iesus]] by Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]].

This is the popular view that all religions lead to the same God and all ways lead to heaven. According to Hick, Christianity is not the one and only way of salvation, but one among several. To a pluralist such as Hick, Christianity is not the absolute, unique, and final way to God. While pluralists assert the validity of all religions, they also deny the finality of all religions. According to Hick, in the evolutionary scheme of things in which at isolated ages and places the early religions are succeeded by higher religions, it is the same message of God that comes distinctly to a particular group but in a different form from the others. Hick challenges the older view that Christ or Christianity must be seen at the center of religions. Rather, he says, God must be seen at the center of religions. This view is also called theo-centrism. The pluralistic contention is that although religions have different outward forms, all have the same source.

To an evangelical Christian, such pluralism only means the abolition of ''kerygmatic'' mission (i.e., the mission of evangelizing the world with the salvific gospel of Jesus Christ).  Pluralism has been criticized for masquerading as Christianity when in fact it is an invasive force that comes from outside of Christianity and imperialistically demands the surrender of Christian distinctiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Alister E. McGrath, "Conclusion," in ''Four Views on Salvation in a Pluralistic World'', ed. Stanley N. Gundry, Dennis L. Okholm, and Timothy R. Phillips (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1996), 205-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pluralists respond that Christian pluralism is not an invasive force at all, but actually arises from tensions within the Christian tradition, through a process of auto-deconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Carroll Smith, "In Defense of a Christian Pluralism," Journal for the Renewal of Religion and Theology 5 (2009), available from http://renewtheology.org/paperCSmith0709.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have pointed out similarities between Hick's theo-centrism and Hindu pluralism as propounded in the &lt;em&gt;Bhagavad Gita&lt;/em&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;By whatsoever way men worship Me, even so do I accept them; for, in all ways, O Partha, men walk in My path" (IV.11)&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, &lt;em&gt;Theology of Religion: Pluralism, Inclusivism, and Exclusivism&lt;/em&gt;, as cited by Imtitoshi Longkumer in "Issues in Mission and Evangelism in a Pluralistic Context: A New Paradigm Inquiry," &lt;em&gt;NCC Review,&lt;/em&gt; Vol. CXXXVII, No.01, Jan-Feb 2017 (Nagpur: National Council of Churches in India, 2017), p.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Another common evangelical criticism of pluralism is that the religions of the world are fundamentally and irreconcilably different.  To value them equally requires a devaluation of propositional truth claims.  It is for this reason that pluralism is often treated as a form of self-defeating relativism, though pluralists generally do not accept this label.  According to John Hick, "Religious pluralism is emphatically not a form of relativism."  Hick considers himself a [[Theological critical realism|critical realist]].&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, "Religious Pluralism and Islam," available from http://www.johnhick.org.uk/article11.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inclusivism===
[[Inclusivism]] is the belief that God is present in non-Christian religions to save adherents through Christ. The inclusivist view has given rise to the concept of the anonymous Christian by which is understood an adherent of a particular religion whom God saves through Christ, but who personally neither knows the Christ of the Bible nor has converted to Biblical Christianity. This position was popularized by the Roman Catholic theologian, [[Karl Rahner]] (b. 1904-d.1984).{{Nonspecific|date=March 2012}}

One important issue that Rahner raises is about the salvation of those who have never had the opportunity to listen to the gospel Jesus Christ. To Rahner, then, people can be saved apart from allegiance to the Christian church. It is God in Christ who reaches out to the individual in his own personal religious history to save him. Rahner used the term ‘anonymous’ to denote people who experience the grace of God in Christ regardless of what religion they belong to. Inclusivism is based on two axioms: the first is that salvation is through Christ alone, the second is that God wills the whole world to be saved.&lt;ref&gt;Based on Acts 4:12 and 1 Timothy 2: 4&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, God saves people through Christ alone; however, he makes this possible through ways that extend to all humanity.

To Rahner, a non-Christian religion is a lawful religion for until its followers have a Christian witness it is a means by which non-Christians gain a right relationship with God. Also, the religion is included in God’s plan of salvation which God has ordained for the communication of His grace.

Inclusivism has a great appeal to people because of its sympathetic approach to religion.

===Exclusivism===
Exclusivism is the theological position that holds to the finality of the Christian faith in Christ. The finality of Christ means that there is no salvation in non-Christian religions. Notable among the exclusivists of the twentieth century are [[Samuel Zwemer]], [[Hendrik Kraemer]], and [[Lesslie Newbigin]].

Based on the Aristotelian concept of truth as one and not many, exclusivists regard all other religious claims as false and invalid since the Christian revelation is accepted as true.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Gnanakan, The Pluralistic Predicament (Bangalore: TBT, 1992), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Exclusivists hold that salvation is through Christ alone. It is through a personal experience of commitment to Christ that one receives assurance of salvation. The non-believers cannot receive such assurance since they are neither aware of the uniqueness of Christ neither do they acknowledge His lordship. The exclusivist begins with the Bible as the source of all knowledge about spirituality and salvation. The Bible is the criterion of all religious truth. The Bible relates the history of redemption, gives a foundation to personal faith, is a guidebook of the Christian community, and speaks about the future of the world that links up all history, life, and service with meaning and purpose. Exclusivism, thus, establishes the uniqueness and identity of Christianity among world religions. Such exclusivism can take either an extremist or a moderate viewpoint. The extremist view regards all non-Christian religions as demonic and enemies of Christian truth.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Brunner &amp; Karl Barth, Natural Theology (London: Geoffrey Bles: The Centenary Press, 1946), pp. 74, 128&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the moderate view sees some non-Christian religions as containing elements whereby a dialogue with them can be initiated. However, all exclusivists in general agree that salvation is exclusively only through Christ and received by a personal commitment to the Lord.

An exclusivist view is inevitable in any dialogue of truth. In fact, neither the pluralist nor the inclusivist could avoid being exclusivist at some point. Truth by nature is exclusive and any claim to truth is exclusive. The only way to deny exclusiveness of Christ is to deny the veracity of the Bible. The exclusivist view sees the exclusiveness of the Bible in its proclamation of Christ as the only way of salvation, though the Bible also speaks of God involved in the history of the nations. Thus, though being very vociferous in his attacks on Hinduism, [[Nehemiah Goreh]] could say that ‘Most erroneous as is the teaching of such books as the ''Bhagvadgita,''  the ''Bhagvata'', etc., yet they teach something of ''ananyabhakti'' (undivided devotedness to God), of ''vairagya'' (giving up the world), of ''namrata'' (humility), of ''ksama'' (forbearance), etc., which enables one to appreciate the precepts of Christianity.’&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Proofs of the Divinity of Our Lord, as cited by R.H.S. Boyd in Indian Christian Theology (Delhi: ISPCK, 1969), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Hendrik Kraemer's exclusivism is based on a skepticism towards claims of similarity between religions: "Every religion is an individisble, and not to be divided". Religion "is not a series of tenets, institutions, practices that can be taken one by one as independent items of religious life".&lt;ref&gt;Hendrik Kraemer, ''The Christian Message in a Non-Christian World'' (1938), p. 40. Cited in {{cite book|author=Tim S. Perry|title=Radical Difference: A Defence of Hendrik Kraemer's Theology of Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5FBFtVH_mOwC&amp;pg=PA115|year=2001|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press|isbn=978-0-88920-377-8|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knitter's Four-Point Model==
A significant expansion of the three point model was proposed by [[Paul F. Knitter]] in his 2002 book ''Introducing Theologies of Religions''. He outlined four possible views or models that one could adopt.&lt;ref&gt; Introducing Theologies of Religions. Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 2002. 256 pp. {{ISBN|1-57075-419-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Replacement Model===

This tracks to the third of the three point models, i.e. Exclusivism, but is split into two subsections: Total Replacement and Partial Replacement. The Total Replacement model is most frequently found in [[Fundamentalist Christians|Fundamentalist]]/[[Evangelical]] churches, and largely represents the work of [[Karl Barth]]. It suggests that the reason the Christian religion is considered true is that it realizes that all religion is false (including itself), and recognizes that the only true belief can be found in Jesus. It does not necessarily say that there is nothing of value in other religions, but simply that there is no use in studying other religions, as everything of value can be found in Christ. The Partial Replacement model has similar things to say about other religions, but does not go so far as to say that there is nothing of value in other religions. It suggests that other religions might have access to God's revelation, but not to God's salvation. This is an important distinction, as it implies that some truth can be found in other religions, but not whole of the truth, and not enough to receive salvation. This view is largely based on the views expressed by the [[World Council of Churches]] in their discussion on religious dialogue and theology.

===The Fulfillment Model===

Knitter's main contribution, informed by his Christian faith and the idea that Christianity is a fulfillment of Judaism, implies that, while the previous religion was not wrong, it was incomplete and awaiting later fulfillment. This view is also held by some forms of Islam with respect to Christianity and Judaism before them, as well as by Mormonism and all other faiths who feel they have a later clarification from God.

However, one's religion does not have to be founded after others in order to see one's religion as a fulfillment. For instance, some Christian theologians argue that if their faith *arrives* later than the indigenous religion, even if in history Christianity came first, such indigenous systems were "God's placeholder," often with common truths learned from nature mixed with erroneous revelatory truths, that can be fulfilled and corrected with the revealed truth of the Christian Scriptures.

Proponents of this view include [[Karl Rahner]], whose appreciation of the phrase "all grace is Christ's grace" led him to the controversial theory of "anonymous Christians" - those who are already saved by the light they have, yet have not yet heard the gospel.&lt;ref&gt;Knitter, 72, 73. See also, Karl Rahner, “Christianity and the non-Christian Religions,” in Theological Investigations (Baltimore: Helicon Press, 1966) 5:115-134&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Mutuality Model===

This model admits that an admixture of truth, error, and incompleteness of revelation exists in all religions, and we need one another to understand and find the truth. While this is a type of pluralism, it does not go so far as to admit that everyone is right, or that there is no objective truth - it only admits that we must learn from one another to find it. It may be that one or another faith is wrong on even major doctrines - but it is also right and has some value in contributing to the whole. 

===The Acceptance Model===
This is Knitter's analog of pure pluralism. All paths may lead to God, and no one can affirm surely that their way is correct. We must all learn from one another, and pull back from making any absolute claims about spiritual matters. As a type of utilitarianism, it takes a subjective approach that admits that various viewpoints may work or not work for the individual, and that is the measure of truth, and any claims beyond that are speculation.

A '''traditional grammar''' is a framework for the description of the structure of a [[language]]. The roots of traditional grammar are in the work of classical Greek and Latin [[philologist]]s. The formal study of [[grammar]] based on these models became popular during the Renaissance. 

Traditional grammars may be contrasted with more modern theories of grammar in [[theoretical linguistics]], which grew out of traditional descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dyer|first=Matthew|editor=F. Ameka |editor2=A. Dench |editor3=N. Evans|title=Catching Language: The Standing Challenge of Grammar Writing|year=2006|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-018603-1|pages=207–234|chapter=Descriptive theories, explanatory theories, and Basic Linguistic Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; While traditional grammars seek to describe how particular languages are used, or to teach people to speak or read them, [[grammar framework]]s in contemporary linguistics often seek to explain the nature of language knowledge and ability. Traditional grammar is often preferred by [[prescriptive]] grammarians and may be regarded as unscientific by those working in linguistics &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Algeo|first1=John|title=Linguistics: Where do we go from here?|journal=The English Journal|date=1969|volume=58|issue=1|pages=102-112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Allison|editor1-last=Strazny|editor1-first=Philipp|title=Encyclopedia of linguistics 2v|date=2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|chapter=Traditional Grammar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Western grammars generally classify words into [[parts of speech]]. They describe the patterns for word [[inflection]], and the rules of [[syntax]] by which those words are combined into sentences.

==History==
Among the earliest studies of grammar are descriptions of [[Sanskrit]], called [[vyākaraṇa]]. The Indian grammarian [[Pāṇini]] wrote the ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'', a [[descriptive grammar]] of Sanskrit, sometime between the 4th and the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name="Cardona"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cardona|first=George|title=Pāṇini: A Survey of Research|year=1997|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1494-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris |first=William |title=Language and linguistics: A broad overview|url=http://community.middlebury.edu/~harris/linguistics.html |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work, along with some grammars of Sanskrit produced around the same time, is often considered the beginning of [[linguistics]] as a [[descriptive science]],&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; and consequently wouldn't be considered "traditional grammar" despite its aniquity. Although Pāṇini's work was not known in Europe until many centuries later, it is thought to have greatly influenced other grammars produced in Asia, such as the ''[[Tolkāppiyam]]'', a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] grammar generally dated between the 2nd and 1st century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Swamy|first=B.G.L.|title=Annals of Oriental Research|year=1975|publisher=University of Madras|chapter=The Date of Tolkappiyam—a Retrospect.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The formal study of grammar became popular in Europe during the [[Renaissance]]. Descriptive grammars were rarely used in [[Classical Greece]] or in [[Latin]] through the [[Medieval period]].&lt;ref name="Celce-Murcia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Celce-Murcia|first=Marianne|title=Teaching English As a Second Or Foreign Language|year=1991|publisher=Heinle and Heinle|isbn=9780838428603}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Renaissance, Latin and [[Classical Greek]] were broadly studied along with the literature and philosophy written in those languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perry|first1=Marvin|last2=Baker|first2=J. Wayne|last3=Hollinger|first3=Pamela Pfeiffer|title=The Humanities in the Western Tradition: Ideas and Aesthetics|year=2002|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-395-84811-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the invention of the [[printing press]] and the use of Vulgate Latin as a [[lingua franca]] throughout Europe, the study of grammar became part of [[language education|language teaching and learning]].&lt;ref name="Celce-Murcia"/&gt;

Although complete grammars were rare, Ancient Greek [[philologist]]s and Latin teachers of [[rhetoric]] produced some descriptions of the structure of language.&lt;ref name="Frede"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frede|first=Michael|title=Essays in Ancient Philosophy|year=1987|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-1275-8|pages=338–359|chapter=The origins of traditional grammar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The descriptions produced by [[Grammarian (Greco-Roman world)|classical grammarians]] (teachers of philology and rhetoric) provided a model for traditional grammars in Europe. According to linguist William Harris, "Just as the Renaissance confirmed Greco-Roman tastes in poetry, rhetoric and architecture, it established ancient Grammar, especially that which the Roman school-grammarians had developed by the 4th [century CE], as an inviolate system of logical expression."&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; The earliest descriptions of other European languages were modeled on grammars of Latin. The primacy of Latin in traditional grammar persisted until the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

The use of grammar descriptions in the teaching of language, including [[foreign language]] teaching and the study of [[language arts]], has gone in and out of fashion.&lt;ref name="Celce-Murcia"/&gt; As education increasingly took place in [[vernacular]] languages at the close of the Renaissance, grammars of these languages were produced for teaching. Between 1801 and 1900 there were more than 850 grammars of [[English language|English]] published specifically for use in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michael|first=Ian|editor=Gerhard Leitner|title=English Traditional Grammars: An International Perspective|year=1991|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=978-90-272-4549-6|pages=11–26|chapter=More than enough English grammars}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mastering grammar rules like those derived from the study of Latin has at times been a specific goal of English-language education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cobbett|first=William|title=A Grammar of the English Language, etc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pf1xmAEACAAJ|accessdate=18 December 2013|year=1833|publisher=William Cobbett}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach to teaching has, however, long competed with approaches that downplay the importance of grammar instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howatt|first=Anthony|title=A History of English Language Teaching|year=1985|publisher=University Press|isbn=978-0-19-437075-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in foreign or [[second language]] teaching, the [[grammar-translation method]] based on traditional Latin teaching, in which the grammar of the language being learned is described in the student's native language, has competed with approaches such as the [[direct method (education)|direct method]] or the [[communicative approach]], in which grammar instruction is minimized.&lt;ref name="Celce-Murcia"/&gt;

==Parts of speech==
{{main|Part of speech}}
The parts of speech are an important element of traditional grammars, since patterns of [[inflection]] and rules of [[syntax]] each depend on a word's part of speech.

Although systems vary somewhat, typically traditional grammars name eight parts of speech: [[noun]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[verb]]s, [[adverb]]s, [[preposition]]s, [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]], and [[interjection]]s.&lt;ref name="Malmkjaer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Malmkjaer|first=Kirsten|title=The Routledge Linguistics Encyclopedia|year=2009 |publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-87495-0|pages=251–265|chapter=History of grammar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huddleston"&gt;{{cite book|last=Huddleston|first=Rodney|title=Introduction to the Grammar of English|year=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-29704-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groupings are based on categories of function and meaning in Latin and other [[Indo-European languages]]. Some traditional grammars include other parts of speech, such as [[Article (grammar)|articles]] or [[determiner (linguistics)|determiners]], though some grammars treat other groupings of words as subcategories of the major parts of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hurford|first=James R.|title=Grammar: A Student's Guide|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-45627-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional definitions of parts of speech refer to the role that a word plays in a sentence, its [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], or both.&lt;ref name="Huddleston" /&gt;

*A '''noun''' is a name for something—whatever one wants to refer to in order to talk about it.
** A '''common noun''' refers to something abstract: a kind of object (''table, radio''), a kind of living thing (''cat, person''), a kind of place (''home, city''), a kind of action (''running, laughter, extinction''), a kind of attribute (''redness, size''), a kind of relationship (''closeness, partnership''), or anything at all, no matter how abstract (''two, god, diversity, corporation'').
** A '''proper noun''' refers to a specific thing (''[[Jesse Owens]], Felix the Cat, Pittsburgh, Zeus,'').
*A '''pronoun''' is a word used in place of a noun (''she'' in place of her name).
* An '''adjective''' [[Grammatical modifier|modifies]] a noun or pronoun; it describes the thing referred to (''red'' in "My shirt is red" or "My red shirt is in the laundry.").
*A '''verb''' signifies the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] of the sentence. That is, a verb indicates what is being [[Logical assertion|asserted]] or [[question|asked]] about the subject of the sentence (''is'' in "My shirt is red"; ''own'' in "I own this house"; ''ran'' in "Jesse Owens ran in the 1936 Olympics").{{refn|group=note|Alternately, some grammars define verbs as words that name actions or states of being.&lt;ref name="Huddleston" /&gt;}}
*An '''adverb''' modifies a verb, an adjective, other adverbs, or the whole sentence (''happily'' in "People danced happily", "Happily, I was paid on time").
*A '''preposition''' indicates a relationship between a noun or pronoun, called the '''object''' of the preposition, and another part of the sentence. The other part of the sentence may be a noun or pronoun, a verb, or an adjective.  (''in'' in "Jesse Owens ran in the 1936 Olympics"; ''on'' in "A store on Main St. sells antique chairs")
**The object of a preposition takes an '''oblique case''' (''me'' in "Amanda borrowed money from me"; see [[Oblique case]]).
*A '''conjunction''' joins parts of sentences, such as nouns, verbs, or clauses, into larger units (''and'' in "[[Mack Robinson (athlete)|Mack Robinson]] and Jesse Owens ran in the 1936 Olympics"; ''because'' in "Amanda borrowed money from me because she needed to pay the rent").
*An '''interjection''' expresses [[emotion]] (''Ouch!'') or calls to someone (''Hey'' in "Hey, you!").&lt;ref name="Curme"&gt;{{cite book|last=Curme|first=George Oliver|title=Parts of Speech and Accidence|year=1935|publisher=D.C. Heath}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Donatus"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/don.html | title=De Partibus Orationis Ars Minor | author=Donatus, Aelius | year=350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary linguists argue that classification based on a mixture of [[morphosyntax|morphosyntactic]] function and [[semantics|semantic]] meaning is insufficient for systematic analysis of grammar. Such definitions are not sufficient on their own to assign a word an unambiguous part of speech. Nonetheless, similar definitions have been used in most traditional grammars.&lt;ref name="Huddleston" /&gt;

==Accidence==
{{main|Inflection}}
Accidence, also known as inflection, is the change of a word's form depending on its grammatical function. The change may involve the addition of [[affix]]es or else changes in the sounds of the word, known as vowel gradation or [[ablaut]].&lt;ref name="Glossary"&gt;{{cite book|last=Upsher Smith|first=Richard|year=2011|title=A Glossary of Terms in Grammar, Rhetoric, and Prosody for Readers of Greek and Latin|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers|isbn=978-1-61041-060-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some words feature [[irregular inflection]], not taking an affix or following a regular pattern of sound change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clahsen|first=Harald|editor=E.K. Brown|title=Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics|volume=4|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-044299-0|pages=1–5|chapter=Dual mechanism morphology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Verbs may be inflected for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical mood|mood]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], and [[voice (grammar)|voice]]. A verb inflected for tense and mood is called finite; non-finite verb forms are [[infinitive]]s or [[participle]]s.&lt;ref  name="Millet"&gt;{{cite web|last=Millet|first=Bella|date=9 September 2011|url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/~wpwt/notes/grammar.htm|title=Introduction to traditional grammar|publisher=Wessex Parallel WebTexts, University of Southampton|accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Verb tense indicates the time that the sentence describes. A verb has [[grammatical person|person]] and [[grammatical number|number]], which must [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with the subject of the sentence. The voice of the verb indicates whether the subject of the sentence is [[active voice|active]] or [[passive voice|passive]] in regard to the verb. A verb also has mood, indicating whether the sentence describes reality or expresses a command, a hypothesis, a hope, etc.

Verbs as well as nouns, pronouns, and adjectives may be inflected for person, number, and [[grammatical gender|gender]]. The inflection of verbs is also known as [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]].&lt;ref  name="Millet"/&gt;

Nouns, pronouns, and adjectives may also be inflected for [[grammatical case|case]]. The inflection of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives is also known as [[declension]].&lt;ref  name="Millet"/&gt;

Noun case indicates how the noun relates to other elements of the sentence (''I, me'' in "I see Jesse" and "Jesse sees me").&lt;ref name="Donatus" /&gt; Number indicates whether the noun refers to one, [[Dual (grammatical number)|two]], or [[Plural|many]] instances of its kind. 

A traditional means of learning accidence is through conjugation tables or declension tables, lists of the various forms of a word for a learner to memorize. The following tables present partial conjugation of the Latin verb ''esse'' and it's English equivalent, ''be''.&lt;ref name="Glossary"/&gt;

This partial table includes only two tenses ([[Present tense|present]] and [[preterite]]) and one mood ([[indicative]]) in addition to the infinitive. A more complete conjugation table for Latin would also include the [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] and [[imperative mood]]s and the [[imperfect|imperfect indicative]], which indicates [[imperfective aspect]].&lt;ref name="Glossary"/&gt; In English the imperative often has the same form as the infinitive, while the [[English subjunctive]] often has the same form as the indicative.&lt;ref name="Curme"/&gt; English does not have imperfective aspect as Latin does; it has [[progressive aspect|progressive]] and [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] aspects in addition to the simple form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Downing|first1=Angela|last2=Locke|first2=Philip|title=A University Course in English Grammar|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-28810-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax==
{{main|Syntax|Sentence (linguistics)}}
Syntax is the set of rules governing how words combine into phrases and [[clause]]s. It deals with the formation of [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, including rules governing or describing how sentences are formed.&lt;ref name="Glossary"/&gt; In traditional usage, syntax is sometimes called ''grammar'', but the word grammar is also used more broadly to refer to various aspects of language and its [[usage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butterfield|first=Jeremy|title=Damp Squid: The English Language Laid Bare|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-923906-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional grammar syntax, a sentence is analyzed as having two parts, a [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]. The subject is the thing being talked about. In English and similar languages, the subject usually occurs at the beginning of the sentence, but this is not always the case.{{refn|group=note|English is classified as a [[subject–verb–object]] language, since the parts of a sentence typically occur in that order. See the article [[Word order]] for further discussion.}} The predicate comprises the rest of the sentence, all of the parts of the sentence that are not the subject.&lt;ref  name="Millet"/&gt;

The subject of a sentence is generally a noun or pronoun, or a [[phrase]] containing a noun or pronoun. If the sentence features [[active voice]], the thing named by the subject carries out the action of the sentence; in the case of [[passive voice]], the subject is affected by the action. In sentences with [[imperative mood]], the subject may not be expressed.
*''Zoltan'' ate the cake. (Zoltan, the subject of this active sentence, carried out the action of eating.)
*''The cake'' was baked for Zora's birthday. (The cake, the subject of this passive sentence, is affected by the action of baking.)
*Bake another cake. (In this imperative sentence, the subject is not expressed. The [[Implication (pragmatics)|implied]] subject is ''you''.)

The predicate of a sentence may have many parts, but the only required element is a finite verb. In addition to the verb, the predicate may contain one or more [[object (grammar)|object]]s, a [[subject complement]], [[Complement (linguistics)#Predicative, subject and object complements|object complements]], [[adpositional phrase]]s (in English, these are prepositional phrases), or  [[adverbial]] elements.&lt;ref  name="Millet"/&gt;

Some verbs (called [[transitive verb]]s) take direct objects; some also take indirect objects. A direct object names the person or thing directly affected by the action of an active sentence. An indirect object names the entity indirectly affected. In a sentence with both a direct and an indirect object, the indirect object generally appears before the direct object.&lt;ref  name="Millet"/&gt;

In the following sentence, the direct object, ''the book'', is directly affected by the action; it is what is given. The indirect object, ''Nikolai'', is indirectly affected; he receives the book as a result of it being given.
*Yuri gave ''Nikolai'' the book.
In place of an indirect object, a prepositional phrase beginning with ''to'' or ''for'' may occur after the direct object.&lt;ref  name="Millet"/&gt;
*Yuri gave the book ''to Nikolai''.

A subject complement (variously called a [[predicative expression]], predicative, predicate noun or adjective, or complement) appears in a predicate with a [[linking verb]] (also called a copula). A subject complement is a noun, adjective, or phrase that refers to the subject of the linking verb, illustrated in the following examples.
*Elizabeth is ''a doctor''.
*Salim is ''clever''.
*Kerli is ''from Estonia''.
While subject complements describe or modify the subject of a linking verb, object complements describe or modify nouns in the predicate, typically direct or indirect objects, or objects of adpositions. In the following example, the phrase ''sun's origin'' is a complement of the direct object ''Japan''.
*Chinese scholars called Japan "''sun's origin''".

A subject and a predicate together make up a [[clause]].

Although some traditional grammars consider adpositional phrases and adverbials part of the predicate, many grammars call these elements [[adjunct (grammar)|adjuncts]], meaning they are not a required element of the syntactic structure. Adjuncts may occur anywhere in a sentence.

Adpositional phrases can add to or modify the meaning of nouns, verbs, or adjectives. An adpositional phrase is a phrase that features either [[Preposition and postposition|a preposition, a postposition, or a circumposition]]. All three types of words have similar function; the difference is where the adposition appears relative to the other words in the phrase. Prepositions occur before their complements while postpositions appear after. Circumpositions consist of two parts, one before the complement and one after.
*'''[[French language|French]]''' prepositional phrase: ''sur'' la table ("''on'' the table")
*'''[[Chinese language|Chinese]]''' postpositional phrase: 桌子''上'' (zhuōzi ''shàng'' "''on'' the table")
*'''[[Sorani Kurdish]]''' circumpostional phrase: ''la'' Kurdistân' ''â'' ("''in'' Kurdistan")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thackston |first=W.M. |title=Sorani Kurdish: A Reference Grammar with Selected Readings|publisher=Harvard University Faculty of Arts &amp; Sciences|year=2006|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An adverbial consists of either a single adverb, an [[adverbial phrase]], or an [[adverbial clause]] that modifies either the verb or the sentence as a whole. Some traditional grammars consider adpositional phrases a type of adverb, but many grammars treat these as separate. Adverbials may modify time, place, or manner. [[Affirmative and negative|Negation]] is also frequently indicated with adverbials, including adverbs such as English ''not''.

'''''Who Were the Early Israelites and Where Did They Come From?''''' is a book by American biblical scholar and archaeologist [[William G. Dever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dever|first=William G.|authorlink=William G. Dever|title=Who were the early Israelites, and where did they come from?|year=2003|publisher=Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|isbn=0-8028-0975-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dever has been prominent in the debate between biblical "maximalists" and "[[Minimalism (Biblical archaeology)|minimalists]]" over the [[historicity of the Bible]] (specifically the [[Old Testament]]). This book, which coincided with Dever's retirement from the [[University of Arizona]], where he served as professor of [[Near Eastern Archaeology]] and Anthropology for many years, was written on a semi-popular level to explain the background and origin of the people Dever describes as the "protoIsraelites."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hawkins, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0LAL/is_3_33/ai_107759382/  Review of "Who Were the Early Israelites"],{{dead link|date=August 2016}} ''Biblical Theological Bulletin'', Fall 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It followed an earlier book, ''[[What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?]]'', in which Dever, contrary to the "minimalists", asserted that the writers of the Old Testament knew a good deal about the [[Israelites]]' past.&lt;ref&gt;John Barclay Burns, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0LAL/is_1_34/ai_n6147831   review of ''Who Were the Early Israelites?''],{{dead link|date=August 2016}} ''Biblical Theological Bulletin'', Spring 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

A political boss, known as a Za'im, is from the leading family in the country's electoral districts. They manipulate elections and distribute political favours and financial rewards to the highest bidder. A za'im can run for office or encourage votes for another to have another in his debt. Votes are often obtained through [[bribery]] or force. Individuals elected to parliament view their primary goal to serve the needs of their local clients, neglect any national issues and use parliament to further their regional-[[sectarianism|sectarian]] interests.
