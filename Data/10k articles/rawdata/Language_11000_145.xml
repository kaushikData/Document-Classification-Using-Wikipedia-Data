'''Atin Bandyopadhyay''' or '''Atin Banerjee''', ({{lang-bn|অতীন বন্দ্যোপাধ্যায়}}; anglicised spelling of surname: '''Banerjee''') is a writer of [[Bengali literature]]. He was born in 1934 in [[Dhaka]].&lt;ref name="Atin Bandyopadhyay, 1934"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atin Bandyopadhyay, 1934|url=https://www.loc.gov/acq/ovop/delhi/salrp/atinbandyopadhyay.html|publisher=LOC|accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He spent his childhood in a joint family set-up in the then East Bengal of undivided India and studied in Sonar Gaon Panam School. After the Partition, migrated to India. He earned his undergraduate degree in commerce in 1956 and subsequently earned a teacher's training degree, all from the [[University of Calcutta]]. He took various jobs as a sailor, truck-cleaner, primary school teacher. Also became headmaster of a senior basic school. He became the head master of Satui Rajendra Narayan High School which is situated near Chowrigacha Railway Station in Murshidabad district. Settled permanently in [[Kolkata]] in 1986. Here also he took on various jobs like factory manager, publication advisor and lastly journalist.

==Career as a writer==
The first story of the author was published in the magazine ''Abasar'' of Berhampore. He has penned many works since then, but his masterpiece is a four-part tetralogy on the Partition: ''Nilkantha Pakhir Khonje'',"Manusher Gharbari" ''Aloukik Jalajan'' and ''Ishwarer Bagan''. Another famous writer of Bengal, [[Syed Mustafa Siraj]] has compared ''Nilkantha Pakhir Khonje'', with Greek tragedies and also found it tuned with the core spirit with the Bengali literature like [[Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay|Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay]]'s ''Pather Panchali''.&lt;ref&gt;Ishwarer Bagan by Atin Bandyopadhyay, 1st combined edition, Karuna Prakashani, Kolkata, Oct. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:August blanche.jpg|thumb|'''August Blanche''' (1811-1868).]]
'''August Blanche''' (17 September 1811 – 30 November 1868) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] journalist, novelist, and [[Democratic socialism|socialist]] politician.

==Life==
August Theodor Blanche was born in [[Stockholm, Sweden]], the illegitimate child of a servant girl and a priest. His mother eventually married Johan Jacob Blanck, a blacksmith and the boy took his stepfather's name. A brilliant student, in 1838 he obtained a [[law degree]] and for a time, worked as a civil servant until taking up journalism. In the early 1840s, he began writing plays for the theater as well as translating plays from foreign languages into Swedish. By the middle of the decade, he was writing novels and short stories of intrigue, all of which met with a great deal of success.

An activist, in 1859 Blanche was elected to the [[Riksdag|Swedish Parliament]] where he served until 1866. He died of unknown causes two years later, on 30 November 1868, on the way to participate in the unveiling of the statue of King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles the XII]], which he had lobbied for.

August Blanche is interred in the [[Norra begravningsplatsen]] in Stockholm.

'''Kriol''' is an [[English-based creole languages|English-based]] [[creole language]] that developed from a [[pidgin]] used initially in the region of [[Sydney]] and [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] in the early days of [[Colonisation of Australia|European colonisation]]. Later, it moved west and north. The pidgin died out in most parts of the country, except in the [[Northern Territory]], where the contact between European settlers, Chinese and other Asians and the [[Indigenous Australians]] in the northern regions has maintained a vibrant use of the language, spoken by about 30,000 people. Despite its similarities to [[English language|English]] in vocabulary, it has a distinct syntactic structure and grammar and is a language in its own right.

==History==
European settlement in the [[Northern Territory]] was attempted over a period of about forty years. Settlement finally succeeded in 1870, and an influx of both English and [[Chinese Language|Chinese]] speakers followed. In order to communicate between these two groups and the local Aboriginal people, [[pidgin]]s developed throughout the territory based on [[Port Jackson Pidgin English]]. By 1900, Northern Territory Pidgin English (NTPE) was widespread and well understood.

It creolised first in the Roper River Mission (Ngukurr), where cattle stations were established and a township developed.

During this period, the relations between the native and European people were strained. Aboriginal people fiercely defended their lands. However, the control of lands was eventually seized by the settlers, when a cattle company acquired much of the area. The settlers became more determined to take full control of the land from the native people and carried out a campaign to do so.

The resettlements and land seizures nearly annihilated the indigenous population and also provided one major factor in the development of the creole: drastic social change accompanied by severe communication difficulties.

The second requirement for the development of the creole was a new community, which came about when Anglican missionaries set up a refuge in the Roper River region in 1908. This brought together around 200 people from 8 different aboriginal ethnic groups, who spoke different native languages. Although the adults were multilingual because of frequent meetings and ceremonies, the children had yet to acquire their native language skills and so used the only common language they had: the NTPE. In their lifetime, these children were almost totally responsible for developing the pidgin into a full language.

Although the relations between the missionaries and Aboriginal people were friendly, the missions were not responsible for the development of Kriol. In fact, they tried to introduce [[Standard English]] as the official language for the mission, which the Aboriginal children used in class and with the missionaries, but Kriol still flourished.

Kriol was not recognised as a language until the 1970s, as it was regarded as a dialect of English rather than a language in its own right.

== Varieties ==
Kriol is very widely spoken in the [[Katherine, Northern Territory|Katherine]] area, but there are minor differences between the varieties of Kriol spoken in particular areas. Some speakers of Kriol prefer to refer to their language by their unique name. However, the varieties are quite similar. Debate is ongoing about whether the varieties should be named differently to highlight their different social significance or the varieties should all be lumped into one big category of Kriol.

The differences are not actually that large: Mari Rhydwen compares the distinction to the distinction between American and British English.

Roper River (Ngukurr) Kriol is also spoken in Barunga, and in the Daly River area a mutually intelligible variety is spoken, but Daly River speakers do not consider themselves to be Kriol speakers. There is the question of whether the varieties should be understood as different forms of Kriol to strengthen the identities of the respective region or they all should be seen as Kriol and potentially have a better chance of funding for bilingual education programs.

==Kriol Bible translation==
On 5 May 2007, the first complete edition of the [[Bible]] in the Kriol language was launched at [[Katherine, Northern Territory|Katherine]] in the Northern Territory. Translation took over 29 years. It was undertaken by a team of native Kriol speakers led by Rev. Canon Gumbuli Wurrumara and specialists from the Society for Australian Indigenous Languages.

The Kriol Bible is the first complete edition of the Bible in any indigenous Australian language. The publication was a joint venture of The Bible Society, Lutheran Bible Translators, The Church Missionary Society, the Anglican church, Wycliffe Bible Translators and the Australian Society of Indigenous Languages.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Peter J. 2004. From the beginning to Proverbs. ''The Bible Translator'' 55.4: 491-497.&lt;/ref&gt; The following is Genesis 1:1,2 from this translation: "Orait, longtaim wen God bin stat meigimbat ebrijing, nomo enijing bin jidan. Imbin jis eniwei, nomo garram enijing. Oni strongbala woda bin goran goran ebriwei, en imbin brabli dakbala, en det spirit blanga God bin mubabat ontop langa det woda."&lt;ref&gt;[http://aboriginalbibles.org.au/Kriol/Conc/root.htm The Kriol Bible, full text]  Retrieved 25 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
Dialects of the Kriol includes Roper River Kriol (Roper River Pidgin), Bamyili Creole, Barkly Kriol, Fitzroy Valley Kriol, and Daly River Kriol.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=rop&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current issues==
A problem facing many communities in Northern Australia is that creole-speaking children are treated as though they speak English, but speak it badly; so they do not receive education in English as a second language. On the other hand, because they are not regarded as having a native mother tongue, they are denied access to education in their traditional language.

The only official bilingual language program in Kriol is at [[Barunga]], which was established during the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] government, and has successfully included Kriol as both a medium and an object of study. Funding is scarce for any further development of programs. Although Kriol is widely spoken, its literal translation is minimal, with the exception of the Bible, and stories produced for the bilingual program which are available through the [[Living Archive of Aboriginal Languages]]. This means that literacy rates of Kriol are quite low. Apart from practical implications of this, especially if English literacy is also low (i.e., written communication, education opportunities), it means that traditional stories are either not recorded in written form, or the [[Ngukurr]] people must rely on texts from Barunga, which may lessen the identity distinction between the two groups. However, Aboriginal cultures are not traditionally rooted in written records, so the lack of written versions of texts may be a function of the oral nature of Aboriginal storytelling.

'''Batty (Jean-Baptiste) Weber''' (1860–1940) is considered to have been one of [[Luxembourg]]'s most influential journalists and authors, contributing much to the development of the country's national identity.&lt;ref&gt;"Weber, Batty (Jean-Baptiste)", ''Luxemburger Lexikon'', Editions Guy Binsfeld, Luxembourg, 2006. {{De icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.routes-granderegion.eu/index.php?pn=personnage_detail&amp;id=57&amp;PHPSESSID=vqlyiuvkvg Claire Soriano, "Batty Weber"], ''Institut européen des itinéraires culturels''. {{Fr icon}} Retrieved 2 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His style is characterized by his sense of humour and skillful use of irony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stamps.luxcentral.com/LuxStamps1990.html#Weber "Luxembourg Stamps: 1990"]. Retrieved 2 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Born on 25 November 1860 in [[Rumelange]] in south-western Luxembourg, he was the son of the local schoolmaster, Michel Weber, and his wife Marie-Catherine Klein. The family soon moved to [[Stadtbredimus]] on the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] where Weber spent much of his childhood. After attending the [[Athénée de Luxembourg|Athénée]] in [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg City]], he studied philology at the universities of Berlin and Bonn, developing an interest in the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luxemburgensia.bnl.lu/cgi/getPdf1_2.pl?mode=page&amp;id=15153&amp;option= "Batty Weber erzählt seine Lebengeschichte"]. {{De icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

After his studies, Weber started to work in Luxembourg's civil service administration, developing his skills as a stenographer. Not satisfied with administrative work, he began to contribute to newspapers publishing his first short story "Mein Freund Günther" in ''[[Das Luxemburger Land]]'' in 1883. He was soon contributing both news articles and short stories to newspapers at home and abroad. After "Wolf Frank" (1887) was published in the ''Luxemburger Zeitung'', Weber began to contribute to the ''Escher Zeitung'' with "Bella Ghitta" (1889), his first story about the mining area of the south, followed by "Hart am Abgrund" (1890), "Der Amerikaner" (1891) and "Die Verderberin" (1891). In 1893, he became editor in chief at the ''Luxemburger Zeitung''.&lt;ref name=onsstad&gt;[http://onsstad.lu/index.php?id=242&amp;L=0&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bcat%5D=66&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=844&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=240&amp;cHash=37fed5586c Sylvie Kremer-Schmit, "Batty Weber"], ''Ons stad'', No 35, 1990. {{De icon}} Retrieved 2 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber also began to write poems in [[Luxembourgish]] including "Dem Jabbo seng Kap" which is still popular in Luxembourg today. His once highly successful but now forgotten first novel "Fenn Kass, Roman eines Erlösten" draws on his schooldays in Luxembourg. It was serialized in the ''Kölnische Zeitung'' in 1912 before being published in book form the following year. While his novels were written in German, most of the numerous light-hearted plays from 1895 to 1922 were in Luxembourgish although "A Mondorf" (1900) and "Le couscous de la belle-mère" were in French.&lt;ref name=onsstad/&gt;

In 1923, in connection with Dicks' 100th anniversary, he published his "Erënnerongen un den Dicks". Weber also did much to promote Luxembourg's budding cultural talents including authors such as [[Alex Weicker]], [[Marie-Henriette Steil]], [[Albert Hoefler]] and [[Emile Marx]] and the painters [[Joseph Kutter]], [[Harry Rabinger]], [[Jean Schaak]] and [[Nico Klopp]]. One of Weber's most important contributions to Luxembourg's identity was his "Abreisskalender", a daily column he contributed from 1913 to 1940 to the "Luxembuger Zeitung", commenting on items of local cultural interest.&lt;ref name=onsstad/&gt;

In 1904 (23 July 1904), he married Emma Brugmann. Batty Weber died in Luxembourg City on 14 December 1940, and was buried in the Notre-Dame Cemetery.

==Batty Weber Prize==

Since 1987, the [[Batty Weber Prize]], Luxembourg's national literary prize, has been awarded to a Luxembourg writer for his entire literary work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnl.public.lu/auteurs/prix_batty_weber/index.html "Prix Batty Weber"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723090946/http://www.cnl.public.lu/auteurs/prix_batty_weber/index.html |date=July 23, 2011 }}, ''Centre national de litérature''. {{Fr icon}} Retrieved 6 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bulkhead''' is an upright wall within the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] of a ship or within the [[fuselage]] of an [[aeroplane]].  Other kinds of partition elements within a ship are [[deck (ship)|decks]] and [[deckhead]]s.

==Etymology==
The word ''bulki'' meant "cargo" in [[Old Norse]].  Sometime in the 15th century sailors and builders in Europe realized that walls within a vessel would prevent cargo from shifting during passage. In shipbuilding, any vertical panel was called a "head". So walls installed abeam (side-to-side) in a vessel's hull were called "bulkheads."{{dubious|other etymologies are given, and, IMO, more likely|date=March 2017}}  Now, the term '''bulkhead''' applies to every vertical panel aboard a ship, except for the hull itself.

==History==
{{see also|Naval history of China}}
[[File:Song Dynasty Ancient Ship of Quanzhou Bay 20061229.jpg|thumb|The remains of the [[Quanzhou ship]], dated to the [[Song dynasty]] and discovered in 1973]]
Bulkhead partitions are considered to have been a feature of Chinese [[Junk (ship)|junks]], a type of ship. Song Dynasty author [[Zhu Yu (author)|Zhu Yu]] (fl. 12th century) wrote in his book of 1119 that the [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] of [[Junk (ship)|Chinese ships]] had a bulkhead build. The 5th-century book ''Garden of Strange Things'' by Liu Jingshu mentioned that a ship could allow water to enter the bottom without sinking. Archaeological evidence of bulkhead partitions has been found on a 24&amp;nbsp;m (78&amp;nbsp;ft) long Song Dynasty ship dredged from the waters off the southern coast of China in 1973, the hull of the ship divided into twelve walled [[Compartment (ship)|compartmental]] sections built [[Waterproofing|watertight]], dated to about 1277.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey, Patricia Buckley, Anne Walthall, James B. Palais (2006). ''East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company. {{ISBN|0-618-13384-4}}, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Texts written by Western writers such as [[Marco Polo]] (1254–1324),  [[Niccolò Da Conti]] (1395–1469), and [[Benjamin Franklin]] (1706–1790) describe the bulkhead partitions of East Asian shipbuilding.&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;Needham, Joseph. (1971). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4, Physics and Physical Technology, Part 3, Civil Engineering and Nautics''. Cambridge University Press., reprinted Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd.(1986), pp. 391, 420–422, 462-463.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gernet, Jacques. (1996). ''A History of Chinese Civilization''. Translated by J.R. Foster and Charles Hartman. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-49781-7}}, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; An account of the early fifteenth century describes Indian ships as being built in compartments so that even if one part was damaged, the rest remained intact — a forerunner of the modern day watertight compartments using bulkheads.&lt;ref name=indiannavy&gt;[http://indiannavy.nic.in/ ''Early History'' (Indian Navy)], [[National Informatics Center]], [[Government of India]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulkhead partitions became widespread in Western shipbuilding during the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt; [[Benjamin Franklin]] wrote in a 1787 letter that "as these vessels are not to be laden with goods, their holds may without inconvenience be divided into separate apartments, after the Chinese manner, and each of these apartments caulked tight so as to keep out water."&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamin Franklin|title=The writings of Benjamin Franklin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oOOkRZdjIJYC&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=5 October 2012|year=1906|publisher=The Macmillan Company|pages=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 19th century book on shipbuilding attributes the introduction of watertight bulkheads to Charles Wye Williams, known for his [[City of Dublin Steam Packet Company|steamships]].&lt;ref name="Reed"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir Edward James Reed|title=Shipbuilding in iron and steel: A practical treatise, giving full details of construction, processes of manufacture, and building arrangements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vh1EAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA213|accessdate=5 October 2012|year=1869|publisher=Murray|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
Bulkheads in a ship serve several purposes: 
* increase the structural rigidity of the vessel, 
* divide functional areas into rooms and 
* create [[Compartment (ship)|watertight compartment]]s that can [[ship floodability|contain water]] in the case of a hull breach or other leak. 
* some bulkheads and [[deck (ship)|deck]]s are [[fire-resistance rating|fire-resistance rated]] to achieve [[Compartmentalization (fire protection)|compartmentalisation]], a [[passive fire protection]] measure; see [[firewall (construction)]].

On an aircraft, bulkheads divide the cabin into multiple areas.{{dubious|date=February 2012}}&lt;!-- These are partitions, not bulkheads. They have little or no structural function. --&gt; On passenger aircraft a common application is for physically dividing cabins used for different classes of service (e.g. [[economy class|economy]] and [[business class|business]].) On combination cargo/ passenger, or "combi" aircraft, bulkhead walls are inserted to divide areas intended for passenger seating and cargo storage.

== Requirements of bulkheads ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}
=== Fire-resistance ===
[[Image:Marine firestop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Firestop]]ped [[electrical cable]] penetration in a '''bulkhead''' which is required to have a [[fire-resistance rating]]. The firestop is made of a purpose-designed [[putty]] on the outside and a proprietary [[cement]]itious fill on the inside.]]
Openings in fire-resistance rated bulkheads and decks must be [[firestop]]ped to restore the fire-resistance ratings that would otherwise be compromised, if the openings were left unsealed. The [[Construction#Authority having jurisdiction|authority having jurisdiction]] for such measures varies depending upon the flag of the ship. Merchant vessels are typically subject to the regulations and inspections of the Coast Guards of the flag country. Combat ships are subject to the regulations set out by the navy of the country that owns the ship.

=== Prevention of damage from EMI and EMP ===
Bulkheads and decks of warships may be fully [[Ground (electricity)|grounded]] (electrically) as a [[countermeasure]] against damage from [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI]] and [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] due to nuclear or [[electromagnetic bomb]] detonations near the ship, which could severely damage the vital electronic [[system]]s on a ship. 

In the case of firestops, cable jacketing is usually removed within the seal and firestop rubber modules are internally fitted with copper shields, which contact the cables' armour in order to ground the seal.

== Other uses of the term ==
The term was later applied to other vehicles, such as [[railroad car]]s, [[hopper car]]s, [[tram]]s, [[automobile]]s, [[aircraft]] or [[spacecraft]], as well as to [[Containerization|containers]], [[intermediate bulk container]]s and [[fuel tank]]s. In some of these cases bulkheads are airtight to prevent air leakage or the spread of a fire. The term may also be used for the "end walls" of [[Flatcar#Bulkhead flatcars|bulkhead flatcars]].

Mechanically, a partition or panel through which connectors pass, or a connector designed to pass through a partition.

In [[architecture]] the term is frequently used to denote any boxed in beam or other downstand from a ceiling and by extension even the vertical downstand face of an area of lower ceiling beyond. This usage presumably derives from experience on boats where to maintain the structural function personnel openings through bulkheads always retain a portion of the bulkhead crossing the head of the opening. Head strikes on these downstand elements are commonplace hence in architecture any overhead downstand element comes to be referred to as a bulkhead.

{{LGBT sidebar|culture}}

'''Coming out of the closet''', or simply '''coming out''', is a [[metaphor]] for [[LGBT]] people's [[self-disclosure]] of their [[sexual orientation]] or of their [[gender identity]]. The term ''coming out'' can also be used in various non-LGBT applications (e.g. [[atheists]]).

Framed and debated as a [[privacy]] issue, coming out of the closet is described and experienced variously as a psychological process or journey;&lt;ref name="Coming Out: A Journey"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://utahpridecenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=44 |title=Coming Out: A Journey |publisher=Utahpridecenter.org |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825202112/http://utahpridecenter.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=44 |archivedate=2009-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[decision-making]] or [[Risk|risk-taking]]; a strategy or plan; a mass or public event; a [[speech act]] and a matter of [[Identity (social science)|personal identity]]; a [[rite of passage]]; [[liberty|liberation]] or [[emancipation]] from [[oppression]]; an [[wikt:ordeal|ordeal]];&lt;ref&gt;''Belfast Telegraph'': [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/gaa-star-donal-og-cusack-teammates-helped-me-through-ordeal-of-revealing-i-am-gay-14536491.html "GAA star Donal Og Cusack: Teammates helped me through ordeal of revealing I am gay," October 20, 2009], accessed January 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; a means toward feeling [[gay pride]] instead of [[shame]] and [[social stigma]]; or even career suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Queerty: [http://www.queerty.com/rupert-everett-says-coming-out-killed-his-career-20090220/ Japhy Grant, "Rupert Everett Says Coming Out Killed His Career," February 20, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015003811/http://www.queerty.com/rupert-everett-says-coming-out-killed-his-career-20090220/ |date=October 15, 2010 }}, accessed January 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Steven Seidman]] writes that "it is the power of the closet to shape the core of an individual's life that has made homosexuality into a significant personal, social, and political drama in twentieth-century America".&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, Steven (2003). ''Beyond the Closet; The Transformation of Gay and Lesbian Life'', 25, {{ISBN|0-415-93207-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American gender theorist [[Judith Butler]] argues that the process of  "coming out" does not free gay people from oppression. Although they may feel free to act as themselves, the opacity involved in entering a non-heterosexual territory insinuates judgment upon their identity, she argues in ''Imitation and Gender Insubordination'' (1991).

''Coming out of the closet'' is the source of other [[gay slang]] expressions related to voluntary disclosure or lack thereof. LGBT people who have already revealed or no longer conceal their sexual orientation or gender identity are ''out'', i.e. openly LGBT. Oppositely, LGBT people who have yet to come out or have opted not to do so are labelled as [[Closeted|closeted or being in the closet]]. [[Outing]] is the deliberate or accidental disclosure of an LGBT person's sexual orientation or gender identity, without their consent. By extension, ''outing oneself'' is self-disclosure. ''Glass closet'' means the [[open secret]] of when public figures' being LGBT is considered a widely accepted fact even though they have not officially come out.&lt;ref&gt;''OUT'' magazine: [http://www.out.com/entertainment/2008/09/22/glass-closet Michael Musto, "The Glass Closet," September 22, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705232840/http://www.out.com/entertainment/2008/09/22/glass-closet |date=July 5, 2012 }}, accessed January 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Further|Timeline of LGBT history}}
[[File:Karl Heinrich Ulrichs.jpg|thumb|19th-century gay rights advocate [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] introduced the idea of coming out as a means of emancipation.]]
In 1869, one hundred years before the [[Stonewall riots]], the German homosexual rights advocate [[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]] introduced the idea of self-disclosure as a means of [[emancipation]]. Claiming that invisibility was a major obstacle toward changing [[public opinion]], he urged homosexual people to reveal their same-sex attractions. In his 1906 work, ''Das Sexualleben unserer Zeit in seinen Beziehungen zur modernen Kultur'' (''The Sexual Life of Our Time in its Relation to Modern Civilization''),&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Ivan. ''Das Sexualleben unserer Zeit in seinen Beziehungen zur modernen Kultur'', 1906. English translation: ''The Sexual Life of Our Time in Its Relations to Modern Civilization'', 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iwan Bloch]], a German-Jewish physician, entreated elderly homosexuals to self-disclose to their family members and acquaintances. In 1914, [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] revisited the topic in his major work ''The Homosexuality of Men and Women'', discussing the social and legal potentials of several thousand homosexual men and women of rank revealing their sexual orientation to the police in order to influence legislators and public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Johansson&amp;Percy, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

The first prominent American to reveal his homosexuality was the poet [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]]. In 1944, using his own name in the anarchist magazine ''Politics'', he wrote that homosexuals were an oppressed minority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15949 "Robert Duncan and Romantic Synthesis: A Few Notes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906020604/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15949 |date=2010-09-06 }}. This article also republished as "On Robert Duncan" at Modern American Poetry website&lt;/ref&gt; The decidedly clandestine [[Mattachine Society]], founded by [[Harry Hay]] and other veterans of the [[Henry A. Wallace|Wallace for President]] campaign in Los Angeles in 1950, moved into the public eye after Hal Call took over the group in San Francisco in 1953, with many gays emerging from the closet.

In 1951, [[Donald Webster Cory]]&lt;ref name=sagarin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html|title=Donald Webster Cory |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151656/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html |archive-date=2009-06-06 |publisher= [[glbtq.com]]|author=|date=|website=glbtq.com|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html |title=Sagarin bio |publisher=Glbtq.com |date=1913-09-18 |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151656/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/sagarin_e.html |archivedate=2009-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; published his landmark ''The Homosexual in America'', exclaiming, "Society has handed me a mask to wear...Everywhere I go, at all times and before all sections of society, I pretend." Cory was a pseudonym, but his frank and openly subjective descriptions served as a stimulus to the emerging homosexual self-awareness and the nascent [[homophile]] movement.

In the 1960s, [[Frank Kameny]] came to the forefront of the struggle. Having been fired from his job as an astronomer for the Army Map service in 1957 for homosexual behavior, Kameny refused to go quietly. He openly fought his dismissal, eventually appealing it all the way to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. As a vocal leader of the growing movement, Kameny argued for unapologetic public actions. The cornerstone of his conviction was that, "we must instill in the [[LGBT community|homosexual community]] a sense of worth to the individual homosexual", which could only be achieved through campaigns openly led by homosexuals themselves.
With the spread of [[consciousness raising]] (CR) in the late 1960s, coming out became a key strategy of the [[gay liberation]] movement to raise [[political consciousness]] to counter heterosexism and homophobia. At the same time and continuing into the 1980s, gay and lesbian [[social support]] discussion groups, some of which were called "coming-out groups", focused on sharing coming-out "stories" (experiences) with the goal of reducing isolation and increasing LGBT visibility and [[Gay pride|pride]].

== Sociolinguistic origin ==
The present-day expression "coming out" is understood to have originated in the early 20th century from an [[analogy]] that likens homosexuals' introduction into [[gay subculture]] to a [[débutante]]'s ''coming-out party.'' This is a celebration for a young [[upper-class]] woman who is making her début&amp;nbsp;– her formal presentation to society&amp;nbsp;– because she has reached adult age or has become eligible for marriage. As historian [[George Chauncey]] points out:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Gay people in the pre-war years [pre-WWI]... did not speak of coming out of what we call the gay closet but rather of coming out ''into'' what they called homosexual society or the gay world, a world neither so small, nor so isolated, nor... so hidden as closet implies&lt;ref&gt;Chauncey, George (1994). ''Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890–1940''. New York: Basic Books, emphasis added.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In fact, as Elizabeth Kennedy observes, "using the term 'closet' to refer to" previous times such as "the 1920s and 1930s might be [[anachronism|anachronistic]]".&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Elizabeth. "'But We Would Never Talk about It': The Structure of Lesbian Discretion in South Dakota, 1928–1933" in ''Inventing Lesbian Cultures in America'', ed. Ellen Lewin (1996). Boston: Beacon Press. p.25 and 214&lt;/ref&gt;

An article on coming out&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/coming_out_ssh.html|title=Coming Out, accessed on Aug 31, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014140942/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/coming_out_ssh.html|archivedate=14 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the online encyclopedia [[glbtq.com]] states that [[sexologist]] [[Evelyn Hooker]]'s observations introduced the use of "coming out" to the academic community in the 1950s. The article continues by echoing Chauncey's observation that a subsequent shift in [[connotation]] occurred later on. The pre-1950s focus was on ''entrance'' into "a new world of hope and communal solidarity" whereas the post-[[Stonewall Riots]] overtone was an ''exit'' from the oppression of the closet.&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"/&gt; This change in focus suggests that "coming out ''of the closet''" is a [[mixed metaphor]] that joins "coming out" with the [[Coming out#Closeted|closet]] metaphor: an evolution of "[[wikt:skeleton in the closet|skeleton in the closet]]" specifically referring to living a life of denial and secrecy by concealing one's [[sexual orientation]]. The closet metaphor, in turn, is extended to the forces and pressures of heterosexist society and its institutions.

== Identity issues ==

When coming out is described as a gradual process or a journey,&lt;ref name="Coming Out: A Journey"/&gt; it is meant to include becoming aware of and acknowledging one's gender identity or non-heteronormative sexual orientation. This preliminary stage, which involves soul-searching or a personal [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imfromdriftwood.com/im-from-new-york-ny-5/|title=Gay Epiphany|publisher=|accessdate=8 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014093757/http://imfromdriftwood.com/im-from-new-york-ny-5/|archivedate=14 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often called "coming out to oneself" and constitutes the start of [[self-acceptance]]. Many LGBT people say that this stage began for them during [[adolescence]] or [[childhood]], when they first became aware of their sexual orientation toward members of the same sex. Coming out has also been described as a process because of a recurring need or desire to come out in new situations in which LGBT people are [[Heterosexism|assumed to be heterosexual]] or [[cisgender]], such as at a new job or with new acquaintances. As Diana Fuss (1991) explains, "the problem of course with the inside/outside rhetoric...is that such polemics disguise the fact that most of us are both inside and outside at the same time".

=== LGBT identity development ===
{{Main|Sexual identity#Models of sexual identity development}}
Every coming out story is the person trying to come to terms with who they are and their sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chirrey|first=Deborah|title=I Hereby Come Out: What Sort Of Speech Act Is Coming Out?|journal=Journal of Sociolinguistics|year=2003|volume=7|issue=1|pages=24–37|doi=10.1111/1467-9481.00209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several models have been created to describe coming out as a process for gay and lesbian identity development, e.g. Dank, 1971; Cass, 1984; Coleman, 1989; Troiden, 1989. Of these models, the most widely accepted is the [[Cass identity model]] established by Vivienne Cass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~linemen/articles/genderidentity.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325110617/http://www.uvm.edu/~linemen/articles/genderidentity.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model outlines six discrete stages transited by individuals who successfully come out: identity confusion, identity comparison, identity tolerance, identity acceptance, identity pride, and identity synthesis. However, not every LGBT person follows such a model. For example, some LGBT youth become aware of and accept their same-sex desires or gender identity at puberty in a way similar to which heterosexual teens become aware of their sexuality, i.e. free of any notion of difference, stigma or shame in terms of the gender of the people to whom they are attracted. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Regardless of whether LGBT youth develop their identity based on a model, the typical age at which youth in the United States come out has been dropping. High school students and even middle school students are coming out.&lt;ref&gt;Salon: [http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/feature/2009/09/24/gay_teens/ Amy Benfer, "We're here! We're queer!

Emerging research suggests that gay men from religious backgrounds are likely to come out online via Facebook and Blogs as it offers a protective interpersonal distance. This largely contradicts the growing movement in social media research indicating that online use, particularly Facebook, can lead to negative mental health outcomes such as increased levels of anxiety. While further research is needed to assess whether these results generalize to a larger sample, these recent findings open the door to the possibility that gay men's online experiences may differ from heterosexuals' in that it may be more likely to provide mental health benefits than consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Etengoff, C. &amp; Daiute, C.

== Legal issues ==
{{Further|LGBT rights by country or territory}}

In areas of the world where homosexual acts are penalized or prohibited, gay men, lesbians, and bisexual people can suffer negative legal consequences for coming out. In particular, where homosexuality is a crime, coming out may constitute [[self-incrimination]]. These laws still exist in 76 countries worldwide, including Egypt, Iran, Singapore, and Afghanistan.

== Effects ==
In the early stages of the lesbian, gay or bisexual identity development process, people feel confused and experience turmoil. In 1993, [[Michelangelo Signorile]] wrote ''[[Queer in America]]'', in which he explored the harm caused both to a closeted person and to society in general by being closeted.&lt;ref&gt;re-released in 2003 by University of Wisconsin Press, {{ISBN|0-299-19374-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because LGBT people have historically been marginalized as [[Sexual minority|sexual minorities]], coming out of the closet remains a challenge for most of the world's LGBT population and can lead to a [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] of [[heterosexist]] [[discrimination]] and [[homophobic]] [[Violence against LGBT people|violence]].

On the personal and relationship levels, effects of not coming out have been the subject of studies. For example, it has been found that same-sex couples who have not come out are not as satisfied in their relationships as same-sex couples who have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2392712 |year=1990 |last1=Berger |first1=RM |title=Passing: Impact on the quality of same-sex couple relationships |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=328–32 |journal=Social work}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Findings from another study indicate that the fewer people know about a lesbian's sexual orientation, the more anxiety, less positive affectivity, and lower self-esteem she has.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9524921 |year=1998 |last1=Jordan |first1=KM |last2=Deluty |first2=RH |title=Coming out for lesbian women: Its relation to anxiety, positive affectivity, self-esteem, and social support |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=41–63 |doi=10.1300/J082v35n02_03 |journal=Journal of Homosexuality}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, Gay.com states that closeted individuals are reported to be at increased risk for [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070506131301/http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2007%2F05%2F04%2F1 Gay.com News], [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache%3AEEZU_q-zA0EJ%3Awww.smartsextalk.com%2FPDF%2F0706_suicide.pdf+%22Closeted+men+at+suicide+risk%22+%22A+recent+Australian+survey+revealed%22&amp;gl=us Study: Closeted men at suicide risk]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Cath Pope, ''Gay.com Australia'', May 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the relational bond between parents and children, a child coming out as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender can be positive or negative. Strong, loving relationships between children and their parents may be strengthened but if a relationship is already strained, those relationships may be further damaged or destroyed by the child coming out.&lt;ref name="Nielsen2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Nielsen|title=Father-Daughter Relationships: Contemporary Research and Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E0BLxVDTpOoC&amp;pg=PA256|accessdate=25 October 2012|date=4 May 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-84872-933-9|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; If people coming out are accepted by their parents, this allows open discussions of dating and relationships and allows parents to help their children with coping with discrimination and to make healthier decisions regarding [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="LamannaRiedmann2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary Ann Lamanna|author2=Agnes Riedmann|author3=Ann Strahm|title=Marriages, Families, and Relationships: Making Choices in a Diverse Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heu0KLoVVnMC&amp;pg=PA265|accessdate=25 October 2012|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-30154-5|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of studies have been done on the effect of people coming out to their parents. A 1989 report by Robinson et al. of parents of out gay and lesbian children in the United States found that 21% of fathers and 28% of mothers had suspected that their child was gay or lesbian, largely based on gender atypical behaviour during childhood. The 1989 study found that two-thirds of parents reacted negatively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=BE|author2=Walters, LH |author3=Skeen, P |title=Response of parents to learning that their child is homosexual and concern over AIDS: a national study.|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|year=1989|volume=18|issue=1-2|pages=59–80|pmid=2794499|doi=10.1300/j082v18n01_03}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A 1995 study (that used young people's reactions) found that half of the mothers of gay or bisexual male college students "responded with disbelief, denial or negative comments" while fathers reacted slightly better. 18% of parents reacted "with acts of intolerance, attempts to convert the child to heterosexuality, and verbal threats to cut off financial or emotional support".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Savin-Williams|first=Ritch|author2=Eric M.

Homelessness is a common effect among LGBT youth during the coming out process. LGBT youth are among the largest population of homeless youth; this has typically been caused by the self-identification and acknowledgment of being gay or identifying with the LGBT community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tierney|first=William G.|last2=Ward|first2=James Dean|date=2017-12|title=Coming Out and Leaving Home: A Policy and Research Agenda for LGBT Homeless Students|url=https://doi-org.libproxy.sdsu.edu/10.3102/0013189X17733964|journal=Educational Researcher|language=en|volume=46|issue=9|pages=498–507|doi=10.3102/0013189x17733964|issn=0013-189X}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 20% to 30% of homeless youth identify as LGBT.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kyu|first=Choi, Soon|last2=DM|first2=Wilson, Bianca|last3=Jama|first3=Shelton,|last4=J|first4=Gates, Gary|date=2015-06-01|title=Serving Our Youth 2015: The Needs and Experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning Youth Experiencing Homelessness|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1pd9886n|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 55% of LGBQ and 67% of transgender youth are forced out of their homes by their parents or run away because of their sexual orientation or gender identity and expression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Homelessness among LGBT youth also impacts many areas of an individual's life, leading to higher rates of victimization, depression, suicidal ideation, substance abuse, risky sexual behavior, and participation in more illegal and dangerous activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reck|first=Jen|date=2009-07-20|title=Homeless Gay and Transgender Youth of Color in San Francisco: "No One Likes Street Kids"—Even in the Castro|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19361650903013519|journal=Journal of LGBT Youth|language=en|volume=6|issue=2-3|pages=223–242|doi=10.1080/19361650903013519|issn=1936-1653}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study on homelessness pathways among Latino LGBT youth found that homelessness among LGBT individuals can also be attributed to structural issues like systems of care and sociocultural and economic factors.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castellanos|first=H.

Jimmie Manning performed a study in 2015 on positive and negative behavior performed during the coming out conversation. During his study, he learned that almost all of his participants would only attribute negative behaviors with themselves during the coming out conversations and positive behaviors with the recipient of the conversation. Manning suggests further research into this to figure out a way for positive behaviors to be seen and performed equally by both the recipient and the individual coming out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manning|first1=Jimmie|title=Positive and Negative Communicative Behaviors in Coming-out Conversations|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|date=2015|volume=62|issue=1|pages=61–97|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00918369.2014.957127#aHR0cDovL3d3dy50YW5kZm9ubGluZS5jb20vZG9pL3BkZi8xMC4xMDgwLzAwOTE4MzY5LjIwMTQuOTU3MTI3QEBAMA==|doi=10.1080/00918369.2014.957127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In/out metaphors ==

=== Dichotomy ===
The closet narrative sets up an implicit dualism between being "in" or being "out" wherein those who are "in" are often stigmatized as living false, unhappy lives.&lt;ref&gt;Seidman, Meeks, and Traschen (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, philosopher and critical analyst [[Judith Butler]] (1991) states that the ''in/out'' metaphor creates a binary opposition which pretends that the closet is dark, marginal, and false and that being out in the "light of illumination" reveals a true (or essential) identity. Nonetheless, Butler is willing to appear at events as a lesbian and maintains that "it is possible to argue that...there remains a political imperative to use these necessary errors or [[category mistake]]s...to rally and represent an oppressed political constituency".

=== Criticisms ===
In addition Diana Fuss (1991) explains, "the problem of course with the inside/outside rhetoric...is that such polemics disguise the fact that most of us are both inside and outside at the same time". Further, "To be out, in common gay parlance, is precisely to be no longer out; to be out is to be finally outside of exteriority and all the exclusions and deprivations such outsiderhood imposes. Or, put another way, to be out is really to be in—inside the realm of the visible, the speakable, the culturally intelligible." In other words, coming out constructs the closet it supposedly destroys and the self it supposedly reveals, "the first appearance of the homosexual as a 'species' rather than a 'temporary aberration' also marks the moment of the homosexual's disappearance—into the closet".

Furthermore, Seidman, Meeks, and Traschen (1999) argue that "the closet" may be becoming an antiquated metaphor in the lives of modern-day Americans for two reasons.
# Homosexuality is becoming increasingly normalized and the shame and secrecy often associated with it appears to be in decline.
# The metaphor of the closet hinges upon the notion that [[stigma management]] is a way of life.  However, stigma management may actually be increasingly done situationally.

This day was the inspiration for holding [[LGBT History Month]] in the United States in October. The day was founded in 1988, by Robert Eichberg, his partner William Gamble, and [[Jean O'Leary]] to celebrate the [[Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights]] one year earlier, in which 500,000 people marched on [[Washington, DC]], United States, for gay and lesbian equality. In the United States, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] manages the event under the National Coming Out Project, offering resources to LGBT individuals, couples, parents, and children, as well as straight friends and relatives, to promote awareness of [[LGBT parenting|LGBT families]] living honest and open lives. [[Candace Gingrich]] became the spokesperson for the day in April 1995. Although still named "''National'' Coming Out Day", it is observed in Canada, Germany, The Netherlands, and Switzerland also on October 11, and in the [[United Kingdom]] on 12 October. To celebrate National Coming Out Day on October 11, 2002, Human Rights Campaign released an album bearing the same title as that year's theme: ''[[Being Out Rocks]]''. Participating artists include [[Kevin Aviance]], [[Janis Ian]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Sarah McLachlan]], and [[Rufus Wainwright]].

==== Military personnel ====
In 1975, [[Leonard Matlovich]], while serving in the [[United States Air Force]], came out to challenge the U.S. military's policies banning service by homosexuals. Widespread coverage included a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine cover story and a television movie on [[NBC]].&lt;ref&gt;TIME: [http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19750908,00.html "I Am a Homosexual," September 8, 1975] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531205013/http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19750908,00.html |date=May 31, 2012 }}, accessed January 16, 2012;{{cite web|author= Steve Kornacki|title= The Air Force vs. the "practicing homosexual"|publisher= [[Salon.com]]|date= 2010-12-01|url= http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2010/12/01/matlovich_dadt|accessdate= 2012-01-16|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101203223214/http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2010/12/01/matlovich_dadt|archivedate= 2010-12-03|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, as the U.S. prepared to lift restrictions on service by openly gay people, Senior Airman [[Randy Phillips]] conducted a social media campaign to garner support for coming out. The video he posted on [[YouTube]] of the conversation in which he told his father he was gay went [[Viral video|viral]].&lt;ref&gt;MSNBC: [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44596987/ns/us_news-life/t/soldier-tells-dad-hes-gay-youtube/ "Soldier tells dad he's gay on YouTube," September 20, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222150534/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44596987/ns/us_news-life/t/soldier-tells-dad-hes-gay-youtube |date=December 22, 2011 }}, accessed January 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In one journalist's summation, he "masterfully used social media and good timing to place himself at the centre of a civil rights success story".&lt;ref name=guelph&gt;Guelph Mercury: [http://www.guelphmercury.com/opinion/columns/article/601322--archie-comics-storyline-has-nothing-on-randy-phillips Graeme Gerrard, "Archie Comics' storyline has nothing on Randy Phillips," September 29, 2011], accessed January 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Depictions of coming out ===
{{see also|:Category:LGBT-related coming-of-age films}}

In 1996, the acclaimed British film ''[[Beautiful Thing (film)|Beautiful Thing]]'' had a positive take in its depiction of two teenage boys coming to terms with their sexual identity. In 1987, a two-part episode of the [[Quebec]] television series ''[[Avec un grand A]]'', “Lise, Pierre et Marcel”, depicted a married closeted man who has to come out when his wife discovers that he has been having an affair with another man. In the [[Emmy Award]]-nominated episode "[[Gay Witch Hunt]]" of ''[[The Office (U.S.)|The Office]]'', Michael inadvertently outs Oscar to the whole office.

[[Ellen DeGeneres]]'s coming out in the media as well as an episode of ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'', "[[The Puppy Episode]]", "ranks, hands down, as the single most public exit in gay history", changing media portrayals of [[lesbian]]s in Western culture.&lt;ref&gt;Streitmatter, Rodger (2009). From 'Perverts' to 'Fab Five': The Media's Changing Depiction of Gay Men and Lesbians, Routledge. {{ISBN|0-7890-3670-3}}; p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, [[Russell T Davies]]'s [[Queer as Folk (UK TV series)|''Queer as Folk'']], a popular TV series shown on Channel 4 (UK) debuted and focused primarily on the lives of young gay men; in particular on a 15-year-old going through the processes of revealing his sexuality to those around him. This storyline was also featured prominently in the U.S. version of ''Queer As Folk'', which debuted in 2000.

The television show ''[[The L Word]]'', which debuted in 2004, focuses on the lives of a group of lesbian and bisexual women, and the theme of coming out is prominently featured in the storylines of multiple characters.

''[[Coming Out Serie|Coming Out]]'', which debuted in 2013, is the first [[Quebec]] television program about being gay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info-culture.biz/2013/04/02/coming-out-premiere-serie-web-sur-lunivers-gai-quebecois/|title=Coming out – Première série web sur l’univers gai québécois|work=Info-Culture.biz|accessdate=8 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014184911/http://info-culture.biz/2013/04/02/coming-out-premiere-serie-web-sur-lunivers-gai-quebecois/|archivedate=14 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Season 3 of the Norwegian Teen drama series [[Skam (TV series)|SKAM]] focused on a main character coming out and his relationship with another boy.

''[[Love, Simon]]'', based on the book, [[Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda]], debuted in 2018, and is the first major studio film about a gay teenager coming out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/love-simon-review|title=Love, Simon Is a Charming Gay Studio Movie That Makes Us Hungry for More|last=Lawson|first=Richard|work=HWD|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329221724/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/love-simon-review|archivedate=2018-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extended use in LGBT media, publishing and activism ==
"Out" is a common word or prefix used in the titles of LGBT-themed books, films, periodicals, organizations, and TV programs. Some high-profile examples are [[Out (magazine)|Out Magazine]], the defunct [[OutWeek|OutWeek Magazine]], and [[OutTV (Canada)|OutTV]].

== Non-LGBT applications ==
In political, casual, or even humorous contexts, "coming out" means by extension the self-disclosure of a person's secret behaviors, beliefs, affiliations, tastes, identities, and interests that may cause astonishment or bring [[shame]]. Some examples include: "coming out as an alcoholic",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2001/nov/03/weekend7.weekend6 |title=The show must go on |publisher=Guardian |date=2001-11-03 |accessdate=2009-06-24 |location=London |first=Louis |last=Theroux |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224171957/http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2001/nov/03/weekend7.weekend6 |archivedate=2013-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BDSM#Coming out|coming out as a BDSM participant]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clarissethorn.com/2009/02/16/coming-out-bdsm-upsides-and-downsides/|title=Coming out BDSM: upsides and downsides|work=Clarisse Thorn|accessdate=8 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20141010032330/http://clarissethorn.com/2009/02/16/coming-out-bdsm-upsides-and-downsides/|archivedate=10 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out of the broom closet" (as a [[witchcraft|witch]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2090966/ |title=How do I tell my family I'm a Wiccan? |publisher=Slate.com |date=2003-12-04 |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64qzmH4oD?url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/dear_prudence/2003/12/witch_way.html |archivedate=2012-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "coming out as a conservative",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040203-103504-2926r.htm Coming-out day for conservatives] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206100727/http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040203-103504-2926r.htm |date=February 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out as disabled",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/15528|title=Coming out as disabled - Ekklesia|work=ekklesia.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627142409/http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/15528|archivedate=2015-06-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out as a liberal",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newhampshirelakesandmountains.com/pdf/BAY.2012.08.30.pdf |title=Layout 1 (Page A1) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2017-09-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102092533/http://www.newhampshirelakesandmountains.com/pdf/BAY.2012.08.30.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out as [[intersex]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/la-radio-host-who-came-out-intersex-and-why-no-one-gossiped180713|title=The LA radio host who came out as intersex and why no one gossiped|work=Gay Star News|accessdate=8 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013081549/http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/la-radio-host-who-came-out-intersex-and-why-no-one-gossiped180713|archivedate=13 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out as [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2multiples.com/compd/ |title=COMPD&amp;nbsp;– Introduction |publisher=2multiples.com |accessdate=2009-06-24 }}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out as [[polyamory|polyamorous]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.nationalreview.com/article/380609/polyamorists-come-out-closet-celina-durgin|title=Polyamorists Come Out of the Closet - National Review Online|work=National Review Online|accessdate=8 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006085106/http://m.nationalreview.com/article/380609/polyamorists-come-out-closet-celina-durgin|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "coming out as a [[sex work]]er",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xojane.com/issues/coming-out-of-the-hooker-closet|title=What It's Like to Come Out of the Hooker Closet|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014095839/http://www.xojane.com/issues/coming-out-of-the-hooker-closet|archivedate=2014-10-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "coming out of the shadows" as an [[Illegal immigrant population of the United States|undocumented immigrant]] within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corrunker|first=Laura|date=2012-01-01|title="Coming Out of the Shadows": DREAM Act Activism in the Context of Global Anti-Deportation Activism|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/480726|journal=Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies|volume=19|issue=1|pages=143–168|issn=1543-0367|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919195021/https://muse.jhu.edu/article/480726|archivedate=2016-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used by members of online [[BIID]] communities to refer to the process of telling friends and families about their condition.

'''Diagrammatic reasoning''' is [[reasoning]] by means of [[visual]] [[depiction|representation]]s. The study of ''diagrammatic reasoning'' is about the understanding of concepts and ideas, visualized with the use of [[diagram]]s and [[image]]ry instead of by [[natural language|linguistic]] or [[algebra]]ic means.

==Diagram==
A [[diagram]] is a 2D geometric symbolic [[depiction|representation]] of [[information]] according to some [[illustration|visualization]] technique. Sometimes, the technique uses a [[3D space|3D]] visualization which is then [[3D projection|projected]] onto the 2D surface. The term diagram in common sense can have two meanings.
[[Image:Wikipedia article-creation-2.svg|thumb|250px|Sample [[flowchart]] representing the [[decision process]] to add a new article to Wikipedia.]]
* ''visual information device'': Like the term "[[illustration]]" the diagram is used as a collective term standing for the whole class of technical genres, including [[graphics|graphs]], technical drawings and [[table (information)|table]]s.&lt;ref name="LEB 03"/&gt;
* ''specific kind of visual display'': This is only the genre, that shows qualitative data with shapes that are connected by lines, arrows, or other visual links.

In science the term is used in both ways. For example, Anderson (1997) stated more general "diagrams are pictorial, yet abstract, representations of information, and [[map]]s, [[line graph]]s, [[bar chart]]s, [[engineering]] [[blueprint]]s, and [[architect]]s' [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es are all examples of diagrams, whereas photographs and video are not".&lt;ref name="MA97"&gt;Michael Anderson (1997). [http://zeus.cs.hartford.edu/~anderson/intro.html "Introduction to Diagrammatic Reasoning"]. Retrieved 21 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Lowe (1993) defined diagrams as specifically "abstract graphic portrayals of the subject matter they represent".&lt;ref name="RKL 93"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1075/idj.7.1.01low |last=Lowe |first=Richard K. |year=1993 |title=Diagrammatic information: techniques for exploring its mental representation and processing |journal=Information Design Journal |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=3–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the specific sense diagrams and charts contrast [[computer graphics]], technical illustrations, [[infographics]], maps, and [[technical drawing]]s, by showing "abstract rather than [[literal translation|literal]] representations of information".&lt;ref name="LEB 03"&gt;{{cite book |first=Lee E. |last=Brasseur |authorlink=Lee E. Brasseur |title=Visualizing technical information: a cultural critique |publisher=Baywood Pub |location=Amityville, N.Y. |year=2003 |isbn=0-89503-240-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essences of a diagram can be seen as:&lt;ref name = "LEB 03"/&gt; 
* a ''form'' of visual [[content format|format]]ting devices 
* a ''display'' that does not show [[quantitative data]], but rather relationships and abstract information 
* with ''building blocks'' such as geometrical shapes that are connected by [[wikt:line|line]]s, [[arrow]]s, or other visual links.

Or as Bert S. Hall wrote, "diagrams are simplified figures, caricatures in a way, intended to convey essential meaning".&lt;ref name="BSH96"&gt;Bert S. Hall (1996). "The Didactic and the Elegant: Some Thoughts on Scientific and Technological Illustrations in the Middle Ages and Renaissance". in: B. Braigie (ed.) ''Picturing knowledge: historical and philosophical problems concerning the use of art in science''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. p.9&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jan V. White]] (1984) "the characteristics of a good diagram are elegance, clarity, ease, pattern, simplicity, and validity".&lt;ref name="LEB 03"/&gt; Elegance for White means that what you are seeing in the diagram is "the simplest and most fitting solution to a problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=White |first=Jan V. |title=Using charts and graphs: 1000 ideas for visual persuasion |publisher=Bowker |location=New York |year=1984 |isbn=0-8352-1894-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical graph==
A [[logical graph]] is a special type of [[graph theory|graph-theoretic]] structure in any one of several systems of graphical [[syntax (logic)|syntax]] that [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] developed for [[logic]].

In his papers on ''[[qualitative logic]]'', ''[[entitative graph]]s'', and ''[[existential graph]]s'', Peirce developed several versions of a graphical [[formal system|formalism]], or a graph-theoretic [[formal language]], designed to be interpreted for logic.

In the century since Peirce initiated this line of development, a variety of formal systems have branched out from what is abstractly the same formal base of graph-theoretic structures.

===Conceptual graph===
A [[conceptual graph]] (CG) is a notation for logic based on the [[existential graph]]s of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and the [[semantic network]]s of [[artificial intelligence]]. In the first published paper on conceptual graphs, [[John F. Sowa]] used them to represent the [[conceptual schema]]s used in database systems. His first book&lt;ref&gt;John F. Sowa (1984). ''Conceptual Structures: Information Processing in Mind and Machine.'' Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; applied them to a wide range of topics in artificial intelligence, computer science, and cognitive science. A linear notation, called the ''Conceptual Graph Interchange Format (CGIF)'', has been standardized in the ISO standard for [[Common Logic]].

[[Image:Cat-on-mat.svg|thumb|250px|Elsie the cat is sitting on a mat]]
The diagram on the right is an example of the ''display form'' for a conceptual graph. Each box is called a ''concept node'', and each oval is called a ''relation node''. In CGIF, this CG would be represented by the following statement:

::[Cat Elsie] [Sitting *x] [Mat *y] (agent ?x Elsie) (location ?x ?y)

In CGIF, brackets enclose the information inside the concept nodes, and parentheses enclose the information inside the relation nodes. The letters x and y, which are called ''coreference labels'', show how the concept and relation nodes are connected. In the ''Common Logic Interchange Format (CLIF)'', those letters are mapped to variables, as in the following statement:

::(exists ((x Sitting) (y Mat)) (and (Cat Elsie) (agent x Elsie) (location x y)))

As this example shows, the asterisks on the coreference labels *x and *y in CGIF map to existentially quantified variables in CLIF, and the question marks on ?x and ?y map to bound variables in CLIF. A universal quantifier, represented ''@every*z'' in CGIF, would be represented ''forall (z)'' in CLIF.

===Entitative graph===
An [[entitative graph]] is an element of the [[graph theory|graphical]] [[syntax]] for [[logic]] that [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] developed under the name of ''qualitative logic'' beginning in the 1880s, taking the coverage of the [[formal system|formalism]] only as far as the [[propositional calculus|propositional or sentential]] aspects of logic are concerned.&lt;ref&gt;See 3.468, 4.434, and 4.564 in Peirce's ''Collected Papers''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[syntax]] is:
* The blank page;
* Single letters, phrases;
* Objects (subgraphs) enclosed by a [[simple closed curve]] called a ''cut''. A cut can be empty.

The [[semantics]] are:
* The blank page denotes ''False'';
* Letters, phrases, subgraphs, and entire graphs can be ''True''' or ''False'';
* To surround objects with a cut is equivalent to Boolean [[Complement (order theory)|complementation]]. Hence an empty cut denotes ''Truth'';
* All objects within a given cut are tacitly joined by [[disjunction]].

A "proof" manipulates a graph, using a short list of rules, until the graph is reduced to an empty cut or the blank page. A graph that can be so reduced is what is now called a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] (or the complement thereof). Graphs that cannot be simplified beyond a certain point are analogues of the [[satisfiable]] [[formula]]s of [[first-order logic]].

===Existential graph===
An [[existential graph]] is a type of [[diagram]]matic or visual notation for logical expressions, proposed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who wrote his first paper on [[logical graph|graphical logic]] in 1882 and continued to develop the method until his death in 1914. Peirce proposed three systems of existential graphs:
* ''alpha'' – [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to [[sentential logic]] and the [[two-element Boolean algebra]];
* ''beta'' – isomorphic to [[first-order logic]] with identity, with all formulas closed;
* ''gamma'' – (nearly) isomorphic to [[normal modal logic]].
''Alpha'' nests in ''beta'' and ''gamma''. ''Beta'' does not nest in ''gamma'', quantified modal logic being more than even Peirce could envisage.

[[Image:PeirceAlphaGraphs.svg|thumb|250px|Alpha Graphs]]
In ''alpha'' the [[syntax]] is:
* The blank page;
* Single letters or phrases written anywhere on the page;
* Any graph may be enclosed by a [[simple closed curve]] called a ''cut'' or ''sep''. A cut can be empty. Cuts can nest and concatenate at will, but must never intersect.

Any well-formed part of a graph is a ''subgraph''.

The [[semantics]] are:
* The blank page denotes ''Truth'';
* Letters, phrases, subgraphs, and entire graphs may be ''True'' or ''False'';
* To enclose a subgraph with a cut is equivalent to logical [[negation]] or Boolean [[Complement (order theory)|complementation]]. Hence an empty cut denotes ''False'';
* All subgraphs within a given cut are tacitly [[conjunction (logic)|conjoined]].

Hence the ''alpha'' graphs are a minimalist notation for [[sentential logic]], grounded in the expressive adequacy of ''And'' and ''Not''. The ''alpha'' graphs constitute a radical simplification of the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] and the [[connective (logic)|truth functors]].

==Characteristica universalis==
[[Characteristica universalis]], commonly interpreted as ''universal characteristic'', or ''universal character'' in English, is a universal and formal language imagined by the German philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] able to express mathematical, scientific, and metaphysical concepts. Leibniz thus hoped to create a language usable within the framework of a universal logical calculation or ''[[calculus ratiocinator]]''.

[[Image:Characteristica universalis diagram.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Leibniz's diagrammatic reasoning.]]
Since the ''characteristica universalis'' is diagrammatic and employs [[pictograms]] (below left), the diagrams in Leibniz's work warrant close study. On at least two occasions, Leibniz illustrated his philosophical reasoning with diagrams. One diagram, the frontispiece to his 1666 ''[[De Arte Combinatoria]]'' (On the Art of Combinations), represents the Aristotelian theory of how all material things are formed from combinations of the elements earth, water, air, and fire.

[[Image:LeibnizCharacters.jpg|thumb|225px|left|Basic elements of Leibniz's pictograms.]]
These four elements make up the four corners of a diamond (see picture to right). Opposing pairs of these are joined by a bar labeled "contraries" (earth-air, fire-water). At the four corners of the superimposed square are the four qualities defining the elements. Each adjacent pair of these is joined by a bar labeled "possible combination"; the diagonals joining them are labeled "impossible combination."  Starting from the top, fire is formed from the combination of dryness and heat; air from wetness and heat; water from coldness and wetness; earth from coldness and dryness.&lt;ref&gt;This diagram is reproduced in several texts including ''Saemtliche Schriften und Briefe'', Reihe VI, Band 1: 166, Loemker 1969: 83, 366, Karl Popp and Erwin Stein 2000: 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Venn-II reasoning system==
In the early 1990s [[Sun-Joo Shin]] presented an extension of Existential Graphs called Venn-II.&lt;ref&gt;Shin, Sun-Joo. 1994. The Logical Status of Diagrams. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Syntax and semantics are given formally, together with a set of ''Rules of Transformation'' which are shown to be sound and complete. Proofs proceed by applying the rules (which remove or add syntactic elements to or from diagrams) sequentially. Venn-II is equivalent in expressive power to a first-order monadic language.

'''Differentiation''' in [[semantics]] is defined by Löbner (2002) as a meaning shift reached by "adding concepts to the original concepts". His example is ''James Joyce is hard to understand'', where ''understand'' is differentiated from "perceiving the meaning" to "interpret the text meaning".

A related meaning shift is [[metonymy]], where one builds a new concept out of an element of the original concept. In the example mentioned, ''James Joyce'' most likely refers to "the work of James Joyce" and not to the author – a metonymical shift. If the name were to refer to the man, ''understand'' would be differently differentiated, perhaps one would read it as "interpret the speech articulation" or "comprehend the actions" of the person [[James Joyce]]. 

Meaning shifts are very common among language users, and allow for great flexibility of word usage. It is not to be confused with [[lexical ambiguity]] though, words as uttered in a context may have perfectly precise meanings even though in varying contexts they may be used to express widely different meanings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1445">The '''dodecahedral conjecture''' in [[geometry]] is intimately related to [[sphere packing]]. 

[[László Fejes Tóth]], a 20th-century Hungarian geometer, considered the [[Voronoi decomposition]] of any given packing of [[unit sphere]]s. He conjectured in 1943 that the minimal volume of any cell in the resulting Voronoi decomposition was at least as large as the volume of a [[regular dodecahedron]] circumscribed to a unit sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fejes Tóth |first=L. |year=1943 |title=Über die dichteste Kugellagerung |journal=[[Mathematische Zeitschrift]] |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=676–684 |doi=10.1007/BF01180035 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Callister Hales]] and [[Sean McLaughlin (mathematician)|Sean McLaughlin]] proved the conjecture in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hales |first=Thomas C. |last2=McLaughlin |first2=Sean |year=2010 |title=The Dodecahedral Conjecture |journal=[[Journal of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=299–344 |doi=10.1090/S0894-0347-09-00647-X |arxiv=math.MG/9811079 |bibcode=2010JAMS...23..299H }}.&lt;/ref&gt; following the same strategy that led Hales to his proof of the [[Kepler conjecture]]. The proofs rely on extensive computations. McLaughlin was awarded the 1999 [[Morgan Prize]] for his contribution to this proof.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2339">A '''Foreign Language Assistant''' (FLA) is an [[assistant teacher]], usually a native speaker, assisting a teacher of modern foreign languages in another country in lessons about the native language of the assistant.&lt;ref name="bc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/languageassistants-fla.htm | title=British Council - Learning | accessdate=February 15, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218161112/http://www.britishcouncil.org/languageassistants-fla.htm | archivedate=February 18, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programs are meant to be of benefit for both assistants and pupils. It should help to improve the foreign language skills of the pupils on one hand and is, on the other hand, an opportunity for the assistants to deepen their language skills and their cultural knowledge, as well as a chance to get an insight into a different educational system.&lt;ref name="bc"/&gt;

In Germany, the responsible institution behind the FLA program is the Educational Exchange Service ([[:de:Pädagogischer Austauschdienst|Pädagogischer Austauschdienst]]), which is a governmental institution of the ministers of education of the federal states in [[Germany]] that organises and arranges international exchange 	programs in education on behalf of the federal states.

==Duties==

A '''Foreign Language Assistant''' either assists teachers in their language lessons or teaches small groups on his/her own. Foreign Language Assistants have to work maximum twelve hours per week, mainly in secondary schools. Tasks vary and include conversation exercises like roleplays, providing sources and interesting information for cultural studies lessons and rehearsing exam situations. The duration of stay is usually eight to nine months.

'''Girija Prasad Joshi''' (1939–1987) was a versatile Nepalese poet who set a new trend in [[Nepal Bhasa]] literature.&lt;ref&gt;Bajracharya, Phanindra Ratna (2003). ''Who's Who in Nepal Bhasha.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. {{ISBN|99933-560-0-X}}. Page 125.&lt;/ref&gt; His poems, epics, plays and novels broke tradition and crossed conventional boundaries. He has been honored with the title Great Poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Mahakavi Girija Prasad Mhasike ("Profile of Great Poet Girija Prasad")|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=Sandhya Times|date=19 March 2012}} Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Joshi was born in [[Sankhu]] (Sakwa), a small town in the [[Kathmandu Valley]]. His father was Dev Prasad and mother Khadga Devi Joshi. After finishing high school, he earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in education and taught in various schools. In 1981, he became headmaster of Rastriya Madhyamik Vidyalaya, [[Indrayani]].&lt;ref&gt;Bajracharya, Phanindra Ratna (2003). ''Who's Who in Nepal Bhasha.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. {{ISBN|99933-560-0-X}}. Page 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==

Joshi published his first poem in ''[[Dharmodaya]]'' magazine in 1958. He has been described as being influenced by leftist views, but his works encompass a wide range of subjects from progressive to romantic.&lt;ref&gt;Bajracharya, Phanindra Ratna (2003). ''Who's Who in Nepal Bhasha.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. {{ISBN|99933-560-0-X}}. Page 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

His poems and stories speak up for the downtrodden masses. Joshi's writing career spanned the years of the repressive [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] system (1962–1990) when Nepal Bhasa writers were arrested and tortured. Writings in languages other than the [[Nepali language]] were stifled, and no new publications were allowed to be established. Against this backdrop, Joshi's works inspired literary and cultural movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrestha|first=Bal Gopal|title=The Newars: The Indigenous Population of the Kathmandu Valley in the Modern State of Nepal)|url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_26_01_04.pdf|accessdate=20 March 2012|newspaper=CNAS Journal|date=January 1999}} Pages 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

Joshi was a prolific writer. During the period 1958 to 1987, he produced 11 novels, nine books of poetry, 10 story books, two epics, two plays and four books of songs. His greatest novels are ''Siluswan'' and ''Bipatra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Mahakavi Girija Prasadya Bunhi Hanachwana ("Great Poet Girija Prasad's birth anniversary being celebrated")|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=Gorkhapatra|date=20 March 2012}} Page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''Silu-me: Cipukham'' is a well known novelette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |url=http://lccn.loc.gov/2001292379 |title=Library of Congress Catalog Record |work= |publisher=Library of Congress |date= |accessdate=20 March 2012 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem entitled ''Hakugunya Nhapanmha Gayak'' ("The First Singer of the Black Hill") is the longest poem in Nepal Bhasa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Mahakavi Girija Prasad Mhasike ("Profile of Great Poet Girija Prasad")|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=Sandhya Times|date=19 March 2012}} Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guinea-Bissau Creole''' is a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]-based [[creole language]] spoken in [[Guinea Bissau]], [[Senegal]] and [[The Gambia]]. It is also called by its native speakers as {{lang|kea|kriol}}, {{lang|kea|kiriol}}, {{lang|kea|kriolu}} or {{lang|kea|portuguis}}. 

It is a [[Portuguese-based creole languages|Portuguese-based]] [[creole language]], closely related to [[Cape Verdean Creole|Cape Verdean]] [[creole language]]. Guinea-Bissau Creole is spoken as a first creole language by approximately 15% (190,000) of Bissau-Guineans&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt; and as a second creole language by approximately 50%, as of some time before 1992,&lt;ref name="e12"/&gt;.

A dialect of Guinea-Bissau Creole is also spoken in southern [[Senegal]], mainly in the region of [[Casamance]], a former Portuguese colony, which is known as '''Portuguis Creole''' or '''Casamance Creole'''. Creole is the majority language of the inhabitants of the [[Casamance]] region and is used as a creole language of commerce.&lt;ref name=instituto-camoes&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.instituto-camoes.pt/encarte/encarte98a.htm | dead-url=yes | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000233/http://www.instituto-camoes.pt/encarte/encarte98a.htm | archive-date=2016-03-04 | title=A Língua Portuguesa no Senegal | trans-title=Portuguese language in Senegal | language=Portuguese | date=12–25 April 2006 | accessdate=10 December 2014 | author=José Horta | publisher=Instituto Camões | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guinea-Bissau Creole is still expanding but with growing interference from Portuguese ([[decreolization]]): due to television, literacy, prestige and emigration to Portugal, and the African languages: through migration of speakers of native African languages to the main urban centres where the creole is prevalent. Standard [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the official language of Guinea-Bissau, but Guinea-Bissau Creole is the creole language of trade, informal literature and entertainment. It is not used in news media, parliament, public services and educational programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.didinho.org/SIT_LING_GB_Incanha.pdf Situação Sociolinguística da Guiné-bissau] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908191757/http://www.didinho.org//SIT_LING_GB_Incanha.pdf |date=2014-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Upper Guinea creoles are the oldest Portuguese-based creoles, first appearing around the Portuguese settlements along the northwest coast of [[Africa]]. Guinea-Bissau Creole is therefore among the first Portuguese Creoles. Portuguese merchants and settlers started to mix with locals almost immediately; this became a rule among Portuguese explorers and the main reason for the large number of Portuguese Creoles throughout the world. A small body of settlers called ''[[lançados]]'' ("the thrown out ones"), contributed to the spread of the Portuguese language and influence by being the intermediaries between the Portuguese and natives.

There are three main dialects of this Creole in Guinea-Bissau and Senegal:
*Bissau and Bolama
*Bafata
*Cacheu–Ziguinchor
The Creole's substrate language is the language of the local peoples: Mandingas, [[Manjacos]], Pepéis and others, but most of the lexicon (around 80%) comes from Portuguese.

The [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]-based dialect of [[Casamance]], known as Portuguis Creole or Casamance Creole, similar to the one of Cacheu (Guinea-Bissau) has some influence of [[French language|French]]. ''{{lang|pov|Fijus di Terra}}'' ({{lang|pt|links=no|Filhos da Terra}}, English: Children of the Land) and ''{{lang|pov|Fijus di Fidalgu}}'' (Port. ''{{lang|pt|Filhos de Fidalgo}}'', Eng. Children of Nobles) speak it, all of them are known, locally, as '''''Purtuguis''''' because they adopt [[Europe]]an habits, are [[Catholic]]s and speak a Creole. They are descendants of Portuguese men and African women. Most of them have Portuguese surnames, such as ''da Silva'', ''Carvalho'' or ''Fonseca''. The former Kingdom of Casamance made a friendship alliance with the Portuguese and the local king adopted European lifestyle and there were Portuguese in his court. In 1899, the city was ceded to [[France]] and in the middle of the 20th century, the language spread to the surrounding area. After Senegal's independence from France, the Creole people were seen as friends of the French, and discrimination by the more numerous northern [[Wolof language|Wolof]] speaking community started, which has caused Casamance to struggle for independence since 1982. Today, although they continue to struggle, the movement is more placid and learning Portuguese is popular in Casamance because they see it has a link to their past. It is also learned across Senegal since the independence of the country from France.&lt;ref name=instituto-camoes/&gt; In Senegal, the Creole is the first language of at least 46,500 people (1998), it is mainly spoken in Ziguinchor but there are also speakers in other Casamance cities and in [[The Gambia]]. In 2008, Senegal was admitted as an observer country of the Portuguese-speaking commonwealth in the [[VII CPLP Summit]].

The '''Gusii language''' (also known as '''Kisii''' or '''Ekegusii''') is a [[Bantu language]] spoken in the Kisii district in western [[Kenya]], whose headquarters is [[Kisii town]], (between the Kavirondo Gulf of [[Lake Victoria]] and the border with [[Tanzania]]). It is spoken by the [[Kisii people|Gusii]] people, numbering about 2.0 million ([[SIL International|SIL]]/Ethnologue 1994). A few Gusii people are bilingual in [[Luo language|Luo]].

==Sounds==
===Vowels===
Gusii has seven vowels. [[Vowel length]] is contrastive, i.e. the words 'bór' ''to miss'' and 'bóór' ''to say'' are distinguished by vowel length only.

"'''I know that I know nothing'''" is a saying derived from [[Plato]]'s account of the [[Classical Greece|Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Socrates]]. It is also called the '''Socratic paradox'''. The phrase is not one that Socrates himself is ever recorded as saying.

This saying is also connected or conflated with the [[List of oracular statements from Delphi#440 BC|answer]] to a question Socrates (according to [[Xenophon]]) or [[Chaerephon]] (according to Plato) is said to have posed to the [[Pythia]], the [[oracle of Delphi]], in which the Oracle stated something to the effect of "Socrates is the wisest."&lt;ref&gt;H. Bowden,  ''Classical Athens and the Delphic Oracle: Divination and Democracy'', Cambridge University Press, 2005, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SoSJLj3O3tYC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=Chaerophon+asked+the+Oracle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gAw4VYOBOZXjauPTgYAK&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Chaerophon%20asked%20the%20Oracle&amp;f=false p. 82].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The phrase, originally&lt;!--see talk page section: "Original Greek"--&gt; from [[Latin]] ("''{{lang|la|ipse se nihil scire id unum sciat}}''"&lt;ref&gt;"He himself thinks he knows one thing, that he knows nothing"; [[Cicero]], ''Academica'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0032%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D16 Book I, section 16].&lt;/ref&gt;), is a possible paraphrase from a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] text (see below). It is also quoted as "''{{lang|la|scio me nihil scire}}''" or "''{{lang|la|scio me nescire}}''".&lt;ref&gt;A variant is found in [[Nicholas of Cusa|von Kues]], ''De visione Dei'', XIII, 146 (''Werke'', Walter de Gruyter, 1967, p. 312): "''...et hoc scio solum, quia scio me nescire {{sic}}...'' [I know alone, that (''or'' because) I know, that I do not know]."&lt;/ref&gt; It was later [[Back-translation|back-translated]]&lt;!--see talk page section: "Original Greek"--&gt; to [[Katharevousa Greek]] as "{{lang|grc|[ἓν οἶδα ὅτι] οὐδὲν οἶδα}}", [''èn oîda óti''] ''oudèn oîda'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.translatum.gr/forum/index.php?topic=918.0 Translatum: The Greek Translation Vortal – Topic: All I know is that I know nothing]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Plato ==
The saying, though widely attributed to Plato's Socrates in both ancient and modern times, actually occurs nowhere in Plato's works in this form.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Fine, "Does Socrates Claim to Know that He Knows Nothing?", ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy'' vol. 35 (2008), pp. 49–88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two prominent Plato scholars have recently argued that the claim should not be attributed to Plato's Socrates.&lt;ref&gt;Fine argues that "it is better not to attribute it to him" ("Does Socrates Claim to Know that He Knows Nothing?", ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy'' vol. 35 (2008), p. 51). C. C. W. Taylor has argued that the "paradoxical formulation is a clear misreading of Plato" (''Socrates'', Oxford University Press 1998, p. 46).&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence that Socrates does not actually claim to know nothing can be found at ''Apology'' 29b-c, where he claims twice to know something. See also ''Apology'' 29d, where Socrates indicates that he is so confident in his claim to knowledge at 29b-c that he is willing to die for it.

In ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology]]'', Plato relates that Socrates accounts for his seeming wiser than any other person because he does not imagine that he knows what he does not know.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Plato, ''Apology'' 21d.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{lang|grc|[…] ἔοικα γοῦν τούτου γε σμικρῷ τινι αὐτῷ τούτῳ σοφώτερος εἶναι, ὅτι ἃ μὴ οἶδα οὐδὲ οἴομαι εἰδέναι.}}
&lt;br&gt;[…] I seem, then, in just this little thing to be wiser than this man at any rate, that what I do not know I do not think I know either.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The context in which this passage occurs should be considered; Socrates having gone to a "wise" man, and having discussed with him, withdraws and thinks the above to himself. Socrates, since he denied any kind of knowledge, then tried to find someone wiser than himself among politicians, poets, and craftsmen. It appeared that politicians claimed wisdom without knowledge; poets could touch people with their words, but did not know their meaning; and craftsmen could claim knowledge only in specific and narrow fields. The interpretation of the Oracle's answer might be Socrates' awareness of his own ignorance.&lt;ref name="PlatoKaplan2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Plato|author2=Morris Kaplan|title=The Socratic Dialogues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSous9E-3CwC&amp;pg=PR9|date=2009|publisher=Kaplan Publishing|isbn=978-1-4277-9953-1|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates also deals with this phrase in Plato's dialogue ''[[Meno]]'' when he says:&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Meno'' 80d1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{lang|grc|καὶ νῦν περὶ ἀρετῆς ὃ ἔστιν ἐγὼ μὲν οὐκ οἶδα, σὺ μέντοι ἴσως πρότερον μὲν ᾔδησθα πρὶν ἐμοῦ ἅψασθαι, νῦν μέντοι ὅμοιος εἶ οὐκ εἰδότι.}}
&lt;br&gt;[So now I do not know what virtue is; perhaps you knew before you contacted me, but now you are certainly like one who does not know.] (trans. [[George Grube|G. M. A. Grube]])
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, Socrates aims at the change of Meno's opinion, who was a firm believer in his own opinion and whose claim to knowledge Socrates had disproved.

It is essentially the question that begins "[[Pre-Socratic|post-Socratic]]" Western philosophy. Socrates begins all wisdom with wondering, thus one must begin with admitting one's ignorance. After all, Socrates' dialectic method of teaching was based on that he as a teacher knew nothing, so he would derive knowledge from his students by dialogue.

There is also a passage by [[Diogenes Laertius]] in his work ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'' where he lists, among the things that Socrates used to say:&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius II.32.&lt;/ref&gt; "{{lang|grc|εἰδέναι μὲν μηδὲν πλὴν αὐτὸ τοῦτο εἰδέναι}}", or "that he knew nothing except that he knew that very fact (i.e. that he knew nothing)".

Again, closer to the quote, there is a passage in Plato's ''Apology'', where Socrates says that after discussing with someone he started thinking that:&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{lang|grc|τούτου μὲν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐγὼ σοφώτερός εἰμι· κινδυνεύει μὲν γὰρ ἡμῶν οὐδέτερος οὐδὲν καλὸν κἀγαθὸν εἰδέναι, ἀλλ᾽ οὗτος μὲν οἴεταί τι εἰδέναι οὐκ εἰδώς, ἐγὼ δέ, ὥσπερ οὖν οὐκ οἶδα, οὐδὲ οἴομαι· ἔοικα γοῦν τούτου γε σμικρῷ τινι αὐτῷ τούτῳ σοφώτερος εἶναι, ὅτι ἃ μὴ οἶδα οὐδὲ οἴομαι εἰδέναι.}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am wiser than this man, for neither of us appears to know anything great and good; but he fancies he knows something, although he knows nothing; whereas I, as I do not know anything, so I do not fancy I do. In this trifling particular, then, I appear to be wiser than he, because I do not fancy I know what I do not know.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Alternative usage ==
"Socratic paradox" may also refer to statements of Socrates that seem contrary to common sense, such as that "no one desires evil"&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Irwin]], ''The Development of Ethics'', vol. 1, Oxford University Press 2007, p. 14; Gerasimos Santas, "The Socratic Paradoxes", ''Philosophical Review'' 73 (1964), pp. 147–64.&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Socrates#Socratic paradoxes|Socratic paradoxes]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10221">'''International scientific vocabulary''' ('''ISV''') comprises scientific and specialized words whose language of origin may or may not be certain, but which are in current use in several modern languages (that is, [[translingualism|translingually]]). The name "International Scientific Vocabulary" was first used by Philip Gove in ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Webster’s Third New International Dictionary]]'' (1961).&lt;ref&gt;McArthur, Tom (editor), ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language.'' Oxford University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Crystal,&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David, ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language.'' Cambridge University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; science is an especially productive field for new coinages.

==Instances==
According to ''Webster's Third'', "some ISV words (like [[haploid]]) have been created by taking a word with a rather general and simple meaning from one of the languages of antiquity, usually [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]], and conferring upon it a very specific and complicated meaning for the purposes of modern [[scientific]] discourse." An ISV word is typically a [[classical compound]] or a derivative which "gets only its raw materials, so to speak, from antiquity." Its morphology may vary across languages.

The online version of Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (Merriam-Webster, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;The online version is available by subscription.&lt;/ref&gt; adds that the ISV "consists of words or other linguistic forms current in two or more languages" that "differ from [[New Latin]] in being adapted to the structure of the individual languages in which they appear."&lt;ref&gt;"International scientific vocabulary." [http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged. Merriam-Webster, 2002.]  Accessed July 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, ISV terms are often made with Greek, Latin, or other [[combining form]]s, but each language pronounces the resulting neo-lexemes [[Hobson-Jobson#Law of Hobson-Jobson|within its own phonemic "comfort zone"]], and makes morphological connections using its normal morphological system. In this respect ISV can be viewed as heavily borrowing [[loanword]]s from [[New Latin]]. 

McArthur&lt;ref&gt;McArthur, Tom, [http://kdictionaries.com/lia-intro.html "Asian Lexicography: Past, Present, and Prospective", ''Lexicography in Asia'' (Introduction). Password Publishers Limited, 1998.] Accessed January 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; characterizes ISV words and morphemes as "[[International word|translinguistic]]", explaining that they operate "in many languages that serve as mediums for education, culture, science, and technology." Besides European languages, such as Russian, Swedish, English, and Spanish, ISV lexical items also function in Japanese, Malay, Philippine languages, and other Asian languages. According to McArthur, no other set of words and morphemes is so international.

The ISV is one of the concepts behind the development and standardization of the [[constructed language]] called [[Interlingua]]. Scientific and medical terms in Interlingua are largely of Greco-Latin origin, but, like most Interlingua words, they appear in a wide range of languages. Interlingua's vocabulary is established using a group of ''control languages'' selected because they radiate words into, and absorb words from, a large number of other languages. A ''prototyping'' technique then selects the most recent common ancestor of each eligible Interlingua word or affix. The word or affix takes a contemporary form based on the control languages. This procedure is meant to give Interlingua the most generally international vocabulary possible.&lt;ref&gt;Gode, Alexander, ''[[Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua: A Dictionary of the International Language]]''. New York: Storm Publishers, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other differences==
Another difference between scientific terms and classical Latin and Greek is that many compounded scientific terms do not [[elision|elide]] the [[inflection]] vowel at the end of a [[root (linguistics)|root]] before another root or prefix that starts with a vowel, e.g. [[gastroenteritis|gastr'''o'''enteritis]]; but elision happens in [[gastrectomy]] (not gastroectomy).

The Greek word τέρας (τέρατο-) = "[[monster]]" is usually used to mean "monster (abnormal)" (e.g. [[teratology]], [[teratogen]]), but some biological names use it to mean "monster (enormous)" (e.g. the extinct animals ''[[Teratornis]]'' (a [[condor]] with a 12-foot wingspan) and ''[[Terataspis]]'' (a [[trilobite]] 2 feet long)).

The '''Kam language''', also known as '''Gam''' ([[Endonym|autonym]]: ''lix Gaeml''), or in Chinese, ''Dong'' or ''Tung-Chia'', is a [[Kam–Sui languages|Kam–Sui]] language spoken by the [[Dong people]]. ''[[Ethnologue]]'' distinguishes three Kam varieties as separate but closely related languages.&lt;ref name=e16/&gt;

==Dialects==
The Kam language can be divided into two major subdivisions, Southern Kam and Northern Kam (Yang &amp; Edmondson 2008).&lt;ref name="TK"&gt;Yang Tongyin and Jerold A. Edmondson (2008). "Kam." In Diller, Anthony, Jerold A. Edmondson, and Yongxian Luo ed. ''The Tai–Kadai Languages''. Routledge Language Family Series. Psychology Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Kam displays more Chinese influence and lacks vowel length contrast, while Southern Kam is more conservative. Language varieties closely related to or part of Kam include [[Cao Miao language|Cao Miao]] and [[Naxi Yao language|Naxi Yao]]. A northern [[Pinghua]] variety called [[Tongdao Pinghua]], spoken in Tongdao County, Hunan, has also been significantly influenced by Kam.

In [[Congjiang County]], Dong consists of three dialects: ''Jiudong '' {{lang|zh|九洞}} (similar to Chejiang {{lang|zh|车江}} Dong), ''Liudong'' {{lang|zh|六洞}} (similar to Liping {{lang|zh|黎平}} Dong), and another dialect spoken in Xishan {{lang|zh|西山}}, Bingmei {{lang|zh|丙梅}}, and Guandong {{lang|zh|贯洞}} (similar to Sanjiang {{lang|zh|三江}} Dong) (''Congjiang County Almanac'' 1999:109).

In [[Suining County, Hunan|Suining County]], [[Yao people#Hunan|Hunan]], Dong is spoken in Lianfeng {{lang|zh|联丰}} (including Duolong {{lang|zh|多龙村}}), Huangsangping {{lang|zh|黄桑坪}}, Le'anpu {{lang|zh|乐安铺}}, and other nearby locations.&lt;ref&gt;''Suining County Almanac'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Chengbu Miao Autonomous County|Chengbu County]], Hunan, Dong is spoken in Yanzhai {{lang|zh|岩寨}}, Chang'anying {{lang|zh|长安营}}, and Jiangtousi {{lang|zh|江头司}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Shaoyang Prefecture Almanac'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

Kam is also spoken in the single village of Đồng Mộc, Trung Sơn Commune, [[Yên Sơn District]], [[Tuyên Quang Province]], northern Vietnam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danviet.vn/que-nha/nguoi-tong-o-dong-moc/112705p1c29.htm|title=Những hương vị thân thương gần gũi ở quê nhà mà không nơi nào có|first=|last=danviet.vn|date=|website=danviet.vn|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where there are about 35 Kam people (Edmondson &amp; Gregerson 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, J.A. and Gregerson, K.J. 2001, "Four Languages of the Vietnam-China Borderlands", in ''Papers from the Sixth Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society'', ed. K.L. Adams and T.J. Hudak, Tempe, Arizona, pp. 101-133. Arizona State University, Program for Southeast Asian Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; The Kam of Đồng Mộc had migrated to Vietnam from China about 150 years ago. The Kam variety spoken in Đồng Mộc is most similar to that of Lípíng Shuǐkǒu ({{lang|zh|黎平县水口镇}}) in southeastern [[Guizhou]], China.

In China, a total of six counties designated as Dong Autonomous Counties ({{lang|zh|侗族自治县}}).
*[[Yuping Dong Autonomous County]], [[Guizhou]]
*[[Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County]], [[Guangxi]]
*[[Xinhuang Dong Autonomous County]], [[Hunan]]
*[[Zhijiang Dong Autonomous County]], [[Hunan]]
*[[Jingzhou Miao and Dong Autonomous County]], [[Hunan]]
*[[Tongdao Dong Autonomous County]], [[Hunan]]

===Others===
{{see|Naxi Yao language}}
According to the ''Shaoyang Prefecture Gazetteer'' (1997), language varieties closely related to Southern Kam are spoken in Naxi {{lang|zh|那溪}}, [[Dongkou County]] (which had 4,280 ethnic Yao in 1982 (Chen 2013:39)) and Lianmin {{lang|zh|联民}}, [[Suining County, Hunan|Suining County]]. However, they are officially classified by the Chinese government as ethnic [[Yao people|Yao]], not [[Dong people|Dong]]. Chen Qiguang (2013:39)&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Qiguang [{{lang|zh|陈其光}}] (2013). ''Miao and Yao language'' [{{lang|zh|苗瑶语文}}]. Beijing: China Minzu University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; reports that the ancestors of ''Naxihua'' {{lang|zh|那溪话}} speakers had migrated to their current location from Tianzhu, Liping, and Yuping counties of southeastern Guizhou during the early 15th century.

'''[[Sanqiao language|Sanqiao]] 三锹''' (三橇) is a [[mixed language|mixed]] Dong–[[Hmu language|Miao]] language spoken in [[Liping County]] and [[Jinping County, Guizhou|Jinping County]], [[Guizhou]], China by about 6,000 people.&lt;ref name="Yu2017"&gt;Yu Dazhong [余达忠]. 2017.

The phonetic value of the [[vowel]] in the finals spelled ''-ab'', ''-ad'' and ''-ag'', is {{IPA|[ɐ]}} in syllables that have the tones ''-l'', ''-p'' and ''-c'' (see table below); in syllables with tones ''-s'', ''-t'' and ''-x'', it is {{IPA|[a]}}. The phonetic value of the vowel in the finals spelled ''-eb'', ''-ed'' and ''-eg'', is {{IPA|[ə]}} in syllables that have the tones ''-l'', ''-p'' and ''-c''; in syllables with tones ''-s'', ''-t'' and ''-x'', it is {{IPA|[e]}}.

===Tones===
Kam is a [[tonal language]]. Open syllables can occur in one of nine different tones, checked syllables in six tones (so-called [[entering tone]]s), so that the traditional approach counts fifteen tones. As with the [[Romanized Popular Alphabet|Hmong alphabet]], the orthography marks tones with a consonant at the end of each syllable.

'''Kresh''', also known as '''Kresh-Ndogo''' and '''Gbaya-Ndogo''', is a [[Central Sudanic language]] of [[South Sudan]] and the [[prestige variety]] of the [[Kresh languages]].

The Kresh languages are not mutually intelligible. 'Kresh' is what the people are called by their neighbors; they call themselves '''Gbaya''', an ambiguous name in English, shared with many of the unrelated [[Gbaya languages]]. [[Naomi Baki]], A native Kresh speaker who became a French citizen in 2015, has released an autobiography in 2013 in which she describes her Kresh Gbaya environment in Raga County.&lt;ref&gt;[[Naomi Baki]], '[https://www.amazon.ca/suis-encore-vivante-Naomi-Baki/dp/2204101079 'Je suis encore vivante''] (Paris, Le Cerf, 2013). The title's meaning in English is "Still Alive".&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Portal|Christianity}}
The '''Lausanne Covenant''' is a July 1974 religious [[manifesto]] promoting active worldwide [[Christianity|Christian]] [[evangelism]].{{sfn|Melton|2005b}} One of the most influential documents in modern [[evangelicalism]],{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} it was written at the [[First International Congress on World Evangelization]] in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, where it was adopted by 2,300 evangelicals in attendance.{{sfnm |1a1=Melton |1y=2005a |1p=295 |2a1=Melton |2y=2005b}}

The original Lausanne conference brought together approximately 2,700 Christian religious leaders from over 150 countries and was called by a committee headed by the American evangelist [[Billy Graham]].{{sfn|Onyinah|2014|p=419}} The drafting committee for the 15-point document was chaired by [[John Stott]] of the United Kingdom.{{sfnm |1a1=Melton |1a2=Baumann |1y=2010 |1p=1695 |2a1=Padilla |2y=2010 |2p=6}} In addition to the signing of the covenant, the conference also created the [[Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The covenant is in the form of an [[ecumenical]] [[confession (religion)|confession]],{{sfn|Stott|2009|p=6}} in which the signatories profess their shame at having failed to spread the [[Gospel]] of [[Jesus]].{{sfn|Howard|2011|p=217}} The covenant specifically affirms the beliefs in the [[Nicene Creed]]. The signatories express their intention to be more committed to spreading Christianity throughout the world.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The original document is in English and has been translated into at least twenty different languages. In 1989, fifteen years after the original Lausanne conference, the [[Second International Congress on World Evangelization]] (sometimes called "Lausanne II") convened in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], and adopted the [[Manila Manifesto]], an elaboration of the Lausanne Covenant.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The introduction of the covenant is:
{{quote|We, members of the Church of Jesus Christ, from more than 150 nations, participants in the International Congress on World Evangelization at Lausanne, praise [[God]] for his great salvation and rejoice in the fellowship he has given us with himself and with each other. We are deeply stirred by what God is doing in our day, moved to penitence by our failures, and challenged by the unfinished task of evangelization. We believe the gospel is God's good news for the whole world, and we are determined, by his grace, to obey Christ's commission to proclaim it to all mankind and to make disciples of every nation. We desire, therefore, to affirm our faith and our resolve, and to make public our covenant.{{sfn|Stott|2009|p=11}}}}

'''Sarah Rebecca Rachel Leah Horowitz''' (1715?–1790?), known as '''Leah Horowitz''', was a rabbinic and kabbalistic scholar, who wrote in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]].&lt;ref&gt;''Voices of the Matriarchs: Listening to the Prayers of Early Modern Jewish Women,'' Chava Weissler, Beacon Press, 1999, p. iv.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the author of [[Tkhinne imohes]] (Supplication of the Matriarchs).&lt;ref name="JWIHP"&gt;{{cite book |title= Jewish women in historical perspective|last= Baskin |first= Judith Reesa|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 1998|publisher= Wayne State University Press|location= |isbn= |page= 180 |pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ASw5HwZrMNYC&amp;pg=PA179 |accessdate= 2009-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lived in [[Bolekhiv|Bolechów]], [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;''Voices of the Matriarchs: Listening to the Prayers of Early Modern Jewish Women,'' Chava Weissler, Beacon Press, 1999, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Horowitz was the daughter of Jacob Yokl ben Meir Ha-Levi Horowitz (1680–1755) and Reyzel bat Heshl. Her father was a member of the famed [[Synagogue|kloiz]] of [[Brody]]. Horowitz was one of some seven children. Three of her brothers were [[rabbi]]s, of whom the most eminent was Isaac (known as "[[Itsikl Hamburger]]", 1715–1767), rabbi of [[Hamburg]], [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], and [[Wandsbek]]. There was also a sister, named Pessil. There is some doubt about the identity of another brother and sister. As the sister of eminent brothers, Leah disproves the old [[Hoax|canard]] that the only educated women in her time were the daughters of learned rabbis who had no sons.

Leah's early life was spent in Bolechów, in Polish [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (now [[Bolekhiv]], [[Ukraine]]), where her father was the rabbi. When he became rabbi of Brody in 1735, his son Mordecai succeeded him as rabbi of Bolechów. Leah remained in Bolechów, continuing to live as a young married woman in the home of her brother. Her husband at this time was Aryeh Leib, son of the rabbi of [[Dobromyl]], Ukraine; later she was married to Shabbetai ben Benjamin ha-Cohen Rappoport, rabbi of [[Krasny, Russia]]. It is unknown whether she had any children.

===Scholarly work===
Even as a young, Leah was renowned for her exceptional learning. In an era when many women did not learn to read, and those who did rarely learned more than the rudiments of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], Horowitz studied the [[Talmud]] with commentaries and also read some [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] works. The memoirist Ber of Bolechów reports that when he was a boy of twelve, Leah helped him prepare for his Talmud lesson with her brother, the rabbi Mordecai. "She would begin to recite the words of Talmud or Rashi by heart, in clear language, explaining it well as it was written there, and I learned from her words. And when the rabbi awoke from his sleep, I knew how to explain the passage in the Talmud to him properly." In the same passage, Ber refers to her as "the learned and famous Mistress Leah, of blessed memory". Other authors also knew of her reputation for learning. The anonymous work Sefer Ozar Sihot Hakhamim describes her as "a great scholar, well-versed in the Talmud" and recounts her Talmudic discussion with another learned lady, Dinah, the wife of Saul Halevi (chief rabbi of [[The Hague]] from 1748 to 1785).

Although very few Eastern European Jewish women before the nineteenth century have left writings, Leah was the author of the Tkhinne of the Matriarchs, an eight-page, trilingual prayer for the Sabbath before the New Moon. (As is often the case, the place and date of publication are not mentioned in most of the printed editions.) The work contains a Hebrew introduction, a [[piyyut]] (a liturgical poem) in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], and a Yiddish prose paraphrase of the poem. This text, which has historical importance as one of the few extant works written by an eighteenth-century Eastern European Jewish woman, testifies that its author was far more learned than the norm. (Another work, Tkhinne Moyde Ani, has been erroneously attributed to her.)

Leah Horowitz was passionately concerned with the religious place and role of Jewish women and she was keenly aware of her own anomalous status as a learned woman. She addressed these issues explicitly in the Hebrew introduction to her tkhinne, and by implication in the Aramaic piyyut and the Yiddish paraphrase. Leah was concerned to establish the legitimacy of her own involvement in "Torah study", that is, in Talmudic and [[Halakha|halakhic]] discussion. Furthermore, this is perhaps the only pre-modern text in which an [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]] woman discusses the significance of women's prayer, the proper way for women to pray and the circumstances under which women should and should not submit to their husbands' authority. However, Leah's arguments were largely lost to her contemporaries. After the first few editions, the Hebrew introduction and the Aramaic piyyut were no longer printed, leaving only the Yiddish portion of the text. Presumably, most women could not read Hebrew or Aramaic, while most men were not interested in reading a tkhinne by a woman, even if a portion of it was in the [[Hebrew language|Holy Tongue]].

Nonetheless, in her Hebrew introduction Leah argues that women's prayer has the power to bring the messianic redemption if women learn to pray "properly". She states further that because women's prayer can bring the redemption, women should pray in synagogue every day, morning and evening, and she laments the fact that this is not the practice in her day. Leah has a kabbalistic understanding of prayer: true prayer is not for human needs, but for the reunification of the sundered [[sephirot]] (divine attributes) of [[Tiferet]] and [[Shekhinah]]. Because most women have little knowledge of mystical literature and concepts, Leah's purpose in writing this text is to teach women without specialized knowledge how to pray properly, that is, for the sake of the redemption of the Shekhinah from her exile, with weeping. Following kabbalistic sources, Leah attributes great power to tears.

Elaborating on what was already a focus of women's piety, the blessing of the new moon in synagogues, she provides a framework that she believed could bring redemption. In the Yiddish portion of her text (accessible to her female readers), Leah laments the bitterness of the exile and names the New Moon as a time of favor. The protection of each of the four biblical matriarchs is invoked. The central model she presents is the midrashic trope of the children of Israel going into exile, weeping at [[Rachel]]'s grave. Rachel, a common symbol for the Shekhinah, then entreats the Holy Blessed One (Tiferet), with tears, to redeem the [[Israelites]] from their exile. He is so moved by her plea that He agrees to bring the redemption. Leah suggests that women in her day should follow the example of the children of Israel, and of "our faithful Mother Rachel". Together with Leah's images of the other matriarchs, her Yiddish tkhinne, like her introduction, combines an appreciation of women's traditional roles with an assertion that women have far more spiritual power than is usually recognized.

'''LoCos''' is a [[pictorial language]] developed by [[Yukio Ota]] of [[Japan]] in 1964. It was meant as communication for the deaf and mute as well as for the [[illiterate]]. It is a universal and simple language, and as Mr.Ota put it, "It should emphasize the importance of communication among all the people of all the countries of the world."

==Symbols==
There are 8 major symbols in LoCos. There is the Sun or day, represented by a circle. There is man, represented by a ring shape. There is a thing, represented by a square. There is thought, represented by a triangle with a slightly cut off top. There is feeling, represented by a heart. There is land or place, represented by a low straight line. There the [[question]] indicator, a question mark. There is, lastly, a point or existence, represented by a single point.

==Words==
Words are made by combining different symbols in different ways. For example if you put a dot inside a circle it will represent today, or if you put a fish in a ring shape it will be a fisherman. There an around 80 words that are official according to [[Yukio Ota]]. Words can be created as long as they follow the basic word [[syntax]].

==Sentences==
Sentences are formed by a combination of certain words. There are three rows that you use when writing sentences. The middle row is used for the core words ([[nouns]], [[verbs]], and direct/indirect objects). The top row is used to modify verbs with adverbs. The bottom row is used to modify nouns using [[adjectives]].

'''M. R. Akhtar Mukul''' (1929–2004) was a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] writer and journalist from Bangladesh;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 June 2004 |title=BANGLADESH: MR Akhtar Mukul passes away |url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article-southasia.asp?parentid=12395 |deadurl= |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307183228/http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article-southasia.asp?parentid=12395 |archivedate=7 March 2012 |accessdate=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; earned fame for Chorompotro, a radio program from [[Shwadhin Bangla Betar Kendra]].

== Chorompotro ==
Mukul started the program from the clandestine [[Shwadhin Bangla Betar Kendra]], the Radio Station run by the  Bangladesh Government in Exile in India during the liberation war in 1971 (25 March-16 December) against [[Pakistan]]i armed forces.

''Chorompotra'', meaning 'the ultimate mail', or an 'ultimatum' was the radio program. Between 25 May and 16 December 1971 Mukul broadcast the feature in 117 episodes in 206 days.  In ''Chorompotra'', Mukul used a dramatically funny voice and caricatured the positions of the military President of Pakistan Yahya Khan, the members of his government, his civilian allies like Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, his governors in occupied Bangladesh, army generals and soldiers as well as Pakistan's international allies including the USA and China.  His language was full of verbal insults. In his offensive language, he used various Bengali dialects of Bangladesh as well as songs and proverbs, folk stories and jokes; and the program found popularity amongst all Bengalees including the freedom fighters, the Bengalee refugees in India as well as the general population in both occupied Bangladesh and West Bengal in India.  The broadcasts remained anonymous until the final episode and the final words where he disclosed his name.

Chorompotra turned out not to be popular with the authorities in Bangladesh after the liberation and its tapes and scripts stored in the vault of the state radio station were burnt after a change of government in 1975. It was only in 2000 that Chorompotro was printed and published as a collection by Mukul himself.

Between 1960 and 2000, Mukul authored thirty more books on subjects like the liberation war and the Bengali language movement of 1952.

Mukul in his youth was involved with the leftist political movement and later aligned himself with the Bengali nationalist movement led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He was later a career journalist and worked as a local reporter for the news agency UPI.  After independence, he became the head of the Bangladesh Radio and moved to a diplomatic career. Following the massacre of President Sheikh Mujib and his family in Dhaka, he lost the job at the Bangladesh High Commission in London and spent years in self-imposed exile in England. In order to survive with his family, he took a laboring job in the garment industry in East London. After his eventual return to Bangladesh and a brief government job, he opened a bookshop in Dhaka and concentrated in writing and publishing his books.

'''Mokilko''', or '''Mukulu''' (also known as  Gergiko, Guerguiko, Mokulu, Mokoulou, Djonkor Guera, Dyongor Guera, Diongor Guera, Jonkor-Gera), is a [[Chadic language]] spoken in central [[Chad]]. The local name for the language is Gergiko (or Geurguiko in the French orthography). This is the name used for mother-tongue literacy materials.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; Mukulu is the name of a village.

The '''Nemadi''' are small hunting tribe of eastern [[Mauritania]]. Their language is according to some sources a dialect of [[Hassaniya Arabic|Hassaniyya]], according to others a mixture of [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]], [[Soninke language|Soninke]] and Hassaniyya.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Moseley, ''Encyclopedia of the World's Endangered Languages'',  Routledge, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-7007-1197-0}} p. 623: No data exists on this language. It is not unlikely that the language can be linked to Azer, Zenaga, Soninke and/or Hassaniya&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muriel Devey, ''La Mauritanie'', KARTHALA Editions, 2005 {{ISBN|978-2-84586-583-9}}, p.39: "leur langue est un mélange d'hassaniya, de zenaga et d'azer"&lt;/ref&gt;  The name "Nemadi" itself appears to come from Soninke, where it means "master of dogs".

==Accounts of the language==
According to [[Robert Arnaud]] (1906), "around [[Tichit]] the Nemadi employ a dialect called Azeïr which is close to Soninke."  Chudeau (1913), perhaps following him, adds that "We have little information on their language, which [[Maurice Delafosse|M. Delafosse]] classifies provisionally with Soninké." However, Brosset (1932) says that they speak Hassaniyya, and that "their special vocabulary does not consist of vocables different from Hassaniyya, but of technical terms which need has forced them to create, which are forged from [[Arabic]], [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]], and maybe [[Soninke language|Azer]]."

[[Ech Chinguetti]]'s ''Kitab El Wasit'' says that "The Nmadi speak the dialect common to all the [[Moors]] (i.e. Hassaniyya).  However, they do not pronounce the final ''m'' of the affixed second person plural pronoun, so they say: ''as-Salam alayku'' ("peace be upon you") for ''alaikum'', and ''kayfa haluku'' ("how are you?") for ''halukum''."{{cn|date=March 2017}}

Laforgue claims that they speak "[[Zenati languages|Zenati]]", i.e. [[Berber languages|Berber]], a claim seen by Hermans as "very improbable".{{cn|date=March 2017}}

According to Gerteiny (1967), they speak "their own dialect, probably a mixture of Azêr [Soninke], Zenaga, and Hassaniyya, called ''Ikôku'' by the Moors.  They express themselves in brief idiomatic phrases, and the language has neither singular nor plural."{{cn|date=March 2017}}

The [[Ethnologue]]'s former description of their language appears to be based solely on this source.&lt;ref&gt;Nemadi entry in the [http://www.christusrex.org/www1/pater/ethno/Mali.html Languages of Mali], 13th edition (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Later editions say that "The Nemadi (Ikoku) are an ethnic group of 200 (1967) that speak Hassaniyya, but they have special morphemes for dogs, hunting, and houses".&lt;ref name=e18/&gt;

Hermans' opinion is that "the language spoken by the Nemadi in general (there may remain some Azer-speaking Nemadi) is Hassaniyya. But one must recognize certain peculiarities", including the lack of plural, certain [[argot]]-like expressions (cf. Fondacci), and the technical terms (cf. Brosset, Fondacci, Gabus.){{cn|date=March 2017}}

'''Noisy text analytics''' is a process of [[information extraction]] whose goal is to automatically extract structured or semistructured information from [[noisy text|noisy unstructured text data]]. While [[Text analytics]] is a growing and mature field that has great value because of the huge amounts of data being produced, processing of noisy text is gaining in importance because a lot of common applications produce noisy text data. Noisy unstructured text data is found in informal settings such as [[online chat]], [[Text messaging|text messages]], [[e-mail]]s, [[message boards]], [[newsgroups]], [[blogs]], [[wikis]] and [[web pages]]. Also, text produced by processing spontaneous speech using [[automatic speech recognition]] and printed or handwritten text using [[optical character recognition]] contains processing noise. Text produced under such circumstances is typically highly noisy containing spelling errors, [[abbreviation]]s, non-standard words, false starts, repetitions, missing [[punctuation]]s, missing [[letter case]] information, pause filling words such as “um” and “uh” and other texting and [[speech disfluencies]]. Such text can be seen in large amounts in [[contact centre (business)|contact centers]], [[chat room]]s, [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) of text documents, [[short message service]] (SMS) text, etc. Documents with [[historical language]] can also be considered noisy with respect to today’s knowledge about the language. Such text contains important historical, religious, ancient medical knowledge that is useful. The nature of the noisy text produced in all these contexts warrants moving beyond traditional text analysis techniques.

== Techniques for noisy text analysis ==
Missing punctuation and the use of non-standard words can often hinder standard [[natural language processing]] tools such as [[part-of-speech tagging]]
and [[parsing]]. Techniques to both learn from the noisy data and then to be able to process the noisy data are only now being developed.

== Possible source of noisy text ==
* [[World wide web]]: Poorly written text is found in web pages, [[online chat]], [[blogs]], [[wikis]], [[discussion forum]]s, [[newsgroups]]. Most of these data are unstructured and the style of writing is very different from, say, well-written news articles. Analysis for the web data is important because they are sources for market buzz analysis, market review, [[trend estimation]], etc. Also, because of the large amount of data, it is necessary to find efficient methods of [[information extraction]], [[Statistical classification|classification]], [[automatic summarization]] and analysis of these data.
* [[Contact centre (business)|Contact centers]]: This is a general term for help desks, information lines and customer service centers operating in domains ranging from computer sales and support to mobile phones to apparels. On an average a person in the developed world interacts at least once a week with a contact center agent. A typical contact center agent handles over a hundred calls per day. They operate in various modes such as voice, [[online chat]] and [[E-mail]]. The contact center industry produces gigabytes of data in the form of [[E-mails]], chat logs, voice conversation [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]]s, customer feedback, etc. A bulk of the contact center data is voice conversations. Transcription of these using state of the art [[automatic speech recognition]] results in text with 30-40% [[word error rate]]. Further, even written modes of communication like online chat between customers and agents and even the interactions over email tend to be noisy. Analysis of contact center data is essential for customer relationship management, customer satisfaction analysis, call modeling, customer profiling, agent profiling, etc., and it requires sophisticated techniques to handle poorly written text.
* Printed Documents: Many libraries, government organizations and national defence organizations have vast repositories of [[hard copy]] documents. To retrieve and process the content from such documents, they need to be processed using [[Optical Character Recognition]]. In addition to printed text, these documents may also contain handwritten annotations. OCRed text can be highly noisy depending on the font size, quality of the print etc. It can range from 2-3% [[word error rate]]s to as high as 50-60% [[word error rate]]s. Handwritten annotations can be particularly hard to decipher, and error rates can be quite high in their presence.
* [[Text messaging|Short Messaging Service]] (SMS): Language usage over computer mediated discourses, like chats, emails and SMS texts, significantly differs from the standard form of the language. An urge towards shorter message length facilitating faster typing and the need for semantic clarity, shape the structure of this non-standard form known as the texting language.

'''Performative Architecture''' is architecture using digital technologies to challenge the way the built environment is designed.

People move – Architecture stops. People desire – space defines. The designer as spatial programmer collects movements and desires and releases them into the conception of building. (Anderson, 2011) 4

Building performance is a guiding design principle as an emerging approach to architecture.
Buildings are often viewed as objects that:
• Result from design and construction techniques
• Represent various practices and ideas. 2

The buildings characteristics are a reflection between the materials and to how they create the flexibility to the performance, instead of being a building that creates no movement visually or through. Both visually and structurally, the building is moving; the building complements the performance. 1

==Towards the performative in architecture==

Architecture in its contemporary environment is heading towards performative art, with the surroundings acting as the stage on which the building is able to perform and be on show. 1

The feelings, qualities, space and quantities of the D-Tower reflect the human roles and relationships with money, colour, value, feelings and action all becoming entwined. 9

Performative Architecture is a “mega-narrative” that has a universal direction that depends on particular performance-related aspects of each project. That is, that the ideas and concepts to do with performative architecture and how it is classified, is known through a common understanding worldwide. 1
Conflict arises when there is an attempt to define performative architecture through a set definition, the concept of performative architecture itself still needs to be developed and further explored to come to a concrete definition. 5
Building appearances are no longer the sole emphasis as dynamics of use, temporal change, poetics of space, indeterminate patterns and processes become a clear indication of performance. 5

The role of the architect in performance is to understand the multiply effects in material and time, rather than to simply predict.

==Computing the performative==

Technology such as the advances in computer programs opens up possibilities to the emergence of performative-based design, as the Building performance is the guiding principle of form making. 3
Building performance is affected by spatial, social, cultural and financial factors. Advances in digital technology programs, enables new performative structures that otherwise would have been incomprehensible, and it opens up new possibilities being able to see the structure in 3D on the computers before construction. Emphasis is shifting to the processes of form generation, based on performative strategies of design such as structure, acoustics or environment design. 3

Technology has opened up new possibilities for designers to assess certain performance aspects of their designs as it becomes realistic.
Architects and engineers are working in collaboration to create these seemingly impossible performative structures. 7

==Movement and Performance==

Architecture can be given performative capacity through the movement of people around and through a building.
The experience of structures spatial presence and materiality along with the engagement of the eye and the body which makes architecture performative. 1

The creating of architecture of spectacle and performance comes through the movement of the object/building itself rather than from the subject. 1
The Millennium Bridge in Gateshead, UK, is the world's first rotating bridge, the entire bridge rotates around pivots on both sides of the river so that its tilt creates sufficient clearance for the ships to pass underneath. 8

The mechanics of the building create action, with some parts of the building literally being able to move, such as screens, apertures, and furnishings, although this movement may be mechanical or manual, initiated by human or environmental prompts. 1
An illustration of this aspect of architectural performance is Renzo Piano’s Aurora Place in Sydney, Australia (1996–2000), its exterior surfaces and elements consist of moving and moveable mechanisms. 10

Performative architecture is still under developing ideas as a concrete definition. As the term is widely used but rarely are structures linked back to being performance architecture.

Much of these derive from the influence of [[List of martial arts|various international]] [[martial arts]]. An additional aspect of combat with [[improvised weapon]]ry is sometimes included to varying degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/902658-wwe-the-50-best-props-in-wrestling-history|title=WWE: The 50 Best Props in Wrestling History|last=Massey|first=Daniel|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/895919-the-top-10-best-illegal-weapons-in-pro-wrestling-history#slide0|title=The Top 10 Best Illegal Weapons in Pro Wrestling History|last=Clark|first=Tom|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
These facts were once kept [[Trade secret|highly secret]], but are now a widely accepted [[open secret]]. By and large, the true nature of the performance is not discussed by the performing company in official media - in order to sustain and promote the willing [[suspension of disbelief]] for the audience by maintaining an aura of [[verisimilitude (fiction)|verisimilitude]]. Fan communications by individual wrestlers and promotions through outside media (i.e. interviews) will often directly acknowledge the dramatic and "fixed" nature of the spectacle.

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
{{main|History of professional wrestling}}
Originating as a popular form of entertainment in 19th-century Europe&lt;ref name="FILA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=100246&amp;lang=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011195312/http://fila-official.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=100246&amp;lang=en|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 October 2011|title=Roots and history of Olympic wrestling|last=Anon|work=International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles|publisher=FILA|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later as a [[sideshow]] exhibition in [[North America]]n [[traveling carnival]]s and [[vaudeville]] [[music hall|halls]], professional wrestling grew into a standalone genre of entertainment with many diverse variations in cultures around the globe, and is now a billion dollar entertainment industry. Since the 1980s, local forms have greatly declined in Europe,&lt;!---OLD SCHOOL EUROPEAN PRO WRESTLING STILL EXISTS IN THE uK AND TO A LESSER EXTENT FRANCE AND GERMANY ---&gt; wrestling from North America has experienced several different periods of prominent cultural popularity during its century and a half of existence and has been exported back to Europe to fill the cultural gap left by the aforementioned decline of local versions. The advent of television gave professional wrestling a new outlet, and wrestling (along with [[boxing]]) was instrumental in making [[pay-per-view]] a viable method of [[Digital distribution|content delivery]].

== Scope and influence ==

[[File:Christopher Daniels 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A wrestler ([[Christopher Daniels]]) leaps off the top rope]]
Show wrestling has become especially prominent in [[Central America|Central]]/North America, Japan and Europe ([[Professional wrestling in the United Kingdom|especially the United Kingdom]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.net/2007/10/22/encuesta-de-mitofsky-revela-que-la-lucha-no-es-el-segundo-deporte-mas-popular-en-mexico/|title=Encuesta De Mitofsky Revela Que La Lucha No Es El Segundo Deporte Mas Popular En Mexico|author=Yoav|date=October 22, 2007|accessdate=September 5, 2009|work=SuperLuchas|language=Spanish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804090134/http://superluchas.net/2007/10/22/encuesta-de-mitofsky-revela-que-la-lucha-no-es-el-segundo-deporte-mas-popular-en-mexico/|archivedate=August 4, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Brazil]], there was a very popular wrestling television program from the 1960s to the early 1980s called ''[[Telecatch]]''. High-profile figures in the sport have become celebrities or [[cultural icon]]s in their native or adopted home countries.

Although professional wrestling started out as small acts in [[sideshow]]s, traveling [[circus]]es and [[traveling carnival|carnivals]], today it is a billion-dollar industry. Revenue is drawn from ticket sales, network television broadcasts, [[pay-per-view]] broadcasts, branded merchandise and home video. Pro wrestling was instrumental in making pay-per-view a viable method of content delivery.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Annual shows such as [[WrestleMania]], [[TNA Bound for Glory|Bound for Glory]] and formerly [[Starrcade]] are among the highest-selling pay-per-view programming each year. In modern day, internet programming has been utilized by a number of companies to air web shows, internet pay per views (IPPVs) or on-demand content, helping to generate internet-related revenue earnings from the evolving [[World Wide Web]].

Home video sales dominate the [[Billboard charts]] Recreational Sports DVD sales, with wrestling holding anywhere from 3 to 9 of the top 10 spots every week.&lt;ref&gt;Billboard Recreational Sports Weekly Top 10 -- [http://www.letstalkwrestling.com/search/label/Billboard%20Recrational%20Sports%20DVD%20charts Billboard Sports Weekly DVD Sales] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107004140/http://www.letstalkwrestling.com/search/label/Billboard%20Recrational%20Sports%20DVD%20charts |date=2015-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its persistent cultural presence and to its novelty within the performing arts, wrestling constitutes [[#Study and analysis of professional wrestling|a recurring topic in both academia and the media]]. Several documentaries have been produced looking at professional wrestling, most notably, ''[[Beyond the Mat]]'' directed by Barry W. Blaustein, and ''[[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows|Wrestling with Shadows]]'' featuring wrestler [[Bret Hart]] and directed by Paul Jay. There have also been many fictional depictions of wrestling; the 2008 film ''[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]]'' received several [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominations and began a career revival for star [[Mickey Rourke]].

Currently, the largest professional wrestling company worldwide is the United States-based [[WWE]], which bought out many smaller regional companies in the late 20th century, as well as its primary US competitors [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) in early 2001. Other prominent professional wrestling companies worldwide include the US-based [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|Impact Wrestling]], formerly known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), and [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH); [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] and [[Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide]] in Mexico; and the Japanese [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]], [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] and [[Pro Wrestling Noah]] leagues.

{{main|Kayfabe|Shoot (professional wrestling)}}
When talking about professional wrestling, there are two levels: the "in-show" happenings that are presented through the shows, and happenings which are outside the scope of performance (in other words, are [[real life]]) but have implications on the performance, such as performer contracts, legitimate injuries, etc. Because actual events are often co-opted by writers for incorporation into storylines for the performers, the lines are often blurred and become confused.

Special care must be taken when talking about people who perform under their own name. The actions of the character should be considered fictional events, wholly separate from the life of the performer. This is similar to other entertainers who perform with a persona that shares their own name (such as [[Kurt Angle]] and [[Kurt Angle (character)|his fictional persona]]).

Some wrestlers would incorporate elements of their real-life personalities into their characters, even if they and their in-ring persona have different names.

=== Kayfabe ===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
Historians are unsure at what point wrestling changed from competitive catch wrestling into worked entertainment. Those who participated felt that maintenance of a constant and complete illusion for all who were not involved was necessary to keep audience interest. For decades, wrestlers lived their public lives as though they were their characters.

The practice of keeping the illusion, and the various methods used to do so, came to be known as "[[kayfabe]]" within wrestling circles, or "[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work (noun)|working]] the [[Confidence trick|marks]]". An entire lexicon of slang jargon and euphemism developed to allow performers to communicate without outsiders' knowledge of what was being said.

Occasionally a performer will deviate from the intended sequence of events. This is known as a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]]. Sometimes shoot-like elements are included in wrestling stories to blur the line between performance and reality. These are known as "worked shoots". However, the vast majority of events in professional wrestling are preplanned and improvised within accepted boundaries.

Gradually, the predetermined nature of professional wrestling became an open secret, as prominent figures in the wrestling business (including World Wrestling Entertainment owner Vince McMahon) began to publicly admit that wrestling was entertainment, not competition. This public reveal has garnered mixed reactions from the wrestling community, as some feel that exposure ruins the experience to the spectators as does [[Exposure (magic)|exposure]] in [[Magic (illusion)|illusionism]]. Despite the public admission of the theatrical nature of professional wrestling, many U.S. states still [[Regulation of sport|regulate]] professional wrestling as they do other professional competitive sports. For example, New York State still regulates "professional wrestling" through the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] (SAC).

=== Aspects of performing art ===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
Professional wrestling shows can be considered a form of [[theater in the round]], with the ring, ringside area, and entryway comprising a [[stage (theatre)|stage]]. However, there is a much more limited concept of a [[fourth wall]] than in most theatric performances. The audience is recognized and acknowledged by the performers as [[spectator sport|spectators]] to the sporting event being portrayed, and are encouraged to interact as such. This leads to a high level of audience participation; in fact, their reactions can dictate how the performance unfolds.&lt;ref name="Barthes" /&gt; Often, individual matches will be part of a longer story line conflict between "[[Face (professional wrestling)|babyfaces]]" (often shortened to just "faces") and "[[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]]". "Faces" (the "good guys") are those whose actions are intended to encourage the audience to cheer, while "heels" (the "bad guys") act to draw the spectators' ire.&lt;ref name="HSW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling.htm |title=How Pro Wrestling Works |last=Grabianowski |first=Ed |work=HowStuffWorks, Inc. |publisher=[[Discovery Communications]] |accessdate=2014-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LDla2zy5?url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling.htm |archivedate=2013-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rules ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
There is no governing authority for professional wrestling rules, although there is a general standard which has developed. Each [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] has their own variation, but all are similar enough to avoid confusion most of the time. Any rule described here is simply a standard, and may or may not correspond exactly with any given promotion's ruleset.

Due to the staged nature of wrestling, these are not actual "rules"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling2.htm|title=How Pro Wrestling Works|date=2006-01-13|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense that they would be considered in similar articles about actual sports like [[freestyle wrestling]]. Instead, the "rules" in this article are implemented and supposedly enforced for the sake of [[suspension of disbelief]] (known as [[kayfabe]] in the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms|jargon of the business]]).

=== General structure ===
Matches are held between two or more sides ("corners"). Each corner may consist of one wrestler, or a team of two or more. Most team matches are governed by tag team rules (see below). Other matches are free-for-alls, with multiple combatants but no teams. In all variants, there can be only one winning team or wrestler.

The standard method of scoring is the "fall", which is accomplished by:
* [[Pin (professional wrestling)|Pinning]] the opponent's shoulders to the mat, typically for three seconds (though other times have been used)
* Forcing the opponent to [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submit]]
* [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|Disqualification]] of the opponent
* The opponent remaining outside the ring for too long ([[#Countout|countout]])
* [[Knockout|Knocking out]] or otherwise incapacitating the opponent
These are each explained in greater detail below. Typically, pinfalls and submissions must occur within the ring area, however there are times where it may be stipulated otherwise.

Most wrestling matches last for a set number of falls, with the first side to achieve the majority number of pinfalls, submissions, or countouts being the winner. Historically, matches were wrestled to 3 falls ("best 2 out of 3") or 5 falls ("best 3 out of 5"). The standard for modern matches is one fall. However, even though it is now standard, many announcers will explicitly state this (e.g. "The following contest is set for one fall with a 20-minute time limit.") These matches are given a time limit; if not enough falls are scored by the end of the time limit, the match is declared a draw. Modern matches are generally given a 10- to 30-minute time limit for standard matches; title matches can go for up to one hour. British wrestling matches held under [[Admiral-Lord Mountevans rules]] are 2 out of 3 falls.

An alternative is a match set for a prescribed length of time, with a running tally of falls. The entrant with the most falls at the end of the time limit is declared the winner. This is usually for 20, 30 or 60 minutes, and is commonly called an [[Iron Man match]]. This type of match can be modified so that fewer types of falls are allowed.

In matches with multiple competitors, an elimination system may be used. Any wrestler who has a fall scored against them is forced out of the match, and the match continues until only one remains. However, it is much more common when more than two wrestlers are involved to simply go one fall, with the one scoring the fall, regardless of who they scored it against, being the winner. In championship matches, this means that, unlike one-on-one matches (where the champion can simply disqualify himself or get himself counted out to retain the title via the '''Champion&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Advantage'''), the champion does ''not'' have to be pinned or involved in the decision to lose the championship. However, [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] champions often find advantages, not in Champion's Advantage, but in the use of weapons and outside interference, as these poly-sided matches tend to involve [[hardcore wrestling|no holds barred]] rules.

[[File:Professional wrestling ladder match.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A WWE [[Money in the Bank ladder match]], 2009]]
Many modern specialty matches have been devised, with unique winning conditions. The most common of these is the [[ladder match]]. In the basic ladder match, the wrestlers or teams of wrestlers must climb a ladder to obtain a prize that is hoisted above the ring. The key to winning this match is that the wrestler or team of wrestlers must try to incapacitate each other long enough for one wrestler to climb the ladder and secure that prize for their team. As a result, the ladder can be used as a weapon. The prizes include but are not limited to any given championship belt (the traditional prize), a document granting the winner the right to a future title shot, or any document that matters to the wrestlers involved in the match (such as one granting the winner a cash prize).  Another common specialty match is known as the [[battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]]. In a battle royal, all the wrestlers enter the ring to the point that there are 20-30 wrestlers in the ring at one time. When the match begins, the simple objective is to throw the opponent over the top rope and out of the ring with both feet on the floor to eliminate that opponent. The last wrestler standing is declared the winner. A variant on this type of match is the WWE's [[Royal Rumble]] where two wrestlers enter the ring to start the match and other wrestlers follow in 90 second intervals (previously 2 minutes) until 30-40 wrestlers have entered the ring. All other rules stay the same. For more match types, see [[Professional wrestling match types]].

Every match must be assigned a rule keeper known as a [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]], who is the final arbitrator. In multi-man [[lucha libre]] matches, two referees are used, one inside the ring and one outside.

Due to the [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|legitimate]] role that referees play in wrestling of serving as liaison between the bookers backstage and the wrestlers in the ring (the role of being a final arbitrator is merely [[kayfabe]]), the referee is present, even in matches that do not at first glance appear to require a referee (such as a ladder match, as it is no holds barred, and the criteria for victory could theoretically be assessed from afar). Although their actions are also frequently scripted for dramatic effect, referees are subject to certain general rules and requirements to maintain the theatrical appearance of unbiased authority. The most basic rule is that an action must be seen by a referee to be declared for a fall or disqualification. This allows for [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] characters to gain a scripted advantage by distracting or disabling the referee to perform some ostensibly illegal maneuver on their opponent. Most referees are unnamed and essentially anonymous, though some wrestling promotions have let their officials reveal their names.

Special [[Referee (professional wrestling)#Special referees|guest referee]]s may be used from time to time; by virtue of their celebrity status, they are often scripted to dispense with the appearance of neutrality and use their influence to unfairly influence the outcome of the match for added dramatic impact. Face special referees will often fight back against hostile heel wrestlers, particularly if the special referee is either a wrestler himself or a famous martial artist (such as [[Tito Ortiz]] at the main event at [[Hard Justice (2005)|TNA Hard Justice 2005]]).

For heel special referees, common ways of assisting the heel wrestler to obtain victory include, but are not limited to, the following:
* Counting fast whenever the face wrestler is being pinned, while counting slow, faking a wrist or eye injury, or even refusing to count at all, when the heel wrestler is being pinned.
* Allowing heel wrestlers to use blatantly illegal tactics that most normal referees would instantly disqualify for, while not extending these relaxed rules to face wrestlers.
* Disqualifying the face wrestler for unfair reasons, such as an accidental attack on the referee or a maneuver that appears to be an illegal attack.
* Feigning unconsciousness far longer than they would normally otherwise be out, or using convenient distractions to look away from the wrestlers for a prolonged period of time. This allows for greater opportunities for run-ins or use of illegal weapons and tactics, or can be used as an excuse to avoid counting a pinfall or calling a submission in the face's favor. The referee often instantly up the moment the heel wrestler seems to have an advantage, usually the moment the heel goes for the pinfall or applies a submission finisher.
* Actually assisting in attacking the face wrestler.

Matches are held within a [[wrestling ring]], an elevated square [[canvas]] mat with posts on each corner. A cloth apron hangs over the edges of the ring. Three horizontal ropes or cables surround the ring, suspended with turnbuckles which are connected to the posts. For safety, the ropes are padded at the turnbuckles and cushioned mats surround the floor outside the ring. Guardrails or a similar barrier enclose this area from the audience. Wrestlers are generally expected to stay within the confines of the ring, though matches sometimes end up outside the ring, and even in the audience, to add excitement.

=== Tag rules ===

In some team matches, only one entrant from each team may be designated as the "legal" or "active" wrestler at any given moment. Two wrestlers must make physical contact (typically palm-to-palm) to transfer this legal status. This is known as a "tag", with the participants "tagging out" and "tagging in". Typically the wrestler who is tagging out has a 5-second count to leave the ring, whereas the one tagging in can enter the ring at any time, resulting in heels legally double-teaming a face.

The non-legal wrestlers must remain outside the ring or other legal area at all times (and avoid purposeful contact with the opposing wrestlers) or face reprimand from the referee. In most promotions, the wrestler to be tagged in must be touching the turnbuckle on his corner, or a cloth strap attached to the turnbuckle.

Some multi-wrestler matches allow for a set number of legal wrestlers, and a legal wrestler may tag out to any other wrestler, regardless of team. In these matches, the tag need not be a mutual effort, and this results in active wrestlers being tagged out against their will, or non-legal wrestlers forced to enter the battle.

Sometimes, poly-sided matches that pit every man for himself will incorporate tagging rules. Outside of kayfabe, this is done to give wrestlers a break from the action (as these matches tend to go on for long periods of time), and to make the action in the ring easier to choreograph. One of the most mainstream examples of this is the Four-Corner match, the most common type of match in the [[WWE]] before it was replaced with its equivalent Fatal Four-Way; four wrestlers, each for himself, fight in a match, but only two wrestlers can be in the match at any given time. The other two are positioned in the corner, and tags can be made between any two wrestlers.

In a Texas Tornado Tag Team match, all the competitors are legal in the match, and tagging in and out is not necessary. All matches fought under [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore rules]] (such as no disqualification, no holds barred, [[ladder match]], etc.) are all contested under ''[[de facto]]'' Texas Tornado rules, since the lack of ability of a referee to issue a disqualification renders any tagging requirements moot.

Regardless of rules of tagging, a wrestler cannot pin his or her own tag team partner, even if it is technically possible from the rules of the match (e.g. Texas Tornado rules, or a three-way tag team match). This is called the "Outlaw Rule" because the first team to attempt to use that (in an attempt to unfairly retain their tag team titles) was the [[New Age Outlaws]].

=== Decisions ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}

==== Pinfall ====
{{main|Pin (professional wrestling)}}
[[File:Big John defeats Sensuelle Rosé.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An example of pinfall]]
To score by pinfall, a wrestler must pin both his opponent's shoulders against the mat while the referee slaps the mat three times (referred to as a "three count"). This is the most common form of defeat. The pinned wrestler must also be on his back and, if s/he is lying on his stomach, it usually does not count. A count may be started at any time that a wrestler's shoulders are down (both shoulders touching the mat), back-first and any part of the opponent's body is lying over the wrestler. This often results in pins that can easily be kicked out of, if the defensive wrestler is even slightly conscious. For example, an attacking wrestler who is half-conscious may simply drape an arm over an opponent, or a cocky wrestler may place his foot gently on the opponent's body, prompting a three-count from the referee.

Illegal pinning methods include using the ropes for leverage and hooking the opponent's clothing, which are therefore popular cheating methods for [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]], unless certain stipulations make such an advantage legal. Such pins as these are rarely seen by the referee and are subsequently often used by heels and on occasion by cheating faces to win matches. Even if it is noticed, it is rare for such an attempt to result in a disqualification (see below) and instead it simply results in nullification of the pin attempt, so the heel wrestler rarely has anything to lose for trying it anyway.

Occasionally, there are instances where a pinfall is made where both wrestlers' shoulders were on the mat for the three-count. This situation will most likely lead to a draw, and in some cases a continuation of the match or a future match to determine the winner.

==== Submission ====
To score by submission, the wrestler must make his opponent give up, usually, but not necessarily, by putting him in a submission hold (e.g. figure four leg-lock, arm-lock, sleeper-hold).

[[File:John Cena performs STF against Mark Henry.jpg|thumb|250px|[[John Cena]] performs his [[Professional wrestling holds#STF|STF]] submission hold against [[Mark Henry]]]]
A wrestler may voluntarily submit by verbally informing the referee (usually used in moves such as the Mexican Surfboard, where all four limbs are incapacitated, making tapping impossible). Also, since [[Ken Shamrock]] popularized it in 1997, a wrestler can indicate a voluntary submission by "[[Submission (combat sports)|tapping out]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grabianowski| first=Ed|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling2.htm|title=Rules of professional wrestling|publisher=Entertainment.howstuffworks.com|date=2006-01-13| accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, tapping a free hand against the mat or against an opponent. Occasionally, a wrestler will reach for a rope (see rope breaks below), only to put his hand back on the mat so he can crawl towards the rope some more; this is NOT a submission, and the referee decides what his intent is. Submission was initially a large factor in professional wrestling, but following the decline of the submission-oriented [[Catch wrestling|catch-as-catch-can]] style from mainstream professional wrestling, the submission largely faded. Despite this, some wrestlers, such as [[Chris Jericho]], [[Ric Flair]], [[Bret Hart]], [[Kurt Angle]], [[Ken Shamrock]], [[Dean Malenko]], [[Chris Benoit]], and [[Tazz]], became famous for winning matches via submission. A wrestler with a signature submission technique is portrayed as better at applying the hold, making it more painful or more difficult to get out of than others who use it, or can be falsely credited as inventing the hold (such as when Tazz popularized the [[kata ha jime]] judo choke in pro wrestling as the "Tazzmission").

Since all contact between the wrestlers must cease if any part of the body is touching, or underneath, the ropes, many wrestlers will attempt to break submission holds by deliberately grabbing the bottom ropes. This is called a "rope break", and it is one of the most common ways to break a submission hold. Most holds leave an arm or leg free, so that the person can tap out if he wants. Instead, he uses these free limbs to either grab one of the ring ropes (the bottom one is the most common, as it is nearest the wrestlers, though other ropes sometimes are used for standing holds such as [[Chris Masters]]' Master Lock) or drape his foot across, or underneath one. Once this has been accomplished, and the accomplishment is witnessed by the referee, the referee will demand that the offending wrestler break the hold, and start counting to five if the wrestler does not. If the referee reaches the count of five, and the wrestler still does not break the hold, he is disqualified.

If a [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] decides that his client wrestler should tap out, but cannot convince the wrestler himself to do so, he may "throw in the towel" (by literally taking a gym towel and hurling it into the ring where the referee can see it). This is the same as a submission, as in [[kayfabe]] the manager is considered the wrestlers [[Law of agency|agent]] and therefore authorized to make formal decisions (such as forfeiting a match) on the client's behalf.

==== Knockout ====
Passing out in a submission hold constitutes a loss by [[knockout]]. To determine if a wrestler has passed out in WWE, the referee usually picks up and drops his hand. If it drops to the mat or floor three consecutive times without the wrestler having the strength to hold it up, the wrestler is considered to have passed out. At one point this was largely ignored. However, the rule is now much more commonly observed for safety reasons. If the wrestler has passed out, the opponent then scores by submission.

A wrestler can also win by knockout if he does not resort to submission holds, but stills pummels his opponent to the point that he is completely out cold. To check for a knockout in this manner a referee would wave his hand in front of the wrestlers' face and, if the wrestler does not react in any way, the referee would award the victory to the other wrestler.

==== Countout ====
A countout (alternatively "count-out" or "count out") happens when a wrestler is out of the ring long enough for the referee to count to ten (twenty in some promotions) and thus disqualified. The count is broken and restarted when a wrestler in the ring exits the ring. Playing into this, some wrestlers would "milk" the count by sliding in the ring and immediately sliding back out. As he was technically inside the ring for a split second before exiting again, it is sufficient to restart the count. This is often referred to by commentators as "breaking the count". Heels often use this tactic in order to buy themselves more time to catch their breath, or to attempt to frustrate their [[face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] opponents.

If all the active wrestlers in a match are down inside the ring at the same time, the referee would begin a count (usually ten seconds, twenty in Japan). If nobody rises to their feet by the end of the count, the match is ruled a draw. Any participant who stands up in time would end the count for everyone else, while in a Last Man Standing match this form of a countout is the only way that the match can end, so the referee would count when one or more wrestlers are down and one wrestler standing up before the 10-count does not stop the count for another wrestler who is still down.

In some promotions (and most major modern ones), Championships cannot change hands via a countout, unless the on-screen authority declares it for at least one match, although in others, championships may change hands via countout. Heels are known to take advantage of this and will intentionally get counted out when facing difficult opponents, especially when defending championships.

==== Disqualification ====
Disqualification (sometimes abbreviated as "DQ") occurs when a wrestler violates the match's rules, thus losing automatically. Although a countout can technically be considered a disqualification (as it is, for all intents and purposes, an automatic loss suffered as a result of violating a match rule), the two concepts are often distinct in wrestling. A no disqualification match can still end by countout (although this is rare). Typically, a match must be declared a "no holds barred" match, a "street fight" or some other term, in order for both disqualifications and countouts to be waived.

Disqualification from a match is called for a number of reasons:
* Performing any illegal holds or maneuvers, such as refusing to break a hold when an opponent is in the ropes, hair-pulling, choking or biting an opponent, or repeatedly punching with a closed fist. These violations are usually subject to a referee-administered five count and will result in disqualification if the wrestler does not cease the offending behavior in time. Note that the ban on closed fists does not apply if the attacker is in middair when the punch connects, like with [[Jerry Lawler]]'s diving fist drop or [[Roman Reigns]]' [[Superman Punch]].
* Attacking an opponent's eye, such as raking it, poking it, [[Eye-gouging|gouging it]], punching it or other severe attacks to the eye.
* Any outside interference involving a person not involved in the match striking or holding a wrestler. Sometimes (depending on the promotion and uniqueness of the situation), if a heel attempts to interfere but is ejected from the ring by a wrestler or referee before this occurs, there may not be a disqualification. In this disqualification method, the wrestler being attacked by the foreign member is awarded the win. Sometimes, however, this can work in heels' favor. In February 2009, [[Shawn Michaels]], who was under the [[kayfabe]] employment of [[John Layfield|John "Bradshaw" Layfield]], interfered in a match and super kicked JBL in front of the referee to get his employer the win via "outside interference".
* Striking an opponent with a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Foreign object|foreign object]] (an object not permitted by the rules of the match; see [[hardcore wrestling]]) (sometimes the win decision can be reversed if the referee spots the weapon before pin attempt or after the match because they tried to strike when referee is either distracted or knocked out).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wgcsIi1RBI World Champion Bully Ray vs. Samoa Joe - Oct 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Using any kind of "banned" move (see below for details).
* A direct [[Groin attack|low blow to the groin]] (unless the rules of the match specifically allow this).
* Intentionally laying hands on the referee.
* Pulling an opponent's mask off during a match (this is illegal in Mexico, and sometimes in Japan).
* Throwing an opponent over the top rope during a match (this move is still illegal in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]], however, in cases like the [[Royal Rumble]] match, this will be allowed in order to eliminate a wrestler from the match.)
* In a mixed tag team match, a man hitting a woman(intergender), or a normal sized wrestler attacking an opposing midget wrestler(tag team matches involving teams with one normal-sized and one midget wrestler).

In practice, not all rule violations will result in a disqualification as the referee may use his own judgement and is not obligated to stop the match. Usually, the only offenses that the referee will see and ''immediately'' disqualify the match on (as opposed to having multiple offenses) are [[Groin attack|low blows]], [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Foreign object|weapon usage]], interference, or assaulting the referee. In WWE, a referee must see the violation with his own eyes to rule that the match end in a disqualification (simply watching the video tape is not usually enough) and the referee's ruling is almost always final, although ''dusty finishes'' (named after, and made famous by, [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]) will often result in the referee's decision being overturned. It is not uncommon for the referees themselves to get knocked out during a match, which is commonly referred to by the term "ref bump". While the referee remains "unconscious", wrestlers are free to violate rules until he is revived or replaced. In some cases, a referee might disqualify a person under the presumption that it was that wrestler who knocked him out; most referee knockouts are arranged to allow a wrestler, usually a heel, to gain an advantage. For example, a wrestler may get whipped into a referee at a slower speed, knocking the ref down for short amount of time; during that interim period, one wrestler may pin his opponent for a three-count and would have won the match but for the referee being down (sometimes, another referee will sprint to the ring from backstage to attempt to make the count, but by then, the other wrestler has had enough time to kick out on his own accord).

If all participants in a match continue to breach the referee's instructions, the match may end in a double disqualification, where both wrestlers or teams (in a [[tag team]] match) have been disqualified. The match is essentially nullified, and called a draw or in some cases a restart or the same match being held at a pay-per-view or next night's show.  Sometimes, however, if this happens in a match to determine the challenger for a heel champion's title, the champion is forced to face both opponents simultaneously for the title.  Usually, the double disqualification is caused by the heel wrestler's associates in a match between two face wrestlers to determine his opponent.

==== Forfeit ====
Although extremely rare, a match can end in a forfeit if the opponent either does not show up for the match, or shows up but refuses to compete. Although a championship usually cannot change hands except by pinfall or submission, a forfeit victory is enough to crown a new champion. The most famous example of this happened on the December 8, 1997 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw is War]]'', when [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] handed the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] to [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] after refusing to defend the title.

Forfeit victories are extremely rare in wrestling. When a pay-per-view match is booked and one wrestler is unable to make it for one reason or another, it is usually customary to insert a last minute replacement rather than award a wrestler a victory by forfeit. Forfeit victories are almost always reserved for when the story the promotion is telling specifically requires such an ending. In addition to the aforementioned moment between Steve Austin and The Rock, other instance of this happening was in March 2009, when Triple H decided not to show up for a handicap match against [[Cody Rhodes]] and [[Ted Dibiase Jr.]], instead opting to attack Randy Orton in his own home.

Despite being, statistically, an extremely rare occurrence, [[The Godfather (wrestler)#Intercontinental Champion (1998–2000)|Charles Wright]] is one wrestler who is famous for turning forfeit victories into his own gimmick. During the late 1990s, Wright called himself "The Godfather" and portrayed the gimmick of a pimp. He would often bring multiple women, who he referred to as "hoes," to the ring with him, and would offer the sexual services of these women to his opponents in exchange for them forfeiting their matches against him.

==== Draw ====
A professional wrestling match can end in a draw. A draw occurs if both opponents are simultaneously disqualified (as via [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]] or if the referee loses complete control of the match and both opponents attack each other with no regard to being in a match, like Brock Lesnar vs. Undertaker at 2002 Unforgiven), neither opponent is able to answer a ten-count, or both opponents simultaneously win the match. The latter can occur if, for example, one opponent's shoulders touch the mat while maintaining a submission hold against another opponent. If the opponent in the hold begins to [[Submission (combat sports)|tap out]] at the same time a referee counts to three for pinning the opponent delivering the hold, both opponents have legally achieved scoring conditions simultaneously. Traditionally, a championship may not change hands in the event of a draw (though it may become vacant), though some promotions such as [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] have endorsed rules where the champion may lose a title by disqualification. A variant of the draw is the time-limit draw, where the match does not have a winner by a specified time period (a one-hour draw, which was once common, is known in wrestling circles as a "Broadway").

Also if two wrestlers have been given a disqualification by either the referee or the chairman, this is a no contest and if there is a title on the line the champion keeps the championship.

==== No contest ====
A wrestling match may be declared a no contest if the winning conditions are unable to occur. This can be due to excessive interference, loss of referee's control over the match, one or more participants sustaining debilitating injury not caused by the opponent, or the inability of a scheduled match to even begin. A no contest is a state separate and distinct from a draw &amp;mdash; a draw indicates winning conditions were met. Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably in practice, this usage is technically incorrect.

== Dramatic elements ==
{{refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
While each wrestling match is ostensibly a competition of athletics and strategy, the goal of each match from a business standpoint is to excite and entertain the audience. Although the competition is staged, dramatic emphasis can be utilized to draw out the most intense reaction from the audience. Heightened interest results in higher attendance rates, increased ticket sales, higher ratings on television broadcasts (which result in greater ad revenue), higher [[pay-per-view]] buyrates, and sales of branded merchandise and recorded video footage. All of these contribute to the profit of the promotion company.

=== Character/gimmick ===
[[Image:El Hijo De Santo vs Blue Demon Jr.jpg|thumb|[[Blue Demon, Jr.]] wrestles [[El Hijo del Santo]]]]
In Latin America and English-speaking countries, most wrestlers (and other on-stage performers) portray [[Persona|character]] roles, sometimes with personalities wildly different from their own. These personalities are a [[gimmick]] intended to heighten interest in a wrestler without regard to athletic ability. Some can be unrealistic and [[cartoon]]-like (such as [[Doink the Clown]]), while others carry more verisimilitude (such as [[Chris Jericho]], [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], [[John Cena]], [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]], and [[CM Punk]]). In [[lucha libre]], many characters wear masks, adopting a [[secret identity]] akin to a [[superhero]], a near-sacred tradition.&lt;ref name="SS1"&gt;{{cite web| last=Lundin|first=Leigh |title=Lords of the Ring| url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2013/04/lord-of-rings.html |publisher=SleuthSayers| location=Orlando| date=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual wrestler may sometimes use his real name, or a minor variation of it, for much of his career, such as [[Bret Hart]], [[John Cena]] and [[Randy Orton]]. Others can keep one ring name for their entire career (cases in point include [[Shawn Michaels]], [[CM Punk]] and [[Ricky Steamboat]]), or may change from time to time to better suit the demands of the audience or company. Sometimes a character is owned and trademarked by the company, forcing the wrestler to find a new one when he leaves (although a simple typeset change, such as changing [[Rhyno]] to '''Rhino''', can usually get around this), and sometimes a character is owned by the wrestler. Sometimes, a wrestler may change his legal name to obtain ownership of his ring name (examples include [[Test (wrestler)|Andrew Martin]] and [[The Ultimate Warrior|Warrior]]). Many wrestlers (such as [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and [[The Undertaker]]) are strongly identified with their character, even responding to the name in public or between friends. It's actually considered proper decorum for fellow wrestlers to refer to each other by their stage names/characters rather than their birth/legal names, unless otherwise introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Storm, Lance (August 9, 2010). [http://www.stormwrestling.com/080910.html "Q&amp;A Commentary"]. ''Storm Wrestling''.&lt;/ref&gt; A professional wrestling character's popularity can grow to the point that it makes appearances in other media (see [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[El Santo]]) or even give the performer enough visibility to enter [[politics]] ([[Antonio Inoki]] and [[Jesse Ventura]], among others).

Typically, matches are staged between a [[protagonist]] (historically an audience favorite, known as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]], or "the good guy") and an [[antagonist]] (historically a villain with arrogance, a tendency to break rules, or other unlikable qualities, called a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]). In recent years, however, [[antihero]]es have also become prominent in professional wrestling. There is also a less common role of a "tweener", who is neither fully face nor fully heel yet able to play either role effectively (case in point, [[Samoa Joe]] during his first run in [[Impact Wrestling|TNA Wrestling]] from June 2005 to November 2006).

At times a character may "[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]]", altering their face/heel alignment. This may be an abrupt, surprising event, or it may slowly build up over time. It almost always is accomplished with a markable change in behavior on the part of the character. Some turns become defining points in a wrestler's career, as was the case when [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|Hulk Hogan turned heel]] after being a top face for over a decade. Others may have no noticeable effect on the character's status. If a character repeatedly switches between being a face and heel, this lessens the effect of such turns, and may result in apathy from the audience. [[Vince McMahon]] is a good example of having more heel and face turns than anyone in WWE history.

As with personae in general, a character's face or heel alignment may change with time, or remain constant over its lifetime (the most famous example of the latter is [[Ricky Steamboat]], a [[WWE Hall of Fame]]r who remained a babyface throughout his entire career). Sometimes a character's heel turn will become so popular that eventually the audience response will alter the character's heel-face cycle to the point where the heel persona will, in practice, become a face persona, and what was previously the face persona, will turn into the heel persona, such as when [[Dwayne Johnson]] first began using "The Rock" persona as a heel character, as opposed to his original "Rocky Maivia" babyface persona.  Another legendary example is [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], who was originally booked as a heel, with such mannerisms as drinking on the job, using [[profanity]], breaking company property, and even [[Brian Pillman#World Wrestling Federation (1996–1997)|breaking into people's private homes]].  However, much to WWF's surprise, the fans got such a charge out of Austin's antics that he effectively became one of the greatest antiheroes in the history of the business. He, along with the stable of [[D-Generation X]], is generally credited with ushering in [[the Attitude Era]] of WWF programming.

=== Story ===
[[File:Broken Hardys Expedition of Gold.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Matt Hardy]] and [[Jeff Hardy]] as Broken Hardys]]
While true [[Exhibition game|exhibition match]]es are not uncommon, most matches tell a story analogous to a scene in a play or film, or an episode of a serial drama: The face will sometimes win (triumph) or sometimes lose (tragedy). Longer [[story arc]]s can result from multiple matches over the course of time. Since most promotions have a championship title, competition for the championship is a common impetus for stories. Also, anything from a character's own hair to his job with the promotion can be [[Gambling|wager]]ed in a match.

Some matches are designed to further a story of only one participant. It could be intended to portray him or her as a strong unstoppable force, a lucky underdog, a sore loser, or any other characterization. Sometimes non-wrestling [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]]s are shown to enhance a character's image without the need for matches.

Other stories result from a natural rivalry between two or more characters. Outside of performance, these are referred to as [[feud (professional wrestling)|feuds]]. A feud can exist between any number of participants and can last for a few days up to multiple decades. The feud between [[Ric Flair]] and [[Ricky Steamboat]] lasted from the late 1970s into the early 1990s and allegedly spanned over two thousand matches (although most of those matches were mere [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]]es). The career-spanning history between characters [[Mike Awesome]] and [[Masato Tanaka]] is another example of a long-running feud, as is the case of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]] vs. [[Vince McMahon]], one of the most lucrative feuds in the World Wrestling Federation during 1998 and 1999.

In theory, the longer a feud is built up, the more audience interest (aka [[Heat (professional wrestling)|heat]]) will exist. The [[Card (sports)|main event]] of a wrestling show is generally the one with the most heat behind it. Commonly, a heel will hold the upper hand over a face until a final showdown, heightening dramatic tension as the face's fans desire to see him win.

Throughout the history of professional wrestling, many other elements and forms of media have been utilized in professional wrestling storytelling: pre- and post-match interviews, "backstage" skits, positions of authority and [[Work (professional wrestling)|worked]] behind-the-scenes feuds, division rankings (typically the #1-contendership spot), contracts, lotteries, news stories on websites, and in recent years [[social media]].

Also, anything that can be used as an element of drama can exist in professional wrestling stories: [[Romance (love)|romantic relationship]]s (including love triangles and marriage), racism, classism, nepotism, favoritism, corporate corruption, family bonds, personal histories, grudges, theft, cheating, assault, betrayal, bribery, seduction, stalking, confidence tricks, extortion, blackmail, substance abuse, self-doubt, self-sacrifice; even kidnapping, sexual fetishism,&lt;!--Gene Snitsky's foot fetish--&gt; necrophilia,&lt;!--Katie Vick--&gt; misogyny, rape and death have been portrayed in wrestling. Some promotions have included supernatural elements such as magic, curses, the [[undead]] and [[Satanism|Satanic]] imagery (most notably [[the Undertaker]] and his [[Ministry of Darkness]], a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]] that regularly performed evil rituals and [[human sacrifice]] in Satanic-like worship of a hidden power figure). Celebrities would also be involved in storylines.

Commentators have become important in communicating the relevance of the characters' actions to the story at hand, filling in past details and pointing out subtle actions that may otherwise go unnoticed.

==== Promos ====
{{main|Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo}}
A main part of the story-telling part of wrestling is a promo, short for promotional interview. Promos are performed, or "cut", in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms|wrestling jargon]], for a variety of reasons, including to heighten interest in a wrestler, or to hype an upcoming match.

Since the crowd is often too loud or the venue too large for promos to be heard naturally, wrestlers will use amplification when speaking in the ring. Unlike most Hollywood acting, large and highly visible handheld microphones are typically used and wrestlers often speak directly to the audience.

=== Championships ===
{{main|Championship (professional wrestling)}}
Professional wrestling mimics the structure of [[Champion|title match]] [[combat sport]]s. Participants compete for a [[Championship (professional wrestling)|championship]] and must defend it after winning it. These titles are represented physically by a [[Championship belt|title belt]] that can be worn by the champion. In the case of team wrestling, there is a title belt for each member of the team.

Almost all [[professional wrestling promotion]]s have one major title, and some have more. Championships are designated by divisions of weight, height, gender, wrestling style and other qualifications.

Typically, each promotion only recognizes the "legitimacy" of their own titles, although [[cross-promotion]] does happen. When one promotion absorbs or purchases another, the titles from the defunct promotion may continue to be defended in the new promotion or be decommissioned.

[[wikt:behind the scenes|Behind the scenes]], the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Book|bookers]] in a company will place the title on the most accomplished performer, or those the bookers believe will generate [[Fandom|fan]] interest in terms of event attendance and television viewership. Lower ranked titles may also be used on the performers who show potential, thus allowing them greater exposure to the audience. However other circumstances may also determine the use of a championship. A combination of a championship's lineage, the caliber of performers as champion, and the frequency and manner of title changes, dictates the audience's perception of the title's quality, significance and reputation.

A wrestler's championship accomplishments can be central to their career, becoming a measure of their performance ability and [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Draw|drawing]] power. In general, a wrestler with multiple title reigns or an extended title reign is indicative of a wrestler's ability to maintain audience interest or a wrestler's ability to perform in the ring. As such, the most accomplished or decorated wrestlers tend to be revered as legends despite the predetermined nature of title reigns. American wrestler [[Ric Flair]] has had multiple [[World heavyweight championship (professional wrestling)|world heavyweight championship]] reigns spanning over three decades. Japanese wrestler [[Último Dragón]] once held and defended a record 10 titles simultaneously.

=== Non-standard matches ===
Often a match will take place under additional rules, usually serving as a special attraction or a climactic point in a feud or storyline. Sometimes this will be the culmination of an entire feud, ending it for the immediate future (known as a blowoff match).

Perhaps the most well-known non-standard match is the [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|cage match]], in which the ring is surrounded by a fence or similar metal structure, with the express intention of preventing escape or outside interference—and with the added bonus of the cage being a potentially brutal weapon or platform for launching attacks. The WWE has another provision where a standard cage match can end with one wrestler or wrestling team escaping the cage through the door or over the top.

Another example is the WWE's Royal Rumble match, which involves thirty participants in a random and unknown order. The Rumble match is itself a spectacle in that it is a once-yearly event with multiple participants, including individuals who might not interact otherwise. It also serves as a catalyst for the company's ongoing feuds, as well as a springboard for new storylines.

=== Ring entrance ===
[[Image:Triple H Entrance Sequence Melbourne 10.11.2007.jpg|thumb|450px|[[Triple H]] performing his ring entrance pose, mounting the second rope and displaying his physique, under strobe lights]]
While the wrestling matches themselves are the primary focus of professional wrestling, a key dramatic element of the business can be entrances of the wrestlers to the arena and ring. It is typical for a wrestler to get their biggest crowd reaction (or "pop") for their ring entrance, rather than for anything they do in the wrestling match itself, especially if former main event stars are returning to a promotion after a long absence.

All notable wrestlers now enter the ring accompanied by music, and regularly add other elements to their entrance. The music played during the ring entrance will usually mirror the wrestler's personality. Many wrestlers, particularly in America, have music and lyrics specially written for their ring entrance. While invented long before, the practice of including music with the entrance gained rapid popularity during the 1980s, largely as a result of the huge success of [[Hulk Hogan]] and the WWF, and their [[1980s professional wrestling boom|Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]]. When a match is won, the victor's theme music is usually also played in celebration.

Because wrestling is predetermined, a wrestler's entrance music will play as they enter the arena, even if they are, in [[kayfabe]], not supposed to be there. For example, in 2012 through 2014, [[The Shield (professional wrestling)|The Shield]] was a trio of wrestlers who were (in kayfabe) not at the time under contract with WWE (hence their gimmick of entering the ring through the crowd), but they still had entrance music which was played whenever they entered the arena, despite the fact that they were kayfabe invaders.

With the introduction of the Titantron entrance screen in 1997, WWF/WWE wrestlers also had entrance videos made that would play along with their entrance music.

Other dramatic elements of a ring entrance can include:
* [[Pyrotechnics]]
* Additional visual graphics or staging props to complement the entrance video/routine or further emphasize the character. For instance, [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]'s entrance graphics employ heavy use of fire-themed visuals, [[The Undertaker]]'s entrance features dark lighting, fire, fog and dry ice, and lightning-themed effects, [[John Morrison (wrestler)|John Morrison]]'s entrance would feature use of multicolored psychedelic style patterns, [[The Miz]] has in the past incorporated inflatable lettering spelling out the word "AWESOME" into his entrance, and [[Montel Vontavious Porter]] frequently used an inflatable entrance tunnel during his [[WWE]] tenure. [[Goldust]] has been known to use on-screen visual effects in his entrance to simulate the presentation of a feature film (i.e. widescreen, production company credits), as to emphasize his Hollywood-themed film aficionado character. [[Brodus Clay]] entered with disco ball lighting effects to emphasize his "Funkasaurus" character.
* A distinct sound or opening note in the music (used to elicit a [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovian]] response from the crowd). For example, the glass shattering in [[WWF The Music, Vol. 3|Steve Austin's entrance theme]], [[The Undertaker]]'s signature [[Funeral toll|bell toll]], or the sound of bells and a cow's moo in JBL's theme.
* Darkening of the arena, often accompanied by [[Stage lighting|mood lighting]] or [[strobe light]]ing, such as in The Undertaker's, [[Triple H]]'s, or [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]]'s entrances. Certain colors of lighting have been associated with specific wrestlers; for instance, blue lighting for [[The Undertaker]], green lighting for Triple H, [[D-Generation X]], and [[Shane McMahon]], red and orange lighting for [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], multicolored lighting for [[John Morrison (wrestler)|John Morrison]], gold lighting for [[Dustin Rhodes|Goldust]], pink lighting for [[Sean Morley|Val Venis]], and so forth.
* Costumes that evoke "otherworldly" or "fictional" themes. With examples such as Big Van Vader's bio-mechanical themed headdress which spewed steam, Pyro's fire shooting outfit, Shockmaster's bejeweled space helmet, and Ricky Steamboat's dragon costume, to name a few.
* Entering in a manner in keeping with their character traits, such as a fast, highly energetic entrance, or a slow, stoic entrance. For example, The Ultimate Warrior would run at high speed down the entrance ramp and into the ring while [[Randy Orton]] would slowly and darkly walk to the ring. The Undertaker has adopted one of the most notable entrances, taking around 4 to 5 minutes, darkening the whole arena, and performing a slow, intimidating walk. Like sound effects, some entrance mannerisms often become signature to individual wrestlers. For example, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]]'s entrance often involves him standing on the second turnbuckle, raising his hands in the air for few seconds, and then doing the same thing for the other three turnbuckles, a mannerism which has become just as much a signature part of Austin's entrance as the glass-shattering sound effect.
* Driving a vehicle into the arena. For example, [[Eddie Guerrero]] would arrive into the arena in a lowrider, The Undertaker (in his "American Bad Ass" biker gimmick), [[Chuck Palumbo]], [[Lisa Marie Varon|Tara]], and the [[Disciples of Apocalypse]] on motorcycles, [[The Mexicools]] on riding lawn mowers, JBL in his limousine, [[Alberto Del Rio]] arriving into the arena in various luxury cars, Steve Austin driving an [[all-terrain vehicle]], and perhaps most recently [[Camacho (wrestler)|Camacho]] and [[Hunico]] entering on a lowrider bicycle.
* Acting out a trademark behavior, such as posing to display their [[Bodybuilding|muscularity]], mounting the ring ropes, or sitting in the corner.
* Talking to the crowd using a distinctive [[patter]]. For instance, chanting or rapping along with the music (i.e. [[Road Dogg]], [[Ron Killings|R-Truth]]). Another example is [[Vickie Guerrero]] entering to no music, but announcing her arrival with the words "Excuse me!"
* Many [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] with narcissistic gimmicks ([[Lex Luger]], [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Cody Rhodes]], [[Paul Orndorff]], etc.) would admire themselves with a mirror on their way to the ring.
* Coming through the audience, such as [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman's]] beer drinking and can smashing entrance, or [[Diamond Dallas Page]]'s exit through the crowd, or most recently, The Shield walking through the arena.
* Accompaniment by a [[Cornerman|ringside crew]] or personal security, an example of which would be [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]]
* Entering the arena by a lift in the stage, such as [[Kurt Angle]], [[David Heath (wrestler)|Gangrel]] and [[Rey Mysterio]]
* If a wrestler is a current champion, he will attempt to visually draw attention to his championship belt by either holding it high over his head or (if the belt is worn around the waist) moving his hands across it or pointing to it.
Another method of entry involves descending from the ceiling with a [[Zip-line]] or [[Abseiling|rappel line]] and stunt harness. This has been done by Shawn Michaels at [[WrestleMania XII]], by Sting many times in WCW and TNA, and has gained major controversy over its role in the death of wrestler [[Owen Hart]] at [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge]].

Special ring entrances are also developed for big occasions, most notably the [[WrestleMania]] event. For example, WrestleMania III and VI both saw all wrestlers enter the arena on motorized miniature wrestling rings. Live bands are sometimes hired to perform live entrance music at special events. [[John Cena]] and [[Triple H]] are particularly notable in recent years for their highly theatrical entrances at WrestleMania.

=== Women's wrestling ===
{{see also|Women in WWE|Impact Knockouts}}
[[File:Cholita wrestling bolivia3 Joel Alvarez.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Fighting Cholitas]] in Bolivia]]
The women's division of professional wrestling has maintained a recognized world champion since 1937, when [[Mildred Burke]] won the original World Women's title. She then formed the World Women's Wrestling Association in the early 1950s and recognized herself as the first champion, although the championship would be vacated upon her retirement in 1956. The NWA however, ceased to acknowledge Burke as ''their'' Women's World champion in 1954, and instead acknowledged [[June Byers]] as champion after a controversial finish to a high-profile match between Burke and Byers that year. Upon Byers' retirement in 1964, [[The Fabulous Moolah]], who won a junior heavyweight version of the [[NWA World Women's Championship]] (the predecessor to the [[WWE Women's Championship]]) in a tournament back in 1958, was recognized by most NWA promoters as champion by default.

=== Intergender wrestling ===
For most of its history, men and women would rarely compete against each other in professional wrestling, as it was deemed to be unfair and unchivalrous. [[Andy Kaufman]] used this to gain notoriety when he created an Intergender Championship and declared it open to any female challenger. This led to a long (worked) feud with [[Jerry Lawler]].

In the 1980s, mixed tag team matches began to take place, with a male and female on each team and a rule stating that each wrestler could only attack the opponent of the same gender. If a tag was made, the other team had to automatically switch their legal wrestler as well. Despite these restrictions, many mixed tag matches do feature some physical interaction between participants of different genders. For example, a heel may take a cheap shot at the female wrestler of the opposing team to draw a negative crowd reaction. In lucha libre, cheap-shots and male-female attacks are not uncommon.&lt;ref name="SS1" /&gt;

[[Intergender wrestling|Intergender]] singles bouts were first fought on a national level in the 1990s. This began with [[Luna Vachon]], who faced men in ECW and WWF. Later, [[Chyna]] became the first female to hold a belt that was not exclusive to women when she won the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]].  While it is a rare feat in WWE, in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|TNA]], [[ODB (wrestler)|ODB]] participates in singles intergender matches.  Also, ODB's kayfabe husband and tag team partner [[Eric Young (wrestler)|Eric Young]] held the Knockouts tag team titles for a record 478 days before it was stripped by [[Brooke Hogan]] because Young was a male.

=== Midget wrestling ===
{{further|Midget wrestling}}
Midget wrestling can be traced to professional wrestling's carnival and vaudeville origins. In recent years, the popularity and prevalence of midgets in wrestling has greatly decreased due to wrestling companies depriving midget divisions of storyline or feud. However, WWE has made a few attempts to enter this market with their "minis" in the 1990s and the "junior's league" as recent as 2006. It is still a popular form of entertainment in Mexican wrestling, mostly as a "sideshow".

Some wrestlers may have their own specific "mini me", like [[Mascarita Sagrada]], Alebrije has Quije, etc. There are also cases in which midgets can become valets for a wrestler, and even get physically involved in matches, like [[KeMonito|Alushe]], who often accompanies [[Tinieblas]], or [[KeMonito]], who is portrayed as Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre's mascot and is also a valet for Mistico. [[Dave Finlay]] was often aided in his matches by a midget known mainly as [[Hornswoggle]] while in WWE, who hid under the ring and gave a [[Shillelagh (club)|shillelagh]] to Finlay to use on his opponent. Finlay also occasionally threw him at his opponent(s). Hornswoggle has also been given a run with the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship]] and feuded with [[D-Generation X|D-X]] in 2009.

== Styles and characteristics in different countries ==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
[[File:ALL JAPAN プロレス LOVE in Taiwan.jpg|thumb|250px|A match of All Japan Pro Wrestling in Taiwan, 2009]]
The U.S., Japan and Mexico are three countries where there is a huge market and high popularity for professional wrestling. But the styles of professional wrestling are different, given their independent development for a long period.

Professional wrestling in the U.S. tends to have a heavy focus on story building and the establishment of characters (and their personalities). There is a story for each match, and even a longer story for successive matches. The stories usually contain characters like [[face (professional wrestling)|faces]] and [[heel (professional wrestling)|heels]], and less often [[antihero]]es and tweeners. It is a "triumph" if the face wins, while it is a "tragedy" if the heel wins. The characters usually have strong and sharp personalities, with examples like [[Doink the Clown]], whose personality is melodramatic, slapstick and fantastical. The opposition between faces and heels is very intense in the story, and the heels may even attack the faces during TV interviews. The relationship between different characters can also be very complex.

[[File:Lucha libre — Arena México por Carlos Adampol 001.jpg|thumb|left|Mexican wrestler [[Andrade Cien Almas|La Sombra]] taking down opponent with a wrestling move]]
Although professional wrestling in Mexico ([[Lucha libre]]) also has stories and characters, they are less emphasized. Wrestlers in Mexico are traditionally more agile and perform more [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques|aerial maneuvers]] than [[History of professional wrestling in the United States|professional wrestlers in the U.S.]] who, more often, rely on power moves and strikes to subdue their opponents.&lt;ref name="SS1" /&gt; The difference in styles is due to the independent evolution of the sport in Mexico beginning in the 1930s and the fact that wrestlers in the [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|cruiserweight]] division ({{Lang-es|italics=yes|peso semicompleto}}) are often the most popular wrestlers in Mexican lucha libre. Wrestlers often execute high flying moves characteristic of lucha libre by utilizing the [[wrestling ring]]'s ropes to catapult themselves towards their opponents, using intricate combinations in rapid-fire succession, and applying complex submission holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2006/06/17/1638198.html|title=CANOE - SLAM! Sports - Wrestling - Lucha Libre 101|publisher=Slam.canoe.ca|accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucha libre is also known for its [[tag team]] wrestling matches, in which the teams are often made up of three members, instead of two as is common in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stas|last=Bekman|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/sports/pro-wrestling/8-6-Lucha-Libre-confuses-me-what-are-the-rules.html|title=8.6. Lucha Libre confuses me, what are the rules?|publisher=Stason.org|accessdate=2012-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of Japanese professional wrestling ([[puroresu]]) is again different. With its origins in traditional American style of wrestling and still being under the same genre, it has become an entity in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmoz.org/Sports/Wrestling/Professional/Puroresu/desc.html|title=Open Directory category description|publisher=Open Directory|year=1995|accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the similarity to its American counterpart in that the outcome of the matches remains predetermined, the phenomena are different in the form of the [[sport psychology|psychology]] and presentation of the sport. In most of the largest promotions, such as [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]], [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] and [[Pro Wrestling Noah]], it is treated as a [[Contact sport#Full-contact sport|full contact]] [[combat sport]] as it mixes hard hitting [[martial arts]] strikes with [[Shoot wrestling#Shoot-style|shoot style]] [[Submission (combat sports)|submission holds]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresu.com/intro.html|title=Puroresu Dojo Introduction|publisher=Puroresu.com|year= 1995|accessdate=2009-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in the U.S. it is rather more regarded as an entertainment show. Wrestlers incorporate kicks and strikes from [[martial arts]] disciplines, and a strong emphasis is placed on [[submission wrestling]], and unlike the use of involved storylines in the U.S., they are not as intricate in Japan, more emphasis is placed on the concept of "fighting spirit", meaning the wrestlers display of physical and mental stamina are valued a lot more than theatrics. Many of Japan's wrestlers including top stars such as [[Shinya Hashimoto]], [[Riki Chōshū]] and [[Keiji Mutoh]] came from a legitimate martial arts background and many Japanese wrestlers in the 1990s began to pursue careers in mixed martial arts organizations such as Pancrase and Shooto which at the time retained the original look of puroresu but were actual competitions. Other companies, such as Michinoku Pro Wrestling and [[Dragon Gate]], wrestle in a style similar to Mexican companies like AAA and CMLL. This is known as "Lucharesu".

== Culture ==
[[File:Frank-gotch.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Frank Gotch]], 20th century professional wrestler]]
Professional wrestling has developed its own cultures, both internal and external.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Those involved in producing professional wrestling have developed a kind of global [[Secret society|fraternity]], with familial bonds, [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms|shared language]] and passed-down traditions. New performers are expected to "pay their dues" for a few years by working in lower-profile promotions and working as ring crew before working their way upward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grabianowski|first=Ed|title=Wrestling School|work=How Professional Wrestling Works| publisher=HowStuffWorks.com|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/pro-wrestling5.htm|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Derek|title=Discovery: Accidental Perfection|publisher=The Wrestling Oratory|date=2007-08-11|url=http://oratory.rajah.com/index.php?archive=3281|quote="Dragon Gate is a unique promotion as they still follow many of wrestling's biggest traditions, one being that veterans get theirs first because rookies need to "pay their dues" like they did."|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411141859/http://oratory.rajah.com/index.php?archive=3281|archivedate=2008-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The permanent rosters of most promotions develop a backstage [[pecking order]], with veterans mediating conflicts and mentoring younger wrestlers.&lt;ref name="Unions"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gadd|first=Mitchell|title=Unions|work=Reading Between the Ropes|publisher=WrestleZone.com|date=2006-07-13|url=http://www.wrestlezone.com/column.php?articleid=154797119|accessdate=2008-03-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412003958/http://www.wrestlezone.com/column.php?articleid=154797119|archivedate=2008-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many decades (and still to a lesser extent today) performers were expected to keep the illusions of wrestling's legitimacy alive even while not performing, essentially acting in character any time they were in public.&lt;ref name="Kreit"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kreit|first=Alex|title=Professional Wrestling and Its Fans: A Sociological Study of the Sport of Pro-Wrestling|work=Solie's Vintage Wrestling|publisher=Jump City Productions|year=1998|url=http://www.solie.org/articles/pwandfans.html|accessdate=2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some veterans speak of a "sickness" among wrestling performers, an inexplicable pull to remain active in the wrestling world despite the devastating effects the job can have on one's life and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Kamchen|first=Richard|title=Retro review: Piper's tale scrappy as he is|work=SLAM!

Fans of professional wrestling have their own subculture, comparable to [[fandom|those of science fiction, video games, or comic books]]. Those who are interested in the backstage occurrences, future storylines and reasonings behind company decisions read newsletters written by journalists with inside ties to the wrestling industry.&lt;ref name="Kreit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipscomb"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lipscomb|first=William|title=The Operational Aesthetic in the Performance of Professional Wrestling|publisher=Department of Communications Studies, Louisiana State University|date=May 2005|url=http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-01252005-152153/unrestricted/Lipscomb__III_dis.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324222906/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-01252005-152153/unrestricted/Lipscomb__III_dis.pdf|archivedate=2009-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "rags" or "[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dirt sheet|dirt sheet]]s" have expanded into the Internet, where their information can be dispensed on an up-to-the-minute basis. Some have expanded into [[radio]] shows.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Some fans enjoy a pastime of collecting tapes of wrestling shows from specific companies, of certain wrestlers, or of specific genres. The internet has given fans exposure to worldwide variations of wrestling they would be unable to see otherwise.&lt;ref name="Bollom"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bollom|first=Brandon W.|title=Professional Wrestling Migration: Puroresu in America|date=2004-05-07|url=http://www.burninghammer.com/academic/puroresu.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-03-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409100045/http://www.burninghammer.com/academic/puroresu.pdf|archive-date=2008-04-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, many companies have been founded which deal primarily in wrestling footage. When the WWE purchased both WCW and ECW in 2001, they also obtained the entire past video libraries of both productions and have released many past matches online and on home video.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Like some other sports, [[Fantasy sport|fantasy league]]s have developed around professional wrestling. Some take this concept further by creating [[Fantasy wrestling|E-fed]]s (electronic federations), where a user can create their own fictional wrestling character, and [[role-playing]] storylines with other users, leading to scheduled "shows" where match results are determined by the organizers, usually based on a combination of the characters' statistics and the players' roleplaying aptitude, sometimes with audience voting.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Professional wrestling in mainstream culture ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
From the first established world championship, the top professional wrestlers have garnered fame within mainstream society. Each successive generation has produced a number of wrestlers who extend their careers into the realms of music, acting, writing, business, politics or public speaking, and are known to those who are unfamiliar with wrestling in general. Conversely, celebrities from other sports or general pop culture also become involved with wrestling for brief periods of time. A prime example of this is [[1980s professional wrestling boom|The Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]] of the 1980s, which combined wrestling with [[MTV]].

[[File:US Navy 050519-N-7130B-003 Professional wrestling champion and actor Bill Goldberg takes a moment to pose with the photographers of Operations Department^rsquo,s OP Division during his tour of USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76).jpg|thumb|[[Bill Goldberg]] during his tour of [[USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76)|USS ''Ronald Reagan'']]]]
Professional wrestling is often portrayed within other works using parody, and its general elements have become familiar [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s and [[Internet meme|meme]]s in American culture.

Some terminology originating in professional wrestling has found its way into the common vernacular. Phrases such as "body slam", "sleeper hold" and "tag team" are used by those who do not follow professional wrestling. The term "smackdown", popularized by [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' in the 1990s, has been included in [[Merriam-Webster]] dictionaries since 2007.

Many television shows and films have been produced which portray in-character professional wrestlers as protagonists, such as ''[[Ready to Rumble]]'', ''[[¡Mucha Lucha!]]'', ''[[Nacho Libre]]'', and the Santo film series. At least two stage plays set in the world of pro wrestling have been produced: ''The Baron'' is a comedy that retells the life of an actual performer known as [[James Raschke|Baron von Raschke]]. ''From Parts Unknown...'' is an award-nominated Canadian drama about the rise and fall of a fictional wrestler. The 2009 ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[W.T.F. (South Park)|W.T.F.]]" played on the soap operatic elements of professional wrestling. One of the lead characters on the Disney Channel series ''[[Kim Possible]]'' was a huge fan of pro wrestling and actually featured it on an episode (with two former WWE wrestlers voicing the two fictitious wrestlers featured in the episode). The 2008 film ''[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]]'', about a washed-up professional wrestler, garnered several Oscar nominations.

The 1950 [[film noir]] [[Night and the City]], directed by [[Jules Dassin]] and starring [[Richard Widmark]] and [[Gene Tierney]], told the story of a promoter in [[London]] trying to make it big, and featured a match involving real professional wrestler [[Stanislaus Zbyszko]].

=== Study and analysis of professional wrestling ===
With its growing popularity, professional wrestling has attracted attention as a subject of serious [[Academia|academic]] study and [[Journalism|journalistic]] criticism. Many courses, theses, essays and dissertations have analyzed wrestling's [[convention (norm)|convention]]s, content, and its role in modern society. It is often included as part of studies on theatre, sociology, performance, and media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=Caceres|last=Ernesto Cruz|title=Monday Night Identity Wars: The Evolution of Performance Conventions in Professional Wrestling|year=2005|location=2005 Popular Culture Association/American Culture Association National Conference Program|url=http://www.popularculture.org/2005%20PAGES/2005%20Program.htm|accessdate=2008-03-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20050613082746/http://www.popularculture.org/2005%20PAGES/2005%20Program.htm|archivedate=2005-06-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=Brian|last=Ledford|title=Grappling with Masculinity: Representation and Reception of Televised Professional Wrestling Imagery|publisher=SIUE College of Arts and Sciences|location=2005 Spring Colloquium: Thinking About Masculinity|url=http://www.siue.edu/CAS/COLLOQUIA/MasculProgramFINAL.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409100044/http://www.siue.edu/CAS/COLLOQUIA/MasculProgramFINAL.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] developed a course of study on the cultural significance of professional wrestling,&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Institute of Technology: Comparative Media Studies course on Professional Wrestling -- [http://mitcmsprowrestling.blogspot.com/2006/12/this-class-will-explore-cultural.html Official Course weblog]&lt;/ref&gt; and anthropologist Heather Levi has written an ethnography about the culture of lucha libre in Mexico&lt;ref&gt;The World of Lucha Libre: Secrets, Revelations, and Mexican National Identity -- [[The World of Lucha Libre]]&lt;/ref&gt;

But this was not always the case; in the early 20th century, once it became apparent that the "sport" was worked, pro wrestling was looked down on as a cheap entertainment for the uneducated working class&lt;ref name="Kreit"/&gt;—an attitude that still exists to varying degrees today.&lt;ref name="Lipscomb"/&gt; The French theorist [[Roland Barthes]] was among the first to propose that wrestling was worthy of deeper analysis, in his essay "The World of Wrestling" from his book ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', first published in 1957.&lt;ref name="Barthes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barthes|first=Roland|title=The World Of Wrestling|work=Mythologies|year=1957|url= http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ikalmar/illustex/Barthes-wrestling.htm|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kreit"/&gt; Barthes argued that it should be looked at not as a scamming of the ignorant, but as [[spectacle]]; a mode of theatric performance for a willing, if bloodthirsty, audience. Wrestling is described as performed art which demands an immediate reading of the juxtaposed meanings. The logical conclusion is given least importance over the theatrical performers of the wrestlers and the referee. According to Barthes the function of a wrestler is not to win: it is to go exactly through the motions which are expected of him and to give the audience a theatrical spectacle. This work is considered a foundation of all later study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lagorio|first=Christine|title=Wrestling With The Margins|work= Education Supplement 2005|publisher=The Village Voice|date=2005-01-04|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/arts/0502,lagorio,59937,12.html|accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Documentary film|Documentary]] [[Film director|filmmakers]] have studied the lives of wrestlers and the effects the profession has on them and their families. The 1999 theatrical documentary ''[[Beyond the Mat]]'' focused on [[Terry Funk]], a wrestler nearing [[retirement]]; [[Mick Foley]], a wrestler within his prime; [[Jake Roberts]], a former star fallen from grace; and [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#School|a school of wrestling student]] trying to break into the business. The 2005 release ''[[Lipstick and Dynamite, Piss and Vinegar: The First Ladies of Wrestling]]'' chronicled the development of women's wrestling throughout the 20th century. Pro wrestling has been featured several times on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel]]''. MTV's documentary series ''[[True Life]]'' featured two episodes titled "I'm a Professional Wrestler" and "I Want to Be a Professional Wrestler". Other documentaries have been produced by [[TLC (TV channel)|The Learning Channel]] (''The Secret World of Professional Wrestling'') and [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]] (''[[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows]]''). [[Bloodstained Memoirs]] explored the careers of several pro wrestlers, including [[Chris Jericho]], [[Rob Van Dam]] and [[Roddy Piper]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Although professional wrestling is choreographed, there is a high chance of injury, and even death.&lt;ref name="OTE Facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoffco-inc.com/wwe/ppv/ppv/ote99.html|accessdate=2008-01-05|title=Under the Edge 1999 results|publisher=Hoffco}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strikes are often [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stiff|stiff]] especially in Japan and in independent wrestling promotions such as [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] and [[Ring of Honor]]. The ring is often made out of 2 by 8 timber planks.

==History==
The RCA was founded in [[Somerset House]] in 1837 as the '''Government School of Design'''{{r|aim25}} or '''Metropolitan School of Design'''.{{r|riba}}  [[Richard Burchett]] became head of the school in 1852.{{r|dnb}} In 1853 it was expanded and moved to [[Marlborough House]], and then, in 1853{{r|aim25}} or 1857,{{r|riba|dnb}} to [[South Kensington]], on the same site as the [[South Kensington Museum]]. It was renamed the '''Normal Training School of Art''' in 1857{{r|riba}} and the '''National Art Training School''' in 1863.{{r|dnb}} During the later 19th century it was primarily a [[teacher training college]]; pupils during this period included [[George Clausen]], [[Christopher Dresser]], [[Luke Fildes]], [[Kate Greenaway]] and [[Gertrude Jekyll]].{{r|dnb}}

In 1896{{r|aim25}} or 1897{{r|riba}} the school received the name '''Royal College of Art''', and the emphasis of teaching there shifted to the practice of art and design.&lt;ref name=aim25/&gt; Teaching of [[graphic design]], [[industrial design]] and [[product design]] began in the mid-twentieth century. The school expanded further in the 1960s, and in 1967 it received a  [[Royal Charter]] which gave it the status of an independent university with the power to grant its own degrees.&lt;ref name=aim25/&gt;

==Campuses==
[[File:Darwin Building, Royal College of Art in London, spring 2013.JPG|thumb|right|The Darwin Building in [[Kensington Gore]]]]

The RCA has two campuses, in [[South Kensington]] and in [[Battersea]].{{r|rca}} The Darwin Building in [[Kensington Gore]] dates from the 1960s and is a Grade II [[listed building]]. It was designed by a team of RCA staff members, [[H. T. Cadbury-Brown]], [[Hugh Casson]] and Robert Goodden.&lt;ref name=dunnett/&gt;

In 1991 the [[sculpture]] department moved to a converted factory across the river [[Thames]] in Battersea. In the early 2000s the college conceived a substantial second campus being created on the site, with a minibus service linking it to Kensington. Thus, after a successful redevelopment of the premises by [[Wright &amp; Wright]] (budget £4.3m, floor area 2,500 sq m), the present Sculpture Building opened in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal College of Art Sculpture Building officially reopens|url=http://www.rca.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/rca-sculpture-building-officially-reopens/|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bizley|first1=Graham|title=Wright &amp; Wright's RCA sculpture department refurb|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/wright-and-wright%E2%80%99s-rca-sculpture-department-refurb/3131922.article|publisher=BD online 23 January 2009|accessdate=6 October 2015}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A masterplan was commissioned by [[Haworth Tompkins]]  and phase 1 of their three phase design was completed with the opening of the Sackler Building on 19 November 2009, to house the painting department. Its name commemorates a major gift by [[Mortimer Sackler|The Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The new RCA Painting Building is now open|url=http://www.rca.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/the-new-rca-painting-building-is-now-open/|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sackler Building by Haworth Tompkins|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2009/12/02/the-sackler-building-by-haworth-tompkins/|publisher=Dezeen 2 December 2009|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RCA Sackler Building|url=https://vimeo.com/7822996|publisher=AJ Building Study video|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dyson Building, named in honour of [[James Dyson]], whose educational charity donated £5m to the development, was opened on 24 September 2012. It is the home for [[printmaking]] and [[photography]], and contains an innovation wing where start-up designers can launch their businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dyson Building by Haworth Tompkins|url=http://www.dezeen.com/2012/09/28/the-dyson-building-by-haworth-tompkins/|publisher=Dezeen 28 September 2012|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Will|title=Royal College of Art by Haworth Tompkins|url=http://www.architectural-review.com/buildings/london-schools-part-one-royal-college-of-art-by-haworth-tompkins/8643316.article|publisher=AR online 27 February 2013|accessdate=6 October 2015}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Woo Building was opened on 30 September 2015, completing the Battersea project. It is named in honour of [[Woo Po-shing|Sir Po-Shing and Lady Helen Woo]], who have funded scholarships at the RCA since the 1990s. It accommodates the Ceramics &amp; Glass and Jewellery &amp; Metal programmes. The building's [[Anodizing|anodised aluminium]] gates were designed by alumnus Max Lamb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jordan|first1=Sarah|title=RCA opens state of the art Woo Building for jewellery and silversmithing students|url=http://www.retail-jeweller.com/business/rca-opens-state-of-the-art-woo-building-for-jewellery-students/5079631.article|publisher=Retail Jeweller 2 October 2015|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Gates installed for the opening of the Woo Building Battersea|url=http://www.rca.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/new-gates-installed-opening-woo-building-battersea/|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courses==
The RCA offers Graduate Diploma, [[Master of Arts|MA]], [[Master of Philosophy|MRes, MPhil]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degrees in twenty-eight subject areas, divided into four schools: [[architecture]], arts &amp; humanities, [[communication]], and [[design]]. The [[history of design]] programme is in collaboration with the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]; there are two double MA/[[Master of Science|MSc]] programmes in [[design engineering]] with [[Imperial College London]], one of which also includes periods of study at [[Keio University]] in Tokyo and at the [[Pratt Institute]] in New York.{{r|rca2}}

==Rankings==
In the [[Research Assessment Exercise]] of December 2008, 40% of the research output of the school received the highest (4* or "world-leading") assessment, the third-highest rating in the art and design subject area; over all subject areas only about fifty institutions received a higher rating.{{r|rae}}

In April 2011 the RCA was ranked first on a list of UK graduate art schools compiled by ''[[Modern Painters (magazine)|Modern Painters]]'' magazine from a survey of professionals in the art world.{{r|city}}

In August 2015 it was ranked first on a list of master's courses in fashion by Business of Fashion, a fashion website.{{r|guard2|bof}}

In 2015 the RCA placed first in the art and design subject area in the [[QS World University Rankings]] published by [[Quacquarelli Symonds]]. In 2016 and 2017 it held onto the position, increasing its overall score from 96.0/100 to 98.4/100.{{r|guard|qs}}

==History==

SciCast was an outgrowth of an earlier project called DAGGRE (Decomposition-Based Elicitation and Aggregation), also an IARPA project that implemented GMU economist [[Robin Hanson]]'s idea of combinatorial prediction tech markets, and was a participant in the IARPA [[Aggregative Contingent Estimation]] tournament.&lt;ref name=hanson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/01/announcingscicast.html|title = Announcing: ''SciCast''|date = January 3, 2014|accessdate = May 6, 2014|last = Hanson|first = Robin|authorlink = Robin Hanson|publisher = Overcoming Bias}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/08/join-gmus-daggre-team.html|title = Join The DAGGRE Team|last = Hanson|first = Robin|authorlink = Robin Hanson|publisher = Overcoming Bias|date = August 31, 2011|accessdate = May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The launch of SciCast itself was announced by [[Robin Hanson]] on January 3, 2014,&lt;ref name=hanson/&gt; and the official announcements were made on January 10, 2014.&lt;ref name=newsdesk/&gt; The launch received some news coverage in March 2014.&lt;ref name=chicago-tribune/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaas.org/news/scicast-predict-tomorrow-today|title = SciCast - Predict Tomorrow, Today.

A '''semantics encoding''' is a translation between [[formal language]]s.  For programmers, the most familiar form of encoding is the compilation of a programming language into machine code or byte-code. Conversion between document formats are also forms of encoding. Compilation of [[TeX]] or [[LaTeX]] documents to [[PostScript]] are also commonly encountered encoding processes. Some high-level preprocessors such as [[OCaml]]'s [[Camlp4]] also involve encoding of a programming language into another.

Formally, an encoding of a language A into language B is a mapping of all terms of A into B. If there is a ''satisfactory'' encoding of A into B, B is considered ''at least as powerful'' (or ''at least as expressive'') as A.

== Properties ==

An informal notion of translation is not sufficient to help determine expressivity of languages, as it permits trivial encodings such as mapping all elements of A to the same element of B. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the definition of a "good enough" encoding. This notion varies with the application. 

Commonly, an encoding &lt;math&gt;[\cdot]: A \longrightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; is expected to preserve a number of properties.

=== Preservation of compositions ===

; soundness : For every n-ary operator &lt;math&gt;op_A&lt;/math&gt; of A, there exists an n-ary operator &lt;math&gt;op_B&lt;/math&gt; of B such that
:&lt;math&gt;\forall T_A^1,T_A^2,\dots,T_A^n, [op_A(T_A^1,T_A^2,\cdots,T_A^n)] = op_B([T_A^1],[T_A^2],\cdots,[T_A^n])&lt;/math&gt;
; completeness : For every n-ary operator &lt;math&gt;op_A&lt;/math&gt; of A, there exists an n-ary operator &lt;math&gt;op_B&lt;/math&gt; of B such that
:&lt;math&gt;\forall T_B^1,T_B^2,\dots,T_B^n, \exists  T_A^1,\dots,T_A^n, op_B(T_B^1,\cdots,T_B^N) = [op_A(T_A^1,T_A^2,\cdots,T_A^n)]&lt;/math&gt;

(Note: as far as the author is aware of, this criterion of completeness is never used.)

Preservation of compositions is useful insofar as it guarantees that components can be examined either separately or together without "breaking" any interesting property. In particular, in the case of compilations, this soundness guarantees the possibility of proceeding with separate compilation of components, while completeness guarantees the possibility of de-compilation.

=== Preservation of reductions ===

This assumes the existence of a notion of reduction on both language A and language B. Typically, in the case of a programming language, reduction is the relation which models the execution of a program.

We write &lt;math&gt;\longrightarrow&lt;/math&gt; for one step of reduction and &lt;math&gt;\longrightarrow^*&lt;/math&gt; for any number of steps of reduction.

; soundness : For every terms &lt;math&gt;T_A^1, T_A^2&lt;/math&gt; of language A, if &lt;math&gt;T_A^1 \longrightarrow^* T_A^2&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;[T_A^1] \longrightarrow^* [T_A^2]&lt;/math&gt;.
; completeness : For every term &lt;math&gt;T_A^1&lt;/math&gt; of language A and every terms &lt;math&gt;T_B^2&lt;/math&gt; of language B, if &lt;math&gt;[T_A^1] \longrightarrow^* T_B^2&lt;/math&gt; then there exists some &lt;math&gt;T_A^2&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;T_B^2 = [T_A^2]&lt;/math&gt;.

This preservation guarantees that both languages behave the same way. Soundness guarantees that all possible behaviours are preserved while completeness guarantees that no behaviour is added by the encoding. In particular, in the case of compilation of a programming language, soundness and completeness together mean that the compiled program behaves accordingly to the high-level semantics of the programming language. 

=== Preservation of termination ===

This also assumes the existence of a notion of reduction on both language A and language B.

; soundness : for any term &lt;math&gt;T_A&lt;/math&gt;, if all reductions of &lt;math&gt;T_A&lt;/math&gt; converge, then all reductions of &lt;math&gt;[T_A]&lt;/math&gt; converge.
; completeness : for any term &lt;math&gt;[T_A]&lt;/math&gt;, if all reductions of &lt;math&gt;[T_A]&lt;/math&gt; converge, then all reductions of &lt;math&gt;T_A&lt;/math&gt; converge.

In the case of compilation of a programming language, soundness guarantees that the compilation does not introduce non-termination such as endless loops or endless recursions. The completeness property is useful when language B is used to study or test a program written in language A, possibly by extracting key parts of the code: if this study or test proves that the program terminates in B, then it also terminates in A.

=== Preservation of observations ===

This assumes the existence of a notion of observation on both language A and language B. In programming languages, typical observables are results of inputs and outputs, by opposition to pure computation. In a description language such as [[HTML]], a typical observable is the result of page rendering.

; soundness : for every observable &lt;math&gt;obs_A&lt;/math&gt; on terms of A, there exists an observable &lt;math&gt;obs_B&lt;/math&gt; of terms of B such that for any term &lt;math&gt;T_A&lt;/math&gt; with observable &lt;math&gt;obs_A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;[T_A]&lt;/math&gt; has observable &lt;math&gt;obs_B&lt;/math&gt;.
; completeness : for every observable &lt;math&gt;obs_A&lt;/math&gt; on terms of A, there exists an observable &lt;math&gt;obs_B&lt;/math&gt; on terms of B such that for any term &lt;math&gt;[T_A]&lt;/math&gt; with observable &lt;math&gt;obs_B&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T_A&lt;/math&gt; has observable &lt;math&gt;obs_A&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Preservation of simulations ===

This assumes the existence of notion of simulation on both language A and language B. In a programming languages, a program simulates another if it can perform all the same (observable) tasks and possibly some others. Simulations are used typically to describe compile-time optimizations.

; soundness : for every terms &lt;math&gt;T_A^1, T_A^2&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;T_A^2&lt;/math&gt; simulates &lt;math&gt;T_A^1&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;[T_A^2]&lt;/math&gt; simulates &lt;math&gt;[T_A^1]&lt;/math&gt;.
; completeness : for every terms &lt;math&gt;T_A^1, T_A^2&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;[T_A^2]&lt;/math&gt; simulates &lt;math&gt;[T_A^1]&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;T_A^2&lt;/math&gt; simulates &lt;math&gt;T_A^1&lt;/math&gt;.

Preservation of simulations is a much stronger property than preservation of observations, which it entails. In turn, it is weaker than a property of preservation of [[bisimulation]]s. As in previous cases, soundness is important for compilation, while completeness is useful for testing or proving properties.

=== Preservation of equivalences ===

This assumes the existence of a notion of equivalence on both language A and language B. Typically, this can be a notion of equality of structured data or a notion of syntactically different yet semantically identical programs, such as structural congruence or structural equivalence. 

; soundness : if two terms &lt;math&gt;T_A^1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_A^2&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent in A, then &lt;math&gt;[T_A^1]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[T_A^2]&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent in B.
; completeness : if two terms &lt;math&gt;[T_A^1]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[T_A^2]&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent in B, then &lt;math&gt;T_A^1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_A^2&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent in A.

=== Preservation of distribution  ===
This assumes the existence of a notion of distribution on both language A and language B. Typically, for compilation of distributed programs written in [[Acute (programming language)|Acute]], [[JoCaml]] or E, this means distribution of processes and data among several computers or CPUs.

; soundness : if a term &lt;math&gt;T_A&lt;/math&gt; is the composition of two agents &lt;math&gt;T_A^1~|~T_A^2&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;[T_A]&lt;/math&gt; must be the composition of two agents &lt;math&gt;[T_A^1]~|~[T_A^2]&lt;/math&gt;.
; completeness : if a term &lt;math&gt;[T_A]&lt;/math&gt; is the composition of two agents &lt;math&gt;T_B^1~|~T_B^2&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;T_B&lt;/math&gt; must be the composition of two agents &lt;math&gt;T_A^1~|~T_A^2&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;[T_A^1]=T_B^1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[T_A^2]=T_B^2&lt;/math&gt;.

A '''set dresser''' in drama (theater, film etc.) prepares the [[Theatrical scenery|set]] with [[Theatrical property|prop]]s and furniture to give it correct appearance and make sure each item is in correct position for each performance.

==In film==
Set dressers arrange objects on a [[film set]] before shooting. They work under the direction of a leadman and the Set Decorator.  Set dressers place furniture, hang pictures, and put out decorative items.  They are also responsible for some light construction and assembly of small items, such as air-conditioning ducts.  They also move items as necessary to make room for the filming equipment. During the shoot, the prop department works with an on-set dresser to ensure that the props and [[furnishing]] are in the proper location for the script and to maintain [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]], as scenes are often shot out of order.

==In theater==
Set dressers "dress" the set of a play. Set dressers specifically deal with items on stage that are not interacted with by actors. Often set dressers are in charge of finding and installing curtains, wallpaper, photos, bedspreads, rugs and other items onto the set.
Set dressers are sometimes a part of the props department, [[set construction|construction]] department or their own department. Whether set dressing is its own department is often dependent on how much money a theater has. Set dressers also often have a lot of cross over work with the props department or construction department.
The set dressing department works under the director, producer and [[scenic designer]].

==Early life and education==
Born in 1937 in village Mahanga, situated on the banks of Chitrotpala, a tributary of the great [[Mahanadi River|Mahanadi]],&lt;ref name=jp&gt;[[#Ja|Jnanpith, p. 19]]&lt;/ref&gt; Sitakant Mahapatra grew up reciting a chapter of [[Odia language|Odia]] version of [[Bhagwad Gita]] in a traditional household. After his schooling from Korua government high school, he chose to join [[Ravenshaw College]], [[Cuttack]] (then affiliated with [[Utkal University]]), where he did his B.A. in History Honours 1957, this was followed by master's degree in Political Science from [[Allahabad University]] in 1959. During that time, he was the editor of the university journal. It was here that he started writing both in English and Odia, though later he decided to write poetry solely in his native. His scholastic works, however, are in English.&lt;ref name=ip&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/unveiling-of-a-poet/39127/0|title=Unveiling of a poet|date=3 March 2002 |publisher=The Financial Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=u/&gt;

In 1969, he did a Dip. Overseas Development Studies at [[Cambridge University]], under the Colombo Plan Fellowship.&lt;ref name=ip/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mumbai.mtnl.net.in/~hbfc/cv/DR_SITAKANT_MAHAPATRA.html Dr. Sitakant Mahapatra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220225910/http://mumbai.mtnl.net.in/~hbfc/cv/DR_SITAKANT_MAHAPATRA.html |date=20 February 2010 }} Mumbai MTNL&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, in 1988 he spent a year at [[Harvard University]] as a participant in the [[Ford Foundation]] fellowship program.

==Career==
He took to teaching for two years at Post-Graduate Department of [[Utkal University]], before taking the [[Indian Administrative Service]]s (IAS) examination.

He joined the IAS in 1961 as the first Odia to top the statewide examination, and went on to hold several key post, including Secretary, Ministry of Culture, Government of India, and President, [[UNESCO]]'s World Decade for Cultural Development (1994–1996). .
He has held many other ''ex officio'' positions including those of Senior Fellow of Harvard University; Honorary Fellow of International Academy of Poets, Cambridge University, and Chairman of the National Book Trust, New Delhi.&lt;ref name=u&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/lr/2006/01/01/stories/2006010100150300.htm|title=Universal appeal |date=1 January 2006|publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the recipient of many awards including the Orissa Sahitya Academy Award, 1971 and 1984; Sahitya Akademi Award, 1974; Sarala Award, 1985; culminating in India's highest literary honour the Jnanpith Award in 1993.

His first collection of poetry in [[Odia language|Odia]], ''Dipti O Dyuti'' was published in 1963, his second anthology, ''Ashtapadi'' came out in 1967, and won him the Odisha Sahitya Academy award, while his third and most celebrated anthology, ''Sara Akash'' (1971), got him the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]], given by [[Sahitya Akademi]], India's National Academy of Letters.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; Since then he has published over 350 poems in Odia and about 30 publications in English on [[literary criticism]] and culture. He spent two years studying tribals of Eastern India on a [[Homi J. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]] Fellowship (1975–1977).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ja|Jnanpith, p. 20]]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also two books on [[social anthropology]] published by the Oxford University Press, these books deal with the ambivalent relationship between the old ritual based society and state-sponsored development, and explores the reason behind developmental programs failing in tribal areas despite state efforts. Close ties with the tribals, and his fluency with the [[Santal]] tribal culture and the [[Santali language]] has led to the publication of nine [[anthology|anthologies]] of [[oral poetry]] of the tribals, which he not only collected, but also translated.&lt;ref name=ip/&gt;

Among notable works are: ''Ashtapad''i, 1963, ''Shabdara akasha'', 1971, Ara drushya, 1981, ''Shrestha kavita'', 1994, (all poetry); ''Sabda'', ''Svapna O nirvikata'', 1990 (essays), ''Aneka sarata'', 1981 (travelogue); ''Ushavilasa'', 1996 (palm leaf manuscript); In English: ''The ruined Temple and other poems'', 1996 (poetry, translation); and ''Unending Rhythms'' (Oral poetry of Indian Tribals in translation).

In 1974, lyricist and writer [[Prafulla Kar]] described the works of Mahapatra as part of  the "new poetry" in [[Odisha]] expressing a "contemporary consciousness" of Odia culture amidst an increasingly "urbanized and technological environment." According to Kar, Mahapatra addresses philosophical problems of human existence with an "awakening of a new kind of spiritual identification with the past" in search of "new values" with which to make sense of a "chaotic existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-link=Prafulla Kar |date=January–June 1974 |title=The Poetry of Sitakant Mahapatra |jstor= 23329846 |journal=[[Indian Literature]] |volume=17 |issue=1/2 |pages=43–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Cristina Moreno ([[Shelbie Bruce]]) is applying to [[Princeton University]]. For her application essay, she tells the story of a year from her childhood, and how it shaped the person she has become today (narrated by [[Aimee Garcia]]).

Flor Moreno ([[Paz Vega]]) is a poor [[Mexican people|Mexican]] single mother who moved to America (traveling "[[Illegal immigration to the United States|economy class]]" according to Cristina's essay) years earlier seeking a better life for her and her daughter, Cristina. She takes on two jobs, but soon cannot maintain them, so Flor's cousin takes her to a job interview to work as a [[nanny]] for the Clasky family, consisting of John ([[Adam Sandler]]) and Deborah ([[Téa Leoni]]), their children Bernice ([[Sarah Steele]]) and Georgie (Ian Hayland), and Deborah's mother Evelyn Wright ([[Cloris Leachman]]). John is a successful [[chef]] and an easy-going man who enjoys cooking and spending time with his children, while Deborah is a former businesswoman turned stay-at-home mother, and Evelyn is slowly developing into an alcoholic. Deborah is uptight and her neurotic behavior often upsets the family - Deborah mentally abuses her daughter, body shaming Bernice by forcing her to exercise, buying her smaller-sized clothes and putting her down for certain behaviors; she frustrates John by expecting him to be submissive and accepting of her parenting style with Georgie. John is more laid back and supports the mental well-being of his children, but he feels that he cannot stand up to Deborah, and so usually decides to let her be.

Soon, Flor is needed to be a full time nanny at the Claskys' home for the summer. Unable to communicate well in English, Deborah finds a neighbor to translate, and Flor admits she is unable to maintain these hours because she has a daughter. Out of desperation to keep Flor as their nanny, Deborah invites Cristina to come stay with them, to act as interpreter for her mother. Deborah immediately becomes attached to Cristina since she is beautiful and thin, and begins to treat her more like a daughter than Bernice. The clothes and gifts which Deborah buys for Cristina do not go unnoticed by Flor, who does not approve. Needing to get materials for a project that he is working on, John gives the children a small task, in which they will receive money in exchange for various pieces of glass they collect from the beach. Cristina takes the task seriously and ends up receiving $640 for her collection. Flor finds out about this, and is overwhelmed and angry at the large sum of money given to her daughter. Flor and John argue, with Cristina as the interpreter, and Flor wants to leave because of the awkward family dynamic. John coaxes her into staying, much to Cristina's delight, and Flor begins to learn English so she can better communicate with the Claskys.

In the meantime, John opens a new restaurant, but falls into a temporary depression because of the stress of the business, while Deborah begins an affair. Deborah enrolls Cristina into a private school with Bernice, upsetting Flor, who wants Cristina to keep in touch with her Mexican roots and working-class values. Flor feels that her employer is overstepping her bounds and voices her objection to John, who tells her he is also frustrated with Deborah because Bernice has no support system from her own mother. Flor tries to encourage Bernice and build her self-confidence, by showing her small acts of kindness, especially after Deborah has been hard on her.

Summer ends and Cristina and Bernice attend their first day of school together. That afternoon, Cristina is allowed to bring her school friends back to the Claskys' house; however, Bernice is not. Flor, who had not given permission for this, is upset at the situation and Deborah tries to cover for Cristina. The now-sober Evelyn realizes that her daughter is having an affair and that her marriage is in trouble. She pleads with Deborah to end the affair, telling her she will never get another man as good as John. Deborah confesses to John that she cheated on him and begs him to stay so that they can work things out; however, a dejected John walks out and bumps into Flor, who was about to inform him that she is quitting. He offers to give Flor a ride to the bus stop, but the pair end up going to his restaurant, where he cooks for Flor. They have a genuine and deep conversation, and become closer, but Flor is afraid of the consequences of a relationship, since they both have children. Flor tells John that she has feelings for him, but leaves before he can kiss her. A desperate Deborah continuously tries to contact John, but Evelyn prevents her from doing so. Evelyn says that her own failings as a parent have caused Deborah to become the person that she is, and the two have a frank conversation during which they become closer as mother and daughter.

Flor decides to quit and take her daughter home, which angers Cristina, who got along well with the Claskys. As they are about to leave, John tells Flor that he envies whoever will get to have her in the future, before parting ways forever. On their way home, Flor tells Cristina that she cannot attend to the private school anymore, upsetting Cristina even more. She screams in the middle of the street, accusing Flor of ruining her life. Flor loses patience with Cristina after she asks her mother for 'space', similar to the Claskys avoiding each other and asking for space when they cannot solve a problem. Flor explains to her daughter that it is time she answers the most important question of her life: "Is what you want for yourself, to become someone very different than me?" Cristina considers this on their bus ride home, and they make up and embrace.

Cristina, in her university essay, acknowledges that her life rests firmly and happily on the simple fact that she is her mother's daughter.

==Production==
Brooks cast Sandler after seeing his more dramatic performance in ''[[Punch-Drunk Love]]''.&lt;ref name="worry"&gt;{{cite web |first = Steve |last = Daly |title = What, Him Worry? |url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,767672,00.html |work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] |date = November 12, 2004 |accessdate = August 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vega could not speak English when filming began and a translator was on set during filming so that she could communicate with the director.&lt;ref name="worry" /&gt;

Leachman replaced [[Anne Bancroft]], who dropped out of the part after four weeks of shooting because of illness.&lt;ref name="worry" /&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film received mixed reviews. Based on 165 reviews collected by the film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 53% of critics gave ''Spanglish'' a positive review, with critical consensus being "Paz Vega shines, and Adam Sandler gives a performance of thoughtfulness and depth, but ''Spanglish'' is ultimately undermined by sitcommy plotting and unearned uplift."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Spanglish (2004) |url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spanglish/ |publisher = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate = August 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its proponents claim it is a moving portrayal of the difficulty of family problems and self-identity (and perhaps to a lesser extent the difficulties and rewards of [[cross-cultural communication]]). Advocates of the film found the intense sexual chemistry between Leoni and Sandler particularly compelling. Some critics described the film as "uneven",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Uneven-Spanglish-has-good-moments-2663230.php&lt;/ref&gt; "awkward" (where John and Flor attempt to bare their souls to one another...[with] lots of words coming out of their mouths, but there doesn’t seem to be a context),&lt;ref&gt;http://aisleseat.com/spanglish.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and "The supporting performers deserve better, especially... Cloris Leachman, who's consigned to a demeaning role...[and] the butt of rather mean-spirited jokes."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700003717/Spanglish.html?pg=all&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Big Sleep''''' (1939) is a [[hardboiled]] [[crime novel]] by [[Raymond Chandler]], the first to feature the detective [[Philip Marlowe]]. It has been adapted for film twice, [[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|in 1946]] and again [[The Big Sleep (1978 film)|in 1978]]. The story is set in Los Angeles.

The story is noted for its complexity, with characters double-crossing one another and secrets being exposed throughout the narrative. The title is a euphemism for death; it refers to a rumination about "sleeping the big sleep" in the final pages of the book.

In 1999, the book was voted 96th of ''[[Le Monde]]''{{'}}s "[[Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century|100 Books of the Century]]". In 2005, it was included in ''Time'' magazine's "[[TIME's List of the 100 Best Novels|List of the 100 Best Novels]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=All Time 100 Novels | work=Time | date= 16 October 2005 | accessdate=25 May 2010 | url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/0,24459,the_big_sleep,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[Private investigator]] [[Philip Marlowe]] is called to the home of the wealthy and elderly General Sternwood, in the month of October. He wants Marlowe to deal with an attempt by a bookseller named Arthur Geiger to blackmail his wild young daughter, Carmen. She had previously been blackmailed by a man named Joe Brody. Sternwood mentions his other, older daughter Vivian is in a loveless marriage with a man named Rusty Regan, who has disappeared. On Marlowe's way out, Vivian wonders if he was hired to find Regan, but Marlowe will not say.

Marlowe investigates Geiger's bookstore and meets Agnes, the clerk. He determines the store is a pornography lending library. He follows Geiger home, stakes out his house, and sees Carmen Sternwood enter. Later, he hears a scream followed by gunshots and two cars speeding away. He rushes in to find Geiger dead and Carmen drugged and naked, in front of an empty camera. He takes her home but when he returns, Geiger's body is gone. He quickly leaves. The next day, the police call him and let him know the Sternwoods' car was found driven off a pier, with their chauffeur dead inside. It appears that he was hit on the head before the car entered the water. The police also ask if Marlowe is looking for Regan.

Marlowe stakes out the bookstore and sees its inventory being moved to Joe Brody's home. Vivian comes to his office and says Carmen is being blackmailed with the nude photos from the previous night. She also mentions gambling at the casino of Eddie Mars and volunteers that Eddie's wife, Mona, ran off with Rusty. Marlowe revisits Geiger's house and finds Carmen trying to get in. They look for the photos, but she plays dumb about the night before. Eddie Mars suddenly enters; he says he is Geiger's landlord and is looking for him. Mars demands to know why Marlowe is there; Marlowe takes no notice and states he is no threat to Mars.

Marlowe goes to Brody's home and finds him with Agnes, the bookstore clerk. He tells them he knows they are taking over the lending library and blackmailing Carmen with the nude photos. Carmen forces her way in with a gun and demands the photos, but Marlowe takes her gun and makes her leave. Marlowe interrogates Brody further and pieces together the story: Geiger was blackmailing Carmen; the family driver, Owen Taylor, didn't like it so he snuck in and killed Geiger, then took the film of Carmen. Brody was staking out the house too and pursued the driver, knocked him out, stole the film, and possibly pushed the car off the pier. Suddenly the doorbell rings and Brody is shot dead; Marlowe gives chase and catches Geiger's male lover, who shot Brody thinking he killed Geiger. He had also hidden Geiger's body, so he could remove his own belongings before the police got wind of the murder.

The case is over, but Marlowe is nagged by Regan's disappearance. The police accept that he simply ran off with Mona Mars, since she is also missing, and since Eddie Mars wouldn't risk committing a murder in which he would be the obvious suspect. Mars calls Marlowe to his casino and seems to be nonchalant about everything. Vivian is also there, and Marlowe senses something between her and Mars. He drives her home and she tries to seduce him, but he rejects her advances. When he gets home, he finds Carmen has snuck into his bed, and he rejects her, too.

A man named Harry Jones, who is Agnes's new partner, approaches Marlowe and offers to sell him the location of Mona Mars. Marlowe plans to meet him later, but Mars's henchman Canino is suspicious of Jones and Agnes's intentions and kills Jones first. Marlowe manages to meet Agnes anyway and receives the information. He goes to the location in Realito, a repair shop with a home in back, but Canino, with the help of Art Huck, the garage man, jumps him and knocks him out. When he awakens, he is tied up, and Mona Mars is there with him. She says she hasn't seen Rusty in months; she only hid out to help Eddie and insists he didn't kill Rusty. She frees him, and he shoots and kills Canino.

The next day, Marlowe visits General Sternwood, who remains curious about Rusty's whereabouts and offers Marlowe an additional $1,000 fee if he is able to locate him. On the way out, Marlowe returns Carmen's gun to her, and she asks him to teach her how to shoot. They go to an abandoned field, where she tries to kill him, but he has loaded the gun with blanks and merely laughs at her; the shock causes Carmen to have an epileptic seizure. Marlowe brings her back and tells Vivian he has guessed the truth: Carmen came on to Rusty and he spurned her, so she killed him. Eddie Mars, who had been backing Geiger, helped Vivian conceal it by first helping to dispose of Rusty's body, inventing a story about his wife running off with Rusty and then blackmailing her himself. Vivian says she did it to keep it all from her father so he wouldn't despise his own daughters, and promises to have Carmen institutionalised.

With the case now over, Marlowe goes to a local bar and orders several double Scotches. While drinking, he begins to think about Mona "Silver-Wig" Mars. He never sees her again.

==Background==
''The Big Sleep'', like most of Chandler's novels, was written by what he called "cannibalizing" his short stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacShane|first=Frank|title=The Life of Raymond Chandler|year=1976|publisher=E.P. Dutton|location=New York|isbn=0-525-14552-4|pages=67|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chandler would take stories he had already published in the pulp magazine ''[[Black Mask (magazine)|Black Mask]]'' and rework them into a coherent novel. For ''The Big Sleep'', the two main stories that form the core of the novel are "Killer in the Rain" (published in 1935) and "The Curtain" (published in 1936). Although the stories were independent and shared no characters, they had some similarities that made it logical to combine them. In both stories there is a powerful father who is distressed by his wayward daughter. Chandler merged the two fathers into a new character and did the same for the two daughters, resulting in General Sternwood and his wild daughter Carmen. Chandler also borrowed small parts of two other stories, "Finger Man" and "Mandarin's Jade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacShane|first=Frank|title=The Life of Raymond Chandler|year=1976|publisher=E.P. Dutton|location=New York|isbn=0-525-14552-4|pages=68|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As might be expected, all this cannibalising—especially in a time when cutting and pasting was done by cutting and pasting paper—sometimes produced a plot with a few loose ends. The famously unanswered question in ''The Big Sleep'' is who killed the chauffeur. When Howard Hawks [[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|filmed the novel]], his writing team was perplexed by that question, in response to which Chandler replied that he had no idea.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Jamie Hamilton, 21 March 1949. In Hiney, T. and MacShane, F. (2000). ''The Raymond Chandler Papers''. Atlantic Monthly Press p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; This exemplifies a difference between Chandler's style of crime fiction and that of previous authors. To Chandler, plot was less important than atmosphere and characterisation. An ending that answered every question while neatly tying every plot thread mattered less to Chandler than interesting characters with believable behaviour.

When Chandler merged his stories into a novel, he spent more effort on expanding descriptions of people, places, and Marlowe's thinking than getting every detail of the plot perfectly consistent. In "The Curtain", the description of Mrs. O'Mara's room is just enough to establish the setting: "This room had a white carpet from wall to wall. Ivory drapes of immense height lay tumbled casually on the white carpet inside the many windows. The windows stared towards the dark foot-hills, and the air beyond the glass was dark too. It hadn't started to rain yet, there was a feeling of pressure in the atmosphere." In ''The Big Sleep'', Chandler expanded this description of the room and used new detail (e.g., the contrast of white and "bled out", the coming rain) to foreshadow the fact that Mrs. Regan (Mrs. O'Mara in the original story) is covering up the murder of her husband by her sister and that the coming rainstorm will bring more deaths: "The room was too big, the ceiling was too high, the doors were too tall, and the white carpet that went from wall to wall looked like a fresh fall of snow at Lake Arrowhead. There were full-length mirrors and crystal doodads all over the place. The ivory furniture had chromium on it, and the enormous ivory drapes lay tumbled on the white carpet a yard from the windows. The white made the ivory look dirty and the ivory made the white look bled out. The windows stared towards the darkening foothills. It was going to rain soon. There was pressure in the air already."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacShane|first=Frank|title=The Life of Raymond Chandler|year=1976|publisher=E.P. Dutton|location=New York|isbn=0-525-14552-4|pages=68–69|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the historical plausibility of Geiger's character, Jay A. Gertzman wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Erotica dealers with experience had to be tough, although not necessarily predatory, and the business was not for the timid or scrupulous. But the criminality of erotica dealers did not extend beyond bookselling into organized racketeering; Al Capone and Meyer Lansky were not role models. A figure like A. G. Geiger, the dirty-books racketeer in Raymond Chandler's ''Big Sleep'' (1939) who supplements his business activities as owner of a pornographic lending library in Hollywood by arranging sex orgies and blackmailing rich customers, is a fascinating but lurid exaggeration. However susceptible film personalities were to blackmail, it was not the métier of book dealers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gertzman|first1=Jay A.|title=Bookleggers and Smuthounds: The Trade in Erotica 1920–1940|date=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=0-8122-1798-5|pages=35–37|edition=First paperback printing, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Transylvanian Saxon''' (Saxon: ''Siweberjesch-Såksesch'' or just ''Såksesch'', {{Lang-de|Siebenbürgisch-Sächsisch}} or ''Siebenbürgisch-Sächsische Sprache'', {{Lang-hu|Erdélyi szász nyelv}}, {{Lang-ro|Limba săsească/dialectul săsesc}}) is the German dialect of the [[Transylvanian Saxons]]. 

In terms of [[comparative linguistics]], it pertains to the [[Moselle Franconian dialects|Moselle Franconian]] group of [[West Central German]] dialects. In this particular respect, it must be stressed that it shares a consistent amount of lexical similarities with [[Luxembourgish]].

The dialect was mainly spoken in [[Transylvania]] (contemporary central [[Romania]]), by individuals of [[Germans|German]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]], and [[Walloons|Walloon]] origins who were settled in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] starting in the 12th century. 

In the contemporary era, the vast majority of the native speakers have emigrated in several waves, initially to [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], but then subsequently to the [[United States of America|USA]], Canada as well as other [[Western Europe|Western European]] countries, managing in the process to preserve (at least temporarily) their specific language there. 

Before the [[Romanian Revolution|Romanian Revolution of 1989]], most of the Transylvanian Saxons were still living in Transylvania. During the communist dictatorship of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], many thousands of these Saxons were sold per capita{{specify}} for a huge amount of money paid to socialist Romania by [[West Germany]]. 

By 1990, the number of Saxons living in Transylvania had decreased dramatically. Shortly after the fall of Communism, namely during the period of 1991—1994, many Transylvanian Saxons who still remained in Transylvania decided to ultimately emigrate to Germany, leaving just a minority of about 15,000 to 16,000 Transylvanian Saxons in Romania. 

The number of native Transylvanian Saxon speakers today is estimated at 200,000 persons. Transylvanian Saxon is also the native language of the current [[President of Romania]] [[Klaus Iohannis|Klaus Johannis]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7008">A '''victim impact statement''' is a written or oral statement made as part of the judicial legal process, which allows  [[crime]] victims the opportunity to speak during the [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] of the convicted person or at subsequent [[parole]] hearings. 

==Overview==
One purpose of the statement is to allow the person or persons most directly affected by the crime to address the court during the decision making process. It is seen to personalize the crime and elevate the status of the [[Victimology|victim]]. From the victim's point of view it is regarded as valuable in aiding their emotional recovery from their ordeal. It has also been suggested they may confront an offender with the results of their crime and thus aid [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]].

Another purpose of the statement is to inform a court of the harm suffered by the victim if the court is required to, or has the option of, having regard to the harm suffered by the victim in deciding the sentence.

In cases of crimes resulting in death, the right to speak is extended to family members. In some jurisdictions there are very different rules on how victim impact statements from family members may be regarded. This is because it is seen as unprincipled that different punishments for death are given according to the how much the victim is missed, or conversely that someone's death is relatively less harmful if they have no family. In the circumstance of death, some jurisdictions have described victim impact statements from family members as 'irrelevant' to sentence but not 'unimportant' to the process: they are valued for restorative purposes but cannot differentiate punishment for causing death.

In general terms, the person making the statement is allowed to discuss specifically the direct harm or trauma they have suffered and problems that have resulted from the crime such as loss of income. Some jurisdictions allow for attaching medical and psychiatric reports that demonstrate harm to the victim. They can also discuss the impact the crime has had on their ambitions or plans for the future, and how this also impacted their extended family.

Some jurisdictions permit statements to express what they deem to be an appropriate punishment or sentence for the criminal.

Some jurisdictions expressly forbid any proposal or suggestion on punishment or sentencing. Among other reasons, this is because the sentencing process is solely the domain of the judge who considers many more factors than harm to victims. Allowing suggestions on punishment or sentence can create a false hope of the eventual sentence and undermine the notion of restorative justice.

In civil cases, a victim impact statement may be used to determine how much is awarded to the plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=29+Law+%26+Psychol.+Rev.+211&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=5ec513b6b61397aa52e1cdc7e853616b&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The first such statement in the United States was presented in 1976 in [[Fresno, California]], and was passed as law in California in 1982,  because of [[Doris Tate]]'s concern that any members of the [[Manson family]] [[cult]] that killed her daughter, [[Sharon Tate]], in 1969 might obtain [[parole]].

In 1982, the Final Report of the ''President's Task Force on Victims of Crime'' recommended that "judges allow for, and give appropriate weight to, input at sentencing from victims of violent crime." In 1992, the [[United States Attorney General]] released 24 recommendations to strengthen the [[criminal justice system]]'s treatment of crime victims. The Attorney General endorsed the use of victim impact statements and stated that judges should "provide for hearing and considering the victims' perspective at sentencing and at any early release proceedings."

In 1991, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that a victim impact statement in the form of testimony was allowed during the sentencing phase of a trial in ''[[Payne v. Tennessee]]'' {{ussc|501|808|1991}}. It ruled that the admission of such statements did not violate the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and that the statements could be ruled as [[Admissible evidence|admissible]] in [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] cases.

By 1997, 44 of the American states allowed the presentation of victim impact statements during its official process, although until 1991 these statements were held as inadmissible in cases where the death penalty was sought. 

The law varies in different states, and while most states allow statements to be made during the sentencing phase of the trial, Indiana and Texas allow for statements to also be made after sentencing.

==Australia==
The State of [[South Australia]] enacted law in 1988 specifically providing for Victim Impact Statements in the sentencing process, and other States followed with legislation that either provides specifically or generally for the tendering of victim impact statements as part of the sentencing process.

Among current issues with victim impact statements is their relative newness and a lack of research into their actual effectiveness against their theoretical goals. There are occasionally legal issues surrounding the admissibility of facts in a victim impact statement that are materially adverse to an offender.

In the State of [[Government of Queensland#Courts and tribunals|Queensland]], the [[Director of Public Prosecution#Australia|Director of Public Prosecution]] guidelines require prosecutors to remove inappropriate or inflammatory material from Victim Impact Statements prior to them being submitted before a court to prevent any such issues.

==Finland==
In Finland, the victim has a right to recommend a punishment different from the one recommended by the prosecution.&lt;ref name="riutkm"&gt;Rikosuhritoimikunnan mietintö 19.6.2001&lt;/ref&gt;
