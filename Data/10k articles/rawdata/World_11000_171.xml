The '''Babylonian Map of the World''' (or ''Imago Mundi'') is a [[Babylonia|Babylonian]] [[clay tablet]]
containing a [[labeling (map design)|label]]ed depiction of the [[early world maps|known world]], with a short and partially lost description, dated to roughly the 6th century BC ([[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]] or early [[Achaemenid]] period).

The map is centered on the [[Euphrates]], flowing from the north (top) to the south (bottom). 
The city of [[Babylon]] is shown on the Euphrates, in the northern half of the map. The mouth of the Euphrates is labelled "swamp" and "outflow". [[Susa]], the capital of [[Elam]], is shown to the south, [[Urartu]] to the northeast, and Habban, the capital of the [[Kassites]] is shown (incorrectly) to the northwest. Mesopotamia is surrounded by a circular "bitter river" or [[Oceanus|Ocean]], and eight "regions", depicted as triangular sections, are shown as lying beyond the Ocean.
It has been suggested that the depiction of these "regions" as triangles might indicate that they were imagined as mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Lewy H., Lewy J., "The Origin of the Week and the Oldest West Asiatic Calendar", ''The Hebrew Union College Annual'' 17 (1943), 1—146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tablet was discovered at [[Sippar]], [[Baghdad Vilayet]], some 60&amp;nbsp;km north of Babylon on the east bank of the [[Euphrates River]]. The text was first translated in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;
F. E. Peiser ''ZA'' 4 (1889) 361-370. 
First publication of a photogaphic reproduction: C. Ball, ''Light from The East'' (1899), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The clay tablet resides at the [[British Museum]] (BM 92687).&lt;ref name=BM92687/&gt;

==Description of the mapped areas==
[[File:20180506 145606-babylon-map.jpg|thumb|]]

The map is circular with two outer defined circles. [[Cuneiform]] script labels all locations inside the circular map, as well as a few regions outside. The two outer circles represent water in between and is labelled as  &lt;sup&gt;id&lt;/sup&gt;''maratum'' "bitter river", the salt sea.
[[Babylon]] north of  center of the map; parallel lines at the bottom seem to represent the ''southern marshes'', and a curved line coming from the north, northeast appear to represent the [[Zagros Mountains]].&lt;ref name=Horowitz&gt;Edition of the text: 
Wayne Horowitz, ''Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography'' ch. 2 (1998) [=''Iraq'' 50 (1988), 147-165].
Older editions:
F.E. Peier ''ZA'' 4 (1889), R.C. Thompson, ''Cuneiform texts from Babylonian tablets'' 22 48  (1906), E. Weidner, BoSt 6 (1922) 85-93, E. Unger, ''Babylon'' (1931), 254-258.
&lt;/ref&gt;

There are seven small interior circles at the perimeter areas within the circle, and they appear to represent seven cities.
Eight triangular sections on the external circle (water perimeter) represent named "regions" (''nagu'').
The description of five of them has survived.&lt;ref name=BM92687&gt;[http://britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=362000&amp;partId=1 British Museum Inv. No.92687].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bartlow Hills''' is a [[Ancient_Rome|Roman]] [[Tumulus|tumuli]] cemetery in [[Bartlow]] ([[Cambridgeshire]], [[UK]]). Four of original seven barrows remain, but only the largest three are accessible to the public; the northernmost and smallest is on private property and not easily visible. The remnants of two more are visible as low mounds west of the three largest barrows. The tallest is 15 metres high, and the largest barrow north of the [[Alps]].&lt;ref name=hills&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/cambridgeshire/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8692000/8692856.stm|title=Bartlow Hills are a hidden Cambridgeshire treasure|date=20 May 2010|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Excavation_(archaeology)|Excavations]] were undertaken in the 19th century (chiefly in 1832–40), discovering remains of large wooden chests, decorated vessels in bronze, glass and pottery and an iron folding chair (most of which were lost in a fire at Easton Lodge in 1847&lt;ref&gt;http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=122410&lt;/ref&gt;). A small [[Roman villa]], occupied until the late 4th century, was situated north of the mounds and was excavated in 1852. The site saw no further work until a [[geophysical survey]] in 2006 and further excavations in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reading.ac.uk/web/FILES/archaeology/arch-Bartlow-2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During this work, it was not possible to locate the Roman villa.

The '''Battle of Gatae''' was an engagement fought in roughly 103 [[Anno Domini|AD]] during the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Trajan]]'s war with the kingdom of [[Dacia]].

There is no serious historical evidence giving an exact place or time to the battle, nor any troop positions, numerical statistics, casualties, or much of anything of that nature. It is not even fully understood if the battle was in of itself a major engagement or merely a small battle or even a large skirmish. [[Dio Cassius]] gives a minor mention of the battle, but it is a mere mention.

It is understood that this battle did, however, somehow break the back of the Dacian army and allow the [[Roman Legions]] to make serious tactical headway. However, [[Decebalus]], king of Dacia, managed to secure a peace before the capital of [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]] was captured.

'''CFRNA''' ("The French-Romanian Company for Air Transport"; {{lang-fr|Compagnie franco-roumaine de navigation aérienne}}; {{lang-ro|Compania franco-română de navigație aeriană}}), later '''CIDNA''' ("The International Air Navigation Company"; {{lang-fr|Compagnie internationale de navigation aérienne}}) was a [[French Third Republic|French]]-[[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] airline, [[Portal:Aviation/Historical anniversaries/January in aviation/January 1|founded]] on January 1, 1920.

Using French-built [[Potez]] aircraft, the company provided passenger, mail and cargo transportation, by air, from [[Paris]] to [[Bucharest]], via [[Strasbourg]], [[Prague]], [[Vienna]] and [[Budapest]]. As such, CFRNA was the first operative [[transcontinental flight|transcontinental]] airline in the history of aviation. The company also made the first passenger international night flight, between [[Belgrade]] and Bucharest in 1923. In 1925 CIDNA opened the first domestic Romanian route Bucharest - [[Galaţi]], followed, from 24 June 1926, by an extended service to [[Iaşi]] and [[Chişinău]].

In 1930, the Romanian arm adopted the name [[TAROM|LARES]] (''Liniile Aeriene Române Exploatate de Stat'' - ''State-Run Romanian Air Lines'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeanairlines.no/airline-companies-in-rumania-1918-1945/ Airline companies in Rumania (1918-1945)]&lt;/ref&gt; The company ceased to exist when it became one of the constituting companies of [[Air France]] on October 7, 1933.

It is identified as one of the busiest airports in the [[United States]], with traffic now exceeding 21 million passengers a year and rising.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;[http://www6.hawaii.gov/dot/airports/publications/cysmallone.pdf "The State of Hawaii Airport Activity Statistics By Year 2007-1994"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626142806/http://www6.hawaii.gov/dot/airports/publications/cysmallone.pdf |date=June 26, 2008 }}, ''Department of Transportation, Airports Division, State of Hawaii''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The airport is named after the U.S. Senator and [[Medal of Honor]] recipient [[Daniel Inouye|Daniel K. Inouye]], who represented Hawaii from 1963 until his death in 2012. The airport is located in the [[Honolulu]] [[census-designated place]] three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) northwest of Honolulu's central business district.&lt;ref name=FAA&gt;{{FAA-airport|ID=HNL|use=PU|own=PU|site=52161.*A}}, effective December 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/MapItDrawServlet?geo_id=16000US1517000&amp;_bucket_id=50&amp;tree_id=420&amp;context=saff&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on Honolulu CDP, HI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218201733/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/MapItDrawServlet?geo_id=16000US1517000&amp;_bucket_id=50&amp;tree_id=420&amp;context=saff&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on |date=February 18, 2008 }}."

Daniel K. Inouye International Airport serves as the principal hub of [[Hawaiian Airlines]], the largest Hawaii-based airline. It offers flights between the various airports of the [[Hawaiian Islands]] and also serves the [[continental United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[American Samoa]], [[Tahiti]], [[Japan]], [[China]], the [[Philippines]], and [[South Korea]]. It is host to major United States and international airlines, with direct flights to [[North America]]n, [[Asia]]n, and [[Pacific Rim]] destinations. In addition to services to most major western cities and many smaller gateways, especially in [[California]], the airport has succeeded in attracting long-haul services to the East Coast including the recently added destinations of [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Toronto–Pearson]] and [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington–Dulles]], which have joined established services to [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York–JFK]], and [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark]].

It is also the base for [[Aloha Air Cargo]], which previously offered both passenger and cargo services under the name [[Aloha Airlines]]. This airline ceased passenger flights on March 31, 2008, and sold off its cargo services to [[Seattle]]-based Saltchuk Resources, Inc. (also owners of inter-island sea-based shipping company Young Brothers and [[Hawaii]]an Tug &amp; Barge).

In 2012, the airport handled 19,291,412 passengers, 278,145 aircraft movements and processed 412,270 metric tons of cargo.&lt;ref name="pax&amp;move2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aci-na.org/sites/default/files/2012-top-50-na-airports.xls |title=2012 North American Airport Traffic Summary (Top 50 Airports – Passengers, Cargo, Movements) |publisher=Airports Council International |date= |accessdate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is included in the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) [[National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems]] for 2017–2021, in which it is [[FAA airport categories|categorized]] as a large-hub primary commercial service facility.&lt;ref name="NPIAS Airports"&gt;{{cite web|title=List of NPIAS Airports|url=https://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/npias/reports/media/NPIAS-Report-2017-2021-Appendix-A.pdf|website=FAA.gov|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|accessdate=23 December 2016|format=PDF|date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
HNL opened in March 1927 as '''John Rodgers Airport''', named after World War I naval officer [[John Rodgers (naval officer, World War I)|John Rodgers]].&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hawaii.gov/hawaiiaviation/publications/hnl-gateway-brochure/Airport-timeline-web.pdf |title=Honolulu International Airport...Celebrating 80 years |accessdate=January 12, 2009|year=2007 |format= PDF|work=Gateway to the Pacific: Honolulu International Airport 80th Anniversary |publisher=Hawaii Department of Transportation, Airports Division |quote=John Rodgers Airport was dedicated March 21, 1927. The field was named in honor of the late Commander John Rodgers, who had been Commanding Officer of the Naval Air Station at Pearl Harbor from 1923 and 1925...}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was funded by the territorial legislature and the Chamber of Commerce, and was the first full airport in Hawaii: aircraft had previously been limited to small landing strips, fields or seaplane docks. From 1939 to 1943, the adjacent Keehi Lagoon was dredged for use by seaplanes, and the dredged soil was moved to HNL to provide more space for conventional airplanes.

The U.S. military grounded all civil aircraft and took over all civil airports after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], and Rodgers Field was designated '''Naval Air Station Honolulu'''. The Navy built a control tower and terminal building, and some commercial traffic was allowed during daylight hours. Rodgers Field was returned to the [[Territory of Hawaii]] in 1946. At the time, at {{convert|4019|acre|km2}}, it was one of the largest airports in the United States, with four paved land runways and three seaplane runways.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;

John Rodgers Airport was renamed Honolulu Airport in 1947; "International" was added to the name in 1951.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; Being near the center of the Pacific Ocean it was a stop for many transpacific flights. By 1950 it was the third-busiest airport in the United States in terms of aircraft operations, and its {{convert|13097|ft|m|adj=on}} runway was the longest in the world in 1953.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; In summer of 1959 [[Qantas]] began the first jet service to Honolulu on its flights between Australia and California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hawaii.gov/hnl/airport-information/hnl-1960-1969 |title=HNL 1960–1969 |accessdate=July 8, 2009|year=2007 |publisher=Hawaii Department of Transportation, Airports Division}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qantas introduced these jet flights with [[Boeing 707]] aircraft operating a routing of Sydney - Fiji - Honolulu - San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timetableimages.com, Nov. 6, 1959 Qantas system timetable&lt;/ref&gt;  Aeronautical engineer and airline consultant, Frank Der Yuen, advised in the design of the original building and founded its aerospace museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rainengineering.com/acknowledgments.html |title=ACKNOWLEDGMENTS: A detailed review of participants in and their contributions to etheric rain engineering since 1968 | author=Trevor James Constable |accessdate=July 8, 2009|year=2008 |publisher=Etheric Rain Engineering Pte.

===Modernization and history since 2006===
On March 24, 2006, [[Hawaii Governor]] [[Linda Lingle]] unveiled a $2.3 billion modernization program for Hawaii airports over a 12-year period, with $1.7 billion budgeted for Honolulu International Airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hawaiiairportsmodernization.com/12/about-the-program | title=About the Program | publisher = Hawaii Airports Modernization Project | accessdate = July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan involves implementing short-term projects within the first five years to improve passenger service and increase security and operational efficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=$2.3B airports upgrade proposed | work=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] | url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2006/03/25/news/story05.html | first=B.J. | last=Reyes | date=March 25, 2006 | accessdate=October 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the modernization, flight display monitors throughout the airport have been upgraded, new food and beverage vendors have been added, and a new parking garage across from the International Arrivals terminal has been completed. Current projects include an international arrivals corridor with moving sidewalks built atop the breezeway leading to the Ewa Concourse. The first phase of the project was completed in October 2009, while the remainder of the two phase project was completed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=New International Arrivals Corridor Opens at Honolulu International Airport | publisher = Office of the Governor | url=http://hawaii.gov/gov/news/files/2009/october/hnl | accessdate = January 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Hawaiian Airlines renovated the check-in lobby of the Interisland Terminal, replacing the traditional check-in counters with six circular check-in islands in the middle of the lobbies, which can be used for inter-island, mainland, and international flights. This renovation project was fully funded by Hawaiian Airlines and not a part of the modernization program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staradvertiser.com/business/20110331__Hawaiian_Airlines_overhauls_lobbies.html] [[Hawaiian Airlines]]&lt;span&gt; renovating inter-island terminal check-in lobby at Honolulu International Airport&lt;/span&gt;, Honolulu Star Advertiser retrieved March 31, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Future projects include construction of a Mauka Concourse branching off the Interisland Terminal, the first concourse expansion at Honolulu International Airport in 15 years. Construction of the concourse will involve replacing the existing Commuter Terminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hawaiiairportsmodernization.com/3/what-were-doing-now | title=What We're Doing Now: Honolulu International Airport | publisher = Hawaii Airports Modernization Project | accessdate = July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new concourse will be for the exclusive use of Hawaiian Airlines, and will allow it to reduce use of overseas terminal gates for international and US mainland flights. This will mean less walking for passengers who check in, clear security, and use the baggage claim at the inter-island terminal. It will also free up gates in the overseas terminal for use by other airlines. Landside plans include construction of a consolidated rental car facility (CONRAC). A temporary rental car center is currently being built in the overseas parking garage so that the existing rental car facilities can be demolished to make way for the new permanent facility.

By 2012, Hawaiian Airlines was re-establishing Honolulu International Airport as a connecting hub between the [[United States]] mainland and the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Edward. "[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-honolulus-reascendant-connecting-hub-378236/ ANALYSIS: Honolulu's reascendant connecting hub]." ''[[Flightglobal]]''. October 30, 2012. Retrieved on October 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, according to a [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] study, the airport had 24% fewer domestic departure flights than it did in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

''[[Pacific Business News]]''. May 8, 2013. Retrieved on May 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2016 legislative session, the Hawaii state legislature passed a resolution requesting the Department of Transportation to rename Honolulu International Airport for the late U.S. Senator and [[Medal of Honor]] recipient [[Daniel Inouye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/Archives/measure_indiv_Archives.aspx?billtype=HCR&amp;billnumber=88&amp;year=2016|title=Hawaii State Legislature|website=www.capitol.hawaii.gov|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new name first appeared in Federal Aviation Administration documentation on April 27, 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://khon2.com/2017/04/28/honolulu-airport-renamed-after-late-sen-daniel-inouye/|title=Honolulu airport renamed after late Sen.

On June 1, 2018, the Department of Transportation started renumbering all gates and baggage claim numbers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HNL gates and baggage claims to receive new numbers beginning June 1, 2018 as part of the Airport Modernization Plan |url=http://hidot.hawaii.gov/airports/hnl-gates-and-baggage-claims-to-receive-new-numbers-beginning-june-1-2018-as-part-of-the-airport-modernization-plan/ |website=hidot.hawaii.gov |accessdate=1 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Gates were renamed alphanumerically and baggage claim numbers were renumbered from alphanumerical to numerical. The Hawaii Department of Transportation cited the expansion of existing terminals in the airport as a reason to renumber all gates and baggage claims.

Daniel K. Inouye International Airport has three terminals: Terminal 1, Terminal 2, and Terminal 3. The [[Wiki Wiki Shuttle]] provides inter-terminal transportation between the ticket lobbies of all three terminals and between the concourses in terminals 1 and 2. All gates in terminals 1 and 2 are connected post-security; however, passengers walking from Terminal 1 to gates in Terminal 2 must pass through a USDA agricultural inspection station for carry-on luggage.

Effective June 1, 2018, the gate numbers at Daniel K. Inouye International Airport were renamed to an alphanumeric format, and the baggage claim numbers (formerly alphanumeric) were renumbered to numeric. These changes are intended to accommodate expansion with the new Mauka and Diamond Head concourses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.khon2.com/news/local-news/new-gate-numbers-slated-for-daniel-k-inouye-airport/1174582688|title=New gate numbers slated for Daniel K.

===Terminal 1===
Terminal 1, formerly known as the “Interisland Terminal,” opened in 1993. The $130 million 8-gate terminal was the largest construction project undertaken at that time by the State Airports Division and replaced an earlier terminal built in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aviation.hawaii.gov/airfields-airports/oahu/honolulu-international-airport/hnl-1990s/|title=Hawaii Aviation  {{!}}  HNL 1990s|website=aviation.hawaii.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, a 5-gate extension to the terminal, which also featured a new post-security walkway to Terminal 2 (formerly known as the “Overseas Terminal”) opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aviation.hawaii.gov/airfields-airports/oahu/honolulu-international-airport/hnl-1990s/|title=Hawaii Aviation  {{!}}  HNL 1990s|website=aviation.hawaii.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fixed-base operators===
A number of [[fixed-base operator (aviation)|fixed-base operator]]s are located along Lagoon Drive on the airport's southeastern perimeter. While these focus on general aviation services, there are a few small passenger airline operations that operate from these facilities, rather than from the main terminal complex. Air tour flights typically depart from this area as well.

==Traffic and statistics==
The largest airline at Honolulu airport is Hawaiian Airlines offering 13,365 seats per day, which represents a 45% market share. The No. 2 and No. 3 carriers are United and Japan Airlines (JAL) with 7.7% and 7.4% market share respectively.

Traffic between Honolulu and the [[mainland United States]] is dominated by flights to and from [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]]. These two cities, plus [[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport|Seattle]], account for around half of all flights between the mainland and [[Honolulu]]. Hawaiian Airlines, with 11 routes, has the highest market share on routes between Honolulu and the continental United States.&lt;ref name="anna"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.anna.aero/2008/09/19/not-so-happy-hawaii-sees-capacity-drop-by-30-percent/| title=Hawaiian Airlines poised to expand partnerships with Asian carriers, boosting Honolulu’s hub status| date=September 19, 2008| publisher=anna.aero}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.anna.aero/2008/09/19/not-so-happy-hawaii-sees-capacity-drop-by-30-percent/| title=Hawaiian Airlines poised to expand partnerships with Asian carriers, boosting Honolulu’s hub status| date=September 8, 2014| publisher=CAPA Centre for Aviation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally, Japan is the dominant market. Two-thirds of international seats head for [[Chūbu Centrair International Airport|Nagoya]], [[Kansai International Airport|Osaka]], and Tokyo (both [[Tokyo Haneda|Haneda]] and [[Tokyo Narita|Narita]] airports) with services provided by [[Japan Airlines]], [[Air Japan]], [[China Airlines]], [[Korean Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]], [[Hawaiian Airlines|Hawaiian]], or [[United Airlines|United]]. [[Narita International Airport|Narita]] alone is served with 61 weekly departures and is the second busiest international route from the United States, trailing only the lucrative [[John F. Kennedy Airport]]-[[London Heathrow]] route.&lt;ref name="anna"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = U.S. International Passenger and Freight Statistics| year = 2013| publisher = USDoT| ref = {{harvid|USDoT|2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major international routes are to [[Seoul]] (25 weekly departures operated by [[Korean Airlines]], [[Asiana Airlines]], [[Hawaiian Airlines|Hawaiian]], and [[Jin Air]]), Sydney (12 weekly departures operated by Hawaiian, [[Jetstar]] and [[Qantas]]) and [[Vancouver]] (19 weekly departures split between [[Air Canada]] and [[Westjet]]).

In October 2009, China-based [[Hainan Airlines]] was granted approval for a nonstop flight from [[Honolulu]] to Beijing.&lt;ref name="Honolulu-Beijing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hainan Air approved for Honolulu-Beijing service |accessdate=January 25, 2013 |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2009-10-12-hainan-air-honolulu_N.htm |first=Robbie |last=Dingeman |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DvUri1oW?url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2009-10-12-hainan-air-honolulu_N.htm |archivedate=January 25, 2013 |date=October 12, 2009 |work=[[USA Today]] |location=Tysons Corner, VA, United States |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would be the first mainland Chinese carrier to serve Hawaii and the airline's second US destination after [[Seattle]].

==1973–1986==
{{main|Economic History of the Philippines under Ferdinand Marcos}}
After experiencing years of positive growth, the '''Philippine economy between 1973 and 1986''' suffered a downturn due to a mixture of domestic and international problems.  Those were the years the country was under [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and [[martial law]], witnessed the assassination of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]], saw changes to the [[Philippine energy law]],{{clarify|reason=what changes? Not clear in article or in law article|date=March 2014}} and the popularity of the [[EDSA People Power Revolution]].

=== Declaration of martial law ===
President Ferdinand E. Marcos declared [[martial law]] in the midst of rising student movements and an increasing number communist and socialist groups lobbying for reforms in their respective sectors. Leftists held rallies to express their frustrations to the government, this restiveness culminating in the [[First Quarter Storm]], where activists stormed [[Malacañang Palace]] only to be turned back by the [[Philippine Constabulary]].{{When|date=July 2012}} This event in particular left four people dead and many injured after heavy exchanges of gunfire. There was further unrest, and in the middle of the disorder on 21 September 1972, Marcos issued [[Proclamation No. 1081]], effectively installing martial law in the Philippines, a declaration that suspended civil rights and imposed military rule in the country.

Marcos defended his actions stressing the need for extra powers to quell the rising wave of violence allegedly caused by the communists. He further justified the decree citing the provisions from the [[Philippine Constitution]] that martial law is in fact a strategic approach to legally defend the Constitution and protect the welfare of the Filipino people from the dangerous threats posed by vigilantes that place [[national security]] at risk.  The emergency rule, according to Marcos's plan, was to lead the country into what he calls a “New Society”.

The move was initially supported by most Filipinos and viewed by some critics as a change that would solve the massive [[corruption]] in the country. Indeed, it{{Clarify|date=July 2012}} ended the clash between the executive and legislative branches of the government and a bureaucracy characterized by special interests. The declaration, however, eventually proved unpopular as excesses, continued corruption, and [[human rights abuses]] by the military emerged.

=== Macroeconomic indicators ===

==== Gross domestic product ====
[[File:GrowthRatesGDPpercapita.jpg|left|frame|100x100px|1970-1980 Growth Rates of GDP per capita (in%)]] The GDP of the Philippines rose during the [[martial law]], rising from P55 million to P19.3 billion in about 8 years. This growth was spurred by massive lending from commercial banks, accounting for about 62% percent of external debt.&lt;ref name="multiple1"&gt;{{cite book|last=De Dios|first=Emmanuel|title=An analysis of the Philippine economic crisis|year=1984|publisher=University of the Philippines Press|location=Diliman, Q.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a developing country, the Philippines during the martial law was one of the heaviest borrowers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} These aggressive moves were seen by critics as a means of legitimizing martial law by purportedly enhancing the chances of the country in the global market.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  Much of the money was spent on pump-priming to improve infrastructure and promote [[tourism]]. However, despite the aggressive borrowing and spending policies, the [[Philippines]] lagged behind its Southeast Asia counterparts in GDP growth rate per capita. The country, in 1970–1980, only registered an average 3.4 percent growth, while its counterparts like [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Indonesia]] garnered a mean growth of 5.4 percent.&lt;ref name="multiple1"/&gt; This lag, which became very apparent at the end of the Marcos Regime, can be attributed to the failures of economic management that was brought upon by State-run monopolies, mismanaged exchange rates, imprudent monetary policy and debt management, all underpinned by rampant corruption and cronyism. “[…]main characteristics distinguishing the Marcos years from other periods of our history has been the trend towards the concentration of power in the hands of the government, and the use of governmental functions to dispense economic privileges to some small factions in the private sector.”&lt;ref name="multiple1" /&gt;

==== Employment ====
Government efforts to pump-prime the economy to increase income and encourage spending, [[unemployment]] and [[underemployment]] grew. The [[unemployment rate]] decreased from 5.2 to 0.9 percent from 1978–1983, while employment was a problem, the latter tripling, in the same time period, from 10.2 to 29.0 percent.  Concurrently, the labor force of the Philippines grew at an average 10.47 percent in 1970-1983.&lt;ref name="multiple1"/&gt; This can be attributed to an increasing number of women seeking work in the market.

==== Poverty and income distribution ====
[[Distribution of wealth|Income equality]] grew during the era of martial law as the richest 60% of the nation were able to contribute only 92.5% of the income in 1980, up from 25.0% in 1970. The richest 80%, meanwhile, took a larger share of the income at 91.7% in 1980, up from 57.1% in 1970.&lt;ref name="multiple1"/&gt; These trends coincided with accusations of [[cronyism]] in the Marcos administration, as the administration faced allegations of favoring certain companies that were close to the ruling family.

According to the FIES (Family Income and Expenditure Survey) conducted from 1965 to 1985, [[poverty]] incidence in the Philippines rose from 11% in 1965 to 18.9% in 1985. This can be attributed to lower real agricultural wages and higher real wages for unskilled and skilled laborers. Real agricultural wages rose about 25% from their 1962 level, while real wages for unskilled and skilled laborers increased by about one-third of their 1962 level.

=== Main development strategies ===
In the two decades of Marcos's rule, Philippine [[economic development]] strategy had three central pillars: the [[Green Revolution]], Export Agriculture and forestry, and foreign borrowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jesuits. Philippine Province|author2=Ateneo de Manila University|title=Philippine studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HJVuAAAAMAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The green revolution ====
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
[[Rice]], the foundation of the Philippine economy, is the [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136562 country’s single most important crop], and the [[staple food]] for much of the population.  It is especially important to the country's poor majority, as both consumers and producers.

In 1973, the martial law regime [http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1975/07/29/presidential-decree-no-755-s-1975/ merged all coconut-related], government operations within a single agency, the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA). The PCA was empowered to collect a levy of P0.55 per 100 kilograms on the sale of copra to be used to stabilize the domestic price of coconut-based consumer goods, particularly cooking oil. In 1974, the government created the Coconut Industry Development Fund (CIDF) to finance the development of a hybrid coconut tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarete|first=R.L.|date=|title=An Analysis of the Economic Policies Affecting the Philippine Coconut Industry|url=http://dirp4.pids.gov.ph/ris/wp/pidswp8308.pdf|journal=Philippine Institute of Development Studies (PIDS)|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To finance the project, the levy was increased to P20.[5]

Also in 1974, coconut planters, led by the Coconut Producers Federation (Cocofed), an organization of large planters, took control of the PCA governing board. In 1975 the PCA acquired a bank, renamed the United Coconut Planters Bank, to service the needs of coconut farmers, and the PCA director, Eduardo Cojuangco, a business associate of Marcos, became its president. Levies collected by the PCA were placed in the bank, initially interest-free.[5]

The architects of this technology had one overriding objective: increased food production. Proponents of the strategy expected, however, that the new rice technology would also have a positive distributional impact on the poor.  Three major benefits were taken to be virtually self-evident:

:1.	Increased rice output would, ceteris paribus, lower the price of rice.
::Since the poor spend a larger fraction of their income on food than the rich do, the idea is that they would benefit excessively.
:2.	Poor farmers would share in the gains to rice producers.
::The new technology was labor intensive. This would be a special advantage to smaller growers who have lower labor costs.
:3.	Landless agricultural workers would benefit too.
::Thanks to the increased demand for labor and the resulting increased employment and higher wages.

===== New rice technology: Three essential elements =====
The following key factors of the new rice technology were interdependent. That is, if one was absent, the productivity of the others was greatly reduced.

::1. ‘High-yielding’ or ‘modern’ rice varieties originated at the IRRI
::2. Chemical fertilizers, to which these varieties are highly responsive
::3. [[Water control]], notably [[irrigation]] in the Philippine setting

Among these, water control remains a key constraint in Philippine rice agriculture. Improvements in often “can be most efficiently achieved by the mobilization of community labor”,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} but this poses problems with respect to public welfare. How will labor commitments and other costs be apportioned? How will irrigation water be fairly allocated? In some places, these problems have been resolved; but elsewhere{{Where|date=July 2012}}, conflict and mistrust among individuals have “impeded collective action”.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The green revolution brought temporary relief from this impasse, allowing the country to achieve substantial rice yield increases via the shift to new seed-fertilizer technology. But constraints in irrigation did not permit the new varieties to attain their full potential yields, nor did it permit much increase in multiple cropping.

===== Green revolution: Overall effect =====
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
In the early 1990s, the average coconut farm was a medium-sized unit of less than four hectares. Owners, often absentee, customarily employed local peasants to collect coconuts rather than engage in tenancy relationships. The villagers were paid on a piece-rate basis. Those employed in the coconut industry tended to be less educated and older than the average person in the rural labor force and earned lower-than-average incomes.[5]
In addition, economic theory tells us that consumers in general, and poor consumers in particular, will benefit from increased output and the resulting price declines. Despite the positive impact of lower prices on poor consumers, [[absolute poverty]] increased. “Cheaper rice mitigated, but did not reverse the trend towards impoverishment.”{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==== Export agriculture and forestry ====
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
The year 1962 was a good one for Philippine export agriculture. Devaluation  and deregulation of foreign exchange brought windfall profits to agro-exporters, and were widely seen as a “political triumph” for its main traditional exports.

In 1978 the United Coconut Planters Bank was given legal authority to purchase coconut mills, ostensibly as a measure to cope with excess capacity in the industry. At the same time, mills not owned by coconut farmers—that is, Cocofed members or entities it controlled through the PCA—were denied subsidy payments to compensate for the price controls on coconut-based consumer products. By early 1980, it was reported in the Philippine press that the United Coconut Oil Mills, a PCA-owned firm, and its president, Cojuangco, controlled 80 percent of the Philippine oil-milling capacity.[5] Minister of Defense Juan Ponce Enrile also exercised strong influence over the industry as chairman of both the United Coconut Planters Bank and United Coconut Oil Mills and honorary chairman of Cocofed. An industry composed of some 0.5 million farmers and 14,000 traders was, by the early 1980s, highly monopolized.[5]

In principle, the coconut farmers were to be the beneficiaries of the levy, which between March 1977 and September 1981 stabilized at P76 per 100 kilograms. Contingent benefits included life insurance, educational scholarships, and a cooking oil subsidy, but few actually benefited. The aim of the replanting program, controlled by Cojuangco, was to replace aging coconut trees with a hybrid of a Malaysian dwarf and West African tall varieties. The new palms were to produce five times the weight per year of existing trees. The target of replanting 60,000 trees a year was not met.[5] In 1983, 25 to 30 percent of coconut trees were estimated to be at least 60 years old; by 1988, the proportion had increased to between 35 and 40 percent.[5]

When coconut prices began to fall in the early 1980s, pressure mounted to alter the structure of the industry. In 1985, the Philippine government agreed to dismantle the United Coconut Oil Mills as part of an agreement with the IMF to bail out the Philippine economy. Later in 1988, United States law requiring foods using tropical oils to be labeled indicating the saturated fat content had a negative impact on an already ailing industry and gave rise to protests from coconut growers that similar requirements were not levied on oils produced in temperate climates.[5]
Philippine earnings, nevertheless, did not rise equally owing to worsening terms of trade. The country experienced severely declining terms of trade and great price instability for its agricultural exports from 1962 to 1985. These price movements were “the result of external political and economic forces over which the Philippines could exercise little control.”{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Thus relying on export agriculture as an “engine of economic growth” proved unfeasible.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===== Export agriculture and forestry: Overall effect =====
The effects of this special treatment of favorites soon became apparent. Their products were of poor quality and were poor value of money.
The traditional economic mainstay of the Philippine ruling elite has been export agriculture. Development strategy in the Marcos era continued to rely on this sector as a major source of income and foreign exchange, between 1962 and 1985, export crop acreage more than doubled. Earnings did not rise commensurately, however, owing to worsening terms of trade.

==== Foreign borrowing: The debt-for-development strategy ====
Foreign borrowing was a key element in Philippine development strategy during the Marcos era. The primary rationale was “borrowed money would speed the growth of the Philippine economy, improving the well-being of present and future generations of Filipinos”.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===== Debt-driven growth, 1970-1983 =====
[[File:InternationalReservesvsForeignDebt.jpg|right|230x230px|frame|Table 1]] The Marcos regime cornered an increasing share of the profits from the traditional export crops, sugar cane and coconut. The result was a redistribution of income from agro-export elite as a whole to a politically well-connected subset of that elite.
In declaring martial law, Marcos promised to save the country from “an oligarchy that appropriated for itself all power and bounty.” But while he did indeed tame selected oligarchs most threatening to his regime, was a “new oligarchy” of Marcos and his relatives and cronies which achieved dominance within many economic sectors. While foreign loans sustained decrease in the 1970s, crony abuses brought economic disaster in the early 1980s (de Dios, 1984). Most fundamentally, martial law perpetuated important shortcomings of the Philippine capitalism, because Marcos was merely expanding earlier patterns of patrimonial plunder. Particularistic demands continued to prevail, the difference being that one ruler now appropriated a much larger proportion of the state apparatus toward the service of his own private end. As the economic crisis intensified – especially after the 1983 assassination of opposition leader Benigno S. Aquino – the IMF transformed itself from “doting parent” to" vengeful god" and forced a wrenching process of economic stabilization that induced severe recession. This heightened the regime's unpopularity, assisted the continuing growth of both leftist and moderate resistance throughout the archipelago, and paved away for the Marcos regime's demise amid the “people power” uprising of February 1986. More thoroughgoing attempts at reform awaited the advent of a new democratic era.
Marcos increased the stature of technocrats within the government and, through their public rhetoric in favor of policy reform, help to ensure the continued flow of loans into the country. Over time, however, became increasingly clear that technocracy would have to give way to an acquisitive and more influential diversified family conglomerates. Marcos and his cronies used access to the political machinery to accumulate wealth, and – like the major families of the pre-martial law years - had little loyalty to the nation. The cronyism of the Marcos regime was more obvious than the cronyism of either the pre-1972 period or the post-1986 years, since the regime had more centralized control over the state apparatus and enjoyed much longer tenure in office.
While special interest groups continued to prevail, the difference was that a dictator now had a much firmer grip on the state apparatus to service his own private end.
Oligarchic plunder was manifest in the crony capitalists that controlled the industries during the dictatorial regime. Crony capitalists “were businessmen who walk the corridors of the presidency and by virtue of this proximity to Marcos drove policy making and by doing so were able to control specific sectors of the economy.”

===== Battle for stabilization, 1983-1986 =====
The mixed but generally positive results of the stabilization period were
accompanied by rising domestic political tensions and violence. The 1969
election, in which Marcos had been returned for a second term, was a low
point in the Philippine electoral process. Marcos had spent far more than any
previous incumbent in seeking re-election against an opponent who was
generally given little chance of success. The campaign and election were
also more violent than previous elections; by one estimate, two hundred
people were killed during the campaign (Shaplen 1979, 21 1). The election
greatly heightened political animosities and spawned violent protests by
student groups in 1970 and 1971, directed against Marcos but also against
the Philippine Congress, which was widely dismissed as corrupt, inefficient,
and obstructionist. Public cynicism toward the government was increased by
the constitutional convention that Marcos called in 1971, which was a thinly
disguised attempt to extend his hold on power beyond the eight-year
maximum in the existing constitution. This period also saw the reorganiza- 
385 PhilippinesKhapter 1
tion and heightened activity of the Communist Party of the Philippines
(CPP).

===== External debt: magnitude and composition =====
Between 1962 and 1986, the external debt of the Philippine grew from $355 million to $28.3 billion. By the end of the Marcos years, the Philippines was the “ninth most indebted nation in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and Latin America in absolute terms”.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

=== Other development policies ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
The Marcos regime, during the early to mid-'70s, focused primarily on improving the economy and the country's public image through major increases in government spending particularly on infrastructures. Its main beneficiaries were the tourism industry, with numerous constructions, such as the [[Philippine International Convention Center]], hotels, and even the hosting of international events like the [[Miss Universe]] and [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] forums to be able to improve the international status of the county. This policy generally continued even through the 1980s, when the world was experiencing stagflation, an international debt crisis, and high increases of interest rates.

The early effects of the increase in government spending were generally positive. Private businesses and firms, seeing this action by the government, felt bullish and also engaged in aggressive investment and spending patterns. Initially, the gross domestic capital formation{{Clarify|date=July 2012}} to GDP rose up to 28% and foreign investments to the country also increased.

The government, in the 1970s, also focused on an “Export-led Industrialization Program” which focused on “non-traditional manufactured exports and foreign investments.” This led to an increase of foreign direct investment in the country particularly to manufacture export-oriented goods. This program also allowed the government to be able to “shift the composition of exports toward a more balanced mix between non-traditional manufactures and primary/agricultural exports.”{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

With this growth in the export sector, there also accompanied growth in the import sector particularly since imported raw materials (also known as intermediate imports) were sourced for domestically produced goods. This led to the worsening deficit at that time, especially by the end of the decade, accompanied by the second oil price shock.

=== Assessment of the Marcos regime ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
The evening of the attack, citing a conspiracy of leftist and rightist groups and the Muslim secessionist movement, Marcos declared martial law. That night, hundreds of persons were arrested by the military, including opposition politicians and journalists. Radio and television stations were closed, and the country's newspapers shut down. The Congress was dissolved, and under martial law powers, Marcos began to rule by presidential decree. The constitutional convention that was formed in 1971 continued, minus some dozen opposition leaders who had been detained, and in 1973 it produced a draft constitution providing for a transition to a parliamentary form of government. The length of the transition period was left to Marcos’ discretion, and the draft constitution also gave Marcos the ability to dismiss any member of the judiciary. The new constitution was ratified in a hastily organized referendum and upheld by the Supreme Court.

==Post-EDSA macroeconomics==
The '''Post-EDSA macroeconomic history of the Philippines''' covers the period from 1986 to the present time, and takes off from the acclaimed [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[EDSA Revolution of 1986]] (named after Epifanio de los Santos Avenue in Manila) that brought democracy and development potentials back to the country that was once in the perils of the Martial Law Era. From days, months, and even years of economic and financial collapse towards the end of that Martial Law Era came revolution, reform, and sustenance spearheaded by the Aquino, Ramos, Estrada, and Arroyo administrations that saw the Philippines get back on track and even through some of the wildest financial and political crises, such as the succeeding EDSA Revolutions, the [[Asian Financial Crisis]], and the most recent “bubble bursts,” among others. Revolutions, liberal ideas, and reforms aided the country towards robust growth, and crucial policies were conceptualized, developed, and enacted by the presidents and the advisers who supported them. The period also featured the emergence of civil society as important proponents of development, trade reforms and protections, improvements in exports and export-oriented manufacturing, and decentralization as an important take-off point for regional development.

===Economic breakthroughs by administration===

====Aquino administration====
The Aquino administration takes over an economy that has gone through socio-political disasters during the People Power revolution, where there was financial and commodity collapse caused by an overall consumer cynicism, a result of the propaganda against cronies, social economic unrest resulting from numerous global shortages, massive protests, lack of government transparency, the opposition's speculations and alleged corruption in the government. At that point in time, the country had debt that began crippling the country which slowly made the Philippines the “Latin-American in East Asia” as it started to experience the worst [[recession]] since the post-war era.

Most of the immediate efforts of the Aquino administration was directed in reforming the image of the country and paying off all debts, including those that some governments were ready to write-off, as possible. This resulted in budget cuts and further aggravated the plight of the lower class because the jobs offered to them by the government was now gone. Infrastructure projects, including repairs, were halted in secluded provinces turning concrete roads into asphalt. Privatization of many government corporations, most catering utilities, was the priority of the Aquino administration which led to massive lay-offs and inflation. The Aquino administration however, was persistent in its belief that the problems were caused by the previous administration.

Growth gradually began in the next few years of the administration. Somehow, there was still a short-lived, patchy, and erratic recovery from 1987 to 1991 as the political situation stabilized a bit. With this, the peso became more competitive, confidence of investors was gradually regained, positive movements in terms of trade were realized, and regional growth gradually strengthened.

There were other key events in the administration that affected the economy. Perhaps the first most important, aside from the ratification of the [[1987 Constitution]], would be the administration's pushing for a more open political framework where the administration somehow gave in to the interests of new economic actors. This approach, which also proved important in regaining the confidence of investors, whether domestic or foreign, was definitely unthinkable during the Marcos era. The administration was also characterized by the rescheduling and management of international debts, an exhibition perhaps of the fact that other external entities also sympathized with what happened to the Philippines and also allowed the Philippines to get back on track before anything else.

Development in this administration, however, was slightly bothered by some unforeseen circumstances such as organized coups by the Reformed Armed Forces Movement in 1991. Negotiations with Mindanao also stalled development along with the coup attempts. The Philippines was also hit by the oil price hike effects of the [[Gulf War]]. Pressure on government spending and safety nets was intensified as natural calamities like earthquakes and the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo plagued the country, just as if the daily brownouts were not bad enough.

One of the most important policies of the administration is the launching of the [[Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program]] in June 1988, which involved the acquisition and redistribution of all agricultural lands within a time frame of 10 years. So far, the law has already had numerous accomplishments since it was actually passed. There were setbacks, however, in the overall implementation of this reform program such as the Garchitorena scandal (1989) tainting the [[Department of Agrarian Reform]] (DAR) and supposedly exposing inefficiencies in the government bureaucracy. Another important breakthrough involved in the program was the fact that the program was also seen as a way to address poverty and equity issues.

Also important in the administration were the trade reforms. The trade reforms pushed by the administration were those that improved export growth and foreign trade through the abolishing of export taxes, the gradual liberalization of imports, and the imposition of an anti-export bias ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Balisacan and Hill, “The Philippine Economy” 141&lt;/ref&gt; The reforms also involved the reduction in trade barriers, more specifically by removing restrictions on imports and reforming the import-licensing system. Tariff rates were also eventually reduced to encourage more foreign trade.&lt;ref&gt;Balisacan and Hill, “The Dynamics” 374&lt;/ref&gt; The administration was also a big part in the realization of the [[ASEAN Free Trade Area]] which also served as encouragement for foreign trade.

Some other policies in the administration included fiscal contraction in order to control and manage inflation (Balisacan and Hill, “The Philippine Economy” 110). The administration was also able to reorganize the [[National Economic and Development Authority]], or NEDA, to its present form last July 22, 1987 and the Philippine Exporters’ Confederation (PHILEXPORT) in October 1991. The administration was also instrumental in introducing a new framework for infrastructure development which said that “the government should provide the enabling policy environment for greater private sector participation in infrastructure provision” (Balisacan and Hill, “The Dynamics” 330). As for industry dispersal and regional growth, the administration conceptualized and enforced the Local Government Code of 1991 which increased the autonomy and development of Local Government Units through decentralization.

====Ramos administration====
The Ramos administration basically served its role as the carrier of the momentum of reform and as an important vehicle in “hastening the pace of liberalization and openness in the country”.&lt;ref&gt;Balisacan and Hill, “The Philippine Economy” 106&lt;/ref&gt; The administration was a proponent of [[capital account]] liberalization, which made the country more open to foreign trade, investments, and relations. It was during this administration when the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] was established, and this administration was also when the Philippines joined the [[World Trade Organization]] and other free trade associations such as the [[APEC]]. During the administration, debt reduction was also put into consideration and as such, the issuance of certain government bonds called [[Brady Bonds]] also came to fruition in 1992. Key negotiations with conflicting forces in Mindanao actually became more successful during the administration, which also highlighted the great role and contributions of Jose Almonte as the key adviser of this liberal administration.

By the time Ramos succeeded Corazon Aquino in 1992, the Philippine economy was already burdened with a heavy budget deficit. This was largely the result of austerity measures imposed by a standard credit arrangement with the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the destruction caused by natural disasters such as the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Hence, according to Canlas, pump priming through government spending was immediately ruled out due to the deficit. Ramos therefore resorted to institutional changes through structural policy reforms, of which included privatization and deregulation. He sanctioned the formation of the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council (LEDAC), which served as a forum for consensus building, on the part of the Executive and the Legislative branches, on important bills on economic policy reform measures (4).

The daily brownouts that plagued the economy were also addressed through the enactment of policies that placed guaranteed rates. The economy during the first year of Ramos administration suffered from severe power shortage, with frequent brownouts, each lasting from 8 to 12 hours. To resolve this problem, the Electric Power Crisis Act was made into law together with the Build-Operate-Transfer Law. Twenty power plants were built because of these, and in effect, the administration was able to eliminate the power shortage problems in December 1993 and sustained economic growth for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Canlas 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The economy seemed to be all set for long-run growth, as shown by sustainable and promising growth rates from 1994 to 1997. However, the Asian Crisis contagion which started from Thailand and Korea started affecting the Philippines. This prompted the Philippine economy to plunge into continuous devaluation and very risky ventures, resulting in property busts and a negative growth rate. The remarkable feat of the administration, however, was that it was able to withstand the contagion effect of the Asian Crisis better than anybody else in the neighboring countries. Most important in the administration was that it made clear the important tenets of reform, which included economic liberalization, stronger institutional foundations for development, redistribution, and political reform.&lt;ref&gt;Balisacan and Hill, “The Philippine Economy” 57-59&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps some of the most important policies and breakthroughs of the administration are the Capital Account Liberalization and the subsequent commitments to free trade associations such as APEC, AFTA, GATT, and WTO. The liberalization and opening of the capital opening culminated in full-peso convertibility in 1992.&lt;ref name="Balisacanand"&gt;Balisacan and Hill, “The Philippine Economy” 21&lt;/ref&gt; And then another breakthrough is again, the establishment of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, which also involved the reduction of debts in that the debts of the old central bank were taken off its books.

In line with the administration's “Philippines 2000” platform, the administration gave more favor to privatization and targeted the proliferation of cartels and monopolies, especially in some key industries such as telecommunications. To further raise revenues, President Ramos also administered the privatization of Petron, Philippine National Bank (PNB), Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewage System (MWSS) and military-based lands such as Fort Bonifacio and Clark Air Base. As part of the administration's competition policy, the administration also advocated for deregulation of service industries to promote foreign investment and increase private sector participation.&lt;ref&gt;Balisacan and Hill, “The Philippine Economy” 157&lt;/ref&gt; For monetary policy, the administration focused on “inflating targeting and the imposition of a floating exchange rate with a managed band”.&lt;ref name="Balisacanand" /&gt; With this, inflation stayed under control in the 1990s and indeed, the 1990s became an era of reform and at the same time, a period of optimism.

For fiscal policy, on the other hand, the administration worked on bills to expand the scope of VAT.&lt;ref&gt;Balisacan and Hill, “The Dynamics” 194&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the need to reduce budget deficit, tax-enhancement measures were imposed. Among these were the “upward adjustment in the excise tax on cigarettes, withholding VAT or value-added tax on government contractors and suppliers, and establishment of a large taxpayers’ unit in the Bureau of Internal Revenue" which increased tax revenue of government. There was even a budget surplus in the years 1994 to 1996 due to the effective tax-enhancement program by the administration.&lt;ref&gt;Canlas 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ramos administration basically continued the actions of the Aquino administration for infrastructures and industry dispersal. This administration, however, would also have some contributions to welfare. The administration's population policy promoted population management and family planning, while the administration's Social Reform Agenda (SRA) addressed poverty through flagship programs.&lt;ref&gt;Balisacan and Hill, “The Philippine Economy” 315&lt;/ref&gt; Completion of the CARP, or Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program, was one such breakthrough incorporated in the SRA. By June 1998, it was reported by the government that it had only managed to accomplish 57%, a figure still far from the planned total ten year target from the original timetable for land distribution (Ochoa 167).

Furthermore, Ramos was wholly focused on institutional reform in an attempt to capture the international community's perception of an improving a Philippine economy, with the agenda of increasing global competitiveness. The rural sector's interest was not much represented. Farmers had insufficient funding for rural infrastructure and support services while real estate developers agreed on better deals.  To quote Ochoa, “the liberalization of agriculture ensured their dependence on so-called safety nets that could not significantly resuscitate the sector. Six years of ‘dipping productivity, declining incomes, dwindling farmlands and pervasive poverty’ will be hard to forget" (165).

In the end, the Philippine economy under the Ramos administration gained recognition in breaking out of its deficit-laden stature in Asia. “The confidence generated by the administration among local and international players and analysts resulted from wide‐ranging reforms rooted primarily in a sound macroeconomic and investor‐friendly regime as well as global competitiveness”.&lt;ref&gt;Bernardo and Tang v&lt;/ref&gt; From 1993, one year's time after Ramos assumed presidency, the economy already started to recover from stagnation with real GDP growth peaking at 5.8% in 1996. Aside from this, it was also during his administration that allowed for the escape of the Philippine economy from recession, during the Asian Financial Crisis, unlike its Asian neighbors like Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia. His reforms have brought gains, broad spillover effects on the rest of the economy and possible positive long-term effects on economic growth. Surely, it is of no doubt that Ramos is commendable to have established strong political leadership that was mandatory in handling the reforms, prior to the weak state of the economy he inherited.

====Estrada administration====

Although Estrada's administration had to endure the continued shocks of the Asian Crisis contagion, the administration was also characterized by the administration's economic mismanagement and “midnight cabinets.” As if the pro-poor rhetoric, promises and drama were not really appalling enough, the administration also had “midnight cabinets composed of ‘drinking buddies’ influencing the decisions of the ‘daytime cabinet’”&lt;ref&gt;Balisacan and Hill, “The Philippine Economy” 19&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Cronyism]] and other big issues caused the country’s image of economic stability to change towards the worse. And instead of adjustments happening, people saw further deterioration and hopelessness that better things can happen. Targeted revenues were not reached, implementation of policies became very slow, and fiscal adjustments were not efficiently conceptualized and implemented. All those disasters caused by numerous mistakes were made worse by the sudden entrance of the ''[[Jueteng]]'' controversy, which gave rise to the succeeding EDSA Revolutions.

Despite all these controversies, the administration still had some meaningful and profound policies to applaud. The administration presents a reprise of the population policy, which involved the assisting of married couples to achieve their fertility goals, reduce unwanted fertility and match their unmet need for contraception. The administration also pushed for budget appropriations for family planning and contraceptives, an effort that was eventually stopped due to the fact that the church condemned it.&lt;ref&gt;Balisacan and Hill, “The Philippine Economy” 299&lt;/ref&gt; The administration was also able to implement a piece of its overall Poverty Alleviation Plan, which involved the delivery of social services, basic needs, and assistance to the poor families. The Estrada administration also had limited contributions to Agrarian Reform, perhaps spurred by the acknowledgement that indeed, Agrarian Reform can also address poverty and inequitable control over resources. In that regard, the administration establishes the program “Sustainable Agrarian Reform Communities-Technical Support to Agrarian and Rural Development”.&lt;ref&gt;Villegas 646-647&lt;/ref&gt; As for regional development, however, the administration had no notable contributions or breakthroughs.

====Macapagal-Arroyo administration====

The Arroyo administration, economically speaking, was a period of good growth rates simultaneous with the US, due perhaps to the emergence of the [[Overseas Filipino]] workers (OFW) and the [[Business Process Outsourcing]] (BPO). The emergence of the OFW and the BPO improved the contributions of OFW remittances and investments to growth. In 2004, however, fiscal deficits grew and grew as tax collections fell, perhaps due to rampant and wide scale [[tax avoidance and tax evasion]] incidences. Fearing that a doomsday prophecy featuring the [Argentina default] in 2002 might come to fruition, perhaps due to the same sort of fiscal crisis, the administration pushed for the enactment of the 12% VAT and the E-VAT to increase tax revenue and address the large fiscal deficits. This boosted fiscal policy confidence and brought the economy back on track once again.

Soon afterwards, political instability afflicted the country and the economy anew with [[Abu Sayyaf]] terrors intensifying. The administration's Legitimacy Crisis also became a hot issue and threat to the authority of the Arroyo administration. Moreover, the Arroyo administration went through many raps and charges because of some controversial deals such as the NBN-ZTE Broadband Deal. Due however to the support of local leaders and the majority of the House of Representatives, political stability was restored and threats to the administration were quelled and subdued. Towards the end of the administration, high inflation rates for rice and oil in 2008 started to plague the country anew, and this led to another fiscal crisis, which actually came along with the major recession that the United States and the rest of the world were actually experiencing.

The important policies of the Arroyo administration highlighted the importance of regional development, tourism, and foreign investments into the country. Therefore, apart from the enactment and establishment of the E-VAT policy to address the worsening fiscal deficits, the administration also pushed for regional development studies in order to address certain regional issues such as disparities in regional per capita income and the effects of commercial communities on rural growth.&lt;ref&gt;Balisacan and Hill, “The Dynamics” 378&lt;/ref&gt; The administration also advocated for investments to improve tourism, especially in other unexplored regions that actually need development touches as well. To further improve tourism, the administration launched the policy touching on Holiday Economics, which involves the changing of days in which we would celebrate certain holidays. Indeed, through the Holiday Economics approach, investments and tourism really improved. As for investment, the Arroyo administration would normally go through lots of trips to other countries in order to encourage foreign investments for the betterment of the Philippine economy and its development.

====Benigno Aquino III administration====

The Philippines consistently coined as one of the Newly Industrialized Countries has had a fair gain during the latter years under the Arroyo Presidency to the current administration. The government managed foreign debts falling from 58% in 2008 to 47% of total government borrowings. According to the 2012 World Wealth Report, the Philippines was the fastest growing economy in the world in 2010 with a GDP growth of 7.3% driven by the growing business process outsourcing and overseas remittances.&lt;ref name=PHGrowth&gt;{{cite news |title=Philippines, 6th fastest growing in the world: wealth report|url=http://www.rappler.com/business/10928-ph-to-post-high-growth-until-2050 |work=Rappler |date=Aug 21, 2012 |accessdate=Aug 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country marked slipped to 3.6% in 2011 less emphasis on exports and the government spent less on infrastructure. Also the disruption of the flow of imports for raw material from floods in Thailand and the tsunami in Japan have affected the manufacturing sector in the same year. "The Philippines contributed more than $125 million as of end-2011 to the pool of money disbursed by the International Monetary Fund to help address the financial crisis confronting economies in Europe.This was according to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, which reported Tuesday that the Philippines, which enjoys growing foreign exchange reserves, has made available about $251.5 million to the IMF to finance the assistance program—the Financial Transactions Plan (FTP)—for crisis-stricken countries."&lt;ref name=PHLeander&gt;{{cite news |title=Philippines contributed $125M to IMF as of end-’11 |url=http://business.inquirer.net/45725/philippines-contributed-125m-to-imf-as-of-end-%E2%80%9911|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=Feb 22, 2012 |accessdate=Feb 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Remarkably the economy grew by 6.59% in 2012 the same year the Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Renato Corona]] was impeached for a failed disclosure of statements of assets, liabilities and network or SALN coherent to the anti-corruption campaign of the administration.&lt;ref name=CJConviction&gt;{{cite news |title=Senate votes 20–3 to convict Corona |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/202929/senate-convicts-corona |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=May 29, 2012 |accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippine Stock Exchange index ended in the year with 5,812.73 points a 32.95% growth from the 4,371.96-finish in 2011.&lt;ref name=PSEi&gt;{{cite news |title=PSEi ends 2012 in the green, up 33% from last year |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/12/28/12/psei-ends-2012-green-33-last-year |work=ABS-CBN News |date=Dec 28, 2012 |accessdate=Dec 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBB- investment grade by Fitch Ratings on the first quarter of 2013 for the country was made because of a resilient economy by remittances, growth despite the global economic crisis in the last five years reforms by the VAT reform law of 2005, BSP inflation management, good governance reforms under the Aquino administration.&lt;ref name=Invest&gt;{{cite news |title=A first: Investment grade rating for PH |url=http://www.rappler.com/business/economy-watch/24936-a-first-investment-grade-rating-for-ph|work=PRappler|date=March 27, 2013 |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special issues and prospects==
{{Original research section|date=September 2018}}

===The harmony of the deep determinants=== 
One of the biggest issues of development is the management of the so-called “deep determinants” of economic growth and development. Thus, an issue for the economy today is to keep these determinants and factors in check. The determinants that countries have to keep in check would include physical infrastructure, demographics, population, geography, political and social stability, and investment atmosphere, among others. Now a question to raise here is how is the Philippines actually doing when it comes to these determinants?

The Philippines is falling behind neighbors when it comes to physical infrastructure. This period of global development is such a crucial period, and countries definitely cannot afford to “underinvest” in infrastructure development. Population, on the other hand, definitely has to be checked out. As of this moment in time, it seems as if the population is starting to become a slight puzzle to development and thus, issues directed towards population, such as the [[RH Bill]] issue, need to be resolved quickly. Moreover, aside from labor, the economy and institutions really have to start looking for more productive uses of population, or maybe ways in which population growth can be made to synch with economic growth. Population growth is also higher in the Philippines than in any of the neighboring countries so maximization of such a development can be of great help.

Meanwhile, when it comes to the environment and natural resources, the Philippines continues to be plagued by the degradation and loss of precious natural resources. Typhoons like the ferocious tandem of Ondoy and Pepeng in 2009, as well as earthquakes, also continue to plague the country's resources. So aside from some explicit policies for environmental development and preservation such as the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] and policies that regulate the waste materials of factories, the economy and the institutions should continue to address the problems faced by natural resources.

Political and social stability are also important in maintaining sustainable development. Elections and competent leadership have to be kept organized and consistent with the kind of political organization that serves as a good premise for development. Legal and judicial processes have to undergo reform and the systems must become quicker this time. Consistency of policies is also an important thing to observe in the future because it seems that in the past administrations, many inconsistencies, most especially when it comes to economic policies, actually come into the picture as regimes change. Conflicts with Mindanao also have to be resolved once and for all.

One more major concern plaguing the country is the investment atmosphere prevalent in the country. Aside from the already mentioned underinvestment in infrastructure, some more investment issues that need to be addressed include the attention that must be given to corporate governance and the stock market and the protections that have to be developed for investments and property rights. The investment environment is still shaky, perhaps also because of the quality of government in the Philippines. Perhaps it is clear that the country and the institutions need to push for improved quality of governance for the betterment of the investment atmosphere in the country.

===Poverty alleviation and economics with heart===

Generally, during the period in question, roughly a third of the population of the Philippines was below what is called the Threshold Family Income(TFI). Even until now, this continues to be true. Villegas presented that in 1991, poverty incidence hit 39.9%, and 4,780,865 families actually fell below the TFI value. Things became a bit better in 1994, with poverty incidence dropping to 35.5%. Gradually, poverty incidence dropped to around 26% in 2001 (586-588). This, however, still isn’t something to applaud about. Until now, the distribution of wealth in the country is still inequitable, and the lowering of poverty incidence does not mean that it is really low enough to serve as a premise for development. And even though poverty incidence keeps on getting lower and lower, other crucial welfare factors, such as education, are still left unanswered. Malnutrition, low life expectancy, substandard housing, and child labor are still rampant even today, and there is this clear need for food and nutrition, health, education, housing, utility improvements, just so the poor families can have better grasps of subsistence.

Villegas enumerated some measures or ways to address poverty. Perhaps the first and most important of which is to “efficiently use the poor’s most abundant asset, which is labor” (597). Aside from these of course can come the provision of basic needs and the enactment of macroeconomic adjustments directed towards the development of the poor. Safety nets and other adjustment programs can also help.

Each administration during the period in question also responded to calls to eradicate poverty in their own ways. The Aquino administration touched on the generation of employment opportunities and the promotion of social justice. Moreover, the administration also pointed to the CARP as another institutionalized means to address poverty and social development through profit sharing, wealth redistribution, and labor administration. Meanwhile, the Ramos administration pushed forward the Social Reform Agenda which instituted flagship programs for the poor provinces in the country and prioritized the basic needs of people before attending to other economic demands.

Although Estrada's poverty alleviation platform dubbed “Erap Para sa Mahirap” seemed to be full of rhetoric and drama elements, there still seems to be this intent to actually address poverty and this acknowledgement that every administration has to at least heed the call. Estrada's poverty alleviation plan included the delivery of social development services, the removal of policy impediments to effective resource allocation, and the enactment of Lingap Para sa Mahirap where the 100 poorest families were identified and given packages of assistance. Arroyo would then follow this up with KALAHI (Kapit-Bisig Laban sa Kahirapan) and programs for asset reform, provision of human development services, creation of employment, and social protection, among others.

Though development and poverty alleviation cannot be acquired by an economy instantly, it would be honorable even just to try to show everyone that honest efforts are actually being exerted. The conceptualization, development, and enactment of policies are definitely not enough. Belief in the spirit of creative entrepreneurship and the devotion of policymakers to the people and stakeholders that they govern are at least equally, if not more important, for poverty alleviation to actually come to fruition.

===The informal economy===

The informal economy or the [[informal sector]], also referred to by the names “black market” and “underground market,” consists of entrepreneurs who engage in economic activities that fail to fulfill certain legal requirements even though their objectives are actually lawful. Perhaps the talipapa and sidewalk vendors can be good examples of this sector of the economy. Other examples could include the street children who sell sampaguita, or even people who engage in criminal acts affecting the economy, such as human trafficking, drug trafficking, and theft. The other more popular forms of informality can perhaps be the informal financial sector (loan sharks) and the proliferation of informal settlements, or squatters’ areas.&lt;ref&gt;Villegas 608-611&lt;/ref&gt; People normally dive into the informal sector due to poverty where they are somehow forced to produce or create income, or even due to the feeling that they are not being treated fairly by economic institutions. People who engage in informal activities somehow believe that informal economic activity is an expression of freedom from all the binding policies of the economy, and it is only then when they finally feel the true essence of being in a free market economy.

Informal economic activity accounts for between 25 and 40 percent of Gross National Income. Meaning, some &lt;!--500 billion WHAT? 500 billion rubber balls?: 500 billion worth of--&gt; informal income is not really accounted for in the aggregate production figures.&lt;ref&gt;Villegas 608&lt;/ref&gt; Informal economic activity really has to be addressed, and perhaps one of the best ways to do so is to study the roots of such activity and phenomenon, namely the loopholes of the legal system and mercantilist thought. In the legal system, there always seems to be injustice and in such a system, there would always be favored entities and forgotten entities. The current legal system also appears to be full of loopholes which give rise to many illegitimate opportunity structures, giving people some chance to actually get around the legal system. Thus, it would definitely be important to constitute reforms in the legal system to ensure fair play in the economy. If the atmosphere of fair play can be fostered and taken care of, then it is likely that informal players would go back to the formal economy.

==Economic crisis and response==
The [[Financial crisis (2007–present)|global economic crisis of 2008]] pulled countries around the globe into a [[recession]]. Following the [[Asian economic crisis]] in 1997, the 2008 crisis imposed new challenges to the [[Philippines]] as a developing country. The following are expositions of the macroeconomic impacts of the crisis on the Philippines, its implications in the prevalent [[poverty]] scenario, and policies and programs undertaken by the government in response to the crisis.

===Overview of the global economic crisis===

The 2008 global economic crisis started upon the bursting of the [[United States housing bubble]], which was followed by [[Bankruptcy|bankruptcies]], [[bailout]]s, [[foreclosure]]s, and takeovers of financial institutions by national governments. During a period of housing and credit booms, banks encouraged lending to home owners by a considerably high amount without appropriate level of transparency and financial supervision. As [[interest rate]]s rose in mid-2007, housing prices dropped extensively, and all institutions that borrowed and invested found themselves suffering significant losses. Financial institutions, insurance companies, and investment houses either declared bankruptcy or had to be rescued financially.  Economies worldwide slowed during this period and entered recession.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"&gt;Cuenca, Janet, Celia Reyes, Josef Yap, "Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on the Philippines", "(http://www.unicef.org/socialpolicy/files/Impact_of_the_Global_Finanical_and_Economic_Crisis_on_the_Philippines.pdf)", May 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis, initially financial in nature, took on a full-blown economic and global scale affecting every country, both industrialized and developing.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

===The Philippine situation before the crisis===
The Philippines has long had long-term structural problems that interfere with [[sustainable economic development]]. The country has been dominated by a sequence of growth spurts, brief and mediocre, followed by sharp to very-sharp, severe, and extended downturns—a cycle that came to be known as the [[Boom &amp; bust|boom-bust cycle]]. As such, economic growth record of the country has been disappointing in comparison with its [[East Asia]]n counterparts in terms of per capita GDP. In addition, in 2007, an [[absolute poverty]] incidence of 13.2 percent—higher than [[Indonesia]]’s 7.7 and [[Vietnam]]’s 8.4 percent—was recorded, illustrating the unequal distribution of wealth that inhibits growth and development for the Philippines.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

===Macroeconomic impacts of the crisis===
The Philippines was affected by the crisis in a decline in three aspects: exports, remittances from [[overseas Filipino]] workers, and foreign [[direct investment]]s. Heavily dependent on electronic and semiconductor exports, the Philippines saw a downward trend in its export earnings as countries in demand of these exports entered recession. The recession also put at risk the jobs in the developed countries which include those where [[migrant worker]]s are employed. Consequently, OFW remittances decreased and grew a meagre 3.3% in October 2008. [[Foreign direct investment]]s (FDI) declined because of investors losing confidence in the financial market. Lower FDIs mean slower economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Diokno, Benjamin, "Understanding the Global Economic Crisis", "(http://www.up.edu.ph/upforum.php?i=227)", May 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impacts on asset markets, financial sector, and real sector====
The freeze in [[liquidity]] in US and European financial markets reversed [[capital flow]]s to developing countries and induced a rise in the price of risk which entailed a drop in equity prices and [[exchange rate]] volatility.  However, following the effects of an increase in the foreign currency government bond spread, the Philippine [[stock market]] was actually one of the least affected by the crisis with the main index of the stock market dropping only by 24 percent, a relatively low percentage change in comparison to those of other countries across Asia. Similarly, from the period between July 2008 and January 2009, the [[peso]] depreciated only by 3 percent, meaning that the peso was one of the currencies least affected by the crisis. This minimal effect on the stock market and the Philippine peso can be attributed to the recovery of asset prices across the Asia-Pacific region in early 2009 as foreign portfolio investments surged.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

Financially, the [[banking system]] in the Philippines was relatively stable, because of reforms that were put in place since Asian financial crisis in 1997. Maintenance of high levels of loan to deposit ratios together with the decline of the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans kept profitability of local banking generally high despite the crisis. To the country's fortune, no meltdowns occurred as during the previous 1997 Asian crisis.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

Declines in the [[Economic growth|growth rate]] of personal consumption and expenditures and [[fixed investment]] occurred in 2008. Personal consumption expenditure, the largest contributor to GDP growth, showed a downward trend from a sharp drop from 5.8 percent in 2007 to 4.7 percent in 2008, and 3.7 percent in 2009.&lt;ref name="joeyssalceda.files.wordpress.com"&gt;Balisacan, Arsemio, et al., "Tackling Poverty and Social Impacts: Philippine Response to the Global Economic Crisis.", "(http://joeyssalceda.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/balisacan_study-revised_final_report_2jun20101.pdf)", May 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth during the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 fell to 1.7 percent, a staggering fall from a 5.7 percent average for the three previous years. Furthermore, a contraction of 29.2 percent occurred in the [[manufacturing sector]] involving electricity, gas, water, trade and finance services.   The [[service sector]] also turned down as growth in the fourth quarter and first quarters of 2008 and 2009, respectively, was a meagre growth of 2.1 percent, a far contrast from the 6.7 percent average from the previous three years.  However, the Philippines generally endured the smallest declines in comparison with other East Asian countries. For instance, OFW remittances, though at a slower pace, still grew in the first half of 2009.&lt;ref name="unicef.org"/&gt;

===Impact on fiscal deficit and external accounts===
To counter adverse effects of the crisis, the [[Philippine government]] felt the need to increase its expenditures. Apart from [[government expenditure]], of primary concern was the weak revenues generated by the government with the fiscal deficit reaching P111.8 billion in the first quarter of 2009 as compared to P25.8 billion in the same period of the previous year.  Despite suffering the least in terms of the stock exchange and financial markets among East Asian countries, the Philippines lagged in tax receipts in comparison to other nations. Meanwhile, private sector flows in the external account declined and led to a net outflow of $708 million in 2009, a sharp turning away from a net inflow of $507 million in 2008. This eventually led to a fall in stock prices and depreciation of the peso.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cuenca, Janet, Celia Reyes, Josef Yap, "Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on the Philippines", "(http://www.unicef.org/socialpolicy/files/Impact_of_the_Global_Finanical_and_Economic_Crisis_on_the_Philippines.pdf)", May 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poverty and social impacts===

====Impacts on households and communities====
An increasing number of Filipino workers became frustrated due to [[unemployment]] and low standards of living in the country. Thousands of Filipinos left the country every day to seize better income opportunities. Moreover, around five million Filipino children were unable to go to school and are forced to work on the streets or in other various workplaces where they could find some food.&lt;ref&gt;Fair Trade Alliance (FTA) Philippines, "A Nation in Crisis: Agenda for Survival", Fair Trade Alliance, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impacts on wealth and income and its distribution across different social divisions====
The country was having sound [[economic indicator]]s before the 2008 economic crisis. Average income per capita was increasing while poverty incidence showed a downward trend. Average income per capita rose by 2% in 2007 and 2008, whereas poverty incidence dropped from 33.0% in 2006 to 31.8% in 2007 and 28.1% in 2008. Output growth plunged in 2009, causing real mean income to fall by 2.1%, resulting in an upward pressure on poverty incidence (which grew by 1.6%). Most hit were households with associations to industry resulting in the average income to drop to levels below that of 2007. Similarly, wage and salary workers were hit significantly. Surprisingly, the poorest 20% did not suffer the same fate they suffered in crises past. The global economic crisis put a halt on the highly promising growth trend of the Philippine economy and forced 2 million Filipinos into poverty.&lt;ref name="joeyssalceda.files.wordpress.com"/&gt;

====Coping strategies====

i. Finances

Close to 22% of the population reduced their spending, 11% used their existing savings for consumption, 5% pawned assets, 2% sold assets, 36% borrowed money and 5% defaulted on debts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

ii. Education

To reduce spending, households had to risk the quality of [[education]] of their children. Some children were transferred from private to public schools, while some were withdrawn from school. Moreover, parents reduced the allowance of the students, and resorted to secondhand uniforms, shoes and books.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

iii. Health

Coping strategies may have negative effects on their long-term health as these affected households commonly resort to [[self-medication]], or shift to seeing doctors in government health centers and hospital. Many households in the urban sector shifted to generic drugs while rural households tended to use [[herbal medicine]]s,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; such as ''[[Blumea balsamifera|sambong]]'' for colds and kidney stones.

iv. Entertainment

Some people copied by watching popular "action films" such as ''[[Banta ng kahapon]]'' (1977).

===Policy responses===

====Efforts of poverty alleviation, reduction, eradication====
The Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) was implemented during the Ramos Administration and later on continued by the following administrations to help reduce poverty in the country and improve on the economic welfare of the Filipinos. The Ramos Administration (1993–1998) targeted to reduce poverty from 39.2% in 1991 to about 30% by 1998. The Estrada Administration (1999–2004) then targeted to reduce poverty incidence from 32% in 1997 to 25-28% by 2004,&lt;ref&gt;Reyes, Celia, Lani Valencia , "Poverty Reduction Strategy and Poverty Monitoring: Philippine Case Study", "(http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPAME/Resources/Country-studies/philippines_povmonitoring_casestudy.pdf)", May 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; while the Arroyo government targeted to reduce poverty to 17% by creating 10 million jobs but this promise was not fulfilled by the administration.&lt;ref&gt;GMA News Research, "Arroyo’s 10-point legacy: Big words, broken promises", "(http://www.gmanews.tv/story/169848/Arroyos-10-point-legacy-Big-words-broken-promises)", May 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Benigno Aquino III]] planned to expand the [[Conditional Cash Transfer]] (CCT) program from 1 to 2.3 million households, and several long term investments in education and healthcare. Also, in September 2010, Aquino met with US Secretary of State, [[Hillary Clinton]], during the signing of the $434-million [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]] (MCC) grant in New York. The MCC grant would fund infrastructure and [[rural development]] programs in the Philippines to reduce poverty and spur economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;ABS-CBN, "Clinton, Aquino talk about anti-poverty programs", "(http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/10/10/clinton-aquino-talk-about-anti-poverty-programs)", May 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Macroeconomic and social protection programs====
To respond to the financial crisis, the Philippine government, through the Department of Finance and [[National Economic and Development Authority]] (NEDA), crafted a PhP 330-billion fiscal package, formally known as the Economic Resiliency Plan (ERP).  The ERP was geared towards the stimulation of the economy through tax cuts, increased government spending, and public-private sector projects that could also prepare the country for the eventual upturn of the [[global economy]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The implementation of ERP was spearheaded by NEDA with the following specific aims:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

* To ensure sustainable growth, attaining the higher end of the growth rates;
* To save and create as many jobs as possible;
* To protect the most vulnerable sectors: the poorest of the poor, returning OFWs, and workers in export industries;
* To ensure low and stable prices to supports [[consumer spending]]; and
* To enhance competitiveness in preparation for the global rebound.

====Regional responses====
The Network of East Asian Think Tanks proposed the establishment of the Asia Investment Infrastructure Fund (AIIF) to prioritize the funding of infrastructure projects in the region to support suffering industries. The AIIF, as well as multilateral institutions (especially the [[Asian Development Bank]]), also promotes greater domestic demand and intra-regional trade to offset the decline in exports to industrialized countries and narrow the development gap in the region.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Employment discrimination law in the European Union''' comprises two [[Directive (European Union)|directives]]. The directives were agreed by all [[EU member states]] in 2000.  Each member state was then obliged to incorporate these new laws into their national legislation.&lt;ref name= "Chalmers, Davies, Monti 2011"&gt;{{cite book

==Background==
The Article 13 of the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]], entered into force in 1999, granted the [[European Union]] some powers to combat discrimination on the basis of:
* [[Race (classification of human beings)|Race]] or ethnic origin,
* Sex, Pregnancy
* [[sexual orientation]]
* Religion or belief
* [[Disability]] (physical or mental, including HIV status)
* [[Ageing|Age]] 

==Employment Equality Framework Directive (2000/78)==
The [[Employment Equality Framework Directive]] establishes a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation. It aims to protects everyone in the EU from discrimination based on age, disability, sexual orientation and religion or belief in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|date=27 November 2000|title=Council Directive 2000/78/EC|publisher=The Council of the European Union|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0078:EN:NOT|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racial Equality Directive (2000/43)==
The [[Racial Equality Directive]] prohibits discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin in the workplace as well as in other areas of life such as education, [[social security]], healthcare and access to goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|date=29 June 2000|title=Council Directive 2000/43/EC|publisher=The Council of the European Union|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0043:EN:HTML|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Whole Monaco.jpg|210px|thumb|Monaco is one of the few sovereign states not to be members of [[FIFA]].  ]]
'''[[Association football|Football]]''' is one of the leading sports in the small '''[[Principality of Monaco]]''', enjoying large popularity alongside [[motor racing]], [[yachting]], and [[tennis]]. It is governed by the [[Monegasque Football Federation]].

==International Football==
{{Main|Monaco national football team}}
Monaco is one of two sovereign European states (along with the Vatican City) that is not a [[UEFA]] member and doesn't have a national team competing in [[UEFA Euro]] qualifiers or [[FIFA World Cup]] qualifiers. The cause of this may be the historically close ties to France, but this is also true of [[Andorra]], while they have their own separate team. It may be purely because Monaco have never applied to join UEFA, despite fulfilling all the required criteria. In recent years, there has reportedly been more interest in achieving this status. 

The [[Monaco national football team|Monaco national team]] instead tend to play small-scale matches against non-FIFA members, usually across the border in [[Cap-d'Ail]].

==Domestic football==

===Club football===
{{Main|List of football clubs in Monaco}}

Domestic football within the principality is governed by the [[Monegasque Football Federation]], founded in 2000.

====AS Monaco====
Football in Monaco is dominated by [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]], who were founded in 1919 and play in the French [[Ligue 1]], which they have won on seven occasions, also winning five [[French Cup]]s in the process. The club have traditionally been heavily backed by the monarchy, with large financial support which helps the club compete with teams from much larger cities. The club plays at the Stade Louis II, where average attendances have sometimes been as low as 5,000 demonstrating the need for financial aid to compete with teams who draw crowds several times that figure. 

In 2004, they were runners-up in the [[UEFA Champions League]] to [[F.C. Porto|FC Porto]], widely regarded as the most prestigious club tournament in world-wide football. Their success and the large financial subsidy they receive has caused occasional bad feelings; it has been proposed, often by rival clubs in the Ligue 1, that AS Monaco should not be allowed to qualify for European competition from the French League, thereby taking a place allocated for a French team, with some even suggesting they should be expelled from French football altogether. 

One compromise that has been suggested is that AS Monaco continue to play in the French League system, but take part in a yearly qualifying tournament to earn the right to represent Monaco in European competition, as football teams in [[Canada]] do by the [[Canadian Championship]]. This solution would require the Principality to gain full or associate member status of UEFA first.

===Domestic cups===
Despite the small size of the country, Monaco still has many teams, and they compete yearly in different competitions, which are:
*[[Challenge Prince Rainier III]] - the most prestigious cup in Monaco.
*[[Trophée Ville de Monaco]] - the second level competition in the country.
*[[Challenge Monégasque]] - the third most important competition in Monaco.

==Super Cup==
Previously Monaco hosted the [[UEFA Super Cup]] between the winners of the [[UEFA Champions League]] and the [[UEFA Cup]]. [[UEFA]] announced that from [[2013 UEFA Super Cup|2013]] onwards, various stadiums will be used for the [[UEFA Super Cup|Super Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/aboutuefa/organisation/executivecommittee/news/newsid=1644074.html|title=Wembley, Amsterdam ArenA, Prague get 2013 finals|publisher=UEFA.com|date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2014-15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/aboutuefa/organisation/executivecommittee/news/newsid=1836837.html|title=UEFA EURO 2020, UEFA Super Cup decisions|publisher=UEFA.com|date=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Halay"'''  was the [[Turkey|Turkish]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1984]], performed in [[Turkish Language|Turkish]] by [[Beş Yıl Önce, On Yıl Sonra]].

The song was performed fifteenth on the night (following [[Germany]]'s [[Mary Roos]] with "[[Aufrecht geh'n]]" and preceding [[Finland]]'s [[Kirka]] with "[[Hengaillaan]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 37 points, placing 12th in a field of 19.

The song is about [[Yalli|Halay]] (typical dance in [[Turkey]] and [[Middle East]]), the band sings that they dance and sing with much love and don't look upon foreigners as strangers.

It was succeeded as [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest|Turkish representative]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985 Contest]] by [[MFÖ]] singing "[[Didai didai dai|Aşık oldum (Didai didai dai)]]". However, this song was not quite as well received.

'''"Hello From Mars"''' was the [[Latvia]]n entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003]], performed in [[English language|English]] by [[F.L.Y.]]

The lyrics are notably obscure, however the song appears to be a love song in which a pair of lovers reminisce about the way in which they met. The exact timing of this meeting appears to change throughout the song, with the chorus being in present or future tense ("Cause this is gonna be/The day that we will meet"), while the opening lines talk about "That day you saw me cry", implying a past tense situation. The song takes its title from the last lines of the chorus - "When heaven comes so down to earth/To say hello from Mars".

The song was performed twenty-first on the night, following [[Poland]]'s [[Ich Troje]] with "[[Keine Grenzen-Żadnych granic]]" and preceding [[Belgium]]'s [[Urban Trad]] with "[[Sanomi]]". At the close of voting, it had received 5 points (all from [[Estonia]]), placing 24th in a field of 26. Thus requiring Latvia to qualify from the semi-final at their next Contest appearance.

Somewhat perversely, the combination of unusual lyrics and a poor result for the host country has made the song relatively well-known among Contest fans.

It was succeeded as [[Latvia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Latvian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004 Contest]] by [[Fomins &amp; Kleins]] with "[[Dziesma par laimi]]".

{{Islam by country}}
The presence of '''Muslims in Latvia''' was first recorded in the early 19th century. The [[Muslims]] had mainly [[Tatar]] and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] backgrounds, and most had been brought to [[Latvia]] against their will. These included [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[prisoners of war]] from the [[Crimean War]] and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877. After the Russo-Turkish War almost one hundred Turkish prisoners were brought to the town of [[Cēsis]], where nearly 30 perished owing to harsh conditions of weather, under no suitable location for warmth and no protection for cold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.li.lv/index.php?Itemid=595&amp;id=102&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view]&lt;/ref&gt;

The total Muslim population in Latvia is estimated at about 2,000 by Pew Forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewforum.org/newassets/images/reports/Muslimpopulation/Muslimpopulation.pdf Mapping the global Muslim population; A Report on the Size and Distribution of the World’s Muslim Population; October 2009; p.31] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010050756/http://pewforum.org/newassets/images/reports/Muslimpopulation/Muslimpopulation.pdf |date=2009-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtually all Muslims in Latvia are [[Sunni]]. There is also an active presence of [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{curl=https://books.google.com/books?id=jmN6AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5Iiw4sudYr&amp;sig=-tXNu6iE-lgHc7EgQWchnEIwPZk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ICmKU8vfDsbTOZzMgMgE&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Islam in the Nordic and Baltic Countries | author=Göran Larsson | publisher=Routledge | page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
In 1902, a Muslim congregation was officially established and recognized by the government. The community elected Ibrahim Davidof as its leader and a prayer hall was inaugurated. The majority of Muslims residing in Latvia in the early part of the 20th century were conscripted in the [[Imperial Russian Army|Russian army]]. After release from service, most would leave for [[Moscow]]. 

During the creation of the [[Soviet Union]] and amid civil war, many refugees entered Latvia, including Muslims of various ethnicities. They were however known to [[Latvians]] as [[Turkish people|Turks]]. In 1928, Husnetdinov, a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] priest, was elected leader of Riga Muslim community. He held that post until 1940.

It was available both as a print edition published twice per week and a free online edition, and consisted entirely of small ads by private citizens. These ads were divided into categories for easy browsing. Placing an ad was free of charge, but extra stand-out features and [[photograph]]s costed money.

''Keltainen Pörssi'' had several [[supplement (publishing)|supplement]]s, including ''Autot''.&lt;ref name="san6"/&gt;

In 2016 the publication was wound down and visits to the web address directed users to the [[Huuto.net]] site, this is a online ''auction'' and ''buy it now''  site similar to eBay that caters for the Finnish market.  Keltainen Pörssi was owned by the same media group with Huuto.net and [[Ilta-Sanomat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hujanen|first1=Miikka|title=Keltainen Pörssi lopettaa – palstalla ostettiin salmiakkikossua, merikarhu etsi naisseuraa...|url=http://www.is.fi/kotimaa/art-2000001208957.html|accessdate=5 June 2017|date=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lonnie Thompson''' (born July 1, 1948), is an American [[paleoclimatologist]] and Distinguished University Professor in the School of [[Earth Sciences]] at [[The Ohio State University]]. He has achieved global recognition for his drilling and analysis of [[ice core]]s from mountain glaciers and ice caps in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. He and his wife, Ellen Mosley-Thompson, run the ice core paleoclimatology research group at the [[Byrd Polar Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Byrd Polar Research Center Directory |url=http://bprc.osu.edu/directory/?sort=group |date=29 September 2009 |accessdate=19 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Biography==
Lonnie Thompson (Lanyard) was born July 1, 1948 in [[Gassaway, West Virginia]]. He was raised on a farm near Gassaway, W.Va.&lt;ref name="Gillis"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gillis|first=Justin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/science/earth/lonnie-thompson-climate-scientist-battles-time.html?pagewanted=all|title=A Climate Scientist Battles Time and Mortality|accessdate=July 3, 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He obtained his undergraduate degree from [[Marshall University]], where he majored in geology. He subsequently attended [[Ohio State University|The Ohio State University]] where he received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in geology. In the 1970s, he was the first scientist "to retrieve ice samples from a remote tropical ice cap, such as the [[Quelccaya]] ice cap in the Andes of Peru,&lt;ref name="Gillis"/&gt; and analyze them for ancient climate signals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lonnie Thompson to Receive National Medal of Science |publisher=Ohio State University, Research News |year=2007 |url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/ltmdlsci.htm |accessdate=19 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610083641/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/ltmdlsci.htm |archivedate=10 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He created the ice core research program at Ohio State while still a graduate student there. In regards to the dedication required to attain this ice, one author writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mark Bowen |year=2005 |title=Thin Ice |isbn=0-8050-6443-5 |publisher=[[Henry Holt and Co.]] |pages=320 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In his efforts to obtain ice cores, Thompson has spent an enormous amount of time at elevations above 5,500 meters. High-altitude climbers typically tackle a peak by spending time in a series of camps at lower elevations to acclimatize and then making a final rushed push for the summit. But Thompson and his loyal band of colleagues, students and mountain guides spend literally months at a time working at altitude...

Thompson and his colleagues have managed to drill into tropical glaciers with nothing more to rely on than a combination of modest funding, low-tech equipment, ingenuity and sheer muscle power. Because the thin air at high altitudes precludes the use of helicopters, all of the drilling equipment and supplies must be carried up and down the slopes by yaks, mules, horses or humans...|[[Mark Bowen (writer)|Mark Bowen]], ''Thin Ice''}}

For comparison, the [[Everest]] lower base camp is at 5,380 m (17,700&amp;nbsp;ft) and the upper base camp is at 6,500 m (21,300&amp;nbsp;ft). (The mountain itself is 8,848 m (29,029&amp;nbsp;ft).) ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine says that there is no person in the world who has spent more time above 18,000 feet than Lonnie Thompson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Ice Hunter |date=3 November 2005 |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/8742355/the_ice_hunter/ |accessdate=19 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430072521/http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/8742355/the_ice_hunter/ |archivedate=30 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His observations of glacier retreat (1970s–2000s) "confirm that glaciers around the world are melting and provide clear evidence that the warming of the last 50 years is now outside the range of climate variability for several millennia, if not longer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lonnie Thompson CV (short) |url=http://bprc.osu.edu/Icecore/vitae/lgt%20short%20vita.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011143546/http://bprc.osu.edu/Icecore/vitae/lgt%20short%20vita.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 October 2008 |accessdate=19 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he predicted that the famed snows of Africa’s [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] would melt within the next 20 years, a victim of climate change across the tropics. Return expeditions to the mountain have shown that changes in the mountain’s ice fields may signal an even quicker melting of its snow fields, which Thompson documented had existed for thousands of years. Thompson and his wife both served as advisers for the Academy Award-winning 2006 documentary ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'', by [[Al Gore|Al Gore, Jr.]], and some of their work was referenced in the movie.

On May 1, 2012, he underwent a successful heart transplant.&lt;ref name="Gillis"/&gt;

'''MeDirect Bank Malta''' is a [[Malta|Maltese]] [[bank]] and financial services company with headquarters in [[Sliema]]. Founded in 2004 as Mediterranean Bank, it was licensed by the [[Malta Financial Services Authority]] in 2005.

Mediterranean Bank however struggled to fully maximise the potential of its business model, which was that of an [[offshore bank]],&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20140424/business-news/Med-Bank-a-different-business-model.516243|title=Med Bank: a different business model|website=Timesofmalta.com|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in view of Malta joining the [[European Union]]. Four years later, in 2009, it was acquired by [[AnaCap Financial Partners]] in a bid to revitalise it.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The bank mostly operates in the corporate sector,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.medcorpbank.com.mt|title=MeDirect - Business Banking|website=Medcorpbank.com.mt|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Wealth Management, Investment, and Savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financemalta.org/member/624/|title=MeDirect|website=Financemalta.org|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank has branches all over Malta, including [[Gozo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gozonews.com/24550/mediterranean-bank-opens-its-new-gozo-branch-in-victoria/|title=Mediterranean Bank opens its new Gozo branch in Victoria|work=Gozo News.Com|access-date=2017-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the bank was offering fixed term deposit interest rates of 4.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2010-02-21/news/mediterranean-bank-introduces-fixed-term-deposit-at-45-interest-270625/|title=Mediterranean Bank Introduces fixed term deposit at 4.5% interest - The Malta Independent|website=Independent.com.mt|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; MeDirect Bank Malta purchased [[Volksbank]] Malta in 2014, and merged operations. In 2015, Charts Investment Management Service Ltd was also acquired.

Meanwhile, in 2013, the MeDirect Bank Malta opened a branch in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], branded as [[MeDirect]]. In June 2015, MeDirect received a [https://www.mijnkapitaal.be/obligaties-spaarverzekeringen/sparen/medirect-bank-nv-100-belgisch/ Belgian banking license] of the National Bank of Belgium. This means that the savings products are covered by the Belgian guarantee scheme. This became recognised by Belgian authorities by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.medbank.com.mt/Business/about-us|title=About Us - MedBank Business|website=Medbank.com.mt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its Corporate Social Responsibility, MeDirect Bank Malta sponsors the [[Malta Rugby Union National Cup]], which is in fact known as the Mediterranean Bank Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvm.com.mt/mt/sports/rugby-stompers-jirbhu-l-mediterranean-bank-cup/|title=Rugby - Stompers jirbħu l-Mediterranean Bank Cup - TVM|website=Tvm.com.mt|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportinmalta.com/mrfu-launches-2017-mediterranean-bank-cup/|title=MRFU Launches 2017 Mediterranean Bank Cup|website=Sportinmalta.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20170106/rugby/new-format-for-the-2017-mediterranean-bank-cup.635769|title=New format for the 2017 Mediterranean Bank Cup|website=Timesofmalta.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement goes way back to 2010 when the bank first sponsored the endeavours of the [[Malta Rugby Football Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2010-11-11/sports-others/Rugby:-%E2%82%AC25,000-Sponsorship-for-Rugby-Union-from-Mediterranean-Bank-283053|title=Rugby: €25,000 Sponsorship for Rugby Union from Mediterranean Bank - The Malta Independent|website=Independent.com.mt|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/news/malta_rugby_allies_with_mediterranean_bank|title=Malta Rugby allies with Mediterranean Bank|website=Sportspromedia.com|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its consolidation strategy, Mediterranean Bank underwent a rebranding exercise in November 2017, adopting the name of MeDirect Bank (Malta).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20171029/business-news/Think-ahead-Bank-ahead.661666|title=Think ahead.

The '''Microfinance Investment Support Facility for Afghanistan (MISFA)''' was set up in 2003 at the invitation of the [[government of Afghanistan|Afghan government]] to streamline collection of [[charitable donation|donor money]] and avoid pitfalls arising from conflicting donor interests that had been seen in other post-conflict situations. It was established as a vehicle through which the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] government and international donors could channel technical assistance and funding to build Afghanistan’s [[microfinance]] sector.

In March 2006, MISFA registered as a [[limited liability company|limited liability]], [[non-profit company]] whose sole shareholder is the [[Ministry of Finance (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Finance of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan]]. MISFA Ltd is an independent apex organization with a number of implementing partners on the ground. In most cases, MISFA functions as either the exclusive or primary provider of funds to its partners. The legal status of MFIs has been transformed from [[NGO]]s to that of non-profit companies registered with the [[Afghanistan Investment Support Agency]] (AISA), as permanent institutions under the [[law of Afghanistan]].

The '''Naters Brass Quintet''' (NBQ) was a small group formed in 1990, and is known for its modern entertainment music.  In 1992, the NBQ won the vice-champion title at the [[Swiss Ensemble and Soloist Competition]] (SSEW) in [[Interlaken]], where it also played at the Gala concert.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The group cooperated with lesser-known musicians such as Anselmo Loretan, Eduard Zurwerra and Peter Warlen.  Stefan Imboden acted as their trainer for many years, which led to the success of the NBQ.

The '''Parochial Union of Independents Group''' ({{lang-ca|Grup d'Unió Parroquial Independents}}, GUPI) is a local [[progressivism|progressive]] [[political party]] in [[Ordino]], [[Andorra]].

==History==
In the local elections in 2003 GUPI won two of the ten seats in Ordino. For the [[Andorran parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary elections]] the party was part of an alliance with the [[Social Democratic Party (Andorra)|Social Democratic Party]] and [[Democratic Renewal (Andorra)|Democratic Renewal]] named '''L'Alternativa'''.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen D]] &amp; Stöver P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p164 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance won twelve seats.

GUPI retained its alliance with the Social Democratic Party for the [[Andorran parliamentary election, 2009|2009 elections]], with the coalition emerging victorious after winning 14 of the 28 seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2005_09.htm Elections in 2009] IPU&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proletarian internationalism''', sometimes referred to as '''international socialism''', is the perception of all [[Communist revolution|communist revolution]]s as being part of a single global class struggle rather than separate localized events.&lt;ref name=Oxford1&gt;{{cite book|last=Leopold|first=David|editor1-last=Freeden|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Stears|editor2-first=Marc|editor3-last=Sargent|editor3-first=Lyman Tower|title=The Oxford Handbook of Political Ideologies|date=2015|pages=20-38|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0198744337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oxford2&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwarzmantle|first=John|editor-last=Breuilly|editor-first=John|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Nationalism|date=2017|pages=643-651|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0198768203}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the theory that [[capitalism]] is a [[world-system]] and therefore the [[working class]]es of all nations must act in concert if they are to replace it with [[communism]].&lt;ref name="HDM"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Elliott|last2=Walker|first2=David|last3=Gray|first3=Daniel|year=2014|title=Historical Dictionary of Marxism|series=Historical Dictionaries of Religions, Philosophies, and Movements|edition=2nd|location=Lanham, Maryland|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-1-4422-3798-8

Proletarian internationalism is closely linked to goals of [[world revolution]], to be achieved through successive or simultaneous communist revolutions in all nations. According to [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]], successful proletarian internationalism should lead to [[world communism]] and eventually [[Communist society|stateless communism]].&lt;ref&gt;N.I. Bukharin,'' Marx's Teaching and its Historical Importance'', [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1933/teaching/4.htm Chapter 4: The Theory of Proletarian Dictatorship and Scientific Communism] in Nikolai Bukharin and Others, ''Marxism and Modern Thought'' (George Routledge &amp; Sons Ltd., 1935), page 1-90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Lenin, The ''State and Revolution: The Marxist Theory of the State &amp; the Tasks of the Proletariat in the Revolution'' (1918), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm Chapter V: The Economic Basis of the Withering Away of the State], Collected Works, Volume 25, p. 381-492&lt;/ref&gt; The notion was strongly embraced by the first communist party, the [[Communist League]], as exercised through its slogan "[[Workers of the world, unite!|Proletarians of all countries, unite!]]", later popularized as "Workers of the world, unite!" in English literature.&lt;ref name="HDM"/&gt;

Proletarian internationalism was originally embraced by the [[Bolshevik Party]] during its seizure of power in the [[Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref name="HDM"/&gt; After the formation of the [[Soviet Union]], Marxist proponents of internationalism suggested that country could be used as a "homeland of communism" from which revolution could be spread around the globe.&lt;ref name=Oxford2/&gt; Though world revolution continued to figure prominently in Soviet rhetoric for decades, it no longer superseded domestic concerns on the government's agenda, especially after the ascension of [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref name="HDM"/&gt; Despite this, the Soviet Union continued to foster international ties with communist and left-wing parties and governments around the world.&lt;ref name="HDM"/&gt; It played a fundamental role in the establisment of several [[Socialist state|socialist states]] in [[Eastern Europe]] after [[World War II]] and backed the creation of others in Asia, Latin America and Africa.&lt;ref name=Lansford&gt;{{cite book|last=Lansford|first=Thomas|title=Communism|date=2007|pages=9-24, 36-44|publisher=Cavendish Square Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-0761426288}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets also funded dozens of insurgencies being waged against non-communist governments by leftist guerrilla movements worldwide.&lt;ref name=Revolutions&gt;{{cite book|last=MacFarlane|first=S. Neil|editor-last=Katz|editor-first=Mark|title=The USSR and Marxist Revolutions in the Third World|date=1990|pages=6-11|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0812216202}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few other states later exercised their own commitments to the cause of world revolution—for instance, [[Cuba]] frequently dispatched internationalist military missions abroad to defend communist interests in Africa and the Caribbean.&lt;ref name="HDM"/&gt;

== Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels ==
Proletarian internationalism is summed up in the slogan coined by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], "[[Workers of all countries, unite!]]", the last line of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', published in 1848. However, Marx and Engels' approach to the national question was also shaped by tactical considerations in their pursuit of a long-term revolutionary strategy. In 1848, the [[proletariat]] was a small minority in all but a handful of countries.&lt;ref&gt;Citation needed&lt;/ref&gt; Political and economic conditions needed to ripen in order to advance the possibility of proletarian revolution.

For instance, Marx and Engels supported the emergence of an independent and democratic Poland, which at the time was divided between Germany, Russia and Austria-Hungary. Rosa Luxemburg's biographer Peter Nettl writes: "In general, Marx and Engels' conception of the national-geographical rearrangement of Europe was based on four criteria: the development of progress, the creation of large-scale economic units, the weighting of approval and disapproval in accordance with revolutionary possibilities, and their specific enmity to Russia".&lt;ref&gt;J.P Nettl, "Rosa Luxemburg", Oxford University Press 1969. Nettl is quoting Hans-Ulrich Wehler's study, "Sozialdemokratie and Nationalstaat" (Würzburg, 1962)&lt;/ref&gt; Russia was seen as the heartland of European reaction at the time.

== First International ==
The [[trade union]]ists who formed the International Workingmen's Association (IWA), sometimes called the [[First International]], recognised that the working class was an international class which had to link its struggle on an international scale. By joining together across national borders, the workers would gain greater bargaining power and political influence.

Founded in 1864, the IWA was the first mass movement with a specifically international focus. At its peak, the IWA had 5 million members according to police reports from the various countries in which it had a significant presence.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Robert. "Marx: A Biography". Simon and Schuster. New York, 1968. p372&lt;/ref&gt; Repression in Europe and internal divisions between the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and [[Marxism|Marxist]] currents led eventually to its dissolution in 1876. Shortly thereafter, the Marxist and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] tendencies continued the internationalist strategy of the IWA through the successor organisation of the Second International, though without the inclusion of the anarchist and [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] movements.

== Second International ==
Proletarian internationalism was perhaps best expressed in the resolution sponsored by [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]] at the Seventh Congress of the [[Second International]] at Stuttgart in 1907 which asserted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Wars between capitalist states are, as a rule, the outcome of their competition on the world market, for each state seeks not only to secure its existing markets, but also to conquer new ones. In this, the subjugation of foreign peoples and countries plays a prominent role. These wars result furthermore from the incessant race for armaments by militarism, one of the chief instruments of bourgeois class rule and of the economic and political subjugation of the working class.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Wars are favored by the national prejudices which are systematically cultivated among civilized peoples in the interest of the ruling classes for the purpose of distracting the proletarian masses from their own class tasks as well as from their duties of international solidarity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Wars, therefore, are part of the very nature of capitalism; they will cease only when the capitalist system is abolished or when the enormous sacrifices in men and money required by the advance in military technique and the indignation called forth by armaments, drive the peoples to abolish this system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The resolution concluded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If a war threatens to break out, it is the duty of the working classes and their parliamentary representatives in the countries involved, supported by the coordinating activity of the International Socialist Bureau, to exert every effort in order to prevent the outbreak of war by the means they consider most effective, which naturally vary according to the sharpening of the class struggle and the sharpening of the general political situation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In case war should break out anyway, it is their duty to intervene in favor of its speedy termination and with all their powers to utilize the economic and political crisis created by the war to rouse the masses and thereby to hasten the downfall of capitalist class rule.&lt;ref&gt;International Socialist Congress at Stuttgart, August 18–24, 1907 Vorwärts Publishers, Berlin, 1907, pp. 64-66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In fact, Luxemburg and Lenin had very different interpretations of the national question. Lenin and the [[Bolsheviks]] opposed [[imperialism]] and [[chauvinism]] by advocating a policy of [[national self-determination]], including the right of oppressed nations to secede from Russia. They believed this would help to create the conditions for unity between the workers in both oppressing and oppressed nations. Specifically, Lenin claimed: "The [[bourgeois nationalism]] of any oppressed nation has a general democratic content that is directed against oppression and it is this content that we unconditionally support".&lt;ref&gt;Lenin, The Right of Nations to Self-Determination.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Luxemburg broke with the mainstream [[Polish Socialist Party]] in 1893 on the national question.

Luxemburg argued that the nature of Russia had changed since Marx’s day as Russia was now fast developing as a major capitalist nation while the Polish bourgeoisie now had its interests linked to Russian capitalism. This had opened the possibility of a class alliance between the Polish and Russian working class.

The leading party of the Second International, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], voted overwhelmingly in support of Germany's entry into [[World War I]] by approving war credits on 4 August 1914. Many other member parties of the Second International followed suit by supporting national governments and the Second International was dissolved in 1916. Proletarian internationalists characterized the combination of [[social democracy]] and [[nationalism]] as [[social chauvinism]].

== World War I ==
The hopes of internationalists such as Lenin, Luxemburg and [[Karl Liebknecht]] were dashed by the initial enthusiasm for war. Lenin tried to re-establish socialist unity against the war at the [[Zimmerwald Conference]], but the majority of delegates took a [[Pacifism|pacifist]] rather than a [[revolution]]ary position.

In prison, Luxemburg deepened her analysis with ''The Junius Pamphlet'' of 1915. In this document, she specifically rejects the notion of oppressor and oppressed states: "Imperialism is not the creation of one or any group of states. It is the product of a particular stage of ripeness in the world development of capital, an innately international condition, an indivisible whole, that is recognisable only in all its relations, and from which no nation can hold aloof at will".&lt;ref&gt;Rosa Luxemburg, "The Junius Pamphlet" 1915.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proletarian internationalists now argued that the alliances of World War I had proved that [[socialism]] and nationalism were incompatible in the imperialist era, that the concept of national self-determination had become outdated and in particular that nationalism would prove to be an obstacle to proletarian unity. Anarcho-syndicalism was a further working class political current that characterised the war as imperialist on all sides, finding organisational expression in the [[Industrial Workers of the World]].

The internationalist perspective influenced the revolutionary wave towards the end of World War II, notably with [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Russia's withdrawal from the conflict]] following the [[October Revolution]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|revolt in Germany]] beginning in the naval ports of [[Kiel]] and [[Wilhelmshaven]] that brought the war to an end in November 1918. However, once this revolutionary wave had receded in the early 1920s, proletarian internationalism was no longer mainstream in working class politics.

== Third International: Leninism versus left communism ==
{{Anarcho-communism sidebar|Concepts}}
Following World War I, the international socialist movement was irreconcilably split into two hostile factions: on the one side, the social democrats, who broadly supported their national governments during the conflict; and on the other side [[Leninism|Leninists]] and their allies who formed the new [[Communist party|communist parties]] that were organised into the [[Third International]], which was established in March 1919. During the [[Russian Civil War]], Lenin and [[Leon Trotsky]] more firmly embraced the concept of national self-determination for tactical reasons. In the Third International, the national question became a major bone of contention between mainstream Leninists and "[[left communists]]". 

By the time [[World War II]] broke out in 1939, only a few prominent communists such as the Italian Marxist [[Amadeo Bordiga]] and the Dutch [[Council communism|council communist]] [[Anton Pannekoek]] remained opponents of Russia's embrace of national self-determination. Following the collapse of the [[Fascist Italy (1922-43)|Mussolini regime]] in Italy in 1943, Bordigists regrouped and founded the [[International Communist Party]] (PCInt). The first edition of the party organ, ''Prometeo'' (''Prometheus''), proclaimed: "Workers! Against the slogan of a national war which arms Italian workers against English and German proletarians, oppose the slogan of the communist revolution, which unites the workers of the world against their common enemy — capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;Prometeo, 1 November 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; The PCInt took the view that Luxemburg, not Lenin, had been right on the [[National Question#In socialism|national question]].

There was a revival of interest in internationalist theory after World War II, when the extent of communist influence in Eastern Europe dramatically increased as a result of postwar [[military occupations by the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=Rupprecht&gt;{{cite book|last=Rupprecht|first=Tobias|title=Soviet Internationalism after Stalin: Interaction and Exchange between the USSR and Latin America during the Cold War|date=1997|pages=9-11|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1107102880}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet government defined its relationship with Eastern European states it occupied such as [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]] and [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] as based on the principles of proletarian internationalism.&lt;ref name=Valdez&gt;{{cite book|last=Valdez|first=Jonathan|title=Internationalism and the Ideology of Soviet Influence in Eastern Europe|date=1993|pages=24, 63, 76|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521414388}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was used to justify installing "[[People's democracy (Marxism–Leninism)|people's democracies]]" in these states, which were to oversee the transition from [[fascism]] to [[communism]].&lt;ref name=Valdez/&gt; By the early 1960s, this thinking was considered obsolete as most of the "people's democracies" had established cohesive postwar communist states.&lt;ref name=Valdez/&gt; Marxist ideologues believed that proletarian internationalism was no longer accurate to describe Soviet relations with the newly emerging [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern European communist bloc]], so a new term was coined, namely [[socialist internationalism]].&lt;ref name=Valdez/&gt; According to Soviet internationalist theory under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], proletarian internationalism could only be evoked to describe solidarity between international peoples and parties, not governments.&lt;ref name=Rupprecht/&gt; Inter-state relationships fell into a parallel category, socialist internationalism.&lt;ref name=Rupprecht/&gt;

Socialist internationalism was considerably less militant than proletarian internationalism as it was not focused on the spread of revolution, but diplomatic, political and to a lesser extent cultural solidarity between preexisting regimes.&lt;ref name=Rupprecht/&gt; Under the principles of socialist internationalism, the [[Warsaw Pact]] governments were encouraged to pursue various forms of economic or military cooperation with each other and Moscow.&lt;ref name=Valdez/&gt; At the Moscow [[1969 International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties|International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties]] in June 1969, seventy-five communist parties from around the world formally defined and endorsed the theory of socialist internationalism.&lt;ref name=Valdez/&gt; One of the key tenets of socialist internationalism as expressed during the conference was that the "defense of socialism is the international duty of communists", meaning communist governments should be obliged to assist each other militarily to defend their common interests against external aggression.&lt;ref name=Valdez/&gt;

Khrushchev's successor, [[Leonid Brezhnev]], was an even more outspoken proponent of both proletarian and socialist internationalism. In 1976, Brezhnev declared that proletarian internationalism was neither dead nor obsolete and reaffirmed the [[Soviet Union]]'s commitment to its core concepts of "the solidarity of the working class, of communists of all countries in the struggle for common goals, the solidarity in the struggle of the peoples for national liberation and social progress, [and] voluntary cooperation of the fraternal parties with strict observance of the equality and independence of each".&lt;ref name=Valdez/&gt; Under Brezhnev, the Soviet and Warsaw Pact governments frequently evoked proletarian internationalism to fund leftist trade unions and guerrilla insurgencies around the globe.&lt;ref name=Hot&gt;{{cite book|last=Shubin|first=Vladimir Gennadyevich|title=The Hot "Cold War": The USSR in Southern Africa|date=2008|page=9|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-7453-2472-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign military interventions could also be justified as "internationalist duty" to defend or support other communist states during wartime.&lt;ref name=Reappraisal&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duignan|first1=Peter|last2=Gann|first2=L.H|title=Communism in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Reappraisal|date=2008|page=19-23|publisher=Hoover Institution Press|location=Stanford|isbn=978-0817937126}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Soviet financial or military backing, a considerable number of new communist governments succeeded in assuming power during the late 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=Revolutions/&gt; The United States and its allies perceived this as an example of Soviet expansionism and this aspect of Brezhnev's foreign policy negatively affected diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the West.&lt;ref name=Revolutions/&gt;

Outside of the Warsaw Pact, [[Cuba]] embraced its own aggressive theory of proletarian internationalism, which was primarily exercised through support for leftist revolutionary movements.&lt;ref name="HDM"/&gt; One of the fundamental aspects of Cuban foreign policy between 1962 and 1990 was the "rule of internationalism", which dictated that Cuba must first and foremost support the cause of international revolution through whatever means are available to her.&lt;ref name=Cuba&gt;{{cite book|last=Domínguez|first=Jorge|title=To Make a World Safe for Revolution: Cuba's Foreign Policy|date=1989|pages=114–120, 168|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0674893252}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the founding of the [[Organization of Solidarity with the People of Asia, Africa and Latin America]] in 1966, Cuban President [[Fidel Castro]] declared that "for Cuban revolutionaries, the battleground against imperialism encompasses the entire world...the enemy is one and the same, the same one who attacks our shores and our territory, the same one who attacks everyone else. And so we say and proclaim that the revolutionary movement in every corner of the world can count on Cuban combat fighters".&lt;ref name=Cuba/&gt; By the mid 1980s, it was estimated that up to a quarter of Cuba's national military was deployed overseas, fighting with communist governments or factions in various civil conflicts.&lt;ref name=Reappraisal/&gt; The Cuban military saw action against the United States while fighting on behalf of the Marxist [[New Jewel Movement]] in [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|Grenada]].&lt;ref name=Cuba/&gt; It was also instrumental in installing a communist government in [[People's Republic of Angola|Angola]] and fighting several costly campaigns during that nation's [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]].&lt;ref name="Weigert"&gt;{{cite book|title=Angola: A Modern Military History|last=Weigert|first=Stephen|year=2011|location=Basingstoke|publisher=Palgrave-Macmillan|isbn=978-0230117778|pages=56–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proletarian internationalism today ==
Some political groupings such as the PCInt, the [[International Communist Current]] and the [[International Bureau for the Revolutionary Party]] (which includes the PCInt) follow the Luxemburgist and Bordigist interpretations of proletarian internationalism as do some [[Libertarian Marxism|libertarian communists]].

== Leftist opposition to proletarian internationalism ==
In contrast, some socialists have pointed out that social realities such as local loyalties and cultural barriers militate against proletarian internationalism. For example, [[George Orwell]] believed that "in all countries the poor are more national than the rich".&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, Collected Essays, "[[The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius|The Lion and the Unicorn]]".&lt;/ref&gt; To this, Marxists might counter that while the rich may have historically had the awareness and education to recognize cross-national interest of class, the poor of those same nations likely have not had this advantage, making them more susceptible to what Marxists would describe as the false ideology of [[patriotism]]. Marxists assert that patriotism and nationalism serve precisely to obscure opposing class interests that would otherwise pose a threat to the ruling class order.

Marxists would also point out that in times of intense revolutionary struggle (the most evident being the revolutionary periods of [[Revolutions of 1848|184]][[Revolutions of 1917–1923|8–1]]498, [[Revolutions of 1917–1923|1917–1923]] and [[Protests of 1968|1968]]) internationalism within the proletariat can overtake petty nationalisms as intense class struggles break out in multiple nations at the same time and the workers of those nations discover that they have more in common with other workers than with their own bourgeoisie.

On the question of imperialism and national determination, proponents of [[Third-Worldism]] argue that workers in "oppressor" nations (such as the United States or Israel) must first support national liberation movements in "oppressed" nations (such as Afghanistan or Palestine) before there can be any basis for proletarian internationalism. For example, [[Tony Cliff]], a leading figure of the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|British Socialist Workers Party]], denied the possibility of solidarity between Palestinians and Israelis in the current Middle East situation, writing that "Israel is not a colony suppressed by imperialism, but a settler’s citadel, a launching pad of imperialism. It is a tragedy that some of the very people who had been persecuted and massacred in such bestial fashion should themselves be driven into a chauvinistic, militaristic fervour, and become the blind tool of imperialism in subjugating the Arab masses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=17125/ |title=(Britain) - Front Page |publisher=Socialist Worker |date= |accessdate=2015-11-28 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] argue that there must be a [[permanent revolution]] in [[Third World|Third World countries]] in which a bourgeoisie revolution will inevitably lead to a worker's revolution with an international scope. This can be seen in the October Revolution before the movement was stopped by Stalin, a proponent of [[Socialism in One Country|socialism in one country]]. Because of this threat, the bourgeoisie in Third World countries will willingly subjugate themselves to national and capitalist interests in order to prevent a proletarian uprising.

Internationalists would respond that [[capitalism]] has proved itself incapable of resolving the competing claims of different nationalisms and that the working class (of all countries) is oppressed by capitalism, not by other workers. Moreover, the [[Globalization|global nature of capitalism]] and [[international finance]] make "[[national liberation]]" an impossibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.internationalism.org/pamphlets/nationorclass/ |title=Nation or Class? &amp;#124; International Communist Current |publisher=En.internationalism.org |date=2006-01-27 |accessdate=2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For internationalists, all national liberation movements, whatever their "[[Progressivism|progressive]]" gloss, are therefore obstacles to the communist goal of world revolution.

'''R1''' is an [[Highways in Slovakia|expressway]] ({{lang-sk|rýchlostná cesta}}) in [[Slovakia]]. It starts near [[Trnava]] ([[Motorway D1 (Slovakia)|D1]]) and ends in [[Ružomberok]] (D1) and it goes through or around [[Nitra]], [[Hronský Beňadik]], [[Žarnovica]], [[Žiar nad Hronom]] ([[Expressway R2 (Slovakia)|R2]]/[[Expressway R3 (Slovakia)|R3]]), [[Zvolen]] and [[Banská Bystrica]]. 

From 225&amp;nbsp;km there are:
* 175,7&amp;nbsp;km in operation
* app. 50&amp;nbsp;km planned

The former partial designation of this route was D65.

Currently (as of May 2013), continuous section between Trnava and bypass of Banská Bystrica is in operation. A linking section to Ružomberok and consequently back to motorway D1 has been planned since 2008. Both sections, Nitra-Hronský Beňadik and bypass of Banská Bystrica, were built, and are operated under the conditions of a [[Public-private partnership]] project, unlike the rest of Slovak motorway and expressway network.

The '''Satu Mare Swabians''' or '''Sathmar Swabians'''&lt;ref name="Barcan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steigerwald"/&gt; (German: '''Sathmarer Schwaben''') are a [[Germans|German]] ethnic group in the [[Satu Mare]] region of [[Romania]].&lt;ref name="Barcan"&gt;Monica Barcan, Adalbert Millitz, ''The German Nationality in Romania'' (1978), page 42: "The Satu Mare Swabians are true Swabians, their place of origin being Wurttemberg. They were colonized between 1712 and 1815. Their most important settlements are Satu Mare/Sathmar and Petresti/Petrifeld in North- West Romania."&lt;/ref&gt; They are one of the few [[Danube Swabian]] subgroups that are actually [[Swabia]]n,&lt;ref name="Barcan"/&gt; and their dialect, [[Sathmar Swabian]], is similar to other varieties of [[Swabian German|Swabian]].

Most were originally farmers in Upper [[Swabia]] who came to [[Partium]] (at the time [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], now Romania) during the [[East Colonisation]] in the 1700s.&lt;ref name="Barcan"/&gt; Their principal settlements were [[Satu Mare|Satu Mare (Sathmar)]], [[Carei|Carei (Karol)]], [[Petrești, Satu Mare|Petrești (Petrifeld)]],&lt;ref name="Barcan"/&gt; and [[Foieni|Foieni (Fienen)]], and they also inhabited [[Urziceni, Satu Mare|Urziceni]] (Schinal), [[Căpleni]] (Kaplau), [[Tiream]] (Terem), [[Beltiug]] (Bildegg), [[Ciumești]] (Schamagosch), and [[Ardud]] (Erdeed).

After the [[Second World War]], many evacuated, migrated or were expelled to [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="Steigerwald"&gt;Jacob Steigerwald, ''Tracing Romania's heterogeneous German minority from its origins to the Diaspora'' (1985), page 14: "Since the final stages of WWII, Romania has not been the only country where substantial groups of Sathmar Swabians can be found. For over thirty-five years now, there has been a growing community of Sathmar Swabians in West Germany also."&lt;/ref&gt; Those that remain in Romania, along with other German-speaking groups in Romania, are represented in politics by the DFDR ([[Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania]]).

Dr Sriprakash Kothari,  was named as the chairperson of the second World Hindu Congress &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/top-mit-professor-to-chair-world-hindu-congress-in-chicago/articleshow/64580910.cms |title=Top MIT professor to chair World Hindu Congress in Chicago |publisher=The Times Of India }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Introduction==
{{unreferenced-section|date=August 2018}}
The WHEF seeks to bring together financially successful individuals from the Hindu Society, such as traders, bankers, technocrats, investors, industrialists, businessmen, professionals, economists, and thinkers under one roof so that each group can share their business knowledge, experience, and expertise with their fellow brethren to make them understand the principles of surplus wealth generation to make society prosperous.

==History==
{{unreferenced-section|date=August 2018}}
The forum was founded by Shri Swami Vigyananand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldhindunews.com/2014/08/07/29204/bio-profile-of-swami-vigyananand-ji/ |title=Bio-Profile of Swami Vigyananand ji |publisher=World Hindu News }}&lt;/ref&gt; , an Alumnus of the [[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur]]. He says "We are now living in the 21st century, equipped with all the advanced technologies like airplane, internet, mobiles, and other modern facilities. When we go back in time to recollect the age of torture, destruction, suppression and humiliation that our forefathers underwent, we should derive inspiration from the fact that when our ancestors worked and survived in such difficult times and conditions, so what stops us from excelling in these technologically advanced times?"
