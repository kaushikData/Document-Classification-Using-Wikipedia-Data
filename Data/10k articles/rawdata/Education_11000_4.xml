'''Academia Maria Reina''' is a Catholic middle (7th to 12th) and high school for girls in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]].

==Educative Mission==

Academia Maria Reina is a school of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Brentwood, New York. The educative mission of this congregation has its roots in the mission of Jesus: to evangelize, to heal, to pardon, to redeem and liberate all, through love that achieves union and reconciliation. During the year 2010-2011, the new 7th graders received the record of the most entries in the academy ever in school history. As they say in Academia Maria Reina: "Fuerza Conlleva Honor", which means "Strength Carries Honor". The Academia Maria Reina is one of the most prestigious schools for girls in Puerto Rico, where girls are educated by qualified teachers, who are paid an American salary scale above $ 25 per hour to $ 27 an hour.

==Philosophy==

Academia Maria Reina is a Catholic private middle school and high school. It is dedicated to the total development of its students, that aspire to continue university studies and doing so with authentically Christian values. The goal of the school is the growth of its students in the Catholic faith and the development of a critical mind. The final goal is to have students be agents of their own development and simultaneously be at the service of the community in which they live in order for this society be equal to all. Academia Maria Reina, conscientious of its philosophy, aspires to help develop a well rounded Puerto Rican woman of faith and devoted to her society; present in our reality, contributing with all her female dignity, occupying therefore the place that corresponds to her next to the man, so together they can build a better world. 

From 7-10 grades, the students will many electives as options and they choose one, some of these include dance, art, French, Italian, culinary arts (cooking), theater, creative writing, public speaking, and much more. The students of 11th will receive few electives and will choose two, and the 12th graders choose three electives. Starting in 10th grade, the students will get to learn from different AP courses such as calculus, world history, U.S. history, and more. In each grade in all of the school, the students are given different one-semester classes, such as, in 7th grade, the students pass or fail from Computer Science and English Literature. In 8th grade, the students exercise in Physical Education and Computer Application; in 9th grade, the students take Women Values and Sexuality with 'drafting'; in 10th grade the students once again have Physical Education and so on. Students also have an 8 day cycle schedule, once a cycle they have guidance class with the grade guidance counselor in which they discuss different things.

'''Anna Karen''' (born '''Ana Caren Krege''' on 19 September 1936) is a British [[film]], [[television]] and [[theatre actress]]. A regular in soaps and comedy, her best-known roles are in the sitcoms ''[[On the Buses]]'' and ''[[The Rag Trade]]''. She has also appeared in BBC TV's ''[[EastEnders]]'' from 1996 on a recurring basis as [[Aunt Sal]].

==Career==
Early in her career, Anna Karen worked as a [[striptease]] dancer at London's Panama Club. She has appeared in many films and television programmes, including the [[BBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Wild, Wild Women]]'', between 1968 and 1969. That same year she played a schoolgirl in the bikini-flying scene in the [[film]] ''[[Carry On Camping]]'' (even though she was 32 years old). In both these roles she acted with [[Barbara Windsor]] (herself a 31-year-old "schoolgirl" in the film).

Karen is best remembered for her role in the [[London Weekend Television|LWT]] sitcom ''[[On the Buses]]'' (1969–73). In this series, Karen played Olive, the dowdy bespectacled younger sister of Stan ([[Reg Varney]]), and wife of Arthur Rudge ([[Michael Robbins]]). She also appeared in the film spin-offs, ''[[On the Buses (film)|On the Buses]]'' (1971), ''[[Mutiny on the Buses]]'' (1972), and ''[[Holiday on the Buses]]'' (1973). From 1977 to 1978, Karen reprised the role of Olive in the LWT revival of the sitcom ''[[The Rag Trade]]'' created by the same writers.

Her other film credits included roles in ''[[The Sandwich Man (1966 film)|The Sandwich Man]]'' (1966), ''[[Poor Cow]]'' (1967), ''[[Carry On Loving]]'' (1970), ''[[What's Up Nurse!]]'' (1977) and ''[[Flick (2008 film)|Flick]]'' (2008). In 1996, Karen played a supporting role in the film ''[[Beautiful Thing (film)|Beautiful Thing]]'', as a neighbour of the main characters, Ste and Jamie. A year later, Karen reunited with Barbara Windsor, this time in the BBC [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]''. Karen plays [[Aunt Sal]], the sister of Windsor's [[Peggy Mitchell]]. Although Karen has never been a permanent cast member in the soap, she continues to appear as Aunt Sal occasionally, usually for only one or two episodes at a time.

In 2006, Anna Karen used her experience as a striptease dancer to act as a judge in the final edition of [[Channel 4]]'s [[reality television]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[Faking It (UK TV series)|Faking It]]''. In 2008, Karen was a guest on the Channel 4's ''[[Sunday Night Project]]'', again with Barbara Windsor.

Karen has also been a regular in [[pantomime]]s over the years, and played the [[Wicked Stepmother]] in ''[[Cinderella]]'' at the [[Millfield Theatre]], in [[Edmonton, London]] at Christmas 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.enfield.gov.uk/659/Our%20Enfield%20Dec%2008.pdf |publisher=''Our Enfield'' |title=Christmas pantos |page=34 |accessdate=2009-08-09 |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230121124/http://www.enfield.gov.uk/659/Our%20Enfield%20Dec%2008.pdf |archivedate=30 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life ==
Karen lives in [[Essex]], and was married to actor/comedian [[Terry Duggan]] from 1967 until his death in 2008. Their daughter, Gloria, was Duggan's adopted daughter from his previous marriage to Pat Lyons.&lt;ref name=Stage&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/obituaries/feature.php/21084/terry-duggan|title=Terry Duggan|first1=Patrick|last1=Newley|first2=Nigel|last2=Ellacott|publisher=''[[The Stage]]''|date=23 June 2008 | accessdate=2009-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onthebusesfanclub.co.uk/newpage46.html Fansite]&lt;/ref&gt; Karen teaches Drama at Brewers Academy, based in [[Hornchurch]], Essex.

In January 2016, Karen had a fall at her home in [[Ilford]] and was sofa-bound for eight weeks to recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nair|first1=Ajay|title=Ilford actress’ broken back agony: EastEnders’ Aunt Sal left to sleep on sofa|url=http://www.ilfordrecorder.co.uk/news/health/ilford-actress-broken-back-agony-eastenders-aunt-sal-left-to-sleep-on-sofa-1-4396565|website=Ilford Recorder|publisher=Archant Community Media Ltd|accessdate=5 February 2018|date=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She still filmed scenes for Peggy's death in ''[[EastEnders]]'' in March 2016 and again in May 2016, when the scenes were broadcast, Karen was seen with a walking frame. Karen was later pictured in a wheelchair filming Peggy's funeral scenes.

'''August Bournonville''' (21 August 1805 – 30 November 1879) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[ballet master]] and [[choreographer]]. He was the son of [[Antoine Bournonville]], a dancer and choreographer trained under the French choreographer, [[Jean Georges Noverre]], and the nephew of [[Julie Alix de la Fay]], née Bournonville, of the [[Royal Swedish Ballet]].

Bournonville was born in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, where his father had settled. He trained with his father [[Antoine Bournonville]] as well he studied under the [[Italy|Italian]] choreographer [[Vincenzo Galeotti]] at the [[Royal Danish Ballet]], Copenhagen, and in Paris, France, under French dancer [[Auguste Vestris]]. He initiated a unique style in ballet known as the [[Bournonville School]].

Following studies in Paris as a young man, Bournonville became solo dancer at the Royal Ballet in Copenhagen. From 1830 to 1848 he was choreographer for the [[Royal Danish Ballet]], for which he created more than 50 ballets admired for their exuberance, lightness and beauty. He created a style which, although influenced from the Paris ballet, is entirely his own. As a choreographer, he created a number of ballets with varied settings that range from Denmark to Italy, Russia to South America. A limited number of these works have survived.

Bournonville's work became known outside Denmark only after World War II. Since 1950, The Royal Ballet has several times made prolonged tours abroad, not the least to the United States, where they have performed his ballets.

Bournonville's best-known ballets are ''[[La Sylphide]]'' (1836), ''[[Napoli (ballet)|Napoli]]'' (1842), ''[[Le Conservatoire]]'' (1849), ''[[The Kermesse in Bruges]]'' (1851) and ''[[A Folk Tale (ballet)|A Folk Tale]]'' (1854).

==Early years==
Born in [[Copenhagen]] 21 August 1805, Bournonville was the son of the French ballet master [[Antoine Bournonville]], who had settled in [[Denmark]], and Lovisa Sundberg, a Swede. At the age of eight, he entered the Royal Ballet School at the Court Theatre in [[Christiansborg Palace]] under the tutelage of his father and [[Vincenzo Galeotti]], ballet master and principal choreographer of the [[Royal Danish Ballet]] from 1775 to 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, Walter. ''The King's Ballet Master: A Biography of Denmark's August Bournonville.'' New York: Dodd, Mead, &amp; Company, 1979. {{ISBN|0-396-07722-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 October 1813, Bournonville made his first stage appearance in a small part as the son of a Viking king in Galeotti's ''Lagertha'', the first ballet on a Nordic theme. Less than a year later, he received his first personal applause for dancing a Hungarian solo at the Court Theatre. In addition to dance, Bournonville was a voracious reader, learned French at home, played the violin, sang in a boy soprano voice, and studied declamation with the actors [[Michael Rosing]], Lindgreen, and Frydensdahl. His many talents were brought together on the Queen's birthday, 29 October 1817, when as a twelve-year-old he played the role of Adonia to royal acclaim in a music-drama, ''Solomon's Judgment'' and sang a romance, "The Mother with Her Drooping Wings".

==Family==

Bournonville had five siblings. He was the only one in out of the children who showed any interest in dancing. He married Helena Fredrika Håkansson on 23 June 1830. They had seven children, including [[Charlotte Bournonville|Charlotte]] who became an opera singer and actress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=18016|title=Charlotte H F Bournonville|publisher=Svenskt biografiskt lexikon|accessdate=10 June 2017 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both sons died as toddlers.

==Paris==

In 1820, Antoine Bournonville received a grant from his sovereign to briefly study ballet in Paris. Bournonville accompanied his father to Paris, and, although he studied solely with his father during the Paris sojourn, he was exposed to the latest trends in ballet and watched the illustrious teachers, [[Pierre Gardel|Gardel]] and [[Auguste Vestris|Vestris]] in action. Upon returning to Denmark, Bournonville became a member of the Royal Theatre, dancing in repertory that was less interesting to him after his exposure to Paris ballet.

In the spring of 1824, Bournonville returned to Paris for final studies and examination preparations at the [[Paris Opera Ballet|Paris Opera]]. The expected fifteen-month sojourn would stretch to five years, during which time Danish ballet would approach near-disastrous decline. In Paris, Bournonville met his father's old friend, Louis Nivelon, who provided him with friendship, meals, and entree into society. Bournonville hoped the master Gardel would accept him but Gardel's studio was no longer in existence and he was directed to Auguste Vestris for training in his weakest areas — "balance, pirouettes, and arms."  Vestris accepted Bournonville. Bournonville wrote his father: {{cquote |I am extremely satisfied with my Mr. Vestris and what is more, he is very pleased with my zeal, diligence, and my instant willingness. He is very exact about the lessons and comes to class three times a week at eight in the morning and three times a week at nine and remains until eleven. I get up every morning at six and always arrive one half hour before the lesson so that I am absolutely prepared when Vestris arrives. He has taken me in friendship and cultivated my talent with extreme care, he rigorously points out my faults but treats me with consideration.}}

Bournonville danced from 1820 to 1828 with the noted dancer Marie Taglioni and the Paris Opera Ballet.

==Death==

Bournonville stopped teaching adult classes in the spring of 1877. On returning from church on 30 November 1879, he was stricken and taken to a hospital. Bournonville was interred near Asminderød Church near Fredensborg.

==Legacy==

Bournonville's work remains an important link with earlier traditions. He  resisted many of the excesses of the romantic era ballets in his work. He is noted for his egalitarian choreography, which gave equal emphasis to both male and female roles, at a time when European ballet emphasized the ballerina. Many of his contemporaries explored the extremes of human emotion, while Bournonville, using enthusiastic footwork and fluid phrases in his work, portrayed a more balanced human nature.

Neither Banana Pi nor Shenzhen SINOVOIP Co.,Ltd. have a direct relationship to the [[Raspberry Pi Foundation]], though its similarities are clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.techrepublic.com/pictures/raspberry-pi-five-alternative-boards-for-hackers-and-modders/5/ |title=Raspberry Pi: Five alternatives for hackers and modders |newspaper=TechRepublic |last=Heath |first=Nick |date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Linux User &amp; Developer" does not consider it a "direct clone, but a considerable evolution," whilst linux.com similarly sees it as a clone with improved performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/reviews/banana-pi-review-tastier-than-raspberry |title=Banana Pi review – tastier than Raspberry? |website=Linux User &amp; Developer |first=Gareth |last=Halfacree}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.linux.com/news/embedded-mobile/mobile-linux/771048-raspberry-pi-clones-match-the-connectors-but-boost-the-firepower |title=Raspberry Pi Clones Match the Connectors, But Boost the Firepower |first=Eric |last=Brown |newspaper=Linux News |date=24 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The board layout is very similar to the Raspberry Pi board, though it's about 10% larger and the relative spacing of some connectors varies. Not all Raspberry Pi accessories will fit as a result.

The '''Banana Pi Pro''' is a credit card-sized and low-power [[single-board computer]] developed in China by the LeMaker Team, with the goal of promoting STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education in schools.

Like its smaller sibling the Banana Pi, the Pro concept is heavily influenced by the Raspberry Pi, however the Banana Pro provides various enhancements over prior designs.

The Banana Pro has an Allwinner A20 system on a chip (SoC), which includes an [[ARM Cortex-A7 MPCore|ARM Cortex-A7]] Dual-core ([[ARMv7|ARMv7-A]]) 1&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|GHz]], [[Mali (GPU)|Mali]]-400 MP2 GPU and 1[[Gigabyte|GB]] [[DDR3 SDRAM]].

The Banana Pro uses a microSD card for booting an OS, but also includes a SATA 2.0 interface to allow connection of a hard disk for additional storage, however you cannot boot from the hard disk.

Other differences from the Banana Pi include on-board Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n AP6181, integrated composite video and audio output into a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm TRRS jack. This makes space for a 40-pin extension header.

'''The Centre for India &amp; Global Business''' ('''CIGB''') was launched in March 2009 as part of [[Cambridge Judge Business School]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], [[England]], to support the university’s growing engagement with India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge-india.org/ Cambridge-India Partnership].&lt;/ref&gt;  As a research centre and an engagement platform CIGB is dedicated to the study of India's rapidly expanding role in the global [[knowledge economy]].

==History==
CIGB was established with initial funding from the [[BP]] foundation. The academic director of CIGB is [[Jaideep Prabhu|Professor Jaideep Prabhu]], the first [[University of Cambridge|Jawaharlal Nehru Professor of Indian Business and Enterprise]] at the University of Cambridge, who took up the post in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2008050202 Appointment of the first Jawaharlal Nehru Professor at Cambridge], press release from Cambridge University&lt;/ref&gt; The founding Executive Director of CIGB was [[Navi Radjou]], who served between January 2009 and June 2011. The Centre has 14 other academic members, including [[Cambridge Judge Business School]] faculty and PhD students.

==Research activities==
CIGB conducts research in collaboration with a global network of academic partners around three complementary themes:
*''India as a global innovation hub'': how and why firms from around the world are increasingly locating their global R&amp;D and innovation activities in India
*''Indian firms going global'': how Indian firms are going global on the back of innovation in India or in order to become more innovative relative to global competitors
*''Co-innovation with the'' [[bottom of the pyramid|''bottom of the socio-economic pyramid'']] (mass markets): how multinational and Indian firms are engaging those who live on less than $5 a day as value-adding partners through innovative products, services and business models.
A major issue underlying these three themes is how India is emerging as a learning laboratory for affordable and sustainable innovation to deal with the global challenges of scarcity and diversity.

The academic projects undertaken by CIGB involve field research in India which CIGB-related faculty visit frequently in order to collect data and conduct interviews with local policy-makers, entrepreneurs, and corporate executives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge-india.org/visits/|title=Cambridge-India Activity: : University of Cambridge: Cambridge and India|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=October 11, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831222345/http://www.cambridge-india.org/visits/|archivedate=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CIGB produces case studies that feed into its outreach and networks activities. Its research has been featured in leading newspapers and magazines worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i-cio.com/blog/july-2010/polycentric-innovation The New Shape of Innovation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725141517/http://www.i-cio.com/blog/july-2010/polycentric-innovation |date=July 25, 2010 }}, Global Intelligence for the CIO, 19 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outreach and networks==
CIGB also hosts conferences and seminars that bring together academics, corporate leaders, and policy-makers from all over the world to discuss and disseminate latest research findings as well as policy and industry best practices. These events are hosted both in Cambridge as well as in major Indian cities. For instance, in March 2009, Professor Jaideep Prabhu, Director of CIGB, delivered his inaugural lecture in [[New Delhi]], which was chaired by Mr [[Montek Singh Ahluwalia]], Deputy Chairman of the Indian Planning Commission. In May 2009, CIGB hosted in [[Cambridge]] a major conference titled “''Innovation in India and China: How to Create Value from Emerging Markets'',” which explored the rise of [[India]] and [[China]] as both fast-growing global markets and world-class sources of innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/dp/2009050105|title=Latest news|work=University of Cambridge|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india.jbs.cam.ac.uk/news/events/2009/090518_innovation/index.html Proceedings from the “Innovation in India and China” conference], CIGB website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, CIGB has also hosted a number of speakers including: [[Nandan Nilekani]], Chairman of the new [[Unique Identification Authority of India]] (UIDAI) and former Co-Chairman of [[Infosys Technologies]] (April 2009); former Indian president [[A.P.J. Abdul Kalam|Dr A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]](June 2009);&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge-India Partnership, Cambridge-India Activitiy, September 2008 onwards, University of Cambridge [http://www.india.jbs.cam.ac.uk/news/events/2009/090603_abdul_kalam.html Creative Leadership in the Global Knowledge Economy], Dr Abdul Kalam’s lecture at Judge Business School, 9 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ravi Kant (Indian executive)|Ravi Kant]], Vice-Chairman of [[Tata Motors]]; and Dr [[Ramesh Mashelkar]], former Director General of the [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]], who delivered the inaugural BP Annual Lecture at Cambridge Judge Business Business on 21 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india.jbs.cam.ac.uk/news/events/2010/100621_mashelkar.html Visit of Dr R.A. Mashelkar to Cambridge], CIGB website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online engagement==
In November 2009, at the [[World Economic Forum]]’s India Economic Summit, CIGB launched Indovations.Net, an interactive, multimedia website that educates users worldwide about innovations in India across five domains: business, social, energy/environment, art/culture, and science &amp; technology. This website addresses a fundamental questions such as, What can the world learn from India-inspired innovation — or [[Indovation]] — and how people can benefit from it, etc.

Prof Jaideep Prabhu and Navi Radjou write [[blog]] posts on innovation, [[emerging markets]], and global leadership on the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/search/radjou%25252520prabhu/ Blog posts by Prof Jaideep Prabhu and Navi Radjou], [http://hbr.org/ HBR.org].&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''community college district''' is type of [[special-purpose district]] in some [[U.S. state]]s.  Each district consists of part of a state and operates the public [[community college]] system in its district.

Some states, like Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin, do not have community college districts.  Instead, the community colleges there are administered by state-administered college systems like the [[West Virginia Community and Technical College System]] and the [[Wisconsin Technical College System]].  In some other states, [[County (United States)|counties]] or groups of counties operate community colleges. For example, [[Maryland]] has a board of community college trustees in each [[List of counties in Maryland|county]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmStatutesText.aspx?article=ged&amp;section=16-101&amp;ext=html&amp;session=2016RS&amp;tab=subject5 Maryland Code, Education Article, § 16-101]&lt;/ref&gt; or, for counties that have formed a multi-county region to operate community colleges, region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmStatutesText.aspx?article=ged&amp;section=16-202&amp;ext=html&amp;session=2016RS&amp;tab=subject5 Maryland Code, Education Article, § 16-202]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined in a 2006 study&lt;ref name="Eliminating"&gt;{{cite journal|citeseerx = 10.1.1.120.5440|title=Eliminating the successor to plagiarism? Identifying the usage of contract cheating sites|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2006-06-19|accessdate=&lt;!-- 2007-05-23 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Thomas Lancaster&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcu.ac.uk/computing/staff-tl.html Thomas Lancaster bio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206154603/http://www.bcu.ac.uk/computing/staff-tl.html |date=2009-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Clarke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/robert-clarke/16/12a/967 |title=Robert Clarke bio |publisher=Linkedin.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Birmingham City University|the University of Central England in Birmingham]] (now known as ''Birmingham City University'').

==Extent==

The first published material detailing the extent of contract cheating is a study by Robert Clarke and Thomas Lancaster.&lt;ref name="Eliminating" /&gt; The study presented three main findings:

#Over 12 percent of postings on a popular website for outsourcing computer contract work are actually bid requests from students looking to attempt contract cheating.
#Contract cheaters posted an average of 4–7 requests, suggesting that habitual use is made of such services by these students.
#A smaller number of users have posted over 50 bid requests, including examples from multiple institutions. This suggests that these are agencies subcontracting work, not students who are directly making use of the services.

Whereas the quality of solutions to assignments sold by [[essay mill]] has been questioned, a study by Jenkins and Helmore showed that work obtained through the use of an [[Online auction|auction site]] was of sufficient quality to gain good marks and remain undetected by the module [[tutor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ics.heacademy.ac.uk/Events/HEADublin2006_V2/papers/Tony%20Jenkins%2023.pdf |format=PDF|title=T. Jenkins and S. Helmore "Coursework for cash: the threat from on-line plagiarism", in Proceedings of 7th Annual Conference for Information and Computer Science, Dublin. Higher Education Academy pp121-126 (August 2006)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study examined over 900 examples of contract cheating by students studying computing subjects. The published results categorise the assignment types (e.g. Programming, Database, Web Design) and are analysed by country. One new concern identified by this study was the number of major projects (both final year undergraduate and postgraduate) being posted onto auction sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ics.heacademy.ac.uk/events/8th-annual-conf/Papers/Thomas%20Lancaster%20final.pdf|title=Assessing Contract Cheating Through Auction Sites – A Computing Perspective|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2007-08-30|accessdate=2007-09-13 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a study of 4,000 suspected cases of "contract cheating" some interesting patterns of behaviour have been observed. A summary was presented at the HEA Workshop on Contract Cheating (March 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ics.heacademy.ac.uk/events/presentations/682_Private%20Life%20Annotated.pdf|title=The Private Life of an Assignment|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2008-03-07|accessdate=2011-01-09 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Aske conference held in June 2009 a paper detailing a "multi-faceted" approach to dealing with the problem of "contract cheating" was presented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.brookes.ac.uk/aske/documents/Plagiarism09_LancasterClarke.pdf|format=PDF|title=Contract Cheating in UK Higher Education: promoting a proactive approach|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2009-06-04|accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper presented at the STEM conference (April 2012) was a study of over 600 assignments in subject areas ranging from "Anthropology to Theology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/documents/stem-conference/Computing%201/Thomas_Lancaster_Robert_Clarke.pdf|title=Dealing with contract cheating: a question of attribution|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2012-04-18|accessdate=2012-05-03 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commercial Aspects of Contract Cheating are examined in a paper given at ITiCSE '13. This paper analyses the monetary value of contract cheating to the different parties who play a role in the contract cheating process. The main analysis is based on a corpus consisting of 14,438 identified attempts to cheat. The corpus was collected between March 2005 and July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2462497|title=Commercial aspects of contract cheating|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2013-07-01|accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.slideshare.net/ThomasLancaster/commercial-aspects-of-contract-cheating-iticse-2013|title=Commercial aspects of contract cheating (Slides)|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke |first2=Thomas|last2=Lancaster|date=2013-07-01|accessdate=2013-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 meta-analysis of 5 studies, 3.5% of a total of 1378 students reported buying assignments to submit as their own. Of the students who reported engaging in contract cheating, more than 60% admitted doing so more than once.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Guy J.|last2=Clare|first2=Joseph|date=2017-04-20|title=How Prevalent is Contract Cheating and to What Extent are Students Repeat Offenders?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10805-017-9278-x|journal=Journal of Academic Ethics|language=en|pages=1–10|doi=10.1007/s10805-017-9278-x|issn=1570-1727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
The assignments prepared by essay-writing companies and other paid third-parties are supposedly 'original', meaning that they are likely to evade detection by software packages such as Turnitin. Assessment design strategies may limit the possibility that students can use contract cheating services, although a 2014 publication in Educational Studies showed that reducing the time that students have to prepare their assessments is unlikely to deter contract cheating, and that there appeared to be significant spare capacity in the contract cheating market.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, M.J. and Newton P.M. 2014. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03055698.2014.889597#.VDj7k1fbGw0 Turnaround time and market capacity in contract cheating]. Educational Studies. 40(2) 233-236.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Detection ==
In July 2007 a paper proposed a systematic six-stage process that tutors can use to detect students who are contract cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4365466|title=Establishing a Systematic Six-Stage Process for Detecting Contract Cheating|last2=Lancaster|first2=Thomas|date=2007-07-26|website=|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke|accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contract cheating sites often claim this form of cheating is undetectable,&lt;ref name="Lines 889–914"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lines|first=Lisa|date=2016-11-16|title=Ghostwriters guaranteeing grades? The quality of online ghostwriting services available to tertiary students in Australia|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13562517.2016.1198759|journal=Teaching in Higher Education|volume=21|issue=8|pages=889–914|doi=10.1080/13562517.2016.1198759|issn=1356-2517}}&lt;/ref&gt; a claim that has been tested in two studies. In a 2016 Australian study, when markers were asked to mark a set of contract cheating assignments and contract cheating was not mentioned to them, no marker raised any concerns of contract cheating.&lt;ref name="Lines 889–914"/&gt; However, in a later study when markers were specifically asked to detect it, they correctly identified contract cheating 62% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dawson|first=Phillip|last2=Sutherland-Smith|first2=Wendy|date=2017-06-05|title=Can markers detect contract cheating? Results from a pilot study|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02602938.2017.1336746|journal=Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–8|doi=10.1080/02602938.2017.1336746|issn=0260-2938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has recently been proposed that existing assignment and invigilated assessment data can be systematically analyzed in order to detect patterns of students' performance that may be indicative of contract cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clare|first=Joseph|last2=Walker|first2=Sonia|last3=Hobson|first3=Julia|date=2017-08-08|title=Can we detect contract cheating using existing assessment data? Applying crime prevention theory to an academic integrity issue|url=https://edintegrity.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-017-0015-4|journal=International Journal for Educational Integrity|language=En|volume=13|issue=1|pages=4|doi=10.1007/s40979-017-0015-4|issn=1833-2595}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, at the Plagiarism across Europe and Beyond conference, it was demonstrated how collecting analytical data at the time of writing can help in identifying cases where a student committed contract cheating. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= https://plagiarism.pefka.mendelu.cz/files/proceedings_15.pdf |title=Plagiarism detection 2.0: Detection of Contract Cheating |last1=Khan |first1=Wasi |year=2015|publisher= Mendel University|book-title= |pages=215|location=Brno |conference= Plagiarism Across Europe and Beyond }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| people = Khan, Wasi (Presenter)| date = Aug 3, 2015| title = Plagiarism Across Europe and Beyond| medium = Motion picture| language = English | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14f5AnfTy0A | access-date = November 12, 2017| location = Brno, Czech Republic | publisher = Plagiarism Across Europe and Beyond
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although non-originality engines (like [[Turnitin]]) are unlikely to detect contract cheating, there has been some success in using them to identify the source of assignments detected on auction sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/resources/detail/stem-conference-2014/Post_event_resources/Computing/Using_Turnitin|title=Using Turnitin as a tool for attribution in cases of contract cheating|last2=Lancaster|first2=Thomas|date=2014-04-13|first1=Robert|last1=Clarke|accessdate=2014-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Penalties==
In general, academic institutions consider contract cheating to be one of the most serious forms of academic misconduct and it is penalised accordingly. In 2010 the 'AMBeR Project' developed a UK 'Plagiarism Tariff' in an attempt to standardise penalties for all forms of academic misconduct. The final report noted that purchase of an assignment should be penalised with the most serious penalties available, such as expulsion from the institution, and that many institutions considered it to be a separate form of misconduct altogether due to the seemingly obvious intent associated with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/plagiarism-tariff-let-the-punishment-fit-the-demerit-points/412088.article|title=Plagiarism tariff: let the punishment fit the demerit points|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2015 research study, also in the UK, asked university students what they thought penalties for academic misconduct should be. The responses demonstrated that students consistently recommended lenient penalties for plagiarism, and that this effect was most pronounced for contract cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa20205|title=Academic integrity: a quantitative study of confidence and understanding in students at the start of their higher education|publisher=|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/hundreds-fail-to-spot-plagiarism/2019818.article|title=Hundreds fail to spot plagiarism|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02602938.2015.1024199#.VccNJvma5kU|title= Academic integrity: a quantitative study of confidence and understanding in students at the start of their higher education|accessdate=22 May 2016 | doi=10.1080/02602938.2015.1024199|volume=41|journal=Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education|pages=482–497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
The legality of contract cheating services was reviewed by Newton and Lang in a 2016 book chapter of the Springer Handbook for Academic Integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_38|title=Handbook of Academic Integrity|first1=Philip M.|last1=Newton|first2=Christopher|last2=Lang|editor-first=Tracey|editor-last=Bretag|date=1 January 2016|publisher=Springer Singapore|pages=249–271|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/978-981-287-098-8_38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal status of these services varies internationally. In [[New Zealand]] it is illegal to "advertise or provide third party assistance to cheat", with similar, older laws on the statutes of 17 states in the US. 

In the United Kingdom, the Quality Assurance Agency published a report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/newsroom/education-deterrence-detection-how-to-tackle-the-problem-of-essay-mills|title=Education, deterrence, detection: how to tackle the problem of essay mills|date=2016-08-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919071215/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/newsroom/education-deterrence-detection-how-to-tackle-the-problem-of-essay-mills|archivedate=19 September 2016|work=QAA news}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocating the use of a legal approach as one way to tackle contract cheating, and suggesting that existing fraud laws might be used, since the activities of such services, and their clients, could be reasonably interpreted to fit with definitions of fraud as they involve 'false representation' and 'failure to disclose information'. A subsequent research project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://edintegrity.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-017-0014-5|title=Are Essay Mills committing fraud? An analysis of their behaviours vs the 2006 Fraud Act (UK)|publisher=|journal=International Journal for Educational Integrity|volume=13|issue=1|pages=3|doi=10.1007/s40979-017-0014-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared the UK Fraud laws with the terms and conditions used by contract cheating services and concluded that they would be unlikely to fall foul of [[Fraud]] law due to the disclaimers, terms and conditions they use which generally state that any custom written products are to be used only as 'study guides' or 'revision aids', thereby placing responsibility, and 'intent', onto the student client. Despite this,  media 'stings' have shown that companies can be complicit in the inappropriate use of these products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/article1422913.ece|title=‘£630 and I’ll put you on the way to a first’|date=15 June 2014|author1=Robin Henry|author2=Cal Flyn|author3=Katie Glass|publisher=The Sunday Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar analysis in [[Lithuania]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://edintegrity.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-017-0020-7|title=Ethical and legal observations on contract cheating services as an agreement|publisher=|journal=International Journal for Educational Integrity|volume=13|issue=1|pages=9|doi=10.1007/s40979-017-0020-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that contract cheating services were unlikely to fall foul of existing laws, although an analysis of [[Australian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1037969X17710627|title=Contract cheating: Will students pay for serious criminal consequences?|date=18 September 2017|publisher=|journal=Alternative Law Journal|volume=42|issue=2|pages=123–129|doi=10.1177/1037969x17710627}}&lt;/ref&gt; law concluded that fraud, as well as forgery and conspiracy, might be legal avenues via which contract cheating could be targeted. All three studies called for the introduction of new legal approaches to tackle contract cheating.

A follow-up research study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://edintegrity.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40979-017-0022-5|title=A legal approach to tackling contract cheating?|publisher=|journal=International Journal for Educational Integrity|volume=13|issue=1|pages=11|doi=10.1007/s40979-017-0022-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed such a new law, based on the principle of [[strict liability]], which lessens the requirement for prosecutors to demonstrate that they 'intended to help student cheat', but instead would make them liable for prosecution simply for offering services that could be reasonably interpreted as being used for contract cheating.  

More broadly, despite the apparent potential of a legal challenge to contract cheating companies, prosecutions are currently rare, largely due to the limitations of existing laws. In addition, the simple act of outlawing a service would not necessarily reduce demand for it; the aforementioned research studies all call for a holistic, multi-pronged approach to tackling contract cheating.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11671">'''Enric Ucelay-Da Cal''' (born 1948 in [[New York City]], United States) is a historian specializing in [[contemporary history]], who has done extensive work on [[Catalan history]]. He is at present (2014) Senior [[Professor Emeritus]] at the [[Pompeu Fabra University]] (UPF) in Barcelona and coordinator of a Research Group on States, Nations and Sovereignties, linked to the UPF.

==Early life and education==
He is the son of Spanish exiles from the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936-1939. Between 1965 and 1969 he studied at [[Bard College]] in New York City (now Bard University), graduated with a BA in 1969 and was awarded a [[Woodrow Wilson Scholarship]]. Accepted at the Graduate School of the [[University of Columbia]] in New York City, he studied with [[Arno Mayer]] and [[Robert O. Paxton]] (with whom he worked briefly as "research assistant "). He completed his Ph.D. in 1979 with a dissertation titled ''Catalan State : Strategies of Separation of Catalan Radical Nationalism and Revolution (1919-1933)'' ( [[Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]], United States: [[University Microfilms International]]), a thesis initially directed by Paxton and then by the scholar on Spanish politics [[Edward Malefakis]]. This thesis was largely based on systematic interviewing, and the location of Catalan printed materials, as much of the archival sources were still inaccessible in the 1970s.

In 1972 he moved to Spain to research his dissertation. He was soon offered an instructorship at the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] (UAB), beginning in 1974. As Spanish legislation required citizenship for tenure status, Ucelay-Da Cal somewhat disingenuously maintained his situation as professor by obtaining a degree in Contemporary (i.e. Modern) History at the [[University of Barcelona]] in 1980 and, in 1983, a doctorate in history at the UAB with a new thesis, written in Catalan, re-researched and with a slight change of temporal focus, ''El nacionalisme radical català i la resistència a la Dictadura de Primo de Rivera, 1923-1931'', directed by [[Josep Fontana]]. To document this new text, Ucelay-Da Cal worked in numerous archives of France, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, [[Portugal]] and of course, Spain, which, because of standard time access clauses (usually fifty years), were previously closed to investigators working on the 1920s. The [[documentary research]] did not produce significant changes in the narrative previously established by oral and press sources.  In 1983 he obtained Spanish citizenship, and was granted tenure.

==University teaching==
Accordingly, between 1983 and 1995, Ucelay-Da Cal was tenured “Titular Professor” of [[Contemporary history]] at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. After the corresponding “opposition” or public contest for promotion characteristic of the Spanish University system, he became [[Senior Professor]] (“catedrático”) of contemporary history at the same university from 1995 to 2006. Since 2006, he has been senior professor of contemporary history at the [[Pompeu Fabra University]], also in [[Barcelona]]. From 2009 to 2013 he participated in the Advanced Grant Project from the European Research Council (ERC) ''State Building in Latin America'', at the UPF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sgbl.upf.edu/ ''State Building in Latin America'']&lt;/ref&gt; Although he has not been particularly active in teaching abroad, he was  “visiting professor " at [[Duke University]] between February and April 1994, taught also at [[Venice International University]] (Italy)  in the spring semester of 2002, and received as " visiting scholar " at the [[School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences]] (École des Hautes Etudes de Sciences Sociales) in Paris in April 2004.

He directed the dissertations of historians, some whom have since gone on to very distinguished investigatory careers: as examples, one can cite [[Xavier Casals]], who has become unquestionably the major specialist in [[Neo-Nazism]] in Spain; [[David Martinez Fiol]], who pioneered research on the impact of the [[First World War]] in [[Catalonia]]; {{ill|Joan Maria Thomàs|es}}, a top specialist on the Spanish [[Falange]] movement; and [[Joan Esculies]], a rising figure among scholars of [[Catalan nationalism]]; among others. He has been open to work with researchers younger than himself. For many years, he collaborated closely with {{ill|Francisco Veiga|es}}, the main Spanish researcher on [[Eastern Europe]]. More recently, he has also prepared books and projects on politically controversial topics in Catalan history together with [[Arnau Gonzàlez i Vilalta]], a younger Catalan historian specializing in the diplomatic contacts of [[Catalan nationalism]].

==Historical Work==
Ucelay-Da Cal has focused on his career production on the contemporary history of Spain and [[Catalonia]], [[Spanish nationalism]] and Catalan nationalism, as well as specific issues such as the role of [[Catalan independence]] (the [[Estat Català]] movement, in particular) before and during the [[Second Spanish Republic]], as well as during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In broader terms, he has called for greater attention to regional dynamics in the explanation of 'national' history. He has insisted on themes such as the analysis of [[populism]] in Spain&lt;ref&gt;Vid. his article [https://www.scribd.com/doc/23817009/Enric-Ucelay-Da-Cal-El-Pueblo-Contra-La-Clase "El pueblo contra la clase: populismo legitimador, revoluciones y sustituciones políticas en Cataluña (1936-1939)"] in ''Ayer'', num. 50, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and its connections or analogies with [[Latin America]]. As regards the Spanish Civil War, he has called the use of the [[anthropology]] of religion as a means to interpret many trends considered usually as exclusively “political”. He has evinced a strong skepticism regarding many of the suppositions that govern the leading interpretations in contemporary Spanish history.

==Publications==
Enric Ucelay-Da Cal has published over two hundred articles in academic journals and other history serial publications, as well as in books in Spanish, Catalan, English, French, and Italian. He also reviewed books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revistadelibros.com/criticos2.php?e=3104&amp;c=a9e6fee661dd1121fd472290eecf4d03 Reviews] by Enric Ucelay-Da Cal in ''Revista de Libros''&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his work is available in pdf format on his personal webpage.

'''Fletcher G. Watson''' (c. 1912 – 7 May 1997) was an [[United States|American]] professor of [[science education]] at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Education]] (1946–77), where he served as the [[Henry Lee Shattuck]] Professor of Education (1966–77). Watson was a founder and co-director of [[Harvard Project Physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aas.org/obituaries/fletcher-g-watson-1912-1997 |title=Fletcher G.

==Early life and education==
Fletcher Guard Watson was born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] in 1912. He graduated in [[astronomy]] at [[Pomona College]] in 1933 and earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in astronomy in 1938 at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1997/05.15/FletcherWatsonA.html |title=Fletcher Watson, Astronomer, Science Educator Dies at 85 |date=May 15, 1997 |website=news.harvard.edu |publisher=Harvard University Gazette |access-date=July 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Following his Ph.D., Watson joined the [[Harvard College Observatory]], researching meteors, meteorites, and solar observation. During [[World War II]], Watson served in the [[U.S. Navy|Navy]], where he worked on the Long Range Navigation ([[LORAN]]) system. He left the navy in 1946 with the rank of [[lieutenant commander]]. [[Harvard University]] president [[James Bryant Conant]] appointed Watson a professor of science education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where he served from 1946 until 1977. He was named Harvard's first Henry Lee Shattuck Professor of Education in 1966.&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt;

In 1964, Watson founded and was co-director of Harvard Project Physics, a nationwide effort to develop high school physics courses that would attract more students, particularly females. One aspect of the program that he researched was testing the course materials in schools to find out if they were having the desired result of increasing interest and enrollment in science courses.&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt;

Watson retired from Harvard in 1977, and served as director of Project City Sciences  at [[New York University]]. This program focused on training teachers and other professionals for work in inner-city schools. He served as a member of the planetarium advisory committee of the [[Boston Museum of Science]], and was the committee's first chairman.&lt;ref name="Harvard"/&gt;

'''Frank B. Ebersole''' (1919–2009) was an [[American philosopher]] who developed a unique form of [[ordinary language philosophy]].

==Biography==
Frank B. Ebersole was born in Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/theworldlink/Obituaries.asp?Page=LifeStory&amp;PersonId=124577044 Death announcement]&lt;/ref&gt; He majored in zoology at Heidelberg College. After years as a philosophy graduate student at Yale University, he transferred to the University of Chicago, where he worked with [[Rudolf Carnap]], one of the founders of logical analysis, and with [[Charles Hartshorne]], an advocate of process philosophy and a theorist of physiological psychology. Ebersole received his Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Chicago in 1947 (He also  won the 1945 Fiske Poetry Prize). 
His dissertation was entitled "Biology and the theory of knowledge : an analytical method for the theory of knowledge, and its relation to biological laws." The thesis contains 7 chapters: 
I. Determination of the subject and Method
II. Relations of Truth and Knowledge: Logic and Epistemology
III. The Order of Knowledge and the Phenomenally Given
IV. Causal Deliverances in the Given, and the Memory Premiss
V. Analysis and the A Priori
VI. Special Problems Concerning Memory; Polemic
and; VII. Summary of the Main Argument. 
The thesis starts with general discussion of theory of knowledge (epistemology) and how knowledge must be founded in the "phenomenally given" on page 48 it states, "Here we have if anywhere the foundation of the order of knowledge, in knowledge of the phenomenally given." From that point, Ebersole goes on to examine memory in Ch. IV and the relationship of Biology to questions in theory of knowledge. Ending with problems of memory concerning other areas of philosophy and science. Ebersole later directly challenges these ideas concerning memory and the "phenomenally given" in his book, "Things We Know." 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ebersole |first1=Frank |title=Biology and the theory of knowledge : an analytical method for the theory of knowledge, and its relation to biological laws. |date=1947 |publisher=University of Chicago |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=1522381 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/4112041&lt;/ref&gt;

Ebersole taught philosophy at colleges and universities, including Carleton, Oberlin, San Jose State, Stanford, and Alberta, but most of his academic career was at the [[University of Oregon]], where he was department chairman and director of graduate studies. He published essays in a number of journals, however, many of his essays were not accepted for journal publication and are available only in his three self-published books: ''Things We Know'', ''Meaning and Saying'', and ''Language and Perception''.&lt;ref&gt;''Things We Know'' (Eugene, Ore: University of Oregon Books, 1967; 2nd edition, Xlibris , 2001). ''Language and Perception'' (Washington, D.C.: University Press of America, 1979; 2nd edition, Xlibris, 2002). ''Meaning and Saying'' (Washington, D.C.: University Press of America, 1979; 2nd edition, Xlibris, 2002).{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides his involvement with philosophical issues, he was a photographer, and author of two books of poetry (''Many Times of Year'' and ''Song of the Crow''&lt;ref&gt;''Song of the Crow'' (Columbia City, Indiana: Overdeer Press, 1992) and ''Many Times of Year'' (Friendsville, Maryland: Acheron Press, 1984). Some of the poems are about philosophy but most are about other subjects.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Philosophy==
Initially Ebersole was interested in philosophers who brought a zoological perspective to their philosophy ([[Henri Bergson]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and Charles Hartshorne, for example). He also was influenced by ideas of logical analysis (especially as practised by his teacher Rudolf Carnap). In the early 1950s he read [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s ''Blue Book'' and ''Philosophical Investigations'', and this changed his direction considerably:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

Like many another I was once committed to a certain type of philosophical endeavor—a type that goes under the names of "linguistic analysis" or "[[philosophical analysis|conceptual analysis]]".... Then I read Wittgenstein. My first reaction was to add footnotes to the things I had been writing. Then I added appendices. Finally I tore the things up; and I have been trying in various ways ever since to overcome a state of paralysis, without success.&lt;ref&gt;From "Saying and Meaning", chap. 4, ''Meaning and Saying''. The essay is a revised version of an essay originally published in ''Ludwig Wittgenstein: Philosophy and Language'', eds. Alice Ambrose and Morris Lazerowitz (George Allen and Unwin, London and Humanities Press, New York, 1972), pp. 186–221.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
By the later 1950s Ebersole found a new way in philosophy, partly stimulated by the thinking of Wittgenstein and the writings of other early ordinary language philosophers. In 1957 he read his first paper based on his new thinking; it was about [[dream argument|Descartes' dream argument]].&lt;ref&gt;The paper was subsequently published in ''Mind'' in July 1959 with the Latin title, "De Somniis". A revised version, now titled "The Objects of Perceptions and Dreams", is Essay 5 in ''Things We Know''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Ebersole's work from his mature period (available in his three books) "requires—and often succeeds in producing—a radical reorientation of one's thinking".&lt;ref&gt;David Tiktin in his review of the first editions of two of Ebersole's books in the journal, ''Philosophical Investigations'', Spring 1980, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Ebersole's essays give form to his personal struggles with philosophical problems. In most of the essays he attempts to remove crustations from traditional philosophical ideas so that he can identify and address the central issues underlying a philosophical problem from his own personal point of view. Often he contrasts the philosophical conception of words that are central to a philosophical problem with examples of how these same words are used in the context of ordinary (non-philosophical) discourse. Using examples, he reveals significant differences between the ways we think when we are in the grip of a philosophical problem and when we are not so gripped. Ebersole concludes that philosophical problems often arise from philosophers' tendency to think in terms of philosophy.

He has written mainly on topics in epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of language. Ebersole is generally taken to be part of the school of ordinary language philosophy and he argues in several essays that two main critics of ordinary language philosophy ([[Paul Grice]]&lt;ref&gt;Grice's objection is discussed in ''Language and Perception'', chap. 4, "The Causal Theory of Perception".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John R. Searle]]&lt;ref&gt;Searle's objection is taken up in chaps. 3, 4, and 5 of ''Meaning and Saying''.&lt;/ref&gt;) pose questions raised by the robust form of ordinary language philosophy he practiced. For an appraisal of Ebersole's work, see Don S. Levi's paper ''Ebersole's Philosophical Treasure Hunt.''&lt;ref&gt;"Ebersole's Philosophical Treasure Hunt", in ''Philosophy'', vol. 79, April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; His writing is unconventional in style and content, as he acknowledges in this excerpt from one of his poems:

"People stopped and puzzled when I talked, &lt;br&gt;
wondered what to make of &lt;br&gt;
anything I said. &lt;br&gt;
And if I made them ask themselves &lt;br&gt;
What of heads or tails to make &lt;br&gt;
of a philosopher's talking, &lt;br&gt;
that was a good thing I did,&lt;br&gt;
I would say.&lt;br&gt;
Yes, I would say that."&lt;ref&gt;From the poem, "Conversation with a Dead Philosopher", in ''Many Times of Year'', pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Global education''' is a set of ideas taught to enhance one's perception of the world. It is taught within the curriculum where teachers integrate multiple dimensions, perspectives, and citizenships into everyday lessons. It began as an undertaking to restructure education and society in the 1960s and 1970s, through the initiatives of educationalists, NGOs and intergovernmental organizations. This global approach seeks to break an educational program that is stuck in subject knowledge and national culture, and instead, seeks to discover alternative motivations for education and alternate futures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Standish|first=Alex|date=2014|title=What is global education and where is it taking us?|journal=The Curriculum Journal|volume=25|issue=2|pages=166–186|doi=10.1080/09585176.2013.870081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, it is perceived to enable young people to participate in shaping a better, shared future for the world. It emphasizes the unity and interdependence of human society, developing a sense of self and appreciation of cultural diversity, affirmation of social justice and human rights, as well as building peace and actions for a sustainable future at different times and places. This approach is also believed to promote positive values and prods students to take responsibility for their actions and see themselves as global citizens who can contribute to a more peaceful, just and sustainable world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globaleducation.edu.au/global-education/what-is-global-ed.html|title=What is global education? {{!}} Global Education|website=www.globaleducation.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* It is not a subject but a dimension that runs through the curriculum, an extra filter to help children make sense of all the information and opinions the world throws at them. It combines methodology - active and experiential discussion based activities, a caring, co-operative and open outlook on the classroom experience, and core concerns- finding out about all the world's cultures and groups, about the causes of poverty and inequality and about the environment.
* It is a way of approaching everything being taught and how it is taught. It broadens horizons and encourages exploration of all subjects from a global perspective.

* A creative approach to bring about change in society.
* An active learning process based on the universal values of tolerance, solidarity, equality, justice, inclusion, co-operation and non-violence.
* It begins with raising awareness of global challenges and creates a deeper understanding of the complex underlying issues thereby changing people‘s attitudes and encourages them to reflect on their own role in the world.

== American universities global education programs ==
Universities in the United States have recently been expanding on the degree programs relating to global education. Many universities offer Bachelor Degree programs and certifications in Global Education, M.S. degrees in Global and International Education, M.A. degrees in International Education, and doctorate degrees in International Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cies.us/?page=Programs US Programs]. (n.d.). Retrieved April 24, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Careers ==
People with a degree in International Education design, implement, manage, and evaluate multiple education programs within public and private primary and secondary schools, public and private higher education programs, national corporations, and cultural agencies. People in the job field can work at agencies across the world, within elite universities, and a variety of global education organizations.&lt;ref&gt;'''Department of Humanities and Social Sciences in the Professions. (n.d.). Retrieved April 24, 2016, from''' http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/humsocsci/international/CareersinInternationalEducation
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and organizations ==
In January 2016, the Institute of International Education (IIE) announced the winners at the annual IIE Andrew Heiskell Awards for Innovation on International Education. The Heiskell awards were created to promote and honor outstanding commitments conducted in international higher education. Categories of the awards include: Internationalizing the Campus, Study Abroad, International Partnerships, and Internationalizing the HBCU. These awards hope to bring public awareness to the benefits of international education.&lt;ref&gt;'''Press Release. (n.d.).

== Children's literature ==
Evidence based practices have shown that literature can help children learn about global issues. By exploring diversity in text, connecting the literature to service learning and activism, promote critical thinking about themselves in the global community, and develop their global awareness with literacy elements. Literature introduced in the classroom can teach multiple skills that prepare for further learning within the global community.&lt;ref&gt;'''ERIC - Breaking Boundaries with Global Literature: Celebrating Diversity in K-12 Classrooms, International Reading Association (NJ3), 2007. (n.d.). Retrieved April 24, 2016, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED497893&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
Technology is a key provider in learning about globalization and participating in the global community. Technology can be used in the classroom to communicate around the world, establish global relationships, learn more about global current events, and developing global research. The advancements of technology will have a positive impact of global education in primary schools and higher education schools.&lt;ref&gt;'''Mapping the future: The future of education. (n.d.).

== Service learning ==
Service learning or local volunteer service work are included in conceptualized [[global citizenship]] programs. This approach is criticized because global relations are dramatically split into rich and poor, or oppressor and oppressed, respectively. Experiences of oppression are more complex than experiences of oppressing. [[Global citizenship education]] includes connecting nearby and worldwide issues and points of view and may incorporate such themes as human rights, social equity, and citizenship instruction, economic improvement, and globalization. Service learning can carry the possibility to recreate social disparities and advance, instead of dissipate, stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Aktas, Fatih, et al. “Institutionalizing Global Citizenship.” Journal of Studies in International Education, vol. 21, no. 1, 2016, pp. 65–80., doi:10.1177/1028315316669815.&lt;/ref&gt;

Published in 2000 in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] by the [[Writers Publishing House]], the book details the rigorous lifestyle that Liu led and includes advice from Liu's parents on how to raise children to gain acceptance to top-tier universities; it has been described as a "manual" for child-rearing and early education.&lt;ref name=HarvardMag/&gt;

The book was a bestseller in [[mainland China]] and made both Harvard and Liu Yiting household names among Chinese parents and students. It has since had numerous imitators, spawning an entire genre of how-to books on child-rearing for Chinese parents.

==Biography of Liu Yiting==
Liu was raised in [[Chengdu]], the capital of [[Sichuan]] province.  Liu's parents, believers in the value of [[early childhood education]], subjected her to a rigorous education since she was just 15 days old. For example, to ensure that someone was always talking to Liu, they invited relatives over to the house. They also had her participate in "character-building" physical exercises such as swimming, jumping rope, and holding ice in her hands for extended periods of time.&lt;ref name=Boston/&gt;&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/covers/501030217/harvard.html | work=[[TIME Asia]] | last=Marshall | first=Andrew | date=17 February 2003 | accessdate=19 February 2009 | title=How Harvard Came Calling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liu also acted in a [[soap opera]] when she was five years old.&lt;ref name=CHE&gt;{{cite journal | work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | title=China's 'Harvard Girl' | last=Lin-Liu | first=Jen | url=http://chronicle.com/weekly/v49/i38/38a04001.htm | accessdate=19 February 2009 | date=30 May 2003 | volume=49 | issue=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in high school, Liu met then [[Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher]] [[Partner (business rank)|partner]] Larry L. Simms, a [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] and [[Boston University|BU]] [[Boston University School of Law|Law]] alumnus and former [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] who [[Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States#Law_clerks|clerked]] for [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|justice]] [[Byron White]] and worked as [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Deputy Assistant Attorney General]] for the [[Office of Legal Counsel]] from 1975 to 1985. With Simms' assistance, Liu participated in a [[student exchange program]] sponsored by Washington-Beijing Scholastic Exchange, Inc., of which Simms was the founder and President, and visited America in 1998. This experience changed her views about life in America, because like many Chinese citizens, most of her impressions about America came from [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]], and when she came to the country she was "surprised that [she] didn't see any street fights or police-car chases".&lt;ref name=CHE/&gt;  The program also piqued her interest in American universities,&lt;ref name=CHE/&gt; where she realized she would be able to study a variety of subjects.&lt;ref name=SCMP/&gt;

Although they had been training her to attend a preeminent university, Liu's parents had not expected that she would attend an American one; her mother has said that until Liu came back from America, she had not been aware that Chinese students could apply to American universities.  At the time, it was unusual for Chinese students to attend American schools as [[undergraduate]]s, as most only applied to schools abroad for [[postgraduate education]].&lt;ref name=CHE/&gt; However, rather than taking the ''[[gaokao]],'' China's national college entrance examination, and attending one of the [[National Key Universities]], Liu applied to American colleges with recommendation from Simms. She was accepted to several schools, including [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Wellesley College|Wellesley]], and [[Mount Holyoke College|Mount Holyoke]], from which she ultimately chose to attend Harvard.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SCMP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="epoch"&gt;{{cite web | work=[[Epoch Times]] | accessdate=14 April 2009 | date=8 December 2004 | url=http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/4/12/8/n741124.htm | title=教育偶像--哈佛女孩劉亦婷再遭質疑 (Education idol: Harvard Girl Liu Yiting again called into question)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not long afterwards, a local newspaper announced her acceptance and the family was "besieged with thousands of phone calls".&lt;ref name="Meyer" /&gt;

At Harvard, Liu majored in [[applied mathematics]] and [[economics]] and earned high grades;&lt;ref name=CHE/&gt; she also chaired the [[The Harvard Project for Asian and International Relations|Harvard Project for Asian and International Relations]], a student organization.&lt;ref name=HarvardMag/&gt; She was described as "unassuming" and a "typical student", to the point that it took her roommate four years to realize Liu was a celebrity in China.&lt;ref name=CHE/&gt; In 2003, Liu graduated and took a job at the [[Boston Consulting Group]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=Boston/&gt;&lt;ref name=CHE/&gt;

==Synopsis==
Liu Weihua (Liu's mother) and Zhang Xinwu (Liu's stepfather) published ''Harvard Girl'' in 2000, after Liu had matriculated at Harvard.&lt;ref name=Crimson/&gt;  According to Liu, her parents had plans early on to write about their parenting methods, but they waited until 2000 to publish the book, relying on Liu's perceived success to establish themselves as "experts".&lt;ref name=HarvardMag/&gt;  The book primarily consists of research-like notes and diary entries, which Liu and her parents began recording and saving before Liu was in first grade. Liu herself helped edit the book, and wrote several of the later chapters.&lt;ref name=CHE/&gt;

One major element of the child-rearing strategy described in the book was treating Liu as an adult and "encourag[ing] her to develop a mature style of thinking".&lt;ref name=SCMP&gt;{{cite news | work=[[South China Morning Post]] | title=Smart thinking creates a recipe for success | last=Ng | first=I-Ching Florence | date=3 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Liu's parents never used [[baby talk]] when Liu was a child, and they allowed her to argue with them but required her to present reasoned arguments like an adult.&lt;ref name=CHE/&gt;  According to education scholar Ben Mardell, the book's focus on independent thinking and intellectual development was a "break with the past" in China,&lt;ref name=Meyer/&gt; where both early and higher education often emphasize [[rote learning]].&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite web | title=Learning the Hard Way | work=[[Newsweek]] | url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/60035 | last=Kantrowitz | first=Barbara | date=15 September 2003 | accessdate=10 April 2009 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the book details the rigorous "character-building exercises" Liu's parents had her perform.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; In addition to having her do physical exercises, Liu's parents controlled her diet.  They also frequently took her traveling, both on short trips to nearby rural areas and on longer trips to historical sites such as [[Xi'an]].&lt;ref name=CHE/&gt;  Throughout the book, high value is placed on "full development", and the writers encourage parents to cultivate more than just academic ability in their children.&lt;ref name=SCMP/&gt;

The book also includes supplementary chapters on topics such as how to select which schools to apply to, and advice for students on filling out applications and taking [[TOEFL]] and [[SAT]] exams.&lt;ref name=SCMP/&gt;

==Impact==
The book was at the top of China's [[bestseller]] list for 16 months,&lt;ref name=theage&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/05/05/1019441458295.html | work=[[The Age]] | last=Schauble | first=John | title=US school story a huge Chinese hit | date=6 May 2002 | accessdate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which time it sold at least 1.5 million copies&lt;ref group=note&gt;The exact number of sales is unclear; while it had sold about 1.5 million copies through the publisher by early 2003, it was estimated that 2 million more [[Copyright infringement|infringing]] copies were sold in the same time period (Lin-Liu 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; and the writers were estimated to have earned at least the equivalent of [[United States dollar|$]]100,000 in [[royalties]].&lt;ref name=spock/&gt;  It became a must-have book for middle-class parents in China.&lt;ref name=Boston/&gt;  The popularity of ''Harvard Girl'' made Liu a "national superstar"&lt;ref name=Boston/&gt; and an "idol" for Chinese parents,&lt;ref name=epoch_quote&gt;{{cite web | work=[[Epoch Times]] | accessdate=14 April 2009 | date=3 December 2004 | url=http://www.epochtimes.com/b5/4/12/8/n741124.htm | title=教育偶像--哈佛女孩劉亦婷再遭質疑 (Education idol: Harvard Girl Liu Yiting again called into question)}}&lt;br/&gt;劉亦婷，已成為許多中國家長心目中的偶像，教育的偶像。 (''English'': "Liu Yiting has become an idol in the eyes of many Chinese parents, an education idol.").&lt;/ref&gt; and she frequently received fan mail and drew large crowds at book signings in mainland China.&lt;ref name=HarvardMag/&gt;  The success of this and similar books (another bestseller in 2001 and 2002 was [[Robert Kiyosaki]]'s ''[[Rich Dad Poor Dad]]''&lt;ref name=bestsellers/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Readers' concerns: How to get rich; Management and self-help books are the region's bestsellers with readers seeking new opportunities as Asia liberalises | work=[[The Straits Times]] | date=20 May 2002| first=Shefali | last=Rekhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in mainland China has been said to reflect a "national obsession" among Chinese parents to get their children into top-ranking American schools.&lt;ref name=Boston/&gt;

''Harvard Girl'' was followed by numerous imitations by parents of other successful students, and is said to have spawned an entire genre of education "manuals" for Chinese parents, including similar books on how to get one's children into schools such as [[Oxford University]], [[Cambridge University]], or [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref name=HarvardMag&gt;{{cite web | url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2002/07/harvard-girl.html | title=Harvard Girl | year=2002 | accessdate=19 February 2009 | work=[[Harvard Magazine]] | first=Eugenia V. | last=Levenson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boston&gt;{{cite web | date=4 January 2009 | accessdate=19 February 2009 | title=In China, Ivy League dreams weigh heavily on students | url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2008/12/31/in_china_ivy_league_dreams_weigh_heavily_on_students/ | work=[[The Boston Globe]] | last=Jan | first=Tracy}} Also accessible at ''[http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/01/04/mideast/ivy.php International Herald Tribune]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Crimson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=9zo3HgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Tom+Friedman | last=Friedman | first=Tom | title=The World is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century | isbn=0374292884 | year=2005 | publisher=Farrar Straus &amp; Giroux | quote=In 1999, Yiting Liu, a schoolgirl from Chengdu, China, was accepted to Harvard on a full scholarship.

Comparable books have also been published in [[South Korea]], although American undergraduate universities are not "revered" in the same way there as they are in mainland China.&lt;ref name=Crimson/&gt;  In addition to imitators, Liu's parents have written their own follow-up: ''Harvard Girl 2: Liu Yiting's Studying Methods and Upbringing Details'' (＜哈佛女孩刘亦婷＞之二： 刘亦婷的学习方法和培养细节), which describes Liu's four years in college, was published in 2004 by Writers Publishing House.&lt;ref name=epoch/&gt;&lt;ref name=HG2&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/book/2004-03/23/content_1378535.htm | publisher=[[Xinhua]] | date=23 March 2004 | accessdate=12 April 2009 | title=《&lt;哈佛女孩刘亦婷&gt;之二》：四年的哈佛时光 ("Harvard Girl 2": Four Years in Harvard)}} 北京娱乐信报 (Beijing Yule Newspaper).&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also affected applications to Harvard. It made Harvard a household name in China, and books of this genre caused a significant increase in the number of Chinese applicants to top-tier American universities.&lt;ref name=Crimson/&gt;  In 1999, Liu and 43 other Chinese students applied to Harvard, and by 2008, 484 Chinese students had.&lt;ref name=Boston/&gt;

===Criticism===
The book has been criticized for increasing the pressure many Chinese students already had to succeed in school, and for taking advantage of the widespread belief that admission into leading universities is necessary for success in life.&lt;ref name=CHE/&gt; Some critics have called the book "boastful."&lt;ref name=Boston/&gt;&lt;ref name=query&gt;{{cite web | url=http://edu.hsw.cn/2004-12/06/content_1473656.htm | work=千龙新闻网 (Qianlong News online) | publisher=Huash.com | title=哈佛女孩刘亦婷受质疑 (Harvard Girl Liu Yiting faces query) | date=6 December 2004 | accessdate=12 April 2009 | author=许凯 (Xu Kai)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2001 study by a group of educators claimed that the strategies described in the book would not work for everyone even though they had worked for Liu, and that many families following the book's advice would be disappointed.&lt;ref name=epoch/&gt;

A 2004 book by Xiao Hui (萧愚), entitled ''Raising Children Requires Great Wisdom: The Truth About "Harvard Girl Liu Yiting"'' (教育孩子需要大智慧：“哈佛女孩刘亦婷”真相), harshly criticizes ''Harvard Girl'',&lt;ref name=epoch/&gt; calling the methods described in the book "false character building" ("伪素质教育") and claiming that Liu gained entrance into Harvard not because of her comprehensive or well-rounded education,&lt;ref name=qianyan&gt;{{cite web | url=http://edu.sina.com.cn/l/2004-11-16/ba91433.shtml | publisher=[[Sina.com]] | title=哈佛女孩刘亦婷真相前言 (The Truth About "Harvard Girl Liu Yiting": Preface) | author=萧愚 (Xiao Hui) | date=15 November 2004 | accessdate=12 April 2009 | quote=刘亦婷的家长认为，能够被哈佛录取是个神话一般的故事，只有素质最全面，能力最出色，表现最杰出的学生才能被哈佛录取。可实际上呢？大家读过本书后就会发现，即便是普通的学生，只要策划得法，加上一点点运气，也能够大摇大摆地进入哈佛大学。 ("Liu Yiting's parents claim that being accepted to Harvard is a fabulous story, and that only a student with the most well-rounded character, outstanding abilities, and most remarkable performance could be accepted.

Many successful Chinese students after Liu have tried to distance themselves from the so-called "Harvard Girl Phenomenon;"&lt;ref name=Crimson/&gt; Harvard students Yin Zhongrui and Tang Meijie have both stated they do not want to be compared to "Harvard Girl."&lt;ref name=Boston/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E5DA1230F932A35757C0A9619C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink | last=Hulbert | first=Anne | date=1 April 2007 | accessdate=19 February 2009 | title=Re-Education | work=[[The New York Times]]}} Also accessible at ''[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/04/01/asia/web-0401reeducate.php International Herald Tribune]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yin's mother published a book, ''From Andover to Harvard'', about how her son was accepted by Harvard, but Yin only allowed his full name to appear in the book's preface.&lt;ref name=Boston/&gt;  Tang received at least six offers from publishers to have a book written about her, but declined them all.&lt;ref name=Crimson&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=516260 | accessdate=19 February 2009 | work=[[The Harvard Crimson]] | title=From Asia with Love: How undergrads from the Pacific Rim are writing about Harvard in their native languages | date=7 December 2006 | author=Wang Ying and Zhou Lulu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many of China's top students are still compared to "Harvard Girl," and admissions to top overseas universities often make big news in mainland China; for example, Cheng Wanxin (程琬芯) attracted media attention in Sichuan province when she was accepted to Harvard in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.sina.com.cn/s/2009-04-10/044817580390.shtml | publisher=[[Sina.com]] | date=10 April 2009 | title=成都女孩被哈佛录取 校方称看重其责任感 (Chengdu girl admitted to Harvard; school says it values her sense of responsibility | accessdate=14 April 2009 | author=彭世军 (Peng Shijun)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://edu.sina.com.cn/a/2009-04-14/1112169130.shtml | publisher=[[Sina.com]] | title=哈佛女孩：申请到全奖的神奇过程 (Harvard Girl:　the miraculous process of winning a full scholarship) | date=14 April 2009 | accessdate=14 April 2009 | work= 四川在线-华西都市报 | author=肖笛 (Xiao Di)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Modern Languages''', also known as IML-UQ, is a language and translation institute located within the [[St Lucia]] campus of the [[University of Queensland]] (UQ) in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]. Today IML-UQ enrolls 3000 plus students annually in all of its language programs.

IML-UQ provides courses in over 30 languages. Designed to enrich the knowledge of a language and its culture, these courses are taught by native speakers with a focus on enhancing fluency and accuracy of expression. Apart from Latin, their content is based on themes and topics of the modern world in which we live.

IML-UQ is an [[Australians|Australian]] translator and interpreter service for 75 different languages, specialising in [[English Language|English]] language translations. Languages available at the IML-UQ include [[Arabic Language|Arabic]], [[Brazilian Portuguese Language|Brazilian Portuguese]], [[Cantonese]], [[Standard Chinese|Chinese Mandarin]], [[Croatian Language|Croatian]], [[Czech Language|Czech]], [[Dutch Language|Dutch]], [[Danish Language|Danish]], [[Finnish Language|Finnish]], [[French Language|French]], [[Greek Language|Greek]], [[German Language|German]], [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]], [[Hindi Language|Hindi]], [[Indonesian Language|Indonesian]], [[Italian Language|Italian]], [[Japanese Language|Japanese]], [[Korean Language|Korean]], [[Latin Language|Latin]], [[Norwegian Language|Norwegian]], [[Persian Language|Persian]], [[Polish Language|Polish]], [[Russian Language|Russian]], [[Spanish Language|Spanish]], [[Swedish Language|Swedish]], [[Thai Language|Thai]], [[Turkish Language|Turkish]] and [[Vietnamese Language|Vietnamese]] amongst many others.

Established in 1934, IML-UQ continues to serve the community by facilitating language learning and [[cross-cultural]] communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Working Papers in Asian Studies | issue = 6 | publisher = Centre for Asian Studies, The University of Western Australia | year = 1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years it has sought to develop strategies to reach out to students in order to enrich their experience of learning another language. IML-UQ still meets the language service needs of the corporate sector, small businesses, government departments and community organisations. 
IML-UQ seeks to fulfill the original aspiration of the University of Queensland Senate to give more adults the chance to deepen their lives by bringing them into the university community via language courses open to the public.  
IML-UQ also provides a vehicle for UQ students to remain connected with its alumni in a meaningful way over the decades in which they are no longer engaged in more formal study.

== Background ==
When the seventh Senate of the University of Queensland met in March 1932, it stated its intentions "…to serve increasingly, despite straitened resources, not only education but whatever public needs science and learning could serve."&lt;ref name="AccountUQ"&gt;The University of Queensland. An Account of The University of Queensland during its First Twenty-five Years: 1910-1935.Brisbane: Biggs &amp; Company Pty., 1935, pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the ways these intentions were made manifest in 1934 was "to bring those classes under an Institute of Modern Languages (IML-UQ) associated with the Faculties of Arts and Commerce and to offer through it instruction in any modern language for which there should be a sufficient demand."&lt;ref name="AccountUQ"/&gt;

The successful launching of the IML-UQ was largely the result of the personal commitment to non-traditional university studies of a number of prominent University of Queensland academics. These academics recognised the demand for language teaching from the community at large.&lt;ref&gt;Thomis, I. Malcolm. A Place of Light &amp; Learning: The University of Queensland’s First Seventy-five Years. St Lucia: University of Queensland Press, 1985, p. 132-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation ==
When IML-UQ was established at the University of Queensland on 11 May 1934, it was the first adult education extension unit in modern languages to be attached to an Australian tertiary education institution. According to a university statute, IML-UQ was intended to "promote and extend the teaching of Modern Languages."&lt;ref&gt;McCaffrey, J. F. Statute Relating to the Institute of Modern Languages: The University of Queensland Act of 1909, Section 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The Telegraph reported the University’s decision to establish IML-UQ as follows (12 May 1934): "At the meeting of the University Senate yesterday afternoon a recommendation for the establishment of IML-UQ was approved. This is clearly an important educational development, since it provides machinery for the study of foreign languages that have a cultural and commercial value for the State, and for which no provision is made in secondary schools for Junior, Senior, and Matriculation purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Thomis, I. Malcolm. A Place of Light &amp; Learning: The University of Queensland’s First Seventy-five Years. St Lucia: University of Queensland Press, 1985, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

IML-UQ commenced operations with one class each in French and Italian and two in German. In an article entitled ‘A Wider National Perspective’ (Courier-Mail, 14 May 1934, see page 5), the author articulates a vision of language education serving the national interest. The view was that IML-UQ courses would provide training in practical skills which would benefit business and international travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = A Wider National Perspective | publisher = The Courier Mail (Brisbane), 14 May 1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Language programs were also endorsed as suitable educational ventures towards better international understanding and tolerance.

Australia’s changing perceptions of the non-English speaking world were reflected through the changing patterns of IML-UQ enrolments. New prospects in international commerce and tourism and the evolution of a cosmopolitan Australian society through post-war immigration were reflected in the diversification of language courses. These new courses were offered in response to public demand.

In another article, entitled ‘Foreign Languages’, which appeared in the Courier-Mail on the same day, the new IML-UQ courses were defined as follows: "The courses were…for commercial purposes, and would not enter so deeply into the literature of the languages as in an ordinary degree course, but rather would aim at the impartation of good working business knowledge of each tongue dealt with." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Foreign Languages | publisher = The Courier Mail (Brisbane), 14 May 1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching methods ==
The history of language teaching at IML-UQ has been characterised by an ongoing search for more effective ways of teaching languages. 
The Grammar Translation Method was the main language teaching method in the initial decades. After this the Direct Method, which emphasises listening and speaking skills, was introduced.

Today, languages are primarily taught using the Communicative and Intercultural Language Teaching and Learning approaches with less emphasis on whole class activities and more on pair and group work.

== History ==

=== The early years: 1935–1965 ===
On 23 April 1934, resolutions to create a constitution and rules were passed by IML-UQ Joint Sub-Committee of the Faculties of Arts and Commerce. By 1937, special courses were added for those involved in scientific work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Institute of Modern Languages | publisher = The Courier Mail (Brisbane), 27 Feb 1937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, students of Russian reflected a sentiment that, "Russian will probably be useful in the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = They say Russian may be Useful | publisher = The Courier Mail (Brisbane), 29 March 1952 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1954, IML-UQ had grown to the point that a review of its purposes, services and administrative structures was required. The main priority was to establish IML-UQ as a provider of ‘adult education’, where courses would not enter ‘deeply into literature’ but focus on a ‘good working knowledge’ for practical application; followed by the expectation to satisfy requirements set for honours students in the Faculty of Commerce; and lastly to provide access to languages for which there was no provision in schools for Junior, Senior and Matriculation purposes.

All IML-UQ classes were held in the [[Old Government House, Queensland|Old Government House]] on [[George Street, Brisbane|George Street]]. By the late 1960s, all IML-UQ classes were transferred to the St Lucia campus, where they remain today. The first full-time IML-UQ director was appointed in 1965.

=== The middle years: 1965–1998 ===
Donald Munro was the first full-time Director of IML-UQ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Diaries of a Stretcher-Bearer: 1916-1918 | publisher = Boolarong Press | year = 2010 | author = Edward Munro | editor = Donald Munro | isbn = 1921555556 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1965 - 1970.

Mr Munro advocated the idea that learning languages would assist in community engagement. He believed that the study of a language would help students to understand the perspective of those who spoke that language. In his own words, his assumption was that "language and culture cannot be separated."&lt;ref&gt;D.J. Munro, "The University of Queensland Institute of Modern Languages," in Education News 10, no.10 (August 1966), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  He advocated that the study of language could itself form a cultural bridge, and thus is important for Australia’s migrant population.

He began a move to audio-lingual teaching methods by acquiring new teaching and learning equipment which could simultaneously play and record, so that students could compare their pronunciation with a master track.

Dr Max Brändle the second full-time IML-UQ director from 1970 - 1998, taught 5 languages at IML-UQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The German presence in Queensland over the last 150 years: proceedings of an international symposium, August 24, 25, and 26, 1987|last=|first=|publisher=University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia|year=|isbn=0867762527|location=|page=397|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[blogs.abc.net.au/queensland/2010/09/faces-of-brisbane-max-brandle-from-switzerland.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
During Dr Brändle’s time as IML-UQ director, IML-UQ established the first commercial ELICOS (English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students) centre in Australia that taught English solely to individual, full-fee paying students.  In 1988 the University set up a separate TESOL unit, now known as the [[Institute of Continuing &amp; TESOL Education]].

=== The later years (1999–) ===
Georgiana Poulter became the new IML-UQ Director in 1999, commencing a series of functional changes to the structure of Institute. 
In response to the increasing trend of global business, IML-UQ now includes a translation and interpreting service appropriate to the international market inclusive of local cultural needs. External clients range from the mining and engineering industry, to law firms, government departments, migration agents, and the IT, travel and advertising industries.

To enhance the effectiveness of teaching and learning which is the primary focus of IML-UQ, in-house training, or Professional Development (PD), workshops are now implemented for tutors and staff, and involvement with professional associations is encouraged. 
Translation, interpreting, language courses and customised tuition are the foundational components to support the purpose of IML-UQ in its ongoing role facilitating community engagement and links between UQ and the Brisbane community.

== Language programs ==

=== Adult programs ===
IML-UQ is designed to enhance employment opportunities, improve communication abilities, support lifelong learning and international travel, and maintain language skills in a practical adult (16+) learning environment. Year courses commence March of each year, and second semester courses commence in July. Short courses are offered in Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter.

Languages currently taught at IML-UQ are:
Arabic, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese (Cantonese), Chinese (Mandarin), Croatian, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek (Modern), Hebrew (Modern), Hindi, Indonesian, Irish Gaelic, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese.

=== Customised courses===
IML-UQ offers one-on-one and small group private tuition in most languages customised for business, government departments, companies, travel preparation, research, personal development and cross-cultural communication. Customised courses are designed to offer flexibility in course content, structure and teaching style at venues and times that suit the needs of students. Qualified and experienced tutors are selected specifically for each organisation or individual.

=== Summer high school program ===
These language enrichment courses are designed for students in the Senior phase of learning who wish to enrich their knowledge of the language and culture they are currently studying and practise their language skills over the long Summer holidays. The courses are taught by native speakers with a focus on enhancing fluency and accuracy of expression, with content based on themes and topics specified in the QSA Senior Syllabus.

The '''International Business Education Alliance''' ('''IBEA''') is an exchange programme for undergraduate students in Business Administration. Besides studying at their home university, admitted undergraduate students participate in an extended bachelor's program that includes three exchange semesters at the participating institutions in the network. Participants are the [[University of Mannheim]] (Germany),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/home/|title=University of Mannheim Business School|publisher=uni-mannheim.de |accessdate=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ESSEC|ESSEC Business School]] (France),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essec.edu|title=ESSEC Business School|publisher=essec.edu |accessdate=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of South Carolina|University of South Carolina, Darla Moore School of Business]] (United States),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moore.sc.edu/ |title=Darla Moore School of Business - University of South Carolina|publisher=moore.sc.edu |accessdate=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Fundação Getúlio Vargas]] ([[Brazil]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.fgv.br/|title=FGV Business School|publisher=fgv.br |accessdate=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
IBEA was founded on August 1, 2015 when the deans of the respective business schools agreed to form the new partnership alliance IBEA. Its President is Jürgen M. Schneider, the dean of the University of Mannheim Business School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibea-bachelor.org/ |title=IBEA: The International Business Education Alliance |publisher=ibea-bachelor.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The IBEA program aims to provide undergraduate business students with a comprehensive view of the global environment of business. It consists of a four-year Bachelor program that draws on the academic expertise of each participating partner school. Selected students study part of the program as one cohort and stay one semester at each of the four participating institutions. Each school offers customized classes and cultural courses designed for IBEA students. Besides a local and regional exposure, students gain hands-on global management experience by working closely with one corporate partner from each school. The program started in fall 2015, with the first class of around 40 students expected to graduate in spring 2019. The first three semesters are completed at each student’s individual home institution. Beginning with the fourth semester, the IBEA students study for the subsequent four semesters, starting at the University of Mannheim, Business School, followed by the Darla Moore School of Business of the University of South Carolina and ESSEC’s newly inaugurated campus in [[Singapore]]. The last study abroad semester is spent at the Brazilian School of Public and Business Administration in [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/presse/pressemitteilungen/press_releases/news/mit-dem-bachelor-um-die-welt-neue-auswahloption-im-mannheimer-bachelorprogramm-startet-ab-herbst-20/ |title=About: The International Business Education Alliance |publisher=University of Mannheim |accessdate=2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moore.sc.edu/academicprograms/undergraduate/majorsoffered/internationalbusiness/optionsoverviews/ibeamulticultural.aspx |title=About: The International Business Education Alliance |publisher=University of South Carolina |accessdate=2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Katzir Fellowships''' is an israeli [[Funding of science|research-granting]] [[research program|program]], founded in 1991, that was developed in order to recruit high-quality scientists to national defense research and development agencies, who in the future will become the leaders of these technological branches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.weizmann.ac.il/RGP_open/postdoc/Katzir.html Katzir Fellowships Program] in [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] website&lt;/ref&gt; The program was recommended by a committee which advises the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|minister of defense]] on research and development in the defense sector, led by Professor [[Joshua Jortner]].

The fellowship's committee (which was named after Professor [[Aharon Katzir]]) provides for outstanding scientists who specialize in science and technology a three-year fellowships intended to finance training, as well as a three-year fellowship during the transitional period into the defense sector and into the research work within this sector. The fellowships are awarded to eligible scientists within the program under the initiative and patronage of the minister of defense, and it operates under the purview of the [[Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure]] (Maf'at) within the ministry of defense (which also manages within the framework of technological and research training the [[Psagot program|Psagot]] and [[Talpiot program|Talpiot]] programs). 

According to the program's policies, the fellowship committee "''will put forth efforts to successfully recruit brilliant young scientists, who will grow within the research and development sector and who can lead the sector to meet the needs of the new [[millennium]]''."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.weizmann.ac.il/RGP_open/pc/Katzir.pdf The Katzir Fellowship Regulations] by the [[Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure]] (Maf'at), May 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The institution that receives the fellows is responsible for designing their training programs, customized to their skills, experience and the issues to which they are assigned. The training program includes training fellows and placing them in positions that will further their training to management positions in defense research and development agencies scattered in various parts of the [[Israel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33143">A '''lie-to-children''' (plural '''lies-to-children''') is a simplified explanation of technical or complex subjects as a teaching method for children and [[Layperson|laypeople]]. The technique has been incorporated by academics within the fields of [[biology]], [[evolution]], [[bioinformatics]] and the [[social sciences]]. It is closely related to the philosophical concept known as [[Wittgenstein's ladder]].

The "lie-to-children" concept was first discussed by scientist [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]] and mathematician [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] in the 1994 book ''[[The Collapse of Chaos]]: Discovering Simplicity in a Complex World''.&lt;ref name="andysawyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="collapse"&gt;{{cite book | title = [[The Collapse of Chaos]]: Discovering Simplicity in a Complex World|first2=Ian |last2=Stewart|author-link2=Ian Stewart (mathematician)|first1=Jack|last1=Cohen|authorlink1=Jack Cohen (scientist)|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|year=1994|isbn=978-0-670-84983-3|pages=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They further elaborated upon their views in their coauthored 1997 book ''[[Figments of Reality]]: The Evolution of the Curious Mind''.&lt;ref name="andysawyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="butler"&gt;{{cite book|first=Andrew|last=Sawyer|chapter=Narrativium and Lies-to-Children: 'Palatable Instruction in 'The Science of Discworld'|authorlink=Andrew Sawyer|pages=80–82|editor1-first=Andrew M.|editor1-last=Butler|title=An Unofficial Companion to the Novels of Terry Pratchett|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-1-84645-043-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="figments"&gt;{{cite book | title = [[Figments of Reality]]: The Evolution of the Curious Mind|first1=Ian |last1=Stewart|author-link1=Ian Stewart (mathematician)|first2=Jack|last2=Cohen|authorlink2=Jack Cohen (scientist)|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1997|isbn=978-0-521-57155-5|pages=37–38; 140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept gained greater exposure when they collaborated with popular author [[Terry Pratchett]], discussing "lies-to-children" in the book ''[[The Science of Discworld]]'' (1999).&lt;ref name="pratchett"&gt;{{cite book | title = [[The Science of Discworld]] | first1 = Terry | last1 = Pratchett | author-link1 = Terry Pratchett | first2 = Ian|last2=Stewart|author-link2=Ian Stewart (mathematician)|first3=Jack|last3=Cohen | author-link3=Jack Cohen (scientist)|isbn =978-0-8041-6894-6|year=2014 |pages=28–30|publisher=Anchor; 2014 Reprint Edition of 1999 book; Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="teachinglinear" /&gt;

Cohen and Stewart discussed "lies-to-children" and the desire inherent in society for a view of simplicity with regards to complex concepts in their 1994 book ''The Collapse of Chaos''.&lt;ref name="andysawyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="collapse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="publisherscollapse"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=27 February 2016|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-670-84983-3|title=Nonfiction Book Review: The Collapse of Chaos|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|date=April 1994|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227032441/http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-670-84983-3|archivedate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart and Cohen wrote in ''Figments of Reality'' (1997) that the lie-to-children concept reflected the difficulty inherent in reducing complex concepts during the education process.&lt;ref name="figments" /&gt;&lt;ref name="douglaschapman"&gt;{{cite news|first=Douglas|last=Chapman|title=Book Review – Figments of Reality: The Evolution of the Curious Mind|work=Strange Magazine|year=1997|accessdate=28 February 2016|url=http://www.strangemag.com/reviews/figmentsofreality.html|archivedate=19 September 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919014619/http://www.strangemag.com/reviews/figmentsofreality.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart and Cohen noted reality itself was viewed within the prism of human perspective: "Any description suitable for human minds to grasp must be ''some'' type of lie-to-children — real reality is always much too complicated for our limited minds."&lt;ref name="figments" /&gt;

Librarian and editor [[Andrew Sawyer]] discussed the "lie-to-children" concept introduced by scientists Cohen and Stewart in their early two non-fiction books.&lt;ref name="andysawyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt; Sawyer wrote: "In ''The Collapse of Chaos'' and ''Figments of Reality'', we also come across the concept of 'lies-to-children' — the necessarily simplified stories we tell children and students as a foundation for understanding so that eventually they can discover that they are not, in fact, ''true''."&lt;ref name="andysawyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt;

The definition given in ''The Science of Discworld'' (1999) is as follows: "A lie-to-children is a statement that is false, but which nevertheless leads the child's mind towards a more accurate explanation, one that the child will only be able to appreciate if it has been primed with the lie".&lt;ref name="walsh"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Kirsten|last1=Walsh|first2=Adrian|last2=Currie|title=Caricatures, Myths, and White Lies|journal=[[Metaphilosophy (journal)|Metaphilosophy]] |volume=46|issue=3|date=22 July 2015|pages=414–435|doi=10.1111/meta.12139|issn=1467-9973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fallis"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Don|last=Fallis|title=What Is Disinformation?|journal=[[Library Trends]]|volume=63|issue=3|year=2015|pages=401–426|doi=10.1353/lib.2015.0014|issn=0024-2594}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors acknowledge that some people might dispute the applicability of the term ''lie'', while defending it on the grounds that "it is for the best possible reasons, but it is still a lie".&lt;ref name="pratchett" /&gt; This viewpoint is derived from earlier perspectives within the field of [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref name="judge"&gt;{{cite book|first=Anthony|last=Judge|accessdate=28 February 2016|url=https://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs00s/mislead.php|chapter=Strategic leadership as essentially a "shell game" with potential opponents, followers and dissidents?|title=Emergence of a Global Misleadership Council – misleading as vital to governance of the future?|date=1 July 2007|archivedate=31 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031134328/http://www.laetusinpraesens.org/docs00s/mislead.php|publisher=Laetus in Praesens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1999 interview, Pratchett commented upon the phrase: "I ''like'' the lies-to-children motif, because it underlies the way we run our society and resonates nicely with Discworld."&lt;ref name="davidlangford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="langfordamazon" /&gt; He was critical of problems inherent in early education: "You arrive with your sparkling A-levels all agleam, and the first job of the tutors is to reveal that what you thought was true is only true for a given value of 'truth'."&lt;ref name="davidlangford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="langfordamazon" /&gt; Pratchett cautioned: "Most of us need just 'enough' knowledge of the sciences, and it's delivered to us in metaphors and analogies that bite us in the bum if we think they're the same as the truth."&lt;ref name="davidlangford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="langfordamazon" /&gt;

Cohen and Stewart further elaborated upon the lie-to-children trope in a 2002 book they coauthored on [[exobiology]], ''[[Evolving the Alien]]: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life''.&lt;ref name="langfordevolving"&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Langford|authorlink=David Langford|work=[[New Scientist]]|title=Evolving the Alien: The science of extraterrestrial life by Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart|date=5 October 2002|accessdate=28 February 2016|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17623636-300-evolving-the-alien-the-science-of-extraterrestrial-life-by-jack-cohen-and-ian-stewart/|subscription=yes|archivedate=28 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228172211/https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17623636-300-evolving-the-alien-the-science-of-extraterrestrial-life-by-jack-cohen-and-ian-stewart/|issn=0262-4079}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the work, the authors were critical of use of lie-to-children as an educational methodology which had an unfortunate side-effect of reducing complex science concepts to overly simplified explanations.&lt;ref name="langfordevolving" /&gt; Stewart was asked in a 2015 interview about his views on Pratchett beyond the influence of lie-to-children, and the author's take on the understanding of science.&lt;ref name="guardianstewart" /&gt; Stewart commented upon the interaction between himself and Cohen with Pratchett during the writing process: "Terry wasn't trained as a scientist, but he had the right kind of critical attitude. He was extraordinarily widely read, and would ask all sorts of unexpected questions that really got me and Jack thinking."&lt;ref name="guardianstewart"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=28 February 2016|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2015/jun/05/ian-stewart-on-the-science-of-terry-pratchetts-discworld-webchat|title=Ian Stewart on the science of Terry Pratchett's Discworld – as it happened|first=Sam|last=Jordison|date=9 June 2015|archivedate=29 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229081705/http://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2015/jun/05/ian-stewart-on-the-science-of-terry-pratchetts-discworld-webchat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors Michael Moorhouse and Paul Barry recommended the original works discussing the concept for further analysis of the phenomenon: "These are well worth a read if you fancy a laugh while pretending to work."&lt;ref name="moorhouse" /&gt;

== Use in adult education ==
The term "lie to children" should not be taken to imply that it is exclusively used in childhood education. Educators in secondary and post-secondary schools employ increasingly-accurate yet still "untrue" models as a means of explicating complex topics.

A typical example of this is found in physics, where the [[Bohr model]] of atomic electron shells is still often used to introduce atomic structure before moving on to [[Bohr model#Refinements|more complex models]] based on [[matrix mechanics]]; and in chemistry, where the [[Acid-base reaction#Arrhenius definition |Arrhenius definitions of acids and bases]] are often introduced, followed (in a manner similar to the historical development of the model) by the [[Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory |Brønsted–Lowry]] definitions and then the [[Lewis acids and bases |Lewis]] definitions.

High school teachers and university instructors often explain at the outset that the model they are about to present is incomplete. An example of this is given by [[Gerald Sussman]] during the 1986 video recording of the [[Hal Abelson |Abelson]]-Sussman Lectures ([https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/1b-procedures-and-processes-substitution-model/ lecture 1-b]):&lt;blockquote&gt;If we're going to understand processes and how we control them, then we have to have a mapping from the mechanisms of this procedure into the way in which these processes behave. What we're going to have is a formal, or semi-formal, mechanical model whereby you understand how a machine could, in fact, in principle, do this. Whether or not the actual machine really does what I'm about to tell you is completely irrelevant at this moment.

In fact, this is an [[Function model|engineering model]], in the same way that, [for an] electrical resistor, we write down a model V = IR — it's approximately true, but it's not really true; if I put enough current through the resistor, it goes boom, so the voltage is not always proportional to the current, but for some purposes the model is appropriate.

In particular, the model we're going to describe right now, which I call the substitution model, is the simplest model that we have for understanding how procedures work and how processes work — how procedures yield processes.

And that substitution model will be accurate for most of the things we'll be dealing with in the next few days. But eventually, it will become impossible to sustain the illusion that that's the way the machine works, and we'll go to other, more specific and particular models that will show more detail.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of lie-to-children was discussed at-length in 2000 by [[Andrew Sawyer]], where the subject itself was included in the article title: "Narrativium and Lies-to-Children: 'Palatable Instruction in 'The Science of Discworld'".&lt;ref name="andysawyer"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Andy|last=Sawyer|journal=Hungarian Journal of English and American Studies (HJEAS)|volume=6|issue=1|year=2000|pages=155–178|publisher=Centre for Arts, Humanities and Sciences (CAHS), acting on behalf of the University of Debrecen CAHS|jstor=41274079|subscription=yes|title=Narrativium and Lies-to-Children: 'Palatable Instruction in 'The Science of Discworld'|issn=1218-7364|authorlink=Andrew Sawyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt; Sawyer wrote that: "The 'lies-to-children' we tell ourselves about science are a different form of science fiction: one, perhaps where 'fiction' qualifies the word 'science.' They are 'fictions about science' rather than 'science fictions.'"&lt;ref name="andysawyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt; Sawyer concluded: "The strength of ''The Science of Discworld'' — and why in many ways it is something new in science writing — derives from Pratchett's story being more than a parable constructed for the specific purpose of explaining what the scientists have to say. It is, as has been said, a commentary/parody of the scientific method".&lt;ref name="andysawyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="butler" /&gt;

In a contribution about [[evolution]] for the 2001 book ''Nonlinear Dynamics in the Life and Social Sciences'', [[Reproductive biology|reproductive biologist]] [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]] discussed the lie-to-children teaching technique and its use educating students on the concept of evolution and its complex facets including the notion that [[DNA]] is an architectural guide for life.&lt;ref name="nonlinear" /&gt; The author concluded: "Only the search for universal features, while treasuring all the exceptional specifics, offers some hope of sketching out the general shape of the evolutionary process so that we can explain it honestly as a Lie-to-Children."&lt;ref name="nonlinear"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jack|last=Cohen|authorlink=Jack Cohen (scientist)|chapter=Complexity of Evolution|pages=357–359|editor1-first=William H. |editor1-last=Sulis|editor2-first= Irina Nikolaevna |editor2-last=Trofimova|title=Nonlinear Dynamics in the Life and Social Sciences|year=2001|series=NATO Science, Series A: Life Sciences, Vol. 320|publisher=IOS|isbn=978-1-58603-020-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D.J. Jeffrey and Robert M. Corless of the Ontario Research Centre for Computer Algebra at the [[University of Western Ontario]] wrote in their 2001 [[computer science]] paper on [[linear algebra]] instruction on the teaching concept.&lt;ref name="teachinglinear" /&gt; Jeffrey and Corless identified a "useful" lie-to-children, as one in which: "The pedagogical point is to avoid unnecessary burdens on the student’s first encounter with the concept."&lt;ref name="teachinglinear" /&gt; The authors gave an example from early childhood mathematics instruction: "We happily teach children that 'you cannot take 3 from 2' because we are confident that
someone will later introduce them to negative numbers."&lt;ref name="teachinglinear"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=D.J.|last1=Jeffrey|first2=Robert M.|last2=Corless|publisher=Ontario Research Centre for Computer Algebra at the [[University of Western Ontario]]|title=Teaching Linear Algebra with and to Computers|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227024502/http://epatcm.any2any.us/10thAnniversaryCD/EP/2001/ATCMP127/fullpaper.pdf|archivedate=27 February 2016|accessdate=27 February 2016|date=2001|url=http://epatcm.any2any.us/10thAnniversaryCD/EP/2001/ATCMP127/fullpaper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corless further expounded on this view in a subsequent paper published in 2004, writing: "A 'lie to children' is a useful oversimplification that starts one on the path to better knowledge. It is a truth unacknowledged that mathematics before computers was a lie to children."&lt;ref name="corless2004"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert M.|last=Corless|url=http://kong.apmaths.uwo.ca/~rcorless/frames/PAPERS/EDUC/CMTpaper.pdf|accessdate=27 February 2016|date=July 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227025107/http://kong.apmaths.uwo.ca/~rcorless/frames/PAPERS/EDUC/CMTpaper.pdf|archivedate=27 February 2016|title=Computer-Mediated Thinking|publisher=ORCCA and the Department of Applied Mathematics at the [[University of Western Ontario]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2004 book ''Bioinformatics, Biocomputing and Perl'', authors Michael Moorhouse and Paul Barry explained how the lie-to-children model may be utilized as a teaching technique for the concepts of [[protein]], [[RNA]], and DNA.&lt;ref name="moorhouse" /&gt; Moorhouse and Barry wrote that the lie-to-children methodology can reduce complex academic notions to a simpler format for basic understanding.&lt;ref name="moorhouse" /&gt; The authors conclude that the lie-to-children teaching technique: "allows the basic features to be understood without confusing things by considering exceptions and enhancements."&lt;ref name="moorhouse"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Michael|last1=Moorhouse|first2=Paul|last2=Barry|year=2004|pages=4–6|title=Bioinformatics Biocomputing and Perl: An Introduction to Bioinformatics Computing Skills and Practice|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-85331-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Haroom Kharem and Genevieve Collura were critical of the teaching practice, in a contribution to the 2010 book ''Teaching Bilingual/Bicultural Children''.&lt;ref name="kharem"&gt;{{cite book|year=2010|title=Teaching Bilingual/Bicultural Children: Teachers Talk about Language and Learning |chapter=Chapter Seventeen: Teachers Rethinking Their Pedagogical Attitudes in the Bicultural/Bilingual Classroom|pages=152–155|first1=Haroom|last1=Kharem|first2=Genevieve|last2=Collura|editor1-first=Lourdes Diaz|editor1-last= Soto|editor2-first=Haroon|editor2-last=Kharem|series=Counterpoints (Book 371)|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|isbn=978-1-4331-0718-4|jstor=42980693|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors wrote that using this teaching method was a form of disrespect for the truth.&lt;ref name="kharem" /&gt; Kharem and Collura lament that rather than imparting truth to children, "a pedagogy of stupidification is promoted in which teachers imbue students with untruths and then wonder why education has problems. Sooner or later the fabrications we teach students will come to light and the respect educators expect from students will become disingenuous."&lt;ref name="kharem" /&gt;

[[North Eastern Hill University]] [[economics]] professor Sudhanshu K. Mishra in 2010 defined the phrase as: "A lie-to-children is a lie, often a platitude, which may use euphemism(s), which is told to make an adult subject acceptable to children."&lt;ref name="mishra" /&gt; Mishra gave as an example parents who engage in mythology by lying to their children and telling them they were [[Stork#Storks and childbirth|brought by a stork to the house]], instead of explaining [[childbirth]].&lt;ref name="mishra"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Sudhanshu K. |last=Mishra|accessdate=28 February 2016|title=An Essay on the Nature and Significance of Deception and Telling Lies|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/22906/1/|date=23 May 2010|archivedate=28 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228033645/https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/22906/1/|journal=Munich Personal RePEc Archive; MPRA Paper No. 22906}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 contribution to the academic journal ''Digital Difference'', Hamish Macleod and Jen Ross discussed the lie-to-children concept and wrote that this teaching methodology can have the negative impact of introducing studying difficulties to students as they progress further in their education.&lt;ref name="macleodross" /&gt; They cautioned this could lead to a negative influence on students' future behaviors.&lt;ref name="macleodross" /&gt; Macleod and Ross wrote: "Playing devil's advocate is in itself a challenging notion for many learners, who may, especially in their early years of higher education, be conditioned by what Stewart and Cohen call 'lies to children' to expect simple and unambiguous questions and equally simple answers."&lt;ref name="macleodross"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Hamish|last1=Macleod|first2=Jenn|last2=Ross|title=Structure, Authority and Other Noncepts: Teaching in Fool-ish Spaces|journal=Digital Difference: Perspectives on Online Learning.|year=2011|publisher=Sense Publishers|pages=15–28|accessdate=28 February 2016|url=http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/13447040/Structure_Authority_and_Other_Noncepts.pdf|archivedate=28 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160228173510/http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/13447040/Structure_Authority_and_Other_Noncepts.pdf|doi=10.1007/978-94-6091-580-2_2|isbn=978-94-6091-580-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirsten Walsh and Adrian Currie contributed a 2015 article to the journal ''[[Metaphilosophy (journal)|Metaphilosophy]]'' in which they quoted the verbatim definition of lie-to-children from ''The Science of Discworld'' and discussed the impact of such behavior on students.&lt;ref name="walsh" /&gt; Walsh and Currie concluded that mythmaking within education in order to teach a more complex concept is a form of unwarranted behavior with detrimental impact upon instruction methodology.&lt;ref name="walsh" /&gt; In a 2015 article, ''[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]'' compared the concept to [[Wittgenstein's ladder]], and defined it: "that in order to get across a complicated idea, sometimes you need to use an explanation that is actually wrong but which helps a child – or anyone learning about anything complex – build an understanding of that issue."&lt;ref name="theconversation"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://theconversation.com/netanyahus-narrative-how-the-israeli-pm-is-rewriting-history-to-suit-himself-49759 | title=Netanyahu’s narrative: how the Israeli PM is rewriting history to suit himself | work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] | date=27 October 2015 | accessdate=4 February 2016|archivedate=28 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151028131940/http://theconversation.com/netanyahus-narrative-how-the-israeli-pm-is-rewriting-history-to-suit-himself-49759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2015, [[physics]] [[professor]] and [[science journalist]] [[Chad Orzel]] explained the concept: "Lies-to-children are not strictly true, but they’re simplified in a way that makes them easier to grasp for children, and provide a framework that allows for future elaboration."&lt;ref name="orzel"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2015/11/03/the-scientific-method-is-a-myth-long-live-the-scientific-method|accessdate=26 February 2016|work=[[Forbes]]|title='The Scientific Method' Is A Myth, Long Live The Scientific Method|first=Chad|last=Orzel|authorlink=Chad Orzel|date=3 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112005555/http://www.forbes.com/sites/chadorzel/2015/11/03/the-scientific-method-is-a-myth-long-live-the-scientific-method/|archivedate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orzel praised the [[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] initiative ''Understanding Science'' for its strategy of going beyond a simple explanation of the [[scientific method]] in a lie-to-children format, and instead going into more depth and specifics to directly inform others on how science impacts their daily quality of living.&lt;ref name="orzel" /&gt;

British writer [[Tim Worstall]] expounded upon the lie-to-children phenomenon in education, in a 2015 article for ''Forbes''.&lt;ref name="worstall" /&gt; He wrote: "that’s what Terry Pratchett pointed out education was: lies to children to help them make some sense of the world. When they become older, more capable of nuance, then we point this out to them: those previous stories were gross simplifications and now you need to know the caveats."&lt;ref name="worstall" /&gt; Worstall stressed that this form of educational methodology was ubiquitous across multiple academic disciplines: "This is true of any form of education by the way. We don’t start music classes with atonality, we start with simple scales. We don’t do syncopation until we’ve mastered 2/4 and 4/4. Einstein’s corrections at the margin to Newton come quite late in a physics education."&lt;ref name="worstall"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Worstall|authorlink=Tim Worstall|accessdate=28 February 2016|work=[[Forbes]]|title=To Prove Econ 101 Is Wrong You Do Need To Understand Econ 101|date=25 November 2015|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/11/25/to-prove-econ-101-is-wrong-you-do-need-to-understand-econ-101|archivedate=11 February 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211163351/http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2015/11/25/to-prove-econ-101-is-wrong-you-do-need-to-understand-econ-101/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''linguist''' in the academic sense is a person who studies [[natural language]] (an academic discipline known as [[linguistics]]). Ambiguously, the word is sometimes also used to refer to a [[Polyglot (person)|polyglot]] (one who knows several languages), or a grammarian (a scholar of [[grammar]]), but these two uses of the word are distinct (and one does not have to be a polyglot in order to be an academic linguist).&lt;ref&gt;The word ''linguistician'' has been coined to refer to one who studies linguistics, in order to avoid this ambiguity, although this word is vanishingly rare and has no currency in the field [http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/5/5-1147.html].&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a list of linguists in the academic sense.

'''The London School of Philosophy''' is an independent [[adult education]] college located in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. It offers part-time non-degree courses on a wide range of topics within [[philosophy]]. It was founded in 2010 by lecturers from Birkbeck College. It is based within [[Conway Hall]], in [[Bloomsbury]].

==History==

In 2009, the long-established School of Continuing Education at [[Birkbeck, University of London]], which specialised in [[extra-mural studies]], was abolished and its activities integrated into the main college. The following year, as part of this re-organisation, the number of part-time philosophy courses for adults was sharply reduced. Seven of Birkbeck's philosophy lecturers responded to the cancellation of their courses by meeting to establish a new college, the London School of Philosophy (LSP).&lt;ref name="LSP1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://londonschoolofphilosophy.org/ |title=Philosophy For the Capital |work=LSP website |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="ER1"&gt;{{cite |title=The London School of Philosophy at Conway Hall|work=Ethical Record (Vol.116 No.9, October 2011) |}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LSP's seven founders organised themselves on a cooperative basis and agreed a constitution in 2010. The first lectures took place in January 2011. A launch event was held on 6 September 2011.&lt;ref name="LSP2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://londonschoolofphilosophy.org/?page_id=477 |title=Launch Event |work=LSP website |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
In 2011 the London School of Philosophy announced a collaborative agreement with [[Conway Hall]] to base all its teaching activities there.&lt;ref name="PN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philosophynow.org/issue86/News_September_October_2011 |title=London’s first adult education college devoted entirely to philosophy |work=Philosophy Now (September/October 2011) |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Conway Hall is a large [[art-deco]] building on Red Lion Square in [[Bloomsbury]], built in 1929. It is the venue for a wide range of concerts, lectures and other cultural events.&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conwayhall.org.uk |title=Conway Hall |work=Conway Hall website |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The building also houses the Humanist Library,&lt;ref name="HL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conwayhall.org.uk/our-library |title=Library |work=Conway Hall website |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes a sizeable philosophy section.

==Courses==
Courses at the college cover topics such as ‘Philosophy and Theatre’, ‘Philosophy of Love’; ‘Existentialism’; and ‘Philosophy and Biology’ alongside others on ethics, aesthetics and the history of philosophy.

==Summer Schools==
In 2013 the London School of Philosophy for the first time entered a collaborative arrangement with [[Birkbeck,_University_of_London|Birkbeck]]'s Department of Philosophy and with Conway Hall, to offer a Summer School on philosophy, which was held over several days at the beginning of July.

The LSP's second annual Summer School, in 2014, was a collaboration with [[Heythrop College]] and Conway Hall. The speakers included Professor [[John Cottingham]], Professor [[Keith Ward]], Dr Anna Abram, Dr [[Piers Benn]], Dr [[Stephen Law]] and Dr Adam Stewart-Wallace (all from Heythrop), Dr Shahrar Ali, Dr Keith Barrett and Dr [[Anja Steinbauer]] (from London School of Philosophy) and special guest speakers Dr [[Roger Scruton]], Emeritus Professor [[Richard Norman]] (Kent) and Professor [[Ken Gemes]] (Birkbeck). &lt;ref name="LS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.londonschoolofphilosophy.org |title=LSP Summer School |work=LSP website |accessdate=2014-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==
[[File:Bertrand Russell and Conway Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1801595.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Bertrand Russell]] in front of Conway Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1801595]]
As the London School of Philosophy offers only part-time courses, student life is not centralised. The college does not offer [[halls of residence]]. At lunchtimes, LSP students often gather at the open-air Park Café in Red Lion Square Gardens.

== Overview ==
[[File:Margaret Gorman 4.jpg|thumb|175 px|Margaret Gorman, Miss America 1921]]

On February 1, 1919, there was a beauty pageant held in the Chu Chin Chow Ball at the Hotel des Artistes in [[New York City]]. The winner, [[Edith Hyde Robbins Macartney]], was called "Miss America." Neither the title nor this pageant were related to the current "Miss American Pageant" which would develop a year later in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=nyt1978&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/28/archives/obituary-3-no-title.html "Deaths: Macartney—Edith Hyde"].

''Golden Horrors: An Illustrated Critical Filmography of Terror Cinema, 1931-1939'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, the origins of the "Miss America Pageant" lie in an event entitled ''The Fall Frolic'' which was held on September 25, 1920, in Atlantic City. This event was designed to bring business to the Boardwalk: "three hundred and fifty gaily decorated rolling wicker chairs were pushed along the parade route. Three hundred and fifty men pushed the chairs. However, the main attractions were the young 'maidens' who sat in the rolling chairs, headed by a Miss Ernestine Cremona, who was dressed in a flowing white robe and represented 'Peace.'"&lt;ref name="early"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/missamerica/peopleevents/e_first.html|title=People &amp; Events: The First Miss America Beauty Pageant, 1921|publisher=[[PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was so successful that ''The Businessmen's League'' planned to repeat it the following year as a [[beauty pageant]] or a "bather's revue"&lt;ref name="early" /&gt; (to capitalize on the popularity of newspaper-based beauty contests that used photo submissions).&lt;ref name="early" /&gt; The event was scheduled to take place the week-end following Labor Day, to encourage summer visitors to stay in Atlantic City.

=== 1968–2016 ===
With the rise of [[second-wave feminism]] and the [[Civil and political rights|civil right]]s movement during the 1960s, the Miss America pageant became the subject of a series of protests that attacked it as sexist, racist, and part of U.S. militarism. The first demonstration took place during the [[Miss America 1969]] pageant held on September 7, 1968 (won by [[Miss Illinois]] 1968, [[Judith Ford]]), when about 200 members of the group [[New York Radical Women]] demonstrated as part of the [[Miss America protest]]. In addition, a pamphlet distributed at the protest by [[Robin Morgan]], ''No More Miss America!'', became a source for feminist scholarship.&lt;ref name="kim"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Feminist theory reader: Local and Global Perspectives| author=Carole R.

In Morgan papers, Duke University; see http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/wlmpc/&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan later stated that the Miss America pageant "was chosen as a target for a number of reasons: it has always been a lily-white, racist contest; the winner tours [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], entertaining the troops as a 'Murder Mascot'; the whole gimmick is one commercial shillgame to sell the sponsor's products. Where else could one find such a perfect combination of American values—racism, militarism, sexism—all packaged in one ‘ideal symbol,’ a woman."&lt;ref&gt;Robin Morgan, "The Oldest Front: On Freedom for Women," ''Liberation, an Independent Monthly'', Vol. 13, No. 5, October 1968, pg. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters compared the pageant to a county fair where livestock are judged.&lt;ref name=imagesnj&gt;{{cite web|url=http://officialnj350.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Miss-America.-Atlantic-City.-It-Happened-Here-New-Jersey.-Image-Credits.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150328231056/http://officialnj350.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Miss-America.-Atlantic-City.-It-Happened-Here-New-Jersey.-Image-Credits.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 28, 2015|title=It Happened Here in New Jersey: Miss America|accessdate=March 5, 2015|publisher=[[Kean University]] and the New Jersey Historical Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="68npr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94240375&amp;from=mobile|title=Pageant Protest Sparked Bra-Burning Myth|last=Greenfieldboyce|first=Nell|date=September 5, 2008|publisher= [[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They thus crowned a [[sheep]] as Miss America and symbolically destroyed a number of feminine products, including false eyelashes, high-heeled shoes, curlers, hairspray, makeup, [[girdle]]s, [[corset]]s, and [[bra]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Dow, Bonnie J. |title=Feminism, Miss America, and Media Mythology |journal=Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs |volume=6 |issue=1 |date= Spring 2003 |pages=127–149 |doi=10.1353/rap.2003.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burning the contents of a trash can was suggested, but a permit was unobtainable; news media seized on the similarity between [[Draft evasion#Vietnam War|draft resisters]] burning draft cards and women burning their bras.

===2017–present===
In late December 2017, [[HuffPost]] published an article exposing derogatory emails sent and received by CEO Sam Haskell, board members Tammy Haddad and Lynn Weidner, and lead writer Lewis Friedman. The emails, sent between 2014 and 2017, featured instances of expletive name-calling and unprofessional comments. The comments were often sexual or violent in nature and targeted former Miss America winners, notably [[Mallory Hagan]] and [[Katherine Shindle]], both of whom joined 47 other former Miss Americas (including all Miss Americas from 1988 to 2017)&lt;ref name="HuffPost followup"/&gt; in signing a joint open letter calling for the firing or resignation of all involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=HuffPost|title=The Miss America Emails: How The Pageant’s CEO Really Talks About The Winners|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/miss-america-ceo-emails_us_5a3bd266e4b025f99e153fdb|accessdate=22 December 2017|publisher=HuffPost}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 22, the Miss America Organization released statements to ''USA Today'', saying that it was made aware of concerns several months prior. They stated that the organization does not "condone the use of inappropriate language" and reported that its investigation had determined that Haskell was under "unreasonable distress resulting from intense attacks on his family from disgruntled stakeholders". The organization also reported that its relationship with Friedman had been terminated. Haskell explained that attacks on his character impaired his judgment when responding to the emails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=USA Today|title=Former Miss Americas slam pageant CEO Sam Haskell over offensive emails; pageant responds|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/12/22/former-miss-america-mallory-hagan-slams-disgraced-ceo-sam-haskell-following-email-scandal/976037001/|accessdate=22 December 2017|publisher=USAToday}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miss America's [[board of directors]] also suspended Haskell, who released a statement labeling the HuffPost article "unkind and untrue".&lt;ref name="HuffPost followup"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/miss-america-leadership-resign_us_5a3d3fdce4b025f99e16eca8|title=CEO Suspended After 49 Former Miss Americas Call On Organization's Leaders To Resign|last=Ali|first=Yashar|date=2017-12-22|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-st-miss-america-ceo-suspended-emails-unkind-20171222-story.html|title=Miss America CEO suspended over leaked emails revealed in story he calls 'unkind and untrue'|date=2017-12-22|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-12-23|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagan and Shindle criticized the decision to suspend Haskell, rather than fire him, as inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/america-winners-fear-pageant-ceo-suspension-article-1.3715705 |title=Ex-Miss America winners worry pageant will end despite CEO Sam Haskell's suspension |last=Dziemianowicz |first=Joe |last2=Dillon |first2=Nancy |date=2017-12-24 |publisher=''[[New York Daily News]]'' |access-date=2017-12-24 |last3=Bitette |first3=Nicole}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the President of Miss America, Josh Randle; executive chairwoman Lynn Weidner; and Haskell all resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/exclusive-president-of-miss-america-organization-resigns-amid-email-scandal_us_5a3e8dbce4b0b0e5a7a27c6e|title=Exclusive: President Of Miss America Organization Resigns Amid Scandal|last=Ali|first=Yashar|date=2017-12-23|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal prompted the pageant's producer, [[Dick Clark Productions]], to cut ties, and the [[Casino Reinvestment Development Authority]] (CRDA) announced that it was reconsidering its contract with Miss America, with its executive director Chris Howard describing the scandal as "troubling", and both Frank Gilliam, incoming mayor of Atlantic City, and State Senator [[Colin Bell (American politician)|Colin Bell]] called for CRDA to end its relationship with Miss America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/new_jersey/top-leader-suspended-at-miss-america-over-offensive-emails-20171222.html |title=Top leader suspended at Miss America over offensive emails |last=Moran |first=Robert |date=2017-12-22 |publisher=''[[The Inquirer]]'' |access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 24, Haddad also resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/12/24/miss-america-scandal-another-leader-steps-down-current-miss-america-speaks-out/979857001/ |title=Miss America scandal: Another leader resigns, former Miss America Mallory Hagan speaks out |last=Mallenbaum |first=Carly |date=2017-12-24 |publisher=''[[USA Today]]'' |access-date=2017-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, [[Gretchen Carlson]], who won the Miss America in 1989, was elected as the new chairwoman of the organization, becoming the first former Miss America to serve as its leader. [[Katherine Shindle]], [[Miss America 1998]], was also appointed to the board alongside fellow Miss America winners, [[Heather French Henry]] ([[Miss America 2000|2000]]) and [[Laura Kaeppeler]] ([[Miss America 2012|2012]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Ali |first = Yashir |date = 2018-01-01 |title = Exclusive: Gretchen Carlson To Serve As Board Chair Of Miss America Organization| publisher = [[HuffPost]] |url= https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gretchen-carlson-miss-america-board_us_5a4a9307e4b025f99e1cf274?ncid=inblnkushpmg00000009| access-date  = 2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move led to a number of changes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6417">The '''Mizzou Hydrogen Car Team''' designs, builds and competes with an Urban Concept [[Fuel cell vehicle|hydrogen fuel cell vehicle]] run by students at the [[University of Missouri]] in [[Columbia, Missouri]]. They recently competed with their vehicle named "Tigergen III" in the 2013 [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] [[Eco-marathon|Eco-Marathon]]. At the competition they achieved 8.8&amp;nbsp;mi/kWh which placed them 3rd in the UrbanConcept Hydrogen category.&lt;ref&gt;Releases, News and Media. [http://www.shell.com/home/content/ecomarathon/americas/media/event_highlights/2011/04172011_final.html "Winners for Shell Eco-marathon Americas 2011"], "Shell", April 17, 2011, accessed April 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The team also won an off-track award for "Best Team Spirit"

==About the Team==
[[File:Tigergen II team photo.jpg|thumb|right|Tigergen II team photo]]
[[File:Suntiger6 team photo.jpg|thumb|left|Suntiger 6 team photo]]

The team, located on the campus of the University of Missouri and run entirely by students, seeks to promote awareness of alternative fuels, develop technology, and allow members to gain practical experience through constructing a hydrogen vehicle. Advised by Professor Richard Whelove of the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, as well as Richard Wallace of the Electrical Engineering Department, the team was formerly known as the Mizzou Solar Car Team. The team switched over to hydrogen after 6 generations of solar cars. The team remains advised by Richard Whelove, alongside Michael Devaney of the Electrical Engineering Department.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Paul. [https://www.wired.com/autopia/2008/07/racing-to-canad/ "Racing to Canada in a Hydrogen Car"], "Wired", July 11, 2008, accessed March 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The team's first venture into hydrogen powered vehicles was with Tigergen I which ran on two 1.2&amp;nbsp;kW [[Ballard Power Systems|Ballard]] fuel cells and exhibitioned in the [[North American Solar Challenge]] as a demonstration vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Justin. [http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2008/07/02/mu-students-set-race-hydrogen-car/ "MU students set to race hydrogen car"], "Missourian", July 2, 2008, accessed March 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The team's second vehicle, Tigergen II, operated on a single 1.2&amp;nbsp;kW Ballard fuel cell and competed in the Urban Concept category of the Shell Eco Marathon, winning first place in the hydrogen category and fourth place overall in 2011. The team's current vehicle, Tigergen III, operates on two 1&amp;nbsp;kW Horizon fuel cells and competed Shell Eco Marathon Americas competition, placing third in the hydrogen UrbanConcept category.

==Current Technology==
The body and chassis of Tigergen III is integrated as a partial-load bearing system in a partial-[[monocoque]] design. This construction technique saves weight without compromising the structural integrity of the vehicle. To further reduce weight, Tigergen III's partial monocoque structure is composed entirely of composite materials. Carbon fiber and nomex material is used extensively throughout the car. Tigergen III uses Horizon hydrogen fuels cell to convert energy from hydrogen gas into electricity which is then used to power the vehicle's electric motor. Safety is a priority in Tigergen III. The driver is secured with a five-point racing safety harness along with the driver being separated from all components of the fuel system by a fire-resistant bulkhead and easy access to a fire extinguisher. Tigergen III competed in the 2012 and 2013 Shell Eco-Marathons.

==Objectives of the Race==
The purpose of the [http://www.shell.com/home/content/ecomarathon/americas/ Shell Eco Marathon] race is to drive as far as possible on the least amount of fuel. The competition is based on efficiency rather than speed and awards are given to teams that use the least amount of fuel while driving on a 6-mile circuit.  The Urban Concept category subjects vehicles to constraints that resemble those of a consumer vehicle such as brake lights, luggage space, and four wheels along with stop-and-go driving. The next competition takes place March 2012 at Discovery Green in Houston, TX.

The team competed for the first time with their vehicle named "Tigergen II" in the [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] [[Eco-marathon|Eco-Marathon]]  although it did not finish the race due to technical difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;Simonds, Ethan. [http://www.themaneater.com/stories/2010/4/6/mu-hydrogen-car-shows-potential-houston-race/ "MU hydrogen car shows potential in Houston race"], "The Maneater", April 6, 2010, accessed March 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The team was awarded a trophy and monetary prize for the "Perseverance in the Face of Adversity" as a result of the hard work they did to get the car working at the race.

===2011 Shell Eco Marathon===
In 2011 the team competed for the second time with Tigergen II with much greater success than before. Tigergen II completed all six
runs to receive six qualifying results. Run 2 experienced a technical problem but the fuel cell was rebooted and the run was completed. Of the six runs the highest efficiency obtained was on run "5" with 13.79&amp;nbsp;mi/kWh or 476 MPG. The team was awarded with First Prize for the Hydrogen Category in the Urban Concept Division. The team was also awarded a trophy and monetary prize for "Best Team Spirit"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3543">A '''national postgraduate representative body''' exists in many countries representing [[postgraduate]] students/researchers undertaking their [[doctorate]] ([[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]) or [[Postdoctoral researcher|postdoctoral research]]. Some have a broader remit to represent all postgraduates, including those taking [[Master's degree]]s. A few countries have no specific body but are represented by a national body representing all students, including [[undergraduates]].

In Europe many of the national organisations have come together under the federation [[Eurodoc]].

The '''Teachers' Federation of Puerto Rico''' ({{lang-es|Federación de Maestros de Puerto Rico}}, FMPR) is a [[trade union|union]] of [[teacher]]s in [[Puerto Rico]]. Its primary base is among employees of the [[Puerto Rico Department of Education]].

The FMPR was formed in 1960s by radical union activists. It currently has 32,000 members, making it one of the largest unions in Puerto Rico. The FMPR has recently disaffiliated from the [[American Federation of Teachers]]. A referendum within the union decided on a majority vote to disaffiliate with the AFT and the [[AFL-CIO]]. The details of the referendum were published on their website and the votes were counted by the teachers themselves according to official reports. The conflict between the two unions remained in limbo through January 2005, when hundreds of FMPR officers opposed to disaffiliation formally asked AFT to investigate the disaffiliation vote and the governing practices of President Feliciano. Though the AFT investigation alleged numerous  violations of the democratic rights of FMPR members, the whole matter of who controlled the FMPR wound up in court in Puerto Rico. FMPR prevailed in the court proceedings.

In April 2003 some of the union leadership including the president of the union were involved in [[Navy-Vieques protests#Further protests|violent]] protests which resulted in arrests and jail time for members of the union.

On February 21, 2008, the FMPR officially declared a strike.

Exactly nine days after it began, the FMPR declared the strike over.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31212">'''Ragging''' is the term used for the so-called "initiation ritual" practiced in higher education institutions in South Asian countries, including [[India]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The practice is similar to [[hazing]] in North America, [[bizutage]] in France, [[praxe]] in Portugal and other similar practices in educational institutions across the world. Ragging involves abuse, humiliation or harassment of new entrants or junior students by their seniors. It often takes a malignant form wherein the newcomers may be subjected to [[psychological torture|psychological]] or [[physical torture|physical]] torture.&lt;ref name=definition-ngo&gt;{{cite news

In 2009 the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] of India imposed regulations upon Indian universities to help curb ragging, and launched a [[Toll-free telephone number|toll-free]] 'anti-ragging helpline'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Report 2010-2011|url=http://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/6965381_Annual-2010-11.pdf|publisher=[[University Grants Commission (India)]]|accessdate=2 July 2016|page=29|quote=Section 1.3(j) Anti-Ragging Cell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==

Inception of ragging can be pleasant at first, hence the name 'Mal Samaya'. During this week or so, all newcomers are ordered to memorize the name and hometown of their peers. The objective of this exercise is said to be increasing the friendship among batch mates (locally termed as ''batch fit'').

==Dress code ragging==

The freshmen are asked to dress in a specific dress code for a particular period of time. The dress code prescribed is generally unusual, e.g. dressing completely in white or black with the hair oiled and combed in a particular style, dressing shirts that do not contain stripes, dressing long skirts for girls. Dress code ragging may make freshmen feel uncomfortable, as it often brings them unnecessary attention from everybody else.

==Verbal torture==

Verbal torture involves indulging in loose talks{{clarify|date=September 2017}}. The freshmen may be asked to sing the lyrics of any vulgar song or use abusive language in the presence of a large number of peers.  During this time, seniors assign an abusive and demeaning nickname, known as ''card'' to the juniors and they have to be called by that name throughout their entire university life. In some universities, this nickname is changed to a less vulgar name after the ragging period. These aliases are used primarily as a means of preventing the university authorities identifying the students who are involved in ragging and other unlawful activities. The form of verbal ragging differs from one institution to another. In some universities, students have to memorize poems made up of filth and recite them in front of others.

== Physical  torture ==
The freshers are asked to do various tasks, such as [[Sit-ups (punishment)|sit-ups]] or push-ups, sitting in the [[Murga punishment|murga]] pose, being forced to call seniors as sir, or removing their shirts. On an attempt to resist carrying out the activities, they may beat the fresher with baseball bats or slap them. 

Though, in India, if a complaint is lodged against that senior, they (and others who were present that time) will be given a strict punishment such as expulsion from university, imprisonment for a year etc.

== Academic performance ==
The seniors may attempt to harass or threaten the junior to complete their assignments, bunk classes, not to take part in any activities or be a part of clubs etc. 

Although, it comes under extreme cases of ragging and on complaint will lead to strict punishment to the seniors

==In India==

Highly reputed Indian colleges have a history of ragging especially medical colleges. It has become increasingly unpopular due to several complaints of serious injury to the victims and stringent laws pertaining to ragging. Ragging is now defined as an act that violates or is perceived to violate an individual student's dignity.&lt;ref name="toi"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharma|first1=Naresh|last2=Bodh|first2=Anand|title=Medical student killed in ragging|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Medical-student-killed-in-ragging/articleshow/4247603.cms|accessdate=9 November 2016|publisher=Times of India|date=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Supreme Court orders, a National [http://www.ugc.ac.in/page/helpline.aspx Anti-Ragging Helpline] was launched by the Indian government.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A high-level committee in 2009, which probed the death of Aman Kachroo, revealed that alcohol was the main reason leading to serious form of ragging and violence in the campus.

A report from 2007 highlights 42 instances of physical injury, and reports on ten deaths purportedly the result of ragging:&lt;ref name=india&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ragging has reportedly caused at least 30–31 deaths in the last seven years. In the 2007 session, approximately seven ragging deaths have been reported. In addition, a number of freshmen were severely traumatised to the extent that they were admitted to mental institutions.
Ragging in India commonly involves serious abuses and clear violations of human rights. Often media reports and others unearth that it goes on, in many institutions, in the infamous [[Abu Ghraib]] style:&lt;ref name=severity&gt;
{{cite news
| url = http://www.no2ragging.org/ragging.html
| title = The Terror Called Ragging
| publisher = Society Against Violence in Education (SAVE)
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on innocent victims.

However, the Anti-Ragging NGO, [[Society Against Violence in Education]] (SAVE) has supported that ragging is also widely and dangerously prevalent in engineering and other institutions, mainly in the hostels.

Following a Supreme Court Order, a National Anti-Ragging Helpline was created which helps the victims and take action in cases of ragging, by informing the head of the institution and the local police authorities of the ragging complaint from the college. The main feature of the helpline is that the complaints can be registered even without disclosing the name by the victim,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;https://antiragging.in/upload/Infopack/where_can_I_get_help.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; through email at helpline@antiragging.in, or through phone at 1800-180-5522.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://antiragging.in/home.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Ragging Helpline, and anonymous complaints===

India's National Anti-Ragging Helpline started working in June 2009 to help students in distress due to ragging. It consists of an email id and a 24-hour toll-free number. Provision for anonymous complaints was considered of utmost important at the time of establishment of the helpline, since the victim after making the complaint remains with or close to the culprits, away from a fully secure environment. Since many ragging deaths, like Aman Kachroo's,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-11-11/india/28233204_1_aman-kachroo-abhinav-verma-naveen-verma | work=The Times Of India | title=All four accused held guilty of ragging Aman Kachroo to death - The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; occurred due to seniors taking a revenge of the complaint made, anonymous complaints were equally allowed at the helpline.

As per UGC regulations, it is mandatory for a college to register an F.I.R. with police against the culprits if any violence, physical abuse, sexual harassment, confinement etc. takes place with any fresher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugc.ac.in/oldpdf/ragging/gazzetaug2010.pdf |title=UGC Anti-Ragging Regulation &amp;#124; &amp;#124; &amp;#124; See Point 7 |publisher=UGC |date=12 October 2009 |accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving any such complaint from the helpline, it becomes the duty of the head of the institution to register the F.I.R. with police within 24 hours. In 2013, a police case was registered against the director, dean and registrar of a reputed college in Delhi for, among other charges, not informing the police and registering F.I.R. within 24 hours of receiving the ragging complaint. (failing to inform a public authority, IPC 176).&lt;ref&gt;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:gp6NN4z278UJ:www.indianexpress.com/news/naveen-kujur-ragging-case-against-spa-for-negligence-and-tampering-with-evidence/1094641/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=in&amp;lr=lang_en%7Clang_hi&lt;/ref&gt;

The database of the Anti-Ragging Helpline indicates that it has been to an extent successful in ensuring a safer environment in colleges from where it registered the complaints. In many a cases though, it forwarded the complaint to the University Grants Commission (UGC) for an action against those colleges which refused to take any action against the culprits.

====Controversy====
A major concern that was highlighted against the helpline was that it registered a minuscule percentage (0.1%) of the total phone calls it received, and that meant it registered complaint in one out of one thousand calls it received. Specifically, the toll-free helpline (1800-180-5522) received {{formatnum:165297}} calls in the three months of November 2012 to January 2013, hence 77 calls an hour and at least a call a minute. But, only 190 complaints were registered in this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-17/news/37143957_1_nishat-israil-toll-free-helpline-rti-query | work=The Times Of India | title=UGC cell ignores complaints on ragging, registers just 1% - The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its defence, the helpline said that most of the calls it received were of inquiry in nature, of the eager students to know whether the helpline number worked or not. Many a times students changed their minds also midway not to register the complaint.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mid-day.com/news/2012/aug/090812-mumbai-Anti-ragging-helpline-1-6-lakh-dialled-but-only-1400-complained.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It also said that many of the calls were hoaxes as it was a toll-free number.

=== Legislation ===
In 1997, the state of [[Tamil Nadu]] first passed laws related to ragging. Subsequently, a
major boost to anti-ragging efforts was given by a landmark judgement of the [[Supreme Court of India]] in May 2001,&lt;ref name="SC2001Judgement"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927080951/http://www.noragging.com/laws/supreme-court-judgement.html Supreme Court of India Judgement 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; in response to a Public Interest Litigation filed by the Vishwa Jagriti Mission.

The Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD), following a directive by the Supreme court, appointed a seven-member panel headed by ex-[[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] director Dr. R. K. Raghavan to recommend anti-ragging measures.
The Raghavan Committee report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

submitted to the court in May 2007, includes a proposal to include ragging as a special section under the [[Indian Penal Code]]. The Supreme Court of India interim order&lt;ref name=SCMay2007&gt;
{{cite news
| url = http://courtnic.nic.in/supremecourt/temp/sc2429504p.txt
| title = Honbl. Supreme Court interim order on Ragging
| publisher = [[Supreme Court of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (based on the recommendations) dated 16 May 2007 makes it obligatory for academic institutions to file official [[First Information Report]]s with the police in any instance of a complaint of ragging. This would ensure that all cases would be formally investigated under
criminal justice system, and not by the academic institutions own ad-hoc bodies.

The Indian Supreme Court has taken a strong stand to prevent ragging. In 2006, the court directed the H.R.D. Ministry of the Govt. of India to form a panel which will suggest guidelines to control ragging.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The panel, headed by the former director of CBI Dr. R.K.Raghavan, met victims, guardians and others across the country. The Raghavan committee has placed its recommendation to the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which has given its order on the issue.&lt;ref name=SCMay2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

|publisher = [[CNN-IBN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welcoming the Supreme Court's recent judgment on ragging Dr. Raghavan, the former CBI director, who is the chairman, Monitoring Committee for the Prevention of Ragging, said, "there are finally signs that the recommendations to prevent ragging in colleges will be taken seriously."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/05/09/stories/2009050955561100.htm |title = R.K. Raghavan hails verdict &amp;#124 |publisher= Hindu.com |date=9 May 2009 |accessdate= 1 September 2010 |location= Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supreme Court in 2007 directed that all the higher educational institutions should include information about all the ragging incidents in their brochures/prospectus of admission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ugc.ac.in/soc_crei.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009 UGC Regulation ===

In 2009, in the wake of Aman Kachroo's death, University Grants Commission (UGC) passed UGC regulation on curbing the menace of ragging in higher educational institutions, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iitr.ac.in/news/uploads/File/academic/updatedraggingnotification.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These regulation mandate every college responsibilities to curb the menace of ragging, including strict pre-emptive measures, like lodging freshers in a separate hostel, surprise raids especially at nights by the anti-ragging squad and submission of affidavits by all senior students and their parents taking oath not to indulge in ragging.

Subsequently, UGC has made few amendments to the Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ugc.ac.in/page/Ragging-Related-Circulars.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; As per these,

# It is no longer required to get the verification of the affidavit done by an oath commissioner.
# The definition of ragging is updated as:
::- "Any act of physical or mental abuse (including bullying and exclusion) targeted at another student (fresher or otherwise) on the ground of colour, race, religion, caste, ethnicity, gender (including transgender), sexual orientation, appearance, nationality, regional origins, linguistic identity, place of birth, place of residence or economic background."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ugc.ac.in/pdfnews/7823260_Anti-Ragging-3rd-Amendment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-ragging movement ===
With the situation of ragging worsening yearly, there is emerging a spontaneous anti-ragging movement in India. Several voluntary organisations have emerged, who conduct drives for public awareness and arrange for support to victims.

Online groups like [[Coalition to Uproot Ragging from Education]] (CURE), Stopragging, No Ragging Foundation became the major anti-ragging groups on the Internet. Among them, the No Ragging Foundation has transformed into a complete NGO and got registered as [[Society Against Violence in Education]] (SAVE) which is India's first registered anti-ragging nonprofit organisation (NGO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.no2ragging.org/index.html |title=SAVE Homepage |publisher=www.no2ragging.org |date=1 January 1980 |accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org/pt/2007/04/884059.shtml |title=Independent Media Center |publisher=Indymedia.org |date= |accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups are working on issues related to ragging. Each of them is running anti-ragging websites and online groups.

The Indian media has been playing a crucial role by exposing ragging incidents and the indifference of many concerned institutions towards curbing the act. The Supreme Court of India has directed, in its interim judgement, that action may be taken even against negligent institutions.&lt;ref name=SCMay2007/&gt;

==In Sri Lanka==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}
Ragging is widely prevalent in [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://noragging.com/index.php/Research/Reports/Ragging-History-and-Evolution.html |title=Ragging: History and Evolution |publisher=[[Coalition to Uproot Ragging from Education]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618204928/http://noragging.com/index.php/Research/Reports/Ragging-History-and-Evolution.html |archive-date=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2007/07/01/main_Letters.asp |title=Stop murder by ragging! |publisher=[[Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka)]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091114193713/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2007/07/01/main_Letters.asp |archive-date=14 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no record to suggest that ragging is an indigenous phenomenon or was present in the ancient Sri Lankan educational institutions such as [[Mahavihara]] or [[Abhayagiri Vihara]]. It is widely considered to have been introduced during the post [[World War II]] era as a result of [[British Ceylon|British colonialism]] in Sri Lanka.{{ref label|a|a|none}} Sri Lankan soldiers returning from war re-entered the college educational system and brought with them the tradition and techniques of military style ragging. These techniques were used in the military as a mechanism of breaking down an individual so that success was achieved through team effort rather than personal goals or motivation. As fewer military persons entered the universities, ragging devolved into a violent and hazardous exercise that has been largely utilized for political purposes and thuggery.{{ref label|a|a|none}}

Ragging continues in most government universities and several private institutions with some efforts being made to contain the problem although there is hesitation from administrations to get involved. These efforts have been largely hindered by students themselves who consider ragging as a rite of passage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamilcanadian.com/page.php?cat=73&amp;id=1550 Indiscipline in Sri Lanka universities]&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of 'safe spaces' and travelling in larger groups are just some techniques employed by a growing movement of students trying to combat ragging. 
Traditionally, ragging would entail seniors mocking or jeering at freshers within a dedicated period of time – usually the first few months of an undergraduates university life. This period is known as the 'ragging period'. In Sri Lanka, several variations of ragging can be observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/06/24/fea02.asp Ragging and ‘teaching sessions’] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714201327/http://www.dailynews.lk/2009/06/24/fea02.asp |date=2009-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adverse consequences===

Ragging has been frequently associated with a broad spectrum of physical, behavioral, emotional and social problems among victims and is attributed to the increased risk of suicide and drop-outs among students attending Sri Lankan universities. Ragging at private universities and higher education institutes are at a minimum as compared to government universities which has prompted many students with financial means to enroll in private establishments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lankanewspapers.com/news/2007/2/12522_image_headline.html Anti- Ragging Bill will be strengthen - Wishwa Warnapala]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ragging is not merely a sociolegal problem and has a certain psychological basis too. Many senior students state they do not wish to rag juniors but succumb to peer pressure.

===Major incidents===

*In 1974, ragging of trainee mathematics teachers at the then [[University of Kelaniya|Vidyalankara University]] (now University of Kelaniya) prompted Prime Minister [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]]'s Government to appoint V. W. Kularatne Commission to probe the incident. As a result, 12 undergraduates were expelled and four officials were penalized for their failure to take appropriate action. This was the first major step taken against university ragging by a Sri Lankan government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.island.lk/2002/11/17/news10.html Death of V. W. Kularatne]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.island.lk/2003/11/13/opinio07.html V. W. Kularatne - J.P. U.M.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1975, [[University of Peradeniya]] reported the first ragging related death when a 22-year-old female student of the [[Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya|Faculty of Agriculture]], Rupa Rathnaseeli became paralyzed as a result of jumping from the second floor of the hostel "Ramanathan Hall" to escape the physical ragging carried out by her seniors. It was reported that she was about to be sexually penetrated by a foreign object as part of the ragging initiation – she jumped out of the hostel building to escape the abuse.&lt;ref name="thesundayleader"&gt;[http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2011/03/27/ragging-%E2%80%93-my-experience/ Ragging – My Experience] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217221753/http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2011/03/27/ragging-%E2%80%93-my-experience/ |date=2013-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rupa Rathnaseeli committed suicide in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.island.lk/2003/01/11//news01.html Rupa Rathnaseeli, forced to jump from the second floor of the 'Ramanathan']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal framework===

The human rights of citizens of Sri Lanka are protected in terms of the [[Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka]] which is the supreme law in the country. According to this Constitution, any citizen can produce a petition to the Supreme Court in terms of the article 126 of the Constitution in case of a human right violation or a case closer to the infringement. The Constitution further highlights ruthless, brutal or contemptuous treatment to any party by another as a violation of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2008/06/29/fea01.asp Legal framework on university ragging] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615174822/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2008/06/29/fea01.asp |date=2009-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; University students are also considered as citizens and are subjugated to the Common Law that prevails in the country. Accordingly, the constitutional constrains specified above are equally applicable to university students. Any form of civil or criminal offence executed by them are liable to be punished and in an instance of violation of such rights committed by university students, they shall be produced before the relevant court and subject to suitable punishment that followed by the trial. After the series of ragging-related incidents happened in 1997, ''Prohibition of Ragging and Other Forms of Violence in Educational Institutions Act, No. 20 of 1998''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonlii.org/lk/legis/num_act/poraofovieia20o1998797/ Prohibition Of Ragging And Other Forms Of Violence In Educational Institutions Act, No. 20 of 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; was passed in the Sri Lankan parliament. As specified in the detailed note of the Act, it is identified as an Act to eliminate ragging and other forms of violent and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment from educational institutions. The Act specifies the relevant Higher Educational Institutions coming under the Act and that includes all the Higher Educational Institutions established under the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978.

===Anti-ragging movement===

Unlike in [[India]], there is no official anti-ragging movement in Sri Lanka. But with the situation of ragging worsening yearly, there is a spontaneously emerging anti-ragging movement in each and every faculty of the universities that ragging exists.  In the case of [[University of Peradeniya]], the largest university in Sri Lanka, anti-ragging movement emerged in the year 1996. Prior to that, there was no movement against ragging, but certain individuals managed escape from the ragging. In the mean time, anti-ragging movements started to appear in all other universities. Several faculties in several universities have become rag-free due to these movements, strengthened laws as well as practical difficulties in conducting ragging such as not providing accommodation facilities to the first-year students.  Internal clashes have erupted several times due to the friction between ragging and anti-ragging movements, best example being Samantha Vithanage, a third-year management student at the [[University of Sri Jayewardenepura]], who pioneered an anti-ragging campaign that was killed at a meeting while in a discussion about ragging. The higher education minister at the time, [[S. B. Dissanayake]], stressed that firm action will be taken against those who are found guilty of such activities in future and would be expelled from the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2010/07/18/ragging-to-be-whipped/ Ragging To Be Whipped]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, he claimed that the levels of ragging has gone down drastically in the recent times and "only Peradeniya and Ruhuna are still affected by this 'malaise'".&lt;ref name="damlkn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailynews.lk/2011/12/16/news32.asp | title=Ragging in its death throes - SB | publisher=Daily News | date=December 16, 2011 | accessdate=January 2, 2012 | author=Abeyratne, Dharma Sri | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109014819/http://www.dailynews.lk/2011/12/16/news32.asp | archivedate=January 9, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3218">'''SEETEP''' stands for  Solar Energy and Environmental Education Program. It is a project being run in Mawere District located in the [[Nyanza Province]]  of Kenya. Its purpose is to build  a self-sustaining solar energy and water management school in the area by 2016.&lt;ref&gt;"About Seetep", http://seetep.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=13&amp;Itemid=4, Retrieved  2012-03-08,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conception==

Since 1992 [[Arc Aid and Arc Kenya|ARC-Aid and ARC-Kenya]] have been running their development programs in Kenya through offices based in Majiwe District at the ARO Development Centre.&lt;ref&gt;"ARO Development Centre", http://www.arc-aid.no/aro-development-centre/, Retrieved 2012-03-08&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to make the centre more environmentally sustainable a partnership agreement was struck with [https://web.archive.org/web/20120415011530/http://www.elkem.no/eway/default.aspx?pid=241 Elkem Solar]. Elkem installed solar panels in  ARO Development Centre which is  very close to the equator and thus in a prime position for Elkem to simultaneously  carry out research and development on the solar panels. The partnership was possible since both ARC-Aid and Elkem Solar are based in Kristiansand.

ARC-Aid has also entered a partnership with [http://www.kvadraturen.vgs.no/ Kvadraturen School](also in Kristiansand) which has an alternative energy department. Every year a teacher and some students from this department travel to Kenya to gain some practical experience on solar panel maintenance and installation. Elkem Solar later expanded its installation program and laid down solar panels in [https://www.google.no/search?aq=f&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=kisumu+polytechnic Kisumu Polytechnic] a technical school located in Nyanza. The interaction of these four partners led to the identification of a need for a school specialising in Solar Energy Technology and Water Resources Management. Elkem Solar would provide technical assistance to the school, Kvadraturen and Kisumu Polytechnic would develop the curriculum for the school while ARC-Aid and ARC-Kenya would coordinate the efforts of the different organisations.

[[Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation|NORAD]] is funding the project as part of their development activities. [http://www.vaf.no/hoved.aspx?m=8&amp;amid=59171 Vest-Agder County Municipality] has also pledged their support, donating funds and seeking other ways of involvement.

==Progress==

In 2010 the project officially began with the granting of funds by NORAD for a pilot project and the carrying out of feasibility research. The land on which the school will be built was acquired in 2011. The plot of land is located in Mawere District which is 100 kilometres from Kisumu. Construction has begun on the school using materials that have been developed in Kisumu Polytechnic.&lt;ref&gt;"Seetep Progress", http://seetep.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=7,Retrieved 2012-05-03&lt;/ref&gt; A delegation from Kisumu Polytechnic will be visiting Kristiansand in the month of May in order to discuss the way forward with Kvadraturen School and ARC-Aid.

'''''Scram: A Nuclear Power Plant Simulation''''' is an [[Atari 8-bit family]] game written by [[Chris Crawford (game designer)|Chris Crawford]] and published by [[Atari, Inc.]] in 1981.&lt;ref name="giantlist"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Giant List of Classic Game Programmers|url=http://dadgum.com/giantlist/|website=dadgum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves invoking a [[scram]], or emergency shutdown of a [[nuclear reactor]]. Written in [[Atari BASIC]], ''Scram'' uses [[differential equation]]s to simulate reactor behavior. The player controls the valves and switches of a nuclear reactor directly with the [[joystick]].

This game's title, SCRAM, is taken from the nuclear reactor safe-word conceived at the University of Chicago in 1942. It stands for "Start Cutting Right Away, Man", and it refers to cutting a reactor's control rods so they fall into the nuclear material and stop the reaction process.&lt;ref name="XXX"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atari 8-bit Ads |website=A Survey of Advertisements About the Atari 8-bit family of Computers |url=https://atari8bitads.blogspot.com/2016/05/late-closing.html |date=November 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also recreates the [[Three Mile Island]] Unit 2 nuclear reactor, and allowed players to recreate the events that took place there in 1979.&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Glenn|title=Gamephemera: SCRAM (Atari 400/800)|url=http://thenewgamer.com/content/archives/gamephemera_scram_atari_400_800|website=The New Games|date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The game display shows a [[schematic]]-like representation of a [[light water reactor]], typical of [[nuclear reactor]]s in use in the [[United States]] at that time. The reactor core is on the left of the screen, with the primary coolant loop to its immediate right. Further right is the secondary cooling loop, and finally the tertiary cooling loop and its associated [[cooling tower]].&lt;ref name="Turner" /&gt;

The user interacts with the game by moving the joystick, which makes a cursor jump from one "hot spot" to another on the screen, each one controlling one part of the reactor systems. There are hot spots for the [[control rod]]s, cooling pumps and valves. The user can experiment with the reactor systems by moving the joystick up and down, operating the equipment. It is possible to simulate a [[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]] by shutting off the primary cooling pumps and withdrawing the control rods all the way.

The game has several skill levels, which control the frequency of earthquakes and the obviousness of the damage. In the event of an earthquake the screen shakes, and a breaking sound is heard if there is damage. The user then has to watch the on-screen displays to try to isolate where the problem is.

==Reception==
''[[Softline (magazine)|Softline]]'' in 1981 criticized the documentation, calling it "needlessly wordy and confusing".&lt;ref name="bang198111"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1981&amp;pub=6&amp;id=2 | title=SCRAM | work=Softline | date=November 1981 | accessdate=13 July 2014 | author=Bang, Derek | pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59032">The '''Secret Court of 1920''' was an ad hoc disciplinary tribunal of five administrators at [[Harvard University]] formed to investigate charges of homosexual activity among the student population. During two weeks in May and June 1920, the Court – headed by Acting Dean [[Chester Noyes Greenough]] – conducted more than thirty interviews behind closed doors and took action against eight students, a recent graduate, and an assistant professor. They were expelled or had their association with the university severed. Two of the students were later readmitted. The affair went unreported until 2002.

==Suicide of Cyril Wilcox==
On May 13, 1920, Cyril Wilcox, a Harvard undergraduate, completed suicide by inhaling gas in his parents' house in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]]. Newspaper reports called the death accidental. At the time Wilcox had been warned about his poor academic performance and had withdrawn from school for reasons of health. The night before his death, Wilcox had confessed to his older brother, George Lester Wilcox, himself a graduate of Harvard, that he had been having an affair with Harry Dreyfus, an older Boston man.

George, shortly after his brother's death, intercepted two letters to Cyril, one from Ernest Roberts, a Harvard student, and another from Harold Saxton, a recent graduate. Their candid and detailed gossip convinced him that Harvard was harboring a network of homosexual students. On May 22, George Wilcox located Dreyfus, extracted from him the names of three other men involved, and beat him. Later that day, he met with Harvard's Acting Dean Greenough and shared what he knew: his brother's admission, the contents of the letters, and what Dreyfus had told him.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Part I; Wright, 9-25. The ''Crimson'' article identifies Cyril's older brother as "George." Wright calls him "Lester." Cyril's father was named "George Thomas Wilcox" (Wright, 10), and Cyril's brother was named "George Lester Wilcox". See also: Frederick Sumner Mead, ''Harvard's Military Record in the World War'' (Boston: Harvard Alumni Association, 1921), 1024, which details the military service record (1917-19) of George Lester Wilcox of the Harvard class of 1914; ''Harvard Alumni Directory'' (Boston: Harvard Alumni Association, 1919), 769. Wright says that Dreyfus provided a list of "some ten names," while Paley says 3, specifically Roberts, Eugene Cummings (a dentistry student), and Pat Courtney (a boy from Boston). Wright 24, Paley, Part I.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harvard's response==

===Formation===
[[File:Theyard.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Harvard Yard in 1905]]
Greenough promptly consulted with Harvard President [[Abbott Lawrence Lowell]] and the decision was made to obviate the normal and relatively slow-moving student disciplinary process before the Administrative Board made up of faculty members and the Dean. Instead, on May 23, 1920, just a day after listening to Wilcox, Greenough formed a special five-man [[tribunal]] which has come to be called the "Secret Court," because its files were stored under that name in the University Archives. The participants themselves called it "The Court" to distinguish it from the usual Administrative Board. The unspecific name also disguised the subject of its investigations.

Acting Dean Greenough was to head the Court. Another senior member was Professor of Hygiene Robert I. Lee, the doctor responsible for the students' annual physical examinations, who had experience posing intimate questions about sexual activity. A third was Regent Matthew Luce, whose responsibilities included student discipline and conduct, especially housing and dormitory proctors. They were all roughly forty years old or more. Two young Assistant Deans, Edward R. Gay and Kenneth Murdock, both just a little older than the undergraduates, filled out the Court's membership. The Court reported to President Lowell, and his rulings were final.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Part I; Wright, 28-30&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point Greenough could identify Roberts, the author of one of the letters to Cyril Wilcox, as the principal target of his inquiry. The same day the Dean formed the Court, he spoke to a graduate student in business, Windsor Hosmer. He expected Hosmer, as proctor of Perkins Hall, to be a source for information about Roberts, but he proved unhelpful, either because he was an inattentive proctor or because he preferred not to be candid. He told the Dean he knew that Roberts hosted parties, but caused no disturbance and broke no rules. He was given three days to monitor visits to Roberts' room and report both current and past visitors. On May 26, Hosmer gave Greenough a list beginning with Roberts himself, followed by the names of Kenneth Day and Keith Smerage, noted as frequent visitors, then Eugene Cummings and Nathaniel Wolff, and then two more of whom he was "inclined to think that neither is part of the group that has centered around Perkins." A few days later, Hosmer returned to report that the last two boys had objected to his inclusion of their names.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, 46-7, 50-51; Paley, Part I. Paley's report of the contents of the list differs. He says Say in place of Smerage and omits Wolff. With respect to Hosmer's role, Perkins Hall is actually a complex with 4 entrances.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First anonymous letter===
An unsigned, typed letter dated May 26 now confirmed and enlarged upon what Greenough had learned from George Wilcox. It probably reached the Dean just as the Court began interviewing students. The author, identifying himself as a Harvard College junior, described how Cyril Wilcox in his first year fell in with a set of his classmates who "committed upon him and induced him to commit upon them 'Unnatural Acts'" and when he determined he lacked the "strength of character" to stop participating in such activity he completed suicide. Roberts was "the leader of this group and directly responsible" for the suicide, he continued:

{{quote|Roberts rooms at Perkins 28 where he and more of his type have, during the past year, conducted "parties" that beggar description and how in the World such parties "got by" the Proctor is quite beyond me. At these parties were sailors in uniform whom Roberts and friends of his type picked up in the streets of Boston and used for his dirty immoral purposes. At the parties were notorious young male degenerates such as Harold Hussey, and Ned Courtney and many others of the type and many of them dressed in womans [sic] clothes which they brought with them and appeared in public hallways and entrys [sic] of Perkins so dressed.}}

Then he named as regular participants three students—Kenneth Day, Edward Say and Eugene Cummings—as well as the tutor Saxton, who was already known to Greenough. He pressed home his point by describing the parties where "the most disgusting and disgraceful and revolting acts of degeneracy and depravity took place openly in plain view of all present." Finally he urged the Dean on with a rhetorical question: "Isn't it about time an end was put to this sort of thing in college?"&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Part I; Wright 47-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation===
The Court began its interrogations on May 27, 1920. Dean Greenough summoned each witness with a brief note, for example: "I expect you, whatever your engagement may be, to appear at my office tomorrow, Friday, May 28th, at 2:45 P.M."&lt;ref name="Paley, Part I"&gt;Paley, Part I&lt;/ref&gt; Another even said: "If necessary you are directed to cut a final examination in order to keep this appointment."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, 114&lt;/ref&gt; Only the Court's notes survive, not transcripts, so it is difficult to ascertain the tenor of the exchanges, whether these were conversations, interviews, or interrogations, or perhaps changed in the course of each session. Clearly the Court pressed witnesses and challenged them with conflicting facts, since the Court's notes record admissions followed by attempts to recant, as well as denials followed by admissions. For example, the Court's note for Harold Saxton says "when pushed he practically confessed to one act, but later retracted." And Kenneth Day "confessed to H.S. [homosexual] relations with Roberts, after denial at first."&lt;ref name="Paley, Part I"/&gt;

Many of those interrogated were never charged and have not been identified. That suggests that the Court, despite its secrecy, was prepared to reveal its mission to innocent students as it attempted to identify those more closely involved. As the Court proceeded, it had increasing amounts of information to use to question witnesses and challenge their statements. Some were called back for follow-up questioning. Nor did the Court restrict itself to people with a Harvard affiliation. At least two witnesses lacking a Harvard connection responded to its summons, though it is unclear whether they participated voluntarily or under some threat. One was Ned Courtney, a Boston boy whose name was mentioned in testimony as the "main annoyance" for his frequent telephone calls to Perkins. Another was Harry Dreyfus, who was connected through his relationship with Cyril Wilcox and his employment at the Café Dreyfus, a known homosexual gathering place.

No subject was too personal for the Court's inquiry. It posed questions about masturbation practices and engaging in sexual acts with women or men, cross-dressing and entertaining overnight guests. Less intrusive questions addressed friends and associates, parties attended and what was seen and who was present, reading habits and familiarity with homosexuality, theories about it as well as slang used to describe its practitioners and their activities ("faggoty parties," "tricks"). Soon the Court had a list of business establishments to inquire about as well, starting with the Café Dreyfus and adding The Lighted Lamp, The Golden Rooster, and Green Shutters.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, I and II. Wright reconstructs and dramatizes the interviews from the Courts' notes, so his accounts must be read with care. See esp. 96-7. Open questions include the sequence of the interviews, who posed the questions, the time between the interview and the recording of the notes, and the completeness of the notes. Paley (Part I) refers to "the sparse dates marked in the secret records."&lt;/ref&gt;

Many witnesses found it difficult to lie effectively when the Court already had enough circumstantial evidence to use in probing their answers. Others may have decided that the best course was to answer honestly or with relatively honest answers that minimized their involvement. The Court's notes say that Kenneth Day "admits he is probably a little tainted. Mind poisoned." Ernest Roberts claimed he was "led astray" by Cyril Wilcox and that Kenneth Day, too, had been "led into it by Wilcox–but not of his own free will." Joseph Lumbard described parties where men danced together and others dressed in women's clothes. The Court noted: "some kissing witnessed." Asked why he did not leave such a party, he allowed that he "stayed because he was interested." He had not masturbated for 6 years. Nathaniel Wolff detailed mutual masturbation with Keith Smerage, but claimed to have ended such behavior. "He was fighting hard and felt that he had overcome the habit. Says he is 90% OK." Keith Smerage in turn said he had not masturbated in 9 months and in college "had not slept with men in the unnatural sense." Later the Court recorded that he said he had "'fooled' around with the homosexual business" once or twice at Harvard. Stanley Gilkey defended reading [[Havelock Ellis]]: "I think a man should know everything." Assistant Professor of Philosophy Donald Clark "denied any connection with homosexualism, and he denied talking about it except to help some students to cure themselves." He later admitted to have propositioned a student, as the Court already knew from an earlier interview with the object of Clark's attentions.&lt;ref name="Paley, Part I"/&gt;

===Disposition of cases===
The Court punished ten it found guilty of some offense and the punishments varied with their status and their degree of culpability. It expelled seven College students (Day, Gilkey, Lumbard, Roberts, Say, Smerage, Wolff) and one student in dentistry (Cummings). Four (Day, Gilkey, Lumbard, Wolff) were invited to reapply to Harvard in a year or two. The Court also told those expelled to leave Cambridge promptly and complained to the families of those who did not move quickly. All were told that Harvard would reply frankly to requests for recommendations or for explanations for their separation from the school. Refusing to provide a positive reference was all the Court could do to Saxon, the tutor, and Clark, the young professor. It identified four others unconnected to Harvard as "guilty" but could not directly punish them. It would try to see that one would lose his job as a waiter at the Café Dreyfus.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Part II; Wright, 165, 167. Wright, 137, provides different counts. He inexplicably omits Smerage and does not specify whom he counts as not affiliated with Harvard.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean Greenough also ordered a letter placed in the files of those it punished to prevent the college's Alumni Placement Service from "making any statement that would indicate confidence in these men." The Placement Service proved efficient in following those instructions. Lumbard found himself blocked by negative responses from Harvard when he applied to [[Amherst College|Amherst]], the [[University of Virginia]], and [[Brown University|Brown]]. Dean Otis Randall of Brown even replied sympathetically to praise Harvard's actions: "I feel your action in the matter was wise and just and that you deserve the support of the colleges to which young Lumbard may make application. How frequently we uncover messes of this sort, and how disagreeable it is to deal with such matters." Wolff was treated similarly when applying to [[McGill University|McGill]]. The Placement Office's standard reply said "Harvard cannot show any confidence in this individual." To a request for Saxon's credentials it spoke of "moral turpitude."&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Part II, Wright, 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court warned the students not to delay contacting their families because the Court was going to write them promptly. Dean Greenough wrote to Roberts: "The letter that I am sending to your father this morning, although it does not tell him everything, necessitates your telling him everything." To Kenneth Day he wrote: "It would be better for them to hear it from you than from me." The Dean's letters about students who had committed no overt act explained the circumstances at length and provided the Court's rationale for expulsion in such cases: "The acts in question are so unspeakably gross that the intimates of those who commit these acts become tainted." He made a clear distinction by not criticizing such a student's character, but his judgment, calling him "no worse than ignorant, over-curious, and careless." When it came to those who had engaged in homosexual sex, Greenough withheld details yet tried to underscore the significance of the violation. To Roberts' father, Greenough wrote that his son "has promised to tell you all about the matter, and I hope he will tell you the whole truth. His offense has nothing to do with low scholarship; it is not gambling, or drink or &lt;u&gt;ordinary&lt;/u&gt; sexual intercourse. If he does not confess to something worse than these things, he will not have told you the whole story."&lt;ref&gt;Panit, Part II; Wright, 154, 163&lt;/ref&gt;

The students' parents were troubled, supportive, and forgiving. Responses to Greenough, while always respectful, varied from pleading to polite challenges to the Court's judgment. Lumbard's father protested his son's "extremely unjust treatment."&lt;ref name="Paley, Part II"&gt;Paley, Part II&lt;/ref&gt; Gilkey's father hoped his son would be readmitted to erase the impact of a "penalty out of proportion to his delinquency,"&lt;ref&gt;Wright, 205-6&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts' father noted  "how this dreadful news has upset me" and sought assurances from Greenough that his son had terminated his "evil practices" some months before.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, 155-6&lt;/ref&gt; Others engaged in protracted correspondence and had employers send testimonials. In Day's case, since he was an orphan, his cousin undertook a long correspondence detailing his cousin's work habits and social contacts.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, 163ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Say's father, a Connecticut grocer, asked to see the evidence against his son, and Greenough replied that he could not send "the great mass of evidence" through the mail, though the actual evidence against Say consisted of a few sentences of testimony that mentioned him. Say's mother wrote as well and indicated she felt that others of greater means like Lumbard were not being treated as harshly as her son: "My son's father is not a doctor, but he is a good, honest working father."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, 203-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Smerage's mother learned of her son's expulsion when she opened Greenough's letter and the next day initiated a yearlong series of letters on his behalf. She spoke of her "stricken home" and her son's history of illness. Ultimately, she questioned the Court's entire approach: "I feel now that you men could have done much good had you perhaps had a little less sense of justice and a little more of the spirit of Jesus in your hearts."&lt;ref&gt;Smerage himself advised another approach. As an alternative to expulsion, he suggested that a "word of warning, a helping hand, without the 'jolt' of ruining their life careers, could help them out." Paley, Part II; Wight 187ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolff's father asked the Dean to recognize that helping his son to reform was more important than punishment: "I am taking the liberty of appealing to you, not in your official capacity, but as a man, to do what you can to assist him. You know all are subject to mistakes, and the blessing is in those who can aid and advise in correcting and saving rather than otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, 215-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court told four students to consider applying for admission in a year or more. Initially Lowell opposed all such applications. Greenough expressed frustration with his stance and eventually won readmission for Gilkey and Lumbard. He expressed especial frustration that Lowell would not readmit Day. Informing Day that he could not return to Harvard, Greenough could only offer personal reflections and assurances: "Two points, however, I beg you to bear in mind. First, the chief thing in this world is to do right and be of service, whether at Harvard or outside. I know that you will keep on trying wherever you are. Secondly, please remember that if there is ever anything I can personally do to help you, I shall be glad to know it and to do it."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, 169-70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Part II, says 3 were readmitted, including Wolff. Wright quotes from correspondence between Greenough and Wolff's father that makes it clear Wolff will not be readmitted, and Wolff's name does not appear in alumni directories.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public awareness===
[[File:North Main Street, Fall River, MA.jpg|250px|thumb|right|North Main Street, Fall River, MA, circa 1910]]
Given the number of interviews, and the consequent expulsions, the undergraduate population must have become aware of the Court's work in a matter of days. Yet the Court's work escaped public attention. At least twice the Court was told that Ernest Weeks was threatening to make public his opposition to the Court and its methods, but nothing came of that. The Court itself in its communications with the students' parents and guardians gave assurances that "Every effort has been made to prevent any knowledge of this affair from becoming public."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ??&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet a few students must have spoken with a reporter. On June 19, the ''[[Boston American]]'' ran a news story that connected the few public facts: two Harvard students, friends, both from [[Fall River, Massachusetts]], had died within a month of one another: Cyril Wilcox "accidentally killed by gas" at home on May 13 and dentistry student Eugene Cummings a suicide in the infirmary on June 11. Cummings, the story went on, had told friends about "an alleged inquisition, which he claimed was held in the college following Wilcox' death." He had been taken to a room "shrouded in gloom" and "questioned exhaustively." College authorities denied his story and said it was the product of his "disordered mind." Finally, Court member Dr Roger I. Lee put an end to further inquiries. Cummings, he told the ''Boston American'', "had been acting in a queer manner," using an adjective that indicated Cummings' underlying condition was not fit for public discussion. Contemporary press coverage ended with that one article.&lt;ref&gt;''Boston American'', June 19, 1920. Wright's book contains a readable reproduction of the paper's front page. Also Paley, Part II. Academic difficulties were a plausible explanation for suicide. ''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1911/06/28/archives/harvard-man-a-suicide-ae-smith-had-failed-to-take-his-ba-degree.html "Harvard Man a Suicide," June 28, 1911], accessed December 22, 2009. A student killed himself in Perkins Hall "owing, it is thought, to failure to receive his degree of Bachelor of Arts with his class." Also ''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1908/02/04/archives/harvard-man-tries-suicide-rs-minot-jr-worries-over-studies-and.html "Harvard Man Tries Suicide," February 4, 1908], accessed December 22, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second anonymous letter===
A second anonymous letter reached the Court as it concluded its work. The author upbraided the Court for failing to identify "most, if not all" of those students guilty of homosexual activity. The Court, according to the author, mishandled its investigation by concentrating on the Roberts group, which encompassed only half of the 50 students the Court should have identified. The others disliked the Roberts set and had "little cliques of their own." They now "continued their practices within the student body and continued spreading it." The letter also said that the Court's methods, such as the grilling Cummings described and using expulsion as its consistent punishment, were not well considered. It argued that offering more lenient treatment like "probation, etc." in return for additional names of associates would have accomplished more. The identity of the letter's author remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Wright p. 159-62. Smerage made a comparable point about what the Court missed when he wrote Greenough that he was "sore at being one of eight expelled when I am one of at least ten times as many."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court took no action in response to this critique. On commencement day, June 22, less than 4 weeks after the Court began interviewing students, the senior class exercises in [[Sanders Theatre]] were followed by another ceremony at the [[Harvard Stadium|stadium]]. "The usual spreads and dances at clubs and fraternity houses were arranged....Rain fell at frequent intervals during the evening, putting a damper on the outdoor program."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1920/06/23/archives/harvard-holds-class-day-old-graduates-also-join-livelier-features.html "Harvard Holds Class Day," June 23, 1970], accessed December 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, in a somewhat different context, Dean Greenough claimed the Court did all it could with the evidence it extracted from its witnesses. Grace Smerage, the mother of expelled student Keith Smerage, had complained to Greenough that Harvard had just graduated others her son said were as guilty as he or more so. Greenough replied on behalf of the Court: "We certainly cannot be held responsible for not acting on evidence we did not possess, especially when we have asked all the boys we have summoned if they had anything further to tell us. If boys choose to shield those who are guilty they must accept the incomplete results of a Board acting upon information which is inadequate because the boys themselves have chosen to let it be inadequate."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, 195&lt;/ref&gt;

Though a college administrator at the time of the Court, he only received his Harvard diploma magna cum laude in 1922. Following his years at Harvard, he worked as a newspaper copy editor and then embarked on a distinguished business career in the paper industry, ending as Vice Chairman of the Board of [[St. Regis Paper Company]].

'''[[Roger I. Lee]]''' was head of the Department of Hygiene. As doctor to the students, he conducted their annual physical examinations. He was born in 1881 and at Harvard he earned his bachelor's degree in 1902 and medical degree in 1905. He served as a lieutenant-colonel in the Medical Corps in [[World War I]]. Upon his return from service he authored ''Health and Disease: Their Determining Factors''.&lt;ref&gt;His discussion of "Sex Perversions" is limited to masturbation. It dispels myths and asserts that "It is actually questionable how much actual harm masturbation itself causes....[T]he habit and its attendant train of evils usually disappear after simple explanations." Homosexuality is not mentioned. He advises rigorous adherence to factual information in sex education and emphasizes the importance of education tailored to the individual. Lee, 263-70.&lt;/ref&gt; As a reaction to the discovery that so many [[World War I]] recruits were unfit for service, he initiated at Harvard one of the first collegiate fitness programs in 1919. He was Professor of Hygiene from 1914 to 1924 and later served as a member of the [[President and Fellows of Harvard College|Harvard Corporation]] from 1931 to 1954. He played a prominent role in several medical organizations, notably as President of the [[American Medical Association]] in 1945-46. He retired from the practice of medicine at 80 and died October 29, 1965 at the age of 84.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0B10FA3E5D1A728DDDAD0994DA405B848EF1D3&amp; "Dr. Lee to Leave Harvard," February 14, 1924], accessed December 19, 2009; ''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1931/05/22/archives/quit-harvard-corporation-bishop-lawrence-and-jf-moors-replaced-by.html "Quit Harvard Corporation," May 22, 1931], accessed December 19, 2009; ''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1965/10/30/archives/dr-rooerlei-84-exhejd-oflma-retired-diagnostician-dies-taught-at.html "Dr. Roger Lee, 84, Ex-Head of A.M.A," October 30, 1965], accessed December 19, 2009; Wright, 14-5, 29.

'''[[Abbott Lawrence Lowell]]''' was in his tenth year as President of the University. He was born in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] in 1856, the scion of a famous family. He graduated from Harvard College ''cum laude'' in 1877 and from Harvard Law School in 1880. After practicing law, he taught at Harvard and in 1909 began his 24-year tenure as President of Harvard University. An educational reformer, he implemented a new set of academic requirements for Harvard undergraduates that required them to concentrate in a particular discipline beginning in 1914. He established a distinctive profile as a defender of academic freedom in the years during and after World War I. His tenure was marked by controversies about his proposed establishment of a quota to limit the admission of Jewish students and his attempt to exclude African American students from residing in the Freshman Halls. He implemented [[Harvard College#House system|Harvard College's residential house]] system in 1930 and retired in 1933. He died in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1943/01/07/archives/a-l-lowell-dies-harvardexhead-president-of-university-19091933.html "A. L.

'''Matthew Luce''' was Harvard's Regent in 1920, the administrative officer charged with responsibility for the welfare and conduct of the student population. He supervised residence hall proctors and student organizations. He was a Harvard graduate from the class of 1891. During [[World War I]] he served as assistant secretary of the Massachusetts Food Administration. When appointed Regent in 1919, he worked at a firm of wool dealers, Luce and Manning, and was a trustee of the [[Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]]. He served as Regent until his resignation in 1935. Upon his resignation, the ''Harvard Crimson'' described him as "obscure by preference and by the nature of his functions, and an officer of the University unknown to students who followed the relatively straight and narrow path....Since he acted as an intermediary without disciplinary authority, his office was largely what he himself wanted to make it, and he considered it a roving commission to pour oil on troubled waters."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, 29; ''Harvard Crimson'': [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1919/1/20/luce-91-appointed-regent-pthe-appointment/ "Luce '91 Appointed Regent," January 20, 1919], accessed December 19, 2009; ''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1935/07/01/archives/resigns-as-harvard-regent.html "Resigns as Harvard Regent," July 1, 1935], accessed December 20, 2009; ''Harvard Crimson'': [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1935/10/4/office-of-regent-passes-with-resignation/ "Office of Regent Passes With Resignation of Matthew Luce," October 4, 1935], accessed December 19, 2009. His earlier attempt to resign failed. The ''Crimson'' reported: "Regent Luce...gave as the reason for his resignation the fact that he was no longer necessary and that his office is no more than a title. 'While the student body at one time was boisterous and hard to handle, for some years they have been docile and amendable to University regulation The days when pistols were fired up chimneys, when statues were painted, when free speech was exercised, are now no more.... We of this office are only human and sometimes wish that someone would play with a fire extinguisher or do something spectacular in order that ancient and long-standing statues might be put to use. We have hoped in vain, and in fear of premature age through inactivity I have resigned.' He said that the present staff of Yard Cops would not retire with him, but since they were ageing [sic] fast would be retained for sentiment's sake."

'''Kenneth Murdock''' was an Assistant Dean of Harvard College. A Boston native, he was just 25 years old at the time of the Court. He graduated from Harvard ''summa cum laude'' in 1916 and then served in [[World War I]] as an ensign in the Navy. He then returned to the college as Assistant Dean, while his father, a successful banker, was serving on a committee that was reorganizing the University's finances. He later earned his doctorate in English from Harvard and enjoyed a distinguished academic career as Francis Lee Higginson Professor of English Literature, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (1931–36), and the first Master of [[Leverett House]] (1930–41). Among his many publications were ''Literature &amp; Theology in Colonial New England'' and ''The Notebooks of Henry James'', which he edited with [[F. O. Matthiessen|F.O. Matthiessen]].

==Witnesses and other parties==
[[File:HarvardYard.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Harvard Yard]], in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in 2005]]
'''Donald Clark''' was a 24-year-old graduate of [[Wesleyan University]], an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Harvard, and a Ph.D. candidate there. Fluent in Italian, German and French, he served during [[World War I]] as a special agent in the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]. He received a master's degree in Philosophy from Harvard in 1918 and was in the third year of his Ph.D. program when the Court summoned him for an interview after a student claimed to have been propositioned by Clark. As a mark of the Court's profound concern about Clark's status as an instructor, Harvard President Lowell attended his interrogation. Clark confessed to having homosexual sex on a number of occasions. The Court told him he would have to withdraw from the Ph.D. program and would not be reappointed to his teaching position. He was expected to finish grading examinations. Later President Lowell crossed Clark's name off all school records.&lt;ref name="Paley, Part I"/&gt; Clark taught for a while at [[Mills College]] and at the [[Mannes College The New School for Music|David Mannes School of Music]], published a book of poetry and translations from Italian and German. He worked as a librarian at the [[National Jewish Hospital]] in Denver until his death from tuberculosis at age forty-seven in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Parts I and II; Wright, 98-9, 212-14&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ned Courtney''' had no relationship with Harvard. He worked as a waiter at the Café Dreyfus and probably had sex with several Harvard students. Nevertheless he responded to the Court's summons and submitted to its questioning. The Court's notes indicate that Harvard would do what it could to terminate his employment.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Part I; Wright, 57-8, 122-3. Another name of a local boy involved with the Harvard students was Harold Hussey. It may have been a pseudonym taken from the name of a character in a story published in 1916. Freeman Tilden, "Knowledge is Power" in ''[[Munsey's Magazine]]'', vol. 57 (1916), 653ff. Harold Hussey is a delicate boy with "manicured nails and a slight lisp," a "shrimp" who "hasn't got the nerve of a chipmunk." Other names that appear in the Court's records are Pat Courtney, William Toomey and "Win" Adams.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eugene R. Cummings''' was a 23-year-old student just three weeks from completing a program in dentistry. He was an active homosexual and thoroughly embedded in the group of students the Court was targeting. Soon after he faced the Court's questioning, he became ill and checked himself into Harvard's Stillman Infirmary. A few days later, on June 11, before being notified that he was expelled,&lt;ref&gt;Wright assumes that the Court ended each interrogation by stating its judgment and punishment, because the Court's determination is written at the end of its interview notes. Paley makes no such assumption and believes that the Court notified each by letter and the letter meant for Cummings had not yet been sent. Compare Paley, Part II, and Wright, 135.&lt;/ref&gt; he used his medical knowledge to commit suicide using drugs available there. His death provoked the only press coverage of the Court's work.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Parts I and II; Wright, 133-6&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kenneth Day''' was a popular student athlete and the roommate of Cyril Wilcox, whose suicide triggered the creation of the Court. He admitted to sexual relations with men and was expelled. Though told he might be considered for readmission, his repeated requests were denied. He married in April 1926 and moved to New York, where he worked as a head bank teller. He had two daughters, was widowed late in life, and married twice more.&lt;ref&gt;'Paley, Part I; Wright, 54-9, 163-73&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harry Dreyfus''' was born Henry Arthur Dreyfus on January 24, 1891. He was 8 years older than Cyril Wilcox, the Harvard student with whom he had an affair. He worked at the Café Dreyfus, which was known in certain circles as a gathering place for homosexuals, in the hotel his father owned in Boston. Though in no way connected to Harvard, he submitted to the Court's interrogation. The Court terminated its interview notes with the words "No action possible." He moved to Providence in the late 1920s, where he lived as a bachelor.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, 22-4, 100-101. His parents Maria and Arthur Dreyfus owned Boston's Dreyfus Hotel, which collapsed in 1925 killing 44 [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4th]] revelers in the Pickwick Club, which operated on the third floor.&lt;/ref&gt; He died in September 1978 in Miami.&lt;ref&gt;He obtained his social security number in Rhode Island as Harry Dreyfus. Social Security Death Index.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stanley Gilkey''', a sophomore from [[New Hampshire]] and the son of a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] minister, was probably an active homosexual, but he successfully lied to the Court about his associates and judgments. The Court expelled him for associating too closely with Roberts, for demonstrating an interest in the subject of homosexuality, and for claiming the ability to recognize homosexuals. He admitted reading works by [[Havelock Ellis]], but explained that his interest in homosexuality was just part of his more general interest in [[criminology]]. Though expelled, the Court had no evidence he had participated in homosexual activity. His request to be readmitted was granted in 1921 and he graduated in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;The Court wrote to Gilkey's father: "He has, by reading and conversation found out too much about homosexual matters. Secondly, he has been most indiscreet in saying in a public restaurant that a certain student looked to him like a man guilty of homosexual practices. In the third place, he has been too closely acquainted with the ringleader in these practices, and has visited his room too often." Wright, 205&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in [[Paris]] for two years, then returned to the U.S., where he produced ten Broadway shows over 20 years. He died in Pacifica, California in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Parts I and II;  Wright, 107-11, 207-9; quote 205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/05/archives/stanley-gilkey-79-producer-of-3-broadway-revues-in-40s.html "Stanley Gilkey, 79, Producer Of 3 Broadway Revues in 40's," November 5, 1979], accessed December 18, 2009; Internet Broadway Database: [http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=23860 Stanley Gilkey], accessed December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Windsor Hosmer'''&lt;ref&gt;He used variations of his full name: Windsor Arnold Hosmer, including W. Arnold Hosmer.&lt;/ref&gt; was born in upstate New York in 1894. After two years at Harvard, he interrupted his studies to serve in the Ambulance Corps with the French army in World War I and then returned to graduate in 1919. During the Court's investigations he was a graduate student in business and the proctor of Perkins Hall. He earned his Harvard MBA in 1921. He then taught briefly at Harvard Business School before moving to [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart College]]. He returned to Harvard in 1931 and became a full professor in 1937. He published several accounting texts and served as an adviser on accounting to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] in the 1950s. He set up and helped manage two small businesses and tried to establish a formal program in small business management at Harvard Business School. With two colleagues he published ''Small Business Management'' in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;W. Arnold Hosmer, Frank L. Tucker, and Arnold C. Cooper, ''Small Business Management: A Casebook'' R. D. Irwin, (January 1, 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from teaching in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Cruikshank, ''Shaping the Waves: A History of Entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School'' (Harvard Business Press (March 1, 2005), 144-9. Different sources locate his New York origins in Riga, New York, or nearby Berlin. Compare Cruikshank, 144, and ''Harvard Alumni Directory'' (Boston: Harvard Alumni Association, 1919), 348. Wright identifies the proctor by name. The ''Crimson'' article does not.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[J. Edward Lumbard|Joseph Lumbard]]''' was a 19-year-old student who, in the Court's judgment, was "too closely connected" with others who had committed homosexual acts, including his roommate, Edward Say, who was "deeply involved." Lumbard had come to terms with Say's odd behavior and showed him a measure of sympathy. For not segregating himself from his roommate's friends and for showing too much curiosity he was expelled. Not having committed a homosexual act, Lumbard gained readmission in 1921 and graduated from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1925. Harvard twice provided explanations for Lumbard's expulsion, once in 1931 when he was being considered for employment by the [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]]'s office and again in 1953 when President-elect [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was considering him for a seat on the [[United States Court of Appeals]]. In the second case, at least, Harvard's Registrar reported that he gave the FBI "the facts in the case clearing L[umbard] of any question," saying that Lumbard had been expelled "solely because of association with [the homosexual] group spacially." Lumbard married in 1929. Better known as [[J. Edward Lumbard]], he had a long and distinguished legal career in private practice and in government and died in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Parts I and II; Wright, 87-93, 127-31, 175-78, 181-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/07/nyregion/j-edward-lumbard-jr-97-judge-and-prosecutor-is-dead.html Nick Ravo, "J. Edward Lumbard Jr., 97, Judge and Prosecutor, Is Dead," June 7, 1999], accessed December 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernest Weeks Roberts''' made his rooms the center of the homosexual social scene. His letter to Cyril Wilcox, arriving after the latter's suicide, made his sexual position clear. He was the son of retired U.S. Representative [[Ernest W. Roberts|Ernest William Roberts]] and had served during [[World War I]] in the Harvard unit of the [[Students' Army Training Corps]] (SATC). Despite his poor academic performance, he hoped to enter [[Harvard Medical School]]. The Court expelled him. He married less than a year later, saw the birth of Ernest Jr. at the end of 1921, and enjoyed a successful career as an interior decorator.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Parts I and II; Wright, 113ff, 158-9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harold Winfield Saxton''' was a 25-year-old Harvard graduate working as a tutor to Harvard students. The Court had the incriminating letter he wrote to Cyril Wilcox and he contradicted himself when giving testimony. The Court banished him from the university and thereafter he had difficulty finding employment when Harvard refused to recommend him. After teaching at a variety of schools around the country, as well as in England, Saxton eventually returned home to [[Chelsea, Massachusetts]], where he remained at his parents' home until at least 1942. Nothing further is known of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Part II; Wright, 123-4, 210-2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edward Say''' was 20 years old and had a rather delicate constitution after spending years recovering from a spinal deformity. He insisted he had never engaged in any homosexual activity, though other witnesses before the Court claimed that he had. After the Court expelled him, he returned to [[Connecticut]] and worked as a securities salesman. He was active in his church and remained unmarried when he was killed in the crash of a car in which he was a passenger on July 13, 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Parts I and II; Wright, 87ff., 203-5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Keith Smerage''' was a junior and a member of the Dramatic Club. To the Court he confessed to a variety of homosexual contacts before realizing that the Court would not respond to honesty with leniency. In a confrontational conclusion, he told the Court he could add 50 additional names to the few he had already furnished, but would not. He later claimed the Court had tricked him into confessing by lying about the evidence against him. After being expelled, Smerage became assistant manager of his mother's inn in [[Topsfield, Massachusetts]]. He had some jobs in regional theater productions, using "Richard Keith" as his stage name, once playing the lead in ''Tangerine''.&lt;ref&gt;Internet Broadway Database: [http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=12599 ''Tangerine'']&lt;/ref&gt; He was out of work when he completed suicide by inhaling household gas in his [[Greenwich Village]] apartment on September 8, 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Parts I and II; Wright, 40, 101-6, 187ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1930/09/08/archives/exactor-found-dead-keith-smerage-a-victim-of-gas-in-grove-street.html "Ex-Actor Found Dead," September 8, 1930], accessed December 18, 2009. The ''Times'' reports that his roommate in New York said that at the time of his death Smerage had been unemployed for a year and a half and had previously worked as a busboy.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nathaniel Wollf''' was a 25-year-old from [[Buffalo, New York]], just days away from graduating, when he volunteered to Dean Greenough that he had information about the suicide of Cyril Wilcox and was quickly swept up in the Court's investigation. When interviewed he described several homosexual experiences but asserted he had made a clean break. The Court expelled him and refused his requests for re-admittance though it had initially offered hope that he might return. Wollf's application for admittance to [[McGill University]] was also denied because of Harvard's report of the reason for his expulsion. Wollf earned a medical degree at [[Bellevue Hospital Medical College]] in New York City. After studying psychiatry for three more years, he spent ten years pursuing painting and academic interests. He traveled widely and briefly converted to [[Islam]]. He opened a nightclub in [[Barcelona]] in 1935. During [[World War II]], he returned to the United States and he served as a psychiatrist for returning soldiers. He then practiced medicine in Mexico. He never married and died in London in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, Part I; Wright, 131-3, 215ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revelations and interpretations==
In 2002, a researcher from ''[[The Harvard Crimson|The Crimson]]'', the school's undergraduate daily newspaper, came across a box of files labeled "Secret Court" in the University Archives. After a protracted campaign on the part of the paper's staff, the university released five hundred documents relating to the Court's work. An article by Amit R. Paley in ''The Crimson''{{'}}s weekly magazine ''Fifteen Minutes'' reported the 1920 events on November 21, 2002. Though the University insisted on redacting the names of those under investigation, six researchers at the paper were able to identify most through research in other records.&lt;ref&gt;''Harvard Crimson'': [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2002/11/21/the-secret-court-of-1920-cont/ Amit R. Paley, "The Secret Court of 1920, Part III," November 21, 2002], accessed December 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard University's President [[Lawrence H. Summers]] responded to that story with these words:

{{quote|These reports of events long ago are extremely disturbing. They are part of a past that we have rightly left behind. I want to express our deep regret for the way this situation was handled, as well as the anguish the students and their families must have experienced eight decades ago. Whatever attitudes may have been prevalent then, persecuting individuals on the basis of sexual orientation is abhorrent and an affront to the values of our university. We are a better and more just community today because those attitudes have changed as much as they have.&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Post'': [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57942-2002Nov30.html "Harvard Secret Court Expelled Gay Students in 1920," December 1, 2002], accessed December 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An editorial in ''The Crimson'' two weeks later called on the university to grant "posthumous honorary degrees" to those expelled and not allowed to return. It also charged that by failing to reveal the names of the students involved "the University implies that they were accused of some legitimate transgression."&lt;ref&gt;''Harvard Crimson'': [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2002/12/6/an-82-year-old-mistake-in-late-may/ "An 82-Year-Old Mistake," December 6, 2002], accessed December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to the editor the next week, Gladden J. Pappin, a Harvard junior and editor of a conservative campus magazine, the ''Harvard Salient'', objected to the editorial's proposed degrees and called the Court's work "a very appropriate disciplinary move." He also called for the administration to "reestablish standards of morality" and punish violators, noting that "Such punishments would apply to heterosexuals, of course, but even more so to homosexuals, whose activities are not merely immoral but perverted and unnatural." In a similar vein, conservative commentator [[Pat Buchanan]] wrote: "Harvard appears to have quietly expelled a few deviates while avoiding a public scandal that would have ruined their reputations and damaged Harvard’s good name. What did Harvard do wrong?...Harvard has not only turned its back on its Christian past, it has just renounced its Christian roots as poisoned and perverted."&lt;ref&gt;''Harvard Crimson'': [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2002/12/9/secret-court-rightly-punished-immorality-to/ Gladden J.

A book-length study of the Court's work ''Harvard's Secret Court'' ([[St. Martin's Press]], 2005) was written by [[William Wright (author)|William Wright]]. More of a popular dramatization than a history, the book recounts the Court's work in considerable detail, but also includes imagined conversations and considerable speculation. Where only the notes of an interrogation survive, the author reconstructs the questions and even characterizes the tone of voice of the questioners.&lt;ref&gt;''Boston Globe'': [http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2005/11/27/a_shameful_episode_in_harvard_history/ Alan Helms, "A shameful episode in Harvard history," Book Review, November 27, 2005], accessed December 19, 2009. Helms mentions "unattributed quotations" and "ambiguous referents" and calls the book "riddled with contradictions." He summarizes his assessment with these words: "inherently fascinating, sloppy, largely well written, sometimes inaccurate, and wholly maddening." See also: ''Harvard Crimson'': [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/11/3/writing-the-wrong-the-bawdy-parties/ "Writing the Wrong," November 3, 2005], accessed February 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Michael Van Devere wrote, produced, and directed a different kind of dramatization: a film based on the Court's work called ''Perkins 28: Testimony From the Secret Court Files of 1920''. The film consists of re-enactments of 9 of the Court's interrogation sessions and uses a cast of Harvard undergraduates. The screenplay uses the Court's documents as its starting point.&lt;ref name="crimson2"&gt;''The Harvard Crimson'': [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2008/11/13/silenced-voices-finally-speak-out-in/ "Silenced Voices Finally Speak Out in 'Perkins 28'," November 13, 2008], accessed December 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a movement called "Their Day in the Yard," aiming to petition Harvard University to grant posthumous honorary degrees to the expelled students, launched a Facebook page and a website.&lt;ref&gt;Their Day in the Yard: [http://secretcourt.org/ "About"], accessed June 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On February 28, 2012, the University said in a statement that it "does not award posthumous degrees except in the rare case of a student who completes all academic requirements for the degree but dies before the degree has been conferred."&lt;ref&gt;''MetroWeekly'': "How Lady Gaga and Gay Students From the '20s Overlap: A Secret Court, a New Foundation - Metro Weekly." ''Metro Weekly''. N.p., 01 Mar. 2012. Web. 07 Oct. 2015. accessed March 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Harvard Crimson'' reported that at least 28 posthumous degrees were granted to former students who did not complete their academic requirements before dying in World War I.&lt;ref&gt;''The Harvard Crimson'': [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1922/3/3/posthumous-degrees-awarded-to-28-men/ "Posthumous Degrees Awarded to 28 Men," March 3, 1922], accessed May 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Two stage works dramatizing the Court and the affected students have been presented in New York. In 2010, ''VERITAS'', by Stan Richardson, was presented at the [[New York International Fringe Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/13/theater/13fringe.html Steven McElroy, "Fringe Festival: The Edge, the Center and the Kitchen Sink," August 12, 2010], accessed June 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2011 [[Classic Stage Company]] presented ''Unnatural Acts: Harvard's Secret Court of 1920'', conceived by Tony Speciale and created by members of the Plastic Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [http://theater.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/theater/reviews/unnatural-acts-a-harvard-episode-review.html Ben Brantley, "Behind the Closed Doors of Harvard, 91 Years Ago," June 23, 2011], accessed June 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Single Best Answer''' ('''SBA''' or '''One Best Answer''') is a written examination form of [[multiple choice]] questions used extensively in [[medical education]].

== Structure ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SBA example.jpg|thumbnail|SBA example from Medical Schools Council, UK]] --&gt;

A single question is posed with typically five alternate answers, from which the candidate must choose the best answer. This method avoids the problems of past examinations of a similar form described as Single Correct Answer. The older form can produce confusion where more than one of the possible answers has some validity. The newer form makes it explicit that more than one answer may have elements that are correct, but that one answer will be superior.

Prior to the widespread introduction of SBAs into medical education, the typical form of examination was true-false [[multiple choice]] questions. But during the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], educators found that SBAs would be superior.&lt;ref name="pmid18585017"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18585017 | doi=10.1016/j.clon.2008.05.010 | volume=20 | title=The introduction of single best answer questions as a test of knowledge in the final examination for the fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists in Clinical Oncology | year=2008 | journal=Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol) | pages=571–6 | last1 = Tan | first1 = LT | last2 = McAleer | first2 = JJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Student debt''' is a form of [[debt]] that is owed by an attending, formerly withdrawn, or graduated [[student]] to a lending institution, or to a [[financial institution]]. 

The lent amount, often referred to as a ''[[student loan]]'' or the debts may be owed to the school (or the bank) if the student has [[dropping out|dropped classes]] and withdrawn from the school. Withdrawing from a school, especially if a low (or no-[[income]] student) has withdrawn with a failing grade, could deprive the student of the ability of further attendance by disqualifying the student of necessary financial aid. Student loans also differ in many countries in the strict laws regulating renegotiating and [[bankruptcy]]. Due payments may be a retroactive penalty for services rendered by the school to the individual, including [[room and board]].

As with most other types of debt, student debt may be considered [[Default (finance)|defaulted]] after a given period of non-response to requests by the school or the lender for information, payment or negotiation. At that point, the debt is turned over to a [[Student Loan Guarantor]] or a [[collection agency]].

In the [[United States]], the “Congress created a rule called the ‘Cohort Default rate’. Annually the Department of Education evaluates the proportions of students who have received student loans and have withdrawn from a college, and have a defaulted on their federal government backed loans.”{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} If that nonpayment (default) rate is too high, the college will be refused the privilege of having government financial aid available to their students. Also you can not get federal financial aid if you dont have a passing grade or if you are not showing them you are committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fafsa.ed.gov/help/fftoc03a.htm|title=Am I eligible to receive financial aid?|website=fafsa.ed.gov|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Adam Looney, and Constantine Yannelis with the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, in 2011, “borrowers at for-profit and 2-year institutions represented almost half of student-loan borrowers leaving school and starting to repay loans, and accounted for 70 percent of student loan defaults." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A crisis in student loans?

Colleges have to change their funding habits to get in line with the government guidelines. Many colleges are continuously forced to lower their nonpayment rates, down.” The number of defaulters has not changed, it is just the way the government tracks them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Student Debt Is Worse Than You Think|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/08/upshot/student-debt-is-worse-than-you-think.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-10-07|access-date = 2015-12-11|issn = 0362-4331|first = Kevin|last = Carey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Many factors are accountable for student debt. The growing problem of student debt has become more prominent, inspiring numerous documentaries that examine the causes and effects. One factor is amount of interest on the loans. Another factor is the new guidelines developed by the federal government. There are now new rules deciding who can borrow, as well as how much debt they can take on.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/07/06/debt|title=Inside Higher Ed's News|website=www.insidehighered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colleges and universities have been increasing the costs for students to attend their schools subsequently increasing the amount of debt these students take on as student loans. Reports have shown that borrowers who finished college in the early 1990s were able to manage their student loans without an enormous burden.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; The average debt increased 58% since in the seven years from 2005 to 2012.

There are two types of loans students borrow in the US: Federal loans and Private loans. Federal loans have a fixed interest rate, usually lower than private loans' interest, set annually by the congress. The direct subsidized loan with the maximum amount of $5,500 has an interest rate of 4.45%, while the direct plus loan with the maximum amount of $20,500 has an interest rate of 7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/aid-glance-2018-19.pdf|title=Federal Student Aid at a Glance|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for private loans, there are more options like fixed interest rate, variable interest rate, and income based monthly plans whose interest rates vary depending on the lender, credit history and cosigners. The average interest rate for a private loan in 2017 was 9.66%.&lt;ref name="CNBC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/18/student-loan-interest-rates-edge-higher-and-higher.html|title=Student loan interest rates edge higher and higher|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Economist'' reported in June 2014 that U.S. student loan debt exceeded $1.2 trillion with [[Student loan default in the United States|over 7 million debtors in default]].

The interest rates are a major factor in the alarming debt numbers, however, the booming of prices of college is another major factor for US tremendous student debt. The Public universities increased their fees by a total of 27% over the five years ending in 2012, or 20% adjusted for inflation. Public university students paid an average of almost $8,400 annually for in-state tuition, with out-of-state students paying more than $19,000. For two decades ending in 2012, college costs rose 1.6% more than inflation each year. Government funding per student fell 27% between 2007 and 2012. Student enrollments rose from 15.2 million in 1999 to 20.4 million in 2011, but fell 2% in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21605906-cost-crisis-changing-labour-markets-and-new-technology-will-turn-old-institution-its|title=Creative destruction|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21605899-staid-higher-education-business-about-experience-welcome-earthquake-digital|title=The digital degree|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bloomberg'' reported in July 2014 that: "The biggest growth in the program came in the past decade, as student debt rose an average of 14 percent a year, to $966 billion in 2012 from $364 billion in 2004, according to New York Fed data."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/quicktake/student-debt/|title=Bloomberg-Student Debt-July 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Student loan borrowers that attended a for profit, and two year community colleges, in comparison, earn low annual salaries; an average of $22,000 for people withdrawing from schools as of 2010. This means that these people have troubles paying back their loans. The new evidence is reliable with the previous data. For example, the statistics presenting that default rates are essentially lower within the demographic of borrowers with large loans than within borrowers with small loans. However, the new evidence which goes back twenty years, shows how much the scenery of borrowing has changed. Currently, most borrowers are older and attended a for profit or two year community college. About ten years ago, the standard borrower was an established student at a four-year university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = New Data Gives Clearer Picture of Student Debt|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/upshot/new-data-gives-clearer-picture-of-student-debt.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-09-10|access-date = 2015-12-11|issn = 0362-4331|first = Susan|last = Dynarski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, tuition has been rising due to the cuts of government funding in education. As an example, more specifically, the University of Pittsburgh has had an increase in tuition of 3.9 percent for the academic school year of 2014-15. In 2014, the U.S. Department of Education ranked Pitt as the most expensive public university for tuition and fees at $16,240, just ahead of Penn State University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2014/07/18/University-of-Pittsburgh-spproves-3-9-percent-tuition-increase/stories/201407180160|title=University of Pittsburgh approves 3.9 percent tuition increase|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the difference in median annual income between those with a bachelor's degree vs. those with a high school diploma was $16,638, though this varies considerably by field of study.&lt;ref&gt;Source: US Census Bureau. See charts at [[Income in the United States]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===

Canada ranks second in the world behind Korea for the percentage of people in the age group of 25-34 with a bachelor's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.oecd.org/eduatt/population-with-tertiary-education.htm|title=Education attainment - Population with tertiary education - OECD Data|website=theOECD|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Canadians are not prone to the rapid accumulation of student loans. As of September 2012, the average debt for a Canadian leaving University was 28,000 Canadian dollars, and that accumulated debt takes an average of 14 years to fully repay based on an average starting salary of $39,523.&lt;ref name="Student debt: Average payback takes fourteen years"&gt;{{cite web|title=Student debt: Average payback takes 14 years |url=http://business.financialpost.com/2012/09/04/student-debt-average-payback-takes-14-years/ |publisher=Financial Post |accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To temporarily help their low income struggling citizens with student debt, Canada has a program called "interest relief". It grants 6 months free of mandatory payments, for a maximum of 30 months. The Canadian government pays for the interest on those loans during the grace period, so the loan amount is the same at the end of the grace period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/learning/canada_student_loan/interest_relief.shtml|title=Interest Relief for Canada Student Loans|date=2007-06-17|access-date=2018-05-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617075259/http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/learning/canada_student_loan/interest_relief.shtml|archivedate=2007-06-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, students are relieved of their debt after 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/education/repayment-assistance-plan.html|title=Repayment Assistance Plan - Canada.ca|last=Canada|first=Employment and Social Development|website=www.canada.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a nation, Canadians have accumulated more than $15 billion of student loan debt as they continue to fight tuition rates from further skyrocketing.&lt;ref name="Canadian Federation of Students"&gt;{{cite web| title=Canadian Federation of Students |url=http://www.cfs-fcee.ca|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
There is concern about the level of student debt in the United Kingdom. There is also concern about possible changes in government policy forcing graduates to pay back more.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-38651059 Could tuition fees really cost £54,000?] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Adonis]] claims most [[student loan]]s will never be repaid, Adonis also states that university leaders have failed to improve teaching standards but rewarded themselves handsomely with high salaries. The [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]] claims that 75% of graduates will never repay all their debts. Andrew McGettigan, loans system expert said, “Until the government removes their right to retrospectively change terms, then you as a borrower appear to be on the hook to future policy changes".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jul/07/tuition-fees-should-be-scrapped-says-architect-of-fees-andrew-adonis Tuition fees should be scrapped, says 'architect' of fees Andrew Adonis] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Sebastian Burnside NatWest economist, said “These latest figures show student debt is becoming of greater priority with every passing year. Student debt is the fastest growing type of borrowing and is rapidly becoming economically significant.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jun/15/uk-student-loan-debt-soars-to-more-than-100bn UK student loan debt soars to more than £100bn] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
With student debt being one of the most prominent issues in the world, it seems Germany has found a solution to avoid tremendous student debt that many first world countries face. Germany has both private and public universities with the majority being public universities. For undergraduate studies, public universities are free but have an enrollment fee of no more than €250 per year which is roughly 305 USD. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/student-info/student-finance/how-much-does-it-cost-study-germany|title=How Much Does it Cost to Study in Germany|last=Playdon|first=Jane|date=2018-04-24|website=Top Universities|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Their private universities cost an average of €10,000 a semester which is about 12,000 USD.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Private universities account for 7.1% enrollment with the rest attending the public universities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The private universities have a smaller teacher to student ratio and tend to offer more specialized programs which is why Germany is experiencing a boom in private universities enrollment in recent years for majors like law and medicine. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wenr.wes.org/2016/11/education-in-germany|title=Education in Germany|last=Trines|first=Stefan|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;However, most students still prefer public universities due to the drastic difference in tuition cost. The only expense students take out loans for in public universities is the living cost which ranges from €3600 to €8,200 a year depending on the university location.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, the repayment of this loan is interest free and no borrower pays more than €10,000 regardless of the borrowed amount. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.study-in.de/en/plan-your-stay/money-and-costs/cost-of-living_28220.php|title=Around 850 a Month for Living Expenses|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The average debt at graduation is €5,600 which is 6,680 USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global Debt Patterns|last=Usher|first=Alex|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chance to gain a bachelor's through well respected universities at a reasonable price without interest packed loans attracts many foreign students as seen through increased enrollment of students from all around the world.

=== France ===
France offers a reasonable price for college. The average tuition for a bachelor’s degree is around 190 euros a year, around 620 euros a year for engineering degrees, around 260 euros a year for a master's degree and around 400 euros a year for a PhD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.campusfrance.org/en/tuition-fees-France|title=Low university tuition fees in France|last=|first=|date=|website=www.campusfrance.org|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; These prices are similar to its neighboring country, Germany. The cost of living in France is an average of 500 to 1250 euros a month depending on the city which is not included in the tuition price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.studying-in-france.org/costs-of-attending-college-in-france/|title=Costs of Attending College in France - Study in France|date=2013-07-24|work=Study in France|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are able to take out loans in order to pay for these expenses. Only less than 2% students take out loans as there is financial assistance to pay for the full tuition or half of the tuition for low income families depending on their needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.linternaute.fr/argent/guide-de-vos-finances/1407390-les-bourses-de-l-enseignement-superieur/|title=Les bourses de l'enseignement supérieur|access-date=2018-05-11|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pakistan ===
Student loans are an unknown concept in Pakistan, like most third world countries. Students attend college through the help of their parents who spend majority of their income on their children’s education and some students work to help out with the tuition. The top universities in Pakistan are mostly located in the provinces of Sindh and Punjab. There are 177 universities in the country. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1111394/analysis-rising-cost-higher-education-pakistan/|title=Analysis: The rising cost of higher education in Pakistan - The Express Tribune|date=2016-05-27|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;To better understand this number, let’s consider the US which is twelve times the size of Pakistan and has 5900 colleges. That means the US has about 477 universities in an area as big as Pakistan.

Pakistan has universities ranking in the top 250 and top 700 in the world.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/where-to-study/asia/pakistan/guide#tab=1|title=Study in Pakistan|date=2016-04-05|work=Top Universities|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average tuition cost for these universities is around 402,000 Pakistani Rupees ($3500). But this is not the only expense citizens have to pay for; most people pay for books, food, bus or van to get to their university and a tuition center for help with the tough curriculum which adds up to about 130,000 Rupees ($1147).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Even though this seems like a small total to someone from the first world, this is very expensive for Pakistanis as the average salary is about $7,800 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/pakistan/annual-household-income-per-capita|title=Pakistan Annual Household Income per Capita {{!}} Economic Indicators|website=www.ceicdata.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of parents cannot afford college education for their children which is why only 12% of all 18-24 years olds are attending college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/comment/safety-numbers-higher-education-pakistan#survey-answer|title=Safety in numbers: higher education in Pakistan|date=2016-04-21|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland ===
Excluding students from outside Switzerland, the EU, or EEA, there is no tuition fee for students studying at Finnish Universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.study.eu/article/tuition-fees-in-finland-8-things-you-need-to-know|title=Tuition fees in Finland: 8 things you need to know|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, many exemptions for non-Finnish citizens studying at a Finnish University to not pay tuition as well. In addition to going to college for free, students also receive student grants from the government. These grants are generally used for housing and compensates for up to 80% of rent for students who live independently and/or not qualified to receive child benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eenee.de/eeneeHome/EENEE/Analytical-Reports.html|title=Economics of Education in Europe - Analytical Reports|website=www.eenee.de|language=en|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through [[Kela (Finnish institution)|Kela]], 40% of students take out student loans in addition to student grants. Student loans average to about 650 EUR a month for higher education within Finland and an average amount of 800 EUR a month for Finnish students studying abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.european-funding-guide.eu/articles/grants-and-loans/grants-and-loans-finland|title=Grants and Loans in Finland {{!}} EFG - European Funding Guide|website=www.european-funding-guide.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These loans are not through Kela itself but is a guaranteed loan through the student’s bank of choice. Besides just student loans and grants, Finland also compensates its citizens, and others that qualify, a meal subsidy, school transport subsidy, and a student loan compensation for students who finish schooling in a target time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://minedu.fi/en/student-financial-aid-system|title=Student financial aid reform 2017 in Finland|website=Opetus- ja kulttuuriministeriö|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kela.fi/web/en/student-loan-compensation|title=Student loan compensation|website=kela.en|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

In August 2017, Finland saw student loan drawdowns double to 143 million EUR from August 2016 as a result of being able to borrow 650 EUR a month from the previous 400 EUR a month. The reform for financial aid resulted in students that qualify for government-guaranteed loans to increase to over 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.suomenpankki.fi/en/Statistics/mfi-balance-sheet/older-news/2017/opintolainoja-nostettiin-ennatysmaara/|title=Student-loan drawdowns record high in August|last=Pankki|first=Suomen|website=Suomen Pankki|language=en|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Social and political reactions==
The growing problem of student debt has caused many reactions from young people throughout the United States. As a result, the Occupy Colleges and Occupy Student Debt movements merged in 2012 in an effort to gain support from students around the country.&lt;ref name="Abrams"&gt;{{cite web|last=Abrams|first=Natalia|title=Occupy Colleges and Occupy Student Debt Join Forces|url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/168795/occupy-colleges-and-occupy-student-debt-join-forces#|accessdate=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been significant efforts made via social media for the Occupy Student Debt campaign. In particular, students all over the United States have posted their personal student debt testimonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupy Student Debt|url=http://occupystudentdebt.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some success stories of students eliminating debt have been reported on,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/how-ebony-horton-paid-off-220000-worth-of-student-loans-in-3-years-2017-3 |title=How one 31-year-old paid off $220,000 in student loans in 3 years |last=Martin |first=Emmie |date=8 March 2017 |website=Business Insider |access-date=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are met with heavy skepticism. Since last October, Occupy Student Debt has provided a platform for over 800 students to share their horror stories.&lt;ref name="Abrams"/&gt; Because of this, other organizations such as, Rebuild the Dream, Education Trust, and the Young Invincibles, have joined in the effort and started similar platforms.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist [[David Graeber]], author of ''[[Debt: The First 5000 Years]],'' argues that student debt is "destroying the imagination of youth":

{{quote|If there’s a way of a society committing mass suicide, what better way than to take all the youngest, most energetic, creative, joyous people in your society and saddle them with, like $50,000 of debt so they have to be slaves? There goes your music. There goes your culture. There goes everything new that would pop out. And in a way, this is what’s happened to our society. We’re a society that has lost any ability to incorporate the interesting, creative and eccentric people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truthdig.com/avbooth/item/david_graeber_there_has_been_a_war_on_the_human_imagination_20130812 David Graeber: ‘There Has Been a War on the Human Imagination’].

In 2014, a Chilean activist, artist Francisco Tapia, known as "Papas Fritas" (French Fries) "burned $500 million worth of debt papers" from [[Viña del Mar University]], and displayed the ashes in a van as an art project. "The University was being shut down due to financial irregularities. 'It is a concrete fact that the papers were burned. They are gone, burned completely, and there’s no debt,' said Papas Fritas in his first U.S. broadcast interview. 'Since these papers don’t exist anymore, there’s no way to charge the students.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

On November 12, 2015, students organized rallies at more than 100 college campuses across the United States to protest crippling student loan debt and to advocate for tuition-free higher education at public colleges and universities. The demonstrations took place just days after fast food workers [[Fast food worker strikes|went on strike]] for a minimum wage of $15 an hour and [[Labor rights|union rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/11/12/students-across-us-to-march-over-debt.html Students across US march over debt, free public college].

In 2015, [[Central Saint Martins]] student Brooke Purvis announced that he would burn his student loan as a form of protest art, raising awareness about student debt.

A February 2018 research paper from the [[Levy Economics Institute]] of [[Bard College]] argues that government cancellation student debt in the United States would result in rising consumer demand, along with economic growth and increased employment. Over the following decade, the GDP would increase by between $86 billion and $108 billion annually, which would result in an increase of between 1.2 and 1.5 million jobs and a decreased unemployment rate of 0.22 to 0.36 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Levitz|first=Eric|date=February 9, 2018 |title=We Must Cancel Everyone’s Student Debt, for the Economy’s Sake|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/02/lets-cancel-everyones-student-debt-for-the-economys-sake.html|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|location= |access-date=February 10, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Test of Practical Competency in ICT''' (TOPCIT) is a performance-evaluation-centered test designed to diagnose and assess the competency of Information Technology specialists and Software Developers that is critically needed to perform jobs on the professional frontier.

TOPCIT was developed and is administered by [[Korea]]'s [[Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning]] (MSIP) and the [[Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion]]. They are government agencies that overlook and manage [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] related [[R&amp;D]], policy, and [[Human Resources Management|HR development]].

== Background ==
Companies and [[higher education]] institutions voiced the need for a standardized and objective competency index that can reinforce the on-site competency of ICT/SW college students and narrow the gap between the viewpoints of industrial and academic circles regarding the qualifications of a competent specialist in the field.&lt;ref name="Daum News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.daum.net/politics/administration/newsview?newsid=20141030102810029|title=ICT 역량평가 'TOPCIT'에 4천여명 응시|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objective===
To improve the quality of ICT/SW education at universities, resolve the manpower shortage experienced by ICT companies, and expand the growth potential of ICT/SW industries and education system:

TOPCIT has been developed to objectively assess the competency of those planning on entering the ICT field. The analyzed data will assist universities and industries in admitting students or hiring new recruits respectively.
TOPCIT measures the competency by evaluating the test-takers’ answers to a series of creative problem solving questions and by assessing their executive ability.

===Participating Companies and Universities===
A total of 269 people from 231 companies and educational academies participated and founded the TOPCIT (August 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topcit.or.kr/?mCode=K01030000&amp;lCode=KR|title=About TOPCIT|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through mutual development of companies and academies, TOPCIT was made with an objective of closing the gap between the industry and academic circles regarding the practical qualifications of a competent specialist in this field. Through the systematic network between companies and schools, the gap between the demand of skilled workers that companies want and the skilled workers that the educational academies graduate will also be closed.

==Contents==
TOPCIT has a total of 65 questions with up to 1,000 points. There are 4 types of questions in the test: [[Multiple choice|multiple-choice]], short-answer, [[Descriptive Writing|descriptive-writing]], and [[Critical thinking|critical-thinking]] questions. There is a technical field and business field in the TOPCIT.&lt;ref name="Daum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.daum.net/digital/internet/newsview?newsid=20140921100104162|title=ICT 분야 토익 'TOPCIT', 11월 제2회 정기평가 시행|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical Field===

[[Image:TheDancingMaster-1stEd-TitlePage.png|thumb|350px|Title page of the 1st edition of The Dancing Master (1651)]]
'''''The Dancing Master''''' (first edition: '''''The English Dancing Master''''') is a dancing manual containing the music and instructions for [[English Country Dance]]s. It was published in several editions by [[John Playford]] and his successors from 1651 until c1728.  The first edition contained 105 dances with single line melodies; subsequent editions introduced new songs and dances, while dropping others, and the work eventually encompassed three volumes.  Dances from ''The Dancing Master'' were re-published in arrangements by [[Cecil Sharp]] in the early 20th century, and in these reconstructed forms remain popular among dancers today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22544">'''Undergraduate education''' is the [[post-secondary education]] previous to the [[postgraduate education]]. It includes all the academic programs up to the level of a [[bachelor's degree]]. For example, in the [[United States]], an entry level university student is known as an undergraduate, while students of higher degrees are known as [[Graduate student|graduates]]. In some other educational systems and subjects, undergraduate education is [[Higher education|post-secondary education]] up to the level of a [[master's degree]]; this is the case for some science courses in Britain and some medicine courses in Europe.

==Programs==
===Africa===
====Nigerian system====
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2008}}
In [[Nigeria]], undergraduate degrees (excluding Medicine, Medical Laboratory Science, Nursing, Engineering, Law and Architecture) are four-year-based courses. Medicine (MBBS) and Architecture normally take six years to complete studies while Medical Laboratory Science, Nursing, Law and Engineering courses take five years to complete studies, usually, all six years are taken to improve their chances.

====South African system====
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2008}}
The South African system usually has a three-year undergraduate bachelor's degree, with two or three majors. (There are exceptions, such as the medical qualification (MBChB), which is six years.) A fourth year, known as an Honours year, is considered a post-graduate degree. It is usually course-driven, although may include a project or thesis.

===Americas===
====Brazilian system====
{{See also|Universities and Higher Education in Brazil}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2008}}
[[Brazil]] follows the major traits of the continental European system; free public schools are available from kindergarten up to postgraduation, both as a right established in Article 6, ''caput'' of the [[Brazilian Constitution]] and as a duty of the State in Article 208, Items I, IV and V, of the Brazilian Constitution.&lt;ref name="Planalto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/constituicao/constituicao.htm |title=Constituiусo |website=Planalto.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students choose their specific course of studies before joining the university. Admission to university is obtained by means of a competitive entrance exam known as [[Vestibular]] (a concept somewhat similar to the ''[[Baccalauréat]]'' in France). There's a new system, adopted by most federal universities, that uses the high school national examination ([[ENEM]]) result as part or a replacement of the Vestibular grade.&lt;ref name="MEC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.mec.gov.br/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=13318&amp;Itemid=310 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115081453/http://portal.mec.gov.br/index.php?Itemid=310&amp;id=13318&amp;option=com_content&amp;view=article |archivedate=2012-11-15 |df= }}
 &lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the chosen course, upon graduating the student shall be granted: a technologist diploma, 3 years to complete, a [[bachelor's degree]]'s [[diplom]]a, which usually takes 4 or, in the case of [[Law]], [[Veterinary]], [[Geology]] and [[Engineering]], 5 years to complete; or a professional [[diplom]]a, which normally require 5 or, in the case of [[medicine]], 6 years to complete.

====United States system====
In the [[United States|United States of America]] ''undergraduate'' refers to those who are studying for a bachelor's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yalecollege.yale.edu/ |title=Welcome &amp;#124; Yale College |website=Yalecollege.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common method consists of four years of study leading to a Bachelor of Arts ([[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]]), a Bachelor of Science ([[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]]), or sometimes another bachelor's degree such as Bachelor of Fine Arts ([[Bachelor of Fine Arts|B.F.A.]]), Bachelor of Music ([[Bachelor of Music|B. Mus.]]), Bachelor of Social Work ([[Bachelor of Social Work|B.S.W.]]), Bachelor of Engineering ([[Bachelor of Engineering|B.Eng.]]), Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs ([[B.S.P.A]]), Bachelor of Science in Nursing ([[Bachelor of Science in Nursing|B.S.N.]]), or Bachelor of Philosophy ([[B.Phil.]]) Five-Year Professional Architecture programs offer the Bachelor of Architecture Degree ([[B.Arch.]]) or sometimes Master of Architecture degree ([[M.Arch.]]).

Unlike in the British model, degrees in law and medicine are not offered at the undergraduate level and are completed as professional study after earning a bachelor's degree. Neither field specifies or prefers any undergraduate major, though medical schools have set prerequisite courses that must be taken before enrollment.

Some students choose to attend a [[community college]] for two years prior to further study at another college or university. In most states, community colleges are operated either by a division of the state university or by local special districts subject to guidance from a state agency. Community colleges award [[associate degree]]s of different types, some intended to prepare students to transfer to four-year schools (e.g. Associate of Arts (AA), Associate of Science (AS)), and others intended to provide vocational skills and training for students wishing to enter into or advance in a profession. Those seeking to continue their education may transfer to a four-year college or university after applying through a similar admissions process as those applying directly to the four-year institution called [[Articulation (education)|articulation]]. Some community colleges have automatic enrollment agreements with a local four-year college, where the community college provides the first two years of study and the university provides the remaining years of study, sometimes all on one campus. The community colleges award associate degrees, while universities and colleges award the bachelor's. However, some community colleges, such as [[Brazosport College]] in [[Lake Jackson, Texas]] offer bachelor's degrees along with associate degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brazosport College – Bachelor of Applied Technology (BAT) program|url=http://www.brazosport.edu/programs/BAT/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Brazosport College|accessdate=14 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029190844/http://www.brazosport.edu/programs/BAT/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=29 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, some universities such as the [[University of Delaware]] also award associate degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aap.udel.edu/ |title=University of Delaware Associate in Arts Program |publisher=[[University of Delaware]] |date=2017 |accessdate=November 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
====Hong Kong system====
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
In [[Hong Kong]], the English system is followed. Students sit for the [[HKCEE|Certificate of Education examinations]] at around sixteen years of age, and the [[HKALE|Advanced-level, or A-level examinations]] at around eighteen, then follow by three years of undergraduate education, except for a few specific fields, such as medicine, nursing and law. This is due to be changed, with five-year secondary education and two-year [[matriculation examination]] combined and shortened to six years [[matriculation]], and undergraduate education lengthened to four years. Students may be able to receive [[Curriculum#Higher education|general education]] in their first years in universities, more akin to the North American system. The first batch of students under the new system will enter universities in 2012.

====Indian system====
In [[India]] the Graduation system is classified into two parts: Undergraduation (UG) and Postgraduation (PG). It takes three or four years to complete an "undergraduate" degree. The three-year undergraduate programs are mostly in the fields of arts, commerce, science etc., and the four-year programs are mostly in the fields of technology, engineering, pharmaceutical sciences, agriculture etc. However, for medicine, law and architecture, the period has been five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csecduac.in/viewtopic.php?t=1325 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721161211/http://csecduac.in/viewtopic.php?t=1325 |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The possessor of the first UG is referred to as graduate and that of the PG degree as post-graduate.&lt;ref name="Anand2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. J.S.

====Pakistani system====
{{Main|Education in Pakistan}}
{{one source|section|date=April 2012}}
In [[Pakistan]], it generally requires four years to complete a [[Bachelor's degree]] in Arts, Sciences, Dentistry, Engineering or Business Administration such as [[BA degree|BA]], [[BS degree|BS]], [[Dental Degree|BDS]], [[B.E.|BE/BS/BSc Engineering]] or [[BBA]] and five years for bachelor's degrees in Medicine ([[MBBS]]), Physiotherapy ([[Doctor of Physical Therapy|DPT]]), Pharmacy ([[Pharm.D]]) and Architecture ([[B.Arch]]) after successfully completing 12 years of schooling. 4 years bachelor's degree is offered in various universities of Pakistan such as [[COMSATS Institute of Information Technology]] (CIIT), [[University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore]] (UET Lahore), [[University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila]] (UET Taxila), [[National University of Sciences and Technology (Pakistan)|National University of Sciences and Technology]] (NUST), [[Lahore University of Management Sciences]] (LUMS) and [[National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences]] (NU).

The modern educational system comprises the following five stages: The [[Primary school]] lasting five years for children 5–10 years old in grades one to five; a [[Middle school]] of three years for children 10 to 13 years old, covering grades six through eight; a two-year secondary, or [[Matriculation]] consists of grades nine and ten, for children 13 to 15 years old; a two-year higher secondary, or [[Intermediate college]], leading to an [[Faculty in Arts (Certificate)|F.A.]] in arts or [[Faculty in Science (Certificate)|F.Sc.]] in science; and a fifth stage covering college and university programs leading to baccalaureate, professional, master's and doctorate degrees. The pre-primary or preparatory classes, called kachi (literally, unripe) or [[Nursery school]], were formally integrated into the education system in 1988.

===Europe===
====English, Welsh, and Northern Irish system====
{{main|British undergraduate degree classification}}
Students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland may usually enter university from the age of eighteen, often having studied [[A-levels]] and thus having had thirteen to fifteen years of schooling. Occasionally students who finish A Level or equivalent qualifications early (after skipping a year in school on the grounds of academic giftedness) may enter below this age but large universities are now setting minimum age limits of 16 or 17 after a number of well publicised "child prodigies" were found to be emotionally and mentally unprepared for university life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Applications for undergraduate courses in UK higher education are made through the [[Universities and Colleges Admissions Service]] (UCAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucas.com/about_us/whoweare |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916053529/http://www.ucas.com/about_us/whoweare |archivedate=2008-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For their first degree, most students read for the degree of [[bachelor's degree|bachelor]], which usually takes three years, however in the sciences and engineering integrated courses covering both undergraduate level and advanced degree level leading to the degree of [[Master's degree in Europe#With Dissertation|master]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/academicinfrastructure/FHEQ/EWNI08/default.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915114853/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/academicinfrastructure/FHEQ/EWNI08/default.asp |archivedate=2008-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; usually taking four years and including a research project or [[dissertation]] are popular. Given the integrated nature of these programs someone who gains a master's degree via an integrated program is not usually admitted to the degree of bachelor.

Master's degrees conferred after extended programs are not to be conflated with the degree of [[Oxbridge MA|Master of Arts conferred at Oxbridge and Dublin]], which is not a substantive qualification, but reflects the ancient practice of those three universities of promoting Bachelors of Arts to Masters of Arts (and thus full membership of the University) six or seven years after matriculation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Honours degrees and integrated master's degrees are awarded with [[British undergraduate degree classification|1st, upper 2nd, lower 2nd or 3rd class honours]]. If a student passes the course but fails to do so sufficiently well for third class honours to be awarded he will be awarded with an ordinary degree. It is possible to use the abbreviation "Hons" after the degree [[post nominal letters|postnominals]] to indicate that the degree has been passed with honours and is not an ordinary degree.

Many universities offer [[sandwich course]]s or an extramural year, which offer work placements for a short period of time in a relevant industry before students complete their studies. Taking a sandwich course may make the course last a year longer than it would otherwise.

With [[Universities in the United_Kingdom#Funding|very few exceptions]], nearly all universities with the power to award degrees are heavily state financed. However, they also rely on tuition fees set by the government at a maximum index-linked level, repayable after graduation contingent on attaining a certain level of income, and with the state paying all fees for students from the poorest backgrounds. UK students are generally entitled to student loans for maintenance with repayment contingent on income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentfinancedirect.co.uk/portal/page?_pageid=53,1262207&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL |title=Student finance – GOV.UK |website=Studentfinancedirect.co.uk |date=2012-09-01 |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in other European countries, the British government does not own the universities' assets and university staff are not civil servants. United Kingdom universities are therefore better described as autonomous, intellectually-independent institutions with public funding, rather than public universities per se. The crown does not control syllabi, with the exception of teacher training. The crown restricts the power to award degrees to those with a [[royal charter]], in the case of traditional universities, or authorization from the [[DIUS|Secretary of State for Universities]], in the case of [[post-1992 universities|modern universities]]. Universities accredited in foreign countries, such as [[Richmond University]] are, however, free to operate.

====European Bologna process systems====
In many countries, the English distinction between a [[Bachelor's Degree|bachelor's]] and [[Master's Degree|master's]] degree is being introduced by the [[Bologna process]]. Under the new Bologna reform, universities in Europe are introducing the Bachelor level (BA or BS) degree, often by dividing a 5-year Master-level program into two parts (3-year Bachelor's + 2-year Master's), where students are not obligated to continue with the second Master's-degree part. These new bachelor's degrees are similar in structure to British bachelor's degrees.

If there is a separate undergraduate degree, higher degrees (License, Master, Doctorat) can be gained after completing the undergraduate degree. In the traditional German system, there were no undergraduate degrees in some fields, such as engineering: students continued to Master's level education without any administrative breakpoints, and employers would not consider half-finished master's degrees.

The Bachelor's phase in The Netherlands can be fulfilled either at university or at the [[Hogeschool#Netherlands|University of Applied Sciences]]. Except for some specific exceptions, only at universities students are able to graduate for their masters or be promoted. These two institutions differ from each other in the level students learn abstract concepts. Whereas theories are created at the university, at the University of Applied Sciences theories are taught to be applied correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo-raad.nl/english |title=Vereniging Hogescholen &amp;#124; English |website=Hbo-raad.nl |date= |accessdate=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scottish system====
Students in Scotland usually enter university in the year they turn eighteen (with many still being seventeen upon starting), hence courses take an extra year compared to England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

At the older universities the degree of [[Scottish MA|Master of Arts]] is conferred in the arts subjects after four years while the newer universities instead confer the degree of [[Bachelor of Arts]]. The degree of [[Scottish MA|Master of Arts conferred by the Ancient Scottish Universities]] is equivalent to the degree of Bachelor of Arts at other universities and does not require the level of study necessitated for the other degrees of master awarded by these universities. The degree instead reflects the ancient traditions of these universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/academicinfrastructure/FHEQ/background/ewni/positionPaperAnnex.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130012420/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/academicinfrastructure/FHEQ/background/ewni/positionPaperAnnex.asp |archivedate=2008-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sciences, students usually read for the [[bachelor's degree|degree of bachelor]], which usually takes four years. However, as with the rest of the UK, integrated master's degrees are popular in science and engineering, although in Scotland they last for five years. Degree classification is same as that of the rest of UK

====Other European systems====
In many other, particularly continental European systems, an "undergraduate" degree in the American sense does not exist. Because students are expected to have received a sound general education at the secondary level, in a school such as a [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] or [[lycee]], students in Europe enroll in a specific course of studies they wish to pursue upon entry into a University. In the US, students only specialize in a "major" during the last years of college. Specializing in a field of study upon entry into a university means most students graduate after four to five years of study. The fields available include those only taught as graduate degrees in the US, such as [[law]] or [[medicine]].

In the traditional German system, there is a vocational degree ([[Diploma]] [[Fachhochschule|FH]]) that is similar in length, and is also considered an academic degree. Though it is designed as a specialist degree, in contrast to the Diplom degree at ''University'', which claims to be more generalist. Germany itself, however, is currently abolishing the legal distinction between [[Fachhochschule]] and University. They are both translated as university and they both provide bologna-compliant and equivalent postgraduate degrees.&lt;ref&gt;''Ländergemeinsame Strukturvorgaben – Beschluss der Kultusministerkonferenz vom 10.10.2003 i.d.F. vom 15.06.2007''&lt;/ref&gt;

Not obligatory and sometimes applied at Universities in the Netherlands are the [[Propaedeutics|propaedeutic]] exams. The entire curriculum of the first two semesters of the bachelor's programme is part of the propaedeutic exams. In most bachelor's studies, students are required to obtain their propaedeutic certificate within three semesters after starting the course. A propaedeutic certificate also counts as a requirement for participating in a university level bachelor's study. The propaedeutic exams have the purpose of assessing whether a student has the appropriate capacities in order to complete the course.

At some Swedish universities (such as the [[Royal Institute of Technology]]), PhD courses are sometimes referred to as "graduate courses", whereas courses for other students (up to master level) sometimes are referred to as "undergraduate courses". The system at many Finnish universities is similar.

In the [[French Education System|French system]], the first degree of tertiary education was reached two years after the [[baccalauréat]]. Amongst these degrees the university-delivered [[DEUG]] has disappeared, whereas [[Diplôme universitaire de technologie]], [[Brevet de Technicien Supérieur]] or [[classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles]] still exist. According to the [[Bologna process]], this two-year curriculum will be replaced by the three-year [[licence]], yet existing.

'''Virtual Researcher on Call''' ('''VROC''') is a [[Canada|Canadian]] educational program administered by [[Partners in Research]].  The program connects students with knowledge partners — researchers and professionals — in [[health science|health]] and [[natural sciences]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], and [[mathematics]] ([[STEM fields]]) through [[video conferencing]] and [[podcast|video podcasts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vroc.ca/video/ VROC Video Podcasts]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video conferencing==
Video conferencing technology is used to connect researchers and professionals in the STEM fields with [[elementary school|elementary]] and [[secondary school]] classrooms for real time, interactive discussion.

==Partners==
VROC is partnered with over 40 universities, colleges and institutions as well as school boards across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.vroc.ca/vroc/en/partner/| title=Partnered Institutions| publisher=VROC| date=30 August 2010| accessdate=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
VROC began with a "Reaching Higher" [[government grant|grant]] from the Ontario [[Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities]] in 2006 under the [[Dalton McGuinty]] government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://ogov.newswire.ca/ontario/GPOE/2006/04/03/c1712.html?lmatch=&amp;lang=_e.html| title=McGuinty Government Investing in Science Students| author=CNW Group| date=3 April 2006| accessdate=4 September 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Partners in Research was awarded a nearly million dollar grant from the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario to teach southern Ontarian students about careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feddevontario.gc.ca/eic/site/723.nsf/eng/00682.html Government of Canada Supports Science and Tech Programming for Southern Ontario Youth]&lt;/ref&gt;

Partners in Research hosts a national annual awards reception and ceremony entitled The PIR National Awards to celebrate Canadian research in the STEM fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pirweb.org/pir/en/pir-event/| title=PIR National Awards| publisher=Partners in Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeds from this evening support the Virtual Researcher On Call Program.

A '''whipping boy''' or girl are children who are in slavery and suffer corporal punishment on behalf of their young master when the latter did something wrong.  As both grew up and spend quite a lot of time together, a friendship or affectionate tie often developed between the young slave child and the young master.  The slave boy or girl had to undergo the physical punishment and the young master had to watch, thus undergoing an emotional punishment instead of a physical which was / is often seen as too cruel to inflict on one's own children or children of one's own [[caste]].

The winner of the [[Prix des droits de l'homme des Nations unies]] 2013 [[Biram Dah Abeid]] - who was raised himself as a child slave in [[Mauritania]] - testifies of this practise of child [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souffre-douleur enfant souffre-douleur] in [[Mauritania]].  In the slavery caste it is customary that when boys reach the age of circumcision, they can choose a slave boy who will grow up with his young master. Because they spend a lot of time together, it happens that a certain bond of friendship or appreciation settles between the young master and his slave. To punish the young master, there is a custom of subjecting punishments e.g. floggings to the young slave instead of this master who is obliged to watch his friend undergoing the flogging, thus inflicting the master this way emotional suffering, but not the physical suffering which is too cruel according to local custom to be born by their own children.


A '''whipping boy''' or girl was, supposedly, a child educated alongside a [[prince]]/[[princes]] (or boy [[monarch]]) in [[early modern Europe]], who received [[corporal punishment]] for the prince's transgressions in his presence.  The prince was not punished himself because his royal status exceeded that of his tutor; seeing a friend punished would provide an equivalent motivation not to repeat the offence. An archaic proverb which captures a similar idea is "to beat a dog before a lion".&lt;ref&gt;Wesselski 1928, p.127 [German equivalent: "den Hund vor dem Löwen schlagen"]; {{cite book |last=Chaucer |first=Geoffrey |editor=Donald C.

There is little contemporary evidence for the existence of whipping boys, and evidence that some princes were indeed whipped by their tutors, although [[Nicholas Orme]] suggests that nobles might have been beaten less often than other pupils.&lt;ref&gt;Orme 2017 pp.33–35&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians regard whipping boys as entirely mythical; others suggest they applied only in the case of a boy king, protected by [[divine right of kings|divine right]], and not to mere princes.&lt;ref name="Ridley2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ridley|first=Jasper|title=A Brief History of the Tudor Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yKfBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT137|accessdate=5 January 2018|date=2013-02-07|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=9781472107954|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Renaissance humanism]], [[Erasmus]]' treatises "[[The Education of a Christian Prince]]" (1516) and "Declamatio de pueris statim ac liberaliter instituendis" (1530) mention the inappropriateness of physical chastisement of princes, but do not mention proxy punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Bushnell 1996 p.50&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hartley Coleridge]] wrote in 1852, "to be flogged by proxy was the exclusive privilege of royal blood. ... It was much coveted for the children of the poorer [[gentry]], as the first step in the ladder of preferment."&lt;ref name="ColeridgeColeridge1852"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Hartley|last2=Coleridge|first2=Derwent|last3=Coleridge|first3=Samuel Taylor|title=Lives of northern worthies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3EcEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA172|accessdate=9 January 2018|year=1852|publisher=Edward Moxon|page=172, fn}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Gough Nichols]] wrote in 1857, "the whole matter is somewhat legendary, and though certain vicarious or rather minatory punishments may have been occasionally adopted, it does not seem likely that any one individual among the King's schoolfellows should have been uniformly selected, whether he were in fault or not, as the victim or scape-goat of the royal misdemeanours".&lt;ref name="Nichols1857"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nichols|first=John Gough |authorlink=John Gough Nichols|title=Literary Remains of King Edward the Sixth: Edited from His Autograph Manuscripts, with Historical Notes and a Biographical Memoir|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=7TUJAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR69|accessdate=18 January 2018|year=1857|publisher=J.

==In later literature==
[[Samuel Rowley]]'s 1604 play ''[[When You See Me You Know Me]]'' depicts the childhood of the future Edward VI. When he skips class to play [[real tennis|tennis]], Edward "Ned" Browne is sent to the chapel to be whipped by the master of children. [[Thomas Cranmer|Cranmer]] says, "Since he was whipped thus for the prince's faults. / His grace hath got more knowledge in a month. / Than he attained in a year before, / For still the fearful boy, to save his breech, / Doth hourly haunt him, wheresoe'er he goes." The prince persuades king [[Henry VIII]] to knight Ned: "the poor gentleman was pitifully wounded in the back parts, as may appear by the scar, if his knightship would but untruss there". Ned hopes the tutors will refrain from whipping a knight, to which the [[jester|fool]] retorts, "If they do, he shall make thee a [[Peerage of England|lord]], and then they dare not." This work may have helped the idea of a whipping boy to take root.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowley |first=Samuel|editor-last=Elze |editor-first=Karl|title=When you see me, you know me.
