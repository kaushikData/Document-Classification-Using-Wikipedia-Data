The '''1994 expanded World Health Organization AIDS case definition''' came around through the developments in the understanding of the spectrum of severe HIV-related illness both in developed and developing countries, and the increased availability of laboratory diagnostic methods, a meeting was convened in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] by the [[World Health Organization]] Global Programme on [[AIDS]] to review the [[1985 World Health Organization AIDS surveillance case definition]] (''Bangui definition'') and to modify and expand them for use in adults and adolescents. Both the 1985 World Health Organization AIDS surveillance case definition and the 1994 expanded World Health Organization AIDS case definition are case definitions for AIDS surveillance and not for clinically staging [[HIV]] infection.

The main change from the ''Bangui definition'' is the addition of an HIV [[HIV test|test]] for HIV [[antibody]]. If this test gives a positive result and one or more of the following conditions, the individual is considered to have AIDS.

* &gt; 10% body weight loss or cachexia, with [[diarrhoea]] or [[fever]], or both, intermittent or constant for at least 1 month, not known to be due to a condition unrelated to HIV infection.
* cryptococcal [[meningitis]]
* pulmonary or extra-pulmonary [[tuberculosis]]
* [[Kaposi's sarcoma]]
* neurological impairment that is sufficient to prevent independent daily activities, not known to be due to a condition unrelated to HIV infection (for example, trauma, or cerebrovascular accident).
* [[candidiasis]] of the oesophagus (which may be presumptively diagnosed based on the presence of oral candidiasis accompanied by dysphagia.
* clinically diagnosed life-threatening or recurrent episodes of pneumonia, with or without etiological confirmation
* invasive cervical cancer

'''4,4'-Thiodianiline''' (TDA) is an [[aromatic amine]] which is presumed to be [[carcinogen]]ic to humans.

== Chemical structure and properties ==
TDA is not combustible, but when heated it may decompose to form irritating and toxic fumes.  An analogue of TDA is [[dapsone]].

== Synthesis ==
[[Sulfur]] is boiled in excess [[aniline]] over several hours to produce three isomers (1,1'; 1,4; 4,4') of TDA.&lt;ref name=Hodgson&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hodgson |first=Herbert Henry|date= |title=Direct sulphuration of aniline |url=http://pubs.rsc.org/is/content/articlelanding/1924/ct/ct9242501855#!divAbstract |journal=J. Chem. Soc., Trans. |publisher= |volume=1924 |issue=125 |pages=1855–1858|doi=10.1039/CT9242501855  |access-date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same journal documents syntheses of similar and overlapping compounds by Merz and Weith in 1871, and K. A. Hoffman in 1894. A study by Nietzki and Bothof&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nietzki|first1=R|last2=Bothof|first2=Heinrich|title=The Understanding of Thioanilines|journal=Reports of the German Chemical Society|volume=27|issue=3|pages=3261–3263|year=1894|publisher=Wiley-VCH|doi=10.1002/cber.189402703119|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cber.189402703119/abstract|access-date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows indications that including an oxide of lead may maximize the yield of the 4,4' variant that this page refers to.

== Uses ==
TDA was used as a chemical intermediate in the production of three dyes: CI mordant yellow 16, milling red G and milling red FR, as well as the medicine [[Dapsone]].

==Production==
TDA is no longer produced in the USA.

==Toxicity==
TDA has caused mutations in some strains of ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]'' and has caused tumors in laboratory mice and rats.

'''Anthony Costello''' (born 20 February 1953) is a British paediatrician. Until 2015. Costello was Professor of International Child Health and Director of the Institute for Global Health at the [[University College London]]. Costello was most notable for his work on improving survival among mothers and their newborn infants in poor populations of developing countries.

==Life==
Costello was born in [[Beckenham]], and graduated from school at [[St Joseph's Academy, Blackheath|St Joseph's Academy]]. Costello attended [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]] where he took a degree in Experimental Psychology and qualified as a doctor in Medical Sciences after clinical training at the [[Middlesex Hospital]] in London.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web |title=International MNCA expert named as Director, WHO Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health |url=http://www.who.int/life-course/news/new-mca-director/en/ |website=World Health Organization |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=8 July 2018 |location=GENEVA, SWITZERLAND |date=Jun 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then trained in Paediatrics and Neonatology at [[University College London]].

He and his wife, Helen, have two sons, Harry and Ned, and one daughter, Freya.&lt;ref name="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60929-6/fulltext"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Honigsbaum|first1=Mark|title=Anthony Costello: making climate change part of global health|journal=The Lancet|date=16 May 2009|volume=373|issue=9676|page=1669|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60929-6|url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60929-6/fulltext|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2016}}
After living in Baglung district in western Nepal from 1984–1986, two days walk from a road, he became fascinated by challenges to mother and child health in poor, remote populations. His areas of scientific expertise include the evaluation of cost-effective interventions to reduce maternal and newborn deaths, women’s groups, strategies to tackle malnutrition, international aid and the health effects of climate change. In 1999 he published a pioneering book on how to improve newborn infant health in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;1999: Improving Newborn Infant Health in Developing Countries. Imperial and World Scientific Press. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

With a Nepali organisation (MIRA), that he helped to establish, a large community trial of participatory learning and action using women’s groups in the remote mountains of Makwanpur district, Nepal was published in The Lancet in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;2004: Effect of a participatory intervention with women's groups on birth outcomes in Nepal: cluster-randomised controlled trial. 2004 Lancet 364: 970–99.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to establish partnerships and further studies with local organisations in eastern India, Mumbai, Bangladesh and Malawi. Seven cluster randomised controlled trials of women’s groups in Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Malawi, led to a meta-analysis published in the Lancet in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;2013: Women's groups practising participatory learning and action to improve maternal and newborn health in resource-limited settings: systematic review and meta-analysis. Lancet 2013 May 18;381(9879): 1736-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Results showed that in populations where more than 30% of pregnant women joined the women's group programme, maternal death and newborn deaths were cut by one third. The intervention has now been recommended by the World Health Organisation for scale-up in poor, rural populations.&lt;ref&gt;2014: WHO recommendation on community mobilization through facilitated participatory learning and action cycles with women's groups for maternal and newborn health. World Health Organization; {{ISBN|978 92 4 150727 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Costello chaired the 2009 Lancet Commission on Managing the Health Effects of Climate Change,&lt;ref&gt;2009: Managing the health effects of climate change: Lancet and University College London Institute for Global Health Commission.  Lancet. 2009 May 16; 373(9676): 1693-1733.&lt;/ref&gt; and was co-chair of a new Lancet Commission which links the UK, China, Norway and Sweden on emergency actions to tackle the climate health crisis, published in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60854-6/abstract|title=Health and climate change: policy responses to protect public health|first1=Nick|last1=Watts|first2=W.

At WHO he has helped to lead the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health (2016‒2030) with its three objectives of survive, thrive and transform – to end preventable mortality, to promote health and well-being, and to expand enabling environments. Its guiding principles include equity, universality, human rights, development effectiveness and sustainability.

With the WHO team he has also launched the global accelerated action for the health of adolescents (AA-HA!) and established an expert review group called  Maternal and Newborn Information for tracking Outcomes and Results (MONITOR) to harmonize maternal and newborn health indicators.

In February 2017, together with UNICEF and UNFPA  he helped to launched the Network for Improving Quality of Care for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health to introduce evidence-based interventions to improve quality of care for maternal and newborn health supported by a learning system. The Network involves Ethiopia, Nigeria, India, Bangladesh, Malawi, Côte d'Ivoire, Uganda, Tanzania and Ghana. He also leads work on community empowerment for family health - what it means, how to measure it, and how to plan interventions at district level.

With the Lancet he is a co-chair of their new Countdown Commission on Climate Change which reports progress annually on climate change adaptation, mitigation, economics, energy policy and public engagement. With UNICEF he is helping WHO to coordinate a new Lancet Commission on redesigning child health for the Sustainable Development Goals era.

'''Buffaloe v. Hart''', 114 N.C. App. 52 (1994) was a [[North Carolina Court of Appeals]] case dealing with a [[breach of contract]]. 

==Background==
Homer Buffaloe verbally agreed to buy five [[Tobacco barn|tobacco barns]] in [[Franklin County, North Carolina|Franklin County]] from Lowell Thomas Hart and Patricia Hart. Buffaloe had previously rented the barns the barns based on verbal agreements. Both parties agreed to sell the barns in four annual installments based on a [[handshake deal]] without any written documentation. Buffaloe sent them a [[personal check]] with the purpose written in the subject line but they sent it back to him as they had found a buyer willing to pay more. Buffaloe sued for breach of contract.

==Decision==
According to ''Buffaloe'', part performance on one party's behalf can trump the [[statute of frauds]] requirements outlined in the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] which requires the contract be in writing. In [[contract law]], the sale of goods exceeding $500 is governed by the UCC. Additionally, the UCC calls for a [[contract|written agreement]] to accompany the sale of goods in certain instances. The jury found that

'''Calvin C.J. Sia''' (born '''Calvin Chia Jung Sia''' on June 3, 1927) is a [[primary care]] pediatrician from [[Hawaii]] who developed innovative programs to improve the quality of medical care for children in the United States and Asia. Two particular programs have been implemented throughout America: the [[Medical home|Medical Home]] concept for primary care that has been promoted by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.aap.org/member/spotlight-sia.htm |title=AAP MEMBER SPOTLIGHT |publisher=Aap.org |accessdate=23 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810031640/http://www2.aap.org/member/spotlight-sia.htm |archivedate=10 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palfrey"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZuVbzss5WoC&amp;pg=PA40 |title=Child Health in America|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the federal [[Emergency Medical Services for Children]] program administered by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]’ [[Health Resources and Services Administration]], [[Maternal and Child Health Bureau]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309048885|title=Emergency Medical Services for Children|publisher=Nap.edu|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Medical Home model for pediatric care and early childhood development began to take root in several Asian countries in 2003.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cds.hawaii.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/ausp/ausp3/pdf/AUSPIII_FinalReport.pdf |format=PDF|title=Asia-US Partnership 2006: Early Child Development in Primary Care |date=2006|publisher=Department of Pediatrics, John A.

Sia is also creator of Hawaii Healthy Start Home Visiting Program to prevent child abuse and neglect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/114/3/e317.abstract|title=Hawaii's Healthy Start Home Visiting Program: Determinants and Impact of Rapid Repeat Birth|author=Samer S.

The Hawaii Healthy Start program, which targets expecting and new parents who may be at risk of abusing or neglecting their children, became the model for the Healthy Families America home visiting program that the [[United States Department of Justice]]'s [[Office of Justice Programs]] identified in 2010 as a "promising" approach to child abuse prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crimesolutions.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?ID=200 |title=Program: Healthy Families America |publisher=CrimeSolutions.gov |date=2011-09-23 |accessdate=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Healthy and Ready to Learn Center was a three-year pilot project to initiate training and health delivery services in an integrated system of care, with pediatric residents and graduate students in social work and early childhood education working as a team.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clas.uiuc.edu/fulltext/cl00910/cl00910.html|title=CLAS: Building Bridges: Lessons Learned in Interprofessional Collaboration|publisher=Clas.uiuc/edu|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Sia spearheaded the creation of the Variety School for learning disabled children, a Honolulu-based educational institution for children ages 5 through 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://varietyschool.org/about.html|title=Variety School of Hawaii|publisher=Varietyschool.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sia retired from his Honolulu-based medical practice in 1996, after almost 40 years of treating patients,&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/96/10/30/news/story2.html|title=The godfather and the grandfather|last=Altonn|first=Helen|date=October 30, 1996|website=|publisher=Archives.starbulletin.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but continues to promote Medical Home and community pediatrics as professor of Pediatrics at the [[University of Hawaii]] [[John A.

==Education==
Sia is a 1945 graduate of [[Punahou School]] in [[Honolulu]] and a graduate of [[Dartmouth College]] in 1950. He received his medical degree at [[Western Reserve University School of Medicine]] in 1955 and did a general rotating internship as a lieutenant in the [[U.S. Army Medical Corps]] at [[William Beaumont Army Hospital]] in El Paso, Texas from 1955-1956. Sia then served his pediatric residency under Dr. Irvine McQuarrie at Kauikeolani Children's Hospital in Honolulu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/90/3/419|title=Abraham Jacobi Award Address, April 14, 1992 The Medical Home: Pediatric Practice and Child Advocacy in the 1990s|publisher=Pediatrics.aappublications.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and obtained his license to practice medicine in Hawaii in 1958. He was certified by the American Board of Pediatrics in 1960 and recertified in 1987. The [[University of Hawaii]] awarded Sia an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hawaii.edu/offices/bor/honorary.php|title=Honorary degrees conferred by the University of Hawaii|publisher=Hawaii.edu|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public service==

===Early years===
As a young practicing pediatrician, Sia joined the early cadre of American Academy of Pediatrics consultants for Head Start and Parent Child Centers in Hawaii in the 1960s and developed a strong interest in prenatal, neonatal, and postnatal causes of physical and mental disabilities in children. In a paper he presented in 1964 to the Hawaii Academy of Sciences on advances in neonatology, Sia cited progress in the care of premature babies but also noted that "completeness" of the first physical exam and the education of nurses to be on the alert for early signs of disabilities were possible ways to save newborns with previously lethal birth defects. He concluded by observing, "One of the basic problems will be in solving the causes and prevention of prematurity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sia|first=Calvin C.J.|date=1964|title=Advances in neonatology|url=https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10524/2159/PHAS1964.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Hawaiian Academy of Science|volume=|pages=16-17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by one of his mentors, Dr. Robert E. Cooke, the Johns Hopkins pediatrician behind the creation of the Hopkins hospital's Kennedy Institute for Handicapped Children, Sia helped establish Hawaii's Variety School for Learning Disabilities in 1967 and served as chairman of its board of directors for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiiaap.org/pdfs/AAP%20Member%20Spotlight%20Article%20-%20Sia_HS%203%202010_1_.pdf |format=PDF |title=Calvin C.J. Sia, MD, FAAP - Resume |publisher=Hawaiiaap.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sia broadened the scope of his community work to address all children with special health care needs. In the early 1970s, he invited Dr. [[C. Henry Kempe]], founder of the Denver-based National Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Child Abuse and Neglect, and Dr. Ray E. Helfer of Michigan—two pioneers in the identification and treatment of child abuse—to help him and a small group of child advocates develop a plan to prevent and treat child abuse and neglect in the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles/hawaiihs.txt |format=TXT |title=Helping to Prevent Child Abuse -- and Future Criminal Consequences: Hawai'i Healthy Start |publisher=Ncjrs.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; That effort netted one of the first 12 demonstration grant awards by the newly created National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect in 1975, with $1 million going to establish the first Hawaii Family Stress Center. The center, later renamed the Hawaii Family Support Center, established several child abuse and neglect programs on Oahu, including a home-visiting program based on Kempe's effective use of "lay therapists." These were home visitors from the community, properly trained and supervised by public health nurses and social workers who could earn the trust of at-risk families and focus on family strengths to reduce environmental risk and prevent child abuse and neglect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futureofchildren.org/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=49&amp;articleid=246&amp;sectionid=1609|title= - The Future of Children -|author=Princeton University|publisher=Futureofchildren.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="princeton.edu"&gt;The Future of Children (Princeton University-Brookings Institution), Home Visiting: Recent Program Evaluations, "Evaluation of Hawaii's Healthy Start Program," by Anne K. Duggan, Sc.D, et al., Vol. 9 No. 1, Spring-Summer 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The center's goal was to identify vulnerable families before their day-to-day stresses, isolation, and lack of parenting knowledge and good role models gave rise to abusive and neglectful behavior.

The center's operations coincided with an effort launched by Dr. Vince L. Hutchins and Dr. Merle McPherson of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau in 1977 to revise and update the
mission of the federal agency's Title V and companion "crippled children's" programs to address child development and the prevention of developmental, behavioral and psychosocial problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fv-ncfpp.org/index.php/download_file/view/465/95/ |format=PDF |title=Celebrate 2010 |publisher=Fv-ncfpp.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; McPherson took note of Sia's call for a continuous system of care originating with the primary care pediatrician.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/Supplement_4/1473.long|title=History of the Medical Home Concept|work=aappublications.org|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAP collaborated in this effort by asking each state’s AAP chapter to develop a Child Health Plan that set priorities for using MCHB block grants. Sia spearheaded the Hawaii planning effort, bringing together representatives from the Hawaii AAP Chapter, the UH medical school, the Hawaii Medical Association, and [[Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children]]. Armed with anecdotal evidence showing home visitors were able to promote
effective parenting and ultimately improve outcomes, the group wrote a plan that incorporated a coordinated system of care that emphasized wellness and prevention for
children, especially those with special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.lww.com/iycjournal/Abstract/2003/10000/Building_Medical_Homes_for_Children_With_Special.6.aspx|title=Building Medical Homes for Children With Special Health Care... : Infants &amp; Young Children|work=LWW|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the birth of the Medical Home concept for primary care,&lt;ref&gt;[http://facm.unjbg.edu.pe/revistaspediatria/Clinical%20Pediatrics/2009/August/16%20The%20Medical%20Home-Improving%20Quality%20of%20Primary%20Care%20for%20Children.pdf] {{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which Sia attached the slogan, “Every Child Deserves a Medical Home.” Under this idea, which the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] adopted as a policy statement in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/110/1/184|title=The Medical Home|work=aappublications.org|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the medical care of all infants, children and adolescents should be accessible, continuous, comprehensive, family-centered, coordinated, compassionate, and culturally effective.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amchp.org/AboutAMCHP/Newsletters/Pulse/Archive/2010/April2010/Pages/article.aspx|title=From the Presidents|publisher=Amchp.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be delivered or directed by well-trained physicians who provide primary care and help to manage and facilitate essentially all aspects of pediatric care. The physician should be known to the child and family and should be able to develop a partnership of mutual responsibility and trust with them. As Sia and his co-authors of a 2006 monograph on the Medical Home noted, this new model broadens the traditional focus on acute care to include prevention and well care at one end of the continuum and chronic care management of children with special health care needs at the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aap.org/commpeds/CPTI/MedicalHome2006.pdf]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccic.acf.hhs.gov/node/33969|title=The Medical Home and Early Child Development in Primary Care|last=|first=|date=2006|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027080143/http://nccic.acf.hhs.gov/node/33969|archivedate=October 27, 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One expert observed, for example, that for a child born with [[spina bifida]], Sia's Medical Home model would have the family and its health care provider compose a list of specialists and therapists who would be caring for the child and a timeline of anticipated surgeries and interventions. The aim would be to have as few emergencies and unanticipated events as possible.&lt;ref name="Palfrey" /&gt;

As the lead author of an often-cited article published by the journal [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] in May 2004, Sia traced the development of the Medical Home concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/Supplement_4/1473.long|title=History of the Medical Home Concept|author=Calvin Sia|publisher=Pedriatrics.aappublications.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pilot programs===
By 1984, Sia had begun to implement the Medical Home concept in Hawaii. As chairman of an ad hoc state legislative task force on child abuse, he persuaded Hawaii lawmakers to authorize the Hawaii Healthy Start Home Visiting Program for the prevention of child abuse and neglect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; This state-funded pilot program, carried out by Hawaii Family Support Center in collaboration with the Hawaii Department of Health, focused on a neighborhood in the Ewa community on Oahu, a community with relatively high rates of child abuse and neglect.&lt;ref name="princeton.edu"/&gt; A year later, he spearheaded the Hawaii Medical Association's effort to obtain a grant from the U.S. [[Maternal and Child Health Bureau]], under the Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS) initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://perfdata.hrsa.gov/mchb/mchreports/LEARN_More/Block_Grant_Program/block_grant_program.asp|title=Block Grant Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115044032/https://perfdata.hrsa.gov/mchb/mchreports//LEARN_More/Block_Grant_Program/block_grant_program.asp|archivedate=January 15, 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to train primary care physicians to provide a "Medical Home" for all children with special health care needs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/Supplement_4/1473.full.pdf |format=PDF |title=History of the Medical Home Concept |publisher=Pediatrics.aappublications.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstration project—which sought to help first-time families give their newborn children the best start in life—was so successful it was expanded from a small part of [[Oahu]] to other areas of Hawaii, and as word of the demonstrated positive outcomes spread, Hawaii’s Healthy Start became a model for parenting education programs nationwide.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; In the early 1990s, Healthy Families America and the National Healthy Start Association began to standardize and credential programs to ensure effectiveness and research-based practices. Across the United States, according to the MCHB, the home visiting program has shown that it can reduce child maltreatment and increase children’s readiness for school.

Meanwhile, Sia launched the Hawaii Early Intervention Program for infants and toddlers in 1986 and also became actively involved with Hawaii’s Early Intervention Coordinating Council for Zero to Three, placing this under Hawaii’s Department of Health instead of the Department of Education.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;  The focus of this effort was to support the Medical Home system of care with prevention and early intervention programs.

===Implementation===
At a June 1987 conference called by [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[C. Everett Koop]] and sponsored by the AAP and MCHB to address children with special needs, Sia and his delegation from Hawaii made a presentation of the Medical Home concept. Koop appeared to embrace it by issuing a report that endorsed a system of family-centered, community-based, coordinated care for children with special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/83/6/1055|title=Family-Centered, Community-Based, Coordinated Care for Children With Special Health Care Needs|author=Earl J. Brewer Jr|publisher=Pedriatics.aappublications.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1989 by the first National Medical Home Conference, which drew 26 AAP state chapters to Hawaii for presentations organized by Sia and MCHB officials on how to train pediatricians in the Medical Home system of care. This led to consultations to introduce the Medical Home training program to interdisciplinary teams of pediatricians, families, and other health care–related professionals in Florida, Minnesota, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Washington and other states.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The pace of activity prompted Sia to close his private medical practice in 1996 so he could devote his time as principal investigator on various early childhood grant projects promoting the Medical Home and its integrated system of care. He launched several initiatives with a MCHB Health Education Collaboration grant in support of interprofessional training in early childhood, a [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] Starting Points planning grant in early childhood, and Consuelo Foundation of Hawaii's Healthy and Ready to Learn grant–all with the emphasis on integrating the continuum of care of the Medical Home with other health, family, and community services from a holistic approach.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; The MCHB funding enabled him to travel across the country to promote the Medical Home concept to various
communities, state AAP chapters, family advocacy groups and state Title V maternal and child health officers.

A three-year pilot project creating a Healthy and Ready to Learn Center in Hawaii began in 1992 and helped gauge the effectiveness of Sia's family-centered interprofessional collaboration approach.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Lessons learned from this project were subsequently adopted by the Office of Children and Youth of the Governor's Office of Hawaii with Sia as Co-Principal Investigator.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; The Carnegie Corp. Starting Points grant then was assumed by the Good Beginnings Alliance in Hawaii.

Sia, serving as chairman of the American Medical Association's Section Council on Pediatrics and other AMA- and AAP-related posts, used those platforms and his network of contacts with other groups to help introduce the Medical Home concept into the care of adults&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/391/1177/EvidenceReport208_ClosingTheQualityGap-Patient-Centered-Medical-Home_ExecutiveSummary_20120703.pdf |format=PDF |title=2. The Patient-Centered Medical Home Closing the Quality Gap: Revisiting the State of the Science : Executive Summary |publisher=Effectibvehealthcare.ahrq.gov |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as children, although his primary focus has remained on pediatric care. In 2007, the AAP, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Physicians and the [[American Osteopathic Association]] adopted the Joint Principles of the Patient-Centered Medical Home that set a standard definition of a Medical Home. A year later, the AMA adopted the principles, which have since received support from over 700 member organizations of the [[Patient Centered Primary Care Collaborative]], including primary care and specialty care societies, all major health plans and consumer organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nccp.org/publications/pdf/text_1041.pdf |format=PDF |title=Pediatric Medical Homes : Laying the Foundation of a Promising Model of Care |publisher=Nccp.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the term Medical Home now regularly shows up in the literature of parent groups such as Family Voices, in family practice journals and on the websites of state public health and medical agencies.&lt;ref name="Palfrey" /&gt;

===Focus on Asia===

Beginning in 2000, Sia expanded his efforts related to early child development and the Medical Home to Asia. In 2003, he created the Asia-US Partnership, a think tank based at the University of Hawaii medical school whose mission is to improve child health in Asia and the United States through cross-cultural
exchanges with leaders in pediatrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cds.hawaii.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/ausp/ausp1/pdf/AUSP1_report.pdf |format=PDF |title=Early Child Development in Primary Care |publisher=Cds.hawaii.edu |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Sia initiated and chaired the first of several AUSP Early Child Development and Primary Care conferences, bringing together pediatric and early childhood development experts from Asia and the United States to translate the science of early child development into policy and action. Participants have come from China (Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong), the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand and the United States. According to conference reports, these international exchanges have stimulated translation of the science on early child development and primary care into action programs in the broad areas of advocacy, service delivery, research, and training among the Asian early childhood professionals leadership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Sia has continued to serve as co-chairman of these events, including the sixth international conference, held in the Philippines capital of Manila, in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cds.hawaii.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/ausp/ausp6/pdf/AUSPVI_BriefingBook.pdf |format=PDF |title=Briefing Book : Asia-US Partnership 2011 : Early Childhood Development in Primary Care |publisher=Cds.hawaii.edu |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After hosting the earliest AUSP conferences in Hawaii, Sia decided to move the 2009 event to Shanghai and tapped a team of Chinese doctors to serve as conference host, signaling what he called a new phase of activity aimed at developing greater shared leadership and stronger "country teams."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cds.hawaii.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/ausp/ausp5/pdf/AUSPV_FinalReport.pdf |format=PDF |title=Asia-US Partnership 2011 : Early Childhood Development in Primary Care |publisher=Cds.hawaii.edu |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pediatric emergency medicine===
While planting the seeds of the Medical Home concept in Hawaii, Sia embarked on a related advocacy campaign focused on emergency care for children. In 1979, as president of the Hawaii Medical Association, Sia urged members of the American Academy of Pediatrics to develop multifaceted Emergency Medical Services programs designed to decrease disability and death in children. By January 1981, AAP's Executive Board had approved formation of a Section on Emergency Medicine, with Sia as one of its seven charter members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.aap.org/sections/pem/25AnniversaryBookletFinal.pdf |format=PDF |title=The AAP Section on Emergency Medicine |publisher=2.aap.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He along with José B. Lee then-executive officer of the Hawaii Medical Association Emergency Medical Services Program began working closely with Senator [[Daniel Inouye]], whom he happened to meet on a flight to Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref name="Palfrey" /&gt; to create a National Emergency Medical Services for Children System ([[Emergency Medical Services for Children|EMSC]]) demonstration grant program to address acute injuries, illnesses and other childhood crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oDI8Rxe34U8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=Calvin%20Sia&amp;f=false|title=APLS : the Pediatric Emergency Medicine Resource|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was launched after the October 1984 enactment of EMSC legislation (Public Law 98-555), a bipartisan measure sponsored by Inouye and Republican Senators [[Orrin Hatch]] of Utah and [[Lowell Weicker]] of Connecticut and endorsed by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.ny.gov/nysdoh/ems/emsc/index.htm|title=Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC)|publisher=Health.ny.gov|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrensnational.org/files/PDF/EMSC/EMSC_An_Historical_Perspective.pdf|title=EMSC: an historical perspective|last=|first=|date=|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203204651/http://www.childrensnational.org/files/PDF/EMSC/EMSC_An_Historical_Perspective.pdf|archivedate=February 3, 2012|deadurl=yes|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; States receiving these demonstration grants established an emergency medical care service system for children that upgraded training and equipment for first responders and emergency departments to treat children. Hawaii ultimately received a grant to initiate its own emergency care system for children, which improved care coordination with the primary care physician. EMSC is now an established statewide system of care for children in all 50 states and territories.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5531">'''Catch the Sperm''' is a Swiss computer game recognized as an entertaining way for health professionals to promote prevention of [[HIV]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/MeetingAbstracts/102251219.html Catch the Sperm: computer game on the internet for AIDS prevention], ''Int Conf AIDS''. 2002 Jul 7-12; 14: abstract no. TuPeF5284.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Catch the Sperm (now known as CTS Style I) is a 3.4-megabite action game created in 2001 and updated in 2002 and 2003 by Phenomedia for the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health's Stop AIDS Campaign. The game can be played on a [[personal computer]], a [[mobile telephone]], or a [[cellular telephone]].

The game was designed for free international distribution. Copyright of the Catch The Sperm series is owned by Scandinavian Games [http://www.games.is].

== Various versions ==
Catch the Sperm is available in seven versions:
* CTS Style 1 (2001)
* CTS Style 2 (2002)
* Duel (2003)
* Carnival (2003)
* Summer (2003)
* Swiss Soccer (2003)
* Christmas (2003).

Each version has its own theme, [[spermatozoon|sperm]] characters, [[virus]] [[villain]]s, and screen graphics, some of which seem to have been designed to [[parody]] the original images [https://web.archive.org/web/20060831224008/http://www.cueni.ch/blackpencil/catchthesperm/cts1_page.html].

=== CTS Style 1 ===
The original Catch the Sperm (CTS Style 1) was created in 2001. It is set within the interior of a [[vagina]] or a [[rectum]] and the game commences amid orgasmic moans and groans. The characters are a Neutral Sperm, a Dual Techno Sperm, and a Precious Sperm. Various viruses are included as the villains.

=== CTS Style 2 ===
CTS Style 2 is a 2002 update of the original Catch the Sperm game. Set in a blue environment that is ambiguous enough so that it could represent either the ocean depths or outer space, it features a  Frozen Sperm, a Supersperm, a Fool Sperm, a Jungle Sperm, an I-Sperm, and a Jurassic Precious Sperm.

=== Carnival ===
The Carnival edition of Catch the Sperm is set against a background of what appears to be surreal paintings and includes drifting balloons and floating strands of [[confetti]], some of which are spiral shaped like uncoiling [[DNA]] [[double helix]]es. The characters are a [[Waggis]], a Joker, a Sambina, a Lipstick, a Clown, and Gold, Silver, and Bronze Sperm. There are six [[virus]]es.

=== Summer ===
The Summer edition of Catch the Sperm is set in a sunny [[Caribbean]] ocean of light blue water, flowering underwater plants, and bright sunshine. The characters are a [[Submarine]], an [[Orca]], a Swimmer, a Water, and a Diver Sperm. As with the Carnival edition, the Summer version also includes six viruses.

=== Christmas ===
The [[Christmas]] edition of Catch the Sperm is a winter landscape over which the sperm characters fly rather than swim. As they travel through the frosty night, they pass illuminated and decorated Christmas trees, lit candles, bows, and icicles. The characters are a Chocolate Sperm that, as its name suggests, resembles milk chocolate; a bearded [[Santa Claus]] Sperm, wearing a red stocking hat with a white pompom and a red flannel body suit; a Cold Sperm, wearing a blue-and-green stocking cap and matching earmuffs; a white Snowy Sperm, wearing a black top hat; and a Wrapped Sperm that is decorated with a bright red bow.

== International versions ==
In addition, Catch the Sperm is available in many foreign language additions, including [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].

== Object ==
To protect the couple who are having sex, the player shoots condoms from an imaginary gun that can be moved up or down along the right edge of the screen to align with oncoming threats. If the condoms find their targets, they snare [[spermatozoon|sperm]] cells and the [[AIDS]] virus.

== Scoring ==
A player loses 50 points each time that his or her sperm gun is fired, but players accumulate 100 points for snaring sperm cells, additional points for trapping viruses, and bonus points for snaring special sperm. At some point in the play, the AIDS virus [[viral mutation|mutates]], and play speeds up rapidly. The player may allow any number of sperm to slip past, although this will result in a lower score, but to allow even a single virus to speed past is to lose the game &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamemobile.co.uk/catchthesperm.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903194426/http://www.gamemobile.co.uk/catchthesperm.htm |archivedate=2006-09-03 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Winning ==
Upon successfully completing a game, player are rewarded with a special "Congratulations" screen before embarking on the next level of play. He or she can also visit an [[Internet]] [[web site]] whereupon the player can post his or her score if it is among the highest of all other players.  The world's top three players of the week receive a Catch the Sperm [[mouse pad]] inside of which mock sperm swim in a liquid.

'''Cellular agriculture''' focuses on the production of agriculture products from cell cultures using a combination of [[biotechnology]], [[tissue engineering]], [[molecular biology]], and [[synthetic biology]] to create and design new methods of producing proteins, fats, and tissues that would otherwise come from traditional agriculture.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://agfundernews.com/closer-look-cellular-agriculture-and-the-processes-defining-it.html|title=A Closer Look at Cellular Agriculture and the Processes Defining It - AgFunderNews|date=2016-07-05|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to the creation of animal products such as meat, milk, and eggs, produced in cell culture rather than raising and slaughtering farmed livestock.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00963402.2017.1413059|title=Cellular agriculture: The coming revolution in food production|journal = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|pages = 32–35|volume = 74|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/00963402.2017.1413059|first = CS|last = Mattick|pmid=10659856|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most well known cellular agriculture concept is [[cultured meat]].

== History ==
{{Main|Timeline of cellular agriculture}}

Although cellular agriculture is a nascent scientific discipline, cellular agriculture products were first commercialized in the early 20th century with insulin and rennet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.new-harvest.org/about|title=About|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, 1990, the FDA approved a bacteria that had been genetically engineered to produce rennet, making it the first genetically engineered product for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-24/news/mn-681_1_genetically-engineered-product-for-food|title=FDA approves 1st genetically engineered product for food|last=|first=|date=1990-03-24|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rennet is a mixture of enzymes that turns milk into curds and whey in cheese making.  Traditionally, rennet is extracted from the inner lining of the fourth stomach of calves. Today, cheese making processes use rennet enzymes from genetically engineered bacteria, fungi, or yeasts because they are unadulterated, more consistent, and less expensive than animal-derived rennet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncbe.reading.ac.uk/ncbe/gmfood/chymosin.html|title=Case Studies: Chymosin|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522102627/http://www.ncbe.reading.ac.uk/ncbe/gmfood/chymosin.html|archivedate=2016-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Jason Gaverick Matheny|Jason Matheny]] founded [[New Harvest]] which was initially a cultured-meat advocacy organization whose mission today is to "accelerate breakthroughs in cellular agriculture."&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.new-harvest.org/about|title=History|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Harvest is the only organization focused exclusively on advancing the field of cellular agriculture and is funding the first cellular agriculture PhD at Tufts University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.new-harvest.org/cellular_agriculture_tufts_university|title=Cellular Agriculture at Tufts University.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2014, ''IndieBio'', a synthetic biology accelerator in San Francisco, has incubated several cellular agriculture startups, hosting Muufri (making milk from cell culture), Clara Foods (making egg whites from cell culture), Gelzen (making gelatin from bacteria and yeast), Afineur (making cultured coffee beans) and Pembient (biofabricating rhino horn). Muufri and Clara Foods were both launched by New Harvest.

In 2015, ''[[Mercy for Animals]]'' created its sister organization called ''[[The Good Food Institute|Good Food Institute]]'', which promotes cellular agriculture meat and dairy alternatives in addition to plant-based options.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vegnews.com/articles/page.do?pageId=7568&amp;catId=1|title=News article|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 13, 2016, New Harvest hosted the world's first international conference on cellular agriculture in San Francisco, California.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The day after the conference, New Harvest hosted the first closed-door workshop for industry, academic and government stakeholders in cellular agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@NewHarvestOrg/notes-from-the-2016-cellular-agriculture-innovators-workshop-c97d4df4eabb#.dow8i6r2m|title=Notes from the 2016 Cellular Agriculture Innovators’ Workshop|last=Harvest|first=New|date=2016-08-04|website=Medium|access-date=2016-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research tools ==
Several key research tools are at the foundation of research in cellular agriculture. These include:

=== Cell lines ===
A fundamental missing piece in the advancement of cultured meat is the availability of the appropriate cellular materials. While some methods and protocols from human and mouse cell culture may apply to agricultural cellular materials, it has become clear that most do not. This is evidenced by the fact that established protocols for creating human and mouse embryonic stem cells have not succeeded in establishing ungulate embryonic stem cell lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007|title=Challenges and prospects for the establishment of embryonic stem cells of domesticated ungulates|journal=Animal Reproduction Science|volume=98|issue=|doi=10.1016/j.anireprosci.2006.10.009|pmid=17097839|via=|pages=147–68 | last1 = Keefer | first1 = CL | last2 = Pant | first2 = D | last3 = Blomberg | first3 = L | last4 = Talbot | first4 = NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008|title=The pursuit of ES cell lines of domesticated ungulates|journal=Stem Cell Rev|volume=4|issue=|doi=10.1007/s12015-008-9026-0|pmid=18612851|via=|pages=235–54 | last1 = Talbot | first1 = NC | last2 = Le Ann | first2 = Blomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2016|title=Embryonic Stem Cells and Fetal Developmental Models|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-3483-6_5|journal=Fetal Stem Cells in Regenerative Medicine|volume=|issue=|doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-3483-6_5|pmid=|access-date=|via=|pages=81–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideal criteria for cell lines for the purpose of cultured meat production include: immortality, high proliferative ability, surface independence, serum independence, and tissue-forming ability. The specific cell types most suitable for cellular agriculture are likely to differ from species to species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2013|title=Isolation and culture of bovine embryonic stem cells|journal=Epiblast Stem Cells|volume=1074|issue=|doi=10.1007/978-1-62703-628-3_9|pmid=23975809|via=|pages=111–23 | last1 = Cao | first1 = S | last2 = Wang | first2 = F | last3 = Liu | first3 = L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012|title=Why is it so difficult to derive pluripotent stem cells in domestic ungulates?|pmid=22913556|journal=Reprod Domest Anim|volume=47 Suppl 5|issue=|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0531.2012.02106.x|via=|pages=11–7 | last1 = Gandolfi | first1 = F | last2 = Pennarossa | first2 = G | last3 = Maffei | first3 = S | last4 = Brevini | first4 = T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Growth media ===
Today the status quo for growing animal tissue in culture involves the use of fetal bovine serum (FBS). FBS is a blood product extracted from fetal calves. This product supplies cells with nutrients and stimulating growth factors, but is unsustainable and resource-heavy to produce, with large batch-to-batch variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van der Valk|first=J|date=2010|title=Optimization of chemically defined cell culture media--replacing fetal bovine serum in mammalian in vitro methods|journal=Toxicol In Vitro|volume=24|issue=|doi=10.1016/j.tiv.2010.03.016|pmid=20362047|via=|pages=1053–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the creation of the cell lines, efforts to remove serum from the growth media are key to the advancement of cellular agriculture as fetal bovine serum has been the target of most criticisms of cellular agriculture and cultured meat production. It is likely that two different media formulations will be required for each cell type: a proliferation media, for growth, and a differentiation media, for maturation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Agapakis|first=Christina|date=2012|title=Steak of the Art: The Fatal Flaws of In Vitro Meat|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2012/04/24/steak-of-the-art-the-fatal-flaws-of-in-vitro-meat/#.V6jP-Vcw3zI|journal=Discover Magazine|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scaling technologies ===
As biotechnological processes are scaled, experiments start to become increasingly expensive, as bioreactors of increasing volume will have to be created. Each increase in size will require a re-optimization of various parameters such as unit operations, fluid dynamics, mass transfer and reaction kinetics.

=== Scaffold materials ===
For cells to form tissue, it is helpful for a material scaffold to be added to provide structure. Scaffolds are crucial for cells to form tissues larger than 100&amp;nbsp;µm across. An ideal scaffold must be non-toxic for the cells, edible, and allow for the flow of nutrients and oxygen. It must also be cheap and easy to produce on a large scale without the need for animals.

=== 3D tissue systems ===
The final phase for creating cultured meat involves bringing together all the previous pieces of research to create large (&gt;100&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter) pieces of tissue that can be made of mass-produced cells without the need of serum, where the scaffold is suitable for cells and humans.

== Applications ==
Cellular agriculture is a scientific field that designs new mechanisms to produce existing agriculture products. While the majority of discussion has been around food applications, particular cultured meat, cellular agriculture can be used to create any kind of agricultural product, including those that never involved animals to begin with, like Gingko Biowork's fragrances.

Over the last several years, several cellular agriculture start-ups have been created applying cellular agriculture to make a number of agricultural products and consumables.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4851">The '''certificate of pharmaceutical product''' (abbreviated: '''CPP''') is a certificate issued in the format recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), which establishes the status of the pharmaceutical product and of the applicant for this certificate in the exporting country. It is issued for a single product, because manufacturing arrangements and approved information for different pharmaceutical forms and strengths can vary.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/regulation_legislation/certification/modelcertificate/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; Model certificate of a pharmaceutical product |publisher=Who.int |date=2009-03-13 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==

The Certificate of a Pharmaceutical Product is needed by the importing country when the product in question is intended for registration (licensing, authorisation) or renewal (prolongation) of registration, with the scope of commercialisation or distribution in that country.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;
Certification has been recommended by WHO to help undersized drug regulatory authorities or drug regulatory authorities without proper quality assurance facilities in importing countries to assess the quality of pharmaceutical products as prerequisite of registration or importation.

In the presence of such CPP, WHO recommends to national authorities to ensure that analytical methods can be confirmed by the national laboratory, to review and if necessary to adapt product information as per local labelling requirements, and to assess bioequivalence and stability data if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://apps.who.int/prequal/info_general/documents/WHO_DMP_RGS_98_5_R.pdf Marketing Authorization of Pharmaceutical Products with Special Reference to Multisource (Generic) Products: A Manual for Drug Regulatory Authorities]. - Regulatory Support Series No. 005, WHO/DMP/RGS/98.5, Geneva, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, regulatory practices often vary in importing countries. Thus, in addition to CPP, assessment of application dossiers to support drug registrations, with different levels and complexity of requirements are considered necessary to satisfy full assurance on the appropriate quality of drugs.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. Use of the WHO Certification Scheme on the Quality of Pharmaceutical Products Moving in International Commerce. WHO/DAP/94.21, Geneva, January 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and format==

The content of CPP consists of the following main data:

* Exporting (certifying) country
* Importing (requesting) country
* Name, dosage (pharmaceutical) form and composition of the product [active ingredient(s) and amount(s) per unit dose]
* Information on registration (licensing) and marketing (presence on the market) status of the product in the exporting country
* Number of product license (including license holder details, license holder’s involvement in manufacturing if any) and date of issue, if applicable
* Appended summary of technical basis on which the product has been licensed (if required by the issuing authority)
* Appended current product information
* Details on the applicant for the CPP
* If marketing authorisation is lacking in the exporting country, information about reasons
When applicable, information if the manufacturing site is periodically inspected by certifying authority and if the manufacturing site complies with [[Good Manufacturing Practice]] (GMP) as recommended by WHO.

Although issuing authorities claim that their CPP conform to WHO format (a statement to confirm whether or not the document is issued in the format recommended by WHO should be included in the certificate), their format and content may vary from an issuing country to another. Also, some authorities do not issue CPP if the respective drug is not licensed in the exporting country (e.g. Italy). In this last case, a Certificate of Exportation is issued instead, with a format and content similar to those of CPP.

==Special considerations in importing countries==

Most competent authorities in importing countries require CPP to be issued by the [[country of origin]].

Also, even though this certificate is released in its original form, addressed to a specific importing country and stamped with the seal of issuing authority on each page, many authorities in importing countries may unnecessarily request authentication of such a document in the form of [[Legalization (international law)|legalisation]] by their embassy in the exporting country or by [[apostille|apostillation]] ("Abuse of scheme").

'''Cherry picking''', '''suppressing evidence''', or the '''fallacy of incomplete evidence''' is the act of pointing to individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position while ignoring a significant portion of related cases or data that may contradict that position. It is a kind of fallacy of selective attention, the most common example of which is the [[confirmation bias]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/fallacy/#SuppressedEvidence The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "Fallacies", Bradley Dowden (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/66-cherry-picking Cherry Picking]&lt;/ref&gt; Cherry picking may be committed intentionally or unintentionally. This fallacy is a major problem in public debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Klass|first= Gary|title= Just Plain Data Analysis: Common Statistical Fallacies in Analyses of Social Indicator Data.

The term is based on the perceived process of harvesting fruit, such as [[cherry|cherries]].  The picker would be expected to only select the ripest and healthiest fruits. An observer who only sees the selected fruit may thus wrongly conclude that most, or even all, of the tree's fruit is in a likewise good condition. This can also give a false impression of the quality of the fruit (since it is only a sample and is not a [[representative sample]]).

Cherry picking has a negative connotation as the practice neglects, overlooks or directly suppresses evidence that could lead to a complete picture.

A concept sometimes confused with cherry picking is the idea of gathering only the fruit that is easy to harvest, while ignoring other fruit that is higher up on the tree and thus more difficult to obtain (see [[low-hanging fruit]]).

Cherry picking can be found in many [[fallacy|logical fallacies]]. For example, the "fallacy of [[anecdotal evidence]]" tends to overlook large amounts of data in favor of that known personally, "selective use of evidence" rejects material unfavorable to an argument, while a [[false dichotomy]] picks only two options when more are available. Cherry picking can refer to the selection of data or data sets so a study or survey will give desired, predictable results which may be misleading or even completely contrary to reality.&lt;ref name="Goldacre2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldacre|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben Goldacre|title=Bad Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gv1NQubrGNIC|year=2008|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=978-0-00-728319-4|pages=97–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In science==
[[File:Temperaturanstieg-vergleich-zwischen-ausschnitt-und-gesamtverlauf.gif|thumb|320px|Cherry-picking is often used in [[denialism|science denial]] such as [[climate change denial]]. For example with deliberately cherry picking appropriate time periods, here 1998-2012, an artificial "pause" can be created, even when there is an ongoing warming trend.&lt;ref name="Hansson"&gt;[[Sven Ove Hansson]]: ''Science denial as a form of pseudoscience''. [[Studies in History and Philosophy of Science]]. 63, 2017, pp 39–47, {{DOI|10.1016/j.shpsa.2017.05.002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Cherry picking is one of the epistemological characteristics of [[denialism]] and widely used by different science [[Denialism|denialists]] to seemingly contradict scientific findings. For example, it is used in [[climate change denial]], denial of the negative health effects of the consumption [[tobacco products]] and passive smoking and [[evolution denial]] by creationists.&lt;ref name="Hansson" /&gt;

==In medicine==
In a 2002 study, a review of previous medical data found cherry picking in tests of anti-depression medication:

:"[researchers] reviewed 31 antidepressant efficacy trials to identify the primary exclusion criteria used in determining eligibility for participation. Their findings suggest that patients in current antidepressant trials represent only a minority of patients treated in routine clinical practice for depression. Excluding potential clinical trial subjects with certain profiles means that the ability to generalize the results of antidepressant efficacy trials lacks empirical support, according to the authors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url= |title= Typical Depression Patients Excluded from Drug Trials; exclusion criteria: is it "cherry picking"? |journal= The Brown University Psychopharmacology Update |publisher= Wiley Periodicals |volume= 13 |issue= 5 |date= May 2002 |pages= 1–3|issn=1068-5308}} Based on the studies: {{cite journal|last1=Posternak|first1=MA|last2=Zimmerman|first2=M|last3=Keitner|first3=GI|last4=Miller|first4=IW|title=A reevaluation of the exclusion criteria used in antidepressant efficacy trials|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|date=February 2002|volume=159|issue=2|pages=191–200|pmid=11823258|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.159.2.191}}, {{cite journal|last1=Zimmerman|first1=M|last2=Mattia|first2=JI|last3=Posternak|first3=MA|title=Are subjects in pharmacological treatment trials of depression representative of patients in routine clinical practice?|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|date=March 2002|volume=159|issue=3|pages=469–73|pmid=11870014|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.159.3.469}}

==In argumentation==
In argumentation, the practice of "[[quote mining]]" is a form of cherry picking,&lt;ref name="scienceornot" /&gt; in which the debater selectively picks some quotes supporting a position (or exaggerating an opposing position) while ignoring those that moderate the original quote or put it into a different context. Cherry picking in debates is a large problem as the facts themselves are true but need to be put in context. Because research cannot be done live and is often untimely, cherry-picked facts or quotes usually stick in the public mainstream and, even when corrected, lead to widespread misrepresentation of groups targeted.

==One-sided argument&lt;!--'One-sided argument' redirects here--&gt;==
A '''one-sided argument''' (also known as '''card stacking''', '''stacking the deck''', '''ignoring the counterevidence''', '''slanting''', and '''suppressed evidence''')&lt;ref name=stacking&gt;{{cite web|title=One-Sidedness - The Fallacy Files|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/onesided.html|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[informal fallacy]] that occurs when only the reasons supporting a proposition are supplied, while all reasons opposing it are omitted.

Philosophy professor [[Peter Suber]] has written: "The one-sidedness fallacy does not make an argument invalid. It may not even make the argument unsound. The fallacy consists in persuading readers, and perhaps ourselves, that we have said enough to tilt the scale of evidence and therefore enough to justify a judgment. If we have been one-sided, though, then we haven't yet said enough to justify a judgment. The arguments on the other side may be stronger than our own. We won't know until we examine them.  So the one-sidedness fallacy doesn't mean that your premises are false or irrelevant, only that they are incomplete."&lt;ref name="Suber"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/courses/inflogic/onesided.htm |title=The One-Sidedness Fallacy |author=Peter Suber |accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"With rational messages, you need to decide if you want to use a one-sided argument or a two-sided argument. A one-sided argument only presents the pro side of the argument, while a two-sided argument presents both sides. Which one you use will depend on which one meets your needs and the type of audience. Generally, one-sided arguments are better with audiences already favorable to your message. Two-sided arguments are best with audiences who are opposed to your argument, are better educated or have already been exposed to counter arguments."&lt;ref name="Suber"/&gt;

'''Card stacking''' is a [[propaganda]] technique that seeks to manipulate audience perception of an issue by emphasizing one side and repressing another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The fine art of propaganda: a study of Father Coughlin's s=Institute for Propaganda Analysis |first= |authorlink= |year=1939 |publisher=Harcourt Brace and Company |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=95–101 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EzVMAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22card+stacking%22&amp;dq=%22card+stacking%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=61PtTK63KYOglAe5hpmcAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such emphasis may be achieved through [[media bias]] or the use of [[One-sided argument|one-sided]] testimonials, or by simply [[Censorship|censoring]] the voices of critics. The technique is commonly used in persuasive speeches by political candidates to discredit their opponents and to make themselves seem more worthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The art of creative critical thinking |last=C. S. Kim |first=John |authorlink= |year=1993 |publisher=University Press of America |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=317–318 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5PXWAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22card+stacking%22&amp;dq=%22card+stacking%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=61PtTK63KYOglAe5hpmcAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originates from the [[Magic (illusion)|magician]]'s gimmick of "[[Glossary of poker terms#cold deck|stacking the deck]]", which involves presenting a [[Playing card|deck of cards]] that appears to have been randomly shuffled but which is, in fact, 'stacked' in a specific order. The magician knows the order and is able to control the outcome of the trick. In poker, cards can be stacked so that certain hands are dealt to certain players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Clear thinking: a practical introduction |last=Ruchlis |first=Hyman |authorlink= |author2=Sandra Oddo |year=1990 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=195–196 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04JqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22card+stacking%22&amp;dq=%22card+stacking%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=61PtTK63KYOglAe5hpmcAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon can be applied to any subject and has wide applications. Whenever a broad spectrum of information exists, appearances can be rigged by highlighting some facts and ignoring others. Card stacking can be a tool of advocacy groups or of those groups with specific agendas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Immunization: the reality behind the myth, Volume 3 |last=James |first=Walene |authorlink= |year=1995 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=193–194 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EQHPoGs6CvIC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=%22card+stacking%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=61PtTK63KYOglAe5hpmcAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22card%20stacking%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an enlistment poster might focus upon an impressive picture, with words such as "travel" and "adventure", while placing the words, "enlist for two to four years" at the bottom in a smaller and less noticeable point size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Techniques of Propaganda and Persuasion |last=Shabo |first=Magedah |authorlink= |year=2008 |publisher=Prestwick House Inc |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=24–29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sDIbJUAZeuwC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=%22card+stacking%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=61PtTK63KYOglAe5hpmcAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22card%20stacking%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States spends much more money on healthcare than Canada, on both a per-capita basis and as a percentage of GDP.&lt;ref name="OECD Canada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/33/38979719.pdf |title=OECD Health Data 2008: How Does Canada Compare |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628131552/http://www.oecd.org/health/health-systems/BriefingNoteCANADA2012.pdf|archivedate=June 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, per-capita spending for health care in Canada was US$3,678; in the U.S., US$6,714. The U.S. spent 15.3% of GDP on healthcare in that year; Canada spent 10.0%.&lt;ref name="OECD Canada"/&gt; In 2006, 70% of healthcare spending in Canada was financed by government, versus 46% in the United States. Total government spending per capita in the U.S. on healthcare was 23% higher than Canadian government spending, and U.S. government expenditure on healthcare was just under 83% of total Canadian spending (public and private) though these statistics don't take into account population differences.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/whosis/database/core/core_select_process.cfm?strISO3_select=ALL&amp;strIndicator_select=nha&amp;intYear_select=latest&amp;fixed=country&amp;language=english Core Health Indicators]. U.S. government spending was US$2724 vs. US$2214 on a [[purchasing power parity]] basis ($2724 and $2121 on a non-adjusted basis); total U.S. spending was US$6096 vs. US$3137 (PPP) ($6096 and $3038 on a non-adjusted basis).&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have come to different conclusions about the result of this disparity in spending. A 2007 review of all studies comparing health outcomes in Canada and the US in a Canadian peer-reviewed medical journal found that "health outcomes may be superior in patients cared for in Canada versus the United States, but differences are not consistent."&lt;ref name="Open Medicine"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Guyatt G.H. | year = 2007 | title = A systematic review of studies comparing health outcomes in Canada and the United States | url = http://www.openmedicine.ca/article/view/8/1 | journal = Open Medicine | volume = 1 | page = 1 | display-authors = etal | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070705032644/http://www.openmedicine.ca/article/view/8/1 | archivedate = July 5, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the noted differences were a higher life expectancy in Canada, as well as a lower infant mortality rate than the United States.

One commonly cited comparison, the 2000 World Health Organization's ratings of "overall health service performance", which used a "composite measure of achievement in the level of health, the distribution of health, the level of responsiveness and fairness of financial contribution", ranked Canada 30th and the US 37th among 191 member nations.  This study rated the US "responsiveness", or quality of service for individuals receiving treatment, as 1st, compared with 7th for Canada.  However, the average life expectancy for Canadians was 80.34 years compared with 78.6 years for residents of the US.&lt;ref name="WHO 2000"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/annex01_en.pdf |title=Health system attainment and performance in all Member States, ranked by eight measures, estimates for 1997 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO's study methods were criticized by some analyses.
While life-expectancy and infant mortality are commonly used in comparing nationwide health care, they are in fact affected by many factors other than the quality of a nation's health care system, including individual behavior and population makeup.&lt;ref name="NBER 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |first=June E. |last=O'Neill |first2=Dave M. |last2=O'Neill |title=Health Status, Health Care and Inequality: Canada vs. the U.S. |journal=Forum for Health Economics &amp; Policy |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages= |doi=10.2202/1558-9544.1094 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 report by the [[Congressional Research Service]] carefully summarizes some recent data and noted the "difficult research issues" facing international comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Research Service, [http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL34175_20070917.pdf "U.S. Health Care Spending: Comparison with Other OECD Countries"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126203047/http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL34175_20070917.pdf |date=January 26, 2011 }}, September 17, 2007.

==Government involvement==
In 2004, government funding of healthcare in Canada was equivalent to $1,893 per person.  In the US, government spending per person was $2,728.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL34175_20070917.pdf |title=Comparison with Other OECD Countries |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126203047/http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL34175_20070917.pdf |archivedate=January 26, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian healthcare system is composed of at least 10 mostly autonomous provincial healthcare systems that report to their provincial governments, and a federal system which covers the military and [[First Nations]]. This causes a significant degree of variation in funding and coverage within the country.

===History===
Canada and the US had similar healthcare systems in the early 1960s,&lt;ref name="Szick"/&gt; but now have a different mix of funding mechanisms. Canada's universal [[single-payer healthcare]] system covers about 70% of expenditures, and the [[Canada Health Act]] requires that all insured persons be fully insured, without co-payments or user fees, for all medically necessary hospital and physician care.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}  About 91% of hospital expenditures and 99% of total physician services are financed by the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/944-e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, with its mixed public-private system, 16% or 45 million American residents are uninsured at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nchc.org/facts/coverage.shtml The National Coalition on Health Care, Facts About Healthcare – Health Insurance Coverage.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822142929/http://www.nchc.org/facts/coverage.shtml |date=August 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. is one of two [[OECD]] countries not to have some form of universal health coverage, the other being Turkey. Mexico established a universal healthcare program by November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecdwash.org/PDFILES/health2003_wash.pdf |title=Reforming Health Systems in OECD Countries |accessdate=2007-07-11 |last=Docteur |first=Elizabeth |date=2003-06-23 |format=PDF |work=Presentation, OECD Breakfast Series in Partnership with NABE. |publisher=OECD |page=20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929011836/http://www.oecdwash.org/PDFILES/health2003_wash.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health insurance===
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
The governments of both nations are closely involved in healthcare. The central structural difference between the two is in [[health insurance]]. In Canada, the federal government is committed to providing funding support to its provincial governments for healthcare expenditures as long as the province in question abides by accessibility guarantees as set out in the [[Canada Health Act]], which explicitly prohibits billing end users for procedures that are covered by [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} While some label Canada's system as "socialized medicine", health economists do not use that term.  Unlike systems with public delivery, such as the UK, the Canadian system provides public coverage for a combination of public and private delivery. Princeton University health economist Uwe E. Reinhardt says that single-payer systems are not "socialized medicine" but "social insurance" systems, since providers (such as doctors) are largely in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhardt, U.E. ''et al.'' [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118411829790962883 Letters: For Children's Sake, This 'Schip' Needs to Be Relaunched.] ''Wall Street Journal'', July 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, Canadian hospitals are controlled by private boards or regional health authorities, rather than being part of government.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the US, direct government funding of health care is limited to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], [[Medicaid]], and the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP), which cover eligible senior citizens, the very poor, disabled persons, and children. The federal government also runs the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]], which provides care directly to retired or disabled veterans, their families, and survivors through medical centers and clinics.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The U.S. government also runs the [[Military Health System]]. In fiscal year 2007, the MHS had a total budget of $39.4 billion and served approximately 9.1 million beneficiaries, including active-duty personnel and their families, and retirees and their families. The MHS includes 133,000 personnel, 86,000 military and 47,000 civilian, working at more than 1,000 locations worldwide, including 70 inpatient facilities and 1,085 medical, dental, and veterans' clinics.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

One study estimates that about 25 percent of the uninsured in the U.S. are eligible for these programs but remain unenrolled; however, extending coverage to all who are eligible remains a fiscal and political challenge.&lt;ref name="Kaiser Uninsured"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kff.org/uninsured/upload/7613.pdf |title=Characteristics of the Uninsured: Who is Eligible for Public Coverage and Who Needs Help Affording Coverage?  |accessdate=2007-07-19 |format=PDF |work=Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For everyone else, health insurance must be paid for privately. Some 59% of U.S. residents have access to health care insurance through employers, although this figure is decreasing, and coverages as well as workers' expected contributions vary widely.&lt;ref name="Census 2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2008pubs/p60-235.pdf| title=Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2007 |accessdate=2008-08-26 | format=PDF |work=U.S. Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those whose employers do not offer health insurance, as well as those who are self-employed or unemployed, must purchase it on their own. Nearly 27 million of the 45 million uninsured U.S. residents worked at least part-time in 2007, and more than a third were in households that earned $50,000 or more per year.&lt;ref name="Census 2007" /&gt;

===Funding===
Despite the greater role of private business in the US, federal and state agencies are increasingly involved, paying about 45% of the $2.2 trillion the nation spent on medical care in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Julie |last=Appleby |title=Universal care appeals to USA |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/2006-10-15-universal-usat_x.htm |work=USA Today |date=2006-10-16 |accessdate=2007-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government spends more on healthcare than on Social Security and national defense combined, according to the [[Brookings Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opportunity08.org/Files/FD.ashx?guid=98a417e5-5972-4031-b361-e11e00981f55 |title=Meeting the Dilemma of Health Care Access |accessdate=2007-06-21 |format=PDF |work=Opportunity 08: A Project of the Brookings Institution |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211359/http://www.opportunity08.org/Files/FD.ashx?guid=98a417e5-5972-4031-b361-e11e00981f55 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond its direct spending, the US government is also highly involved in healthcare through regulation and legislation. For example, the [[Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973]] provided grants and loans to subsidize [[Health Maintenance Organizations]] and contained provisions to stimulate their popularity. HMOs had been declining before the law; by 2002 there were 500 such plans enrolling 76 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/6225.php |title=Health Care Expenditures in the USA |accessdate=2007-07-18 |work=National Center for Health Statistics | publisher=Medical News Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian system has been 69–75% [[publicly funded healthcare|publicly funded]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/36/38979632.xls |title=OECD Health Data 2007 – Frequently Requested Data |accessdate=2007-08-27 |format=Excel |work=OECD }}&lt;/ref&gt; though most services are delivered by private providers, including physicians (although they may derive their revenue primarily from government billings). Although some doctors work on a purely fee-for-service basis (usually family physicians), some family physicians and most specialists are paid through a combination of fee-for-service and fixed contracts with hospitals or health service management organizations.

Canada's universal health plans do not cover certain services.  Non-cosmetic [[Dentistry|dental care]] is covered for children up to age 14 in some provinces.  Outpatient prescription drugs are not required to be covered, but some provinces have drug cost programs that cover most drug costs for certain populations.  In every province, seniors receiving the [[Guaranteed Income Supplement]] have significant additional coverage; some provinces expand forms of drug coverage to all seniors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coverme.com/LH/CoverMe/miniWhy/English/NotCovered/A_NS.html |title=CoverMe Government Health Insurance Coverage |publisher=Coverme.com |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; low-income families,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coverme.com/LH/CoverMe/miniWhy/English/NotCovered/A_SK.html |title=CoverMe Government Health Insurance Coverage |publisher=Coverme.com |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; those on social assistance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coverme.com/LH/CoverMe/miniWhy/English/NotCovered/A_NF.html |title=CoverMe Government Health Insurance Coverage |publisher=Coverme.com |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; or those with certain medical conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnb.ca/0212/intro-e.asp |title=Health – Prescription Drug Program |publisher=Gnb.ca |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some provinces cover all drug prescriptions over a certain portion of a family's income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/pharmacare/index.html |title=Manitoba Pharmacare Program Information: 2007–2008 |accessdate=2007-08-27 |work=Province of Manitoba }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drug prices are also regulated, so brand-name prescription drugs are often significantly cheaper than in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aarp.org/bulletin/prescription/Articles/a2003-08-12-whydrugs.html |title=Why Drugs Cost Less Up North: Important Differences in American, Canadian Systems Produce Big Price Disparities |date=June 2003 | accessdate=2007-07-02 |work=AARP Bulletin }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Optometry]] is only covered in some provinces and is sometimes only covered for children under a certain age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/health/mhsip/index.html#insuredmedicalbenefits |title=Manitoba Health Benefits |publisher=Gov.mb.ca |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visits to non-physician specialists may require an additional fee. Also, some procedures are only covered under certain circumstances. For example, [[circumcision]] is not covered, and a fee is usually charged when a parent requests the procedure; however, if an infection or [[medical necessity]] arises, the procedure would be covered.

According to Dr. Albert Schumacher, former president of the Canadian Medical Association, an estimated 75 percent of Canadian healthcare services are delivered privately, but funded publicly.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Frontline practitioners whether they're GPs or specialists by and large are not salaried. They're small hardware stores. Same thing with labs and radiology clinics ... The situation we are seeing now are more services around not being funded publicly but people having to pay for them, or their insurance companies. We have sort of a passive privatization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/healthcare/public_vs_private.html Public vs. private health care.] ''CBC'', December 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Coverage and access==
In both Canada and the United States, access can be a problem. Studies suggest that 40% of U.S. citizens do not have adequate health insurance, if any at all. In Canada, 5% of Canadian citizens have not been able to find a regular doctor, with a further 9% having never looked for one.  Yet, even if some cannot find a family doctor, every Canadian citizen is covered by the national health care system.  The U.S. data is evidenced in a 2007 Consumer Reports study on the U.S. health care system which showed that the underinsured account for 24% of the U.S. population and live with skeletal health insurance that barely covers their medical needs and leaves them unprepared to pay for major medical expenses.  When added to the population of uninsured (approximately 16% of the U.S. population), a total of 40% of Americans ages 18–64 have inadequate access to healthcare, according to the Consumer Reports study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/08/cu_insurance.html Consumer Reports Study on the Uninsured], 08-07-06&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian data comes from the 2003 Canadian Community Health Survey,&lt;ref name="Statcan"&gt;[http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/040615/d040615b.htm Canadian Community Health Survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231215220/http://www.statcan.ca/Daily/English/040615/d040615b.htm |date=December 31, 2006 }}, 04-06-15&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the federal government does not guarantee [[universal healthcare]] to all its citizens, but [[publicly funded healthcare]] programs help to provide for the elderly, disabled, the poor, and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov |title=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services |accessdate=2007-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act]] or EMTALA also ensures public access to [[emergency services]]. The EMTALA law forces emergency healthcare providers to stabilize an emergency health crisis and cannot withhold treatment for lack of evidence of insurance coverage or other evidence of the ability to pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/EMTALA/ |title=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services: Emergency Medical Treatment &amp; Labor Act |publisher=Cms.hhs.gov |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMTALA does not absolve the person receiving emergency care of the obligation to meet the cost of emergency healthcare not paid for at the time and it is still within the right of the hospital to pursue any debtor for the cost of emergency care provided. In Canada, emergency room treatment for legal Canadian residents is not charged to the patient at time of service but is met by the government.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], 59.3% of U.S. citizens have [[health insurance]] related to employment, 27.8% have government-provided health-insurance; nearly 9% purchase health insurance directly (there is some overlap in these figures), and 15.3% (45.7 million) were uninsured in 2007.&lt;ref name="Census 2007"/&gt; An estimated 25 percent of the uninsured are eligible for government programs but unenrolled.&lt;ref name="Kaiser Uninsured" /&gt; About a third of the uninsured are in households earning more than $50,000 annually.&lt;ref name="Census 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seymour, J.A.

A number of [[free clinic|clinics]] provide free or low-cost non-emergency care to poor, uninsured patients. The National Association of Free Clinics claims that its member clinics provide $3 billion in services to some 3.5 million patients annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freeclinics.us/AboutUs/tabid/54/Default.aspx |title=National Association of Free Clinics: About Us |accessdate=2007-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A peer-reviewed comparison study of healthcare access in the two countries published in 2006 concluded that U.S. residents are one third less likely to have a regular medical doctor, one fourth more likely to have unmet healthcare needs, and are more than twice as likely to forgo needed medicines.&lt;ref name="Lasser et al." /&gt; The study noted that access problems "were particularly dire for the US uninsured." Those who lack insurance in the U.S. were much less satisfied, less likely to have seen a doctor, and more likely to have been unable to receive desired care than both Canadians and insured Americans.&lt;ref name="Lasser et al." /&gt;

Another cross-country study compared access to care based on immigrant status in Canada and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Lebrun LA &amp; Dubay LC. (2010). Access to primary and preventive care among foreign-born adults in Canada and the United States.

Specifically, immigrants living in Canada were less likely to have timely Pap tests compared with native-born Canadians; in addition, immigrants in the U.S. were less likely to have a regular medical doctor and an annual consultation with a health care provider compared with native-born Americans. In general, immigrants in Canada had better access to care than those in the U.S., but most of the differences were explained by differences in socioeconomic status (income, education) and insurance coverage across the two countries. However, immigrants in the U.S. were more likely to have timely Pap tests than immigrants in Canada.

[[Cato Institute]] has expressed concerns that the U.S. government has restricted the freedom of Medicare patients to spend their own money on healthcare, and has contrasted these developments with the situation in Canada, where in 2005 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the province of Quebec could not prohibit its citizens from purchasing covered services through private health insurance. The institute has urged the Congress to restore the right of American seniors to spend their own money on medical care.&lt;ref&gt;Kent Masterson Brown, [http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8737 "The Freedom to Spend Your Own Money on Medical Care: A Common Casualty of Universal Coverage"], CATO Institute Policy Analysis no. 601, October 15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Under that law, if a health care plan offers mental health and/or substance use disorder benefits, it must offer the benefits on par with the other medical/surgical benefits it covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parity Implementation Coalition|url=http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/sites/default/files/final%20detailed%20summary.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wait times==
One complaint about both the U.S. and Canadian systems is waiting times, whether for a specialist, major elective surgery, such as [[hip replacement]], or specialized treatments, such as [[Radiation therapy|radiation]] for [[breast cancer]]; wait times in each country are affected by various factors. In the United States, access is primarily determined by whether a person has access to funding to pay for treatment and by the availability of services in the area and by the willingness of the provider to deliver service at the price set by the insurer. In Canada, the wait time is set according to the availability of services in the area and by the relative need of the person needing treatment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

As reported by the [[Health Council of Canada]], a 2010 Commonwealth survey found that 39% of Canadians waited 2 hours or more in the emergency room, versus 31% in the U.S.; 43% waited 4 weeks or more to see a specialist, versus 10% in the U.S. The same survey states that 37% of Canadians say it is difficult to access care after hours (evenings, weekends or holidays) without going to the emergency department over 34% of Americans.  Furthermore, 47% of Canadians and 50% of Americans who visited emergency departments over the past two years feel that they could have been treated at their normal place of care if they were able to get an appointment.&lt;ref name=HCC_CommWealth2010&gt;{{cite web|title=How Do Canadians Rate the Health Care System?|url=http://healthcouncilcanada.ca/en/index.php?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=shop.flypage&amp;product_id=120&amp;category_id=20&amp;manufacturer_id=0&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=170|publisher=Health Council of Canada|accessdate=August 9, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827054733/http://healthcouncilcanada.ca/en/index.php?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=shop.flypage&amp;product_id=120&amp;category_id=20&amp;manufacturer_id=0&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=170|archivedate=August 27, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 survey of hospital administrators conducted in Canada, the U.S., and three other countries found dissatisfaction with both the U.S. and Canadian systems.  For example, 21% of Canadian hospital administrators, but less than 1% of American administrators, said that it would take over three weeks to do a biopsy for possible breast cancer on a 50-year-old woman; 50% of Canadian administrators versus none of their American counterparts said that it would take over six months for a 65-year-old to undergo a routine hip replacement surgery.

In a letter to the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', Robert Bell, the President and CEO of University Health Network, Toronto, said that [[Michael Moore]]'s film ''[[Sicko]]'' "exaggerated the performance of the Canadian health system&amp;nbsp;— there is no doubt that too many patients still stay in our emergency departments waiting for admission to scarce hospital beds." However, "Canadians spend about 55% of what Americans spend on health care and have longer life expectancy and lower infant mortality rates. Many Americans have access to quality healthcare. All Canadians have access to similar care at a considerably lower cost." There is "no question" that the lower cost has come at the cost of "restriction of supply with sub-optimal access to services," said Bell. A new approach is targeting waiting times, which are reported on public websites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health.gov.on.ca/transformation/wait_times/wait_mn.html Ontario Wait Times.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703172616/http://www.health.gov.on.ca/transformation/wait_times/wait_mn.html |date=July 3, 2007 }} From: health.gov.on.ca.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancercare.on.ca |title=Cancer Care Ontario |publisher=Cancercare.on.ca |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118394504633260585 "Canadian and U.S. Health Services – Let's Compare the Two,"] Letters, Wall Street Journal, July 9, 2007; Page A13&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmes had characterized her condition as an emergency, said she was losing her sight and portrayed her condition as a life-threatening brain cancer.
In July 2009 Holmes agreed to appear in television ads broadcast in the United States warning Americans of the dangers of adopting a Canadian-style health care system.
The ads she appeared in triggered debates on both sides of the border.
After her ad appeared critics pointed out discrepancies in her story, including that [[Rathke's cleft cyst]], the condition she was treated for, was not a form of cancer, and was not life-threatening.&lt;ref name=CbcShonaExaggeration&gt;

==Price of health care and administration overheads==
Healthcare is one of the most expensive items of both nations' budgets. In the United States, the various levels of government spend more per capita  than levels of government do in Canada. In 2004, Canada government-spending was $2,120 (in US dollars) per person, while the United States government-spending $2,724.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/whosis/database/core/core_select_process.cfm?countries=all&amp;indicators=nha |title=World Health Organization: Core Health Indicators |accessdate=2007-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1999 report found that after exclusions, administration accounted for 31.0% of healthcare expenditures in the United States, as compared with 16.7% in Canada.  In looking at the insurance element, in Canada, the provincial single-payer insurance system operated with overheads of 1.3%, comparing favourably with private insurance overheads (13.2%), U.S. private insurance overheads (11.7%) and U.S. Medicare and Medicaid program overheads (3.6% and 6.8% respectively). The report concluded by observing that gap between U.S. and Canadian spending on administration had grown to $752 per capita and that a large sum might be saved in the United States if the U.S. implemented a Canadian-style system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnhp.org/publications/nejmadmin.pdf |title="Costs of Health Care Administration in the United States and Canada" (2003) Steffie Woolhandler, Terry Campbell, David U. Himmelstein, '&amp;#39;The New England Journal of Medicine'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, U.S. government spending covers less than half of all healthcare costs. Private spending is also far greater in the U.S. than in Canada. In Canada, an average of $917 was spent annually by individuals or private insurance companies for health care, including dental, eye care, and drugs. In the U.S., this sum is $3,372.&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt; In 2006, healthcare consumed 15.3% of U.S. annual GDP. In Canada, only 10% of GDP was spent on healthcare.&lt;ref name="OECD Canada"/&gt; This difference is a relatively recent development. In 1971 the nations were much closer, with Canada spending 7.1% of GDP while the U.S. spent 7.6%.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Some who advocate against greater government involvement in healthcare have asserted that the difference in costs between the two nations is partially explained by the differences in their demographics.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon L.

===Medical professionals===
Some of the extra money spent in the United States goes to [[physicians]], nurses, and other medical professionals. According to health data collected by the [[OECD]], average income for physicians in the United States in 1996 was nearly twice that for physicians in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econedlink.org/lessons/docs_lessons/535_DaigneaultLajoie1.pdf Health Care Systems: An International Comparison.] Strategic Policy and Research Intergovernmental Affairs, May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the [[Gross (economics)|gross]] average salary for doctors in Canada was CDN[[Canadian dollar|$]]328,000. Out of the gross amount, doctors pay for taxes, rent, staff salaries and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/canadian-doctor-total-at-record-high-1.1869346|title=
Canadian doctor total at record high
|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; When comparing average incomes of doctors in Canada and U.S., it should be kept in mind that malpractice insurance premiums may differ significantly between Canada and the U.S., and the proportion of doctors who are specialists differs. In Canada, less than half of doctors are specialists whereas more than 70% of doctors are specialists in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conover|first1=Chris|title=Are U.S. Doctors Paid Too Much?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2013/05/28/are-u-s-doctors-paid-too-much/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=31 January 2015|date=2013-05-28|quote=Consequently, comparing average doctor pay in the U.S. (where more than 70% of doctors are specialists) to that in nations such as Canada and France (where less than half of doctors are specialists) is not very illuminating.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada has fewer doctors per capita than the United States. In the U.S, there were 2.4 doctors per 1,000 people in 2005; in Canada, there were 2.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/document/16/0,3343,en_2825_495642_2085200_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=OECD Health Data 2007: Frequently Requested Data |accessdate=2007-07-19 |format=Excel spreadsheet |work=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some doctors leave Canada to pursue career goals or higher pay in the U.S., though significant numbers of physicians from countries such as China, India, Pakistan and South Africa immigrate to practice in Canada.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Many Canadian physicians and new medical graduates also go to the U.S. for post-graduate training in medical residencies. As it is a much larger market, new and cutting-edge sub-specialties are more widely available in the U.S. as opposed to Canada. However, statistics published in 2005 by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), show that, for the first time since 1969 (the period for which data are available), more physicians returned to Canada than moved abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=PG_587_E&amp;cw_topic=587&amp;cw_rel=AR_14_E |title=Supply, Distribution and Migration of Canadian Physicians, 2005 |accessdate=2007-07-11 |date=2006-10-12 |format=PDF |publisher=Canadian Institute for Health Information |page=40, fig. 10 |quote= ... in the past two years, the number of physicians returning from abroad has exceeded the number of physicians moving abroad. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713170030/http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=PG_587_E&amp;cw_topic=587&amp;cw_rel=AR_14_E |archivedate=July 13, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drugs===
Both Canada and the United States have limited programs to provide prescription drugs to the needy. In the U.S., the introduction of [[Medicare Part D]] has extended partial coverage for pharmaceuticals to Medicare beneficiaries. In Canada all drugs given in hospitals fall under Medicare, but other prescriptions do not. The provinces all have some programs to help the poor and seniors have access to drugs, but while there have been calls to create one, no national program exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/07/30/pharma_040730.html |title=Premiers propose drug plan paid for by Ottawa |publisher=CBC |date=2004-08-03 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; About two thirds of Canadians have private prescription drug coverage, mostly through their employers.&lt;ref name="OECD Pharmaceuticals"&gt;Valérie Paris and Elizabeth Docteur. [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/21/40/37868186.pdf Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement Policies in Canada] OECD Health Working Papers&lt;/ref&gt; In both countries, there is a significant population not fully covered by these programs. A 2005 study found that 20% of Canada's and 40% of America's sicker adults did not fill a prescription because of cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schoen C, Osborn R, Huynh PT |title=Taking the pulse of health care systems: experiences of patients with health problems in six countries |journal=Health Affairs (Project Hope) |volume=Suppl Web Exclusives |pages=W5–509–25 |year=2005  |pmid=16269444 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.w5.509 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the 2010 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey indicates that 4% of Canadians indicated that they did not visit a doctor because of cost compared with 22% of Americans.  Additionally, 21% of Americans have said that they did not fill a prescription for medicine or have skipped doses due to cost.  That is compared with 10% of Canadians.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

One of the most important differences between the two countries is the much higher cost of drugs in the United States. In the U.S., $728 per capita is spent each year on drugs, while in Canada it is $509.&lt;ref name="OECD Pharmaceuticals"/&gt; At the same time, consumption is higher in Canada, with about 12 prescriptions being filled per person each year in Canada and 10.6 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Valérie Paris and Elizabeth Docteur.

There are several reasons for the disparity. The Canadian system takes advantage of centralized buying by the provincial governments that have more market heft and buy in bulk, lowering prices. By contrast, the U.S. has explicit laws that prohibit [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] or [[Medicaid]] from negotiating drug prices. In addition, price negotiations by Canadian health insurers are based on evaluations of the clinical effectiveness of prescription drugs,&lt;ref name="AARP"&gt;Gross, David.

Retrieved on February 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the relative prices of therapeutically similar drugs to be considered in context. The Canadian Patented Medicine Prices Review Board also has the authority to set a fair and reasonable price on patented products, either comparing it to similar drugs already on the market, or by taking the average price in seven developed nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmprb-cepmb.gc.ca/english/view.asp?x=654&amp;mid=589 |title=Compendium of Guidelines, Policies and Procedures.

===Technology===
The United States spends more on technology than Canada. In a 2004 study on medical imaging in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=media_13jan2005_e "CIHI report shows increase in MRI and CT scanners, up more than 75% in the last decade."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925190007/http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=media_13jan2005_e |date=September 25, 2009 }} ''Medical Imaging in Canada, 2004.''&lt;/ref&gt; it was found that Canada had 4.6 [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scanners per million population while the U.S. had 19.5 per million.  Canada's 10.3 [[computerized tomography|CT scanners]] per million also ranked behind the U.S., which had 29.5 per million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=media_13jan2005_e |title=Press release: CIHI Report shows increase in MRI and CT scanners, up more than 75% in the last decade |publisher=Secure.cihi.ca |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925190007/http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=media_13jan2005_e |archivedate=September 25, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study did not attempt to assess whether the difference in the number of MRI and CT scanners had any effect on the medical outcomes or were a result of overcapacity but did observe that MRI scanners are used more intensively in Canada than either the U.S. or Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=PG_328_E&amp;cw_topic=328&amp;cw_rel=AR_1043_E#full Medical Imaging in Canada, 2004] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516185154/http://secure.cihi.ca/cihiweb/dispPage.jsp?cw_page=PG_328_E&amp;cw_topic=328&amp;cw_rel=AR_1043_E#full |date=May 16, 2007 }}. {{ISBN|1-55392-515-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This disparity in the availability of technology, some believe, results in longer wait times. In 1984 wait times of up to 22 months for an [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging|MRI]] were alleged in Saskatchewan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/170/5/776-a |title=Saskatchewan's 22-month wait for an MRI is "almost criminal" says radiologists' association – Ehman 170 (5): 776 – Canadian Medical Association Journal |doi=10.1503/cmaj.1040237 |publisher=Cmaj.ca |date=2004-03-02 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to more recent official statistics (2007), all emergency patients receive MRIs within 24 hours, those classified as urgent receive them in under 3 weeks and the maximum elective wait time is 19 weeks in Regina and 26 weeks in Saskatoon, the province's two largest metropolitan areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.sk.ca/adx/aspx/adxGetMedia.aspx?mediaId=185&amp;PN=Shared&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Health Council of Canada's 2010 report "Decisions, Decisions: Family doctors as gatekeepers to prescription drugs and diagnostic imaging in Canada", the Canadian federal government invested $3 billion over 5 years (2000–2005) in relation to diagnostic imaging and agreed to invest a further $2 billion to reduce wait times.  These investments led to an increase in the number of scanners across Canada as well as the number of exams being performed.  The number of CT scanners increased from 198 to 465 and MRI scanners increased from 19 to 266 (more than tenfold) between 1990 and 2009. Similarly, the number of CT exams increased by 58% and MRI exams increased by 100% between 2003 and 2009. In comparison to other OECD countries, including the US, Canada's rates of MRI and CT exams falls somewhere in the middle.  Nevertheless, the Canadian Association of Radiologists claims that as many as 30% of diagnostic imaging scans are inappropriate and contribute no useful information.&lt;ref name=HCC_Decisions2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Decisions,Decisions: Family Doctors as Gatekeepers to Prescription Drugs and Diagnostic Imaging in Canada|url=http://healthcouncilcanada.ca/en/index.php?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=shop.flypage&amp;product_id=116&amp;category_id=20&amp;manufacturer_id=0&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=170|publisher=Health Council of Canada|accessdate=August 9, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827055714/http://healthcouncilcanada.ca/en/index.php?page=shop.product_details&amp;flypage=shop.flypage&amp;product_id=116&amp;category_id=20&amp;manufacturer_id=0&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=170|archivedate=August 27, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malpractice litigation===

The extra cost of [[malpractice]] lawsuits is a proportion of health spending in both the U.S. (1.7% in 2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Limiting Tort Liability for Medical Malpractice | year=2005 |url=http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=4968&amp;type=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada (0.27% in 2001 or $237 million). In Canada the total cost of settlements, legal fees, and insurance comes to $4 per person each year,&lt;ref name="pmid16136632"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson GF, Hussey PS, Frogner BK, Waters HR |title=Health spending in the United States and the rest of the industrialized world |journal=Health Affairs (Project Hope) |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=903–14 |year=2004 |pmid=16136632 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.24.4.903 |url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/24/4/903.full.pdf+html}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the United States it is over $16. Average payouts to American plaintiffs were $265,103, while payouts to Canadian plaintiffs were somewhat higher, averaging $309,417.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=27348 |title=USA Spends More Per Capita on Health Care Than Other Nations, Study Finds |publisher=Medicalnewstoday.com |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051130055246/http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=27348 |archivedate=November 30, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, malpractice suits are far more common in the U.S., with 350% more suits filed each year per person.&lt;ref name="pmid16136632"/&gt; While malpractice costs are significantly higher in the U.S., they make up only a small proportion of total medical spending. The total cost of defending and settling malpractice lawsuits in the U.S. in 2004 was over $28 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Tort Costs and Cross-Border Perspectives: 2005 Update | year=2005 |url=https://www.towersperrin.com/tillinghast/publications/reports/2005_Tort_Cost/2005_Tort.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics say that [[defensive medicine]] consumes up to 9% of American healthcare expenses.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jec.senate.gov/Documents/Hearings/mcclellantestimony28april2005.pdf Testimony of Mark McClellan, MD, PhD, Administrator, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services], before the Joint Economic Committee Hearing on Malpractice Liability Reform, April 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Daniel P.

===Ancillary expenses===
There are a number of ancillary costs that are higher in the U.S. Administrative costs are significantly higher in the U.S.; government mandates on record keeping and the diversity of insurers, plans and administrative layers involved in every transaction result in greater administrative effort. One recent study comparing administrative costs in the two countries found that these costs in the U.S. are roughly double what they are in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Steffie |last=Woolhandler, M.D., M.P.H. |first2=Terry |last2=Campbell, M.H.A. |first3=David U. |last3=Himmelstein, M.D.  |date=August 2003 |title=Costs of Health Care Administration in the United States and Canada

These costs are higher in the U.S., contributing to higher overall costs in that nation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Healthcare outcomes==
In the [[WHO's ranking of health care systems|World Health Organization's rankings of healthcare system performance]] among 191 member nations published in 2000, Canada ranked 30th and the U.S. 37th, while the overall health of Canadians was ranked 35th and Americans 72nd.&lt;ref name="WHO 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/rankings/healthranks.html |title=The World Health Organization's ranking of the world's health systems |publisher=Photius.com |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the WHO's methodologies, which attempted to measure how efficiently health systems translate expenditure into health, generated broad debate and criticism.&lt;ref&gt;Deber, Raisa, [http://www.longwoods.com/product.php?productid=17238&amp;cat=367&amp;page=1 "Why Did the World Health Organization Rate Canada's Health System as 30th? Some Thoughts on League Tables"], Longwoods Review 2 (1). Retrieved on 2008-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers caution against inferring healthcare quality from some health statistics.  June O'Neill and Dave O'Neill point out that "... life expectancy and infant mortality are both poor measures of the efficacy of a health care system because they are influenced by many factors that are unrelated to the quality and accessibility of medical care".&lt;ref name="NBER 2007" /&gt;

In 2007, Gordon H. Guyatt et al. conducted a meta-analysis, or systematic review, of all studies that compared health outcomes for similar conditions in Canada and the U.S., in ''Open Medicine'', an open-access peer-reviewed Canadian medical journal. They concluded, "Available studies suggest that health outcomes may be superior in patients cared for in Canada versus the United States, but differences are not consistent." Guyatt identified 38 studies addressing conditions including cancer, coronary artery disease, chronic medical illnesses and surgical procedures. Of 10 studies with the strongest statistical validity, 5 favoured Canada, 2 favoured the United States, and 3 were equivalent or mixed. Of 28 weaker studies, 9 favoured Canada, 3 favoured the United States, and 16 were equivalent or mixed. Overall, results for mortality favoured Canada with a 5% advantage, but the results were weak and varied. The only consistent pattern was that Canadian patients fared better in kidney failure.&lt;ref name="Open Medicine" /&gt;

In terms of population health, [[life expectancy]] in 2006 was about two and a half years longer in Canada, with Canadians living to an average of 79.9 years and Americans 77.5 years.&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oecdobserver.org/news/get_file.php3/id/25/file/OECDInFigures2006-2007.pdf |title=OECD in Figures 2006–2007 |accessdate=2007-06-21 |format=PDF |work=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infant and child mortality rates are also higher in the U.S.&lt;ref name="OECD" /&gt; Some comparisons suggest that the American system underperforms Canada's system as well as those of other industrialized nations with universal coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/publications_show.htm?doc_id=482678 |title=Commonwealth Fund Study |publisher=Commonwealthfund.org |date=2007-05-15 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a ranking by the World Health Organization of health care system performance among 191 member nations, published in 2000, ranked Canada 30th and the U.S. 37th, and the overall health of Canada 35th to the American 72nd.&lt;ref name="WHO 2000" /&gt;  The WHO did not merely consider health care outcomes, but also placed heavy emphasis on the health disparities between rich and poor, funding for the health care needs of the poor, and the extent to which a country was reaching the potential health care outcomes they believed were possible for that nation. In an international comparison of 21 more specific quality indicators conducted by the Commonwealth Fund International Working Group on Quality Indicators, the results were more divided. One of the indicators was a tie, and in 3 others, data was unavailable from one country or the other. Canada performed better on 11 indicators; such as survival rates for colorectal cancer, [[childhood leukemia]], and kidney and liver transplants. The U.S. performed better on 6 indicators, including survival rates for breast and cervical cancer, and avoidance of childhood diseases such as pertussis and measles.  It should be noted that the 21 indicators were distilled from a starting list of 1000.  The authors state that, "It is an opportunistic list, rather than a comprehensive list."&lt;ref name="pmid15160806"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hussey PS, Anderson GF, Osborn R |title=How does the quality of care compare in five countries? |journal=Health Affairs (Project Hope) |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=89–99 |year=2004 |pmid=15160806 |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.23.3.89 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the difference in outcomes may also be related to lifestyle choices. The OECD found that Americans have slightly higher rates of smoking and alcohol consumption than do Canadians&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt; as well as significantly higher rates of [[obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.ca/english/research/82-620-MIE/2005001/articles/adults/aobesity.htm#5 |title=Adult obesity in Canada: Measured height and weight |publisher=Statcan.ca |date=2008-11-16 |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012011617/http://www.statcan.ca/english/research/82-620-MIE/2005001/articles/adults/aobesity.htm#5 |archivedate=October 12, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A joint US-Canadian study found slightly higher smoking rates among Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhis/jcush_mainpage.htm The Joint Canada/United States Survey of Health (JCUSH).] CDC – National Center for Health Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that Americans have higher rates not only of obesity, but also of other health risk factors and chronic conditions, including physical inactivity, diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&lt;ref name="Lasser et al." /&gt;

While a Canadian [[systematic review]] stated that the differences in the systems of Canada and the United States could not alone explain differences in healthcare outcomes,&lt;ref name="Szick"/&gt; the study didn't consider that over 44,000 Americans die every year due to not having a single payer system for healthcare in the United States and it didn't consider the millions more that live without proper medical care due to a lack of insurance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnhp.org/excessdeaths/health-insurance-and-mortality-in-US-adults.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States and Canada have different racial makeups, different obesity rates and different alcoholism rates, which would likely cause the US to have a shorter average life expectancy and higher infant mortality even with equal healthcare provided. The US population is 12.2% African Americans and 16.3% Hispanic Americans (2010 Census), whereas Canada has only 2.5% African Canadians and 0.97% Hispanic Canadians (2006 Census). African Americans have higher mortality rates than any other racial or ethnic group for eight of the top ten causes of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hummer|first=RA,|author2=Ellison CG|author3=Rogers RG|author4=Moulton BE|author5=Romero RR|title=Religious involvement and adult mortality in the United States: review and perspective|journal=Southern Medical Journal|date=December 2004|volume=97|issue=12|pages=1223–30|pmid=15646761|doi=10.1097/01.SMJ.0000146547.03382.94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cancer incidence rate among African Americans is 10% higher than among European Americans.&lt;ref name=Disparities&gt;American Public Health Association (APHA), Eliminating Health Disparities: Toolkit (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  U.S. Latinos have higher rates of death from diabetes, liver disease, and infectious diseases than do non-Latinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Vega WA, Amaro H |title=Latino outlook: good health, uncertain prognosis |journal=Annual Review of Public Health |volume=15 |pages=39–67 |year=1994 |pmid=8054092 |doi=10.1146/annurev.pu.15.050194.000351}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adult African Americans and Latinos have approximately twice the risk as European Americans of developing diabetes.&lt;ref name="Disparities"/&gt;  The infant mortality rates for African Americans is twice that of whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Rawlings JS, Weir MR |title=Race- and rank-specific infant mortality in a US military population |journal=American Journal of Diseases of Children |volume=146 |issue=3 |pages=313–6 |date=March 1992 |pmid=1543178 |doi=10.1001/archpedi.1992.02160150053020}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, directly comparing infant mortality rates between countries is difficult, as countries have different definitions of what qualifies as an infant death.

Another issue with comparing the two systems is the baseline health of the patient's for which the systems must treat. Canada has only half the obesity rate that the US system must deal with (14.3% vs 30.6%).&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Bmi30chart.png]]&lt;/ref&gt;  On average, obesity reduces life expectancy by 6–7 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peeters A, Barendregt JJ, Willekens F, Mackenbach JP, Al Mamun A, Bonneux L |title=Obesity in adulthood and its consequences for life expectancy: A life-table analysis |journal=Ann.

A 2004 study found that Canada had a slightly higher mortality rate for [[acute myocardial infarction]] (heart attack) because of the more conservative Canadian approach to revascularizing (opening) coronary arteries.&lt;ref name="pmid15381645"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaul P, Armstrong PW, Chang WC |title=Long-term mortality of patients with acute myocardial infarction in the United States and Canada: comparison of patients enrolled in Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO)-I |journal=Circulation |volume=110 |issue=13 |pages=1754–60 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15381645 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000142671.06167.91 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer===
Numerous studies have attempted to compare the rates of cancer incidence and mortality in Canada and the U.S., with varying results. Doctors who study cancer epidemiology warn that the diagnosis of cancer is subjective, and the ''reported'' incidence of a cancer will rise if screening is more aggressive, even if the ''real'' cancer incidence is the same.  Statistics from different sources may not be compatible if they were collected in different ways.  The proper interpretation of cancer statistics has been an important issue for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dickman PW, Adami HO |title=Interpreting trends in cancer patient survival |journal=Journal of Internal Medicine |volume=260 |issue=2 |pages=103–17 |date=August 2006 |pmid=16882274 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2796.2006.01677.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Barry Kramer of the [[National Institutes of Health]] points to the fact that cancer incidence rose sharply over the past few decades as screening became more common.  He attributes the rise to increased detection of benign early stage cancers that pose little risk of metastasizing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/10/health/10skin.html Doctors Balk at Cancer Ad, Citing Lack of Evidence] By CHRISTIE ASCHWANDEN, New York Times, July 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, though patients who were treated for these benign cancers were at little risk, they often have trouble finding health insurance after the fact.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Cancer survival time increases with later years of diagnosis, because cancer treatment improves, so cancer survival statistics can only be compared for cohorts in the same diagnosis year. For example, as doctors in British Columbia adopted new treatments, survival time for patients with metastatic breast cancer increased from 438 days for those diagnosed in 1991–1992, to 667 days for those diagnosed in 1999–2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chia SK, Speers CH, D'yachkova Y |title=The impact of new chemotherapeutic and hormone agents on survival in a population-based cohort of women with metastatic breast cancer |journal=Cancer |volume=110 |issue=5 |pages=973–9 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17647245 |doi=10.1002/cncr.22867 |url=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Centre for Chronic Disease Prevention and Control'', 2004 pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Another international comparison by the National Cancer Institute of Canada indicated that incidence rates for most, but not all, cancers were higher in the U.S. than in Canada during the period studied (1993–1997). Incidence rates for certain types, such as colorectal and stomach cancer, were actually higher in Canada than in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncic.cancer.ca/ncic/internet/standard/0,3621,84658243_85787780_379601028_langId-en,00.html |title=International variation in cancer incidence |accessdate=2007-07-02 |work=National Cancer Institute of Canada |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403064200/http://www.ncic.cancer.ca/ncic/internet/standard/0%2C3621%2C84658243_85787780_379601028_langId-en%2C00.html |archivedate=April 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, researchers published a study comparing health outcomes in the Anglo countries.

A study based on data from 1978 through 1986 found very similar survival rates in both the United States and in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Keller | first = D M |author2=E A Peterson |author3=G Silberman  |date=July 1997 | title = Survival rates for four forms of cancer in the United States and Ontario | journal = Am J Public Health | volume = 87 | issue = 7 | pages = 1164–1167 | pmid = 9240107 | doi =  10.2105/AJPH.87.7.1164| url = | pmc = 1380891  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a study based on data from 1993 through 1997 found lower cancer survival rates among Canadians than among Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Chen VW, Howe HL, Wu XC, Hotes JL, Correa CN (eds).

A few comparative studies have found that cancer survival rates vary more widely among different populations in the U.S. than they do in Canada. Mackillop and colleagues compared cancer survival rates in Ontario and the U.S. They found that cancer survival was more strongly correlated with socio-economic class in the U.S. than in Ontario. Furthermore, they found that the American survival advantage in the four highest quintiles was statistically significant. They strongly suspected that the difference due to prostate cancer was a result of greater detection of asymptomatic cases in the U.S.  Their data indicates that neglecting the prostate cancer data reduces the American advantage in the four highest quintiles and gives Canada a statistically significant advantage in the lowest quintile.  Similarly, they believe differences in screening mammography may explain part of the American advantage in breast cancer.  Exclusion of breast and prostate cancer data results in very similar survival rates for both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boyd C, Zhang-Salomons JY, Groome PA, Mackillop WJ |title=Associations between community income and cancer survival in Ontario, Canada, and the United States |journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology |volume=17 |issue=7 |pages=2244–55 |date=July 1999 |pmid=10561282 |url=http://www.jco.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10561282 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804151849/http://www.jco.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10561282 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hsing et al. found that prostate cancer mortality incidence rate ratios were lower among U.S. whites than among any of the nationalities included in their study, including Canadians. U.S. African Americans in the study had lower rates than any group except for Canadians and U.S. whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hsing AW, Tsao L, Devesa SS |title=International trends and patterns of prostate cancer incidence and mortality |journal=International Journal of Cancer |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=60–7 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10585584 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(20000101)85:1&lt;60::AID-IJC11&gt;3.0.CO;2-B |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Echoing the concerns of Dr. Kramer and Professor Mackillop, Hsing later wrote that reported prostate cancer incidence depends on screening. Among whites in the U.S., the death rate for prostate cancer remained constant, even though the incidence increased, so the additional reported prostate cancers did not represent an increase in real prostate cancers, said Hsing. Similarly, the death rates from prostate cancer in the U.S. increased during the 1980s and peaked in early 1990. This is at least partially due to "attribution bias" on death certificates, where doctors are more likely to ascribe a death to prostate cancer than to other diseases that affected the patient, because of greater awareness of prostate cancer or other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hsing AW, Devesa SS |title=Trends and patterns of prostate cancer: what do they suggest? |journal=Epidemiologic Reviews |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=3–13 |year=2001 |pmid=11588851 |url=http://epirev.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11588851 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.epirev.a000792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because health status is "considerably affected" by socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, such as level of education and income, "the value of comparisons in isolating the impact of the healthcare system on outcomes is limited," according to health care analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Herzlinger RE, Parsa-Parsi R |title=Consumer-driven health care: lessons from Switzerland |journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=292 |issue=10 |pages=1213–20 |date=September 2004 |pmid=15353534 |doi=10.1001/jama.292.10.1213 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts say that the incidence and mortality rates of cancer cannot be combined to calculate survival from cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, B.C.

===Racial and ethnic differences===
The U.S. and Canada differ substantially in their demographics, and these differences may contribute to differences in health outcomes between the two nations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Singh GK, Yu SM |title=Infant mortality in the United States: trends, differentials, and projections, 1950 through 2010 |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=85 |issue=7 |pages=957–64 |date=July 1995 |pmid=7604920 |pmc=1615523 |doi= 10.2105/AJPH.85.7.957|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7604920}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although both countries have white majorities, Canada has a proportionately larger immigrant minority population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ |title=CIA – The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the relative size of different ethnic and racial groups vary widely in each country. [[Hispanics]] and peoples of African descent constitute a much larger proportion of the U.S. population.  Non-Hispanic [[First Nations|North American aboriginal]] peoples constitute a much larger proportion of the Canadian population.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}  Canada also has a proportionally larger [[South Asian]] and [[East Asian]] population.  Also, the proportion of each population that is immigrant is higher in Canada.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

A study comparing aboriginal mortality rates in Canada, the U.S. and New Zealand found that aboriginals in all three countries had greater mortality rates and shorter life expectancies than the white majorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Trovato F |title=Aboriginal mortality in Canada, the United States and New Zealand |journal=Journal of biosocial science |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=67–86 |date=January 2001 |pmid=11316396 |doi= 10.1017/S0021932001000670|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That study also found that aboriginals in Canada had both shorter life expectancies and greater infant mortality rates than aboriginals in the United States and New Zealand.  The health outcome differences between aboriginals and whites in Canada was also larger than in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Though few studies have been published concerning the health of [[Black Canadians]], [[race and health in the United States|health disparities between whites and African Americans]] in the U.S. have received intense scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, C.A., Williams, D.R., Segregation and Mortality: The Deadly Effects of Racism? Sociological Forum, 14, 3, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  African Americans in the U.S. have significantly greater rates of cancer incidence and mortality.  Drs. Singh and Yu found that neonatal and postnatal mortality rates for American African Americans are more than double the non-Hispanic white rate.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  This difference persisted even after controlling for household income and was greatest in the highest income quintile.  A Canadian study also found differences in neonatal mortality between different racial and ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Claydon, J.E., Mitton,, C., Sankaran, K., Lee, S. K., Canadian Neonatal Network, Ethnic Differences in Risk Factors for Neonatal Morality and Morbidity in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, J. Perin., 2007, 27, 448–452.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Canadians of African descent had a greater mortality rate than whites in that study, the rate was somewhat less than double the white rate.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The racially heterogeneous Hispanic population in the U.S. has also been the subject of several studies.  Although members of this group are significantly more likely to live in poverty than are non-Hispanic whites, they often have disease rates that are comparable to or better than the non-Hispanic white majority.  Hispanics have lower cancer incidence and mortality, lower infant mortality, and lower rates of neural tube defects.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/uscs |title=U.S. Cancer Statistics Working Group |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=2010-08-20 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Feuchtbaum LB, Currier RJ, Riggle S, Roberson M, Lorey FW, Cunningham GC |title=Neural tube defect prevalence in California (1990–1994): eliciting patterns by type of defect and maternal race/ethnicity |journal=Genetic testing |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=265–72 |year=1999 |pmid=10495925 |doi=10.1089/109065799316572 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh and Yu found that infant mortality among Hispanic sub-groups varied with the racial composition of that group.  The mostly white Cuban population had a neonatal mortality rate (NMR)  nearly identical to that found in non-Hispanic whites and a postnatal mortality rate (PMR) that was somewhat lower.  The largely [[Mestizo]], Mexican, Central, and South American Hispanic populations had somewhat lower NMR and PMR. The [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Ricans]] who have a mix of white and African ancestry had higher NMR and PMR rates.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Flexibility==
In Canada, increasing demands for healthcare, due to the [[population aging|aging population]], must be met by either increasing taxes or reducing other government programs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In the United States, under the current system, more of the burden will be taken up by the private sector and individuals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Since 1998, Canada's successive multibillion-dollar budget surpluses have allowed a significant injection of new funding to the healthcare system, with the stated goal of reducing waiting times for treatment.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}  However, this may be hampered by the return to deficit spending as of the [[2009 Canadian federal budget]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

One historical problem with the U.S. system was known as [[job lock]], in which people become tied to their jobs for fear of losing their health insurance. This reduces the flexibility of the labor market.&lt;ref&gt;Blomqvist, Åke.

However, providers of group health insurance in many states are permitted to use [[experience rating]] and it remains legal in the United States for prospective employers to investigate a job candidate's health and past health claims as part of a hiring decision.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Someone who has recently been diagnosed with cancer, for example, may face [[job lock]] not out of fear of losing their health insurance, but based on prospective employers not wanting to add the cost of treating that illness to their own health insurance pool, for fear of future insurance rate increases. Thus, being diagnosed with an illness can cause someone to be forced to stay in their current job.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Politics of health==
&lt;!---unless comparisons are used, it makes more sense to keep countries separated here. ---&gt;

===Politics of each country===
&lt;!---needed a super-header here. the above may not be it  :)---&gt;
More imaginative solutions in both countries have come from the sub-national level.

====Canada====
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
In Canada, the right-wing and now defunct [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] and its successor, the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] considered increasing the role of the private sector in the Canadian system.  Public backlash caused these plans to be abandoned, and the Conservative government that followed re-affirmed its commitment to universal public medicine.

In Canada, it was [[Alberta]] under the Conservative government that had experimented most with increasing the role of the private sector in healthcare. Measures included the introduction of private clinics allowed to bill patients for some of the cost of a procedure, as well as 'boutique' clinics offering tailored personal care for a fixed preliminary annual fee.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

====United States====
In the U.S., President [[Bill Clinton]] attempted a [[Clinton health care plan|significant restructuring of health care]], but the effort collapsed under political pressure against it despite tremendous public support.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.princeton.edu/~starr/20starr.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. election]] saw [[prescription drug]]s become a central issue, although the system did not fundamentally change.  In the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. election]] healthcare proved to be an important issue to some voters, though not a primary one.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In 2006, [[Massachusetts]] adopted a [[Massachusetts 2006 Health Reform Statute|plan]] that vastly reduced the number of uninsured making it the state with the lowest percentage of non-insured residents in the union. It requires everyone to buy insurance and subsidizes insurance costs for lower income people on a sliding scale. Some{{Who|date=November 2010}} have claimed that the state's program is unaffordable, which the state itself says is "a commonly repeated myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mahealthconnector.org/portal/binary/com.epicentric.contentmanagement.servlet.ContentDeliveryServlet/Health%2520Care%2520Reform/Overview/Connector%2520Progress%2520Report%252009.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227065451/https://www.mahealthconnector.org/portal/binary/com.epicentric.contentmanagement.servlet.ContentDeliveryServlet/Health%20Care%20Reform/Overview/Connector%20Progress%20Report%2009.pdf |archivedate=December 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, in a minor amendment, the plan did eliminate dental, hospice and skilled nursing care for certain categories of noncitizens covering 30,000 people (victims of human trafficking and domestic violence, applicants for asylum and refugees) who do pay taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/22/AR2009102204684.html |title=In Massachusetts, Obama won't promote state's health-care plan |author=Ceci Connolly |date=2009-10-23 |work= Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/05/proposed_cuts_in_massachusetts.html |title=Proposed cuts in Massachusetts budget threatens health coverage for thousands under new insurance plan |publisher=masslive.com |accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private care===
The Canada Health Act of 1984 "does not directly bar private delivery or private insurance for publicly insured services," but provides financial disincentives for doing so. "Although there are laws prohibiting or curtailing private health care in some provinces, they can be changed," according to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Steinbrook R |title=Private health care in Canada |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |volume=354 |issue=16 |pages=1661–4 |date=April 2006 |pmid=16625005 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp068064 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments attempt to control health care costs by being the sole purchasers and thus they do not allow private patients to bid up prices. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Those with non-emergency illnesses such as cancer cannot pay out of pocket for time-sensitive surgeries and must wait their turn on waiting lists. According to the [[Canadian Supreme Court]] in its 2005 ruling in ''[[Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)|Chaoulli v. Quebec]]'', waiting list delays "increase the patient's risk of mortality or the risk that his or her injuries will become irreparable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/2005/2005scc35/2005scc35.html |title=Chaoulli v.

===Consumer-driven healthcare===
In the United States, Congress has enacted laws to promote [[consumer-driven healthcare]] with [[health savings account]]s (HSAs), which were created by the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare bill]] signed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] on December 8, 2003. HSAs are designed to provide [[tax incentives]] for individuals to save for future qualified medical and retiree health expenses.  Money placed in such accounts is tax-free. To qualify for HSAs, individuals must carry a [[high-deductible health plan]] (HDHP). The higher [[deductible]] shifts some of the financial responsibility for health care from insurance providers to the consumer. This shift towards a market-based system with greater individual responsibility increased the differences between the US and Canadian systems.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Some economists who have studied proposals for universal healthcare worry that the consumer driven healthcare movement will reduce the social redistributive effects of insurance that pools high-risk and low-risk people together. This concern was one of the driving factors behind a provision of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], informally known as ''Obamacare'', which limited the types of purchases which could be made with HSA funds. For example, as of January 1, 2011, these funds can no longer be used to buy [[over-the-counter drug]]s without a [[medical prescription]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |author-link=Malcolm Gladwell |date=2005-08-29 |title=The Moral Hazard Myth |periodical=[[The New Yorker]] |url=http://www.gladwell.com/2005/2005_08_29_a_hazard.html |accessdate=2007-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630194634/http://www.gladwell.com/2005/2005_08_29_a_hazard.html |archivedate=June 30, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2294">'''Dead checking''' is U.S. military jargon for the practice of verifying the death of [[Iraqi insurgency (2003–11)|Iraqi insurgents]] and the subsequent killing of those who remain alive when U.S. Armed Forces enter an insurgent house in hot battle as part of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].

The term was in use as early as November 2004 when reporter Evan Wright of [[The Village Voice]] quoted an unnamed enlisted U.S. Marine and Iraq war veteran as saying, "They teach us to do dead-checking when we're clearing rooms.  You put two bullets into the guy's chest and one in the brain. But when you enter a room where guys are wounded you might not know if they're alive or dead. So they teach us to dead-check them by pressing them in the eye with your boot, because generally a person, even if he's faking being dead, will flinch if you poke him there. If he moves, you put a bullet in the brain. You do this to keep the momentum going when you're flowing through a building. You don't want a guy popping up behind you and shooting you."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/dead-check-in-falluja-6399178 Dead-Check in Falluja]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was used again by the [[Associated Press]] in July 2007, when Corporal Saul H. Lopezromo, a defense witness in the murder trial of Corporal [[Trent D. Thomas]] testified that the procedure of dead checking was routine and stated, "I don't see it as an execution, sir, I see it as killing the enemy."  Lopezromo later added, "If somebody is worth shooting once, they're worth shooting twice."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/law/07/15/marines.iraq.ap/index.html?iref=topnews Marine testimony: All Iraqi men viewed as insurgents]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://localnewsleader.com/jackson/stories/index.php?action=fullnews&amp;id=133238 Marine: Beating of Iraqis became routine]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Los Angeles Times]] in July 2007 reported that Corporal Lopezromo testified, "Marines are taught dead-checking in boot camp, the School of Infantry at Camp Pendleton, and the pre-deployment training at Twentynine Palms called Mojave Viper."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-marines15jul15,1,1868662.story?coll=la-headlines-world Marine says beatings urged in Iraq]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10582">[[Disability]] is poorly documented in the [[Middle Ages]], though disabled people constituted a large part of Medieval society as part of the [[peasant]]ry, clergy, and nobility. Very little was written or recorded about a general disabled community at the time, but their existence has been preserved through religious texts and some medical journals.

== Disability in culture ==
The disabled community were a definite part of Medieval society. Disability was not considered an extraordinary quality among the medieval people and therefore were not heavily documented. Disability as a category of impairment was not seen in Medieval language, but rather terms such as "blynde", "dumbe", and "lame" were seen to attribute those with physical impairments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/research/inclusive-heritage/disability-history/1050-1485/|title=Disability in the medieval period 1050-1485|last=|first=|date=2016|website=historicengland.org.uk|publisher=Historic England|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of disability being undesirable or unholy stemmed from the later [[Eugenics|Eugenics movement]] that began in the early 20th Century. Many scholars, such as [[Henri-Jacques Stiker]], author of [[A History of Disability]], would argue that people living with disabilities "were no less undistinguished at the dawn of the Middle Ages from the economically weak."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Disability|last=Stiker|first=Henri-Jacques|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=1999|isbn=0-472-11063-2|location=United States|pages=67|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the intensive labor that constituted agriculture during this time period, many peasants and serfs have been found with extensive spinal and limb injuries, as well as stunted growth, malnutrition and general deformity.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Disabled people were found among all parts of society. Monarchs across Europe were noted as having those with [[Dwarfism|short stature]], hunchbacks, or others with disabilities in their courts where they filled roles such as that of the King's Fool or [[Jester|court jester]]. This rank gave the disabled person a level of prestige. They were allowed to mock or tell the truth to the ruler, even if it displeased them to hear it.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Disability|last=Stiker|first=Henri-Jacques|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=1999|isbn=0-472-11063-2|location=United States|pages=70|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disability in religion ==
[[Christianity]], the dominant religion in western Europe, held mixed views on disability. Within [[Bible|the Bible]], disability was aligned with sin and punishment, but also with healing and [[martyr]]dom.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Disability in Medieval Europe: Thinking about physical impairment during the high Middle Ages, c.1100-1400|last=Metzler|first=Irina|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=0-415-36503-1|location=Oxon|pages=46–47|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Medieval priests and scholars believed that a body would be corrupted by sin and therefore divine punishment took the form of physical illnesses. However, opposing schools of thought revolved around the concept that those with disabilities showed a higher form of piety than those who did not have physical impairments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The Bible ===
{{Main article|The Bible}}
In the [[Old Testament]], [[God]] gave people disabilities as a form of divine punishment, with the root of it being a payment for the sins they have committed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In the [[New Testament]], there is much more content concerning healing and the miracles performed by Jesus Christ.

=== Canon Law ===
[[Canon Law]], the legal codes that the Catholic Church followed, contained few restrictions against those with disabilities, such as the barring of physically disabled from becoming holy men. However, there were contradictory laws within the codes, allowing for those who were disabled after reaching priesthood to be able to move up the hierarchy and become bishops.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 enacted a law that linked bodily infirmity to ''sometimes'' be caused by sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medicine, Society, and Faith in the Ancient and Medieval Worlds|last=Amundsen|first=Darrel|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0801863547|location=Baltimore, MD and London|pages=266|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Medieval physicians were asked to hear their patients confessions so that their soul would be "cured" before the body was assessed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Charity ===
Among the monasteries and churches of Medieval Europe, charity was often given to those seen as disadvantaged or impaired. The disabled community were among the largest of groups to have benefited from the charity of local monks and priests.

France's [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] (Saint Louis) granted blind people a rare legal right to beg on the streets of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wheatley|first=Edward|year=2002|title=Blindness, Discipline, and Reward: Louis IX and the Foundation of the Hospice des Quinze Vingts|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/385/517|journal=Disability Studies Quarterly|volume=22:4|pages=194–212|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disability in medieval medicine ==
{{Main article|Medieval medicine of Western Europe}}
Within the medical world of the Middle Ages, illness and disability were causally linked to sin. Since religion played a large role within Medieval society, many of the changes and deformities to the human body were attributed to one's sins, dating back to Original Sin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There were mixed reactions and perspectives of people with disabilities, because different groups of Christians viewed disabilities in different ways.

Generally, Medieval physicians attributed much of their work to a combination of the ability to treat illness, such as fever and blisters, and religious faith. If an illness or physical impairment did not subside over time, it was considered an "incurable illness" and therefore was deemed as an act of God.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Disability|last=Stiker|first=Henri-Jacques|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=1999|isbn=0-472-11063-2|location=United States|pages=68|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental disorders were often classified under demonic possession, as they were not within the physician's ability to diagnose or treat at the time and therefore patients with mental disorders were left to pray for divine healing. [citation needed]

Within the High Middle Ages, an almshouse in the [[City of London]] began caring for people with mental disabilities, and [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bethlem hospital]] became the first mental institution in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Bethlem|last=Andrews|first=Jonathan|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=0415017734|location=London &amp; New York|pages=1–2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leprosy ===
Lepers offered one of the most familiar images of disability in the medieval period. A disease that affected many throughout medieval Europe, [[leprosy]] was caused by a combination of poor hygiene and lack of resources such as proper treatments for the disease. At the time, there were mixed feelings about this group. Some, such as [[Francis of Assisi]], argued that lepers were those who transformed themselves into the images of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] and were to be treated as living symbol for his martyrdom.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Others, especially after the [[Bubonic plague|Bubonic Plague]] began to ravage Europe towards the Late Medieval period, condemned the lepers as sinful and having been the very people to spread the plague. To stop the spread of the horrifying disease, officials put individuals displaying symptoms and sometimes family members into [[Leper colony|leper houses]]. They were often in secluded locations and fashioned after [[Monastery|monasteries]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Glass delusion ===
A few notable cases of [[glass delusion]] occurred during the Late Middle Ages. This mental disorder involved a person believing that they were made of glass and that they were fragile, able to break or shatter upon impact.

=== Melancholia ===
[[Melancholia]] was believed to be caused by an imbalance of the [[Humorism|Four humours]] within the human body, where an excess of black bile caused depression-like symptoms of sadness and sluggish, lethargic behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://loki.stockton.edu/~kinsellt/projects/pom/storyReader$7.html|title=18th-Century Theories of Melancholy &amp; Hypochondria|last=Dufala|first=Daniel|date=April 29, 2001|website=loki.stockton.edu|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further information|List of mentally ill monarchs}}
Though disability was present throughout the Middle Ages, very few cases were documented during the Early and High Medieval periods, as few physicians could properly diagnose many conditions.

* King [[Henry VI of England]] (1421–1471; ruled 1422–1461 and 1470–1471)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Distant Mirror|last=Tuchman|first=Barbara|publisher=Ballatine Books|year=1978|isbn=0-345-30145-5|location=New York|pages=586|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nicasius Voerda]], born [[Visual impairment|blind]] and attended [[Old University of Leuven|Louvain University]] in 1459, qualifying in arts and theology, later enrolling in [[University of Cologne]] in 1489 and earning a doctorate of canon law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=English University Life|last=Cobban|first=Alan|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=978-1857285178|location=Cambridge|pages=19|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aelred of Rievaulx]] (1110–1167), English writer, abbot, and saint, suffered from self-inflicted malnutrition ([[fasting]]), as well as severe [[arthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life of Ailred of Rievaulx|last=Daniel|first=Walter|publisher=Cistercian Publications|year=1994|isbn=978-0879072575|location=London|pages=39–41|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(2018). “Climate Change”. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.who.int/heli/risks/climate/climatechange/en/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, a neglected aspect of the [[climate change debate]], much less research has been conducted on the impacts of climate change on health, food supply, [[economic growth]], [[Environmental migrant|migration]], security, societal change, and [[public good]]s, such as [[drinking water]], than on the [[geophysical]] changes related to [[global warming]]. Human impacts can be both negative and positive. Climatic changes in [[Siberia]], for instance, are expected to improve food production and local economic activity, at least in the short to medium term. Whereas, Bangladesh has experienced an increase in climate-sensitive diseases such as malaria, dengue, childhood diarrhoea, and pneumonia, among vulnerable communities.&lt;ref&gt;Kabir, M. I., Rahman, M. B., Smith, W., Lusha, M. A. F., &amp; Milton, A. H. (2016). Climate change and health in Bangladesh: a baseline cross-sectional survey. ''Global Health Action, 9'', 29609. doi:10.3402/gha.v9.29609&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies suggest, however, that the [[Effects of global warming|current and future impacts of climate change]] on human society are and will continue to be overwhelmingly negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghfgeneva.org/Portals/0/pdfs/human_impact_report.pdf|title=Ghfgeneva.org|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410201542/http://www.ghfgeneva.org/Portals/0/pdfs/human_impact_report.pdf|archivedate=10 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/resources/policy/climate_change/downloads/research_what_happened_to_seasons.pdf|title=Oxfam GB - leading UK charity fighting global poverty|work=Oxfam GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the adverse effects of climate change are experienced by poor and low-income communities around the world, who have much higher levels of vulnerability to environmental determinants of health, [[wealth]] and other factors, and much lower levels of capacity available for coping with environmental change. A report on the global human impact of climate change published by the [[Global Humanitarian Forum]] in 2009, estimated more than 300,000 deaths and about $125 billion in economic losses each year, and indicating that most climate change induced mortality is due to worsening floods and droughts in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Climate Change - The Anatomy of a Silent Crisis |url=http://www.ghf-ge.org/human-impact-report.pdf |website=Global Humanitarian Forum |publisher=Global Humanitarian Forum |accessdate=9 August 2018 |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key vulnerabilities==
Most of the key vulnerabilities to climate change are related to climate phenomena that exceed thresholds for adaptation; such as extreme weather events or abrupt climate change, as well as limited access to resources (financial, technical, human, institutional) to cope. In 2007, the IPCC published a report of key vulnerabilities of industry, settlements, and society to climate change.&lt;ref name=wilbanks&gt;
{{cite web

|accessdate=20 May 2009|display-authors=etal}}. [http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4-wg2-chapter7.pdf PDF version] with page numbers.
&lt;/ref&gt; This assessment included a level of confidence for each key vulnerability:
*'''Very high confidence''': Interactions between climate change and urbanization: this is most notable in developing countries, where urbanization is often focused in vulnerable coastal areas.
*'''High confidence''':
**Interactions between climate change and global economic growth: Stresses due to climate change are not only linked to the impacts of climate change, but also to the impacts of climate change policies. For example, these policies might affect development paths by requiring high cost fuel choices.
**Fixed physical infrastructures that are important in meeting human needs: These include infrastructures that are susceptible to damage from extreme weather events or sea level rise, and infrastructures that are already close to being inadequate.
*'''Medium confidence''': Interactions with governmental and social cultural structures that already face other pressures, e.g., limited economic resources.

==Health==
{{main|Effects of climate change on human health}}

Climate change poses a wide range of risks to population health – risks that will increase in future decades, often to critical levels, if global climate change continues on its current trajectory.&lt;ref name=Lancet&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=A.J. McMichael |author2=R. Woodruff |author3=S. Hales |title=Climate Change and Human Health: Present and Future Risks|journal=[[Lancet (journal)|Lancet]]|year=2006|volume=367|pages=859–69|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68079-3|pmid=16530580|issue=9513}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main categories of health risks include: (i) direct-acting effects (e.g. due to [[heat wave]]s, amplified [[air pollution]], and physical weather disasters), (ii) impacts mediated via climate-related changes in ecological systems and relationships (e.g. crop yields, [[mosquito]] ecology, marine productivity), and (iii) the more diffuse (indirect) consequences relating to impoverishment, displacement, resource conflicts (e.g. water), and post-disaster mental health problems.

Climate change thus threatens to slow, halt or reverse international progress towards reducing child under-nutrition, deaths from [[diarrheal disease]]s and the spread of other [[infectious diseases]]. Climate change acts predominantly by exacerbating the existing, often enormous, health problems, especially in the poorer parts of the world. Current variations in weather conditions already have many adverse impacts on the health of poor people in developing nations,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wmo.int/pages/publications/bulletin_en/documents/57_4_short_en.pdf [[WMO]]&lt;/ref&gt; and these too are likely to be 'multiplied' by the added stresses of climate change.

A changing climate thus affects the prerequisites of population health: clean air and water, sufficient food, natural constraints on infectious disease agents, and the adequacy and security of shelter. A warmer and more variable climate leads to higher levels of some [[air pollutant]]s. It increases the rates and ranges of transmission of infectious diseases through unclean water and contaminated food, and by affecting [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] organisms (such as [[mosquitoes]]) and intermediate or reservoir host species that harbour the infectious agent (such as cattle,&lt;ref name="LundeLindtjorn 2013CattleClimate"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://peerj.com/articles/55/ |author1=Lunde, T.M.  |author2=Lindtjørn, B. | year=2013 | title= Cattle and climate in Africa: How climate variability has influenced national cattle holdings from 1961–2008 | journal=[[PeerJ (journal)|PeerJ]] | doi=10.7717/peerj.55 | volume = 1 | pages = e55 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[bat]]s and [[rodents]]). Changes in temperature, rainfall and seasonality compromise agricultural production in many regions, including some of the least developed countries, thus jeopardising child health and growth and the overall health and functional capacity of adults. As warming proceeds, the severity (and perhaps frequency) of weather-related disasters will increase – and appears to have done so in a number of regions of the world over the past several decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.climate-insurance.org/front_content.php?idcat=885 | author= Munich Climate-Insurance Initiative | year=2013 | title= Climate Change and Rising Weather Related Disasters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in summary, global warming, together with resultant changes in food and water supplies, can indirectly cause increases in a range of adverse health outcomes, including [[malnutrition]], [[diarrhea]], [[injuries]], [[cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular]] and [[respiratory disease]]s, and water-borne and insect-transmitted diseases.

Health equity and climate change have a major impact on human health and quality of life, and are interlinked in a number of ways. The report of the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health points out that disadvantaged communities are likely to shoulder a disproportionate share of the burden of climate change because of their increased exposure and vulnerability to health threats. Over 90 percent of [[malaria]] and diarrhea deaths are borne by children aged 5 years or younger, mostly in developing countries.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/2004_report_update/en/index.html|title=WHO - The global burden of disease: 2004 update|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other severely affected population groups include women, the elderly and people living in [[Small Island Developing States|small island developing states]] and other coastal regions, mega-cities or mountainous areas.&lt;ref name="hdr.undp.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_20072008_EN_Complete.pdf |title=- Human Development Reports |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429033726/http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_20072008_EN_Complete.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological impacts===
{{Further|Effects of global warming on human health#Mental health}}
A 2011 article in the ''[[American Psychologist]]'' identified three classes of psychological impacts from global climate change:&lt;ref name="Doherty"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Doherty, Thomas J. |author2=Clayton, Susan |year=2011|title=The psychological impacts of global climate change|journal=PsycNET|volume=66|issue=4|pages=265–276|doi= 10.1037/a0023141|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/66/4/265/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Direct - "Acute or traumatic effects of extreme weather events and a changed environment"
*Indirect - "Threats to emotional well-being based on observation of impacts and concern or uncertainty about future risks"
*Psychosocial – "Chronic social and community effects of heat, drought, migrations, and climate-related conﬂicts, and postdisaster adjustment"   A psychological impact is shown through peoples behaviours and how they act towards the actual situation. The topic of climate change is very complex and difficult for people to understand, which effects how they act upon it. It is shown by Ranney and Clark(2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ranney|first=Michael Andrew|last2=Clark|first2=Dav|date=2016-01-01|title=Climate Change Conceptual Change: Scientific Information Can Transform Attitudes|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tops.12187/abstract|journal=Topics in Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=8|issue=1|pages=49–75|doi=10.1111/tops.12187|issn=1756-8765}}&lt;/ref&gt; that by informing people to make them understand the topic of climate science clearly, it promotes the change in behaviour towards mitigation of climate change.

===Extreme weather events===
{{Further|Extreme weather}}
This trend towards more variability and fluctuation is perhaps more important, in terms of its impact on human health, than that of a gradual and long-term trend towards higher average temperature.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt; Infectious disease often accompanies [[extreme weather]] events, such as floods, earthquakes and drought. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}} These local epidemics occur due to loss of infrastructure, such as hospitals and sanitation services, but also because of changes in local ecology and environment.

===Diseases===
{{further|Effects of global warming on infectious diseases}}
Climate change may lead to dramatic increases in prevalence of a variety of infectious diseases. Beginning in the mid-'70s, there has been an “emergence, resurgence and redistribution of infectious diseases”.&lt;ref name=Epstein&gt;{{Cite journal|author=P. Epstein|year=2002|title=Climate Change and Infectious Disease: Stormy Weather Ahead?|journal=[[Epidemiology (journal)|Epidemiology]]|volume=13|issue=4|pages=373–375|doi=10.1097/00001648-200207000-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons for this are likely multi-causal, dependent on a variety of social, environmental and climatic factors, however, many argue that the “volatility of infectious disease may be one of the earliest biological expressions of climate instability”.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt; Though many infectious diseases are affected by changes in climate, vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, [[dengue fever]] and leishmaniasis, present the strongest [[Causality|causal relationship]]. One major reason that change in climate increases the prevalence of vector borne disease is that temperature and rainfall play a key role in the distribution, magnitude, and viral capacity of mosquitoes, who are primary vectors for many vector borne diseases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Misslin, R., Telle, O., Daudé, E., Vaguet, A., &amp; Paul, R.

Beyond distribution, rising temperatures can decrease viral incubation time ''in vivo'' in vectors increasing the viral transmissibility leading to increases in infection rates.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J.Y., Lun, Z.R., James, A.A., Chen, X.G., 2010.

====Malaria====
Increased [[precipitation]] like [[rain]] could increase the number of [[mosquito]]s indirectly by expanding larval habitat and food supply. Malaria kills approximately 300,000 children (under age 5) annually, poses an [[imminent threat]] through temperature increase .&lt;ref name=malaria&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=J. Patz |author2=S.

[[File:Aedes aegypti CDC9253.tif|thumb|Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that is the vector for dengue transmission. ]]
'''Dengue''' 

There are 4 distinct viruses responsible for Dengue: DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. [[Dengue fever]] is spread by the bite of the female mosquito known as [[Aedes aegypti|''Aedes aegypti.'']] This species of mosquito can travel up to 400 meters in search of water to lay their eggs, but often remain closer to human habitation. A [[mosquito]] becomes infected with dengue when it bites and takes the blood of an infected human. After approximately one week, the mosquito can then transmit the dengue infection to other humans through her bite. While dengue cannot be spread from person to person, an infected person can infect more mosquitos, thus, furthering the spread of the disease. Overall, the female mosquito is a highly effective vector of this disease&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (n.d.) Dengue control: dengue/severe dengue frequently asked questions. Retrieved from: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.who.int/denguecontrol/faq/en/index5.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. 

When bitten by an infected mosquito, dengue has an [[incubation period]] of 4-10 days. Once infected with the dengue virus, humans experience severe flu-like symptoms. Also known as "break-bone fever", dengue can affect infants, children, and adults and can be fatal. Those infected exhibit a [[high fever]] (40°C/ 104°F) along with at least two of the following symptoms: severe headache, pain behind the eye, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands, muscle and joint pains, and rash. These symptoms usually last 2-7 days. Dengue can become fatal due to plasma leaking, fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or organ impairment. Warning signs of this include a decrease in temperature decrease (below 38°C/ 100°F) in conjunction with: severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, rapid breathing, bleeding gums, blood in vomit, and/or fatigue and restlessness.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (n.d.).  Dengue control: the human. Retrieved from: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.who.int/denguecontrol/human/en/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the mosquito, ''Aedes aegypti'', lives and the amount of mosquitos present is strongly influenced by the amount of water-bearing containers or pockets of standstill water in an area, daily temperature and variation in temperature, moisture, and solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;Patz, J. A., Campbell-Lendrum, D., Holloway, T., &amp; Foley, J. A. (2005). Impact of regional climate change on human health. ''Nature, 438''(7066), 310-317. doi:10.1038/nature04188&lt;/ref&gt; While dengue fever is primarily considered a tropical and subtropical disease, the geographic ranges of the aedes aegypti are expanding. Globalization, trade, travel, demographic trends, and warming temperatures are all attributed to the recent spread to this primary vector of dengue.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Ebia, K.L. &amp; Nealon, J. (2016). Dengue in a changing climate. ''Environmental Research, 151, 115-123.'' &lt;/ref&gt; 

Dengue is now ranked as the most important vector-borne viral disease in the world. Today, an estimated 50–100 million dengue fever infections occur annually.  In just the past 50 years, transmission has increased drastically with new cases of the disease (incidence) increasing 30-fold.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Once localized to a few areas in the tropics, dengue fever is now endemic in over 100 countries in Southeast Asia, the Americas, Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, and the Western Pacific with Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific regions being the most seriously affected. Recently the number of reported cases has continually increased along with dengue spreading to new areas. Explosive outbreaks are also occurring. Moreover, there is the possible threat of outbreak in Europe with local transmission of dengue being reported for the first time in France and Croatia in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (n.d.) Neglected tropical diseases: dengue. Retrieved from: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.searo.who.int/entity/vector_borne_tropical_diseases/data/data_factsheet/en/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

One country that has seen significant impacts from dengue is [[Bangladesh]]. Dengue has been endemic in Bangladesh since its first major outbreak in 2000.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Rahman, A.. 2008. "Climate Change and its Impact on health in Bangladesh". Regional Health Forum (12): 16-26.

http://ngof.org/wdb_new/sites/default/files/Climate%20change%20and%20its%20Impact%20on%20Health%20in%20Bangladesh.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; With its high population, shifting weather patterns, and low and flat geography that is only one meter above sea level, Bangladesh is also one of the world’s most vulnerable countries when it comes to climate change&lt;ref&gt;Chowdhury FR, Ibrahim QSU, Bari M.S, Alam MMJ, Dunachie SJ, Rodriguez-Morales AJ, et al. (2018) "The association between temperature, rainfall and humidity with common climate sensitive infectious diseases in Bangladesh". PLoS ONE 13(6): e0199579. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1371/&lt;/nowiki&gt; journal.pone.0199579&lt;/ref&gt;  Climate change is predicted to increase temperatures and precipitation, both of which affect dengue transmission, as dengue is weather dependent, and most often occurs in wetter and warmer climates.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Morales, I., Salje, H., Saha, S., &amp; Gurley, E. (2016). "Seasonal Distribution and Climate Correlates of Dengue Disease in Dhaka, Bangladesh". Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg., 94(6): 1359–1361 doi:10.4269/ajtmh.15-0846&lt;/ref&gt; Standing water allows habitats and breeding grounds for the mosquito vector, while warmer temperatures assist in larval development, replication of the virus, and period of infectivity.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Banu, S., Wenbiao H., Yuming G., Hurst, C.,  &amp; Tong, S.(2014). "Projecting the Impact of Climate Change on Dengue Transmission in Dhaka, Bangladesh". Environment International (63): 137-142. DOI: 10.1016/j.envint.2013.11.002

&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found lag effects of, on average, two months between high temperatures and dengue transmission&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;, indicating the time that has lapsed between observed weather changes and new observed dengue cases.
[[File:Skyscraper City View Dhaka at Panthapath More.jpg|thumb|City of Dhaka]]
[[Dhaka]] is Bangladesh's biggest city, and also the highest risk area in Bangladesh for transmission of dengue, with its topical climate and population of approximately 11.8 million people.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The annual average temperature in Dhaka is 25°C and almost all of the average rainfall occurs during May through September.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; If higher temperature and increased precipitation continue, we could see temperatures increase and the rainy season extended, leading to an increased transmission period for dengue. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

There were 25,059 cases of dengue in Dhaka from 2000 to 2010, with an average of 168 cases a month&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. While dengue testing is frequently performed in the private health care setting; it is frequently underperformed in the public health care setting, due to lack of testing accessibility&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. This indicates that there are potentially more cases of dengue than are getting diagnosed or reported.

Dengue incidence has only increased in the last few decades, and is projected to continue to do so with changing climate conditions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There have been prediction models of temperature created to project the effects of global warming on the planet. Based on these, the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] estimates that the mean annual temperature of [[Southeast Asia]] will have increased by 3.3 degrees Celsius by 2100, assuming no other changes.. Taking this estimate, researchers predict an increase of 16, 030 cases in Dhaka, Bangladesh by the year 2100. This represents a 40-times increase in dengue incidence.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Increased [[public health surveillance]] and preparation is needed in areas like Bangladesh that are seeing an upward trend in climatic changes and [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector-borne disease]] like dengue virus. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

====Non-climatic determinants====
Sociodemographic factors include, but are not limited to: patterns of [[human migration]] and travel, effectiveness of [[public health]] and medical infrastructure in controlling and treating disease, the extent of [[Malaria|anti-malarial]] [[drug resistance]]  and the underlying health status  of the population at hand.&lt;ref name=infectious&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=J.

McMichael|journal=Climate Change and Human Health: Risks and Responses|location=Geneva|publisher=World Health Organization |editor2=D. Campbell-Lendrum |editor3=C. Corvalan |editor4=K. Ebi |editor5=A. Githeko |editor6=J. Scheraga |editor7=A. Woodward}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental factors include: changes in [[Land use|land-use]] (e.g. deforestation), expansion of agricultural and water development projects (which tend to increase mosquito breeding habitat), and the overall trend towards urbanization (i.e. increased concentration of human hosts). Patz and Olson argue that these changes in landscape can alter local weather more than long term climate change.&lt;ref name=malaria/&gt; For example, the [[deforestation]] and cultivation of natural swamps in the African highlands has created conditions favourable for the survival of mosquito larvae, and has, in part, led to the increasing incidence of malaria.&lt;ref name=malaria/&gt; The effects of these non-climatic factors complicate things and make a direct causal relationship between climate change and malaria difficult to confirm. It is highly unlikely that climate exerts an isolated effect.

'''Preparing for the Future'''

Effective policies which take into consideration predictive climate change models and measures are key to preparing for and managing changes in incidence and reestablishment of diseases.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Ebi, K. L., &amp; Nealon, J. (2016). "Dengue in a changing climate". ''Environmental Research, 151'', 115-123 &lt;/ref&gt; As climate change continues to alter where diseases are prevalent, harmonizing surveillance systems on a multi-national scale will be vital to improve evidence-based disease control and decision making.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Implementation of vaccination and other prevention measures as well as increasing community education and awareness and education of the impacts of the disease and other adverse health events among public decision makers will help prepare and combat changes in disease rates and location.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Environment==
Climate change may dramatically impact [[habitat loss]], for example, [[arid]] conditions may cause the [[deforestation]] of [[rainforest]]s, as has occurred in the past.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFalconLang 2010RainforestCollapse"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sahney, S. |author2=Benton, M.J. |author3=Falcon-Lang, H.J. |year=2010 |title=Rainforest collapse triggered Pennsylvanian tetrapod diversification in Euramerica |journal=[[Geology (journal) |Geology]] |doi=10.1130/G31182.1 |volume=38 |pages=1079–1082 |issue=12 |bibcode=2010Geo....38.1079S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature===
A sustained [[wet-bulb temperature]] exceeding 35°C is a threshold at which the resilience of human systems is no longer able to adequately cool the skin. A study by NOAA from 2013 concluded that heat stress will reduce labor capacity considerably under current emissions scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/news-app/story.77 |author1=John P.

John | year=2013 | title= Heat stress reduces labor capacity under climate warming | journal=Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory | doi=10.1038/nclimate1827|bibcode = 2013NatCC...3..563D }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence to show that high temperatures can increase mortality rates among fetuses and children&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/43755227.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the main focus is often on the health impacts and risks of higher temperatures, it should be remembered that they also reduce learning and worker productivity, which can impact a country's economy and development.

'''Low Temperature'''

Climate change contributes to cold snaps due to disruptions in the [[Polar vortex|polar vortex,]] which in turn is caused by a [[Arctic sea ice decline|decline in Arctic sea ice]], and will cause frigid, cold air to spill from the Arctic and into areas of the northern hemisphere that usually don't experience such cold temperatures, such as the North American southeast, mid-west, northeast, and parts of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02022018/cold-weather-polar-vortex-jet-stream-explained-global-warming-arctic-ice-climate-change|title=Polar Vortex: How the Jet Stream and Climate Change Bring on Cold Snaps|date=2018-02-02|work=InsideClimate News|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a predicted short-term effect of climate change in the winter. This brings along extreme cold temperatures for a short period of time, and results in large scale disruption to human life. A statistic from data on the [[Early 2014 North American cold wave|winter season of 2013-14]] found that of the most notable of the winter storms - most of which were caused by the disruption of the polar vortex - caused $263 Million Dollars in damage, 32 fatalities, and 9 injuries&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/storm_summaries/event_reviews/2013-2014ColdSeasonArticle.pdf|title=Major Winter Weather Events during the 2013-2014

Furthermore, infrastructure damage in the form of closed roads, schools, airports, and other civil functions occurred throughout the northeast, and in some parts of the Midwestern and Southeastern United States.  at the JFK International Airport in Chicago in the 2014 cold snap where a commercial airliner skidded off the runway and into a nearby snowbank&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;. [[2013–14 North American winter|The winter season of 2013-2014]] also caused some crop damage as shown in Ohio losing 97% of their grape harvest&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cfaes.osu.edu/news/articles/most-ohio%E2%80%99s-2014-wine-grape-crop-lost-due-polar-vortex-ohio-state-survey-finds|title=Most of Ohio’s 2014 Wine Grape Crop Lost Due to Polar Vortex, Ohio State Survey Finds|website=cfaes.osu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Further harvests in the following years were also affected as freeze damage reached deep into the trunks of some plants killing off the plant. The total damages extended to roughly $4 Million Dollars, impacting Ohio's economy and wine production. Cold Events are expected to increase in the short term while in the long term the increasing global temperature is going to give way to more heat related events.

===Water===
{{See also|Water crisis}}

The [[freshwater]] resources that humans rely on are highly sensitive to variations in weather and climate.

As the climate warms, it changes the nature of global rainfall, evaporation, snow, stream flow and other factors that affect water supply and quality. Specific impacts include:
*Warmer water temperatures affect water quality and accelerate [[water pollution]].&lt;ref name=ISSE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isse.ucar.edu/water_climate/impacts.html|title=Dr. Kathleen Miller's Research: Climate Change Impacts on Water|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Displacement and migration==
{{See also|Environmental migrant}}
[[File:Refugee camp.jpg|thumbnail|right|A refugee camp]]

Climate change causes displacement of people in several ways, the most obvious—and dramatic—being through the increased number and severity of weather-related disasters which destroy homes and habitats causing people to seek shelter or livelihoods elsewhere. Effects of climate change such as [[desertification]] and [[rising sea levels]] gradually erode livelihood and force communities to abandon traditional homelands for more accommodating environments. This is currently happening in areas of Africa’s [[Sahel]], the semi-arid belt that spans the continent just below its northern deserts. Deteriorating environments triggered by climate change can also lead to increased conflict over resources which in turn can displace people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5888|title=Environment a Growing Driver in Displacement of People|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[IPCC]] has estimated that 150 million environmental migrants will exist by the year 2050, due mainly to the effects of coastal flooding, shoreline erosion and agricultural disruption.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050223042051/http://www.risingtide.nl/greenpepper/envracism/refugees.html Hidden statistics: environmental refugees] Hidden statistics: environmental refugees.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the IPCC also cautions that it is extremely difficult to measure the extent of environmental migration due to the complexity of the issue and a lack of data.&lt;ref name=wilbanks /&gt;

According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, more than 42 million people were displaced in Asia and the Pacific during 2010 and 2011, more than twice the population of Sri Lanka. This figure includes those displaced by storms, floods, and heat and cold waves. Still others were displaced drought and sea-level rise. Most of those compelled to leave their homes eventually returned when conditions improved, but an undetermined number became migrants, usually within their country, but also across national borders.&lt;ref&gt;Bogumil Terminski, [http://www.cedem.ulg.ac.be/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Environmentally-Induced-Displacement-Terminski-1.pdf Environmentally-Induced Displacement. Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges.] CEDEM, Université de Liège, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Asia and the Pacific is the global area most prone to natural disasters, both in terms of the absolute number of disasters and of populations affected. It is highly exposed to climate impacts, and is home to highly vulnerable population groups, who are disproportionately poor and marginalized. A recent Asian Development Bank report highlights “environmental hot spots” that are particular risk of flooding, [[cyclones]], [[typhoons]], and water stress.&lt;ref name="beta.adb.org"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150406002645/http://beta.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2012/addressing-climate-change-migration.pdf Addressing Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Pacific Ocean island nations, such as [[Tuvalu]], [[Kiribati]], and the [[Maldives]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/40789/title/First_wave|title=First wave|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are considering the eventual possibility of evacuation, as flood defense may become economically unrealistic. Tuvalu already has an ad hoc agreement with New Zealand to allow phased relocation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/climatechange/story/0,12374,1063181,00.html Unnatural disasters] ''Andrew Simms'' The Guardian October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; However, for some islanders relocation is not an option. They are not willing to leave their homes, land and families. Some simply don’t know the threat that climate change has on their island and this is mainly down to the lack of awareness that climate change even exists. In Vutia on Viti Levu, Fiji’s main island, half the respondents to a survey had not heard of climate change (Lata and Nuun 2012). Even where there is awareness many believe that it is a problem caused by developed countries and should therefore be solved by developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Climatic Change: Adapting to climate change in small island developing states|last=Betzold|first=Carola|publisher=Springer Netherlands|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments have considered various approaches to reduce migration compelled by environmental conditions in at-risk communities, including programs of social protection, livelihoods development, basic urban infrastructure development, and disaster risk management.  Some experts even support migration as an appropriate way for people to cope with environmental changes.  However, this is controversial because migrants – particularly low-skilled ones – are among the most vulnerable people in society and are often denied basic protections and access to services.&lt;ref name="beta.adb.org"/&gt;

Climate change is only one factor that may contribute to a household's decision to migrate; other factors may include [[poverty]], [[population growth]] or [[employment]] options.&lt;ref&gt;Bogumil Terminski, Environmentally-Induced Displacement. Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges, CEDEM, [[University of Liège]], 2012&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, it is difficult to classify [[environmental migrant]]s as actual "refugees" as legally defined by the [[UNHCR]].&lt;ref name= "UNHCR on environmental migration terminology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/research/RESEARCH/3ae6a0d00.pdf|title=UNHCR – Environmental refugees: myth or reality?, Richard Black|work=UNHCR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the [[UN Framework Convention on Climate Change]] nor its [[Kyoto Protocol]], an international agreement on climate change, includes any provisions concerning specific assistance or protection for those who will be directly affected by climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Elizabeth |last=Ferris |title=Making Sense of Climate Change, Natural Disasters, and Displacement: A Work in Progress |date=14 December 2007 |work=[[Brookings Institution]] |url=http://www.brookings.edu/speeches/2007/1214_climate_change_ferris.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606095750/http://www.brookings.edu/speeches/2007/1214_climate_change_ferris.aspx |archivedate=6 June 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In small islands and [[river delta|megadeltas]], [[inundation]] as a result of [[sea level rise]] is expected to threaten vital infrastructure and human settlements.&lt;ref&gt;

Harrod and Martin, Debra L. The Bioarchaeology of Climate Change and Violence. New York: Springer, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of experts have warned that climate change may lead to increased conflict.  The [[Military Advisory Board]], a panel of retired U.S. generals and admirals, predicted that global warming will serve as a "threat multiplier" in already volatile regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://securityandclimate.cna.org/report/ "National Security and the Threat of Climate Change]". [[Military Advisory Board]], April 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]] and the [[Center for a New American Security]], two Washington think tanks, have reported that flooding "has the potential to challenge regional and even national identities," leading to "armed conflict over resources."  They indicate that the greatest threat would come from "large-scale migrations of people — both inside nations and across existing national borders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Kurt M.

The link between climate change and security is a concern for authorities across the world, including [[United Nations Security Council]] and the [[Group of 77|G77]] group of developing nations.  Climate change's impact as a security threat is expected to hit developing nations particularly hard. In Britain, [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Margaret Beckett]] has argued that "An unstable climate will exacerbate some of the core drivers of conflict, such as migratory pressures and competition for resources."&lt;ref&gt;Reuters. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/18/world/18nations.html?ex=1334548800en=599119af2640e7b1ei=5088partner=rssnytemc=rss U.N. Council Hits Impasse Over Debate on Warming]. The New York Times, April 17, 2007. Retrieved on May 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
The links between the human impact of climate change and the threat of violence and armed conflict are particularly important because multiple destabilizing conditions are affected simultaneously.

Experts have suggested links to climate change in several major conflicts:

==Social impacts==
{{See also|Climate change and poverty|Climate change and gender}}

The consequences of [[climate change and poverty]] are not distributed uniformly within communities. Individual and social factors such as gender, age, education, ethnicity, geography and language lead to differential [[vulnerability]] and capacity to adapt to the effects of climate change. Climate change effects such as hunger, poverty and diseases like diarrhea and malaria, disproportionately impact children; about 90 percent of malaria and diarrhea deaths are among young children. Children are also 14–44 percent more likely to die from environmental factors,&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956247808096125]&lt;/ref&gt; again leaving them the most vulnerable.

The American ''Insurance Journal'' predicted that "catastrophe losses should be expected to double roughly every 10 years because of increases in construction costs, increases in the number of structures and changes in their characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;Insurance Journal: [http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2006/04/18/67389.htm Sound Risk Management, Strong Investment Results Prove Positive for P/C Industry], April 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Association of British Insurers has stated that limiting carbon emissions would avoid 80% of the projected additional annual cost of tropical cyclones by the 2080s. The cost is also increasing partly because of building in exposed areas such as coasts and floodplains. The ABI claims that reduction of the vulnerability to some inevitable effects of climate change, for example through more resilient buildings and improved flood defences, could also result in considerable cost-savings in the longterm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/Child/552/Financial_Risks_of_Climate_Change.pdf |title=Financial risks of climate change |publisher=Association of British Insurers |date=June 2005 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605171753/https://www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/Child/552/Financial_Risks_of_Climate_Change.pdf |archivedate=5 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human settlement==
{{Further|Sea level rise|Future sea level}}

A major challenge for human settlements is [[sea level rise]], indicated by ongoing observation and research of rapid declines in ice-mass balance from both Greenland and Antarctica. Estimates for 2100 are at least twice as large as previously estimated by IPCC AR4, with an upper limit of about two meters.&lt;ref name="Copenhagen Diagnosis"&gt;

===Coasts and low-lying areas===

For historical reasons to do with [[trade]], many of the world's largest and most prosperous cities are on the [[coast]]. In developing countries, the poorest often live on [[floodplain]]s, because it is the only available space, or fertile agricultural land. These settlements often lack infrastructure such as [[Levee|dyke]]s and early warning systems. Poorer communities also tend to lack the insurance, savings, or access to credit needed to recover from disasters.

In a journal paper, Nicholls and [[Richard Tol|Tol]] (2006) considered the effects of sea level rise:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|year=2006|title=Impacts and responses to sea-level rise: a global analysis of the SRES scenarios over the twenty-first century

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most vulnerable future worlds to sea-level rise appear to be the A2 and B2 [IPCC] [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios|scenarios]], which primarily reflects differences in the [[socio-economic]] situation (coastal population, [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) and GDP/capita), rather than the magnitude of sea-level rise. Small islands and deltaic settings stand out as being more vulnerable as shown in many earlier analyses. Collectively, these results suggest that human societies will have more choice in how they respond to sea-level rise than is often assumed. However, this conclusion needs to be tempered by recognition that we still do not understand these choices and significant impacts remain possible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The IPCC reported that socioeconomic impacts of climate change in coastal and low-lying areas would be overwhelmingly adverse. The following impacts were projected with very high confidence:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
*Coastal and low-lying areas would be exposed to increasing risks including coastal erosion due to climate change and sea level rise.
*By the 2080s, millions of people would experience floods every year due to sea level rise. The numbers affected were projected to be largest in the densely populated and low-lying mega-deltas of Asia and Africa; and smaller islands were judged to be especially vulnerable.

A study in the April 2007 issue of ''Environment and Urbanization'' reports that 634 million people live in coastal areas within 30 feet (9.1 m) of sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;  The study also reported that about two thirds of the world's cities with over five million people are located in these low-lying coastal areas.

== Energy sector ==

=== Oil, coal and natural gas ===
Oil and natural gas infrastructure is vulnerable to the effects of climate change and the increased risk{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} of disasters such as [[storm]], [[cyclone]]s, [[flooding]] and long-term [[Sea level rise|increases in sea level]]. Minimising these risks by building in less disaster prone areas, can be expensive and impossible in countries with coastal locations or [[island state]]s. All [[thermal power station]]s depend on water to cool them.  Not only is there increased demand for fresh water, but climate change can increase the likelihood of [[drought]] and [[Water shortage|fresh water shortages]]. Another impact for thermal power plants, is that increasing the temperatures in which they operate reduces their efficiency and hence their output. The source of oil often comes from areas prone to high natural disaster risks; such as tropical storms, hurricanes, cyclones, and floods. An example is [[Hurricane Katrina]]'s impact on oil extraction in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], as it destroyed 126 oil and gas platforms and damaged 183 more.&lt;ref name=ODI1&gt;Dr. Frauke Urban and Dr. Tom Mitchell 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation Climate change, disasters and electricity generation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920024704/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5792&amp;title=climate-change-disasters-electricity-generation |date=20 September 2012 }}. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]] and [[Institute of Development Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, previously pristine arctic areas will now be available for [[Oil spill|resource extraction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2012/09/120910-shell-begins-arctic-drilling/|title=Ice-Breaking: U.S. Oil Drilling Starts as Nations Mull the Changed Arctic.|work=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nuclear ===
Climate change, along with extreme weather and natural disasters can affect nuclear power plants in a similar way to those using oil, coal, and natural gas. However, the impact of water shortages on nuclear power plants cooled by rivers will be greater than on other thermal power plants.  This is because old reactor designs with water-cooled cores must run at lower internal temperatures and thus, paradoxically, must dump more heat to the environment to produce a given amount of electricity. This situation has forced some nuclear reactors to be shut down and will do so again unless the cooling systems of these plants are enhanced to provide more capacity.  Nuclear power supply was diminished by low river ﬂow rates and droughts, which meant rivers had reached the maximum temperatures for cooling. Such shutdowns happened in France during the 2003 and 2006 heat waves.  During the heat waves, 17 reactors had to limit output or shut down. 77% of French electricity is produced by nuclear power; and in 2009 a similar situation created a 8GW shortage, and forced the French government to import electricity. Other Cases have been reported from Germany, where extreme temperatures have reduced nuclear power production 9 times due to high temperatures between 1979 and 2007. In particular: 
* The [[Unterweser Nuclear Power Plant|Unterweser nuclear power plant]] reduced output by 90% between June and September 2003.
* The [[Isar Nuclear Power Plant|Isar nuclear power plant]] cut production by 60% for 14 days due to excess river temperatures and low stream ﬂow in the river Isar in 2006.
Similar events have happened elsewhere in Europe during those same hot summers. Many scientists agree that if [[global warming]] continues, this disruption is likely to increase.&lt;ref name=ODI1/&gt;

=== Hydroelectricity ===
Changes in the amount of river flow will correlate with the amount of energy produced by a dam. Lower river flows because of drought, climate change, or upstream dams and diversions, will reduce the amount of live storage in a reservoir; therefore reducing the amount of water that can be used for hydroelectricity. The result of diminished river flow can be a power shortage in areas that depend heavily on hydroelectric power. The risk of flow shortage may increase as a result of [[climate change]]. Studies from the [[Colorado River]] in the United States suggests that modest climate changes (such as a 2 degree change in Celsius that could result in a 10% decline in precipitation), might reduce river run-off by up to 40%. [[Brazil]] in particular, is vulnerable due to its having reliance on hydroelectricity as increasing temperatures, lower water ﬂow, and alterations in the rainfall regime, could reduce total energy production by 7% annually by the end of the century.&lt;ref name=ODI1 /&gt;

===Insurance===
An industry directly affected by the risks of climate change is the [[insurance]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaisonline.com/viewpoint/AAISviewpointSp05.pdf Viewpoint] American Association of Insurance Services&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2005 report from the Association of British Insurers, limiting carbon emissions could avoid 80% of the projected additional annual cost of tropical cyclones by the 2080s.&lt;ref&gt;Association of British Insurers (2005) [http://www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/Child/552/Financial_Risks_of_Climate_Change.pdf "Financial Risks of Climate Change"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605171753/https://www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/Child/552/Financial_Risks_of_Climate_Change.pdf |date=5 June 2013 }} summary report&lt;/ref&gt; A June 2004 report by the Association of British Insurers declared "Climate change is not a remote issue for future generations to deal with; it is, in various forms here already, impacting on insurers' businesses now."&lt;ref&gt;Association of British Insurers (June 2005) [http://www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/364/SP_Climate_Change5.pdf "A Changing Climate for Insurance:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320104126/http://www.abi.org.uk/Display/File/364/SP_Climate_Change5.pdf |date=20 March 2009 }} A Summary Report for Chief Executives and Policymakers"&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted that weather-related risks for households and property were already increasing by 2–4% per year due to the changing weather conditions, and claims for storm and flood damages in the UK had doubled to over £6 billion over the period from 1998–2003 compared to the previous five years. The results are rising insurance premiums, and the risk that in some areas [[flood insurance]] will become unaffordable for those in the lower income brackets.

Financial institutions, including the world's two largest insurance companies: [[Munich Re]] and [[Swiss Re]], warned in a 2002 study that "the increasing frequency of severe climatic events, coupled with social trends could cost almost 150 billion [[United States dollar|US$]] each year in the next decade".&lt;ref&gt;UNEP (2002) [http://www.unepfi.org/fileadmin/documents/CEO_briefing_climate_change_2002_en.pdf "Key findings of UNEP’s Finance Initiatives study"] ''CEObriefing''&lt;/ref&gt; These costs would burden customers, taxpayers, and the insurance industry, with increased costs related to insurance and disaster relief.

In the United States, insurance losses have also greatly increased. It has been shown that a 1% climb in annual precipitation can increase catastrophe loss by as much as 2.8%.&lt;ref name="choifisher"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Choi |first1=O. |author2=A.

==Transport==
Roads, airport runways, railway lines and pipelines, (including [[oil pipeline]]s, [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, [[water main]]s etc.) may require increased maintenance and renewal as they become subject to greater temperature variation. Regions already adversely affected include areas of [[permafrost]], which are subject to high levels of [[subsidence]], resulting in buckling roads, sunken foundations, and severely cracked runways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airportbusiness.com/article/article.jsp?id=2258&amp;siteSection=4 Studies Show Climate Change Melting Permafrost Under Runways in Western Arctic] ''Weber, Bob Airportbusiness.com'' October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exercise intolerance''' is a condition of inability or decreased ability to perform [[physical exercise]] at what would be considered to be the normally expected level or duration. It also includes experiences of unusually severe post-exercise [[pain]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]] or other negative effects. Exercise intolerance is not a [[disease]] or [[syndrome]] in and of itself, but can result from various disorders.

In most cases, the specific reason that exercise is not tolerated is of considerable significance when trying to isolate the cause down to a specific disease. Dysfunctions involving the pulmonary, cardiovascular or neuromuscular systems have been frequently found to be associated with exercise intolerance, with behavioural causes also playing a part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/content/21/1/6.extract|title = Exercise Intolerance|date = 2000|accessdate = 2015-04-17|journal = Pediatrics in Review|volume = 21|issue = 1|pages = 6–9|last = Scott Owens|first = Bernard Gutin|doi = 10.1542/pir.21-1-6|pmid = 10617757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

===Respiratory disorders===
*[[Cystic fibrosis]]: CF can cause skeletal muscle atrophy, however more commonly it can cause exercise intolerance. The exercise intolerance is associated with reduced pulmonary function that is the origin of CF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Infection, inflammation and exercise in cystic fibrosis|last = Van de Weert-van Leeuwen|first = Pauline|date = 2013|journal =Respiratory Research|doi = 10.1186/1465-9921-14-32|pmid = 23497303|pmc=3599254|volume=14|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bronchiectasis]]

===Chronic fatigue syndrome===
* [[Orthostatic intolerance]] (OI) occurs in CFS. OI includes exercise intolerance as one of the main symptoms. It also includes fatigue, nausea, headaches, cognitive problems and visual disturbances as other less major symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Predictors of post-infectious chronic fatigue syndrome in adolescents|last = Leonard|first = Jason|date = 2014-01-01|journal = Health Psychology and Behavioural Medicine|doi = 10.1080/21642850.2013.869176|pmid = 24660116|pmc=3956649|volume=2|issue = 1|pages=41–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-concussion syndrome===
* Exercise intolerance is present in those with PCS however their intolerance to exercise may reduce over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Exercise Intolerance in Individuals With Postconcussion Syndrome|last = Kozlowski|first = Karl F.|date = 2013|journal = Journal of Athletic Training|doi = 10.4085/1062-6050-48.5.02|pmid = 23952041|pmc=3784364|volume=48|issue = 5|pages=627–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Individuals with [[postconcussion syndrome]] may also experience a level of exercise intolerance, however there is little known comparatively about exercise intolerance in PCS patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Exercise Intolerance in Individuals With Postconcussion Syndrome|last = Kozlowski|first = Karl F|date = 2013|journal = Journal of Athletic Training|doi = 10.4085/1062-6050-48.5.02|pmid = 23952041|first2 = James|last2 = Graham|issue = 5|volume = 48|pages = 627–635|pmc=3784364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musculoskeletal disorders===

===Mutations===
*[[Mitochondrial complex 111]]: Currently it is suggested that there are 27 different mutations identified in cytochrome ''b ''(mitochondrial complex III is one of those mutations). This mutation can often lead to skeletal muscle weakness and as a result exercise intolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mitochondrial Complex III Deficiency Associated with a Homozygous Mutation in UQCRQ|last = Barel|first = Ortal|date = 2008|journal = The American Journal of Human Genetics|doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.03.020|pmid = 18439546|pmc=2427202|volume=82|issue = 5|pages=1211–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[a complex of Coenzyme Q10]]:
*[[Skeletal muscle respiratory chain defect]]: This can result in severe  exercise intolerance which is manifested by the following symptoms of Skeletal muscle respiratory chain defect; muscle fatigue and lactic acidosis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Exercise intolerance, lactic acidosis, and abnormal cardiopulmonary regulation in exercise associated with adult skeletal muscle cytochrome c oxidase deficiency|last = Haller|first = R.G|date = 1989|journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation|doi = 10.1172/JCI114135|pmid = 2544623|pmc=303965|volume=84|issue = 1|pages=155–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exercise tolerance reflects the combined capacity of components in the oxygen cascade to supply adequate oxygen for ATP resynthesis. In individuals with diseases such as cancer, certain therapies can affect one or more components of this cascade and therefore reduce the body's ability to utilise or deliver oxygen, leading to exercise intolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70031-2|pmid=19482248|title=Exercise intolerance in cancer and the role of exercise therapy to reverse dysfunction|journal=The Lancet Oncology|volume=10|issue=6|pages=598–605|year=2009|last1=Jones|first1=Lee W.|last2=Eves|first2=Neil D.|last3=Haykowsky|first3=Mark|last4=Freedland|first4=Stephen J.|last5=MacKey|first5=John R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cytochrome b mutations ===
[[Cytochrome b]] mutations can frequently cause isolated exercise intolerance and myopathy and in some cases multisystem disorders. The mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III catalyses electron transfer to cytochrome c. Complex III is embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondria and consists of 11 subunits. Cytochrome b is encoded by the mitochondrial DNA which differs from all other subunits which are encoded in the nucleus. Cytochrome b plays a major part in the correct fabricating and function of complex III.

This mutation occurred in an 18-year-old man who had experienced exercise intolerance for most of his adolescence. Symptoms included extreme fatigue, nausea, a decline in physical activity ability and myalgia.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===Intracranial hypertension===
Individuals with elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid can experience increased head pain, throbbing, pulsatile tinnitus, nausea and vomiting, faintness and weakness and even loss of consciousness after exercise or exertion.

== Treatment ==
Exercise is key for many heart and back patients, and a variety of specific exercise techniques are available for both groups. Some exercise specialists are trained in modifications specific to these patients{{Who|date=August 2009}}.

In individuals with [[heart failure]] and normal [[Ejection fraction|EF (ejection fraction)]], including aortic distensibility, blood pressure, LV diastolic compliance and skeletal muscle function, aerobic exercise has the potential to improve exercise tolerance. A variety of pharmacological interventions such as [[verapamil]], [[enalapril]], angiotensin receptor antagonism, and aldosterone antagonism could potentially improve exercise tolerance in these individuals as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Exercise Intolerance|last = Kitzman|first = Delane W|date = 2005|journal = Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases|doi = 10.1016/j.pcad.2005.02.002|pmid = 16115516|issue = 6|volume = 47|pages = 367–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on individuals suffering from [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)]], has found a number of effective therapies in relation to exercise intolerance. These include:
# [[Oxygen supplementation|Oxygen Supplementation]]
#* Reduces carotid body drive and slows respiration at a given level of exercise.
# Treatment with [[bronchodilators]]
#* Clinically useful improvements in expiratory airflow, allows fuller exhalation in a given period of time, reduces dynamic hyperinflation, and prolongs exercise tolerance.
# [[Heliox]] (79% Helium, 21% oxygen)
#* Heliox has a lower density than air.
#* Breathing heliox lowers expiratory airflow resistance, decreases dynamic hyperinflation, and prolongs exercise tolerance.
# High intensity rehabilitative exercise training
#* Increasing the fitness of muscles decreases the amount of lactic acid released at any given level of exercise.
#* Since lactic acid stimulates respiration, after rehabilitative training exercising, ventilation is lower, respiration is slowed, and dynamic hyperinflation is reduced.
A combination of these therapies (Combined therapies), have shown the potential to improve exercise tolerance as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Combination therapy for exercise intolerance in COPD|last = Casaburi|first = R|date = 2006|journal = Thorax|doi = 10.1136/thx.2006.058511|pmid = 16807386|issue = 7|volume = 61|pages = 551–552|pmc = 2104677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hazards===
Certain conditions exist where exercise may be [[contraindicated]] or should be performed under the direction of an experienced and licensed medical professional acting within his or her scope of practice. These conditions include:

*Decompensated [[heart failure]]
*Recent [[myocardial infarction]]
*[[Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] or [[cardiomyopathy]] from recent [[myocarditis]]
*Active or suspected myocarditis or [[pericarditis]]
*Low left ventricular [[ejection fraction]]
*Severe [[aortic stenosis]]
*Unstable [[ischemia]]
*Unstable [[arrythmia]]
*Irregular or [[resting pulse]] greater than 100 bpm
*Resting [[systolic blood pressure]] &gt;200&amp;nbsp;mm Hg or resting [[diastolic blood pressure]] &gt;110&amp;nbsp;mm Hg
*Severe [[pulmonary hypertension]]
*Severe [[chronic fatigue syndrome]]
*Suspected or known [[dissecting aortic aneurysm]]
*Recent systemic or [[pulmonary embolus]]
*[[Pneumothorax]] and [[haemoptysis]]
*[[thrombophlebitis]]

The above list does not include all potential contraindications or precautions to exercise.
Although it has not been shown to promote improved muscle strength, passive range-of-motion exercise is sometimes used to prevent skin breakdown and prevent contractures in patients unable to safely self-power.

To date at least twenty five different genes have been implicated in causing [[GnRH]] deficiency conditions such  [[Kallmann syndrome]] (KS) or other forms of [[hypogonadotropic hypogonadism]] through a disruption in the production or activity of GnRH. These genes involved cover all forms of [[inheritance]] and no one gene defect has been shown to be common to all cases which makes genetic testing and inheritance prediction difficult.&lt;ref name="pmid:23650337"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Layman L. |title=Clinical Testing for Kallmann Syndrome. |journal=J Clin Endocrinol Metab |volume=98 |issue=5 |pages=1860–1862 |year=2013 |pmid=23650337 |doi=10.1210/jc.2013-1624 |pmc=3644595}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid:25071724"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Valdes-Socin H, Rubio Almanza M, Tomé Fernández-Ladreda M, Debray FG, Bours V, Beckers A |title=Reproduction, smell, and neurodevelopmental disorders: genetic defects in different hypogonadotropic hypogonadal syndromes. |journal=Front Endocrinol (Lausanne) |volume=5 |issue=109 |pages= 109|year=2014 |pmc=4088923 |doi=10.3389/fendo.2014.00109 |pmid=25071724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Holyoke Water Works (HWW)''', sometimes referred to as the '''Holyoke Reservoir System''', is a public [[drinking water]] utility and [[municipal service]] agency of the City of {{w|Holyoke, Massachusetts}}, which provides clean drinking water to that city. Founded in 1872 by an act of {{w|Massachusetts General Court}}, the system was developed as a series of reservoirs to serve the growing city's residents and industry at the end of the 19th century. Today its primary drinking water source is the Tighe-Carmody Reservoir in [[Southampton, Massachusetts]], while it maintains reserve drinking water supplies at the [[Ashley Reservoir|Ashley]] and the [[Whiting Street Reservoir]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709175102/http://www.pvpc.org/sites/default/files/Holyoke_HMP_Update_2016.pdf|archive-date=2018-07-09|url=http://www.pvpc.org/sites/default/files/Holyoke_HMP_Update_2016.pdf|publisher=Pioneer Valley Planning Commission|author=The Holyoke Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee|title=City of Holyoke, Natural Hazards Mitigation Plan Update}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medicine, the '''hygiene hypothesis''' states a lack of early childhood exposure to [[infectious agents]], [[symbiotic]] microorganisms (such as the [[gut flora]] or [[probiotic]]s), and [[parasite]]s increases susceptibility to [[allergy|allergic]] diseases by suppressing the natural development of the [[immune system]]. In particular, the lack of exposure is thought to lead to defects in the establishment of [[immune tolerance]].

The hygiene hypothesis has also been called the "[[biome]] depletion theory" and the "lost friends theory".&lt;ref name=parker&gt;{{cite web| url=http://evmedreview.com/?p=457/ |author=William Parker |title=Reconstituting the depleted biome to prevent immune disorders|publisher=The Evolution &amp; Medicine Review |date=2010-10-13| accessdate=2014-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The original formulation of the hygiene hypothesis dates from 1989 when David Strachan proposed that lower incidence of [[infection]] in early childhood could be an explanation for the rapid 20th century rise in allergic diseases such as [[asthma]] and [[hay fever]].&lt;ref name=strachan2000&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Strachan | first1 = D. | title = Family size, infection and atopy: The first decade of the 'hygiene hypothesis' | doi = 10.1136/thorax.55.suppl_1.S2 | journal = Thorax | volume = 55 | issue = 90001 | pages = S2–S10 | year = 2000 | pmid =  | pmc = 1765943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now also recognised that the "reduced microbial exposure" concept applies to a much broader range of [[chronic inflammatory disease]]s than asthma and hay fever, which includes diseases such as [[type 1 diabetes]]&lt;ref name=stene2001&gt;Stene LC, Nafstad P. Relation between occurrence of type 1 diabetes and asthma" ''Lancet'' 2001;357:607&lt;/ref&gt; and multiple sclerosis,&lt;ref name=raison2010&gt;Raison CL, Lowry CA, Rook GAW.

In 2003 Graham Rook proposed the "old friends hypothesis" which some claim offers a more rational explanation for the link between microbial exposure and inflammatory disorders.&lt;ref name=rook2003&gt;Rook GA, Martinelli R, Brunet LR. Innate immune responses to mycobacteria and the downregulation of atopic responses" ''Curr Opin Allergy Clin Immunol'' 2003 Oct;3(5) 337-42.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the vital microbial exposures are not colds, influenza, measles and other common childhood infections which have evolved relatively recently over the last 10,000 years, but rather the microbes already present during mammalian and human evolution, that could persist in small hunter gatherer groups as microbiota, tolerated latent infections or carrier states. He proposes that humans have become so dependent on these "old friends" that their immune systems neither develop properly nor function properly without them.

Strachan's original formulation of the hygiene hypothesis also centred around the idea that smaller families provided insufficient microbial exposure partly because of less person-to-person spread of infections, but also because of "improved household amenities and higher standards of personal cleanliness".&lt;ref name=strachan2000 /&gt; It seems likely that this was the reason he named it the "hygiene hypothesis". Although the "hygiene revolution" of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries may have been a major factor, it now seems more likely that, although public health measures such as [[sanitation]], [[potable water]] and [[garbage collection]] were instrumental in reducing our exposure to [[cholera]], [[typhoid]] and so on, they also deprived people of their exposure to the "old friends" that occupy the same environmental habitats.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith&gt;{{cite web |authors=Stanwell-Smith R, Bloomfield SF, Rook GA. |title=The hygiene hypothesis and its implications for home hygiene, lifestyle and public health. |publisher=International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene. |url=http://www.ifh-homehygiene.org/best-practice-review/hygiene-hypothesis-and-its-implications-home-hygiene-lifestyle-and-public-0 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomfield &gt;Bloomfield SF, Stanwell-Smith R, Rook GA.

The rise of [[autoimmune disease]]s and [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] in young people in the developed world was linked to the hygiene hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = M.

== History ==

=== Hygiene ===

Although the idea that exposure to certain infections may decrease the risk of allergy is not new, Strachan was one of the first to formally propose it, in an article published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.299.6710.1259 |title=Hay fever, hygiene, and household size |year=1989 |last1=Strachan |first1=D. P. |journal=BMJ |volume=299 |issue=6710 |pages=1259–60 |pmid=2513902 |pmc=1838109}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article proposed to explain the observation that [[hay fever]] and [[eczema]], both allergic diseases, were less common in children from larger families, which were presumably exposed to more infectious agents through their siblings, than in children from families with only one child.

The hypothesis was extensively investigated by [[immunology|immunologists]] and [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] and has become an important theoretical framework for the study of chronic inflammatory disorders. It explains the increase in allergic diseases that has been seen since industrialization and the higher incidence of allergic diseases in more developed countries. Epidemiological studies continue to confirm the protective effect of large family size and of growing up on a farm. However, exposure to common childhood infections such as chickenpox or measles is not thought to be protective.

=== Old friends ===

The "old friends hypothesis" proposed in 2003&lt;ref name=rook2003/&gt; may offer a better explanation for the link between microbial exposure and inflammatory diseases.&lt;ref name=rook2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=rook2003/&gt; This hypothesis argues that the vital exposures are not common childhood and other recently evolved infections, which are no older than 10,000 years, but rather microbes already present in hunter-gatherer times when the human immune system was evolving. Conventional childhood infections are mostly "[[crowd infections]]" that kill or immunise and thus cannot persist in isolated hunter-gatherer groups. Crowd infections started to appear after the [[neolithic agriculture|neolithic agricultural]] revolution, when human populations increased in size and proximity. The microbes that co-evolved with mammalian immune systems are much more ancient. According to this hypothesis, humans became so dependent on them that their immune systems can neither develop nor function properly without them.

Rook proposed that these microbes most likely include:

* Ambient species that exist in the same environments as humans
* Species that inhabit human skin, gut and respiratory tract, and that of the animals we live with
* Organisms such as [[virus]]es and [[helminth]]s (worms) that establish chronic infections or carrier states that humans can tolerate and so could co-evolve a specific immunoregulatory relationship with the immune system.

The modified hypothesis later expanded to include exposure to [[symbiotic]] bacteria and parasites.&lt;ref name=grammatikos2008&gt;{{cite journal | author = Grammatikos Alexandros P | year = 2008 | title = The genetic and environmental basis of atopic diseases | url = | journal = Annals of Medicine | volume = 40 | issue = 7| pages = 482–95 | doi = 10.1080/07853890802082096 | pmid = 18608118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Evolution turns the inevitable into a necessity." This means that the majority of mammalian evolution took place in mud and rotting vegetation and more than 90 percent of human evolution took place in isolated hunter-gatherer communities and farming communities. Therefore, the human immune systems have evolved to anticipate certain types of microbial input, making the inevitable exposure into a necessity. The organisms that are implicated in the hygiene hypothesis are not proven to cause the disease prevalence, however there are sufficient data on lactobacilli, saprophytic environment mycobacteria, and helminths and their association. These bacteria and parasites have commonly been found in vegetation, mud, and water throughout evolution.&lt;ref name=rook2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=rook2003/&gt;

Multiple possible mechanisms have been proposed for how the 'Old Friends' microorganisms prevent autoimmune diseases and asthma.  They include: 
# Reciprocal inhibition between immune responses directed against distinct antigens of the Old Friends microbes which elicit stronger immune responses than the weaker autoantigens and allergens of autoimmune disease and allergy respectively.
# Competition for cytokines, MHC receptors and growth factors needed by the immune system to mount an immune response.
# Immunoregulatory interactions with host TLRs.&lt;ref name=Okada2010/&gt;

=== Microbial diversity ===

The "microbial diversity" hypothesis, proposed by Paolo Matricardi&lt;ref name=matricardi2010&gt;{{cite journal | author = Matricardi PM | year = 2010 | title = 99th Dahlem conference on infection, inflammation and chronic inflammatory disorders: controversial aspects of the 'hygiene hypothesis' | url = | journal = Clin Exp Immunol | volume = 160 | issue = 1| pages = 98–105 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04130.x| pmid = 20415858 | pmc = 2841842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed by von Hertzen,&lt;ref name=vonhertzen2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=von Hertzen L, Hanski I, Haahtela T | year = 2011 | title = Natural immunity. Biodiversity loss and inflammatory diseases are two global megatrends that might be related | doi = 10.1038/embor.2011.195 | journal = EMBO Rep | volume = 12 | issue = 11| pages = 1089–1093 | pmc = 3207110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; holds that diversity and turnover of bacterial species in the [[gut mucosa]] and other sites is a key factor for priming and regulating the immune system, rather than stable colonization with a particular species. It is not clear whether diversity per se, or that a diverse population will include certain organisms without which the immune system fails to develop. Rook likened the embryonic immune system to a computer that contains programmes but little data. During gestation and infancy exposure to diverse organisms builds a "database" that allows the immune system to identify and respond to harmful agents and normalize once the danger is eliminated.

For allergic disease, the most important times for exposure are: early in development; later during pregnancy; and the first few days or months of infancy. Exposure needs to be maintained over a significant period. This fits with evidence that delivery by [[Caesarean section]] may be associated with increased allergies, whilst breastfeeding can be protective.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith /&gt; The extent to which exposures need to be maintained after infancy and whether these conditions could be managed by on-going exposure is as yet unknown.

== Evolution of the adaptive immune system ==

Humans and the microbes they harbor have co-evolved for thousands of centuries; however, it is thought that the human species has gone through numerous phases in history characterized by different pathogen exposures.  For instance, in very early human societies, small interaction between its members has given particular selection to a relatively limited group of pathogens that had high transmission rates.  When societies became larger, the introduction of agriculture some 10,000 years ago made the spreading of new pathogens more likely, and thus exposures to pathogens that favored high population densities to thrive.  Furthermore, pastoralism has made zoonotic pathogen transmissions even more favorable.  It is considered that the human immune system is likely subjected to a selective pressure from pathogens that are responsible for down regulating certain alleles and therefore phenotypes in humans, the thalassemia genes that are shaped by the ''Plasmodium'' species expressing the selection pressure being a model for this theory.

Recent comparative genomic studies have shown that immune response genes (protein coding and non-coding regulatory genes) have less evolutionary constraint, and are rather more frequently targeted by positive selection from pathogens that coevolve with the human subject.  Of all the various types of pathogens known to cause disease in humans, helminths warrant special attention, because of their ability to modify the prevalence or severity of certain immune-related responses in human and mouse models.  In fact recent research has shown that parasitic worms have served as a stronger selective pressure on select human genes encoding interleukins and interleukin receptors when compared to viral and bacterial pathogens.  Helminths are thought to have been as old as the [[adaptive immune system]], suggesting that they may have co-evolved, also implying that our immune system has been strongly focused on fighting off helminthic infections, insofar as to potentially interact with them early in infancy.

== Biological basis ==

Allergic conditions are caused by inappropriate immunological responses to harmless [[antigens]] driven by a [[t helper cell|T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2]]-mediated immune response, T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cells produce [[interleukin 4]], [[interleukin 5]], [[interleukin 6]], [[interleukin 13]] and predominantly [[immunoglobulin E]].&lt;ref name=Okada2010/&gt; Many [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es elicit a [[t helper cell|T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1]]-mediated immune response, which down-regulates T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 responses. T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 immune responses are characterized by the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as [[interleukin 2]], [[IFNγ]], and [[TNFα]]. Factors that favor a predominantly T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 phenotype include: older siblings, large family size, early day care attendance, infection (TB, measles, or hepatitis), rural living, or contact with animals. A T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2-dominated phenotype is associated with high antibiotic use, western lifestyle, urban environment, diet, and sensitivity to dust mites and cockroaches. T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 and T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 responses are reciprocally inhibitory, so when one is active, the other is suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kramer| year = 2013 | title = Maintaining Health by Balancing Microbial Exposure and Prevention of Infection: the Hygiene Hypothesis versus the Hypothesis of Early Immune Challenge | url = | journal = Journal of Hospital Infection | volume = 83 | issue = | page = 51 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism of action of the hygiene hypothesis was insufficient stimulation of the T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 arm, stimulating the cell defence of the immune system and leading to an overactive mother T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 arm, stimulating the antibody-mediated immunity of the immune systems, which in turn led to allergic disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0167-5699(00)01582-6 |title=Do common childhood infections 'teach' the immune system not to be allergic? |year=2000 |last1=Folkerts |first1=Gert |last2=Walzl |first2=Gerhard |last3=Openshaw |first3=Peter J.M. |journal=Immunology Today |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=118–20 |pmid=10777250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This explanation however, cannot explain the rise in incidence (similar to the rise of allergic diseases) of several T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1-mediated [[autoimmunity|autoimmune diseases]], including [[inflammatory bowel disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type I diabetes]]. [Figure 1Bach] However, the North South Gradient seen in the prevalence of multiple sclerosis has been found to be inversely related to the global distribution of parasitic infection.[Figure 2Bach] Additionally, research has shown that MS patients infected with parasites displayed T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 type immune responses as opposed to the proinflammatory T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 immune phenotype seen in non-infected multiple sclerosis patients.[Fleming] Parasite infection has also been shown to improve inflammatory bowel disease and may act in a similar fashion as it does in multiple sclerosis.[Lee]

An alternative explanation is that the developing immune system must receive stimuli (from infectious agents, symbiotic bacteria, or parasites) to adequately develop [[regulatory T cell]]s. Without that stimuli it becomes more susceptible to autoimmune diseases and allergic diseases, because of insufficiently repressed T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 and T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 responses, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.iac.2005.03.005 |title=The Hygiene Hypothesis Revisited |year=2005 |last1=Bufford |first1=Jeremy D. |last2=Gern |first2=James E. |journal=Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=247–62, v–vi |pmid=15878454 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, all chronic inflammatory disorders show evidence of failed immunoregulation.&lt;ref name=rockgaw&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rook GAW | date = Apr 2010 | title = 99th Dahlem conference on infection, inflammation and chronic inflammatory disorders: darwinian medicine and the 'hygiene' or 'old friends' hypothesis | url = | journal = Clin Exp Immunol | volume = 160 | issue = 1| pages = 70–9 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04133.x| pmid = 20415854 | pmc = 2841838 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, helminths, non-pathogenic ambient pseudocommensal bacteria or certain gut [[commensal]]s and [[probiotics]], drive immunoregulation.

== Epidemiological evidence ==
{{medref|section|date=May 2016}}

The hygiene hypothesis is supported by epidemiological data. Studies have shown that various immunological and autoimmune diseases are much less common in the developing world than the industrialized world and that immigrants to the industrialized world from the developing world increasingly develop immunological disorders in relation to the length of time since arrival in the industrialized world.&lt;ref name=Okada2010/&gt; This is true for asthma&lt;ref name="pmid12910582"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ppul.10323 |title=Migration to a western country increases asthma symptoms but not eosinophilic airway inflammation |year=2003 |last1=Gibson |first1=Peter G. |last2=Henry |first2=Richard L. |last3=Shah |first3=Smita |last4=Powell |first4=Heather |last5=Wang |first5=He |journal=Pediatric Pulmonology |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=209–15 |pmid=12910582}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other chronic inflammatory disorders.&lt;ref name=rook2013 /&gt;

Recently, ''[[Opisthorchis felineus]]'' chronic helminthic infection in the endemic region of Russia was found to be associated with lower total [[serum cholesterol]] levels and a significant attenuation of [[atherosclerosis]] in humans.&lt;ref name=magen2013&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Magen Eli |author2=Bychkov Vitaly |author3=Ginovker Alexander |author4=Kashuba Eduard | year = 2013 | title = Chronic Opisthorchis felineus infection attenuates atherosclerosis – an autopsy study | url = | journal = International Journal for Parasitology | volume = 43 | issue = 10| pages = 819–24 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijpara.2013.04.008 | pmid = 23792298 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developed countries where childhood diseases were eliminated, the asthma rate for youth is approximately 10%. In the 19th century, hay-fever, an easily recognisable allergy, was a very rare condition.&lt;ref name=backley1873&gt;Blackley CH (1873) Experimental Researches on the Causes and Nature of Catarrhus Aestivus (Hay-fever and Hay-asthma) (Baillière Tindall and Cox, London).&lt;/ref&gt;

Longitudinal studies in Ghana demonstrate an increase in immunological disorders as it grew more affluent and presumably cleaner.&lt;ref name=pmid17326711&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040070 |title=Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm and Atopy in Ghana: Two Surveys Ten Years Apart |year=2007 |last1=Addo-Yobo |first1=Emmanuel O.

Antibiotic usage, which reduces the diversity of gut microbiota, is another cited factor. Although several studies have shown associations between antibiotic use and later development of asthma or allergy, other studies suggest that the effect is due to more frequent antibiotic use in asthmatic children. Trends in vaccine use may also be relevant, but epidemiological studies provide no consistent support for a detrimental effect of vaccination/immunization on [[atopy]] rates.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith /&gt; In support of the old friends hypothesis, the intestinal microbiome was found to differ between allergic and non-allergic Estonian and Swedish children (although this finding was not replicated in a larger cohort), and the biodiversity of the intestinal flora in patients with Crohn’s disease was diminished.&lt;ref name=Okada2010/&gt;

In 2015, a study found that washing dishes by hand as opposed to using a dishwasher, along with eating food directly from a farm or fermented food, might lead to reduced risk of certain conditions, including asthma, eczema, and possibly hay fever, though the data found on hay fever was not regarded as [[Statistical significant|statistically significant]]. It was stated, however, that more research was needed to determine if there was an [[Correlation does not imply causation|actual causal effect]] between these practices and a reduced risk of allergies and asthma.&lt;ref name="dishes"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-hand-washing-allergies-20150223-story.html|title=How hand-washing dishes may prevent kids from getting allergies|first=Deborah|last=Netburn|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=February 23, 2015|accessdate=February 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public health trends ==

Since allergies and other chronic inflammatory diseases are largely diseases of the last 100 years or so, the "hygiene" revolution of the last 200 years came under scrutiny as a possible cause. During the 1800s radical improvements to sanitation and water quality occurred in Europe and North America. The introduction of toilets and sewer systems and the cleanup of city streets, and cleaner food were part of this program. This in turn led to a rapid decline in infectious diseases, particularly during the period 1900-1950, through reduced exposure to infectious agents.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomfield /&gt;

Public health activities have also played a part in affecting diet and lifestyle, such as physical activity levels and locations.

It has been suggested that public awareness of the initial form of the "hygiene hypothesis" has led to an "increased disregard" for hygiene in the home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956713513003745 | doi=10.1016/j.foodcont.2013.07.026 | volume=35 | title=Hygiene in the home kitchen: Changes in behaviour and impact of key microbiological hazard control measures | journal=Food Control | pages=392–400| year=2014 | last1=Taché | first1=J. | last2=Carpentier | first2=B. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment ==

While no hygiene-related treatments are part of the standard of care, various approaches are under investigation. Helminth therapy is one alternative.&lt;ref name= fleming2011/&gt; [[Probiotic]]s (drinks or foods) have never been shown to reintroduce microbes to the gut. As yet, therapeutically relevant microbes have not been specifically identified.&lt;ref name=sanders2013&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sanders ME, Guarner F, Guerrant R, Holt PR, Quigley EM, Sartor RB, Sherman PM, Mayer EA | date = May 2013 | title = An update on the use and investigation of probiotics in health and disease | url = | journal = Gut | volume = 62 | issue = 5| pages = 787–96 | doi=10.1136/gutjnl-2012-302504| pmid = 23474420 | pmc = 4351195 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifestyle changes could increase microbial exposure, but whether this on balance improves the balance of risks remains the subject of research. Proposals include natural childbirth, sustained breast feeding and physical interaction between siblings, and encouraging children to spend more time in "uncleaned" outdoor environments.

Should these therapies become accepted, public policy implications include providing green spaces in urban areas or even providing access to agricultural environments for children.&lt;ref name="gaw in press"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rook GA | date = Oct 2013 | title = Regulation of the immune system by biodiversity from the natural environment: an ecosystem service essential to health | url = | journal = PNAS | volume =  110| issue = 46| pages =  18360–18367| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1313731110 | bibcode = 2013PNAS..11018360R| pmc = 3831972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-inflammatory effects of helminth infection are prompting interest and research into diseases that involve inflammation but that are not currently considered to include autoimmunity or immune dysregulation as a causative factor. Heart disease and arteriosclerosis both have similar epidemiological profiles as autoimmune diseases and both involve inflammation. Their increased incidence cannot be solely attributed to environmental factors. Recent research explored the eradication of helminths as contributing to this discrepancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2004.09.028 |title=Can worms defend our hearts? Chronic helminthic infections may attenuate the development of cardiovascular diseases |year=2005 |last1=Magen |first1=Eli |last2=Borkow |first2=Gadi |last3=Bentwich |first3=Zvi |last4=Mishal |first4=Joseph |last5=Scharf |first5=Shimon |journal=Medical Hypotheses |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=904–9 |pmid=15780483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cleanliness ==
No evidence supports the idea that reducing modern practices of cleanliness and hygiene would have any impact on rates of chronic inflammatory and allergic disorders, but a significant amount of evidence that it would increase the risks of infectious diseases.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith/&gt;

If home and personal cleanliness contributes to reduced exposure to vital microbes, its role is likely to be small. The idea that homes can be made “sterile” through excessive cleanliness is implausible. The evidence shows that, as fast as they are removed by cleaning, microbes are replaced, via dust and air from outdoors, by shedding from the body and other living things as well as from food.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith/&gt;&lt;ref name= Bloomfield /&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomfield2012&gt;Bloomfield SF. Exner M, Signorelli C, Nath KJ, Scott EA. 2012. The chain of infection transmission in the home and everyday life settings, and the role of hygiene in reducing the risk of infection.http://www.ifh-homehygiene.org/best-practice-review/chain-infection-transmission-home-and-everyday-life-settings-and-role-hygiene&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=isf&gt;Hygiene procedures in the home and their effectiveness: a review of the scientific evidence base (2008). International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene. http://www.ifh-homehygiene.org/best-practice-review/hygiene-procedures-home-and-their-effectiveness-review-scientific-evidence-base&lt;/ref&gt; The key point may be that the microbial content of urban housing has altered, not because of home and personal hygiene habits, but because they are part of urban environments. Diet and lifestyle changes also affects the gut, skin and respiratory microbiota.

At the same time that concerns about allergies and other chronic inflammatory diseases have been increasing, so also have concerns about infectious disease.&lt;ref name=stanwellsmith /&gt;&lt;ref name= Bloomfield /&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomfield2009&gt;Bloomfield SF, Exner M, Fara GM, Nath KJ, Scott, EA; Van der Voorden C.

Edited by William A. Rutala and David J. Weber&lt;/ref&gt; Infectious diseases continue to exert a heavy health toll. Preventing [[pandemics]] and reducing [[antibiotic resistance]] are global priorities. Hygiene is a cornerstone of containing these threats.

=== Infection risk management ===

The International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene has developed a risk management approach to reducing home infection risks. This approach uses microbiological and epidemiological evidence to identify the key routes of infection transmission in the home. These data indicate that the critical routes involve the hands, hand and food contact surfaces and cleaning utensils. Clothing and household linens involve somewhat lower risks. Surfaces that contact the body, such as baths and hand basins, can act as infection vehicles, as can surfaces associated with toilets. Airborne transmission can be important for some pathogens. A key aspect of this approach is that it maximises protection against pathogens and infection, but is more relaxed about visible cleanliness in order to sustain normal exposure to other human, animal and environmental microbes.&lt;ref name= bloomfield2012/&gt;

== Alternative hypotheses ==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2016}}

There are other hypotheses that try to explain the increase in [[Allergy|allergies]] in developed nations. Major areas of focus include infant feeding, over-exposure and exposure to certain pollutants.

Infant feeding topics includes breastfeeding, when babies begin to eat solid foods and the type of these foods, cow's milk vs other milks and variations in milk processing.

Over-exposure to allergens in occupational situations can cause allergic responses, such as [[Laboratory animal allergy]], [[Bird fancier's lung|bird lung]], [[farmer's lung]] and bakers lung (See [[Wheat allergy]]).

The [[pool chlorine hypothesis]] was proposed by Albert Bernard and his colleagues as an alternative hypothesis based on [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] evidence in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/oem.60.6.385 |title=Lung hyperpermeability and asthma prevalence in schoolchildren: Unexpected associations with the attendance at indoor chlorinated swimming pools |year=2003 |last1=Bernard |first1=A |journal=Occupational and Environmental Medicine |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=385–94 |pmid=12771389 |last2=Carbonnelle |first2=S |last3=Michel |first3=O |last4=Higuet |first4=S |last5=De Burbure |first5=C |last6=Buchet |first6=JP |last7=Hermans |first7=C |last8=Dumont |first8=X |last9=Doyle |first9=I |displayauthors=3|pmc=1740550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jimmy's family name is "Cebola" (''[[Onion]]'' in Portuguese), and he has a little baby sister called Mary Angela (in Portuguese, Maria Cebolinha, after her brother's name), also based on a real person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monica.com.br/ingles/personag/turma/ma-cebo.htm Mary Angela at Mônica's Gang official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621212355/http://www.monica.com.br/ingles/personag/turma/ma-cebo.htm |date=2009-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first adaptations of comics into English, the character's name was Stanley,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planetagibi.com.br/2010/03/monica-em-ingles-real-one.html&lt;/ref&gt; and later Frizz.

== Concept and creation ==
Jimmy Five first appeared in the comic books ''Zaz Trás'' and ''Bidu'' in 1960. [[Mauricio de Sousa]], creator of Monica's Gang, says he based the character on a child he knew while growing up in [[Mogi das Cruzes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hq.cosmo.com.br/textos/hqcoisa/h0158_mauricio70_1005.htm Maurício - 70 anos - MundoHQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129144208/http://hq.cosmo.com.br/textos/hqcoisa/h0158_mauricio70_1005.htm |date=2008-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a friend of his brother Márcio, and the boy would also switch the letter "r" for "l" and, because of his pointy hair, he earned the nickname "cebolinha" from Márcio's and Mauricio's father.&lt;ref name=MEturma&gt;{{cite web|title=Quem inspirou os personagens da Turma da Mônica?|url=http://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/materia/quem-inspirou-os-personagens-da-turma-da-monica|website=[[Mundo Estranho]]|publisher=[[Editora Abril]]|accessdate=23 November 2015|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, he was a 4-year-old boy who was a friend of Franklin and his gang, he was the youngest boy. In the first stories he was hairy, after Sousa returned to the newspaper strips, his design became more and more simple and began to be drawn with fewer hair strands.

He also has become the protagonist of the comics in 1961, in the place of Franklin and [[Blu (Monica's Gang)|Blu]]. He had several supporting friends in the very first comic strips, with more prominence in Specs and [[Smudge (Monica's Gang)|Smudge]] as his best friends and sidekicks. After the introduction of [[Monica (Monica's Gang)|Monica]] (based on the Sousa's daughter)&lt;ref name=filhos&gt;{{cite web|title=Personagens da Turma da Mônica inspirados nos filhos de Mauricio de Sousa|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/personagens-da-turma-da-monica-inspirados-nos-filhos-de-mauricio-de-sousa-16274329|website=[[O Globo]]|publisher=[[Grupo Globo]]|accessdate=28 May 2015|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the comic strips in 1963 he began to share the leading role with her over the years. In 1964 he came to have his current look with 5 hair strands. In 1970 with the release of the comic book, Monica became the title protagonist in place of Jimmy Five, but a comic book for Jimmy Five began to be published 3 years later.

== Characteristics ==
Jimmy Five is incapable of pronouncing the letter "r" , replacing it with the letter ''l'', in the Portuguese version, or with the letter ''w'', in the English version. When the letter is used in the end of a word, however, he pronounces it normally (as in "car" or "locker").

Out of the main cast of [[Monica's Gang]] he is the only one to regularly wear shoes (when barefoot, he is also one of the rare characters to be shown with toes). He often complains and despairs over his main physical feature - his lack of any hair other than five single strands. His madcap attempts to rectify this often causes him (and those around him) a great deal of grief. He was originally drawn with a full head of hair, which often becomes a topic in his laments to the comic artist to "help him out" and restore his full head of hair.

He is always plotting to steal either [[Monica (Monica's Gang)#Relatives and friends|Samson]] or the title of "owner of the street" from Monica with his "infallible plans" (which were initially created by [[Monica's Gang#Minor characters|Specs]]), which always end in failure, mostly because [[Smudge (Monica's Gang)|Smudge]] (his best friend) accidentally reveals to Monica that she is in a trap. On some stories, he gathers the other boys of the gang just to pick on Monica.

In some earlier stories, he devised background plans to find out the secret of her strength, but he always ended up beaten solely by her. Even with these frictions, Jimmy and Monica are still friends to each other. In the futuristic special edition stories, they are often portrayed as married or dating each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Sousa|first=Mauricio|title=Mônica 35 anos|year=1998|publisher=[[Editora Globo]]|location=São Paulo|pages=113|accessdate=13 March 2012|language=Portuguese|chapter=Parque 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Sousa|first=Mauricio|title=Mônica 30 anos|year=1993|publisher=[[Editora Globo]]|location=São Paulo|pages=233|accessdate=13 March 2012|language=Portuguese|chapter=30 anos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in [[Monica Teen]], they are seen kissing.&lt;ref name="News at G1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Quadrinhos/0,,MUL881139-9662,00-MONICA+E+CEBOLINHA+SE+BEIJAM+EM+NOVA+FASE+DA+TURMA.html|title=Mônica e Cebolinha se beijam em nova fase da turma|date=20 August 2008|publisher=[[Organizações Globo|G1]]|language=Portuguese|accessdate=20 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was once revealed that Jimmy is not the first one in his family to have his famous [[speech impediment]] and that it caused all his relatives (minus his father) to believe he will never be able to pronounce 'r'. However, this is disproven in the [[Monica Teen]] stories, where he is said to take up [[speech-language pathology]] sessions to correct his speech impediment;&lt;ref name="News at G1"/&gt; however, he reverts to mispronunciation when under stress or close to girls (especially Monica).&lt;ref name="News at G1"/&gt;

Whereas his family was always composed of his mother, father, and little sister, he once had a little brother, introduced in a 1972 story.&lt;ref name="little brother"&gt;{{cite book|last=de Sousa|first=Mauricio|title=Mônica|year=2011|publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=São Paulo|pages=40–61|edition=2nd|accessdate=18 December 2011|date=June 1972|language=Portuguese|chapter=O Irmãozinho}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jimmy himself even ended the story asking his readers to send name suggestions to [[Editora Abril]] (which published Monica's Gangs' comics at that time), but the toddler ended up disappearing from the stories.&lt;ref name="little brother"/&gt; Mauricio stated that he simply didn't have time to plan the continuation of his arrival, and the character was never featured again.&lt;ref name="little brother"/&gt;

== Related characters ==
* '''''Mrs. Five''''' (''Dona Cebola'', lit. Mrs. Onion) – Jimmy's mother. Spends most of her time as a [[housekeeping|housekeeper]], sometimes complaining about this. She is always worried about her weight.
* '''''Mr. Five''''' (''Seu Cebola'', lit. Mr. Onion) - Jimmy's father. Similar to Smudge's father, he is drawn simply as an adult Jimmy, the only differences being his nose and his height. He's very affectionate to his family and hard working with his job at a local business company. Unlike Jimmy, he does not suffer from speech impairments.
* '''''Mary Angela''''' (''Maria Cebolinha'') – Jimmy's little sister, introduced in 2001.&lt;ref name=filhos&gt;{{cite web|title=Personagens da Turma da Mônica inspirados nos filhos de Mauricio de Sousa|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/personagens-da-turma-da-monica-inspirados-nos-filhos-de-mauricio-de-sousa-16274329|website=[[O Globo]]|publisher=[[Grupo Globo]]|accessdate=28 May 2015|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her baby mind makes her a very curious and active person, which leads Jimmy to near-insanity, as he is the one to look for her when his parents are not home. Mary is based on [[Mauricio de Sousa]]'s oldest daughter, Mariângela Spada e Sousa.&lt;ref name="MEturma"/&gt;&lt;ref name=filhos/&gt;
* '''''Fluffy''''' (''Floquinho'') – Jimmy's dog. Originally, the dog belonged to his cousin from the countryside, but ended up becoming Jimmy's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monica.com.br/ingles/mauricio/cronicas/cron201.htm |title=Here comes Fluff, the 'toon pup |last=de Sousa |first=Mauricio |date=9 June 2000 |publisher=Monica's Gang official website |accessdate=27 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027045857/http://www.monica.com.br/ingles/mauricio/cronicas/cron201.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his long hair, no one can tell his head from his tail, and vice versa. This long hair caught many reader's eyes, and after years of arguments between fans on what breed he really belonged to it was announced his [[Dog breed|breed]] as being [[Lhasa Apso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Sousa|first=Mauricio|title=Cebolinha|year=2002|publisher=[[Editora Globo]]|location=São Paulo|pages=56–591|edition=1st|accessdate=13 March 2002|language=Portuguese|chapter=A Raça do Floquinho}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from his head and tail problem, another recurring gag in his strips is the fact that his long hair can hide plenty of objects (at one point hiding a missing airplane and its pilot, a missing cruise ship, a hot-dog vendor, and the mailman all at once).
* '''''Nutty Ned''''' (''Louco'', lit. Crazy man) – Nutty is a former [[psychiatric hospital]] inhabitant, and no matter how hard the doctors try to get him, he always manages to escape (despite the fact that, in some original stories, he is living in a nonsensical house whose real replica can be found at [[Monica's Gang|Parque da Mônica]] in [[São Paulo]]). He often appears at Jimmy Five's strips, irritating Jimmy with his insanity. In Portuguese, Nutty Ned always calls him "Cenourinha" (''Little Carrot'', in confusion with his Portuguese name "Cebolinha", literally, "Little Onion"). His strips are meant to be nonsensical and surreal, where Nutty Ned breaks the laws of physics. His crazy actions are often based on funny word plays and/or puns, and confusions caused by Jimmy's incapability to pronounce the ''r'' letter.

[[File:Dji Sam Soe.jpg|thumb|upright|[[:id:Dji Sam Soe|Dji Sam Soe 234]], a popular international brand of Kretek (clove cigarettes) manufactured by [[Philip Morris International]].]]

'''Kretek''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɛ|t|ɛ|k}} are [[cigarette]]s made with a blend of [[tobacco]], [[clove]]s and other flavors. The word "kretek" itself is an [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoetic]] term for the crackling sound of burning cloves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hanusz | first = Mark | title = Smoke; A Century of Kretek | pages = 140–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly due to favorable taxation compared to "white" cigarettes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usembassyjakarta.org/econ/kretek.html|title=June 3, 1999: Where There's Smoke, There's Kretek: The Cigarette Industry in Indonesia|accessdate=2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; kreteks are by far the most widely smoked form of cigarettes in [[Indonesia]], where they are preferred by about 90% of smokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indonesiamatters.com/1021/cigarette-production-consumption/|title=Cigarette Production &amp; Consumption|accessdate=2007-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Indonesia, there are hundreds of kretek manufacturers, including small local makers and major brands. Most of the widely known international brands, including [[:id:Dji Sam Soe|Dji Sam Soe 234]], [[Bentoel Group|Bentoel]], [[Nojorono|Minak Djinggo]], [[Djarum]], [[Gudang Garam]], and [[Gelora Djaja|Wismilak]] originate from Indonesia. [[Nat Sherman]] of the United States produces cigarettes branded as "A Touch of Clove" but they are not true kreteks since there is clove flavoring infused into small crystals located inside the filter, rather than actual clove spice mixed with the tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natsherman.com/product.cfm?CFID=3326&amp;CFTOKEN=36493773&amp;productid=1113|title=A Touch of Clove|accessdate=2007-12-30}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Lengte-sortering van tabak TMnr 10011742.jpg|thumb|[[Tobacco]] leaves sorting in Java. Tobacco was introduced by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] during the [[Dutch East Indies|colonial period]].]]

The origin of kretek cigarettes can be traced to the late 19th century. The creator of kretek was Haji Jamhari, a native of Kudus in Indonesia's [[Central Java]] region. Suffering from chest pains, Jamhari attempted to reduce the pain by rubbing clove oil on his chest. Jamhari sought a means of achieving a deeper relief and smoked his hand-rolled cigarettes after adding dried clove buds and rubber tree sap. According to the story, his asthma and chest pains vanished immediately. Word of Jamhari's product spread rapidly among his neighbors, and the product soon became available in pharmacies as ''rokok cengkeh''; clove cigarettes. First marketed as a medicinal product, kreteks became widely popular.

In those years, the locals used to hand-roll kreteks to sell on order without any specific brand, packing, or limits on ingredients used in production. A resident of Kudus named Nitisemito had the idea of starting serial production and selling kreteks under a proprietary brand name. Unlike other manufacturers, Nitisemito, who first created the Bal Tiga brand in 1906, enjoyed great success by implementing unprecedented marketing techniques, such as using embossed packs or offering free-of-charge promotional materials. Commercial manufacture did not start in earnest until the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gimonca.com/sejarah/sejarah05.shtml|title=Imperialism and Modernisation: 1830 to 1910|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Medicinale sigaretten in een doos TMnr 45-102.jpg|thumb|left|Kreteks from the 1910s, containing [[resin]], [[nutmeg]], [[cumin]], [[clove]], and [[tobacco]] wrapped in banana leaves.]]
Furthermore, he also developed a means of production called the abon system which offered opportunities for other entrepreneurs with insufficient capital. In this system, a person called an "abon" assumes the job of delivering finished products to the company which pays the price of piecework done whereas the company is liable to supply the necessary production materials to the "abons". Most manufacturers have since opted to have their workers working under the roof of their own factories, to maintain quality standards. Nowadays, only a few kretek manufacturers make use of the abon system.

During the period from 1960 until 1970, kreteks became a national symbol against "white cigarettes". In the mid-1980s, the number of machine-produced cigarettes exceeded that of hand-rolled ones. One of the largest income sources of Indonesia, the kretek industry comprises 500 large and small manufacturers employing a total of around 10 million people.&lt;ref&gt;Hanusz, Mark (2000) Kretek: The Culture and Heritage of Indonesia's Clove Cigarettes, Equinox Publishing {{ISBN|979-95898-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, kreteks are not legal for sale in the United States. A variation of the kretek is sold: "cigars" that are similar in size and shape to the original kreteks, also with a filter and the original tobacco/clove blend, but in a tobacco-based paper.

==Structure and ingredients==
The quality and variety of tobacco play an important role in kretek production. One kretek brand can contain more than 30 types of tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2006.confex.com/uicc/wctoh/techprogram/P4515.HTM|title=Kretek|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minced dried clove buds weighing about 1/3 of the tobacco blend are added. Sometimes, the last process which machine-made or hand-rolled kreteks go through is the spraying of sweetener at the butt end of the cigarette.

==Health effects==
[[Djarum Black]] cigarettes sold in [[Europe]], [[South Africa]] and [[South America]]n countries have 10&amp;ndash;12&amp;nbsp;mg [[Tar (tobacco residue)|tar]] and 1&amp;nbsp;mg [[nicotine]], as indicated on the pack. This level of tar and nicotine is comparable to the majority of other regular or "full-flavor" cigarettes available. Djarum Black cigarettes produced for consumption in Indonesia contain a significantly higher quantity of tar and nicotine, 25&amp;nbsp;mg and 1.6&amp;nbsp;mg respectively. In Canada, Djarum Black cigarettes are listed as containing 44.2&amp;ndash;86&amp;nbsp;mg of tar and 1.73&amp;ndash;3.24&amp;nbsp;mg of nicotine, a significant amount more than most other cigarettes. {{citation needed|reason=potentially detrimental information affecting the livelihood of brands requires citation |date=January 2016}}

The venous [[blood plasma|plasma]] [[nicotine]] and [[carbon monoxide]] levels from 10 smokers were tested after smoking kreteks and were found to be similar to non-clove brands of cigarettes, such as [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior | doi=10.1016/S0091-3057(02)01076-6 |title=Clove cigarette smoking: biochemical, physiological, and subjective effects |author1=J.L.

[[Rat]]s were given equal inhalation doses of conventional [[tobacco]] [[cigarettes]] and kreteks over a short period. Those that had inhaled kreteks did not appear to show worse health effects compared to those that had inhaled conventional cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Archives of Toxicology |title=Comparison of the inhalation toxicity of kretek (clove cigarette) smoke with that of American cigarette smoke. I. One day exposure |author=G.C.

The [[eugenol]] in [[clove]] smoke causes a numbing of the throat which can diminish the [[gag reflex]] in users, leading researchers to recommend caution for individuals with [[respiratory infection]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evaluation of the health hazard of clove cigarettes. Council on Scientific Affairs |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |author=__ |date=December 1988 |volume=260 |issue=24 |pages=3641&amp;ndash;36444 |pmid=3057254 |doi=10.1001/jama.260.24.3641}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been a few cases of [[aspiration pneumonia]] in individuals with normal respiratory tracts possibly because of the diminished gag reflex.

==Legal status in the United States==
In the [[United States]], cigarettes were the subject of legal restrictions and political debate, including a proposed 2009 [[United States Senate|US Senate]] bill that would have prohibited cigarettes from having a "characterizing flavor" of certain ingredients other than tobacco and [[menthol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:SN02461:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp; |accessdate=2007-08-01 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |title=A bill to protect the public health by providing the Food and Drug Administration with certain authority to regulate tobacco products. (Summary) |date=20 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control]] found kreteks account for a relatively small percentage of underage smoking, and their use was declining among high school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5245a2.htm|title=Tobacco Use Among Middle and High School Students&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; United  States, 2002|accessdate=2007-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the bill argued that support of the bill by the large U.S. tobacco maker [[Philip Morris USA|Philip Morris]], which makes only conventional and menthol cigarettes, indicated that the bill was an attempt to protect the company from competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/judgments/2009/06/08/cool-refreshing-legislation-philip-morris|title=Cool, Refreshing Legislation for Philip Morris|author=Paul Smalera|publisher=The Big Money from Slate|date=2009-06-08|accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some U.S. states, including [[Utah]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Maryland]], passed laws that prohibit the sale of kreteks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rjrt.com/legal/stateLawView.asp?State=md |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051018051513/http://www.rjrt.com/legal/stateLawView.asp?State=md |archivedate=2005-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 14 March 2005, Philip Morris International announced the purchase of Indonesian tobacco company PT HM Sampoerna after acquiring a 40% stake in Sampoerna from a number of Sampoerna's principal shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaccojournal.com/show_artikel.php3?id=4344|title=Clove encounter: Philip Morris acquires Sampoerna|accessdate=2007-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act]] was introduced in the US Congress and signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]], giving the [[FDA]] significantly more regulatory power over tobacco; one of the provisions in the law includes a ban on the use of flavors in tobacco, other than menthol. The ban includes kreteks. As of September 22, 2009, the clove cigarette was no longer legal to sell or distribute in the US, and cigarettes purchased overseas are subject to seizure by U.S. Customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://library.blogs.delaware.gov/2009/11/23/clove-cigarettes/|title=Delaware Division of Libraries Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an exception to this rule when receiving cigarettes as gifts through the [[USPS]] and is only allowed if certain guidelines are followed. This rule does not allow for purchase of tobacco products overseas but allows the receipt of gifts from domestic individuals and international individuals.{{Citation needed|reason=This statement needs to be supported by a citation of a reliable source.|date=April 2015}} However, Kretek International Inc., importer of the Djarum brand, continued to offer the clove and tobacco products as [[Cigarillo|little cigars]], which have lower taxes (in some U.S. states) and looser restrictions than cigarettes.

On April 12, 2010 [[Indonesia]] filed a formal complaint with the [[World Trade Organization]] stating the ban on kreteks in America amounts to discrimination because [[menthol cigarette]]s are exempt from the new regulation. Trade Ministry Director General of International Trade Gusmardi Bustami has stated that the Indonesian government has asked the WTO panel to review US violations on trade regulations, including the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) 1994, Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement. The TBT Agreement is of special importance as it defines clove cigarettes and menthol cigarettes as "like products". Claims of discrimination are enhanced when noting that 99% of kreteks were imported from countries other than the United States (chiefly Indonesia), while menthol cigarettes are produced almost entirely by American tobacco manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/07/21/wto-agrees-set-panel-rule-us-clove-cigarette-ban.html|title=WTO agrees to set up panel to rule on US clove cigarette ban|first=The Jakarta|last=Post|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia's case is further strengthened by comparing the number of young kretek smokers in America with the number of young menthol cigarette smokers. According to US health reports, 43% of young smokers smoke menthol cigarettes, which accounts for nearly 25% of the total cigarette consumption in the United States. Young smokers habituated to kreteks, however, account for less than 1% of cigarette consumption in the US, and &lt;1% of the total cigarettes sold in the US. On April 4, 2012, the WTO ruled in favor of Indonesia's claim, though it is unclear how this will affect U.S. law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wto-usa-indonesia-idUSBRE8330Y720120404|title=WTO dents U.S. ban on clove cigarettes|journal=Reuters|date=4 April 2017|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International sales ==
Kretek cigarettes are among others sold in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Australia, Brazil etc. In Europe only smaller packs and thinner cigarettes are sold to adhere to the EU established maximum amount of nicotine and tar levels. In South Africa they are also sold in smaller packs of 10 with between 10–12&amp;nbsp;mg tar, and 1-1.2&amp;nbsp;mg nicotine.

Indonesia is the world's largest producer of clove cigarettes, and exports up to US$500 million of the product a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/04/13/brazil-bans-sale-clove-cigarettes.html |title=Brazil bans sale of clove cigarettes |date=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3797">'''Lip Bumper''' is an appliance used in Dentistry, especially Orthodontics, for various purposes to correct a dentition by preventing the pressure from the soft tissue. Lip bumper is usually used in an orthodontic treatment where one has a crowded maxillary or mandibular teeth in an arch.

==Orthodontics==
Lip Bumper can be used for expansion of the teeth in the mandibular arch. In orthodontics, tooth-size discrepancy phenomenon occurs when there is crowding presented. As a treatment, either extractions of teeth or expansion of the arch can be done to correct the tooth-size discrepancy. Lip bumper is placed in front of the anterior teeth to keep the pressure of the lips and cheeks away from the front teeth and back teeth respectively. As cited by Werner et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Werner|first=S. P.|last2=Shivapuja|first2=P. K.|last3=Harris|first3=E. F.|date=1994-01-01|title=Skeletodental changes in the adolescent accruing from use of the lip bumper|journal=The Angle Orthodontist|volume=64|issue=1|pages=13–20; discussion 21–22|doi=10.1043/0003-3219(1994)064&lt;0013:SCITAA&gt;2.0.CO;2|issn=0003-3219|pmid=8172391}}&lt;/ref&gt; the lip bumper can be used for reduce lower anterior crowding, increase arch circumference, and move the permanent lower molars distally for the purpose of keeping anchorage.

Specific changes that occur because of this appliance including anterior teeth tipping forward, molar teeth tipping backwards and the increase in width of the arch formed by the lower teeth. The wire is kept 1.5 - 2.0mm from the front surface of the anterior teeth. Recently, advances have been made to use Lip Bumper with Mini-Screws for distalization of the upper back teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendes Júnior|first=Tadeu Evandro|last2=Lima|first2=Anderson Barbosa|last3=Mendes|first3=Tadeu Evandro|last4=Mendes|first4=Camila Vas Tostes|last5=Rosário|first5=Henrique Damian|last6=Paranhos|first6=Luiz Renato|date=2015-01-01|title=Distalization controlled with the use of lip-bumper and mini-screw as anchorage: a new approach|journal=International Journal of Orthodontics (Milwaukee, Wis.)|volume=26|issue=1|pages=29–32|issn=1539-1450|pmid=25881381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Korn Lip Bumper'' is a maxillary lip bumper which was developed by Korn and Shapiro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jco-online.com/archive/article-view.aspx?year=1994&amp;month=01&amp;articlenum=43|title=Flexible Lip Bumpers for Arch Development - Journal of Clinical Orthodontics|website=www.jco-online.com|access-date=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lip bumper is made up of .040in Stainless Steel wire and involves multiple loops. This lip bumper sits high in the maxillary vestibule and 2-3mm away from the attached gingiva. This type of bumper is often used with a bite plate.

== Side-Effects ==
Side-effects caused by Lip Bumper includes the possible disruption in the eruption pattern of the 2nd molars in the mandibular arch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferro|first=Fabrizia|last2=Funiciello|first2=Gloria|last3=Perillo|first3=Letizia|last4=Chiodini|first4=Paolo|date=2011-05-01|title=Mandibular lip bumper treatment and second molar eruption disturbances|journal=American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics|volume=139|issue=5|pages=622–627|doi=10.1016/j.ajodo.2009.07.024|issn=1097-6752|pmid=21536205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure of the lips on the lip bumper, causes the 1st molar to tip distally which effects and causes the impaction of the 2nd molar.

==Components==
Components of lip bumper include bands on the molar teeth, a thick Stainless Steel wire with loops made bilaterally and a thick acrylic or rubber shield that goes in the anterior part of the wire to not cause irritation to the mucosa of the lower lip.

'''Lytton Quarantine Station''' is a heritage-listed former [[quarantine station]] at 160 South Street, [[Lytton, Queensland|Lytton]], [[City of Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], Australia. It was built from 1913 to {{circa|1914}}. It is also known as Customs Reserve and Lytton Quarantine Complex and Animal Detention Centre. It is included within the [[Fort Lytton National Park]]. It was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 22 September 2000.&lt;ref name=qhr&gt;{{cite QHR|16110|Lytton Quarantine Station (former)|601347|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Lytton Quarantine Station was established in 1913-1914, to accommodate newly arrived immigrants and persons considered to be at risk of causing infection to the general population.. Situated at an isolated location at the mouth of the [[Brisbane River]], the place illustrates early 20th century attitudes to quarantine practices and the provision of quarantine facilities, and is important as part of a continuum of sites in and adjacent to [[Moreton Bay]], used for quarantine purposes from 1844.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

There were no human quarantine facilities at Moreton Bay during the penal era 1824-42, as all immigration came via Sydney. Following the opening of the district to free settlement in February 1842, a quarantine station was formed in 1844 at [[Dunwich, Queensland|Dunwich]], on [[Stradbroke Island]], at the site of a former goods transfer depot established by convicts in the late 1820s. From 1864, Dunwich served as both quarantine station and benevolent asylum. The quarantine station was relocated briefly to St Helena Island in Moreton Bay in 1866-67, along with the newly erected gaol there, but was soon returned to Dunwich. From 1874 to 1915 [[Peel Island]] in Moreton Bay served as [[Brisbane]]'s human quarantine station.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Lytton site, just south of [[Fort Lytton]] at the mouth of the Brisbane River, had a variety of uses prior to the establishment of the Quarantine Station in the early 20th century, occupying a former customs reserve (established 1858-59), sections of the early township of Lytton (surveyed in 1859), and an animal quarantine facility (established 1889).&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The history of the Lytton district is closely aligned to the establishment during the 1840s and 1850s of the Port of Moreton Bay at [[Town of Brisbane|Brisbane Town]], on the Brisbane River, rather than at [[Cleveland, Queensland|Cleveland]] on the Bay. Moreton Bay was proclaimed a Port of Entry, with the facilities to collect customs, in June 1846. Brisbane was declared a warehousing port in 1849 and a [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] was erected there in 1850. In 1857 the New South Wales colonial government began to investigate the suitability of establishing a customs station at the south head of the Brisbane River (present-day Lytton). In August 1857, surveyor James Warner completed a preliminary survey of a site for a village, which was approved in November 1858, and in December 1858 tenders were called for the construction of a Customs Station nearby on the river. In February 1859 Warner officially surveyed sections 1 to 13 of the village of Lytton, as well as sites for a customs landing place and a signal station. From 1 July 1859 a Tide Surveyor was stationed at Lytton. His job was to meet and board all ships entering the harbour, to prevent the evasion of customs duties. He was assisted by a coxswain and four boatmen, also stationed at the Lytton customs reserve. Following [[Separation of Queensland|separation from New South Wales]] in December 1859, the Queensland government maintained Lytton's role as the customs entry to the Port of Moreton Bay. From {{circa|1864}} Water Police-cum-Customs Officers were stationed on the gaol hulk [[Proserpine (ship)|Proserpine]] at the mouth of the Brisbane River. The Sub-inspector of the Water Police, based at the Lytton Customs Reserve, was also appointed as a health officer, and inspected all vessels entering the port.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Early buildings and structures associated with the Lytton Customs Station included: customs station (1858-9); electric telegraph station (1861); pilots' houses and sheds (1862); boatman's cottage (1863); boat slip (1863); health officer's house (1865); Lytton Wharf (1866); and additional boatmen's quarters (1872).&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Some sections of Lytton township were alienated between 1860 and 1863, mostly by Brisbane speculators who anticipated the development of wharf facilities at Lytton. Few private buildings were erected there. The Crown and Anchor Hotel operated at Lytton briefly in 1865-66, when a government wharf adjacent to the Customs Reserve was built in 1866 to tranship railway stores and plant for construction of the Southern and Western Railway. From 1878 until {{circa|1905}} the Lytton Hotel served local farmers and a military presence. Lytton State School was established {{circa|1882}}. In general, the district remained agricultural.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Sir [[George Bowen]], on completion of his term as Governor and departure from Moreton Bay on 4 January 1868, officially named and designated Lytton as Brisbane's port.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1877, Lytton was identified as the site for a defence fortification to guard the mouth of the Brisbane River. In 1880-82 Fort Lytton was constructed adjacent to and north of the Customs Reserve.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In the 1880s, colonial concern with the quarantine of imported animals led to the June 1889 proclamation of a small Reserve for Quarantine Purposes at Lytton (Reserve 230 - 1a 3r 29p), on the river adjacent to the Lytton Town Reserve and south of the Customs Reserve. Its location suggests it was for maritime quarantine. By May 1890 builders [[John Petrie]] &amp; Son had completed a cottage, stables and forage room on the Lytton Quarantine Reserve, and in 1893, dog kennels were constructed. In April 1894, in anticipation of an expected influx of imported animals following the lifting of restrictions on stock imports, an extension of {{convert|2|acre}} {{convert|2|rood}} to the Reserve for Quarantine Purposes at Lytton was proclaimed as Reserve 231. This extension occupied the southern half of the Customs Reserve. In 1891 and 1900, much of Lytton township was resumed for military purposes, with part of the 1900 resumption allocated to the Animal Quarantine Station. Several existing residences were used for customs personnel and others were removed from the site in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Following the formation of the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] in 1901, quarantine became a federal responsibility under the Commonwealth [[Quarantine Act 1908]]. From 1908-1911, the Queensland Commissioner of Public Health (a position created under Queensland's Health Act of 1900) performed the duties of quarantine officer for the Commonwealth. In 1910 Dr [[John Simeon Colebrook Elkington]] was appointed to this position, and in the following three years established Queensland's public health infrastructure, and oversaw the administration and implementation of State and Commonwealth quarantine practices. In 1922 Elkington wrote a text on quarantine procedures for the Commonwealth, which not only governed quarantine practice in Australia but was adopted as the model in at least three other countries.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In January 1912, the administration of quarantine facilities and practices in Queensland was transferred wholly to the Federal Quarantine Bureau. In December 1913, Elkington resigned his State position and joined the Commonwealth Health Service in Brisbane, overseeing the establishment of the quarantine facility at Lytton.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The establishment of a human quarantine station at Lytton was made practicable following the widening and deepening of the channel through the bar at the mouth of the Brisbane River, completed in 1911. This permitted deep-draught, ocean-going vessels to enter the Brisbane River. Construction of the Lytton Quarantine Station was undertaken by the Queensland Department of Works, financed by a Commonwealth loan, and approved by the Commonwealth Department of Home Affairs. Tenders were called in June 1913 for the construction of an administration building, isolation hospital, observation block, attendant's quarters, domestic quarters and stores, with the contract let to Lyons and Paton with a price of {{A£|5,153}}. The quarantine buildings were erected on the north eastern part of the reserve (now a vacant site, part of which is incorporated within [[Fort Lytton National Park]], and part on freehold land owned by [[Caltex]] Refineries (Qld) Ltd). It is possible that some of the buildings associated with the isolation hospital established at [[Colmslie, Queensland|Colmslie]] in the early 1900s were relocated to the Lytton Quarantine Reserve at this time. In 1914, tenders were called for a laundry, meat store, incinerating shed, footpath and tramway/trolley lines.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

[[File:StateLibQld 1 129895 Tents erected at the Lytton Quarantine Camp, Lytton, Brisbane, 1919.jpg|thumb|Tents erected at the Lytton Quarantine Camp, 1919]]
The quarantine station buildings were timber-framed and timber-clad with corrugated iron roofs and elevated on low concrete stumps. The wards were segregated with first, second and third class facilities (similar to arrangements on board ship). Some wards were mosquito-proofed, but most were not. At various times the quarantine station buildings also provided accommodation for persons stationed at adjacent [[Fort Lytton]]. The fort also played a role in the function of the quarantine station, controlling ships attempting to enter the Brisbane River without appropriate health clearances. In 1919 the world-wide outbreak of [[Spanish Influenza]] which followed the end of the [[First World War]] was delayed in Brisbane by some three months, following a strict quarantine at Lytton of personnel returning on troop ships.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

During Elkington's era, a venereal diseases hospital was established on the southern portion of the Lytton Quarantine Reserve, adjacent to South Street. This area is now owned by Caltex Refineries (Qld) Ltd.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

By 1928, the Lytton Quarantine Station facilities had been extended and enhanced. Vessels were met at the river mouth by the Health Authorities who boarded each ship (two launches were kept at Lytton) and inspected all goods and personnel on board. Suspect people and goods were landed at Lytton for fumigation and isolation. Jetty facilities permitted passengers to disembark on foot and a crane was provided for conveying sick passengers, luggage and stores to shore. A tram line ran from the jetty to the reception house. A permanent staff of a foreman assistant, two engine-drivers, a coxswain and four assistants was employed to maintain the facilities and attend to non-human quarantine, which included disinfection of luggage and materials using a steam disinfector ([[autoclave]]) with attachments for [[cyanide]] or [[formaldehyde]] gas. A bathing block permitted 10 cabin passengers and 20 crew, third class or deck passengers to bathe simultaneously. Separate accommodation in tents or troop huts had been established for Asiatics, with separate kitchen, dining-room, shelter shed, lavatory and bath blocks. Lighting was supplied from kerosene lamps. A water carriage sewerage system discharged directly into the river, with a chlorination chamber available for disinfection of sewerage as necessary. The medical officer's and foreman assistant's quarters were connected to the city telephone service and internal telephones served most of the principal buildings. A cemetery was located within the grounds. The Lytton facility functioned as a human quarantine station until the early 1980s, by which time the decision had been made to phase out human quarantine services. Arrangements were made for [[Kenmore Repatriation Hospital]] to provide observation facilities in the event that they were required, and in 1982 the Lytton facility reverted to its earlier role as an animal quarantine station, re-designated the Lytton Quarantine Complex and Animal Detention Centre. Facilities comprised a launch jetty, workshop, inflammable store, guinea pig area, imports treatment laboratory, utility buildings area, offices, stores, and animal quarantine detention facilities. In addition to its role as an animal quarantine centre, Lytton served as a communications centre, a base for south side shipping clearance and inspection, a facility for dealing with quarantine treatment and detention of materials, a training area and a depot for stores. Many of the buildings associated with the human quarantine station at Lytton were removed after the 1982 closure, some relocated to sites in the Lytton and [[Wynnum, Queensland|Wynnum]] districts.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

By the late 1980s the Lytton facility had closed completely. In 1988 management of part of the site and buildings, including the quarantine station jetty, was taken over by the Department of Environment, Conservation and Tourism, through the [[Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service]], associated with the administration of adjacent [[Fort Lytton]], which was declared an Historic National Park in 1990. The building currently used by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service as the administration centre for Fort Lytton, was relocated {{circa|1982}} from elsewhere on the former quarantine station reserve, where it once functioned as the doctor's quarters. In 1999, that part of the former Lytton Quarantine Station site managed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service was incorporated into [[Fort Lytton National Park]].&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The remainder of the former Lytton Quarantine Station site was transferred to the owners of the adjacent oil refinery (now Caltex Refineries (Qld) Ltd) in the late 1980s. No buildings associated with the quarantine station remain on this freehold land, but archaeological evidence of past human activity on the site was identified in a 1994 historical and archaeological survey of the former Lytton Quarantine Station, prepared for the Office of the Co-ordinator-General, Queensland. Although there has been little development of the freehold part of the site to date, for the purposes of this entry in the Queensland Heritage Register, the listing boundary is restricted to that part of the former Lytton Quarantine Station now incorporated within Fort Lytton National Park, at the northern end of the site, which contains a number of extant buildings and structures associated with the functioning of the site as a quarantine station. This does not in any way detract from the significance of the remainder of the site, which remains important for its association with early land use in the Lytton district from at least the 1850s, for its association with the human quarantine facility established at Lytton in the early 20th century, for its potential to reveal archaeological evidence, and for contributing to the sense of isolation which was characteristic of the quarantine facility established here in the 1910s.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Lytton Quarantine Station (former).jpg|thumb|Building at Lytton Quarantine Station]]
The former Lytton Quarantine Station is located on low, flat land adjacent to and south of Fort Lytton at the southern head of the mouth of the Brisbane River.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The principal structures and elements on that part of the former Lytton Quarantine Station now incorporated within Fort Lytton National Park, include: Jetty - constructed of timber planks bolted together and supported by wooden piles reinforced with concrete. It is associated with the earliest phase of the development of the quarantine station at Lytton, in the 1910s.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

=== Reception House ===
The reception house is a small, timber-framed, weatherboard-clad building with fibrous-cement sheeting and battening in the gabled ends. It has a corrugated iron roof and a verandah at the north end of the building which is constructed over tramway tracks that once linked the quarantine complex to the jetty to the west. The interior has been altered to accommodate offices, but the building remains substantially intact. It is associated with the earliest phase of the development of the quarantine station at Lytton, in the 1910s.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

=== Tram/trolley bridge foundations ===
The tram/trolley bridge foundations comprise pairs of steel reinforced concrete footings set {{convert|2|m}} apart, leading west from the Reception House toward the jetty. In some places wooden sleepers are visible, but the majority of the decking and all the rails are missing. This element is associated with the earliest phase of the development of the quarantine station at Lytton, in the 1910s.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

=== Bath House ===
The bath house is a large, rectangular, timber-framed, building with weatherboard-cladding to above sill height, above which is fibrous-cement sheeting and battening. It has a corrugated iron roof with ventilators along the ridge, and rests on a concrete slab. No evidence of services such as shower fittings, etc. remains, but the original interior layout is still discernible and the upper level observation post, at the north end of the building, is intact. Two square brick-lined drainage traps ({{convert|620|x|620|mm}}) are located on the eastern side of the shower block. The building is associated with the earliest phase of the development of the quarantine station at Lytton, in the 1910s.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

=== Boiler House ===
The boiler house is a tall, rectangular brick building with engaged piers, corrugated iron roof, substantial external [[chimney]] stack and external drains, with boilers and associated fittings internally. The whole is remarkable intact, and is associated with the earliest phase of the development of the quarantine station at Lytton, in the 1910s.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

=== Fuel Shed ===
The fuel shed is a small, later, timber-framed, weatherboard-clad structure with a low-pitched corrugated iron roof, adjacent to the eastern end of the boiler room.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

=== Disinfecting block ===
The disinfecting block is a large, rectangular, timber-framed, building with weatherboard-cladding to above sill height, above which is fibrous-cement sheeting and battening. It has a corrugated iron roof and rests on a concrete slab. The internal autoclave and associated fittings are in-situ, along with trolley track and trolleys. Trolley or tram lines run west out of the centre of the western end of the building, toward the jetty. An overhead pipeline from the boiler house to the south side of the disinfecting block attaches to the autoclave. The building is remarkably intact, and is associated with the earliest phase of the development of the quarantine station at Lytton, in the 1910s.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

=== Laundry Block ===
The laundry block is a rectangular, timber-framed, building with weatherboard-cladding to above sill height, above which is fibrous-cement sheeting and battening. It has a corrugated iron gabled roof with iron ventilators along the ridge and on the west side of the roof. The building rests on a concrete slab, and has a verandah over a concrete pathway along part of the western side of the building. There is a later, tall metal roller door at the north end of the building, but the remaining doors and fenestration appear to be original. Concrete footings associated with former tank stands are evident on the east side of the building. The building is remarkably intact, and is associated with the earliest phase of the development of the quarantine station at Lytton, in the 1910s. Enclosed laundry yard - the yard area to the east and south of the laundry block has a concrete retaining wall approximately {{convert|150|mm}} high and {{convert|150|mm}} wide. The west and east sides of the yard are bounded by round metal posts capped with concrete while the south side is defined by tram/trolley rails set vertically as posts ({{convert|1500|mm}} high). There is an open concrete drain along the eastern side of the yard, inside the fence posts. The yard contains 12 square wooden posts approximately {{convert|2|m}} in height, which are likely to have supported clothes lines. A service inspection hatch is located centrally in the southern section of the yard. This has a {{convert|1|x|1|m}} concrete housing with a {{convert|600|x|600|mm}} steel lid with embossed cross-hatching and the lettering "Harvey &amp; Son". A block of late 20th century relocatable toilets is also sited in this yard. Despite this, the yard remains substantially intact, and is associated with the earliest phase of the development of the quarantine station at Lytton, in the 1910s.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

=== Two launchmen's cottages ===
The two timber-framed, weatherboard clad launchmen's cottages are located along the eastern boundary of that part of the former Lytton Quarantine Station which has been incorporated into Fort Lytton National Park, south of the laundry and laundry yard. Originally there were three cottages, but the middle house has been removed. The two remaining houses have corrugated iron roofs and rest on low concrete piers. Although no interior inspection has been made, these houses appear to be reasonably intact. They are associated with the earliest phase of the development of the quarantine station at Lytton, in the 1910s.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

=== Doctor's Quarters ===
The doctor's quarters is a two-storeyed building currently functioning as the administration centre for Fort Lytton National Park. It was initially a single-storeyed, timber-framed, weatherboard-clad house which has been relocated from elsewhere on the site to its present position south of the Bath House, raised, to create a ground floor which is enclosed with fibrous-cement planking. Although no longer in situ, the place was associated with the earliest phase of the development of the quarantine station at Lytton, in the 1910s.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

=== Workshop ===
The worshop is a small, rectangular, brick structure, resting on a concrete slab. It has a corrugated iron roof which is lined with timber boards. Internally, exposed roof [[truss]]es have been cut and braced to provide higher clearance for machinery. Outside, along the eastern side of the building is a concrete slab and seven pairs of concrete piers in ramp-like formation. On the western side of the building is This structure appears to correspond with a building marked "workshop" identified on a 1918 plan of the site. It now functions as a machinery store.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

=== Sewerage Treatment Plant ===
At the far southwest of the site is a small, early sewerage treatment facility {{convert|14.8|m}} long and {{convert|5.5|m}} wide. It is of concrete construction, and has a central rectangular wire mesh cage filled with coarse rubble which possibly functioned as primary filtration of effluent. The plant remains substantially intact, and is associated with the earliest phase of the development of the quarantine station at Lytton, in the 1910s.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

===Grounds and surrounds===
Apart from the relocation of the former Doctor's Quarters to the northwestern end of the site, the surviving buildings and other structural and archaeological elements maintain their original spatial relationship. The surrounding grounds are mostly grassed, with a new bitumen road, which leads to the present entrance to Fort Lytton, established west of the original metalled roadway into the quarantine station. There are a number of mature, though not large, trees, at the southern end of the site, associated with the former quarantine station.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

At the north east end of the site is an unoccupied block, fenced off, and formerly the site of the administrative building, attendant's quarters, stores, isolation hospital and observation block, associated with the establishment of the Lytton Quarantine Station in 1913-14. All of these buildings have been removed from the site, but a number of archaeological elements associated with the quarantine station have been identified. These include the concrete foundation slab and some wall remnants of the former Laboratory Building/Morgue at the far eastern end of the site; the concrete foundation slab of a building marked "laundry" on a 1918 plan, at the western side of the site; the concrete foundation slab of a small building identified as "Receiving Shed" on a 1918 plan, at the northern end of the site; and elements of the early drainage system associated with the former Lytton Quarantine Station.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Lytton Quarantine Station extended a considerable distance to the south of what is now Fort Lytton National Park, and included a venereal diseases hospital and animal quarantine facilities. The 1994 archaeological survey of all {{convert|31|ha}} of the site identified 237 features associated with the historic use of the site from at least the 1910s. That part of the former Lytton Quarantine Station not included within Fort Lytton National Park is not included within the listing boundary for the entry in the Queensland Heritage Register.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
The Lytton Quarantine Stationwas listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 22 September 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.'''

The Lytton Quarantine Station and site is important in illustrating the evolution of Queensland's history, being associated with:
* the early establishment of Lytton township and district prior to Separation in 1859
* the early establishment of maritime customs and telegraph facilities in Queensland
* the provision of animal quarantine facilities in the late 19th century
* the provision of human quarantine facilities in the early 20th century
In particular, the place is important in illustrating the evolution of attitudes and approaches to the management of infectious diseases in Australia in the immediate post-Federation period. The place is also significant historically as part of a continuum of sites in and adjacent to Moreton Bay used for human quarantine purposes from 1844 to 1982.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.'''

While only some of the Lytton buildings remain, the site still provides important, rare surviving evidence of early 20th century Australian quarantine stations.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history.'''

The place has potential to yield historical archaeological information, especially with regard to the location of the burial ground associated with the human quarantine facility, the likely location of which was adjacent to the morgue at the northeast end of the site.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.'''

The surviving quarantine buildings, being substantially intact and mostly in situ, are important in illustrating the principal characteristics of an early 20th century Australian marine quarantine station, including the isolated location, building types (materials, forms, design, aesthetics, coherency and functions), spatial arrangements and grounds layout, and provision of services. Of the three early 20th century quarantine stations established by the Federal Government in Queensland (at Thursday Island, Cape Pallarenda (Townsville) and Lytton (Brisbane)), the Lytton facility was the first and the largest.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.'''

Appropriate interpretation of the surviving buildings, structures and other elements at the northern end of the former Lytton Quarantine Station has the potential to graphically and physically illustrate the experience of the quarantine process which many immigrants to Australia encountered.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''

The place has considerable social significance, being associated with the reception of immigrants in Queensland for nearly 70 years. Being quarantined at Lytton was often an immigrant's first experience of life in Queensland and in Australia.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.'''

The place has a special association with the work of Dr JSC Elkington, who was responsible for the design and development of Queensland's early 20th century public health infrastructure, and who became an authority on quarantine practice in post-Federation Australia. The Lytton Quarantine Station remains illustrative of his work.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4627">'''Macrodystrophia lipomatosa''' (ML) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by localised overgrowth of a part of an extremity or less commonly a whole extremity. The involvement of more than one extremity is even more uncommon. There is a slight predilection for the lower limb affection namely the foot. The overgrown region consists predominantly of adipose tissue. Yet, other tissue components that represent the  mesenchyme may be involved.&lt;ref name= Prasetyono2015&gt;Prasetyono TO, Hanafi E, Astriana W (2015).

==Clinical presentation==

Macrodystrophia lipomatosa can manifest in functional  incapacitation and esthetic problems. It is usually noticed by parents at birth or shortly after. It may be subject to an increase in size especially around puberty. The diagnosis is largely built upon establishing a comprehensive correlation between history and clinical examination on the one hand and characteristic imaging features on the other hand namely plain radiographs, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging examination.&lt;ref name="Abdulhady2018"/&gt;

==Imaging findings==

Plain radiographs may show bone overgrowth and deformity together with osteoarthritis changes in advanced cases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to delineate the extent of abnormal fatty tissue in various sequences.&lt;ref name="Abdulhady2018"/&gt; It may also be used as a tool for the differential diagnosis of ML.&lt;ref name=Abdulhady2018/&gt;

==Differential diagnosis==

The differential diagnosis of macrodystrophia lipomatosa includes a wide array of disorders which result in various degrees and patterns of limb overgrowth especially those occurring in childhood and adolescence.

==Management==

No medical therapy exists for such a disorder. Treatment depends upon the patient's symptomatology. Gait and functional problems may be addressed by foot wear adjustments. Esthetic complaints may be addressed through plastic surgery procedures such as debulking surgery. If a significant deformity is present a corrective osteotomy can be performed in conjugation. Digital amputation is reserved for severe deformities with or without pain.

[[File:MedicalExaminerVan.jpg|right|thumb|Medical examiner van]]

A '''medical examiner''' is a person trained in medicine or a medical organization that investigates deaths and injuries that occur under unusual or suspicious circumstances, to perform [[post-mortem]] examinations, and in some jurisdictions to initiate [[inquest]]s.&lt;ref name=CvM&gt;{{cite web|title=Coroner vs. medical examiner|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/visibleproofs/galleries/cases/examiner.html|website=Visible Proofs|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical examiners, [[coroner]]s and [[forensic pathologist]]s are often thought to be the same, but they are different professions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/medical-examiner/|title=Forensic Medical Examiner Jobs in Forensic Criminal Investigations|website=www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2018}} Coroners have a completely different role as well as having differing responsibilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In some parts of the United States, unlike a medical examiner or forensic pathologist, coroners are elected officials and may not require the extensive medical training that the former must go through.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Job roles==
A medical examiner's duties may vary depending on location. The medical examiners’ job is usually extensive and has a lot that goes into it. Typically, a medical examiner's duties may include:

* investigating human organs like the stomach, liver, brain,
* determining cause of death,
* examining the condition of the body&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* studying tissue, organs, cells, and bodily fluids&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* issuing [[death certificates]],
* maintaining [[Death Records|death records]],
* responding to deaths in mass disasters,
* working closely with [[law enforcement]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://explorehealthcareers.org/career/forensic-science/forensic-pathologist/|title=Forensic Pathologist {{!}} explorehealthcareers.org|website=explorehealthcareers.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* identifying unknown dead, or
* performing other functions depending on local law.

In some [[jurisdictions]],  a [[coroner]] performs these and other duties. It’s not uncommon for a medical examiner to visit [[crime scene]]s or to testify in [[court]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This takes a certain amount of confidence in which the medical examiner has to rely on their expertise to make a true [[testimony]] and accurately testify the facts of their findings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Medical examiners specialize in [[Forensic science|forensic]] knowledge and rely on this during their work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to studying [[cadaver]]s, they are also trained in [[toxicology]], DNA technology and [[forensic serology]] (blood analysis).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Pulling from each area of knowledge, a medical examiner can accurately determine a cause of death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This information can help law enforcement crack a case and is crucial to their ability to track criminals in the event of a [[homicide]] or other related events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Within the United States, there is a mixture of coroner and medical examiner systems, and in some states, [[Dual systems model|dual systems]].  The requirements to hold office vary widely between jurisdictions.

==Qualifications==

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|formal medical training]] is required for medical examiners. Many employers also request training in [[pathology]] while others do not. In the UK, a medical examiner is always a medically trained professional, whereas a [[Coroner#England and Wales|coroner]] is a [[judicial officer]].

Pilot studies in Sheffield and seven other areas, which involved medical examiners looking at more than 27,000 deaths since 2008, found 25% of hospital death certificates were inaccurate and 20% of causes of death were wrong. [[Suzy Lishman]], president of the [[Royal College of Pathologists]], said it was crucial there was "independent scrutiny of causes of death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Medical examiners help expose patient safety risks|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/exclusive-medical-examiners-help-expose-patient-safety-risks/5081968.article#.VP9HiPzkdc4|accessdate=10 March 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Qualifications for medical examiners in the US vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  In Wisconsin, for example, some counties do not require individuals to have any special educational or medical training to hold this office.&lt;ref&gt;Coroners and Medical Examiners: A Comparison of Options Offered by Both Systems in Wisconsin Jenifer Keach, Rock (WI) County Coroner, April 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In most jurisdictions, a medical examiner is required to have a [[medical degree]], although in many this need not be in pathology. Other jurisdictions have stricter requirements, including additional education in [[pathology]], law, and [[forensic pathology]]. Medical examiners are typically appointed officers.&lt;ref&gt;National Academy of Sciences, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward, (2009), pp 241–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
In the United States, the road to becoming a medical examiner is a long and hard one. They require a lot of extensive training in order to become experts in their field.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After high school, the additional schooling may take 11–18 years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  They must attend a [[college]] or [[university]] to receive a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor’s degree]] in the sciences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Biology]] is usually the most common.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://learn.org/articles/Medical_Examiner_How_to_Become_a_Medical_Examiner_in_5_Steps.html|title=How to Become a Medical Examiner in 5 Steps|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, it takes four years to complete a bachelor’s degree.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A medical degree (Doctor of Medicine, MD) is required to become a medical examiner.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.forensicsciencecareers.net/medical-examiner.html|title=Medical Examiner - Forensic Science Careers|work=Forensic Science Careers|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; To prepare for medical school, the [[Medical College Admission Test|MCAT]] (Medical College Admissions Test) must be taken and passed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Medical school]] is another four years with the first two dedicated to academics and the rest of the two used to gain [[clinic]]al experience.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Additional training is required after medical school. The first step is to complete pathological forensic training.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This usually consists of anatomic and clinical pathology training which takes anywhere from four to five years to complete.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After this, an anatomic pathology [[residency (medicine)|residency]] and/or a [[fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] in forensic pathology should be completed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Before practicing, they must also become certified through the [[American Board of Pathology]];&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; this certificate is good for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://learningpath.org/articles/Becoming_a_Medical_Examiner_Salary_Info_Job_Description.html|title=Becoming a Medical Examiner: Salary Info &amp; Job Description|website=learningpath.org|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Job outlook ==
The general job outlook for medical examiners in the United States is considered to be excellent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Salary varies greatly by state and location, but it is estimated to average between $105,000 and $500,000 a year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==In popular culture==

More and more [[hospital]]s engage them as physician practices are acquired and more physicians are employed.  There are several trade association in the US for healthcare business consultants, the largest by-far being the [[National Society of Certified Healthcare Business Consultants]] (NSCHBC) that also serves dental, podiatric, chiropractic, physical therapy, and other subspecialty practice management consultants. NSCHBC offers a credential in the field; [[certification|Certified]] Healthcare Business Consultant or "CHBC"; a directory searchable by specialty and state; and continuing education programs.

'''Netcare''' (''Network Healthcare Holdings Limited'') is a [[South Africa]]n health care company. It is the largest provider of private healthcare (ahead of LIFE Healthcare, formally known as Afrox Healthcare and Mediclinic International) in both South Africa and the [[United Kingdom]]. It acquired a controlling stake in the UK's [[General Healthcare Group]] in 2006, and provides services to the [[National Health Service]] via its subsidiary [[General Healthcare Group]]. The current chairman is [[Meyer Kahn]].

==History==
Netcare was established in 1996, and was listed on the [[JSE Limited]] (Johannesburg Stock Exchange) the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Netcare, [http://www.netcare.co.za/content/5335/home/ Group History]&lt;/ref&gt; It initially expanded into the UK in 2001. In 2002 it won The Ophthalmic Chain contract
in Kent, Merseyside, Cumbria, Lancashire, Hampshire, and Thames Valley, to carry out 44,500 cataract removals over a 5-year period and the £2.5bn contract for the  Greater Manchester Surgical Centre, a 48-bed facility at [[Trafford General Hospital]] to provide 44,863 elective procedures over 5 years with a diagnostics programme valued at £1bn.  In 2004 it signed a contract to carry out 41,600 cataract operations for the NHS at sites throughout the UK including [[Cumberland Infirmary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Patients get 'private' eye ops|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cumbria/3782343.stm|accessdate=17 October 2014|publisher=BBC News|date=7 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company acquired a controlling stake in [[General Healthcare Group]], the UK's largest private hospital group with 50 hospitals, in 2006 for £2.2 billion. This brought Netcare’s total number of hospitals to 120 with over 11,000 beds, 510 operating theatres, and 37 pharmacies. GHG had a subsidiary company, [[Amicus Health]] which tendered for NHS contracts.  It had contracts with [[Stracathro Hospital]] for 8000 episodes of elective surgery in orthopaedics, urology, general surgery and gastroenterology from 2006-9.The company used [[Vanguard Healthcare]] mobile units to treat NHS cataract patients across the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Providing solutions which enable patients to receive care closer to their homes|url=http://www.vanguardhealthcare.co.uk/cs5.php|publisher=Vanguard Healthcare|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mobile cataract units in Cumbria had failure rates 6 times that of local NHS facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Netcare Briefing|url=http://www.keepournhspublic.com/pdf/Netcarebriefing.pdf|publisher=Keep Our NHS Public|accessdate=17 October 2014|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

6 patients who were treated at the [[Royal Hospital Haslar]] in Portsmouth in 2006 sued after faulty hip operations.  Netcare blamed a single rogue surgeon who had since been excluded from operating and said this was ‘an isolated incident’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It sounds like an upgrade. But being sent to a private clinic by the NHS can end in tears|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2242521/It-sounds-like-upgrade-But-sent-private-clinic-NHS-end-tears.html|accessdate=17 October 2014|publisher=Daily Mail|date=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 five doctors from Netcare, two transplant unit staff, and the chief executive officer were charged for allegedly participating in an international kidney trading syndicate in which poor Brazilians and Romanians were paid to donate kidneys to wealthy Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charges on South Africa 'kidney trafficking syndicate'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11328018|accessdate=16 October 2014|publisher=BBC News|date=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company pleaded guilty to conducting 109 illegal operations between 2001 and 2003.  It admitted receiving 3.8 million rand (£342,000) from the syndicate.  Netcare KwaZulu, in South Africa's eastern KwaZulu-Natal province, paid 7,820,000 rand (£704,000) in fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=South African hospital pleads guilty to organ trafficking case|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/8124710/South-African-hospital-pleads-guilty-to-organ-trafficking-case.html|accessdate=16 October 2014|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''No Net Cost Tobacco Act of 1982''' (P.L. 97-218) required that the [[Tobacco Price Support Program]] operate at no net cost to [[Tax|taxpayers]], other than for the administrative expenses common to all [[price support]] programs. To satisfy this mandate, sellers and buyers (including importers) of tobacco were assessed equally to build a capital account that was drawn upon to reimburse the [[Commodity Credit Corporation]] (CCC) for any losses of principal and interest resulting from nonrecourse [[loan]] operations. Other provisions of this law provided for reducing the level of support for tobacco and made various modifications to the marketing quota and acreage allotment programs. No net cost assessments ended when price support was terminated after the 2004 crop.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3463">'''Nothing But Nets''' is a global, grassroots campaign of the [[United Nations Foundation]]  to raise awareness and funding to fight [[malaria]], a leading cause of death among children in Africa.

The campaign aims to prevent [[malaria]] deaths  by purchasing, distributing, and teaching the proper use of [[mosquito net|mosquito bed nets]] to end malaria deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa. As of 2012, the campaign has distributed nets in twenty countries throughout [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] with current plans to expand into [[Kenya]] and [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name="NBN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nothingbutnets.net/learn/|title=Nothing But Nets: Where we send nets|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The UN Foundation and its partners use the money raised by donations to Nothing But Nets to fight malaria.  In conjunction with the [[Measles Initiative]], a global [[vaccination]] effort to fight measles, Nothing But Nets purchases and distributes bed nets in countries and communities in greatest need.&lt;ref name="NBN"/&gt;

[[Rick Reilly]]'s 2006 column about malaria in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', wherein he challenged his readers to donate at least $10 for the purchase of anti-malaria bed nets, brought the issue to national attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/rick_reilly/04/25/reilly0501/index.html|title=Rick Reilly Article|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Americans across the country donated leading to the creation of the Nothing But Nets campaign.

==Partnerships==
The UN Foundation has partnered with groups as diverse as [[National Basketball Association]]’s [[NBA Cares]], Major League Soccer WORKS, the people of the [[United Methodist Church]], and ''Sports Illustrated'' to bring Nothing But Nets to the American public.&lt;ref name="NBN Campaign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nothingbutnets.net/about-the-campaign/|title=Nothing But Nets Campaign|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umc.org/news-and-media/nothing-but-nets-campaign-to-be-launched-november-14|title='Nothing But Nets' Campaign to be Launched November 14 – The United Methodist Church|first=United Methodist|last=Communications|website=The United Methodist Church|accessdate=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Founding Partners have been joined by corporate, multimedia, and financial partners to make a significant impact by raising awareness and funds to purchase and distribute bed nets to save lives.

In '''''Osborn v. Irwin Memorial Blood Bank''''', 5 Cal.App.4th 234 (1992), the [[Court of Appeals of California]] considered certain questions pertaining to whether a [[blood bank]] could be held liable for [[negligence]] or [[negligent misrepresentation]] after a patient contracted [[HIV/AIDS]] as a result of a [[blood transfusion]].

==Factual background==
In 1983, Michael Osborn, an infant, underwent surgery to repair a [[congenital heart defect]].  During that surgery, Osborn received a blood transfusion.  At the time of the transfusion, donated blood was not routinely tested for [[human immunodeficiency virus]], because the cause of [[AIDS]] had not definitively been identified yet.

Fearing that AIDS could be transmitted by blood, the Osborns had requested to make [[blood donation#Types of donation|directed blood donations]] specifically earmarked for use by Michael.  They first contacted the surgeon, who informed them that they needed to contact the blood bank.  The receptionist at the blood bank, however, said that directed donations were not allowed, and so the surgery proceeded using blood from the public supply.  He subsequently was diagnosed with [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS).

==The trial==
The patient and his family sued the University of California (where the surgery occurred) and the [[Blood Centers of the Pacific|Irwin Memorial Blood Bank]] (which supplied the blood) for multiple [[causes of action]].  A jury trial took place.  The blood bank introduced evidence that its safety procedures were at least as good as those generally prevailing at the time.  The blood bank also sought to introduce evidence that, because the patient was [[blood type|type A negative]], he could not receive any donations from members of his family, as a result of which only a small amount of blood (or no blood at all) would have been able to be provided by means of [[blood donation#Types of donation|directed donation]], but the judge did not allow defendants to present this evidence to the jury.

At the conclusion of the evidence the trial judge granted the defendants' motions for [[nonsuit]] on several of the causes of action, and [[directed verdict|directed a verdict]] in favor of the university on the remaining causes of action.  Thus, only the blood bank remained as a defendant, and the following questions were submitted to the jury:

* Was the blood bank [[negligence|negligent]]?
* Did the blood bank commit the tort of intentional misrepresentation when the receptionist stated that [[blood donation#Types of donation|directed blood donations]] were not allowed?
* Did the blood bank commit the tort of negligent [[misrepresentation]] when the receptionist stated that directed blood donations were not allowed?

The jury returned a general verdict in favor of the plaintiffs and awarded them a total of $750,000.  The blood bank moved for [[judgment notwithstanding the verdict]] and also moved for an amended judgment on the grounds that the damages awarded were in excess of those allowed under the [[Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act]] (MICRA).  The trial court acknowledged that it had erred when it had held that MICRA did not apply, and the blood bank moved for a new trial.

The court granted the blood bank's motion for [[judgment notwithstanding the verdict]] as to the counts of negligence and intentional [[misrepresentation]] and, conditioned on the plaintiffs' acceptance, reduced the award to $416,307.  Both sides appealed.

==The appeal==
There were three issues on appeal:

* Did the trial court err in granting [[judgment notwithstanding the verdict]] in favor of the defendant on the count of negligence?
* Should there be a new trial on the count of [[negligent misrepresentation]]?
**Did the trial court err in excluding evidence regarding the patient's blood type?
**If the trial court erred, should it grant a new trial or grant a directed verdict in favor of the defendants?
* Did the trial court err in dismissing the case against the university?

The California Court of Appeals ruled in favor of defendants on the count of negligence, held that the defendants were entitled to a new trial on the issue of negligent misrepresentation, and ruled in favor of the university.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21516">The '''Pavlovian session''' ({{lang-ru|Павловская сессия}}) was the joint session of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]] and the [[USSR Academy of Medical Sciences]] held on June 28 to July 4, 1950.&lt;ref name="Pavlovian session"&gt;Scientific Session on the Physiological Teachings of Academician Ivan P.

During the session, a number of [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s former students attacked another group of his students ([[Leon Orbeli]], [[Pyotr Anokhin]], Aleksey Speransky, [[Ivan Beritashvili]]) whom they accused of deviating from Pavlov's teaching. As the result of this session, Soviet physiology self-excluded itself from the international scientific community for many years.&lt;ref name="Windholz 1997"&gt;Windholz G (1997) 1950 Joint Scientific Session: Pavlovians as the accusers and the accused.

European Psychologist 2: 102-105 Special issue: 100 Years After Ivan P. Pavlov's The Work of the Digestive Glands.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preceding events ==
The Pavlovian session followed a sequence of Stalin's interferences in academic affairs during the post-war time:

* In 1947, [[Georgy Aleksandrov]] asked Stalin to review his textbook for university students entitled "History of West European Philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;G.F. Aleksandrov, Istoria Zapadnoevropeiskoi Filosofii (Moscow, Leningrad: Izdatel'stvo Akademii Nauk SSSR, 1946).&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin criticized the book as an attempt to analyze philosophy from a pro-Western position rather than using the principles of Marxism–Leninism.&lt;ref name="Iaroshevskiy"&gt;M. G. Iaroshevskiy "Pavlovska&amp;ia Sessiya" 1950 g. i Sud'by Sovetskoi Fiziologii," Voprosy Istorii Estestvoznaniya i Tekhniki, No. 3, (1988): 129–136. See pp. 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1948, Stalin strongly supported [[Lysenkoism|Lysenko's work]] on the inheritance of acquired characteristics in plants which has now been discredited. Lysenko's research was thought to hold the promise of strengthening the Soviet Union's agriculture.
* In 1949, Stalin declared an opposition to cosmopolitism.&lt;ref&gt;V.V. Fanardzhian. L. A. Orbeli i Ob'edinennaia Sessiya Dvukh Akademii (1950 g.), Fiziologicheskii Zhurnal SSSR im. I. M. Sechenova 76(12) (1990): 1816–1822.&lt;/ref&gt; Great Soviet Encyclopedia defined cosmopolitism as a "reactionary bourgeois ideology of rejecting national traditions and national sovereignty by preaching indifferent relationship to one's country and national culture and advocating the establishment of a 'world government' and 'world citizenship.' "&lt;ref&gt;B.A. Vvedenskiy, ed. Bol'shaya Sovetska&amp;ia Entsiklopediya. 2nd ed., vol. 23, (Moscow: Gosudarstvennoe Nauchnoe Izdatel'stvo "Bol'shaya Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya, 1953). See p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1949, Stalin commented on the issues of linguistics, in particular he criticized the view that language was a derivative of an economic base.&lt;ref&gt;J. Stalin, Marxism and Linguistics (NY: International Publishers, 1951).&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin also stated that "no science can develop and flourish without a battle of opinions, without freedom of criticism."

The interference in physiology, psychology and psychiatry was initiated in the summer of 1949 when Stalin instructed the Minister of
Health Yefim Smirnov to hold a session on Pavlov's teachings.&lt;ref name="Iaroshevskiy"/&gt; On 28 September 1949, on the eve of the 100th anniversary of Pavlov's birth, [[Yuri Zhdanov]] reported to Stalin about the "serious trouble" with the development of Pavlov's teaching and put the blame on Orbeli, Beritashvili, and arrested Stern. In replying to this report, Stalin wrote: "In my opinion, the greatest harm to Academician Pavlov's teaching was done by Academician Orbeli... The sooner Orbeli will be exposed and the more thoroughly his monopoly will be eliminated, the better. Beritov and Stern are not so dangerous because they oppose to Pavlov openly and thus facilitate the reprisal of science against these amateurs of science... Now something about the tactics of the struggle against the opponents of Academician Pavlov's theory. At first, it is necessary to stealthily collect Academician Pavlov's supporters, organize them, assign roles, and only after this to gather the session of physiologists... where it will be necessary to give decisive battle to the opponents. Without this, it can fail. Remember: the enemy should be firmly beaten, with reliance on complete success."&lt;ref name="Сталин"&gt;{{cite book|last=Сталин|first=Иосиф|chapter=Письмо Ю.А. Жданову 6 октября 1949 года|title=Cочинения. Т.18|year=2006|publisher=Информационно-издательский центр «Союз»|location=Тверь|pages=535–536}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georgy Malenkov]] supervised the organization of the meeting.

== Keynote speeches ==
Four keynote speakers outlined the main topics of the session: [[Sergey Ivanovich Vavilov|Sergey Vavilov]], the President of the USSR Academy of the Sciences; Ivan Petrovich Razenkov, the Vice-President of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences; Konstantin Bykov, the Director of
the General Physiological Department at the Institute of Experimental Medicine; and Anatoly Grigorievitch Ivanov-Smolenskiy, a psychiatrist.&lt;ref name="Pavlovian session"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Windholz 1997"/&gt;

=== Vavilov's speech ===

In his inaugural address, [[Sergey Ivanovich Vavilov|Sergey Vavilov]], praised Stalin and Pavlov for their materialistic approach to the problem of relationship between the material and mental. He stated that Pavlov was a great scientist whom Stalin and the Soviet Government esteemed very highly. Vavilov noted that Soviet physiologists had made great achievements since Pavlov's death, but some did not follow Pavlov's teaching and even attempted a revision of Pavlov's views. Open or concealed opposition to Pavlov's materialistic theory was expected and  quite understandable for bourgeois scientists who suggested that Pavlov's theory of conditioned reflexes should be shelved and only his experimental methods might be useful. However, even Soviet scientists did very little to develop important trends suggested by Pavlov. For example, experts who participated in a broad discussion of materialistic linguistics in [[Pravda]] did not even mention the role of Pavlov's theory in the study of language. Vavilov explained that the goal of the joint session of physiologists and psychiatrists was to conduct "a critical and self-critical examination of how matters stand with regard to the development of Pavlov's legacy in the Soviet Union". He concluded: "There can be no doubt that it is only a return to Pavlov's road that physiology can be most effective, most beneficial to our people and most worthy of the Stalin epoch of the building of Communism. Glory to Pavlov's genius! Long live the leader of peoples, our great scientist and preceptor in all our major undertakings, Comrade Stalin!"

=== Razenkov's speech ===
Ivan Razenkov spoke after Vavilov. He emphasized the importance of opposing the "reactionary idealist trend" in physiology following the example of [[Trofim Lysenko]] who contributed to a "decisive victory" of [[Ivan Vladimirovich Michurin]]'s teachings over [[August Weismann|Weismannism]]-[[Thomas Hunt Morgan|Morganism]]. Razenkov praised Pavlov's contribution to practical medicine and criticized Pavlov's students for not applying the progressive ideas of Pavlov and [[Ivan Sechenov]] to theoretical and practical medicine. He blamed Pavlov's immediate disciples and successors: L.N. Fydorov, the former director of the Institute of Experimental Medicine, Leon Orbeli, the director of the Pavlov Institute of Evolutionary Physiology, Pyotr Anokhin, the head of the Moscow Institute of Physiology, and Aleksey Speransky, the head of the Institute of General and Experimental Pathology. According to Razenkov, these scientists did not fight hard enough to defend Pavlov's materialist theory against the assaults of Western idealist physiologists, such as Sherrington, Lashley and Fulton, and Pavlov's opponents in Russia, such as Beritov. Razenkov also expressed some self-criticism for not conforming with the Party and the Government's expectation of the Academy of Medical Sciences. He informed that the Government had created a new scientific institution, the Institute of Physiology of the Higher Nervous System, to advance Pavlov's teachings, and Pavlov's faithful disciple Konstantin Bykov had been named the director of that institute. Razenkov emphasized the importance of the application of the work conducted by Bykov and his colleagues to clinical practice. He concluded his speech with a praise to the "peerless scientist, Comrade Stalin".

=== Bykov's speech ===
The next keynote speaker, Konstantin Bykov, asserted that medical science must be built on the foundation of correct humanitarian sciences in addition to biology and psychology. He praised the triumph of Michurian biology based on the philosophy of materialism. He also praised the "decisive blow struck at reactionary idealist theories" by Pavlov. Bykov divided the history of physiology and psychology into two periods: idealistic pre-Pavlovian stage and Pavlovian materialistic stage. Bykov condemned the West-European theories of the pre-Pavlovian stage which explained complex nervous phenomena based on idealistic analytical physiology. The authors of these theories failed to recognize class roots of scientific views. According to Bykov, Pavlov made a transition from analytical to synthetic thinking. He discovered a new class of reflexes, conditioned reflexes. He then developed the theory of higher nervous activity. Under the Soviet System, Pavlovian physiology could develop and flourish. However, some of Pavlov's students failed to follow his theory of higher nervous function and instead diverted to irrelevant issues. Even worse, they accepted Western theories. Bykov named Pavlov's disciples who correctly followed the theories of their teacher: Anatoly Ivanov-Smolenskiy and Ezras Asratovich Asratian. Then, he named the ones who deviated from the right path: Orbeli, Anokhin, Speransky and their coworkers. In particular, Orbeli followed idealist sensory theories of [[Ewald Hering]] and [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and even claimed that they had similarities with Pavlov's materialist theory. Orbeli's associates A.G. Ginetsinskiy and A.V. Lebedinskiy wrote a textbook for physicians "Principles of the Physiology in Man and Animals".&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Ginetsinskiy and A.V. Lebedinskiy. Principles of the Physiology in Man and Animals. Leningrad: Gosudarstvennoe Izdatel'stvo Meditsinskoiy Literatury, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; in which they treated Pavlov's results as inferior to Western studies. In Anokhin's case, Bykov noted that, although Anoknin had deviated from Pavlov's ideas when Pavlov was still alive, there was still some hope for him and he might correct his mistakes and contribute to Soviet physiology. Bykov praised the contributions of Pavlov's ideas to medicine, emphasized the importance of following the right direction of Pavlov's teachings and resisting false Western theories. Finally, he spoke about Stalin's work that suggested improvement of science through criticism and self-criticism.

===Ivanov-Smolenskiy's speech===
In his long speech, Anatoly Ivanov-Smolenskiy reviewed of Pavlov's achievements in the development of the theory of higher nervous activity. According to Ivanov-Smolenskiy, Pavlov's contribution to psychiatry was "of immense value" as opposed to the failure of foreign scientists who did not achieve anything important. Ivanov-Smolenskiy then praised some Russian physiologists and condemned the others. He praised L. A. Andreev and M. K. Petrova as the followers of Pavlov's legacy. He accused Anokhin, Kupalov, and Orbeli. Anokhin was blamed for suggesting that Pavlov's theory was isolated from foreign science and needed improvement, for leaning toward Sherrington's concept of integration, and for criticizing Pavlov's conception of cortical inhibition. Kupalov was accused of distorting Pavlov's conceptualization of reflexes. Ivanov-Smolenskiy characterized Orbeli's views of the relation between subjective experience and objective reality as anti-Pavlovian because — unlike Pavlov who believed that subjective, psychological experience was superimposed on the objective experience of the environment — Orbeli separated the subjective and objective and adhered to psychophysiological parallelism. Orbeli was also blamed for diverging from Pavlov's deterministic position on the mechanisms of higher nervous activity.

==Responses==
In the sessions that followed the keynote speeches, a number of speakers continued to attack the accused Pavlovians, and the accused confessed to their errors and expressed apologies.

===Asratian's speech===
Ezras Asratian spoke on June 29. According to him, several Pavlovians failed the expectations of the Communist Party and the Soviet government. In particular, they failed to pursue research in several important fields, for example cortical localization of functions and fixation of inherited conditioned reflexes in the next generation. They also failed to challenge the anti-Pavlovian theories of Western physiologists.

== Consequence ==
{{main|Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union}}
In 1982, M.G. Yaroshevsky, criticizing the Pavlovian session, wrote that, in fact, Ivanov-Smolenskiy and his disciples did nothing but pervert the kernel of Pavlovian teaching, substituting for it a [[mechanistic]] view of the brain activity.&lt;ref name="Homskaya"&gt;{{cite book|last=Homskaya|first=Evgenia|title=Alexander Romanovich Luria: a scientific biography|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-306-46494-2|pages=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fs_UXUTrjIwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA42,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}} These so-called scholars of Pavlov emasculated the ground of his theory and extremely damaged the prospects of Soviet science.&lt;ref name="Homskaya"/&gt;{{rp|42}}

A precursor of later abuses in psychiatry in the Soviet Union and the most somber event in the history of Russian-Soviet psychiatry was the so-called 'Joint Session' of the [[USSR Academy of Medical Sciences]] and the Board of the All-Union Neurologic and Psychiatric Association, held in the name of [[Ivan Pavlov]] in October 1951, considered the matter of several leading neuroscientists and psychiatrists of the time (for example, [[Grunya Sukhareva]], [[Vasily Gilyarovsky]], [[Raisa Golant]], [[Aleksandr Shmaryan]], [[Mikhail Gurevich (psychiatrist)|Mikhail Gurevich]]) who were charged with practicing 'anti-Pavlovian, anti-Marxist, idealistic, reactionary' science damaging to Soviet psychiatry.&lt;ref name="Lavretsky"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lavretsky|first=Helen|title=The Russian Concept of Schizophrenia: A Review of the Literature |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|year=1998|volume=24|issue=4|pages=537–557|pmid=9853788|url=http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/4/537.full.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2011|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.schbul.a033348}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|540}} These talented psychiatrists had to admit publicly to their wrong beliefs and mistakes and promise to profess only Pavlov's teaching.&lt;ref name="Lavretsky"/&gt;{{rp|540}} During the Joint Session, scientists falsely acknowledged their 'wrongdoings' and gave up their beliefs, out of fear.&lt;ref name="Lavretsky"/&gt;{{rp|540}} But in the closing speech, the lead author of the policy report [[Andrei Snezhnevsky]] stated that they "have not disarmed themselves and continue to remain in the old anti-Pavlovian positions", thereby causing "grave damage to the Soviet scientific and practical psychiatry", and the vice president of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences accused them that they "diligently fall down to the dirty source of American pseudo-science".&lt;ref name="Гуревич"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Савенко|first=Юрий|title=Михаил Осипович (Иосифович) Гуревич|journal=Независимый психиатрический журнал|year=2009|issue=№ 3|url=http://www.npar.ru/journal/2009/3/03_gurevic.htm|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fear and less than noble ambitions of the accusers including [[Irina Strelchuk]], [[Vasily Banshchikov]], [[Oleg Kerbikov]], and Andrei Snezhnevsky were also likely to make them serve in the role of inquisitors.&lt;ref name="Lavretsky"/&gt;{{rp|540}} Not surprisingly, many of them were advanced and appointed to leadership positions shortly after the session.&lt;ref name="Lavretsky"/&gt;{{rp|540}}

The Joint Session also affected [[neuroscience]] in such a way that the best neuroscientists of the time, such as academicians [[Pyotr Anokhin]], [[Aleksey Speransky]], [[Lina Stern]], [[Ivan Beritashvili]], and [[Leon Orbeli]], who headed various scientific directions at that time, were labeled as anti-Pavlov, anti-materialist and reactionaries, and discharged from their positions.&lt;ref name="Lavretsky"/&gt;{{rp|540}} These scientists lost their laboratories, and some were subjected to tortures in prisons.&lt;ref name="Lavretsky"/&gt;{{rp|540}} The Moscow, Leningrad, Ukrainian, Georgian, and Armenian schools of neuroscience and neurophysiology were damaged, at least for a while.&lt;ref name="Lavretsky"/&gt;{{rp|540}} The Joint Session ravaged productive research in neurosciences and psychiatry for years to come.&lt;ref name="Lavretsky"/&gt;{{rp|540}} It was pseudoscience that took over.&lt;ref name="Lavretsky"/&gt;{{rp|540}}

After the joint meeting of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences and the USSR Academy of Sciences (Pavlovian Session of 1950), [[pathophysiology]] of [[higher nervous activity]] was established as a new discipline mandatory for all of the USSR psychiatrists who underwent retraining in accordance with this concept. According to the postulates of pathophysiology of higher nervous activity, the development of all mental disorders was explained in terms of the changed relations between the excitation and inhibition, their interference and different phases of the inhibition. Psychological approaches during diagnosing, treating and explaining the mechanisms of mental disorders have been banned and virtually excluded from the practice of psychiatrists. This ban was based on the ideological concept of labeling all psychological theories of personality, especially psychoanalytic ones, as reactionary and idealistic.&lt;ref name="Короленко"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Короленко|first1=Ц.П.|authorlink1=Caesar Korolenko|last2=Дмитриева|first2=Н.В.|title=Социодинамическая психиатрия|year=1999|publisher=НГПУ|location=Новосибирск|url=http://azps.ru/hrest/80/5050550.html|chapter=Психиатрия советского периода}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Physical strength''' is the measure of an [[animal]]'s exertion of [[force]] on [[physical object]]s. Increasing physical strength is the goal of [[strength training]].

==Overview==
An individual's physical strength is determined by two factors; the cross-sectional area of muscle fibers recruited to generate force and the intensity of the recruitment.  Individuals with a high proportion of [[Muscle fibre#Type I|type I]] slow twitch muscle fibers will be relatively weaker than a similar individual with a high proportion of [[Muscle fibre#Type II|type II]] fast twitch fibers, but would have a greater inherent capacity for physical endurance.  The genetic inheritance of muscle fiber type sets the outermost boundaries of physical strength possible (barring the use of enhancing agents such as testosterone), though the unique position within this envelope is determined by training.  Individual muscle fiber ratios can be determined through a muscle biopsy. Other considerations are the ability to recruit muscle fibers for a particular activity, joint angles, and the length of each limb. For a given cross-section, shorter limbs are able to lift more weight. The ability to gain muscle also varies person to person, based mainly upon genes dictating the amounts of hormones secreted, but also on sex, age, health of the person, and adequate nutrients in the diet.  A [[one-repetition maximum]] test is the most accurate way to determine maximum muscular strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hprc-online.org/physical-fitness/training-exercise/exercise/muscular-fitness-and-flexibility/muscular-strength|title=Muscular Strength — Human Performance Resource Center|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ahealthyphilosophy.com/article/muscular-strength|title=Muscular Strength|publisher=}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strength capability==
There are various ways to measure physical strength of a person or population. Strength capability analysis is usually done in the field of [[ergonomics]] where a particular task (e.g. lifting a load, pushing a cart, etc.) and/or a posture is evaluated and compared to the capabilities of the section of the population that the task is intended towards. The external reactive [[torque|moments]] and forces on the joints are usually used in such cases. The strength capability of the joint is denoted by the amount of moment that the muscle force can create at the joint to counter the external moment.

Skeletal muscles produce reactive forces and moments at the joints. To avoid injury or fatigue, when person is performing a task, such as pushing or lifting a load, the external moments created at the joints due to the load at the hand and the weight of the body segments must be ideally less than the muscular moment strengths at the joint.

One of the first [[sagittal plane|sagittal-plane]] models to predict strength was developed by Chaffin in 1969.&lt;ref name = Chaffin&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Chaffin DB, Andersson GB, Martin BJ |title= Occupational Biomechanics, 3rd Edition |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |location=New York |year=1999 |pages= |isbn=0-471-24697-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on this model, the external moments at each joint must not exceed the muscle strength moments at that joint.

'''&lt;center&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;j/L&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;'''

Where, S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; is the muscle strength moment at joint, j, and M&lt;sub&gt;j/L&lt;/sub&gt; is the external moment at the joint, j, due to load, L and the body segments preceding the joint in the top-down analysis.

Top-down analysis is the method of calculating the reactive moments and forces at each joint starting at the hand, all the way till the ankle and foot. In a 6-segment model, the joints considered are elbow, shoulder, L5/S1 [[vertebral column|disc of the spine]], hip, knee and ankle. It is common to ignore the wrist joint in manual calculations. Software intended for such calculation use the wrist joint also, dividing the lower arm into hand and forearm segments.

==Prediction of static strength==
Static strength prediction is the method of predicting the strength capabilities of a person or a population (based on anthropometry) for a particular task and/or posture (an [[Isometric exercise|isometric contraction]]). Manual calculations are usually performed using the top-down analysis on a six or seven-link model, based on available information about the case and then compared to standard guidelines, such as the one provided by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], to predict capability.

The '''Piscina Mirabilis''' is an [[ancient Roman]] [[cistern]] on the [[Bacoli]] hill at the western end of the [[Gulf of Naples]], southern Italy. It was one of the largest ancient cisterns &lt;ref name=naplesldm&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naplesldm.com/aqueduct.htm#pm |title=The Piscina mirabilis |website=Naples: Life, Death, and Miracles |accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was situated there in order to provide the Roman western imperial fleet at [[Portus Julius]] with drinking water.&lt;ref name=napoli&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.napoliunderground.org/index.php/it/escursionismo/itinerari/532-piscina-mirabilis |title=Napoli Underground - Piscina Mirabilis |date=2 March 2015 |accessdate=28 February 2016 |language=IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cistern was dug entirely out of the [[tuff]] hill and was {{convert|15|m|ft}} high, {{convert|72|m|ft}} long, and {{convert|25|m|ft}} wide. The capacity was {{convert|12,600|m3|ft3}}.&lt;ref name=naplesldm /&gt; It was supported by [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] ceilings and a total of 48 pillars. It was supplied with water from the main Roman aqueduct, the [[Aqua Augusta (Naples)|Aqua Augusta]], which brought water from sources in [[Serino]] near [[Avellino]], 100 kilometres  distant, to most of the sites around [[Naples]].&lt;ref name=naplesldm /&gt;

The ancient cistern is currently in private hands, but it may be visited by the public.&lt;ref name=napoli /&gt;

Implementing '''[https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/what-is-positive-psychology-definition/ positive psychology in the workplace]''' means creating an environment that is relatively enjoyable and productive. This also means creating a work schedule that does not lead to emotional and physical distress.

== Overview ==
Positive psychology in the workplace is about shifting attention away from negative aspects such as work violence, stress, burnout, and job insecurity.  Through the employment of positive psychology, a working environment with a goal of promoting positive [[affect (psychology)|affect]] in its employees can be created.

Fun should not be looked at as something that cannot be achieved during work but rather as a motivation factor for the staff. Along this line, it is important to examine the role of: helping behaviors, team building exercises, job resources, job security and work support.

The emerging field of positive psychology also helps to creatively manage organizational behaviors and to increase productivity in the workplace through applying positive organizational forces.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew J. Martin,"The Role of Positive Psychology in Enhancing Satisfaction, Motivation, and Productivity in the Workplace", ''University of Western Sydney'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [https://ac.els-cdn.com/S2212567115005249/1-s2.0-S2212567115005249-main.pdf?_tid=28d0c67c-0fed-4ac8-9427-7922223a1bf2&amp;acdnat=1528124041_9f693294307226eb549b3cd6894ad089 Recent researches on job satisfaction] and [[employee retention]] have created a great need to focus on implementing positive psychology in the workplace.

==Background==
According to the [[United States Department of Labor]], “In 2009 employed persons worked an average of 7.5 hours on the days they worked, which were mostly weekdays. [In addition to that], 84 percent of employed persons did some or all of their work at their workplace.[1]” &lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Labor Bureau of Statistics.”American Time Use Survey”. June 2010. http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.nr0.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates that majority of the population spend their waking hours at work, outside their homes. Therefore, employers must do their best to create a low stress and inspiring work environment to yield greater productivity.

Michelle T. Iaffaldano and Paul M. Muchinsky were among the first people to ignite interest in the connection between [[job satisfaction]] and job performance. The meta-analytic research of these individuals impacted the way in which later research on the topic was conducted, especially regarding sample sizes.&lt;ref&gt;Iaffaldano M.T., &amp; Muchinsky P.M (1985). Job satisfaction and job performance: A meta-analysis. Psychological Bulletin, 97, 251-273&lt;/ref&gt;

.

== Major theoretical approaches ==
[[Martin E.P. Seligman]] and [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] are noted frontrunners in the area of positive psychology as a field of study. They state that “psychology has become a science largely about healing. Therefore its concentration on healing largely neglects the fulfilled individual and thriving community”.&lt;ref name="Seligman_and_Csikszentmihalyi"&gt;Seligman, M. E. P., &amp; Csikszentmihalyi, M. (2000). Positive psychology: An introduction. ''American Psychologist'', 55, 5–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi further stress that, “the aim of positive psychology is to begin to catalyze a change in the focus of psychology from preoccupation only with repairing the worst things in life to also building positive qualities.”&lt;ref name="Seligman_and_Csikszentmihalyi" /&gt;

[[Abraham Maslow]] and [[Carl Rogers]] developed [[Humanistic Psychology]] that focuses on the positive potential of people and on helping people reach their full potential.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, D. L., Gilbert, D. T., &amp; Wegner, D. M. (2009). Psychology: The evolution of a science. Psychology (p. 1.10). New York: Worth Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Warr]] is noted for his early work on work well being. “Proponents of the well-being perspective argue that the presence of positive emotional states and positive appraisals of the worker and his or her relationships within the workplace accentuate worker performance and quality of life”.&lt;ref&gt;Harter, J., Schmidt, F., &amp; Keyes, C. 2003. Well-being in the workplace and its relationship to business outcomes: A review of the Gallup studies. In C. Keyes &amp; J. Haidt (eds.), Flourishing:
Positive psychology and the life well-lived: 205-224. Washington, DC: American Psychological
Association.&lt;/ref&gt; A common idea in work environment theories is that demands match or slightly exceed the resources. With regards to research concerning positive outcomes within the employment setting, several models have been established like ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2952960/ Demand Control]'', ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4628698/ Job Demands-Resources]'', and ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4306429/ Job Characteristics]''.

===Demand control model===
Robert A. Karasek is credited with this particular work design model. In Karasek’s model, workplace stress is in indicator of how taxing a worker's job is and how much control, authority, discretion, and decision latitude the worker has over his/her tasks and duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Stress: Myth, theory and research|last=Jones|first=F.|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2001|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates four kinds of jobs—passive, active, low strain and high strain  [http://paei.wikidot.com/karasek-demand-control-model-of-job-stress The Demand Control Model] (DCM) has been used by researchers to design jobs that enhance the psychological and physical well-being.&lt;ref name="Turner N. 2002 pp. 715"&gt;Turner N., Barling J., &amp; Zacharatos A. (2002). Positive psychology at work. In C. R. Snyder &amp; S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Handbook of positive psychology (pp. 715–728). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This model promotes a work design that proposes high demand and high control, fostering an environment that encourages learning and simultaneously offers autonomy.

This model is based on the assumption that “workers with active jobs are more likely to seek challenging situations that promote mastery, thereby encouraging skill and knowledge acquisition”.&lt;ref&gt;Turner N., Barling J., &amp; Zacharatos A. (2002). Positive psychology at work. In C. R. Snyder &amp; S. J. Lopez (Eds.), ''Handbook of positive psychology'' (pp. 715–728). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It also points out the role of social support, referring to the quality interactions between colleagues and managers.&lt;ref&gt;Ruckenbiel J. (2013).Gesundheit, Arbeit und Zusammenhalt (pp. 93-122).Freiburg: Centaurus Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is some controversy over this model because some researchers &lt;ref&gt;Toon W. Taris (2006). Bricks without clay: On urban myths in occupational health psychology. Work &amp; Stress Vol. 20, Iss. 2..&lt;/ref&gt; believe it lacks evidence for the interaction between demand and control.

The DCM is commonly criticized for its inability to consistently replicate findings to support its basic assumption. The DCM has been criticized{{By whom|date=June 2012}} for “its simplicity, inability to capture the complexity of work environments.However, there is evidence supporting the idea that “high amounts of [[Job control (workplace)|job control]] is associated with increases in job satisfaction and decreased depression, however, high demands with out adequate control may lead to increase anxiety”.&lt;ref name="Turner N. 2002 pp. 715" /&gt;

===Job demands-resources===
The [[Job Demands-Resources model|job demands-resources model]] (JD-R) is an expansion of the DCM and is founded on the same principle that high job demands and high job resources produce employees with more positive work attitudes. The difference between the JD-R and DCM is that the JD-R expounds upon the differentiation between demand and resources, as well as encompasses a broader view of resources. This model refers to demands as “ those physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job that require sustained physical and/or psychological effort.&lt;ref name="Bakker, A. 2010"&gt;Bakker, A. (2010). Psychosocial safety climate as a precursor to conducive work environments, psychological health problems, and employee engagement.  Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 83(3), 795-814.&lt;/ref&gt; This may refer to jobs that require contact with customers. Resources are regarded as “those physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job that are either/or: (1) functional in achieving work goals; (2) reduce job demands and the associated physiological and psychological costs; and (3) stimulate personal growth, learning, and development”.&lt;ref name="Bakker, A. 2010"/&gt; Another difference between these two theories is that the JD-R postulates that resources can be predictors of motivation and learning related outcomes. The findings by Bakker and colleagues supports their hypothesis that many resources may be linked to job well-being. They also found that “task enjoyment and organizational commitment are the result of combinations of many different job demands and job resources. Enjoyment and commitment were high when employees were confronted with challenging and stimulating tasks, and simultaneously had sufficient resources at their disposal”.&lt;ref name="Bakker, A. 2010"/&gt;

===Job characteristics model===
The [[job characteristics model]] (JCM) is “an influential theory of work design developed by Hackman and Oldham. It is based upon five characteristics - skill variety, task identity, task significance, task autonomy, and task feedback - which are used to identify the general content and structure of jobs”.&lt;ref name="Turner N. 2002 pp. 715"/&gt; This model argues that employees with a personal need for growth and development, as well as knowledge and skill, will display more positive work outcomes. These include things such as: job satisfaction, lower absenteeism, and better work turnover. This model is based upon an idea that high task control and feedback are two essential elements for maximizing work potential. Stronger experiences of these five traits is said to lead to greater job satisfaction and better performance.&lt;ref name="Turner N. 2002 pp. 715"/&gt;

==Empirical evidence==

===Safety===

In order to protect the physical and mental health of workers, the demands of the job must be balanced by easily accessible job resources in order to prevent [[Occupational burnout|burnout]] in employees yet encourage [[employee engagement]].&lt;ref&gt;Nahrgang, J.D., Morgeson, F.P., &amp; Hofman, D.A. (2011). Safety at work: A meta-analytic investigation of the link between job demands, job resources, burnout, engagement, and safety outcomes. Journal of Applied Psychology, 96(1), 71-94&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction between the demand and resources within a job determines employee engagement or burnout. Engagement signifies a positive employee who is committed to the safety within the workplace for self and others. In contrast, burnout represents a negative employee possessing elements of anxiety, depression, and work-related stress. Engagement increases as job resources like knowledge of safety are present. On the other hand, burnout increases when more job demands are present without the buffering effects of job resources.

Hazards in the workplace can be seen as a combination of the physical demands of the work and the complexity of the work. Job resources provide a buffering effect that protects the employees from job demands like high work pressure, an unfavorable physical environment, and emotionally demanding interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Nahrgang, J.D., Morgeson, F.P., &amp; Hofman, D.A. (2011). Safety at work: A meta-analytic investigation of the link between job demands, job resources, burnout, engagement, and safety outcomes. Journal of Applied Psychology, 96(1), 71-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Employees are better equipped to handle changes in their work environment when resources are readily available.&lt;ref&gt;Wanberg, C. R., &amp; Banas, J. T. (2000). Predictors and outcomes of openness to changes in a reorganizing workplace. Journal of Applied Psychology, 85: 132-142.&lt;/ref&gt; The resources a job can provide include [[autonomy]], support, and knowledge of safety. Autonomy allows employees the freedom to decide how to execute their work. Support can originate directly from a supervisor or from other workers in the environment. And lastly, employees must have knowledge about safety procedures and policies. When the employee is able to work in a safe environment, workers are more satisfied with their jobs. A safe environment provides support and resources that promote healthy employees.

===Emotion, attitude and mood===

[[Emotional intelligence]] is the ability to recognize, and interpret emotions that can be used to regulate emotions and assist cognitive processes which promote emotional and intellectual growth.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, J. D., Salovey, P., &amp; Caruso, D. R. (2004). Emotional intelligence: Theory, findings, and implications. Psychological Inquiry, 15, 197–215.&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional intelligence has been researched by Carmelli (2003) in order to see its effect on employees work performance.&lt;ref&gt;Carmelli, A. (2003). The relationship between emotional intelligence and work attitudes, behavior and outcomes. Journal of Managerial Psychology, 18, 788–813.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the social nature of the interactions of the employees, emotional intelligence is essential in order to work well with co-workers. When employees work well together their task performance improves and as a result the business benefits. With emotional intelligence, employees are better able to perceive others needing help and are more willing to help for intrinsic benefits.

Isen &amp; Reeve (2005) proposed that positive [[affect (psychology)|affect]] led to positive intrinsic [[motivation]] for completing a task.&lt;ref&gt;Isen, A. M., &amp; Reeve, J. (2005). The influence of positive affect on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation: Facilitating enjoyment of play, responsible work behavior, and self-control. Motivation and Emotion, 29, 295–323.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the intrinsic motivation, the employees enjoyed the task more and were more optimistic when having to complete more uninteresting task. The combination of having the freedom to choose tasks and maintaining positive affect results in better task performance. Positive affect promotes self-control to remain focused on any task and forward-looking thinking that motivates workers to look-forward to more enjoyable tasks.

Concepts of [[positive psychology]] like hope and [[altruism]] provide a positive work environment that influences the moods and attitudes of workers. Youssef &amp; Luthans (2007) examined the effects hope, optimism, and [[Psychological resilience|resilience]] had in the workplace on employees’ job performance, job satisfaction, [[Happiness at work|work happiness]], and organizational commitment.&lt;ref&gt;Youssef, C. M., &amp; Luthans, F. (2007). Positive organizational behavior in the workplace: The impact of hope, optimism, and resilience. Journal of Management, 33: 774-800.&lt;/ref&gt; Hope and resilience had a more direct effect on organizational commitment whereas hope had a greater impact on performance. Hope allows employees to be better at creating more realistic plans for completing task so as not to focus on the failure that accompanies an incomplete task. Optimism strengthens the employee’s resilience to break through barriers and causes the employee to build social support and other strengths to overcome obstacle he or she may encounter.

Positive psychology also encourages maintaining positive mood in the work environment to encourage productivity on an individual level and organizational level. [[Organizational citizenship behavior]]s (OCB) refer to behaviors like altruism and [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] that are not formal tasks in that the behaviors are not a mandatory of the workers job description. They are considered extra-role behaviors that help in gauging the workers commitment to the job and to the rules of the job in the absence of monitoring these behaviors. OCB have proven to improve the moods of employees and the moods in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Glomb, T.M., Bhave, D.P., Miner, A.G., &amp; Wall, M. (2011). Doing good, feeling good: Examining the role of organizational citizenship behaviors in changing mood. Personnel Psychology, 64(1), 191-223.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[helping behavior]] improves mood because the individual is no longer focused of negative moods; helping others acts as a distracter for the employee. Altruism is effective because it has more impact in a social setting like the workplace and is more extrinsically rewarding. OCB encourage positive interactions among workers and lead to better psychological health for employees.

According to Froman (2010), having a more hopeful perspective about life leads one to being more optimistic about responding to opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Froman, L. (2010). Positive psychology in the workplace. Journal of Adult Development, 17: 59-69.&lt;/ref&gt; Workers are more resilient to adversity and are able to bounce back more quickly. When organizations encourage positive attitudes in their employees, they grow and [[flourishing|flourish]]. As a result, the organization profits and grows from the human capital of productive employees and the monetary capital resulting from productive workers.

===Fun===

Chan (2010) studied fun activities in the workplace that created a positive work environment that could retain and attract employees and encourage employee well-being.&lt;ref name="Chan S.C.H. 2010"&gt;Chan S.C.H., (2010) Does workplace fun matter? Developing a useable (sic) typology of workplace fun in a qualitative study. International Journal of Hospitality Management, 29(4), 720-728.&lt;/ref&gt; Activities must be enjoyable and pleasurable. The activities also encourage employees to be more responsible and a team player. These qualities empower employees to more engaged with their work, take on more leadership roles, and experience less stress. Making work fun promotes positive, happy moods in employees that in turn increase job satisfaction and organizational commitment. According to Chan’s framework, workplace fun must be staff-oriented, supervisor-oriented, social-oriented, or strategy oriented.&lt;ref name="Chan S.C.H. 2010"/&gt; While staff-oriented activities focus on creating fun work for employees, supervisor-oriented activities create a better relationship between the employees and supervisors.  Social-oriented activities create social events that are organizational-based (i.e. company barbecue or Christmas office party). Strategy-oriented activities allow more autonomy with employees in different aspects of their work in hopes of cultivating strengths within the organization’s employees. The framework proposes that a fun work environment promotes employee well-being in addition to fostering creativity, enthusiasm, satisfaction and communication among the organization’s employees. The research found in this study hopes to encourage implementing other work fun activities in other various industries in order to engage and retain positive employees.

==Appliance==

There are several examples of popular, real-world uses of infusing Positive Psychology in the workplace. In such contexts such as a workplace, researchers often hope to examine and measure variable levels of such factors such as productivity and organization. One such popular model is the aforementioned Job Characteristics Model (JCM), which applies influential theories of work as it correlates to the five central characteristics of skill variety, task identity, task significance, task autonomy, and task feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Turner N., Barling J., &amp; Zacharatos A. (2002). Positive psychology at work. In
C. R. Snyder &amp; S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Handbook of positive psychology (pp. 715–728). New
York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, such practices such as business teams within a workplace often present the varying dynamics of positivity and negativity in business behaviors. There are often a plethora of special research teams that go into looking at certain workplaces in order to help report to employers the status of their employees. Furthermore, the three psychological states often measured and examined are: meaningfulness of performed work, responsibility of outcomes, and results knowledge. In mixing together these aspects, a score is generated in order to observe a range reflecting a job quality. In addition, each score details the differing degrees of autonomy and necessary feedback as it relates to ensuring high quality work. Most research points to the fact that typical teams of high performance are those that function high on positivity in their workplace behaviors.

==Controversies==

Adequate research regarding whether the practice of measuring factors, such as positive behaviors is lacking. More specifically, in attempting to measure some form of a variable in order to later ensure a positive environment context in the workplace, there is debate to an extent regarding which proper components to value and measure. Additionally, the act and process of specifically looking into certain factors of productivity in the workplace can also go on to influence workers negatively due to pressure.

==Conclusion==

The multitudes of research and new, developing information detailing the possibility of positive psychology at work often deals with reporting [[occupational safety and health|workplace safety]], the engagement of the employees, productivity, and overall happiness.&lt;ref&gt;Turner N., Barling J., &amp; Zacharatos A. (2002). Positive psychology at work. In C. R. Snyder &amp; S. J. Lopez (Eds.), Handbook of positive psychology (pp. 715–728). New
York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, understanding the significance of a healthy work environment can directly provide and contribute to work mastery and work ethic. Motivation, researchers have learned, helps to keep a reinforced sense of both discipline and a higher perception which then yields to higher levels of efficiency for both employees and employers.

'''[[Quaternary compound|Quaternary]] ammonium cations''', also known as '''quats''', are positively charged [[polyatomic ion]]s of the structure {{chem|NR|4|+}}, R being an [[alkyl]] group or an [[aryl]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef | file = Q05003 | title = quaternary ammonium compounds }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[ammonium|ammonium ion]] ({{chem|NH|4|+}}) and the primary, secondary, or tertiary ammonium [[cations]], the quaternary ammonium cations are permanently charged, independent of the [[pH]] of their solution. '''Quaternary ammonium salts''' or '''quaternary ammonium compounds''' (called '''quaternary amines''' in [[oilfield]] parlance) are [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s of quaternary ammonium cations.

== Synthesis ==
Quaternary ammonium compounds are prepared by the [[alkylation]] of [[tertiary amine]]s with a [[halocarbon]].&lt;ref name=OS&gt;{{cite journal|title=o-Methylethylbenzyl Alcohol||authors=W. R. Brasen, C. R. Hauser|journal=Org. Synth.|year=1954|volume=34|page=58|doi=10.15227/orgsyn.034.0058}}&lt;/ref&gt; In older literature this is often called a [[Menshutkin reaction]], however modern chemists usually refer to it simply as '''quaternization'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1= Smith|first1= Michael B.|author2-link= Jerry March|last2=March |first2=Jerry | year = 2001 | title = Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure | edition = 5th | location = New York, NY | publisher = Wiley-Interscience | isbn = 0-471-58589-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction can be used to produce a compound with unequal alkyl chain lengths; for example when making [[Surfactant#Cationic head groups|cationic surfactants]] one of the alkyl groups on the amine is typically longer than the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ullmann|last=Kosswig|first=K.|title=Surfactants|doi=10.1002/14356007.a25_747}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical synthesis is for [[benzalkonium chloride]] from a long-chain alkyldimethylamine and [[benzyl chloride]]:

:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;N(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ClCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; → [CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;N(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

==Reactions==
Quaternary ammonium cations are unreactive toward even strong [[electrophile]]s, [[oxidant]]s, and [[acid]]s. They also are stable toward most [[nucleophile]]s. The latter is indicated by the stability of the [[hydroxide]] salts such as [[tetramethylammonium hydroxide]] and [[tetrabutylammonium hydroxide]]. Because of their resilience, many unusual anions have been isolated as the quaternary ammonium salts. Examples include [[tetramethylammonium pentafluoroxenate]], containing the highly reactive pentafluoroxenate ({{chem|XeF|5|−}}) ion. [[Permanganate]] can be solubilized in organic solvents, when deployed as its {{chem|N[[butyl|Bu]]|4|+}} salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Purple benzene: Solubilization of anions in organic solvents | first= Arthur W.|last= Herriott | journal = J. Chem. Educ. | year = 1977 | volume = 54 | issue = 4 | page = 229 | doi = 10.1021/ed054p229.1| bibcode = 1977JChEd..54Q.229H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Doheny |first1=Anthony J., Jr. |last2=Ganem |first2=Bruce  | title = Purple benzene revisited | journal = J.

With exceptionally strong bases, quat cations degrade. They undergo [[Sommelet–Hauser rearrangement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth | collvol = 4 | collvolpages = 585 | year = 1963 | title = 2-Methylbenzyldimethylamine | first1 = W. R.|last1= Brasen | first2 = C.

Quaternary ammonium cations containing N–C–C–H units can also undergo the [[Hofmann elimination]] and [[Emde degradation]].

[[Image:Benzalkonium chloride Structure V.1.svg|thumb|[[Benzalkonium chloride]] is a common type of quat salt used as a [[biocide]], a [[cationic]] [[surfactant]], and as a [[phase transfer agent]].&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Lackner, Josef Peter Guggenbichler "Antimicrobial Surfaces" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2013.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.q03_q01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ADBACs are a [[mixture]] of alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chlorides, in which the alkyl group has various even-numbered alkyl chain lengths.]]
==Applications==
Quaternary ammonium salts are used as [[disinfectant]]s, [[surfactants]], [[fabric softener]]s, and as [[antistatic agent]]s (e.g. in [[shampoo]]s). In [[liquid]] fabric softeners, the [[chloride]] salts are often used. In [[clothes dryer|dryer]] [[fabric softener|anticling]] strips, the [[sulfate]] salts are often used. [[Spermicide|Spermicidal jellies]] also contain quaternary ammonium salts.

===As antimicrobials===
Quaternary ammonium compounds have also been shown to have antimicrobial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0008-6215(01)00112-4 | title = Synthesis and antibacterial activities of quaternary ammonium salt of chitosan | year = 2001 | last1 = Jia | first1 = Zhishen | last2 = Shen | first2 = Dongfeng | last3 = Xu | first3 = Weiliang | journal = Carbohydrate Res. | volume = 333 | pages = 1–6 | pmid = 11423105 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain quaternary ammonium compounds, especially those containing long alkyl chains, are used as [[antimicrobial]]s and [[disinfectant]]s. Examples are [[benzalkonium chloride]], [[benzethonium chloride]], methylbenzethonium chloride, [[cetalkonium chloride]], [[cetylpyridinium chloride]], [[cetrimonium]], [[cetrimide]], dofanium chloride, [[tetraethylammonium bromide]], [[didecyldimethylammonium chloride]] and domiphen bromide. Also good against [[fungi]], [[amoebas]], and [[viral envelope|enveloped]] [[viruses]],&lt;ref name=questionable&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mansfield.ohio-state.edu/~sabedon/biol2032.htm |title=Specific Antimicrobials |first=Stephen T. |last=Abedon |publisher=Ohio State University |access-date=December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015002934/http://www.mansfield.ohio-state.edu/~sabedon/biol2032.htm |archivedate=2008-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; quaternary ammonium compounds are believed to act by disrupting the [[cell membrane]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Quaternary ammonium compounds are lethal to a wide variety of organisms except [[endospores]], ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' and [[non-enveloped virus]]es.

Quaternary ammonium compounds are cationic [[detergent]]s, as well as [[disinfectant]]s, and as such can be used to remove organic material. They are very effective in combination with [[phenol]]s. Quaternary ammonium compounds are deactivated by anionic detergents (including common soaps). Also, they work best in [[Water hardness|soft water]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Effective levels are at 200&amp;nbsp;ppm. They are effective at temperatures up to {{convert|100|C|F|abbr=on}}.

Quaternary ammonium salts are commonly used in the [[foodservice]] industry as sanitizing agents.

===Phase transfer catalysts===
In organic chemistry, quaternary ammonium salts are employed as [[phase transfer catalyst]]s (PTCs). Such catalysts accelerate reactions between reagents dissolved in immiscible solvents. The highly reactive reagent [[dichlorocarbene]] is generated via PTC by reaction of [[chloroform]] and aqueous [[sodium hydroxide]].
[[File:Ion exchange resin beads.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Anion exchange]] resins, in the form of beads, contain quaternary ammonium ions bound to a polymer.]]

===Fabric softeners===
In the 1950s, [[distearyldimethylammonium chloride]] (DHTDMAC), was introduced as a [[fabric softener]]. This compound was discontinued because the cation biodegrades too slowly. Contemporary fabric softeners are based on salts of quaternary ammonium cations where the fatty acid is linked to the quaternary center via ester linkages; these are commonly referred to as [[betaine]]-esters or ester-quats and are susceptible to degradation, e.g., by [[hydrolysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hellberg|first1=Per-Erik|last2=Bergström|first2=Karin|last3=Holmberg|first3=Krister|title=Cleavable surfactants|journal=J.

===Plant growth retardants===
[[Chlormequat|Cycocel]] (chlormequat chloride) reduces plant height by inhibiting the production of [[gibberellin]]s, the primary plant hormones responsible for cell elongation. Therefore, their effects are primarily on stem, petiole and flower stalk tissues. Lesser effects are seen in reductions of leaf expansion, resulting in thicker leaves with darker green color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.in.gr/dimpet/thesis/growth_retardants.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 19, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925004831/http://users.in.gr/dimpet/thesis/growth_retardants.htm |archivedate=September 25, 2011 }} Wageningen Agricultural University, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantification===
The quantification of [[quaternary ammonium compounds]] in environmental and biological samples is problematic using conventional chromatography techniques because the compounds are highly soluble in water. While analyzing them by [[liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry]] it has been found that they follow an exception rule. Under standard [[electrospray ionization]] (ESI) conditions, mono- and di-quaternary ammonium compounds form molecular ions with the formula of ''{{sfrac|m&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;|z&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;}}'' rather than {{sfrac|''m'' + ''z''|''z''}}.{{clarify|reason=variables should be defined|date=August 2014}} Formation of {{sfrac|''m&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;''|2}} is observed for di-quaternary ammonium compounds (like [[diquat]]) as precursor ion and {{sfrac|''m&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;''|1}} as product ion due to the loss of one of the quaternary charge during CID. In di-quaternary ammonium compounds, this process can also result in the formation of fragment ions with higher mass as compared to their precursor ion. [[Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography|Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographic]] separation has been reported to demonstrate a successful separation of quaternary ammonium compounds for their quantification in ESI-MS/MS with higher precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi =10.1080/00032719.2012.693140 |date= October 2012 |first1=Thirumurthy |last1=Velpandiana |first2=Jayabalan |last2=Nirmala |first3=Beauty |last3=Aroraa |first4=Alok Kumar |last4=Ravia |first5=Ankita |last5=Kotnalaa |title=Understanding the Charge Issues in Mono and Di-Quaternary Ammonium Compounds for Their Determination by LC/ESI-MS/MS |volume=45 |issue=16 |pages=2367–2376 |journal=Anal.

'''Scrotal''' (or '''transscrotal''') '''ultrasound''' is a [[medical ultrasound]] examination of the [[scrotum]]. It is used in the evaluation of [[testicular pain]], and can help identify solid masses.&lt;ref name="GrahamKeane2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sam D. Graham|author2=Thomas E Keane|title=Glenn's Urologic Surgery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GahMzaKgMKAC&amp;pg=PA433|accessdate=1 July 2011|date=25 September 2009|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-9141-0|pages=433–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indications==
Although the development of new imaging modality such as computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have open a new era for medical imaging, high resolution sonography remains as the initial imaging modality of choice for evaluation of scrotal
disease. Many of the disease processes, such as testicular torsion, epididymo-orchitis, and intratesticular tumor, produce the common symptom of pain at presentation, and differentiation of these conditions and disorders is important for determining the
appropriate treatment. High resolution ultrasound helps in better characterize some of the intrascrotal lesions, and suggest a more specific diagnosis, resulting in more appropriate treatments and avoiding unnecessary operation for some of the diseases.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"&gt;Content originally copied from: {{cite journal|last1=Mak|first1=Chee-Wai|last2=Tzeng|first2=Wen-Sheng|title=Sonography of the Scrotum|year=2012|doi=10.5772/27586}} from {{cite web|url=https://www.intechopen.com/books/sonography/sonography-of-the-scrotum||title=Sonography|author=Kerry Thoirs}} {{ISBN|978-953-307-947-9}}, Published: February 3, 2012, under the [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ CC-BY-3.0 license].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imaging technique==
For any scrotal examination, thorough palpation of the scrotal contents and history taking
should precede the sonographic examination. Patients are usually examined in the supine
position with a towel draped over his thighs to support the scrotum. Warm gel should
always be used because cold gel can elicit a cremasteric response resulting in thickening of
the scrotal wall; hence a thorough examination is difficult to be performed. A high
resolution, near-focused, linear array transducer with a frequency of 7.5 MHz or greater is
often used because it provides increased resolutions of the scrotal contents. Images of both
scrotum and bilateral inguinal regions are obtained in both transverse and longitudinal
planes. Color Doppler and pulsed Doppler examination is subsequently performed,
optimized to display low-flow velocities, to demonstrate blood flow in the testes and
surrounding scrotal structures. In evaluation of acute scrotum, the asymptomatic side
should be scanned first to ensure that the flow parameters are set appropriately. A
transverse image including all or a portion of both testicles in the field of view is obtained to
allow side-to-side comparison of their sizes, echogenicity, and vascularity. Additional views
may also be obtained with the patient performing Valsalva maneuver.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

==Anatomy==
[[File:Ultrasonography of a normal epididymal head.jpg|thumb|Normal epididymal head. The epididymal head, usually iso- or slightly hyperechoic than the testis is seen located cephalad to the testis.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;]]

The normal adult testis is an ovoid structure measuring 3 cm in anterior-posterior
dimension, 2–4 cm in width, and 3–5 cm in length. The weight of each testis normally ranges
from 12.5 to 19 g. Both the sizes and weights of the testes normally decrease with age. At
ultrasound, the normal testis has a homogeneous, medium-level, granular echotexture. The
testicle is surrounded by a dense white fibrous capsule, the tunica albuginea, which is often
not visualized in the absence of intrascrotal fluid. However, the tunica is often seen as an
echogenic structure where it invaginates into the testis to form the mediastinum testis. In the testis, the seminiferous tubules converge to form the rete testes, which is
located in the mediastinum testis. The rete testis connects to the epididymal head via the
efferent ductules. The epididymis is located posterolateral to the testis and measures 6–7 cm
in length. At sonography, the epididymis is normally iso- or slightly hyperechoic to the
normal testis and its echo texture may be coarser. The head is the largest and most easily
identified portion of the epididymis. It is located superior-lateral to the upper pole of the
testicle and is often seen on paramedian views of the testis. The normal epididymal
body and tail are smaller and more variable in position.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

The testis obtains its blood supply from the deferential, cremasteric and testicular arteries.
The right and left testicular arteries, branches of the abdominal aorta, arise just distal to the
renal arteries, provide the primary vascular supply to the testes. They course through the
inguinal canal with the spermatic cord to the posterior superior aspect of the testis. Upon
reaching the testis, the testicular artery divides into branches, which penetrate the tunica
albuginea and arborize over the surface of the testis in a layer known as tunica vasculosa.
Centripetal branches arising from the capsular arteries carry blood toward the mediastinum,
where they divide to form the recurrent rami that carry blood away from the mediastinum
into the testis. The deferential artery, a branch of the superior vesicle artery and the
cremasteric artery, a branch of the inferior epigastric artery, supply the epididymis, vas
deferens, and peritesticular tissue.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

[[File:Ultrasonography of an appendix on a testicle in a hydrocele.jpg|thumb|Scrotal ultrasonography with [[Doppler ultrasound|Doppler]] of an 85 year old man with [[hydrocele]], making the [[appendix of the testicle]] clearly distinctive as a 4 mm outpouching.]]

Four testicular appendages have been described: the [[appendix testis]], the appendix
epididymis, the vas aberrans, and the paradidymis. They are all remnants of embryonic
ducts. Among them, the appendix testis and the appendix epididymis are usually seen at scrotal US. The appendix testis is a
mullerian duct remnant and consists of fibrous tissue and blood vessels within an envelope
of columnar epithelium. The appendix testis is attached to the upper pole of the testis and
found in the groove between the testis and the epididymis. The appendix epididymis is
attached to the head of the epididymis. The spermatic cord, which begins at the deep
inguinal ring and descends vertically into the scrotum consists of vas deferens, testicular
artery, cremasteric artery, deferential artery, pampiniform plexuses, genitofemoral nerve,
and lymphatic vessel.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

==Intratesticular tumors==
One of the primary indications for scrotal sonography is to evaluate for the presence of
intratesticular tumor in the setting of scrotal enlargement or a palpable abnormality at
physical examination. It is well known that the presence of a solitary intratesticular solid
mass is highly suspicious for malignancy. Conversely, the vast majority of extratesticular
lesions are benign.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

===Germ cell tumors===
Primary intratesticular malignancy can be divided into germ cell tumors and non–germ cell
tumors. Germ cell tumors are further categorized as either seminomas or nonseminomatous
tumors. Other malignant testicular tumors include those of gonadal stromal origin,
lymphoma, leukemia, and metastases.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

====Seminoma====
[[File:Ultrasound images of seminomas.jpg|thumb|Fig. 3. Seminoma. (a) Seminoma usually presents as a homogeneous hypoechoic nodule confined within the tunica albuginea. (b) Sonography shows a large heterogeneous mass occupying nearly the whole testis but still confined within the tunica albuginea, it is rare for seminoma to invade to peritesticular structures.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;]]
Approximately 95% of malignant testicular tumors are germ cell tumors, of which
seminoma is the most common. It accounts for 35%–50% of all germ cell tumors. Seminomas occur in a slightly older age group when compared with other nonseminomatous tumor, with a peak incidence in the forth and fifth decades. They are less
aggressive than other testicular tumors and usually confined within the tunica albuginea at
presentation. Seminomas are associated with the best prognosis of the germ cell tumors
because of their high sensitivity to radiation and chemotherapy.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

Seminoma is the most common tumor type in cryptorchid testes. The risk of developing a
seminoma is increased in patients with cryptorchidism, even after orchiopexy. There is an
increased incidence of malignancy developing in the contralateral testis too, hence
sonography is sometimes used to screen for an occult tumor in the remaining testis.
On US images, seminomas are generally uniformly hypoechoic, larger tumors may be more
heterogeneous [Fig. 3]. Seminomas are usually confined by the tunica albuginea and rarely
extend to peritesticular structures. Lymphatic spread to retroperitoneal lymph nodes and
hematogenous metastases to lung, brain, or both are evident in about 25% of patients at the
time of presentation.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

====Nonseminomatous germ cell tumors====
Nonseminomatous germ cell tumors most often affect men in their third decades of life.
Histologically, the presence of any nonseminomatous cell types in a testicular germ cell
tumor classifies it as a nonseminomatous tumor, even if most of the tumor cells belong to
seminona. These subtypes include yolk sac tumor, embryonal cell carcinoma, teratocarcinoma,
teratoma, and choriocarcinoma. Clinically nonsemionatous tumors usually present as mixed
germ cell tumors with variety cell types and in different proportions.

'''Embryonal cell carcinoma'''
[[File:Ultrasonography of embryonal cell carcinoma.jpg|thumb|Embryonal cell carcinoma. Longitudinal ultrasound image of the testis shows an irregular heterogeneous mass that forms an irregular margin with the tunica albuginea.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;]]
Embryonal cell carcinomas, a more aggressive tumor than
seminoma usually occurs in men in their 30s. Although it is the second most common
testicular tumor after seminoma, pure embryonal cell carcinoma is rare and constitutes only
about 3 percent of the nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. Most of the cases occur in
combination with other cell types.
At ultrasound, embryonal cell carcinomas are predominantly hypoechoic lesions with ill
defined margins and an inhomogeneous echotexture. Echogenic foci due to hemorrhage,
calcification, or fibrosis are commonly seen. Twenty percent of embryonal cell carcinomas
have cystic components. The tumor may invade into the tunica albuginea
resulting in contour distortion of the testis [Fig. 4].&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

'''Yolk sac tumor'''
&lt;br&gt;Yolk sac tumors also known as endodermal sinus tumors account for 80%
of childhood testicular tumors, with most cases occurring before the age of 2 years. Alpha-fetoprotein is normally
elevated in greater than 90% of patients with yolk sac tumor (Woodward et al, 2002, as cited
in Ulbright et al, 1999). In its pure form, yolk sac tumor is rare in adults; however yolk sac
elements are frequently seen in tumors with mixed histologic features in adults and thus
indicate poor prognosis. The US appearance of yolk sac tumor is usually nonspecific and
consists of inhomogeneous mass that may contain echogenic foci secondary to hemorrhage.
Choriocarcinoma --- Choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant testicular tumor that usually
develops in the 2nd and 3rd decades of life. Pure choriocarcinomas are rare and represent
only less than 1 percent of all testicular tumors. Choriocarcinomas
are composed of both cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts, with the latter responsible
for the clinical elevation of human chorionic gonadotrophic hormone level. As microscopic
vascular invasion is common in choriocarcinoma, hematogeneous metastasis, especially to
the lungs is common. Many
choriocarcinomas show extensive hemorrhagic necrosis in the central portion of the tumor;
this appears as mixed cystic and solid components at ultrasound.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

'''Teratoma'''
Although teratoma is the second most common testicular tumor in children, it
affects all age groups. Mature teratoma in children is often benign, but teratoma in adults,
regardless of age, should be considered as malignant. Teratomas are composed of all three
germ cell layers, i.e. endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. At ultrasound, teratomas
generally form well-circumscribed complex masses. Echogenic foci representing
calcification, cartilage, immature bone and fibrosis are commonly seen [Fig. 5]. Cysts are
also a common feature and depending on the contents of the cysts i.e. serous, mucoid or
keratinous fluid, it may present as anechoic or complex structure [Fig. 6].&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;
&lt;gallery mode=packed&gt;

Longitudinal sonography of the right testis shows a cystic mass contains calcification with no obvious acoustic shadow.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Non-germ cell tumours===
====Sex cord-stromal tumours====
Sex cord-stromal (gonadal stromal) tumors of the testis, account for 4 per cent of all
testicular tumors. The most common are Leydig and Sertoli cell tumors.
Although the majority of these tumors are benign, these tumors can produce hormonal
changes, for example, Leydig cell tumor in a child may produce isosexual virilization. In
adult, it may have no endocrine manifestation or gynecomastia, and decrease in libido may
result from production of estrogens. These tumors are typically small and are usually
discovered incidentally. They do not have any specific ultrasound appearance but appear as
well-defined hypoechoic lesions. These tumors are usually removed because they cannot be
distinguished from malignant germ cell tumors.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

Leydig cell tumors are the most common type of sex cord–stromal tumor of the testis,
accounting for 1%–3% of all testicular tumors. They can be seen in any age group, they are
generally small solid masses, but they may show cystic areas, hemorrhage, or necrosis. Their sonographic appearance is
variable and is indistinguishable from that of germ cell tumors.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

Sertoli cell tumors are less common, constituting less than 1% of testicular tumors. They are
less likely than Leydig cell tumors to be hormonally active, but gynecomastia can occur. Sertoli cell tumors are typically well circumscribed, unilateral, round to lobulated masses.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

====Lymphoma====
[[File:Scrotal ultrasonography of lymphoma.jpg|thumb|Fig. 7. Lymphoma. Lymphoma in a 61 year-old man. Longitudinal sonography shows an irregular hypoechoic lesion occupied nearly the whole testis.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;]]

[[File:Scrotal ultrasonography of primary lymphoma.jpg|thumb|Fig. 8. Primary Lymphoma. Longitudinal sonography of a 64 year-old man shows a lymphoma mimicking a germ cell tumor.]]

Clinically lymphoma can manifest in one of three ways: as the primary site of involvement,
or as a secondary tumor such as the initial manifestation of clinically occult disease or
recurrent disease. Although lymphomas constitute 5% of testicular tumors and are almost
exclusively diffuse non-Hodgkin B-cell tumors, only less than 1 % of non-Hodgkin
lymphomas involve the testis.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

Patients with testicular lymphoma are usually old aged around 60 years of age, present with
painless testicular enlargement and less commonly with other systemic symptoms such as
weight loss, anorexia, fever and weakness. Bilateral testicle involvements are common and
occur in 8.5% to 18% of cases. At sonography, most lymphomas are homogeneous and diffusely replace the testis [Fig. 7].
However focal hypoechoic lesions can occur, hemorrhage and necrosis are rare. At times,
the sonographic appearance of lymphoma is indistinguishable from that of the germ cell
tumors [Fig. 8], then the patient’s age at presentation, symptoms, and medical history, as
well as multiplicity and bilaterality of the lesions, are all important factors in making the
appropriate diagnosis.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

====Leukemia====
Primary leukemia of the testis is rare. However due to the presence of blood-testis barrier,
chemotherapeutic agents are unable to reach the testis, hence in boys with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, testicular involvement is reported in 5% to 10% of patients, with
the majority found during clinical remission. The sonographic
appearance of leukemia of the testis can be quite varied, as the tumors may be unilateral or
bilateral, diffuse or focal, hypoechoic or hyperechoic. These findings
are usually indistinguishable from that of the lymphoma [Fig. 9].&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

&lt;gallery widths=180px heights=150px&gt;

===Epidermoid cyst===
[[File:Scrotal ultrasonography of epidermoid cyst.jpg|thumb|Fig. 10. Epidermoid cyst. Onion peel appearances of the tumor together with absence of vascular flow are typical findings of epidermoid cyst.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;]]

Epidermoid cysts, also known as keratocysts, are benign epithelial tumors which usually occur in the second to fourth decades and accounts for only 1–2% of all intratesticular tumors. As these tumors have a benign biological behavior and with no malignant potential,
preoperative recognition of this tumor is important as this will lead to testicle preserving
surgery (enucleation) rather than unnecessary orchiectomy.
Clinically, epidermoid cyst cannot be differentiated from other testicular tumors, typically
presenting as a non-tender, palpable, solitary intratesticular mass. Tumor markers such as
serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha-feto protein are negative.
The ultrasound patterns of epidermoid cysts are variable and include:
#A mass with a target appearance, i.e. a central hypoechoic area surrounded by an
echolucent rim;
#An echogenic mass with dense acoustic shadowing due to calcification;
# A well-circumscribed mass with a hyperechoic rim;
# Mixed pattern having heterogeneous echotexture and poor-defined contour and
# An onion peel appearance consisting of alternating rings of hyperechogenicities and
hypoechogenicities.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

However, these patterns, except the latter one, may be considered as non-specific as
heterogeneous echotexture and shadowing calcification can also be detected in malignant
testicular tumors. The onion peel pattern of epidermoid cyst [Fig. 10]
correlates well with the pathologic finding of multiple layers of keratin debris produced by
the lining of the epidermoid cyst. This sonographic appearance should be considered
characteristic of an epidermoid cyst and corresponds to the natural evolution of the cyst.
Absence of vascular flow is another important feature that is helpful in differentiation of
epidermoid cyst from other solid intratesticular lesions.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

==Extratesticular tumors==
Although most of the extratesticular lesions are benign, malignancy does occur; the most
common malignant tumors in infants and children are rhabdomyosarcomas. Other malignant tumors include liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma and mesothelioma.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

===Rhabdomyosarcoma===
[[File:Scrotal ultrasonography of rhabdomyosarcoma.jpg|thumb|Rhabdomyosarcoma (a) Longituidinal section (composite image) of high resolution ultrasound of a 14 year-old boy shows a well defined hypoechoic extratesticular mass is found in the left scrotum, hydrocele is also present. (b) Color Doppler ultrasound shows that the mass is hypervascular.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;]]

Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common tumor of the lower genitourinary tract in children in
the first two decades, it may develop anywhere in the body, and 4% occur in the paratesticular
region which carries a better outcome than lesions elsewhere in the genitourinary tract. Clinically, the patient usually presents with non-specific complaints of a unilateral, painless intrascrotal swelling not associated with fever.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

Transillumination test is positive when a hydrocele is present, often resulting in a
misdiagnosis of epididymitis, which is more commonly associated with hydrocele.
The ultrasound findings of paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma are variable. It usually
presents as an echo-poor mass [Fig. 11a] with or without hydrocele. With color Doppler sonography these tumors are generally hypervascular.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

===Mesothelioma===
[[File:Scrotal ultrasonography of mesothelioma.jpg|thumb|Mesothelioma arising from the tunica vaginalis. Color Doppler ultrasound demonstrates a well-defined hypoechoic nodule occupying the left epididymal head, with a few areas of color flow demonstrated. The left testis is intact with no focal nodule detected. Hydrocele is also present.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;]]

Malignant mesothelioma is an uncommon tumor arising in body cavities lined by
mesothelium. The majority of these tumors are found in the pleura, peritoneum and less
frequently pericardium. As the tunica vaginalis is a layer of reflected peritoneum,
mesothelioma can occur in the scrotal sac. Although trauma, herniorrhaphy and long term
hydrocele have been considered as the predisposing factors for development of malignant mesothelioma, the only well
established risk factor is asbestos exposure. Patients with
malignant mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis frequently have a progressively enlarging
hydrocele and less frequently a scrotal mass, rapid re-accumulation of fluid after aspiration
raises the suggestion of malignancy.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

The reported ultrasound features of mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis testis are variable.
Hydrocele, either simple or complex is present and may be associated with:&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;
#multiple extratesticular papillary projections of mixed echogenicity; 
#multiple extratesticular nodular masses of increased echogenicity;
#focal irregular thickening of the tunica vaginalis testis; (4) a simple
hydrocele as the only finding and
#A single hypoechoic mass located in the epididymal head. With color Doppler sonography, mesothelioma is hypovascular [Fig. 12].

===Leiomyoma===
[[File:Scrotal ultrasonography of leiomyoma.jpg|thumb|Leiomyoma arising from tunica albuginea. (a) Montage of 2 contiguous sonograms of a 67 year-old man shows a well-defined extratesticular mass with a whorl-shaped echotexture. (b) Color
Doppler sonogram shows no internal vascularity. Note the presence of multiple shadows
not associated with echogenic foci in the mass.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;]]

Leiomyomas are benign neoplasms that may arise from any structure or organ containing
smooth muscle. The majority of genitourinary leiomyomas are found in the renal capsule,
but this tumor has also been reported in the epididymis, spermatic cord, and tunica
albuginea. Scrotal leiomyomas have been reported in patients from the fourth to ninth
decades of life with most presenting during the fifth decade. These tumors are generally
slow growth and asymptomatic. The sonographic features of leiomyomas have been
reported as solid hypoechoic or heterogeneous masses that may or may not contain
shadowing calcification. Other findings include whorl shaped configuration [Fig. 13a] of the nodule and multiple, narrow areas of shadowing not cast by calcifications [Fig. 13b], but corresponding to transition zones between the various tissue components of the mass are characteristic of leiomyoma and may help
differentiate it from other scrotal tumors.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

===Fat containing tumors===
====Lipoma====
[[File:Scrotal ultrasonography of lipoma.jpg|thumb|Lipoma at spermatic cord and testiscle. (a) Longitudinal scrotal sonography of a 61 year-old patient shows a well defined hyperechoic nodule is seen in the scrotum. (b) Scrotal sonography of the same patient shows a hyper echoic nodule in the left testis, pathology proved that this is a lipoma too.]]

Lipoma is the most common nontesticular intrascrotal tumor. It can be divided into 3 types
depending upon the site of origination and spread:&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;
#Originating in the spermatic cord with spread to the scrotum;
#Originating and developing within the cord (most common type) and
#Originating and developing within the scrotum.

At ultrasound, lipoma is a well–defined, homogeneous, hyperechoic paratesticular lesion of
varying size [Fig. 14]. The simple finding of an echogenic fatty mass within the inguinal
canal, while suggestive of a lipoma, should also raise a question of fat from the omentum
secondary to an inguinal hernia. However lipomas are well-defined masses, whereas
herniated omentum appears to be more elongated and can be traced to the inguinal area,
hence scanning along the inguinal canal as well as the scrotum is necessary to make the
differential diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography are
helpful in doubtful cases.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

====Liposarcoma====
Malignant extratesticular tumors are rare. Most of the malignant tumors are solid and have
nonspecific features on ultrasonography. The majority of the malignant extratesticular
tumors arise from spermatic cord with liposarcoma being the most common in adults. On gross specimen, liposarcoma is a solid, bulky lipomatous tumor
with heterogeneous architecture, often containing areas of calcification. Although the sonographic appearances of liposarcoma are variable and nonspecific, it
still provides a clue about the presence of lipomatous matrix.Echogenic areas corresponding
to fat often associated with poor sound transmission and areas of heterogeneous
echogenicity corresponding to nonlipomatous component are present. Some
liposarcomas may also mimic the sonographic appearance of lipomas [Fig. 16] and hernias
that contain omentum, but lipomas are generally smaller and more homogeneous and
hernias are elongated masses that can often be traced back to the inguinal canal. CT and MR
imaging are more specific, as they can easily recognize fatty component along with other
soft tissue component more clearly than ultrasound.

A homogeneous hypoechoic mass presents with the same appearance of lipoma, rapid growth of this tumors grants surgical intervention with pathology proved to be well differentiated liposarcoma.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Adenomatoid tumor===
[[File:Scrotal ultrasonography of adenomatoid tumor at epididymis.jpg|thumb|Adenomatoid tumor at epididymis. A nodule that is isoechoic to the testis is seen occupying nearly the entire epididymal tail.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;]]

Adenomatoid tumors are the most common tumors of the epididymis and account for
approximately 30% of all paratesticular neoplasms, second only to lipoma. They are usually unilateral, more common on the left side, and usually involve the
epididymal tail. Adenomatoid tumor typically occurs in men during the third and fourth
decades of life. Patients usually present with a painless scrotal mass that is smooth, round
and well circumscribed on palpation. They are believed to be of mesothelial origin and are
universally benign. Their sonographic appearance is that of a round shaped, well-defined,
homogeneous mass with echogenicity ranging from hypo- to iso- to hyperechoic.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

===Fibrous pseudotumor===
Fibrous pseudotumors, also known as fibromas are thought to be reactive, nonneoplastic
lesions. They can occur at any age, about 50% of fibromas are associated with hydrocele, and
30% are associated with a history of trauma or inflammation (Akbar et al, 2003). Although
the exact cause of this tumor is not completely understood, it is generally believed that these
lesions represent a benign reactive proliferation of inflammatory and fibrous tissue, in
response to chronic irritation.
Sonographic evaluation generally shows one or more solid nodules arising from the tunica
vaginalis, epididymis, spermatic cord and tunica albuginea [Fig. 18]. A hydrocele is frequently
present too. The nodules may appear hypoechoic or hyperechoic, depending on the amount of collagen or fibroblast present.
Acoustic shadowing may occur in the absence of calcification due to the dense collagen
component of this tumor. With color Doppler sonography, a small to moderate amount of
vascularity may be seen [Fig. 19].&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

&lt;gallery widths=180 heights=150&gt;

File:Scrotal ultrasonography with Doppler of fibrous pseudotumour.jpg|Fig. 19. Fibrous pseudotumor. With color Doppler, a little vascular flow is seen in this fibrous pseudotumor.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Inflammation==
===Epididymitis and epididymo-orchitis===
[[File:Scrotal ultrasonography of epididymo-orchitis.jpg|thumb|Epididymo-orchitis in a 77 year-old man. (a) Transverse sonography shows enlargement of the epididymis with hypoechogenicity noted over the testis and epididymis associated with scrotal wall thickening. (b) Color Doppler sonography showed hyperemic change of the testis and epididymis, presenting as an “inferno” vascular flow pattern.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;]]

Epididymitis and epididymo-orchitis are common causes of acute scrotal pain in adolescent
boys and adults. At physical examination, they usually are palpable as tender and enlarged
structures. Clinically, this disease can be differentiated from torsion of the spermatic cord by
elevation of the testes above the pubic symphysis. If scrotal pain decreases, it is more likely
to be due to epidiymitis rather than torsion (Prehn’s sign). Most cases of epididymitis are
secondary to sexually transmitted disease or retrograde bacteria infection from the urinary
bladder. The infection usually begins in the epididymal tail and spreads to the epididymal
body and head. Approximately 20% to 40 % of cases are associated with orchitis due to
direct spread of infection into the testis.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

At ultrasound, the findings of acute epididymitis include an enlarged hypoechoic or
hyperechoic (presumably secondary to hemorrhage) epididymis [Fig. 20a]. Other signs of
inflammation such as increased vascularity, reactive hydrocele, pyocele and scrotal wall
thickening may also be present. Testicular involvement is confirmed by the presence of
testicular enlargement and an inhomogeneous echotexture. Hypervascularity on color
Doppler images [Fig. 20b] is a well-established diagnostic criterion and may be the only
imaging finding of epididymo-orchitis in some men.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

&lt;gallery widths=220 heights=180&gt;

There is also swelling of peritesticular tissue.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Tuberculous epididymo-orchitis===
[[File:Scrotal ultrasonography of tuberculous epididymo-orchitis.jpg|thumb|Fig. 21. Tuberculous epididymo-orchitis. (a) Transverse sonography of a surgically proved tuberculous epididymitis shows an enlarged epididymis containing calcification and necrosis. (b) Composite image: Transverse sonography of the same patient shows multiple hypoechoic nodules in the left testis associated with surrounding reactive hydrocele.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;]]

Although the genitourinary tract is the most common site of extra-pulmonary involvement
by tuberculosis, tuberculous infection of the scrotum is rare and occurs in approximately 7%
of patients with tuberculosis. At the
initial stage of infection, the epididymis alone is involved. However if appropriate
antituberculous treatment is not administered promptly, the infection will spreads to the
ipsilateral testis. The occurrence of isolated testicular tuberculosis is rare. Clinically patients with tuberculous epididymo-orchitis may present with painful or painless enlargement of the scrotum, hence they cannot be distinguished from lesions such as testicular tumor, testicular infarction and may mimic testicular torsion..&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

At ultrasound, tuberculous epididymitis is characterized by an enlarged epididymis with
variable echogenicity. The presence of calcification, caseation necrosis, granulomas and
fibrosis can result in heterogeneous echogenicity [Fig. 21a]. The ultrasound findings of
tuberculous orchitis are as follow: (a) diffusely enlarged heterogeneously hypoechoic testis
(b) diffusely enlarged homogeneously hypoechoic testis (c) nodular enlarged
heterogeneously hypoechoic testis and (d) presence of multiple small hypoechoic nodules in
an enlarged testis [Fig. 21b].&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

Although both bacterial and tuberculous infections may involve both the epididymis and
the testes, an enlarged epididymis with heterogeneously hypoechoic pattern favors a
diagnosis of tuberculosis (Muttarak and Peh, 2006, as cited in Kim et al, 1993 and Chung et
al, 1997). With color Doppler ultrasound, a diffuse increased blood flow pattern is seen in
bacterial epididymitis, whereas focal linear or spotty blood flow signals are seen in the
peripheral zone of the affected epididymis in patients with tuberculosis.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

===Fournier gangrene===
[[File:Scrotal ultrasonography of Fournier gangrene.jpg|thumb|Fournier gangrene. (a) Transverse sonography image shows echogenic areas with dirty shadowing representing air in the perineum. (b) Gas presented as numerous, discrete,
hyperechoic foci with reverberation artifacts are seen at scrotal wall.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;]]

Fournier gangrene is a polymicrobial necrotizing fascitis involving the perineal, perianal, or
genital regions and constitutes a true surgical emergency with a potentially high mortality
rate. It usually develops from a perineal or genitourinary infection, but can arise following
local trauma with secondary infection of the wound. 40–60% of patients are being diabetic.
Although the diagnosis of Fournier gangrene is often made clinically, diagnostic imaging is
useful in ambiguous cases.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

The sonographic hallmark of Fournier gangrene is presence of subcutaneous gas within the
thickened scrotal wall. At ultrasound, the gas appears as numerous, discrete, hyperechoic
foci with reverberation artifacts [Fig. 22]. Evidence of gas within the scrotal wall may be
seen prior to clinical crepitus. The only other condition manifesting with gas at sonographic
examination is an inguinoscrotal hernia. This can be differentiated from Fournier gangrene
by the presence of gas within the protruding bowel lumen and away from the scrotal wall.
(Levenson et al, 2008).&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

==Other benign lesions of the scrotum==
===Tubular ectasia===
[[File:Scrotal ultrasonography of tubular ectasia.jpg|thumb|Fig. 23. Tubular ectasia of the testis. Honey-comb shaped cystic lesion at mediastinum testis.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;]]

[[File:Scrotal ultrasonography of tubular ectasia mimicking a tumor.jpg|thumb|Fig. 24. Tubular ectasia of the testis . Lesion in the testis mimicking testicular tumor, but the microcystic appearance of this lesion is suggestive of tubular ectasia.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;]]

The normal testis consists of several hundred lobules, with each lobule containing several
seminiferous tubules. The seminiferous tubules of each lobule merge to form the straight
tubes, which in turn converge to form the rete testis. The rete testis tubules, which lie within
the mediastinum testis, are an anastomosing network of irregular channels with a broad
lumen, which then empties into the efferent ductules to give rise to the head of the
epididymis. Obstruction in the epididymis or efferent ductules may lead to cystic dilatation
of the efferent ductules, which usually presents as an epididymal cyst on ultrasound.
However, in the more proximal portion this could lead to the formation of an intratesticular
cyst or dilatation of the tubules, so called tubular ectasia. Factors contributing to the
development of tubular ectasia include epididymitis, testicular biopsy, vasectomy or an
aging process. Clinically this lesion is usually asymptomatic. The
ultrasound appearance of a microcystic or multiple tubular-like lesions located at the
mediastinal testis [Fig. 23] and associated with an epididymal cyst in a middle-aged or
elderly patient should alert the sonographer to the possibility of tubular ectasia.
The differential diagnosis of a multicystic lesion in testis should include a cystic tumor,
especially a cystic teratoma. A cystic teratoma is usually a palpable lesion containing both
solid and cystic components; and the cysts are normally larger than that of tubular ectasia,
which appear microcystic [Fig. 24]. Furthermore, the location of tubular ectasia in the
mediastinum testis is also helpful in making the differential diagnosis.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

===Testicular microlithiasis===
Histologically, testicular microlithiasis refers to the scattered laminated calcium deposits in
the lumina of the seminiferous tubules. These calcifications arise from degeneration of the
cells lining the seminiferous tubules. At ultrasonography, microliths appear as tiny punctate
echogenic foci, which typically do not shadow. Although minor microcalcification within a
testis is considered normal, the typical US appearance of testicular microlithiasis is of
multiple nonshadowing echogenic foci measuring 2–3 mm and randomly scattered
throughout the testicular parenchyma [Fig. 25] (Dogra et al, 2003, as cited in Janzen et al,
1992). The clinical significance of testicular microlithiasis is that it is associated with
increased risk of testicular malignancy, thus follow up of affected individuals with scrotal
sonography is necessary to ensure that a testicular tumor does not develop.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

&lt;gallery heights=150 widths=180&gt;
File:Scrotal ultrasonography of testicular microlithiasis.jpg|Fig. 25. Testicular microlithiasis. Multiple hyperechoic foci without acoustic shadow presenting as a starry sky appearance is seen in the testis.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Testicular torsion===
[[File:Scrotal ultrasonography of testicular torsion.jpg|thumb|Fig. 26. Testicular torsion of the right testis. Absence of vascular flow and ill-defined hypoechoic lesions are seen in the testis.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;]]

The normal testis and epididymis are anchored to the scrotal wall. If there is a lack of
development of these attachments, the testis is free to twist on its vascular pedicle. This will
result in torsion of the spermatic cord and interruption of testicular blood flow. Testicular
torsion occurs most commonly at 12 to 18 years but can occur at any age. Torsion results in
swelling and edema of the testis, and as the edema increases, testicular perfusion is further
altered. The extent of testicular ischemia depends on the degree of torsion, which ranges
from 180° to 720° or greater. The testicular salvage rate depends on the degree of torsion and
the duration of ischemia. A nearly 100% salvage rate exists within the first 6 hours after the
onset of symptoms; a 70% rate, within 6–12 hours; and a 20% rate, within 12–24 hours. Therefore testicular torsion is a surgical emergency and the role of ultrasound is to differentiate it from epididymitis as both disease
presents with acute testicular pain clinically.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

There are two types of testicular torsion: extravaginal and intravaginal. Extravaginal torsion
occurs exclusively in newborns. Ultrasound findings include an enlarged heterogeneous
testis, ipsilateral hydrocele, thickened scrotal wall and absence of vascular flow in the testis
and spermatic cord. The ultrasound findings of intravaginal torsion vary with the duration and the degree of rotation of the spermatic cord. Gray scale ultrasound may appear normal if the torsion is just occurred. At 4-6 hours
after onset of torsion, enlarged testis with decreased echogenicity is seen. At 24 hours after
onset, the testis appears heterogeneous due to vascular congestion, hemorrhage and
infarction. As gray scale ultrasound is often normal during early onset of
torsion, Doppler sonography is considered as essential in early diagnosis of testicular
torsion. The absence of testicular flow at color and power Doppler ultrasound is considered
diagnostic of ischemia, provided that the scanner is set for detection of slow flow,
the sampling box is small and the scanner is adjusted for the lowest repetition frequency
and the lowest possible threshold setting.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

===Varicocele===
[[File:Scrotal ultrasonography of varicocele.jpg|thumb|Fig. 27. Varicocele. (a) Multiple tortuous tubular like structure are seen in the left scrotum. (b) Color Doppler sonography shows vascular reflux during Valsalva’s maneuver.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;]]

[[File:Scrotal ultrasonography of intratesticular varicocele.jpg|thumb|Fig. 28. Intratesticular varicocele. (a) Dilated tubular structures are seen within the testis. (b) Presence of vascular reflux is noted during Valsalva’s maneuver.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;]]

Varicocele refers to an abnormal dilatation of the veins of the spermatic cord due to
incompetence of valve in the spermatic vein. This results in impaired blood drainage into
the spermatic vein when the patient assumes a standing position or during Valsalva’s
maneuver. Varicoceles are more common on the left side due to the following reasons (a)
The left testicular vein is longer; (b) the left testicular vein enters the left renal vein at a right
angle; (c) the left testicular artery in some men arches over the left renal vein, thereby
compressing it; and (d) the descending colon distended with feces may compress the left
testicular vein.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

The US appearance of varicocele consists of multiple, hypoechoic, serpiginous, tubular like
structures of varying sizes larger than 2 mm in diameter that are usually best visualized
superior or lateral to the testis [Fig. 27a]. Color flow and duplex Doppler US optimized for
low-flow velocities help confirm the venous flow pattern, with phasic variation and
retrograde filling during a Valsalva’s maneuver [Fig. 27b]. Intratesticular varicocele may
appear as a vague hypoechoic area in the testis or mimics tubular ectasia. With color
Doppler, this intratesticular hypoechoic area also showed reflux of vascular flow during
Valsalva’s maneuver [Fig. 28].&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

===Undescended testis===
[[File:Scrotal ultrasonography of undescended testis.jpg|thumb|Fig. 29. Undescended testis. (a) Normal testis in the scrotum. (b) Atrophic and decreased echogenicity of the contralateral testis of the same patient seen in the inguinal region.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;]]

Normally the testes begin its descent through the inguinal canal to the scrotum at 36 weeks’
of gestation and completed at birth. Failure in the course of testes descent will result in
undescended testes ([[Cryptorchidism]]). 

Undescended testis is found in 4% of full-term infants but only 0.8% of
males at the age of 1 year have true cryptorchidism. Although an undescended testis can be
found anywhere along the pathway of descent from the retroperitoneum to the scrotum, the
inguinal canal is the most common site for an undescended testis. Deviation of testis from
the normal pathway of descent will result in ectopic testis that is commonly seen in
pubopenile, femoral triangle and perineal regions.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

Besides infertility, undescended testes carry an increased risk of malignancy even for the
normally located contralateral testis. The risk of malignancy is estimated to be as high as 10 times the normal individual with seminoma being the most common malignancy{{cn|date=October 2018}}.
 
The incidence of infertility is decreased if surgical orchiopexy is carried out before the 1-3 years
but the risk of malignancy does not change.
Because of the superficial location of the inguinal canal in children, sonography of
undescended testes should be performed with a high frequency transducer. At ultrasound,
the undescended testis usually appears small, less echogenic than the contralateral normal
testis and usually located in the inguinal region [Fig. 29]. With color Doppler, the vascularity
of the undescended testis is poor.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

===Testicular appendiceal torsion===
[[File:Scrotal ultrasonography of testicular appendiceal torsion.jpg|thumb|Fig. 30. Testicular appendiceal torsion. A hyperechoic lesion with surrounding vascularity is seen in the groove between the testis and epididymis.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;]]

At sonography, the appendix testis usually appears as a 5 mm ovoid structure located in the
groove between the testis and the epididymis. Normally it is isoechoic to the testis but at
times it may be cystic. The appendix epididymis is of the same size as the appendix testis
but is more often pedunculated. Clinically pain may occur with torsion of either appendage.
Physical examination showed a small, firm nodule is palpable on the superior aspect of the
testis and a bluish discoloration known as ‘‘blue dot’’ sign may be seen on the overlying
skin. Torsion of the appendiceal
testis most frequently involved in boys aged 7-14 years (Dogra and Bhatt 2004).
The sonographic features of testicular appendiceal torsion includes a circular mass with
variable echogenicity located adjacent to the testis or epididymis [Fig. 30], reactive
hydrocele and skin thickening of the scrotum is common, increased peripheral vascular flow
may be found around the testicular appendage on color Doppler ultrasound. Surgical
intervention is unnecessary and pain usually resolves in 2 to 3 days with an atrophied or
calcified appendages remaining.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

==Conclusion==
Ultrasound remains as the mainstay in scrotal imaging not only because of its high accuracy,
excellent depiction of scrotal anatomy, low cost and wide availability, it is also useful in
determining whether a mass is intra- or extra-testicular, thus providing us useful and
valuable information to decide whether a mass is benign or malignant even though
malignancy do occur in extratesticular tumors and vice versa. Furthermore, ultrasound also
provides information essential to reach a specific diagnosis in patients with testicular
torsion, testicular appendiceal torsion and inflammation such as epididymo-orchitis,
Fournier gangrene etc, thus enabling us to avoid unnecessary operation.&lt;ref name="MakTzeng2012"/&gt;

[[Self-esteem]] can be defined as how favorably individuals evaluate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R.F. &amp; Bushman, B. (2008). Social Psychology and Human Nature (1st Edition). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth. .&lt;/ref&gt; According to Leary, self-esteem is the relationship between one’s real self and one’s ideal self, feeding off of favorable behaviors.&lt;ref name="leary1999"&gt;Leary, M.R. (1999) Making Sense of Self-Esteem. Current Directions in Psychological Science 8 (1), 32–35.&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to an individual's sense of his or her value or worth, or the extent to which a person values, approves of, appreciates, prizes, or likes him or herself.&lt;ref name="Adler, N 2004"&gt;Adler, N &amp; Stewart, J ( 2004) Self-Esteem. Research Network on SES &amp; Health.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-esteem is generally considered the evaluative component of the self-concept, a broader representation of the self that includes cognitive and behavioral aspects as well as evaluative or affective ones.&lt;ref name="Adler, N 2004"/&gt; There are several different proposals as to the functions of self-esteem. One proposal includes to satisfy the inherent need to feel good about one self. Another one would be to minimize social rejection .&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, D. B., Wood, J. V., &amp; Holmes, J. G. (2007). Testing sociometer theory: Self-esteem and the importance of acceptance for social decision-making. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 43(3), 425-432.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leary1999" /&gt; Self-esteem is also known as A way for a person to remain dominant in relationships (Barkow, 1980).&lt;ref&gt;Barkow, J. (1980). Prestige and self-esteem: A biosocial interpretation. In D. R. Omark, F. F. Strayer, &amp; D. G. Freedman (Eds.), Dominance relations: An ethological view of human conflict and social interaction (pp. 319–332). New York: Garland STPM Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-esteem is known to protect people from fear that has potential of arising from the prospect of death- terror management theory.&lt;ref name="leary1999" /&gt; Self-esteem helps motivate people to achieve their goals- high self-esteem leading to coping in situations and low self-esteem leading to avoidance.&lt;ref name="leary1999" /&gt;

==Evolutionary perspectives==
===Sociometer theory===
{{Main|Sociometer}}
The sociometer theory was developed by Mark Leary (1999)&lt;ref name="leary1999"/&gt; to explain the functions of self-esteem. A sociometer is a measure of how desirable one would be to other people - this is influenced by one’s self-esteem. They suggested that self-esteem has evolved to monitor one’s social acceptance and is used as a gauge for avoiding social devaluation and rejection.
The sociometer theory is strongly grounded in evolutionary theories which suggest that survival depends on social acceptance for reasons such as protection, reciprocal behaviours and most importantly reproduction. The monitoring of one's acceptance via self-esteem is therefore crucial in order to achieve these kinds of social interactions and be better able to compete for the social benefits of them.

Kirkpatrick and Ellis (2003) expanded on Leary’s work and suggested that the sociometer’s function was not only to ensure that an individual was not excluded from their social group but also to rate the strength of the social group compared to other groups.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkpatrick, L. A., &amp; Ellis, B. J. (2001). An evolutionary-psychological approach to self-esteem: multiple domains and multiple functions. In G. J. O. Fletcher &amp; M. S. Clark (Eds.), Blackwell handbook of social psychology: Interpersonal processes (pp. 411-436). Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Leary and his colleagues stated that a sociometer is a measure of how a person is desirable by the people and this is oftentimes influenced through a person's self-esteem.

===Self-determination theory===
{{Main|Self-determination theory}}
Self-determination theory (SDT) states that man is born with an intrinsic motivation to explore, absorb and master his surroundings and that true high self-esteem is reported when the basic psychological nutrients, or needs, of life (relatedness, competency and autonomy) are in balance Nayler, C. (2005) Theories of Self Esteem. Positive Psychology.

===Ethological perspective===
The ethological perspective (Barkow, 1980) suggests that self-esteem is an adaptation that has evolved for the purpose of maintaining dominance in relationships. It is said that human beings have evolved certain mechanisms for monitoring dominance in order to facilitate reproductive behaviours such attaining a mate. Because attention and favorable reactions from others were associated with being dominant, feelings of self-esteem have also become associated with social approval and deference. From this perspective, the motive to evaluate oneself positively in evolutionary terms is to enhance one’s relative dominance (Leary, 1999).

Leary et al. (2001) tested the idea of dominance and social acceptance on self-esteem. Trait self-esteem appeared to be related to the degree to which participants felt accepted by specific people in their lives, but not to the degree to which participants thought those individuals perceived them as dominant. Acceptance and dominance appeared to have independent effects on self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, M.R., Cottrell, C.A. &amp; Phillips, M. (2001) Deconfounding the effects of dominance and social acceptance on self-esteem Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 81(5), 898-909.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terror management theory===
{{Main|Terror management theory}}
The terror management theory, developed by [[Sheldon Solomon]] at al. (1991),&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, S., Greenberg, J., &amp; Pyszczynski, T. (1991). A terror management theory of social behavior: The psychological functions of self-esteem and cultural worldviews. Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 24, 93–159.&lt;/ref&gt; which in relation to self-esteem states that having self-esteem helps protect individuals from the fear they experience at the prospect of their own death. It is suggested that people are constantly searching for ways to enhance their self-esteem in order to quell unconscious death anxiety. This internalisation of cultural values is also a key factor in Terror Management Theory (TMT) in which self-esteem is seen as a culturally based construction derived from integrating specific contingencies valued by society into one's own ‘worldview’. High self-esteem promotes positive affect and personal growth, psychological well-being and coping as a buffer against anxiety in the knowledge of our eventual certain death, and reduces defensive anxiety related behaviour. Nayler, C. (2005) Theories of Self Esteem. Positive Psychology. Terror management theory, based primarily on the writings of Ernest Becker (1962, 1971, 1973, 1975) and Otto
Rank (1936, 1941), posits that self-esteem is sought because it provides protection against the fear of death (Greenberg, Pyszczynski,
&amp; Solomon, 1986; Solomon, Greenberg, &amp; Pyszczynski,1991a). From this perspective, the fear of death is rooted
in an instinct for self-preservation that humans share with other species. Jones, E. McGreggor, H. Pyszczynski, T. Simon, L. &amp; Solomon, S. (1997). Terror Management
Theory and Self –Esteem Reduces Mortality Salience Effects. Personality and Social Psychology 72, 24-36

==Success==
Some researchers believe that having a high self-esteem facilitates goal achievement.
Bednar, Wells, and Peterson (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Bednar, R., Wells, G., &amp; Peterson, S. (1989). Self-esteem: Paradoxes and innovations in clinical theory and practice. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that self-esteem is a form of subjective feedback about the adequacy of the self. This feedback (self-esteem) is positive when the individual copes well with circumstances and is negative when he or she avoids threats. In turn, self-esteem affects subsequent goal achievement; high self-esteem increases coping, and low self-esteem leads to further avoidance (Leary, 1999).

===Illusion of control===
{{Main|Illusion of control}}
Illusion of control is the tendency for human beings to believe they can control, or at least influence, outcomes that they demonstrably have no influence over, a mindset often seen in those who gamble (Langer, 1975).&lt;ref&gt;Langer, E. J. &amp; Roth, J. (1975). Heads I win, tails it's chance: The illusion of control as a function of the sequence of outcomes in a purely chance task. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 34, 191-198.&lt;/ref&gt; However, for individuals who are not gamblers Taylor and Brown (1988) suggest it may serve to be a function of self-esteem. Belief that there is a level of control over the situation a person is in, may lead to an increased level of motivation and performance in a self-regulating manner.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. E., &amp; Brown, J. D. (1988). Illusion and Well-Being - a Social Psychological Perspective On Mental-Health. Psychological Bulletin, 103(2), 193-210.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, one will work harder to become successful if they believe they have control over their success. A high self-esteem would be needed for this belief of control and so the need for a sense of control may be a function of self-esteem.
When applying sociometer theory, it suggests that the illusion of control is an adaptive response in order to self-regulate behaviour to cultural norms and thereby provide an individual with an increased level of self-esteem. In social psychology, the illusion of control is grouped with two other concepts and termed as the ‘positive illusions’.

'''Self-help''' or '''self-improvement''' is a self-guided improvement&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;''APA Dictionary of Physicology'', 1st ed., Gary R. VandenBos, ed., Washington: American Psychological Association, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;—economically, intellectually, or emotionally—often with a substantial [[psychology|psychological]] basis.  Many different self-help group programs exist, each with its own focus, techniques, associated beliefs, proponents and in some cases, [[leadership|leader]]s. Concepts and terms originating in self-help culture and [[Twelve-step program|Twelve-Step]] culture, such as [[Recovery model|recovery]], [[dysfunctional families]], and [[codependency]] have become firmly integrated in mainstream language.&lt;ref&gt;Micki McGee. ''Self-Help, Inc.: Makeover culture in American Life'' (Oxford 2005) p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-help often utilizes publicly available information or [[support groups]], on the Internet as well as in person, where people in similar situations join together.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt; From early examples in self-driven legal practice&lt;ref name="Salerno 2005"&gt;Steve Salerno (2005) ''Sham: How the Self-Help Movement Made America Helpless'', {{ISBN|1-4000-5409-5}} pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; and home-spun advice, the connotations of the word have spread and often apply particularly to [[education]], [[business]], [[psychology]] and [[psychotherapy]], commonly distributed through the popular genre of [[self-help book]]s. According to the ''APA Dictionary of Psychology'', potential benefits of self-help groups that professionals may not be able to provide include friendship, emotional support, experiential knowledge, [[Identity (social science)|identity]], meaningful roles, and a sense of belonging.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;

Groups associated with health conditions may consist of patients and [[caregiver]]s. As well as featuring long-time members sharing [[experience]]s, these health groups can become [[support group]]s and clearing-houses for educational material. Those who help themselves by learning and identifying about health problems can be said to exemplify self-help, while self-help groups can be seen more as peer-to-peer support.

==History==
Within [[classical antiquity]], [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' "opens with moral remonstrances, hammered home in every way that Hesiod can think of."&lt;ref&gt;
John Boardman et al eds., ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (Oxford 1991), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stoics]] offered ethical advice "on the notion of ''eudaimonia''—of well-being, welfare, flourishing."&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; The genre of [[mirror-of-princes writing]]s, which has a long history in [[Greco-Roman]] and Western [[Renaissance]] literature, represents a secular cognate of Biblical wisdom-literature. [[Proverb]]s from many periods, collected and uncollected, embody traditional moral and practical advice of diverse cultures.

The hyphenated [[English compound|compound]] word "self-help" often appeared in the 1800s in a legal context, referring to the doctrine that a party in a dispute has the right to use lawful means on their own initiative to remedy a wrong.&lt;ref&gt;
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd edition, 1989) traces legal usage back to at least 1875; whereas it detects "self-help" as a moral virtue as early as 1831 in [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]]'s ''[[Sartor Resartus]]''.
&lt;/ref&gt;

For some, [[George Combe]]'s "''Constitution''" [1828], in the way that it advocated [[personal responsibility]] and the possibility of naturally sanctioned self-improvement through education or proper self-control, largely inaugurated the self-help movement;"&lt;ref&gt;John Van Wyhe, ''Phrenology and the Origins of Victorian Scientific Naturalism'' (2004) p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=October 2015}} In 1841, an essay by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], entitled [[Compensation (essay)|Compensation]], was published suggesting "every man in his lifetime needs to thank his faults" and "acquire habits of ''self-help''" as "our strength grows out of our weakness."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Waldo Emerson, ''Compensation'' (1841) p. 22 [http://www.emersoncentral.com/compensation.htm Essays]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Smiles]] (1812–1904) published the first self-consciously personal-development "self-help" book—entitled ''[[Self-Help (book)|Self-Help]]''—in 1859. Its opening sentence: "Heaven helps those who help themselves", provides a variation of "God helps them that help themselves", the oft-quoted [[maxim (saying)|maxim]] that had also appeared previously in [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s ''[[Poor Richard's Almanac]]'' (1733–1758). In the 20th century, "[[Dale Carnegie|Carnegie]]'s remarkable success as a self-help author"&lt;ref&gt;Steven Starker, ''Oracle at the Supermarket'' (2002) p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; further developed the genre with ''[[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]'' in 1936. Having failed in several careers, Carnegie became fascinated with success and its link to [[self-confidence]], and his books have since sold over 50 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neil, William J. (2003). ''Business Leaders &amp; Success: 55 Top Business Leaders &amp; How They Achieved Greatness''. [[McGraw-Hill Professional]]. pp. 35–36. {{ISBN|0-07-142680-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, in 1902, [[James Allen (author)|James Allen]] published ''[[As a Man Thinketh]]'', which proceeds from the conviction that "a man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts." Noble thoughts, the book maintains, make for a noble person, whilst lowly thoughts make for a miserable person; and [[Napoleon Hill]]'s ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'' (1937) described the use of repeated [[Optimism|positive thought]]s to attract happiness and wealth by tapping into an "[[Infinity|Infinite]] Intelligence".&lt;ref&gt;Starker, Steven (2002). ''Oracle at the Supermarket: The American Preoccupation With Self-Help Books''. Transaction Publishers. p. 62. {{ISBN|0-7658-0964-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 20th century===

In the final third of the 20th century, "the tremendous growth in self-help publishing...in self-improvement culture"&lt;ref&gt;McGee, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; really took off—something which must be linked to [[postmodernism]] itself—to the way "postmodern subjectivity constructs self-reflexive subjects-in-process."&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Deeds Ermath, ''Sequel to History'' (Princeton 1992) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably at least, "in the literatures of self-improvement...that crisis of subjecthood is not articulated but enacted—demonstrated in ever-expanding self-help book sales."&lt;ref&gt;McGee, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservative turn of the [[neoliberal]] decades also meant a decline in traditional political activism, and increasing "social isolation; Twelve-Step recovery groups were one context in which individuals sought a sense of community...yet another symptom of the psychologizing of the personal"&lt;ref&gt;
Mcgee, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; to more radical critics. Indeed, "some social theorist{{sic}} have argued that the late-20th century preoccupation with the self serves as a tool of social control: soothing political unrest...[for] one's own pursuit of self-invention."'&lt;ref&gt;McGee, p. 22–3&lt;/ref&gt;

==The market==
Within the context of the market, group and corporate attempts to aid the "seeker" have moved into the "self-help" marketplace, with [[Large Group Awareness Training]]s, LGATs&lt;ref&gt;

=== Statistics ===
At the start of the 21st century, "the self-improvement industry, inclusive of books, seminars, audio and video products, and personal coaching, [was] said to constitute a 2.48-billion dollars-a-year industry"&lt;ref&gt;
Micki McGee, ''Self-Help, Inc.: Makeover Culture in American Life'' (Oxford 2005) p. 11
&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States alone. By 2006, research firm Marketdata estimated the "self-improvement" market in the U.S. as worth more than $9 billion—including [[infomercial]]s, [[mail-order catalog]]s, [[holistic]] institutes, books, [[Compact Cassette|audio cassette]]s, [[motivational speaker|motivation-speaker]] seminars, the [[personal coaching]] market, [[weight loss|weight-loss]] and [[stress management|stress-management]] programs.

===Self-help and professional service delivery===
Self-help and mutual-help are very different from—though they may complement—service delivery by professionals:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lloyd |first1=R |title=Modeling community-based, self-help mental health rehabilitation . |journal=Australasian Psychiatry : Bulletin of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists |volume=15 Suppl 1 |pages=S99–103 |pmid=18027146 |year=2007 |doi=10.1080/10398560701701296 }}&lt;/ref&gt; note for example the interface between local self-help and International Aid's service delivery model.

Conflicts can and do arise on that interface, however, with some professionals considering that "the twelve-step approach encourages a kind of contemporary version of 19th-century amateurism or enthusiasm in which self-examination and very general social observations are enough to draw rather large conclusions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lennard J. Davis|title=Obsession: A History|location=London|year=2008|pages=171|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z5ATMl1uCCcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Lennard+J.+Davis,+Obsession:+A+History#v=onepage&amp;q=Lennard%20J.%20Davis%2C%20Obsession%3A%20A%20History&amp;f=false|isbn=9780226137797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The rise of self-help culture has inevitably led to boundary disputes with other approaches and disciplines. Some would object to their classification as "self-help" literature, as with "[[Deborah Tannen]]'s denial of the self-help role of her books" so as to maintain her academic credibility, aware of the danger that "writing a book that becomes a popular success...all but ensures that one's work will lose its long-term legitimacy."&lt;ref&gt;McGee, p. 195 and 245&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Placebo]] effects can never be wholly discounted. Thus careful studies of "the power of subliminal self-help tapes...showed that their content had no real effect...But that's not what the participants thought."&lt;ref&gt;Eliot R. Smith/Diane M. Mackie, ''Social Psychology'' (Hove 2007) p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; "If they thought they'd listened to a self-esteem tape (even though half the labels were wrong), they felt that their self-esteem had gone up. No wonder people keep buying subliminal tape: even though the tapes don't work, people think they do."&lt;ref&gt;Smith/Mackie, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; One might then see much of the self-help industry as part of the "skin trades. People need haircuts, massage, dentistry, wigs and glasses, sociology and surgery, as well as love and advice."&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (London 1972) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;—a skin trade, "not a profession and a science"&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Its practitioners would thus be functioning as "part of the personal service industry rather than as mental health professionals."&lt;ref&gt;McGee, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; While "there is no proof that twelve-step programs 'are superior to any other intervention in reducing alcohol dependence or alcohol-related problems',"&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bakalar 2006, in Davis, p. 178-9&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time it is clear that "there is something about 'groupishness' itself which is curative."&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis''(Penguin 1976) p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for example "smoking increases mortality risk by a factor of just 1.6, while social isolation does so by a factor of 2.0...suggest[ing] an added value to self-help groups such as [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] as surrogate communities."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (London 1996) p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of positive psychologists|Some psychologists]] advocate a [[positive psychology]], and explicitly embrace an empirical self-help philosophy; "the role of positive psychology is to become a bridge between the ivory tower and the main street—between the rigor of academe and the fun of the self-help movement."&lt;ref&gt;Tal Ben-Shachar, "Giving Positive Psychology Away" in C. R. Snyder et al, ''Positive Psychology'' (Sage 2010) p. 503&lt;/ref&gt; They aim to refine the self-improvement field by way of an intentional increase in scientifically sound research and well-engineered models. The division of focus and methodologies has produced several subfields, in particular: general positive psychology, focusing primarily on the study of psychological phenomenon and effects; and [[personal effectiveness]], focusing primarily on analysis, design and implementation of qualitative personal growth. This includes the intentional training of new patterns of thought and feeling. As business strategy communicator [[Don Tapscott]] puts it, "The design industry is something done to us. I'm proposing we each become designers. But I suppose 'I love the way she thinks' could take on new meaning."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_7.html Edge.org question center: Scientific concepts and cognitive toolkits, page 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both self-talk, the propensity to engage in verbal or mental self-directed conversation and thought, and social support can be used as instruments of self-improvement, often by empowering, action-promoting messages. Psychologists have designed series of experiments that are intended to shed light into how self-talk can result in self-improvement. In general, research has shown that people prefer to use second person pronouns over first person pronouns when engaging in self-talk to achieve goals, regulate one’s own behavior, thoughts, or emotions, and facilitate performance.&lt;ref&gt;Gammage, K. L., Hardy, J., &amp; Hall, C. G. (2001). A description of self-talk in exercise. Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 2, 233–247&lt;/ref&gt; If self-talk has the expected effect, then writing about personal problems using language from their friends’ perspective should result in greater amount of motivational and emotional benefits comparing to using language from their own perspective. When you need to finish a difficult task and you are not willing to do something to finish this task, trying to write a few sentence or goals imaging what your friends have told you gives you more motivational resources comparing to you write to yourself. Research done by Ireland and others have revealed that, as expected, when people are writing using many physical and mental words or even typing a standard prompt with these kinds of words, adopting a friend’s perspective while freely writing about a personal challenge can help increase people’s intention to improve self-control by promoting the positivity of emotions such as pride and satisfaction, which can motivate people to reach their goal.&lt;ref&gt;Ireland et al. (2014). A Friend to Myself: Thinking of a Friend in Self-Talk Strengthens Intentions to Improve Self-Control. Manuscript under review.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of self-talk goes beyond the scope of self-improvement for performing certain activities, self-talk as a linguistic form of self-help also plays a very important role in regulating people’s emotions under social stress. First of all, people using non-first-person language tend to exhibit higher level of visual self-distancing during the process of introspection, indicating that using non-first-person pronouns and one’s own name may result in enhanced self-distancing.&lt;ref&gt;Mischowski, D., Kross, E., &amp; Bushman, B. (2012). Flies on the wall are less aggressive: The effect of self-distancing on aggressive affect, cognition, and behavior. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 48, 1187–1191. doi:10.1016/j.jesp.2012.03.012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kross, E. 2014"&gt;Kross, E., Bruehlman-Senecal, E., Park, J., Burson, A., Dougherty, A., Shablack, H., &amp; Ayduk, O. (2014). Self-talk as a regulatory mechanism: How you do it matters. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 106(2), 304&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, this specific form of self-help also has been found can enhance people’s ability to regulate their thoughts, feelings, and behavior under social stress, which would lead them to appraise social-anxiety-provoking events in more challenging and less threatening terms. Additionally, these self-help behaviors also demonstrate noticeable self-regulatory effects through the process of social interactions, regardless of their dispositional vulnerability to social anxiety.&lt;ref name="Kross, E. 2014"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Scholars have targeted self-help claims as misleading and incorrect. In 2005 Steve Salerno portrayed the American self-help movement—he uses the acronym ''SHAM: the Self-Help and Actualization Movement''—not only as ineffective in achieving its goals, but also as socially harmful.&lt;ref name="Salerno 2005"/&gt; "Salerno says that 80 percent of self-help and motivational customers are repeat customers and they keep coming back 'whether the program worked for them or not'."&lt;ref&gt;Vicki Kunkel, ''Instant Appeal'' (2009) p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Others similarly point out that with [[self-help books]] "supply increases the demand... The more people read them, the more they think they need them... more like an addiction than an alliance."&lt;ref&gt;R. J. McAllister, ''Emotion: Mystery or Madness?'' (2007) pp. 156–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-help writers have been described as working "in the area of the ideological, the imagined, the narrativized.... although a veneer of scientism permeates the[ir] work, there is also an underlying armature of moralizing."&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Buckley (novelist)|Christopher Buckley]] in his book ''God is My Broker'' asserts: "The only way to get rich from a self-help book is to write one".&lt;ref name=balance&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckley|first=C|title=''God Is My Broker'', ''A Monk-Tycoon Reveals the 7 1/2 Laws of Spiritual and Financial Growth''|year=1998|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-06-097761-0|pages=Page 185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Gerald M. Rosen reported that people do not gain as much from reading self-help material as people would from the same material received in therapy. In general, he was critical of proliferation of self-help books.&lt;ref&gt;G. Rosen, "Self-help treatment books and the commercialization of psychotherapy", ''American Psychologist'', vol. 42, no. 1, 1987, 46-51&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
[[Kathryn Schulz]] suggests that "the underlying theory of the self-help industry is contradicted by the self-help industry’s existence".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parodies and fictional analogies===
The self-help world has become the target of [[parody|parodies]]. [[Walker Percy]]'s odd genre-busting ''[[Lost in the Cosmos]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Lost in the Cosmos: The Last Self-Help Book''. New York: Farrar, Straus, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; has been described as "a parody of self-help books, a philosophy textbook, and a collection of short stories, quizzes, diagrams, thought experiments, mathematical formulas, made-up dialogue".&lt;ref&gt;
[http://chronicle.com/blogPost/Walker-Percys-Weirdest-Book/23835/ Walker Percy's Weirdest Book]&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2006 book ''Secrets of The Superoptimist'', authors W.R. Morton and Nathanel Whitten revealed the concept of "superoptimism" as a humorous antidote to the overblown self-help book category.  In his comedy special ''[[Complaints and Grievances]]'' (2001), [[George Carlin]] observes that there is "no such thing" as self-help: anyone looking for help from someone else does not technically get "self" help; and one who accomplishes something without help, did not need help to begin with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video
  | people = Carlin, George
  | title = Complaints and Grievances
  | medium = DVD
  | publisher = Atlantic Records
  | location =
  | date = 2001-11-17}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Margaret Atwood]]'s semi-satiric dystopia ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'', university literary studies have declined to the point that the protagonist, Snowman, is instructed to write his thesis on self-help books as literature; more revealing of the authors and of the society that produced them than genuinely helpful.

'''Sheikh Zayed Foundation,''' is a non-profit organization that was created in 1993 in [[Rabat]]. It focuses on the health sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://adala.justice.gov.ma/production/html/Fr/77540.htm|title=Dahir portant loi n° 1-93-228 du 22 rebia I 1414 (10 septembre 1993) créant la Fondation « Cheikh Zaïd Ibn Soltan »|website=adala.justice.gov.ma|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation aims at contributing to the Moroccan university-hospital sphere as well as ensuring quality social services oriented towards future health practitioners. It is named after [[Sheikh]] [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], Emir of [[Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi]], founder and first president of the [[United Arab Emirates]].

The activities of the foundation are represented by four essential components: Medical care, teaching, research and medical support for populations in difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fcz.ma/fondation-cheikh-zaid/|title=FONDATION CHEIKH ZAID|website=www.fcz.ma|language=fr|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These components strengthen the health sector in Morocco and actively contribute to the improvement of treatments, hospital infrastructure and medical equipment.

== History ==
The Sheikh Zayed Foundation was established in Rabat on September 10, 1993, by King Hassan II and Sheikh Zayed Ibn Sultan Al-Nahyan under a private non-profit model. The foundation was created by ([[Moroccan Dahir|Dahir]]) Royal Decree-Law No. 1-93-228 with an initial donation of $50 million by the Emirati Sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.leconomiste.com/article/958988-rabat-une-universite-des-sciences-de-la-sante|title=Rabat: Une université des sciences de la santé|date=2016-02-28|work=L'Economiste|access-date=2017-12-21|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vision of the foundation is based on the principles of excellence, solidarity and respect for differences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economie-entreprises.com/hcz-une-reference-sanitaire/|title=HCZ, une référence sanitaire|date=2014-03-16|work=Economie Entreprises|access-date=2017-12-21|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2003, the foundation put in place a development program focused on launching new medical, education and training institutions. This new strategy aims to gradually strengthen the presence of its components throughout Morocco.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2016, the foundation announces the launching of a genetic research center in partnership with UIASS and the institute of Genetic Diseases "Imagine" of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fr.le360.ma/societe/fondation-cheikh-zaid-lancement-dun-centre-de-recherche-en-genetique-74891|title=Fondation cheikh Zaid: lancement d'un Centre de recherche en génétique|work=fr.le360.ma|access-date=2017-12-21|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation is made up of five healthcare facilities, one university campus with a training capacity in the form of three faculties and two institutes of higher education, three research centers, one center of bioequivalence studies, and several mobile care units. The Sheikh Zayed foundation organized the first African Health Forum that took place in May 2015. The forum focused on the theme of HIV, with the presence of [[Françoise Barré-Sinoussi|the medicine Nobel prize winner Françoise Barré-Sinoussi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://afrique.lepoint.fr/sante-le-1er-forum-africain-avec-la-fondation-cheikh-zaid-19-05-2015-1929387_2254.php|title=1er Forum africain sur la Santé : Françoise Barré-Sinoussi à l'honneur|work=Le Point Afrique|access-date=2017-12-21|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation’s governance ==
In 2003, the [[Mohammed VI of Morocco|King Mohammed VI]] appointed [[Mounir Majidi]] as the president of the Sheikh Zayed foundation. Mounir Majidi implemented a new economic model for the foundation to regain balance and financial autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://maghreb-info.com/mounir-el-majidi-le-sujet-economique-de-mohammed-vi/|title=Mounir Majidi : Tout savoir sur le sujet économique de Mohamed VI|date=2014-10-16|work=Maghreb info|access-date=2017-12-21|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003 to 2016, the foundation’s turnover went from 2.9 million euros to 58.2 million euros, with an average annual growth of 26%. The foundation yields 5.5 million euros per year, a net result fully reinvested in infrastructural development.

'''Steve de Shazer''' (June 25, 1940, [[Milwaukee]] &amp;ndash; September 11, 2005, [[Vienna]]) was a [[psychotherapy|psychotherapist]], [[author]], and developer and pioneer of [[solution focused brief therapy]].  In 1978, he founded the [[Brief Family Therapy Center]] (BFTC) in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] with his wife [[Insoo Kim Berg]].

He wrote six significant books, translated into 14 languages; wrote many papers; and lectured internationally.

De Shazer was originally trained as a classical musician and worked as a jazz saxophonist. He received a Bachelor in Fine Arts and an MSSW in Social Work from the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]].  He never studied at the [[Mental Research Institute]] in Palo Alto, [[California]], even though some rumours have it he did. He was a lifelong friend of [[John Weakland]] though, and saw him as his mentor.

De Shazer died in Vienna while traveling on a training and consulting tour in Europe. De Shazer has a nephew, Tony de Shazer and two great nieces Elodie and Amelie de Shazer.

A '''stress ball''' or '''hand exercise ball''' is a malleable toy, usually not more than 7&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter, which is squeezed in the hand and manipulated by the fingers, ostensibly to relieve [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] and muscle tension or to exercise the muscles of the hand.

Despite the name, many stress balls are not spherical. Some are molded in amusing shapes, and pad- or transfer-printed with corporate logos. They are presented to employees and clients of companies as [[promotional gifts]]. Stress balls are the third most popular promotional gift in the United Kingdom.{{when?|date=January 2017}} Because of the many non-spherical shapes now available, stress balls are generically known as stress relievers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bongo.com.au/product_cat/stress-balls/|title=Stress Balls|website=Bongo|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Packing up the stress balls at work. (5103481674).jpg|thumb|A selection of foam-rubber stress relievers]]
There are several different types of stress balls that originate from many different countries. The most common type of stress ball in America is the “bean bag” type, commonly known as a “Hacky Sack”. The stress ball that is most common in Australia is the foam type, this type prevents stress through resistance from squeezing the ball. The third type of stress ball is the Chinese form known as the [[Baoding balls|Baoding ball]]. These are not like the others as these are not squeezable, they are solid, they usually come in pairs so you can roll them together to make a soothing sound and a smooth sensation feeling in your hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/4756/1/Reduce-Your-Stress-With-Stress-Balls.html|title=Reduce Your Stress With Stress Balls|website=www.healthguidance.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some stress relievers are made from closed-cell polyurethane [[foam rubber]]. These are made by injecting the liquid components of the foam into a mold. The resulting chemical reaction creates carbon dioxide bubbles as a byproduct, which in turn creates the foam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stressballs.gb.com/info/stressfaq.html|title=Stress Ball FAQs|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215101551/http://www.stressballs.gb.com/info/stressfaq.html|archivedate=Feb 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stress balls, especially those used in [[physical therapy]], can also contain [[gel]] of different densities inside a rubber or cloth skin. Another type uses a thin rubber membrane surrounding a fine powder. The latter type can be made at home by filling a balloon with [[baking soda]]. Some balls similar to a [[footbag]] are marketed and used as stress balls.

|Prior to 1888||[[Traditional African medicine|Tribal medicine]] is performed in the territory.

|-
|1888–1962||Under [[British Kenya|British rule]], modern hospitals start to be founded, beginning with [[Mombasa Hospital]] and [[Kenyatta National Hospital]]. User fees are introduced in all public facilities.&lt;ref name=Table1&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= |date= |title=Table1 - Development of health care financing policies in Kenya |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3129586/table/T1/ |journal=International Journal for Equity in Health |publisher= |volume= 10|issue= |pages= 22|doi=10.1186/1475-9276-10-22 |pmc= 3129586|pmid= 21612669|accessdate=17 July 2016 |year=2011 | last1 = Chuma | first1 = J | last2 = Okungu | first2 = V}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
|-
|1963–1980s||After independence from [[British empire|Great Britain]], Kenya works with the purpose of attaining a universal healthcare system. Notwithstanding uneven results, in this period the number of healthcare facilities quadruple and life expectancy extends from 40 to 62 years. Child survival rates also improve.&lt;ref name=kenya-health&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartglobalhealth.org/pages/kenya-mission/kenya-health|title=Kenya: The Big Picture on Health|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|1990s–2000s||Both a previous economic crisis and the intensification of the HIV/AIDS epidemics in Africa hit dramatically the Kenyan population and many past achievements and improvements are reversed. Life expectancy declines and infant mortality increases.&lt;ref name=kenya-health/&gt;
|-
|2000s–present||Adult HIV prevalence starts to fall and an increasing financial support from donors stop the reversal of health rates.

==Causes==
[[File:Tonsillitis cause.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Bacteria or viruses can cause tonsillitis.]]
The most common cause is viral infection and includes [[adenovirus]], [[rhinovirus]], [[influenza]], [[coronavirus]], and [[respiratory syncytial virus]].&lt;ref name=merck/&gt;&lt;ref name=wetmore/&gt;&lt;ref name=thuma/&gt;&lt;ref name=simon/&gt; It can also be caused by [[Epstein-Barr virus]], [[herpes simplex virus]], [[cytomegalovirus]], or [[HIV]].&lt;ref name=merck/&gt;&lt;ref name=wetmore/&gt;&lt;ref name=thuma/&gt;&lt;ref name=simon/&gt;  The second most common cause is bacterial infection of which the predominant is Group A β-hemolytic streptococcus ([[GABHS]]), which causes [[strep throat]].&lt;ref name=merck/&gt;&lt;ref name=wetmore/&gt;&lt;ref name=thuma/&gt;&lt;ref name=simon/&gt;  Less common bacterial causes include: ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA ),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brook |first=I. |last2=Foote |first2=P. A. |title=Isolation of methicillin resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' from the surface and core of tonsils in children |journal=Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol |year=2006 |volume=70 |issue=12 |pages=2099–2102 |pmid=16962178 |doi=10.1016/j.ijporl.2006.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Chlamydia pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Bordetella pertussis]]'', ''[[Fusobacterium]]'' sp., ''[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]'', ''[[Treponema pallidum]]'', and ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]''.&lt;ref name=merck/&gt;&lt;ref name=wetmore/&gt;&lt;ref name=thuma/&gt;&lt;ref name=simon/&gt;

[[Anaerobic bacteria]] have been implicated in tonsillitis and a possible role in the acute inflammatory process is supported by several clinical and scientific observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brook |first=I. |title=The role of anaerobic bacteria in tonsillitis |journal=Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol |year=2005 |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=9–19 |doi=10.1016/j.ijporl.2004.08.007 |pmid=15627441 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under normal circumstances, as viruses and bacteria enter the body through the nose and mouth, they are filtered in the [[tonsil]]s.&lt;ref name="Kempen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry"/&gt; Within the tonsils, [[white blood cell]]s of the immune system destroy the viruses or bacteria by producing inflammatory cytokines like [[phospholipase A2]],&lt;ref name="pmid22297210"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ezzeddini R, Darabi M, Ghasemi B, Jabbari Moghaddam Y, Jabbari Y, Abdollahi S, etal | title=Circulating phospholipase-A2 activity in obstructive sleep apnea and recurrent tonsillitis. | journal=Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol | year= 2012 | volume= 76 | issue= 4 | pages= 471–4 | pmid=22297210 | doi=10.1016/j.ijporl.2011.12.026 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=22297210  }}&lt;/ref&gt; which also lead to fever.&lt;ref name="Kempen"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Kempen MJ, Rijkers GT, Van Cauwenberge PB |title=The immune response in adenoids and tonsils |journal=Int.

Sometimes, tonsillitis is caused by an [[infection]] of [[spirochaeta]] and [[treponema]], in this case called Vincent's angina or Plaut-Vincent angina.&lt;ref name="pmid1015288"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Van Cauwenberge P |title=[Significance of the fusospirillum complex (Plaut-Vincent angina)] |language=Dutch |journal=Acta Otorhinolaryngol Belg |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=334–45 |year=1976 |pmid=1015288 }} — fusospirillum complex (Plaut-Vincent angina) Van Cauwenberge studied the tonsils of 126 patients using direct microscope observation.  The results showed that 40% of acute tonsillitis was caused by Vincent's angina and 27% of chronic tonsillitis was caused by Spirochaeta&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Throat Culture.png|thumbnail|upright=1.3|Throat swab.]]

The diagnosis of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) tonsillitis can be confirmed by culture of samples obtained by swabbing both tonsillar surfaces and the posterior pharyngeal wall and plating them on sheep [[blood agar]] medium.  The isolation rate can be increased by incubating the cultures under [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] conditions and using [[growth media|selective growth media]]. A single throat culture has a sensitivity of 90–95% for the detection of GABHS (which means that GABHS is actually present 5–10% of the time culture suggests that it is absent). This small percentage of false-negative results are part of the characteristics of the tests used but are also possible if the patient has received antibiotics prior to testing. Identification requires 24 to 48 hours by culture but rapid screening tests (10–60 minutes), which have a sensitivity of 85–90%, are available. Older antigen tests detect the surface Lancefield group A carbohydrate. Newer tests identify GABHS serotypes using nucleic acid (DNA) probes or [[polymerase chain reaction]]. Bacterial culture may need to be performed in cases of a negative rapid streptococcal test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leung AK, Newman R, Kumar A, Davies HD | year = 2006 | title = Rapid antigen detection testing in diagnosing group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis | url = | journal = Expert Rev Mol Diagn | volume = 6 | issue = 5| pages = 761–6 | doi = 10.1586/14737159.6.5.761 | pmid = 17009909 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

True infection with GABHS, rather than colonization, is defined arbitrarily as the presence of &gt;10 colonies of GABHS per blood agar plate. However, this method is difficult to implement because of the overlap between carriers and infected patients. An increase in antistreptolysin O ([[Anti-streptolysin O|ASO]]) streptococcal antibody titer 3–6 weeks following the acute infection can provide retrospective evidence of GABHS infection&lt;ref name="BrookOvercoming"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brook I | year = 2007 | title = Overcoming penicillin failures in the treatment of Group A streptococcal pharyngo-tonsillitis | url = | journal = Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol | volume = 71 | issue = 10| pages = 1501–8 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijporl.2007.06.006 | pmid = 17644191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is considered definitive proof of GABHS infection.

Increased values of secreted [[phospholipase A2]]&lt;ref name="pmid22297210"/&gt; and altered [[fatty acid metabolism]]&lt;ref name="pmid23643333"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ezzedini R, Darabi M, Ghasemi B, Darabi M, Fayezi S, Moghaddam YJ, etal | title=Tissue fatty acid composition in obstructive sleep apnea and recurrent tonsillitis | journal=Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol | year= 2013 | volume=  77| issue=  6| pages=  1008–12| pmid=23643333 | doi=10.1016/j.ijporl.2013.03.033 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=23643333  }}&lt;/ref&gt; in patients with tonsillitis may have diagnostic utility.

When tonsillitis is caused by a virus, the length of illness depends on which virus is involved. Usually, a complete recovery is made within one week; however, symptoms may last for up to two weeks.

===Antibiotics===
If the tonsillitis is caused by [[Streptococcus#Group A|group A streptococcus]], then [[antibiotics]] are useful, with [[penicillin]] or [[amoxicillin]] being primary choices.&lt;ref name="pmid1459378"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Touw-Otten FW, Johansen KS |title=Diagnosis, antibiotic treatment and outcome of acute tonsillitis: report of a WHO Regional Office for Europe study in 17 European countries |journal=Fam Pract |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=255–62 |year=1992 |pmid=1459378 |doi=10.1093/fampra/9.3.255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cephalosporins and macrolides are considered good alternatives to penicillin in the acute setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Casey JR, Pichichero ME | year = 2004 | title = Meta-analysis of cephalosporin versus penicillin treatment of group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis in children | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 113 | issue = 4| pages = 866–882 | doi = 10.1542/peds.113.4.866 | pmid = 15060239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[macrolide]] such as [[erythromycin]] is used for people allergic to penicillin.

==Prognosis==
Since the advent of penicillin in the 1940s, a major preoccupation in the treatment of streptococcal tonsillitis has been the prevention of [[rheumatic fever]], and its major effects on the nervous system ([[Sydenham's chorea]]) and heart. Recent evidence would suggest that the rheumatogenic strains of group A beta hemolytic strep have become markedly less prevalent and are now only present in small pockets such as in Salt Lake City, USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Temporal changes in streptococcal M protein types and the near-disappearance of acute rheumatic fever in the United States |vauthors=Shulman ST, Stollerman G, Beall B, Dale JB, Tanz RR | date=Feb 15, 2006 | journal=Clin Infect Dis | volume=42 | pages=441–7 | pmid=16421785 | doi=10.1086/499812| issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This brings into question the rationale for treating tonsillitis as a means of preventing rheumatic fever.

Complications may rarely include dehydration and kidney failure due to difficulty swallowing, blocked airways due to inflammation, and [[pharyngitis]] due to the spread of infection.&lt;ref name=merck/&gt;&lt;ref name=wetmore/&gt;&lt;ref name=thuma/&gt;&lt;ref name=simon/&gt;&lt;ref name=medline/&gt;

An [[abscess]] may develop lateral to the tonsil during an infection, typically several days after the onset of tonsillitis. This is termed a [[peritonsillar abscess]] (or quinsy).

Rarely, the infection may spread beyond the tonsil resulting in inflammation and infection of the [[internal jugular vein]] giving rise to a spreading [[septicaemia]] infection ([[Lemierre's syndrome]]).

In chronic/recurrent cases (generally defined as seven episodes of tonsillitis in the preceding year, five episodes in each of the preceding two years or three episodes in each of the preceding three years),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Management of Sore Throat and Indications for Tonsillectomy | url=http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/34/index.html | chapter=6.3 Referral Criteria for Tonsillectomy | chapterurl=http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/34/section6.html | publisher=Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network- Health care Scotland | isbn=1-899893-66-0 | date=January 1999 | author=Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011030833/http://www.sign.ac.uk/guidelines/fulltext/34/index.html | archivedate=2006-10-11 | df= }} — notes though that these criteria "have been arrived at arbitrarily" from:&lt;br&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Paradise JL, Bluestone CD, Bachman RZ, etal |title=Efficacy of tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection in severely affected children.

The '''Volgograd Reservoir''' ({{lang-ru|Волгоградское водохранилище}}) is a [[reservoir]] in [[Russia]] formed at the [[Volga River]] by the dam of the [[Volga Hydroelectric Station]]. It lies within the [[Volgograd Oblast]] and [[Saratov Oblast]] and named after the city of [[Volgograd]]. It was constructed during 1958-1961.

Its area is 3,117&amp;nbsp;km², volume is 31,5&amp;nbsp;km³, length is 540&amp;nbsp;km, maximal width is 17&amp;nbsp;km, average depth is  10.1 m. It is the third largest reservoir on [[Volga]] in Russia (after [[Kuybyshev Reservoir]] and [[Rybinsk Reservoir]]).

'''Warfarin resistance''' is a rare condition in which people have varying degrees of tolerance to the anticoagulant drug [[warfarin]]. In incomplete warfarin resistance, people only respond to high doses of warfarin; in complete warfarin resistance, the drug has no effect. This can be because the drug is metabolized quickly or because the [[clotting cascade]] does not interact with warfarin as it should. One gene that has been identified in warfarin resistance is [[VKORC1]], a gene responsible for warfarin metabolism. It is inherited in an [[autosomal dominant]] pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/warfarin-resistance |title = Warfarin resistance |date = July 2015 |work = Genetics Home Reference |publisher = National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;
