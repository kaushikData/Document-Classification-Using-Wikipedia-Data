[[Image:2dfgrs.png|right|thumb|300px|Rendering of the 2dFGRS data]]
In [[astronomy]], the '''2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey''' (Two-degree-Field Galaxy Redshift Survey), '''2dF''' or '''2dFGRS''' is a [[redshift survey]] conducted by the [[Anglo-Australian Observatory]] (AAO) with the 3.9m [[Anglo-Australian Telescope]] between 1997 and 11 April 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.aao.gov.au/~TDFgg/Public/Survey/Overview/sld013.htm Final Status of Survey Observations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304135713/http://www2.aao.gov.au/~TDFgg/Public/Survey/Overview/sld013.htm |date=March 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The data from this survey were made public on 30 June 2003.  The survey determined the large-scale structure in two large slices of the Universe to a depth of around 2.5 billion light years ([[redshift]] ~ 0.2).  It was the world's largest redshift survey between 1998 (overtaking Las Campanas Redshift Survey) and 2003 (overtaken by the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]]).  Matthew Colless, Steve Maddox and [[John A. Peacock|John Peacock]] were in charge of the project. Team members [[Shaun Cole]] and John Peacock were awarded a share of the 2014 [[Shaw Prize]] in astronomy for results from the 2dFGRS.

== Description ==
The 2dF survey covered an area of about 1500 [[square degree]]s, surveying regions in both the north and the south [[galactic pole]]s.&lt;ref name="AAO's 2dF Intro"&gt;[http://www2.aao.gov.au/~TDFgg/Public/Survey/description.html 2dFGRS − An Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304173850/http://www2.aao.gov.au/~TDFgg/Public/Survey/description.html |date=2007-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name derives from the fact that the survey instrument has a 2 degree diameter field of view.

The areas selected for observation were previously surveyed by the massive [[APM Galaxy Survey]] (on which Steve Maddox also worked).&lt;ref name="AAO's 2dF Intro" /&gt; The regions surveyed cover roughly 75 degrees of [[right ascension]] for both bands, and the [[declination]] of the North Polar band was about 7.5 degrees while the declination of the South Polar band was about 15 degrees. Hundreds of isolated two degree fields near the South Polar band were also surveyed (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20070304232459/http://www2.aao.gov.au/~TDFgg/Public/Survey/Overview/img009.GIF this illustration], where black circles represent survey fields, and the red grid represents the earlier APM survey).

In total, the [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] of 382,323 objects were measured, which includes [[spectrum|spectra]] for 245,591 objects, of which 232,155 were [[galaxies]] (221,414 with good quality spectra), 12,311 are [[star]]s, and 125 are [[quasi-stellar object]]s (quasars).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.aao.gov.au/~TDFgg/Public/Survey/statusfinal.html 2dFGRS Summary Statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304232530/http://www2.aao.gov.au/~TDFgg/Public/Survey/statusfinal.html |date=2007-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The survey necessitated 272 required nights of observation, spread over 5 years.

The survey was carried out with the 4 metre [[Anglo-Australian Telescope]], with the '''2dF instrument''' installed at the primary focus permitting the observation of a field of 2 degrees per pointing.  The instrument possesses a [[spectrograph]] equipped with two banks each of 200 optical fibres, permitting the simultaneous measurement of 400 spectra.

The limiting apparent magnitude of the survey is 19.5, covering objects with a [[redshift]] mostly within less than z=0.3 and a median [[redshift]] of 0.11.  The volume of the Universe covered by the survey is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; [[Megaparsec|Mpc]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''h'' corresponds to the value of the [[Hubble constant]], ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, divided by 100. ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is approximately 70&amp;nbsp;km/s/Mpc.  The largest [[redshift]] observed by the survey corresponds to a distance of 600 ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc.

== Survey Results ==

The principal results obtained for the field of [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]] by the 2dF survey are:

* The measurement of the [[density parameter]] of [[Nonrelativistic|non-relativistic matter]] ([[baryonic matter]] plus [[dark matter]] plus massive [[neutrinos]])
* The detection of [[Baryon acoustic oscillations]], and as a consequence the relationship between the density of baryonic matter and dark matter
* Limits on the contribution of massive neutrinos to dark matter, putting a limit on the sum of the masses of the three families of neutrinos at 1.8 eV.

All these results are in agreement with the measurements of other experiments, notably those of [[WMAP]].  They confirm the [[Lambda-CDM model|standard cosmological model]].

The 2dF survey also yields a unique view on our local cosmic environment. In the figure a 3-D reconstruction of the inner parts of the survey is shown, revealing an impressive view on the cosmic structures in the nearby universe. Several [[superclusters]] stand out, such as the [[Sloan Great Wall]], one of the largest structures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wall | first = Mike | url = http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/01/11/largest-structure-in-universe-discovered/ | title = Largest structure in universe discovered | date = 2013-01-11 | publisher = [[Fox News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the universe known to date (see also [[Huge-LQG]]).

'''Abu al-Fadl Abdullah bin Muhammad bin al-Siddiq al-Ghumari''' (1910&amp;ndash;1993) was a Moroccan preacher, jurist and theologian.&lt;ref&gt;Mustafa Shah, ''The Hạdīth: Scholarship, perspectives, and criticism'', Routledge, 2010, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lineage==
The Ghumari family descends from [[Ahl al-Bayt]], the family of the Islamic [[Prophets in Islam|prophet]] [[Muhammad]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Ghumari's bloodline is traced through his father Muhammad, son of Muhammad, son of Ahmad, son of Muhammad, son of Qasim, son of Muhammad, son of Muhammad, son of Abd al-Mu`min, son of Muhammad, son of Abd al-Mu`min, son of Ali, son of al-Hasan, son of Muhammad, son of Abdullah, son of Ahmad, son of Abdullah, son of Isa, son of Mas'ud, son of al-Fudayl, son of [[Ali ibn Umar]], son of Umar, son of al-Arabi Alal, son of Musa, son of Ahmad, son of Dawud, son of [[Idris II of Fes]], son of [[Idris I of Morocco]], son of Abdullah, son of al-Hasan al-Muthana, son of [[Hasan ibn Ali]], son of [[Ali]] and [[Fatimah]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

==Life==
Ghumari was born in the Moroccan city of [[Tangier]] in 1910, and died in the same city in 1993.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;The Biography of Abu al Fadl Abdullah bin as-Siddiq al-Ghumari who died in the year 1413AH, written and translated by Riad Nachef. Available at:&lt;br&gt;*[http://www.ayouby.com/biography/english-translations/623-sheikh-abdullah-bin-as-siddiq-al-ghumari-.html Ayouby.com]&lt;br&gt;*[http://www.riadnachef.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=113:the-biogaphy-of-abu-alfadl-abdullah-bin-as-siddiq-al-ghumari-&amp;catid=56:english-text&amp;Itemid=77 Riad Nachef, Islamic Affairs]&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, he was primarily educated by his father Muhammad bin al-Siddiq al-Ghumari, also an Islamic scholar. The younger Ghumari [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorized]] the entirety of the [[Qur'an]] at an early age, in addition to the [[Hadith]] book [[Bulugh al-Maram]] along with [[Alfiya]] and [[Ajārūmīya]] in [[Arabic grammar]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Ghumari later travelled to [[Fes|Fas]] for his higher education, but then enrolled in the [[University of al-Karaouine]]. While there, he also studied [[Mosque of Uqba]],&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] and important seat of Muslim religious learning.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.discoverislamicart.org/pc_item.php?id=monument%3BISL%3Btn%3BMon01%3B2%3Ben Great Mosque of Kairouan (discoverislamicart.org)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407201059/http://www.discoverislamicart.org/pc_item.php?id=monument%3BISL%3Btn%3BMon01%3B2%3Ben |date=2013-04-07 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; During his study, Ghumari's teachers covered a number of books considered canonical in Sunni Islam, [[Al-Qastallani]]'s explanation of [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and the works of [[Khalil ibn Ishaq al-Jundi]] being two examples.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Eventually, Ghumari switched from Karaouine to [[Al-Azhar University]] in 1930 and graduating the next year. During his education, Ghumari was a student of [[Al-Kawthari]], of whom Ghumari would later hold extremely negative views.&lt;ref name=haddad&gt;[[Gibril Haddad]], [http://www.abc.se/home/m9783/ir/f/The%20Ghumari%20School.htm The Ghumari School]. 6 December 2002: Living Islam. Last updated 2 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to fears in the wider [[Arab world]] regarding the influence of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in the mid-twentieth century, Ghumari was accused of having ties to a foreign group.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} In 1961, he was sentenced to ten years in prison, likely due to his time spent in Egypt where the Brotherhood had formed. Hi{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}s older brother, [[Ahmad al-Ghumari]], fell ill upon hearing of his younger brother's long sentence and died eight months later.

==Career==
Like most of the Ghumari family, Abdullah al-Ghumari was a prolific writer. 

Ghumari was famous not only for the number of teachers which he had, but also the number of students. [[Salâh Ud Dîn At Tijânî]] and [[Muhammad bin Yahya al-Ninowy]] is counted as one of Ghumari's more prominent students,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alburujpress.com/teachers/teacher/50/ Shaykh Muhammad Bin Yahya An-Ninowy]. 2009: Al Buruj Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130216221958/http://www.thedeeninstitute.com/about-us/our-team/item/75-shaykh-muhammad-al-ninowy-senior-instructor Shaykh Muhammad al-Ninowy: Senior Instructor].

An '''albedo feature''' is a large area on the surface of a [[planet]] (or other [[solar system]] body) which shows a contrast in brightness or darkness ([[albedo]]) with adjacent areas.

Historically, albedo features were the very first (and usually only) features to be seen and named on [[Mars]] and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].  Early classical maps (such as those of [[Giovanni Schiaparelli|Schiaparelli]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Willy Ley|Ley, Willy]] and [[Wernher von Braun|von Braun, Wernher]] ''The Exploration of Mars'' New York:1956 The Viking Press Pages 70-71 Schiaparelli's original map of Mars&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eugène Antoniadi|Antoniadi]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-423/p15a.htm Antoniadi's map of Mercury]&lt;/ref&gt;) showed only albedo features, and it was not until the arrival of [[space probe]]s that other surface features such as [[Impact crater|crater]]s could be seen.

On bodies other than Mars and Mercury, an albedo feature is sometimes called a regio.

On bodies with a very thick atmosphere like [[Venus]] or [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], permanent albedo features cannot be seen using ordinary optical telescopes because the surface is not visible, and only clouds and other transient atmospheric phenomena are seen. The ''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'' probe observed [[List of geological features on Titan#Albedo features|multiple albedo features]] on Titan after its arrival in [[Saturn]]'s orbit in 2004.

The very first albedo feature ever seen on another planet was [[Syrtis Major Planum]] on Mars in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Mapping Mars: Science, Imagination, and the Birth of a World| first=Oliver| last=Morton| publisher=Picador USA| location=New York| year=2002| isbn=0-312-24551-3| pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uapress.arizona.edu/onlinebks/mars/chap02.htm|title=The Planet Mars: A History of Observation and Discovery - Chapter 2: Pioneers|author=William Sheehan|accessdate=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, thanks to space probes, very high-resolution images of surface features on Mars and Mercury are available, and the classical nomenclature based on albedo features has fallen somewhat into disuse. It is however still used for Earth-based observing of Mars by [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomer]]s.

However, for some Solar System bodies (such as [[Pluto]] prior to the [[New Horizons]] mission), the best available images show only albedo features.  These images were usually taken by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] or by ground-based telescopes using [[adaptive optics]].

[[Cydonia Mensae]] on Mars is an example of an albedo feature.

The '''Arboricultural Association''' is the largest body in the UK for the [[amenity tree]] [[tree care|care]] professional ([[arboriculturalist]]s).

==Structure==
There are over 2300 Arboricultural Association members and is recognised by local Government, the RHS and increasingly the general public as the focal point for best practice in arboriculture . It has a membership program linked to the [[Qualifications and Credit Framework]] It is represented on a number of national bodies including the [[Tree Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trees.org.uk/about-us/background_information|title=Background Information|publisher=Arboricultural Association | accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a registered charity, charity number 1083845.

It is situated on the B4008 in [[Standish, Gloucestershire|Stroud Green]], north of [[Stonehouse, Gloucestershire|Stonehouse]].
The address is The Malthouse, Stroud Green, Standish, Stonehouse, Gloucestershire GL10 3DL

==Function==
It regulates the education and qualifications of tree surgeons in the UK.
The Arboriculture Association continually strives to raise awareness of the importance of urban and amenity trees and gives a voice to everyone working within the wide and varied industry. Working with the Arboriculture Association allows the progression of the disciplines of arboriculture and makes our villages, towns and cities greener.
Membership with the AA provides support and benefits which are tailored to the members needs as they progress through a career in arboriculture. Members have access to a wide range of benefits, along with the opportunity to get involved with the key developments and decisions in the industry and make their voices heard.

==History==
The AA was founded in 1964 as a scientific and educational organisation, keen to promote the care and value of trees in no forest settings. The passion for trees shown by the founders at that time continues to exist in our Board and members today. 
Following initial discussions between Keith Ross, Don Wells and other interested parties, the Arboricultural Association is formed, and in the same year the Association of British Tree Surgeons and Arborists (ABTSA) is also formed.
In May 1965 Issue 1 of Volume 1 of The Arboricultural Association Journal was published. In this year the AA was also involved in developing new tree-related standards and documents including BS3936:1965 Nursery Stock - Trees and Shrubs; BS3998:1966 ‘Recommendations for Tree Work’ and BS4043:1966 Semi-Mature Trees. The first AA Advisory Leaflet ‘Tree Preservation Orders’ is also published.
In 1974 at the Arboricultural Annual Conference at Merrist Wood College, the AA and ABTSA formally merge to become the ‘new’ AA incorporating ABTSA. Don Wells reported that the Scottish Branch had been very active since 1971. Don Wells reported “A register of Consultants has been drawn up and well established” and that the AA were involved in preparartion of Bristish Standards for ‘Extra Heavy Trees’ and ‘Tree Roots and Construction’.

An '''automated personal assistant''' or an '''Intelligent Personal Assistant''' is a mobile [[software agent]] that can perform tasks, or services, on behalf of an individual based on a combination of user input, location awareness, and the ability to access information from a variety of online sources (such as weather conditions, traffic congestion, news, stock prices, user schedules, retail prices, etc.).

There are two types of automated personal assistants: intelligent automated assistants (for example, [[Apple Inc.|Apple’s]] [[Siri (software)|Siri]] and Tronton’s Cluzee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ann Dwyer |url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20120117/BLOGS06/120119828 |title=Giving Siri a run for her money |publisher=Crain's Chicago Business |date=2012-01-17 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which perform [[concierge]]-type tasks (e.g., making dinner reservations, purchasing event tickets, making travel arrangements) or provide information based on voice input or commands; and smart personal agents, which automatically perform management or data-handling tasks based on online information and events often without user initiation or interaction.

According to Chi-Hua Chien&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chi-hua-chien |title=Chi-Hua Chien  |publisher=CrunchBase |date=2012-01-24 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]], examples of tasks that may be performed by a smart personal agent-type of automated personal assistant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rip Empson |url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/29/three-companies-chi-hua-chien-of-kleiner-perkins-would-love-to-invest-in/ |title=Three Companies Chi-Hua Chien Of Kleiner Perkins Would Love To Invest In |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2011-07-29 |accessdate=2012-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; include schedule management (e.g., sending an alert to a dinner date that a user is running late due to traffic conditions, update schedules for both parties, and change the restaurant reservation time) and personal health management (e.g., monitoring caloric intake, heart rate and exercise regimen, then making recommendations for healthy choices).

Both types of automated personal assistant technology are enabled by the combination of [[Mobile device|mobile computing devices]], [[application programming interface]]s (APIs), and the proliferation of [[mobile apps]].  However, intelligent automated assistants are designed to perform specific, one-off tasks specified by user voice instructions, while smart personal agents perform ongoing tasks (e.g., schedule management) autonomously.{{fact|date=February 2016}}&lt;!--need to establish these are the standard definitions for these terms--&gt;

The [[analogy]] typically includes reference to the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] head of [[government]] as [[head of state]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Body politic: political metaphor and political violence |author=A. D. Harvey |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-84718-272-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the analogy may also be extended to other anatomical parts, as in political readings of [[Aesop's fable]] of "[[The Belly and the Members]]".

A later [[Europe]]an reference to the concept appears in ''The Book of the Body Politic'' (1407) by poet and court writer [[Christine de Pizan]], in which she admits having borrowed the concept from a letter of [[Plutarch]]'s to the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]] but does not mention [[John of Salisbury]]'s work, ''[[Policraticus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christine de Pizan]] ''The Book of the Body Politic'' pp.xviii-xx Kate Langdon Forhan 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of the Body Politic'' pp.3-5 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  The metaphor appears in the French language as the ''corps-état''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Baecque|first1=Antoine|others=Trans. [[Charlotte Mandell]]|title=The Body Politic: Corporeal Metaphor in Revolutionary France, 1770-1800|page=xv|year=1997|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|isbn=978-0-8047-2817-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The metaphor was elaborated in the [[Renaissance]], and subsequently, as medical knowledge based on [[Galen]] was challenged by thinkers such as [[William Harvey]].  Analogies were drawn between supposed causes of disease and disorder and their equivalents in the political field, viewed as [[Plague (disease)|plague]]s or infections that might be remedied with [[purgative|purges]] and [[Patent medicine|nostrums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Foreign bodies and the body politic: discourses of social pathology in early modern England |author=Jonathan Harris |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-521-59405-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval origins==
{{Anchor|In statehood}} The term "Body politic" (the political body of [[society]]) derives from the mediæval political concept of the '''King's two bodies''' first noted by mediaeval historian [[Ernst Kantorowicz]], as a point of theology as much as statehood. However, the person to give the concept some legal bite and codified reality, as much as legitimacy as well as Sovereignty, was the 14th century judge Sir [[William de Shareshull]] in 1351 for the offence of high treason&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration what Offences shall be adjudged Treason. Compassing the Death of the King, Queen, or their eldest Son; violating the Queen, or the King’s eldest Daughter unmarried, or his eldest Son’s Wife; levying War; adhering to the King’s Enemies; killing the Chancellor, Treasurer, or Judges in Execution of their Duty.

ITEM, Whereas divers Opinions have been before this Time in what Case Treason shall be said, and in what not; the King, at the Request of the Lords and of the Commons, hath made a Declaration in the Manner as hereafter followeth, that is to say; When a Man doth compass or imagine the Death of our Lord the King, or of our Lady his [Queen or of their eldest Son and Heir; or if a Man do violate the King’s Companion or the King’s eldest Daughter unmarried, or the Wife  the King’s eldest Son and Heir; or if a Man do levy War against our Lord the King in his Realm, or be adherent to the King’s Enemies in his Realm, giving to them Aid and Comfort in the Realm, or elsewhere, and thereof be probably] attainted of open Deed by the People] of their Condition: . . . , and if a Man slea the Chancellor, Treasurer, or the King’s Justices of the one Bench or the other, Justices in Eyre, or Justices of Assise, and all other Justices assigned to hear and determine, being in their Places, doing their Offices: And it is to be understood, that in the Cases above rehearsed, that ought to be judged Treason which extends to our Lord the King, and his Royal Majesty" Treason Act 1351 25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''1351 Treason''' Act 25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2&lt;/ref&gt; in the aftermath of the [[First Barons' War|Barons war]]. However, by the time of the fifteenth-century judge [[John Fortescue (judge)|Sir John Fortescue]] the concept moves away from theology to [[jurisprudence]] in his ''The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy'', written from exile in about 1462 . Fortescue explains that the ''character angelus'' (divine character) of the king is his royal power, derived from angels and separate from the frail physical powers of his body.  However, he uses the phrase ''body politic'' itself only in its modern sense, to describe the realm, or shared rule, of [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]], mythical first king of England, and how he and his fellow exiles had covenanted to form a body politic. Unusually for the time, Fortescue was writing in English and not Latin: "made a body pollitike callid a reawme." The early medieval period (13th century) saw a general and radical shift in the idea of the political body and sovereignty and who was to be ultimate ruler of humankind.This constant shift in [[Translatio imperii]] and ''The Halo of perpetuity''(Kantorowicz reasoning)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kings Two Bodies|last=Ernst|first=Kantorowicz|publisher=|year=1957|isbn=|location=|pages=78–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; transformed the king's persona from [[Liturgy]] to legal science, argues Kantorowicz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The King's Two Bodies|last=Kantorowicz|first=|publisher=|year=1957|isbn=|location=|pages=87–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] proved one thing, quite surprisingly enough, the king wasn't the ultimate and major landowner with just 20% of land ownership as [[William the Conqueror]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Doomsday Of Crown Lands|last=Sidney J|first=Madge|publisher=Routledge|year=1938|isbn=|location=|pages=20–21|quote="Before the Norman conquest, therefore, it is possible to find a feudal edifice of at least four stages-first, the king as supreme lord;then the holders of "bocland"with their "courts", and the power of making separate grants; next the owners of "laenland", rendering military service and special dues;and lastly, the cultivators of the land (Feudal serfs) of two types, free and unfree.This division of the land before and after the (Norman) Conquest, worked out so carefully in 1867, but expressed in percentage form for the first time, reveals the curious fact that the Church(29.6%) alone gained by the Conquest, relatively speaking, the Crown(19.9%) and the Baronage(50.5%) showing proportionate losses in the new triangular balance of power."}}&lt;/ref&gt; found out to his disgust and chagrin, which ultimately led to the [[Domesday Book|Domesday book]] being compiled. With [[Plenitudo potestatis]], [[Unam sanctam]] (a [[Papal bull]]) [[extra Ecclesiam nulla salus]] and the [[Sun and moon allegory]] now part of the armoury of jurisdictional power of the papacy with both [[Canon law]], and medieval political theology now becoming(part of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] movement beginning with [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[John of Salisbury]]) a standard bearer for medieval political power which then descended into the infamous [[Inquisition]] and [[heresy]] (deviation from truth)as the ultimate legal reality which meant both the [[Roman catholic church|Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Papal supremacy]] couldn't be ignored(not without fear of [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunication]] and in some cases judicial execution). The church, which ultimately had powerful claims to sovereignty due to their immense wealth and vast monetary resources which included a clever taxation system establishing the legal validity of the [[tithe]] system which baffled legal experts of the day of its historical lineage and origin, such as Sir [[William Blackstone]], for example, not its legal validity; such as their (the church's) enormous network and ownership of land, law making and the then-University and education system.

==Literal manifestation==
In 1550 the jurist [[Edmund Plowden]] merged Fortescue's concepts, at the same time removing them from abstraction into a real, physical manifestation in the body of the king. Plowden reports how lawyers codified this notion in an examination of a case of land-ownership turning on a disputed gift by an earlier monarch; they determined that the "Body politic…that cannot be seen or handled…[is] constituted for the direction of the People…[and] these two bodies are incorporated in one person…the Body politic includes the [king's] Body natural."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kantorowicz|first=Ernst H|authorlink=Ernst Kantorowicz|title=The King's Two Bodies: A Study in Mediaeval Political Theology|year=1957|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691071209|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1609 [[Attorney General]] [[Edward Coke]] pronounced his dissenting opinion,  that mortal power was God-made while the immortality of royal power existed only as a man-made concept; Coke later succeeded in limiting the royal power of both [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[James VI and I]] with his now infamous judgements of [[Case of Proclamations]]&lt;ref&gt;'''England and Wales High Court (King's Bench Division)''' ''Decisions Case of Proclamations [1610] EWHC KB J22 November 1610''&lt;/ref&gt; and his ''[[Petition of Right]]'', which triggered off the [[English Civil War]] and would have reverberations right across the country for the next 100 years. When the monarchy, in the person of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was [[Restoration (England)|restored]] at the end of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] the idea remained current and royalty continued to use the notion, as a buttress to its authority, until an assertion of the rights of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] brought about the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.&lt;ref&gt;Kantorowicz (1957: 423)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olwig (2002: 102)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century English [[Barrister]] and judge Sir [[William Blackstone]] developed further the medieval idea and the legal argument  (which still stands today) of the monarch in legal terms "immortal" with added emphasis of a quasi divine (''character angelus'') status.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Blackstone|Sir William Blackstone]] (1765) ''Commentaries On The Laws of England: In Four Books'' p.196 Volume 1 "But, fourthly; however the crown may be limited or transferred, it still retains its descendible quality, and becomes hereditary in the wearer of it. And hence in our law the king is said never to die, in his political capacity; though,in common with other men, he is subject to mortality in his natural: because immediately upon the natural death of Henry,William, or Edward, the king survives in his successor.
For the right of the crown vests, eo instanti, upon his heir; either the ''hares natus'', if the course of descent remains unimpeached,or the ''hares factus'', if the inheritance be under any particular settlement. So that there can be no interregnum (7); but,as [[Sir Matthew Hale]] (b) observes, the right of sovereignty is fully invested in the successor by the very descent of the crown.And therefore, however acquired, it becomes in him absolutely hereditary, unless by the rules of the limitation it is otherwise ordered and determined. 
In the same manner as landed estates,to continue our former comparison, are by the law here hereditary, or descendible to the heirs of the owner; but still there exists a power, by which the property of those lands may be transferred to another person. If this transfer be made simply and absolutely (8), the lands will be hereditary in the new owner, and descend to his heir-at-law; but if the transfer be clogged with any limitations, conditions, or entails, the lands must descend in that channel, so limited and prescribed,and no other". 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ancient legal maxim is that ‘the King never dies’. According to Blackstone,”the King survives in his successor” and “the right of the Crown ''vests, eo instanti'', upon his heirs”. Thus in legal theory the monarch is regarded as immortal and there is no moment in which the throne is vacant”. [[Halsbury's Laws of England]] Fifth Edition ''Crown and Crown Proceedings'' pp.8-9 Volume 29 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=John Anthony|title=James I and Divine Right|publisher=Sophia University|location=Tokyo|oclc=41418652|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Revolution monarchs of France also claimed legitimacy on this principle, and extended it to include the idea that the king's heir assimilated the "body politic" of the old king, in a physical "transfer of corporeality", on accession.&lt;ref&gt;de Baecque (1997: 100–102)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''circuit ID''' is a company-specific identifier assigned to a data or voice [[Telecommunications network|network]] connection between two locations.  This connection, often called a circuit, may then be leased to a customer referring to that ID. In this way, the circuit ID is similar to a serial number on any product sold from a retailer to a customer. Each circuit ID is unique,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Newton |first= Harry |date= 2013 |title= Newton's Telecom Dictionary, 27th Updated and Expanded Edition |url= www.NewtonsTelecomDictionary.com |location= New York, NY |publisher= Flatiron |isbn= 978-0-9793873-6-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; so a specific customer having many circuit connections sold to them would have many circuit IDs to refer to those connections. As an example of a use of the circuit ID, when a subscriber/customer has an issue (or trouble) with a circuit, they may contact the Controlling [[Local Exchange Carrier]] (Controlling LEC) telecommunications provider, identifying the circuit that has the issue by giving the LEC that circuit ID reference. The LEC would refer to their internal records for this circuit ID to take corrective action on the designated circuit.

== Telecom circuit ID formats ==
Although telecommunication providers are not required to follow any specific standard for circuit IDs, many do. In the United States, [[Local Exchange Carrier|LEC]]s typically generate circuit IDs based on [[Telcordia Technologies]]' [[Common Language Information Services]]. Using the Telcordia standards for circuit naming allow a LEC the ability to build a certain amount of intelligence into the name of a circuit. The way Telcordia has developed circuit IDs, different types of circuit connections require different formats for the circuit ID. In each format, different segments of the ID have very specific meaning. 

At one time, abbreviations used for circuit types were meaningful (for example, HC for high capacity) but the complexity of the business no longer allows for it. Now, with many different technologies and uses for circuit connections, different types of circuits may use different types of circuit ID formats that provide more meaning for that type of circuit. Below are "examples" of how one telecommunications provider, [[CenturyLink]], has published their choice for circuit IDs for three different types of circuit connections.

=== Carrier-facility format===  
For "carrier circuits", CenturyLink uses a format like: AAAAA/BBBBBB/CCCCCCCCCCC/DDDDDDDDDDD&lt;ref name=CenturyLink&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.centurylink.com/wholesale/systems/WebHelp/reference/circuit_id_formats_guide.htm |title= Guide to Circuit ID Formats |publisher= Centurylink |accessdate=May 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where:
*A = Prefix: 3–5 Alphanumeric characters. This is a unique identifier.  Required.
*B = Facility Type: 1–6 Alphanumeric characters. Describes the "type" of facility circuit. Required.
*C = [[CLLI]] Code for the A-location: 8 or 11 alphanumeric characters.  Required.
*D = [[CLLI]] Code for the Z-location: 8 or 11 alphanumeric characters.  Required.

''Example:''
:'''HN101/T3U/MPLSMNDT000/GLVYMNORIII''' 

The above example circuit ID represents an unframed T3 circuit between two locations in Minnesota with a "serial number" of HN101. Some telecom providers also build a bit of intelligence (or meaning) into this unique prefix information. For instance, a T3U circuit type that carries a specific type of network traffic might use the HN designation at the beginning followed by a number in the 100-block for another specific purpose, 200-block for yet another purpose, and so on.

For more on Carrier Facility formatted circuit IDs using Telcordia's standards, see [[Common_Language_Information_Services#CLFI|Common Language Facility Identification]].

===Serial-number format===
For "special circuits", CenturyLink uses a format like: AA/BBCC/DDDDDD/EEE/FFFF/GGG&lt;ref name=CenturyLink /&gt;

Where:
*A = Prefix: 1–2 alphanumeric characters. Optional. 
*B = Service Code: 2 Characters. Required. The type of service this circuit is providing.
*C = Service Code Modifier: 2 Characters. Required. Modifies the meaning of the service code, often identifies different billing options.
*D = Serial Number: 1–6 digits. Required.
*E = Suffix: 3 character suffix to the serial number. Optional, but rarely used.
*F = Company Code: 2–4 alphabetic characters (eg. NW, MS, PN, CTL, GTEW, NRLD, UDMN, FROT...) Required. Identifies the Controlling LEC.
*G = Segment: 1–3 alphanumeric characters. Optional for point-to-point circuits, but usually found with multi-point DS0 circuits.

''Examples:''
:'''32/HFGS/012345/NW''' = T3 Circuit controlled by [[Qwest]]
:'''73/HCGS/123456/000/CC''' = T1 Circuit controlled by [[Consolidated Communications]]
:'''44/AQDU/987654/000/G3''' = HDSL Circuit controlled by [[G3 Telecom]]

Parts of this circuit ID may also have additional intelligence (or meaning) built in. For instance, the Prefix may or may not be based on the [[Local access and transport area|LATA]] from one end of the circuit or the other.

===Telephone-number format===
For "telephone based data circuits", CenturyLink uses a format like: AA/BBCC/DDD/EEE/FFFF/GGGGG/HHH&lt;ref name=CenturyLink /&gt;

Where:
*A = Prefix: 1-2 alphanumeric characters.  Required if it exists.
*B = Service Code: 2 alphabetic characters. Required for non-DSL numbered circuits.
*C = Service Code Modifier: 2 alphabetic characters. Required. Modifies meaning of the service code, often identifies different billing options.
*D = [[North American Numbering Plan|NPA]]: 3 digits. This is a required field. Numbering plan area code.
*E = NXX: 3 digits. This is a required field. [[Telephone exchange|Central office]] (exchange) code.
*F = Line: 4 digits. This is a required field.
*G = Extension: 1-5 alphanumeric characters. Optional.
*H = Segment: 1–3 alphanumeric characters. This is an rarely used optional field.

''Example:''
:'''54/UDNV/303/111/5555/99/1''' = a circuit serving phone number 303-111-5555, ext. 99, on segment 1

== Circuit designations in the United Kingdom ==

Each carrier ([[Public Telecommunications Operator|Public Telecomms Operator]]) in the UK has its own form of designation.  The Post Office/BT system is described here from the original term ‘Engineering Circuit Designation’.  Other PTOs have their own scheme and would be suitable for inclusion.

The Post Office or BT system historically used PW and R, optionally followed by a Region and/or Area code, followed by a number of digits between 4 and 6 for rented, analogue private lines.  A Region code might have been LR for London Region or ER for Eastern Region, and for an Area L/NW for North West London or CB for Cambridge.  In all but the rarest instances these must have been migrated to AX by the Analogue Upgrade project to digitise as much as possible for FDM Offload, (no) dc path uniformity and remote access in maintenance.

Between 2 locations then:

*AX nnnnnn designates an analogue (2w or 4w) presented link.
*KX nnnnnn designates a digitally presented link up to 64 kbit/s.
*NX nnnnnn designates a digitally presented link from 128 up to 1,024 kbit/s.
*MX nnnnnn designates a digitally presented link from 2 Mbit/s upwards

Each of the prefixes may have an addition making MX/GB, KX/INT for example.

There are many specialist designations covering bearers for other purposes, for example for IP and bearers provided for other PTOs.  One common other use has been IMUK and IMGB for the 2 Mbit/s link from the public exchange to a customer location for the delivery of ISDN30 in the earlier DASS and more recent I.421 format.

The trend has been that the local UK area suffixes are no longer used though legacy lines with these may still be in place.

== International circuit designations for correspondent IPLCs ==

These were known as CCITT, now ITU-T, designations.  In the interests of international recognition, a protocol with recognisable town names has been used.

The format is:
&lt;Earliest alphabetical town or city&gt; – &lt;second alphabetical town or city&gt; &lt;Type&gt; &lt;Serial&gt;

Towns and cities have abbreviations accepted by the 2 corresponding PTOs and the CCITT/ITU-T.

Examples are:

*AMS = Amsterdam
*BS = Bristol
*DSSD = Düsseldorf
*FFTM = Frankfurt-am-Main
*KOB = Copenhagen
*L = London
*MDD = Madrid
*PS = Paris

Original CCITT Leased Circuit Types were:

'''Analogue'''

P = Audio circuit (however transmitted over distance) presented as Audio for voice

FP = Audio circuit (however transmitted over distance) presented as Audio for Fax modem

DP = Audio circuit (however transmitted over distance) presented as Audio for Data modem

XP = Audio circuit (however transmitted over distance) presented as Audio and switched by customer for alternate use by Voice or Data modem

L – PS P4 was the fourth analogue line between Paris and London normally used for voice transmission at that time. 
DSSD-L XP2 was the fourth analogue line between Düsseldorf and London alternately used for voice and data at that time.

'''Digital'''

NP became the Type designator for most correspondent International digital links.

BS – MDD NP12 and KOB – PS NP34 would have been typical uses of the scheme for links between Bristol &amp; Madrid and Copenhagen &amp; Paris.

'''Notes'''

The choice of letters in designating major town and cities could be seen to reflect a short form of the name in the language of the country and also to disambiguate with similarly named locations.   København being the Danish home version of Copenhagen attracted KOB as the abbreviation.  FFTO was the designation for Frankfurt-an-der-Oder, where there was the clear need to disambiguate references from FFTM.

The serial or the numbered occurrence of a link between two PTOs between 2 cities was usually the next free number in the system, but the CCITT allowed for the re-use of old serial numbers after a period of 6 months.  A customer ordering 3 links could be allocated DP23, DP24 and then DP6 between 2 major cities.  (DP6 had been ceased over 6 months earlier).

It can be considered that the serial or last number of the type of correspondent link between two places made the link unique but did lead to problems, for example when a major [[Public Telecommunications Operator|PTO]] in one country was setting up links in correspondent relations with more than one PTO in another country.

The development was away from correspondent [[IPC Media|IPC]] links to a situation where one facilities provider could provide the link over the international part and sometimes as afar as the distant end customer.  This was the result of liberalisation and competition in home and overseas markets.  In some cases the facilities provider would carry the link to their PoP in the distant country and then rent a national or local tail from the PTO in that country.  That would attract a designation particular to that area and not reflect its international connection significance.

'''Circuit total limitation''' ('''CTL''') is one of the present-day standards for [[electrical panel]]s sold in the United States according to the [[National Electrical Code]].  This standard requires an electrical panel to provide a physical mechanism to prevent installing more circuit breakers than it was designed for.  This has generally been implemented by restricting the use of tandem (duplex) breakers to replace standard single pole breakers.

==Code Requirement==
The 1965 edition of the NEC, article 384-15 was the first reference to the circuit total limitation of [[panelboard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = American Electricians' Handbook | work = 15th Edition |author1=Terrell Croft |author2=Wilford I. Summers |author3=Frederic Hartwell | page = 4.52 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=y-vq2G1lHUMC&amp;pg=PT2144&amp;lpg=PT2144&amp;dq=(NFPA+OR+NEC)+408.54&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fJbfDAdBdl&amp;sig=1fgfhsEulN8PH8XkqnqV3z1yI8g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Jb6sSe_lGozKMvny_O0E&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPT2144,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2008}}, the location of this language is at Article 408.54 now titled "Maximum Number of Overcurrent Devices."
Non-CTL panels have not been made by reputable manufacturers since 1965.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;Telephone conversation with Woody Kerns, Sr. Staff Engineer at Square-D (phone: 888-778-2733) Feb. 24, 2009 {same as reference at [[Square_D#QO]]}.&lt;/ref&gt; Phone conversations are not a reliable reference --&gt;

==Non-CTL for replacement only==

Circuitboards and panelboards built prior to 1965 did not have circuit total limiting devices or features built-in.  To support these old panels, non-CTL circuit breakers that bypass the rejection feature are still sold "for replacement use only."&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = UL's ''Guide Information for Electrical Equipment: The White Book 2008'' | page = 90 | url = http://www.ul.com/regulators/2008_WhiteBook.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080913082528/http://www.ul.com/regulators/2008_WhiteBook.pdf | archivedate = 2008-09-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, numerous unsafe situations have resulted where panels were dangerously overloaded because these non-CTL breakers continue to be used.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  With the use of non-CTL breakers, panels can be configured with the total number of circuits in excess of the designed capacity of that panel.

The 2008 code did away with the previous 42 circuit limitation on panelboards.&lt;ref&gt;See "bullet" in 2008 NEC between Articles 408.30 and 408.36, where 2005's Article 408.35 appeared.&lt;/ref&gt; One can now order panelboards with as many as 84 circuit places, and a corresponding ampacity rating.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;http://ecatalog.squared.com/pubs/Electrical%20Distribution/Panelboards/NQ%20Lighting%20and%20Appliance%20Branch-Circuit%20Panelboards/1600HO0802.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Catalogues are not reliable secondary sources --&gt; If a panelboard with a sufficient number of breaker positions is installed in the first place, the need for non-CTL breakers should be eliminated.

[[Image:CSO diagram US EPA.jpg|right|thumb|360px|'''Combined sewer system'''. During dry weather (and small storms), all flows are handled by the [[publicly owned treatment works]] (POTW).  During large storms, the relief structure allows some of the combined [[stormwater]] and [[sewage]] to be discharged untreated to an adjacent water body.]]
A '''combined sewer''' is a [[sewage]] collection system of pipes and tunnels designed to simultaneously collect [[surface runoff]] water in a shared system. This type of [[gravity sewer]] design is no longer used in almost every instance worldwide when constructing new sewer systems. Modern-day sewer designs exclude surface runoff from [[sanitary sewer]]s, but many older cities and towns continue to operate previously constructed combined sewer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. |date=1972 |title=Wastewater Engineering |location=New York |publisher=McGraw–Hill |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combined sewers can cause serious [[water pollution]] problems during '''combined sewer overflow''' ('''CSO''') events when combined sewage and surface runoff flows exceed the capacity of the [[sewage treatment]] plant, or of the maximum flow rate of the system which transmits the combined sources. In instances where exceptionally high surface runoff occurs (such as large rainstorms), the load on individual tributary branches of the sewer system may cause a back-up to a point where raw sewage flows out of input sources such a toilets, causing inhabited buildings to be flooded with a toxic sewage-runoff mixture, incurring massive financial burdens for cleanup and repair. When combined sewer systems experience these higher than normal throughputs, relief systems cause discharges containing human and industrial waste to flow into rivers, streams, or other bodies of water. Such events frequently cause both negative environmental and lifestyle consequences, including beach closures, contaminated shellfish unsafe for consumption, and contamination of drinking water sources, rendering them temporarily unsafe for drinking and requiring boiling before uses such as bathing or washing dishes.&lt;ref name="EPARTC"&gt;{{cite report |date=August 2004 |title=Report to Congress: Impacts and Control of CSOs and SSOs |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/2004-npdes-cso-report-congress |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA-833-R-04-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Recent archaeological discoveries have shown that some of the earliest sewer systems were developed 2500 BC in the ancient city of [[Harappa]]. The primitive sewers were carved in the ground alongside buildings. This discovery reveals the conceptual understanding of waste disposal by the early civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;handyrubbish.co.uk. [https://handyrubbish.co.uk/blog/brief-history-of-sewers-in-the-ancient-world.html "Brief History of Sewers in the Ancient World."]{{Better source|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest sewers were designed to carry street runoff away from inhabited areas and into surface waterways without treatment.  Open sewers, consisting of gutters and urban streambeds, were common worldwide before the 20th century. In the majority of developed countries, large efforts were made during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to cover the formerly open sewers, converting them to closed systems with cast iron, steel, or concrete pipes, masonry, and concrete arches. Most sewage collection systems of the 19th and early to mid 20th century used single-pipe systems that collect both sewage and [[urban runoff]] from streets and roofs. This type of collection system is referred to as a combined sewer system. The rationale for combining the two was that it would be cheaper to build just a single system.&lt;ref name="Burrian"&gt;{{cite report |authors=Burrian, Steven J., et al. |date=1999 |title=The Historical Development of Wet-Weather Flow Management |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/2000E6J7.pdf |publisher=EPA |id=EPA/600/JA-99/275}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} Most cities at that time did not have [[sewage treatment]] plants, so there was no perceived public health advantage in constructing a separate "surface water sewerage" (UK terminology) or "[[storm drain|storm sewer]]" (US terminology) system.&lt;ref name="EPARTC" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 2–3}}

When constructed, combined sewer systems were typically sized to carry three&lt;ref name="EPARTC" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 2–4}} to 160 times the average dry weather sewage flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lawler |first=Joseph C. |authorlink = |title =Design and Construction of Sanitary and Storm Sewers |publisher =[[American Society of Civil Engineers]] and Water Pollution Control Federation |volume = |edition = |date =1969 |location = |page =136 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally infeasible to treat the volume of mixed sewage and surface runoff flowing in a combined sewer during peak runoff events caused by [[snowmelt]] or [[convective precipitation]]. As cities built sewage treatment plants, those plants were typically built to treat only the volume of sewage flowing during dry weather. Relief structures were installed in the collection system to bypass untreated sewage mixed with surface runoff during wet weather, protecting sewage treatment plants from damage caused if peak flows reached the [[headworks]].&lt;ref name=stpd&gt;{{cite book |last=Okun |first=Daniel A. |authorlink = |title =Sewage Treatment Plant Design |publisher =[[American Society of Civil Engineers]] and Water Pollution Control Federation |volume = |edition = |date =1959 |location = |page =6 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combined sewer overflows (CSOs)==
[[File:Anacostia combined sewer outflow 2018.jpg|thumb|Combined sewer outflow into the [[Anacostia River]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
[[Image:Manhole Brighton.jpg|right|thumb|Photo of the interior of a combined sewer in [[Brighton, England]].]]

These relief structures, called '''storm-water regulators''' (in [[American English]] - or '''combined sewer overflows''' in [[British English]]) are constructed in combined sewer systems to divert flows in excess of the peak design flow of the sewage treatment plant.&lt;ref name=stpd/&gt; Combined sewers are built with control sections establishing stage-discharge or pressure differential-discharge relationships which may be either predicted or calibrated to divert flows in excess of sewage treatment plant capacity. A [[hydraulic jump|leaping weir]] may be used as a regulating device allowing typical dry-weather sewage flow rates to fall into an interceptor sewer to the sewage treatment plant, but causing a major portion of higher flow rates to leap over the interceptor into the diversion outfall. Alternatively, an orifice may be sized to accept the sewage treatment plant design capacity and cause excess flow to accumulate above the orifice until it overtops a side-overflow weir to the diversion outfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lawler |first=Joseph C. |authorlink = |title =Design and Construction of Sanitary and Storm Sewers |publisher =[[American Society of Civil Engineers]] and Water Pollution Control Federation |volume = |edition = |date =1969 |location = |pages =112–114 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSO statistics may be confusing because the term may describe either the number of events or the number of relief structure locations at which such events may occur. A CSO event, as the term is used in American English, occurs when mixed sewage and stormwater are bypassed from a combined sewer system control section into a river, stream, lake, or ocean through a designed diversion [[outfall]], but without treatment. Overflow frequency and duration varies both from system to system, and from outfall to outfall, within a single combined sewer system. Some CSO outfalls discharge infrequently, while others activate every time it rains.&lt;ref name="EPARTC" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 2–3, 2–4}}

The storm water component contributes pollutants to CSO; but a major faction of pollution is the [[first foul flush]] of accumulated [[biofilm]] and sanitary solids scoured from the dry weather [[wetted perimeter]] of combined sewers during peak flow [[turbulence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://netlab.cs.ucla.edu/rrr/wiki-internal/files/sediment%20control.pdf |title=Sewer-Sediment Control: Overview of an EPA Wet-Weather Flow Research Program |last1=Fan |first1=Chi-Yuan |last2=Field |first2=Richard |last3=Lai |first3=Fu-hsiung |website=[[University of California Los Angeles]] |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |accessdate=12 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each storm is different in the quantity and type of pollutants it contributes. For example, storms that occur in late summer, when it has not rained for a while, have the most pollutants. Pollutants like oil, grease, [[fecal coliform]] from pet and wildlife waste, and [[pesticide]]s get flushed into the sewer system. In cold weather areas, pollutants from cars, people and animals also accumulate on hard surfaces and grass during the winter and then are flushed into the sewer systems during heavy spring rains.

===Health impacts===
CSO discharges during heavy storms can cause serious water pollution problems. The discharges contain human and industrial waste, and can cause beach closings, restrictions on shellfish consumption and contamination of drinking water sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=August 2004 |title=Report to Congress on Impacts and Control of Combined Sewer Overflows and Sanitary Sewer Overflows; Fact Sheet |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/2004-npdes-cso-report-congress |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 833-R-04-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to sanitary sewer overflows===
CSOs should not be confused with [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s. Sanitary sewer overflows are caused by sewer system obstructions, damage, or flows in excess of sewer capacity (rather than treatment plant capacity.)&lt;ref name="EPARTC"/&gt;{{rp|Ch.4}} Sanitary sewer overflows may occur at any low spot in the sewer system rather than at the CSO relief structures. Absence of a diversion outfall often causes sanitary sewer overflows to flood residential structures and/or flow over traveled road surfaces before reaching natural drainage channels. Sanitary sewer overflows may cause greater health risks and environmental damage than CSOs if they occur during dry weather when there is no precipitation runoff to dilute and flush away sewage pollutants.

===CSOs in the United States===
[[File:CSO map EPA 2008.jpg|thumb|Most of the US combined sewer systems are in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Great Lakes region|Great Lakes]] regions, and the [[Pacific Northwest]].]]
About 860 communities in the US have combined sewer systems, serving about 40&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/combined-sewer-overflow-frequent-questions |title=Combined Sewer Overflow Frequent Questions |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollutants from CSO discharges can include [[bacteria]] and other [[pathogen]]s, [[toxicity|toxic]] chemicals, and debris. These pollutants have also been linked with [[antimicrobial resistance]], posing serious public health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neha.org/node/58616 |title=Using Multiple Antibiotic Resistance Profiles of Coliforms as a Tool to Investigate Combined Sewer Overflow Contamination |author=Dhiman, Gaurav |date=2016 |publisher=Journal of Environmental Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) issued a policy in 1994 requiring municipalities to make improvements to reduce or eliminate CSO-related pollution problems.&lt;ref name="CSO Policy"&gt;EPA (1994-04-19). [https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/owm0111.pdf "Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Control Policy."] ''[[Federal Register]]'', 59 FR 18688.&lt;/ref&gt; It is managed by the [[Clean Water Act#NPDES permits for point sources|National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)]] permit program. The policy defined water quality parameters for the safety of an ecosystem; it allowed for action that are site specific to control CSOs in most practical way for community; it made sure the CSO control is not beyond a community’s budget; and allowed water quality parameters to be flexible, based upon the site specific conditions. The CSO Control Policy required all states to have ″nine minimum controls″ in place by January 1, 1997, to decrease the effects of sewage overflow by making small improvements in existing processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Perciasepe |first=Robert |date=1996-11-18 |title=January 1, 1997, Deadline for Nine Minimum Controls in Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy (Memorandum) |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-cso-policy-memos |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 [[United States Congress|Congress]] amended the [[Clean Water Act]] to require the municipalities to comply with the EPA policy.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Wet Weather Quality Act of 2000, Section 112 of Division B, {{USPL|106|554}}, December 21, 2000. Added section 402(q) to Clean Water Act, {{USC|33|1342(q)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation of CSOs==
The United Kingdom [[Environment Agency]] identified unsatisfactory intermittent discharges and issued an Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive requiring action to limit pollution from combined sewer overflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thompsonrpm.com/screens/pdf/TRPM-TN002.pdf |title=Combined Sewer Overflows |publisher=Thompson Research–Project Management Ltd |location=Stockton-on-Tees, UK |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111132442/http://www.thompsonrpm.com/screens/pdf/TRPM-TN002.pdf |archivedate=2006-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the [[Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment]] adopted a Canada-wide Strategy for the Management of Municipal Wastewater Effluent including national standards to (1)&amp;nbsp;remove floating material from combined sewer overflows, (2)&amp;nbsp;prevent combined sewer overflows during dry weather, and (3)&amp;nbsp;prevent development or redevelopment from increasing frequency of combined sewer overflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2009-02-17 |title=Canada-wide Strategy for the Management of Municipal Wastewater Effluent |url=http://www.usatrenchless.com/wp-content/uploads/cda_wide_strategy_mwwe_final_e.pdf |publisher=Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Municipalities in the US have been undertaking projects to mitigate CSO since the 1990s. For example, prior to 1990, the quantity of untreated combined sewage discharged annually to lakes, rivers and streams in southeast [[Michigan]] was estimated at more than {{convert|30|e9USgal|m3}} per year. In 2005, with nearly $1&amp;nbsp;billion of a planned $2.4&amp;nbsp;billion CSO investment put into operation, untreated discharges have been reduced by more than {{convert|20|e9USgal|m3}} per year. This investment that has yielded an 85 percent reduction in CSO has included numerous sewer separation, CSO storage and treatment facilities and wastewater treatment plant improvements constructed by local and regional governments.&lt;ref name="SEMCOG"&gt;{{cite report |date=September 2008 |title=Investment in Reducing Combined Sewer Overflows Pays Dividends |url=http://semcog.org/desktopmodules/SEMCOG.Publications/GetFile.ashx?filename=InvestmentInReducingCombinedSewerOverflowsPaysDividendsSeptember2008.pdf |publisher=Southeast Michigan Council of Governments |location=Detroit, MI |pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other areas in the US are undertaking similar projects (see, for example, [[Environmental issues in Puget Sound#Combined Sewage Overflow (CSO) in the Puget Sound|in the Puget Sound]] of Washington).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2012 |title=Combined Sewer Overflow Control Program: Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.seattle.gov/mayor/media/PDF/120521PR-SPU-CSO-FAQs.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515150901/http://www.seattle.gov/mayor/media/PDF/120521PR-SPU-CSO-FAQs.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-15 |publisher=Seattle Public Utilities |location=Seattle, WA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities like [[Pittsburgh]], [[Seattle]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City|New York]] are focusing on these projects partly because they are under federal consent decrees to solve their CSO issues. Both up-front penalties and stipulated penalties are utilized by EPA and state agencies to enforce CSO-mitigating initiatives and the efficiency of their schedules. Municipalities' sewage departments, engineering and design firms, and environmental organizations offer different approaches to potential solutions.

===Sewer separation===
Some US cities have undertaken sewer separation projects — building a second piping system for all or part of the community. In many of these projects, cities have been able to separate only portions of their combined systems. High costs or physical limitations may preclude building a completely separate system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=September 1999 |title=Combined Sewer Overflow Management Fact Sheet: Sewer Separation |url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/sepa.pdf |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-832-F-99-041}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 [[Washington, D.C.]] separated its sewers in four small neighborhoods at a cost of $11&amp;nbsp;million. (The project cost also includes improvements to the [[drinking water]] piping system.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2010 |title=DC Water Clean Rivers Project: Rock Creek Sewer Separation |url=http://www.dcwater.com/workzones/projects/pdfs/rock_creek_sewer_seperation_b.pdf |publisher=District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (DCWASA) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827005450/http://www.dcwater.com/workzones/projects/pdfs/rock_creek_sewer_seperation_b.pdf |archive-date=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=July 2011 |title=Long Term Control Plan Consent Decree Status Report: Quarter No. 2 - 2011 |url=http://www.dcwater.com/news/publications/2011Q2_LTCP_CD_Quarterly_Rpt.pdf |publisher=DCWASA |page=10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827004942/http://www.dcwater.com/news/publications/2011Q2_LTCP_CD_Quarterly_Rpt.pdf |archive-date=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CSO storage===
Another solution is to build a CSO storage facility, such as a tunnel that can store flow from many sewer connections. Because a tunnel can share capacity among several outfalls, it can reduce the total volume of storage that must be provided for a specific number of outfalls. Storage tunnels store combined sewage but do not treat it. When the storm is over, the flows are pumped out of the tunnel and sent to a wastewater treatment plant.&lt;ref name="SEMCOG" /&gt;  One of the main concerns with CSO storage is the time it is stored before it is released.  Without careful management of this time the water in the CSO storage facility runs the risk of going septic.{{clarify|date=February 2014}}{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Washington, D.C. is building underground storage capacity as its primary strategy to address CSOs. In 2011 the city began construction on a system of four deep storage tunnels, adjacent to the [[Anacostia River]], that will reduce overflows to the river by 98&amp;nbsp;percent, and 96&amp;nbsp;percent system-wide. The system will comprise over 18 miles of tunnels with a storage capacity of 157 million gallons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dcwater.com/clean-rivers-project |title=Clean Rivers Project |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |publisher=DCWASA |access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The city's overall "Clean Rivers" project, projected to cost $2.6 billion, includes other components, such as [[Combined sewer#Reducing stormwater flows|reducing stormwater flows]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=October 2011 |title=Clean Rivers Project News: Combined Sewer Overflow Control Activities |url=http://www.dcwater.com/news/publications/CSO_Oct_2011_web.pdf |publisher=DCWASA |id=Biannual Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South Boston CSO Storage Tunnel]] is a similar project, completed in 2011.

===Expanding sewage treatment capacity===
Some cities have expanded their basic sewage treatment capacity to handle some or all of the CSO volume. In 2002 litigation forced the city of [[Toledo, Ohio]] to double its treatment capacity and build a storage basin in order to eliminate most overflows. The city also agreed to study ways to reduce stormwater flows into the sewer system. (''See'' [[Combined sewer#Reducing stormwater flows|Reducing stormwater flows]].)&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2002-08-28). [http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/b1ab9f485b098972852562e7004dc686/59f70abeaacc274885256c24005e6240?OpenDocument "United States and Ohio Reach Clean Water Act Settlement with City of Toledo, Ohio."] Press release.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retention basins===
{{main article|Retention basin}}
Retention treatment basins or large concrete [[storage tank|tanks]] that store and treat combined sewage are another solution. These underground structures can range in storage and treatment capacity from {{convert|2|e6USgal|m3}} to {{convert|120|e6USgal|m3}} of combined sewage. While each facility is unique, a typical facility operation is as follows. Flows from the overloaded sewers are pumped into a basin that is divided into compartments. The [[first flush]] compartment captures and stores flows with the highest level of pollutants from the first part of a storm. These pollutants include [[motor oil]], sediment, [[road salt]], and [[lawn]] chemicals (pesticides and [[fertilizer]]s) that are picked up by the stormwater as it runs off roads and lawns. The flows from this compartment are stored and sent to the wastewater treatment plant when there is capacity in the interceptor sewer after the storm. The second compartment is a treatment or flow-through compartment. The flows are [[disinfection|disinfected]] by injecting [[sodium hypochlorite]], or bleach, as they enter this compartment. It then takes about 20‑30&amp;nbsp;minutes for the flows to move to the end of the compartment. During this time, bacteria are killed and large solid materials settle out. At the end of the compartment, any remaining sanitary trash is skimmed off the top and the treated flows are discharged into the river or lake.&lt;ref name="SEMCOG" /&gt;

===Screening and disinfection facilities===
Screening and disinfection facilities treat CSO without ever storing it. Called "flow-through" facilities, they use fine screens to remove solids and sanitary trash from the combined sewage. Flows are injected with sodium hypochlorite for disinfection and mixed as they travel through a series of fine screens to remove debris. The fine screens have openings that range in size from 4 to 6&amp;nbsp;mm, or a little less than a quarter inch. The flow is sent through the facility at a rate that provides enough time for the sodium hypochlorite to kill bacteria. All of the materials removed by the screens are then sent to the sewage treatment plant through the interceptor sewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=September 1999 |title=Combined Sewer Overflow Technology Fact Sheet: Screens |url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/screens.pdf |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 832-F-99-040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reducing stormwater flows===
Communities may implement [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low impact development]] techniques to reduce flows of stormwater into the collection system. This includes:
*constructing new and renovated streets, parking lots and sidewalks with interlocking stones, [[permeable paving]] and [[pervious concrete]]
*installing [[green roof]]s on buildings
*installing [[bioretention]] systems, also called [[rain garden]]s, in landscaped areas
*[[Rainwater harvesting]] equipment collects runoff from building roofs during wet weather for irrigating landscapes and gardens during dry weather
*[[Graywater]] collection and use on site reduces sewage discharges at all times

===Gray vs. green infrastructure===
CSO mitigating initiatives that are solely composed of sewer system reconstruction are referred to as gray infrastructure, while techniques like permeable pavement and rainwater harvesting are referred to as green infrastructure. Conflict often occurs between a municipality's sewage authority and its environmentally active organizations between gray and green infrastructural plans.{{citation needed |reason= What conflicts? Where and when? How were they resolved?|date=April 2013}}

The 2004 EPA ''Report to Congress'' on CSO's provides a review of available technologies to mitigate CSO impacts.&lt;ref name="EPARTC" /&gt;{{rp|Ch. 8}}

==New Approaches==

===Smart Infrastructure===
Recent technological advances in sensing and control have enabled the implementation of Real Time [[Decision Support Systems]] (RT-DSS) for CSO mitigation. Through the use of [[internet of things]] technology and [[cloud computing]], CSO events can now be mitigated by dynamically adjusting setpoints for movable gates, pump stations, and other actuated assets in sewers and storm water management systems. Similar technology, called [[adaptive traffic control]] is used to control the flow of vehicles through traffic lights. RT-DSS systems take advantage of storm temporal and spatial variability as well as varying concentration times due to diverse land uses across the sewershed to coordinate and optimize control assets. By maximizing storage and conveyance RT-DSS are able to minimize overflows using existing infrastructure. Successful implementations of RT-DSS have been carried out throughout the United States &lt;ref&gt;L. Montestruque, M. Lemmon (2015).

As Britain was the first country to industrialize, it was also the first to experience the disastrous consequences of major [[urbanisation]] and was the first to construct a sewerage system as we know it today to mitigate the resultant unsanitary conditions.&lt;ref name="Abe"/&gt; [[Joseph Bazalgette]] designed an extensive underground sewerage system that diverted waste to the [[Thames Estuary]], downstream of the main centre of population. Six main interceptor sewers, totalling almost 135 miles (217&amp;nbsp;km) in length, were constructed. The intercepting sewers, constructed between 1859 and 1865, were fed by 450 miles (720&amp;nbsp;km) of main sewers that, in turn, conveyed the contents of some 13,000 miles (21,000&amp;nbsp;km) of smaller local sewers.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, David C. and Chant, Colin (1999) ''European Cities and Technology'' (London: Routledge).&lt;/ref&gt; With only minor modifications, Bazalgette's engineering achievement remains the basis for sewerage design up into the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0gBwjLTUzEMC|title=100 Greatest Science Inventions of All Time|author=Kendall F.

In France, the Paris cholera epidemic of 1832 sharpened the public awareness of the necessity for some sort of drainage system to deal with sewage and waster water in a better and healthier way since the Seine received up to 100,000 cubic meters of wastewater per day. Between 1865 and 1920 [[Eugène Belgrand|Eugene Belgrand]] led the development of a large scale system for water supply and wastewater management.&lt;ref name="Abe"/&gt; By 1894 laws were passed which made drainage mandatory. The treatment of Paris sewage, though, was left to natural devices as 5,000 hectares of land were used to spread the waste out to be naturally purified.&lt;ref&gt;George Commair, "The Waste Water Network: and underground view of Paris," in Great Rivers History: Proceedings and Invited Papers for the EWRI Congress and History Symposium, May 17–19, 2009, Kansas City, Missouri, ed.

The image of the sewer recurs in European culture as they were often used as hiding places or routes of escape by the scorned or the hunted, including partisans and [[resistance movement|resistance fighters]] in [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. Fighting erupted in the sewers during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. The only survivors from the [[Warsaw Uprising]] and [[Warsaw Ghetto]] made their final escape through city sewers. Some have commented that the [[engraving]]s of imaginary [[prison]]s by [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] were inspired by the [[Cloaca Maxima]], one of the world's earliest sewers.

===Regulations===

====United Kingdom====
There is in the UK a legal difference between a storm sewer and a surface water sewer.  You do not have a right of connection to a storm-water overflow sewer under section 106 of the Water Industry Act.&lt;ref&gt;United Kingdom. Water Industry Act 1991, c. 56.
[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/56/part/IV/chapter/II/crossheading/communication-of-drains-and-private-sewers-with-public-sewers Section 106, "Right to communicate with public sewers."] National Archives, UK. Accessed 2017-06-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

These are normally the pipe line that discharges to a watercourse, downstream of a combined sewer overflow.  It takes the excess flow from a combined sewer. A surface water sewer conveys rainwater; legally you have a right of connection for your rainwater to this public sewer. A public storm water sewer can discharge to a public surface water, but not the other way around, without a legal change in sewer status by the water company.

===In fiction===
The theme of traveling through, hiding, or even residing in combined sewers is a common plot device in media. Famous examples of sewer dwelling are the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]], Stephen King's ''[[It (1990 film)|It]]'', ''[[Les Miserables]]'', ''[[The Third Man]]'', ''[[Ladyhawke (film)|Ladyhawke]],'' ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'', ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1987 TV series)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', and ''[[Jet Set Radio Future]]''. The [[Todd Strasser]] novel ''[[Todd Strasser#Y2K-9: the Dog Who Saved the World|Y2K-9: the Dog Who Saved the World]]'' is centered on a dog thwarting [[terroristic threat]]s to [[cyberterrorism|electronically sabotage]] American sewage treatment plants.

===Sewer alligators===
{{Main article|Sewer alligator}}
A well-known [[urban legend]], the sewer [[alligator]], is that of giant alligators or [[crocodile]]s residing in combined sewers, especially of major metropolitan areas. Two public sculptures in New York depict an alligator dragging a hapless victim into a [[manhole]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4111768 Subway Art: New York's Underground Treasures : NPR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alligators have been known to get into combined storm sewers in the southeastern United States. [[Closed-circuit television]] by a sewer repair company captured an alligator in a combined storm sewer on tape.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzh1lhV_RXE YouTube&amp;nbsp;– Bad sewer pipes across America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21591">'''Computational biology''' involves the development and application of data-analytical and theoretical methods, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques to the study of biological, ecological, behavioral, and social systems.&lt;ref name="nih" /&gt; The field is broadly defined and includes foundations in [[biology]], [[applied mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[biochemistry]], [[chemistry]], [[biophysics]], [[molecular biology]], [[genetics]], [[genomics]], [[computer science]] and [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="brown" /&gt;

Computational biology is different from [[biological computing]], which is a subfield of [[computer science]] and [[computer engineering]] using [[bioengineering]] and [[biology]] to build [[computer]]s, but is similar to [[bioinformatics]], which is an interdisciplinary science using computers to store and process biological data.

==Introduction==
Computational Biology, which includes many aspects of [[bioinformatics]], is the science of using biological data to develop [[algorithms]] or [[Computational modeling|models]] to understand biological systems and relationships. 
Until recently, biologists did not have access to very large amounts of data. This data has now become commonplace, particularly in [[molecular biology]] and [[genomics]]. Researchers were able to develop analytical methods for interpreting biological information, but were unable to share them quickly among colleagues.&lt;ref name="Hogeweg 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogeweg|first=Paulien|title=The Roots of Bioinformatics in Theoretical Biology|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|date=7 March 2011|volume=7|issue=3|series=3|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002021|pages=e1002021|pmid=21483479|pmc=3068925}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Bioinformatics began to develop in the early 1970s. It was considered the science of analyzing informatics processes of various biological systems. At this time, research in [[artificial intelligence]] was using network models of the human brain in order to generate new [[algorithms]]. This use of biological data to develop other fields pushed biological researchers to revisit the idea of using computers to evaluate and compare large data sets. By 1982, information was being shared among researchers through the use of punch cards. The amount of data being shared began to grow exponentially by the end of the 1980s. This required the development of new computational methods in order to quickly analyze and interpret relevant information.&lt;ref name="Hogeweg 2011"/&gt;
      
Since the late 1990s, computational biology has become an important part of developing emerging technologies for the field of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bourne|first=Philip|title=Rise and Demise of Bioinformatics? Promise and Progress|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002487|volume=8|issue=4|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|pages=e1002487|pmid=22570600|pmc=3343106|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The terms computational biology and [[evolutionary computation]] have a similar name, but are not to be confused. Unlike computational biology, evolutionary computation is not concerned with modeling and analyzing biological data. It instead creates algorithms based on the ideas of evolution across species. Sometimes referred to as [[genetic algorithm]]s, the research of this field can be applied to computational biology. While evolutionary computation is not inherently a part of computational biology, Computational evolutionary biology is a subfield of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=James|title=Evolutionary Computation|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|volume=2|issue=6|pages=428–436|date=June 2001|doi=10.1038/35076523|pmid=11389459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computational biology has been used to help sequence the human genome, create accurate models of the human brain, and assist in modeling biological systems.&lt;ref name="Hogeweg 2011"/&gt;

==Subfields==

===Computational anatomy===
{{main|Computational anatomy}}
Computational anatomy is a discipline focusing on the study of anatomical shape and form at the visible or [[Gross anatomy|gross anatomical]] &lt;math&gt; 50-100 \mu &lt;/math&gt; 
scale of [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. It involves the development and application of computational, mathematical and data-analytical methods for modeling and simulation of biological structures. It focuses on the anatomical structures being imaged, rather than the medical imaging devices. Due to the availability of dense 3D measurements via technologies such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), computational anatomy has emerged as a subfield of [[medical imaging]] and [[bioengineering]] for extracting anatomical coordinate systems at the morphome scale in 3D.

The original formulation of computational anatomy is as a generative model of shape and form from exemplars acted upon via transformations.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Computational Anatomy: An Emerging Discipline|url = http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=309082.309089|journal = Q. Appl. Math. |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=617–694 |date = 1998-12-01 |first = Ulf|last = Grenander|first2 = Michael I.|last2 = Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[diffeomorphism]] group is used to study different coordinate systems via [[change of basis|coordinate transformations]] as generated via the [[Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field|Lagrangian and Eulerian velocities of flow]] from one anatomical configuration in &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}^3&lt;/math&gt; to another. It relates with [[shape statistics]] and [[morphometrics]], with the distinction that [[diffeomorphism]]s are used to map coordinate systems, whose study is known as diffeomorphometry.

===Computational biomodeling===
{{main|Modelling biological systems}}
Computational biomodeling is a field concerned with building [[computer model]]s of biological systems. Computational biomodeling aims to develop and use visual simulations in order to assess the complexity of biological systems. This is accomplished through the use of specialized algorithms, and visualization software. These models allow for prediction of how systems will react under different environments. This is useful for determining if a system is robust. A robust biological system is one that “maintain their state and functions against external and internal perturbations”,&lt;ref name="Kitano 2002 206–10"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kitano|first=Hiroaki|title=Computational systems biology|journal=Nature|date=14 November 2002|volume=420|issue=6912|pages=206–10|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/204483859/abstract?accountid=6167|doi=10.1038/nature01254|pmid=12432404}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is essential for a biological system to survive. Computational biomodeling generates a large archive of such data, allowing for analysis from multiple users. While current techniques focus on small biological systems, researchers are working on approaches that will allow for larger networks to be analyzed and modeled. A majority of researchers believe that this will be essential in developing modern medical approaches to creating new drugs and gene therapy.&lt;ref name="Kitano 2002 206–10"/&gt;
A useful modelling approach is to use [[Petri nets]] via tools such as esyN &lt;ref name="Bean 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Favrin|first=Bean|title=esyN: Network Building, Sharing and Publishing.|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2 September 2014|pmid=25181461|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0106035|volume=9|issue=9|pmc=4152123|pages=e106035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational genomics (Computational genetics)===
[[File:Genome viewer screenshot small.png|thumbnail|right|A partially sequenced genome.]]
{{main|Computational genomics}}
Computational genomics is a field within [[genomics]] which studies the [[genome]]s of cells and organisms. It is sometimes referred to as [[Computational and Statistical Genetics]] and encompasses much of [[Bioinformatics]]. The [[Human Genome Project]] is one example of computational genomics. This project looks to sequence the entire human genome into a set of data. Once fully implemented, this could allow for doctors to analyze the genome of an individual patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genome Sequencing to the Rest of Us|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=personal-genome-sequencing|publisher=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This opens the possibility of personalized medicine, prescribing treatments based on an individual’s pre-existing genetic patterns. This project has created many similar programs. Researchers are looking to sequence the genomes of animals, plants, bacteria, and all other types of life.&lt;ref name="Koonin 2001 155–158"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koonin|first=Eugene|title=Computational Genomics|date=6 March 2001|volume=11|issue=5|pages=155–158|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982201000811|doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(01)00081-1|pmid=11267880|journal=Curr. Biol.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main ways that genomes are compared is by [[sequence homology]]. Homology is the study of biological structures and nucleotide sequences in different organisms that come from a common ancestor. Research suggests that between 80 and 90% of genes in newly sequenced prokaryotic genomes can be identified this way.&lt;ref name="Koonin 2001 155–158"/&gt;

This field is still in development. An untouched project in the development of computational genomics is the analysis of intergenic regions. Studies show that roughly 97% of the human genome consists of these regions.&lt;ref name="Koonin 2001 155–158" /&gt; Researchers in computational genomics are working on understanding the functions of non-coding regions of the human genome through the development of computational and statistical methods and via large consortia projects such as [[ENCODE]] (The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) and the Roadmap Epigenomics Project.

===Computational neuroscience===
{{main|Computational neuroscience}}
Computational neuroscience is the study of brain function in terms of the information processing properties of the structures that make up the nervous system. It is a subset of the field of neuroscience, and looks to analyze brain data to create practical applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BU Neuroscience|url=http://www.bu.edu/neuro/graduate/computational-neuroscience/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It looks to model the brain in order to examine specific types aspects of the neurological system. Various types of models of the brain include:
* Realistic Brain Models: These models look to represent every aspect of the brain, including as much detail at the cellular level as possible. Realistic models provide the most information about the brain, but also have the largest margin for error. More variables in a brain model create the possibility for more error to occur. These models do not account for parts of the cellular structure that scientists do not know about. Realistic brain models are the most computationally heavy and the most expensive to implement.&lt;ref name="Sejnowski 1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sejnowski|first=Terrence |author2=Christof Koch |author3=Patricia S. Churchland|title=Computational Neuroscience|date=9 September 1988|volume=241|series=4871}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Simplifying Brain Models:  These models look to limit the scope of a model in order to assess a specific physical property of the neurological system. This allows for the intensive computational problems to be solved, and reduces the amount of potential error from a realistic brain model.&lt;ref name="Sejnowski 1988"/&gt;
It is the work of computational neuroscientists to improve the [[algorithms]] and data structures currently used to increase the speed of such calculations.

===Computational pharmacology===
Computational pharmacology (from a computational biology perspective) is “the study of the effects of genomic data to find links between specific genotypes and diseases and then [[drug discovery|screening drug data]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Price|first=Michael|title=Computational Biologists: The Next Pharma Scientists?|url=http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2012_04_13/caredit.a1200041|date=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pharmaceutical industry]] requires a shift in methods to analyze drug data. Pharmacologists were able to use Microsoft Excel to compare chemical and genomic data related to the effectiveness of drugs. However, the industry has reached what is referred to as the Excel barricade. This arises from the limited number of cells accessible on a spreadsheet. This development led to the need for computational pharmacology. Scientists and researchers develop computational methods to analyze these massive data sets. This allows for an efficient comparison between the notable data points and allows for more accurate drugs to be developed.&lt;ref name="Walter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jessen|first=Walter|title=Pharma's shifting strategy means more jobs for computational biologists|url=http://medcitynews.com/2012/04/pharmas-shifting-strategy-means-more-jobs-for-computational-biologists/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts project that if major medications fail due to patents, that computational biology will be necessary to replace current drugs on the market. Doctoral students in computational biology are being encouraged to pursue careers in industry rather than take Post-Doctoral positions. This is a direct result of major pharmaceutical companies needing more qualified analysts of the large data sets required for producing new drugs.&lt;ref name="Walter"/&gt;

===Computational evolutionary biology===
Computational biology has assisted the field of evolutionary biology in many capacities. This includes:
* Using DNA data to reconstruct the tree of life with [[computational phylogenetics]]
* Fitting [[population genetics]] models (either forward time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Simulation of Genes and Genomes Forward in Time|journal=Current Genomics|author = Antonio Carvajal-Rodríguez|year = 2012|pmc=2851118|volume=11|issue=1|pages=58–61|doi=10.2174/138920210790218007|pmid=20808525}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[coalescent theory|backward time]]) to DNA data to make inferences about [[population growth|demographic]] or [[natural selection|selective]] history
* Building [[population genetics]] models of evolutionary systems from first principles in order to predict what is likely to evolve.

===Cancer computational biology===
Cancer computational biology is a field that aims to determine the future mutations in cancer through an algorithmic approach to analyzing data. Research in this field has led to the use of high-throughput measurement. High throughput measurement allows for the gathering of millions of data points using robotics and other sensing devices. This data is collected from DNA, RNA, and other biological structures. Areas of focus include determining the characteristics of tumors, analyzing molecules that are deterministic in causing cancer, and understanding how the human genome relates to the causation of tumors and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yakhini|first=Zohar|title=Cancer Computational Biology|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|volume=12|pages=120|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/120|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-12-120|pmid=21521513|pmc=3111371|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational neuropsychiatry===
Computational neuropsychiatry is the emerging field that uses mathematical and computer-assisted modeling of brain mechanisms involved in mental disorders. It was already demonstrated by several initiatives that computational modeling is an important contribution to understand neuronal circuits that could generate mental functions and dysfunctions.&lt;ref&gt;Dauvermann, Maria R., Heather C. Whalley, André Schmidt, Graham L. Lee, Liana Romaniuk, Neil Roberts, Eve C. Johnstone, Stephen M. Lawrie, and Thomas WJ Moorhead. "Computational neuropsychiatry–schizophrenia as a cognitive brain network disorder." Frontiers in psychiatry 5 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tretter, Felix, and M. Albus. "“Computational Neuropsychiatry” of Working Memory Disorders in Schizophrenia: The Network Connectivity in Prefrontal Cortex-Data and Models." Pharmacopsychiatry 40, no. S 1 (2007): S2-S16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marin-Sanguino, A., and E. R. Mendoza. "Hybrid modeling in computational neuropsychiatry." Pharmacopsychiatry 41, no. S 01 (2008): S85-S88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software and tools==
Computational Biologists use a wide range of software. These range from command line programs to graphical and web-based programs.

===Open source software===
[[Open source software]] provides a platform to develop computational biological methods. Specifically, open source means that every person and/or entity can access and benefit from software developed in research. [[PLOS]] cites four main reasons for the use of open source software including:
*[[Reproducibility]]: This allows for researchers to use the exact methods used to calculate the relations between biological data.
*Faster Development: developers and researchers do not have to reinvent existing code for minor tasks. Instead they can use pre-existing programs to save time on the development and implementation of larger projects.
* Increased quality: Having input from multiple researchers studying the same topic provides a layer of assurance that errors will not be in the code.
*Long-term availability: Open source programs are not tied to any businesses or patents. This allows for them to be posted to multiple web pages and ensure that they are available in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=PLOS Computational Biology| doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002799 | volume=8| issue=11 |title=The PLOS Computational Biology Software Section|pages=e1002799|year=2012|last1=Prlić|first1=Andreas| last2=Lapp | first2=Hilmar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conferences==
There are several large conferences that are concerned with computational biology. Some notable examples are [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology]] (ISMB), [[European Conference on Computational Biology]] (ECCB) and [[Research in Computational Molecular Biology]] (RECOMB).

==Journals==

There are numerous journals dedicated to computational biology. Some notable examples include [[Journal of Computational Biology]] and [[PLOS Computational Biology]]. The PLOS computational biology journal is a peer-reviewed journal that has many notable research projects in the field of computational biology. They provide reviews on software, tutorials for open source software, and display information on upcoming computational biology conferences. [[PLOS Computational Biology]] is an [[open access journal]]. The publication may be openly used provided the author is cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PLOS Computational Biology|url=http://www.ploscompbiol.org/static/information}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently a new open access journal [http://biopublisher.ca/index.php/cmb Computational Molecular Biology] was launched.

==Related fields==

Computational biology, [[bioinformatics]] and [[mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biology]] are all interdisciplinary approaches to the life sciences that draw from quantitative disciplines such as mathematics and [[information science]]. The [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] describes computational/mathematical biology as the use of computational/mathematical approaches to address theoretical and experimental questions in biology and, by contrast, bioinformatics as the application of information science to understand complex life-sciences data.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;

Specifically, the NIH defines

{{quote|Computational biology: The development and application of data-analytical and theoretical methods, mathematical modeling and computational simulation techniques to the study of biological, behavioral, and social systems.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;}}

{{quote|Bioinformatics: Research, development, or application of computational tools and approaches for expanding the use of biological, medical, behavioral or health data, including those to acquire, store, organize, archive, analyze, or visualize such data.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;}}

While each field is distinct, there may be significant overlap at their interface.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;

'''Computational photography''' refers to digital image capture and processing techniques that use digital computation instead of optical processes. Computational photography can improve the capabilities of a camera, or introduce features that were not possible at all with film based photography, or reduce the cost or size of camera elements. Examples of computational photography include in-camera computation of digital [[panoramas]],&lt;ref&gt;Steve Mann and R. W. Picard. "Virtual bellows: constructing high-quality images from video.", In Proceedings of the IEEE First International Conference on Image ProcessingAustin, Texas, November 13–16, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[high-dynamic-range imaging|high-dynamic-range images]], and [[light field camera]]s. Light field cameras use novel optical elements to capture three dimensional scene information which can then be used to produce 3D images, enhanced [[depth of field|depth-of-field]], and selective de-focusing (or "post focus"). Enhanced depth-of-field reduces the need for mechanical [[focus (optics)|focusing]] systems. All of these features use computational imaging techniques.

The definition of computational photography has evolved to cover a number of
subject areas in [[computer graphics]], [[computer vision]], and applied
[[optics]].  These areas are given below, organized according to a taxonomy
proposed by [[Shree K. Nayar]]{{cn|date=November 2017}}.  Within each area is a list of techniques, and for
each technique one or two representative papers or books are cited.
Deliberately omitted from the
taxonomy are [[image processing]] (see also [[digital image processing]])
techniques applied to traditionally captured
images in order to produce better images.  Examples of such techniques are
[[image scaling]], dynamic range compression (i.e. [[tone mapping]]),
[[color management]], image completion (a.k.a. inpainting or hole filling),
[[image compression]],  [[digital watermarking]], and artistic image effects.
Also omitted are techniques that produce [[3D scanner|range data]],
[[voxel|volume data]], [[3D model]]s, [[light field|4D light fields]],
4D, 6D, or 8D [[Bidirectional reflectance distribution function|BRDF]]s, or other high-dimensional image-based representations. [[Epsilon Photography]] is a sub-field of computational photography.

==Computational illumination==

This is controlling photographic illumination in a structured fashion, then processing the captured images,
to create new images. The applications include image-based relighting, image enhancement, [[image deblurring]], geometry/material recovery and so forth.

High-dynamic-range imaging uses differently exposed pictures of the same scene to extend dynamic range.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wearcam.org/is_t95_myversion.pdf ON BEING `UNDIGITAL' WITH DIGITAL CAMERAS: EXTENDING DYNAMIC RANGE BY COMBINING DIFFERENTLY EXPOSED PICTURES, IS&amp;T's (Society for Imaging Science and Technology's) 48th annual conference, Cambridge, Massachusetts, May 1995, pages 422-428]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other examples include processing and merging differently illuminated images of the same subject matter ("lightspace").

==Computational optics==

This is capture of optically coded images, followed by computational decoding to produce new images.
[[Coded aperture]] imaging was mainly applied in astronomy or X-ray imaging to boost the image quality. Instead of a single pin-hole, a pinhole pattern is applied in imaging, and [[deconvolution]] is performed to recover the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martinello|first1=Manuel|title=Coded Aperture Imaging|url=http://www.manemarty.com/Publications_files/Martinello_PhDThesis_small.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[coded exposure imaging]], the on/off state of the shutter is coded to modify the kernel of [[motion blur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.media.mit.edu/~raskar/deblur/ |title=Coded Exposure Photography: Motion Deblurring using Fluttered Shutter |first1=Ramesh |last1=Raskar |first2=Amit |last2=Agrawal |first3=Jack |last3=Tumblin |year=2006 |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way motion deblurring becomes a [[well-conditioned problem]]. Similarly, in a lens based coded aperture, the aperture can be modified by inserting a [[broadband mask]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.media.mit.edu/~raskar/Mask/ |title=Dappled Photography: Mask Enhanced Cameras for Heterodyned Light Fields and Coded Aperture Refocusing |first1=Ashok |last1=Veeraraghavan |first2=Ramesh |last2=Raskar |first3=Amit |last3=Agrawal |first4=Ankit |last4=Mohan |first5=Jack |last5=Tumblin |year=2007 |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, out of focus deblurring becomes a [[well-conditioned problem]]. The coded aperture can also improve the quality in light field acquisition using Hadamard transform optics.

Coded aperture patterns can also be designed using color filters, in order to apply different codes at different wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martinello|first=Manuel|last2=Wajs|first2=Andrew|last3=Quan|first3=Shuxue|last4=Lee|first4=Hank|last5=Lim|first5=Chien|last6=Woo|first6=Taekun|last7=Lee|first7=Wonho|last8=Kim|first8=Sang-Sik|last9=Lee|first9=David|year=2015|title=Dual Aperture Photography: Image and Depth from a Mobile Camera|url=http://www.manemarty.com/Publications_files/Martinello_ICCP2015_small.pdf|journal=International Conference on Computational Photography|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chakrabarti|first=A.|last2=Zickler|first2=T.|year=2012|title=Depth and deblurring from a spectrally-varying depth-of-field.|url=|journal=IEEE European Conference on Computer Vision|volume=7576|pages=648–666|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows to increase the amount of light that reaches the camera sensor, compared to binary masks.

==Computational imaging==

Computational imaging is a set of imaging techniques that combine data acquisition and data processing to create the image of an object through indirect means to yield '''enhanced resolution''', additional information such as '''optical phase''' or 3D reconstruction. The information is often recorded without using a [[Optical Microscope|conventional optical microscope configuration]] or with limited datasets.

Computational imaging allows to go beyond physical limitations of optical systems, such as [[numerical aperture]]
&lt;ref&gt;Ou et al., [https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.23.003472 "High numerical aperture Fourier ptychography: principle, implementation and characterization"]''Optics Express 23, 3 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;, or even obliterates the need for [[Lens_(optics)|optical elements]]
&lt;ref&gt;Boominathan et al., [https://www.ece.rice.edu/~vb10/documents/2016/Lensless_Imaging_Computaitonal_Renaissance.pdf "Lensless Imaging: A Computational Renaissance"] (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;.

For parts of the [[optical spectrum]] where imaging elements such as objectives are difficult to manufacture or [[image sensors]]  cannot be miniaturized, computational imaging provides useful alternatives, in fields such as [[X-Ray]]&lt;ref&gt;Miyakawa et al., [https://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OE.22.019803 "Coded aperture detector : an image sensor with sub 20-nm pixel resolution"], ''Optics Express'' 22, 16 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Terahertz radiation|THz radiations]].

===Common techniques ===
Among common computational imaging techniques are [[Coded aperture|lensless imaging]], computational speckle imaging&lt;ref&gt;Katz et al., [https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nphoton.2014.189 "Non-invasive single-shot imaging through scattering layers and around corners via speckle correlations"], ''Nature Photonics 8, 784–790 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;, [[ptychography]] and [[Fourier ptychography]].

Computational imaging technique often draws on [[compressive sensing]] or [[phase retrieval]] techniques, where the angular spectrum of the object is being reconstructed. Other techniques are related to the field of computational imaging, such as [[digital holography]], [[computer vision]] and inverse problems such as [[tomography]].

==Computational processing==

This is processing of non-optically-coded images to produce new images.

==Computational sensors==

These are detectors that combine sensing and processing, typically in hardware, like the [[oversampled binary image sensor]]. &lt;!-- More detail would be welcome! --&gt;

==Early work in computer vision==

Although computational photography is a currently popular buzzword in computer graphics, many of its
techniques first appeared in the computer vision literature,
either under other names or within papers aimed at 3D shape analysis.

==Art history==
[[Image:Lightspace-wearcomp-lightcomb.jpg|100px|left|thumb|A 1981 wearable computational photography apparatus.]]
[[Image:Computational-photography-lightvectoring-as-art-form.jpg|200px|thumb|Wearable Computational Photography originated in the 1970s and early 1980s, and has evolved into a more recent art form. This picture was used on the cover of the John Wiley and Sons textbook on the subject.]]

Computational photography, as an art form, has been practiced by capture of differently exposed pictures of the same subject matter, and combining them together.  This was the insipiration for the development of the wearable computer in the 1970s and early 1980s. Computational photography was inspired by the work of [[Charles Wyckoff]], and thus computational photography datasets (e.g. differently exposed pictures of the same subject matter that are taken in order to make a single composite image) are sometimes referred to as Wyckoff Sets, in his honor.

Early work in this area (joint estimation of image projection and exposure value) was undertaken by Mann and Candoccia.

Charles Wyckoff devoted much of his life to creating special kinds of 3-layer photographic films that captured different exposures of the same subject matter. A picture of a nuclear explosion, taken on Wyckoff's film, appeared on the cover of [[Life Magazine]] and showed the dynamic range from dark outer areas to inner core.

In [[observational astronomy]], the '''culmination''' of a [[astronomical object|celestial object]] (the [[Sun]], the [[Moon]], a [[planet]], a [[star]], or a [[deep-sky object]]) or [[constellation]] is either of two moments when it reaches the observer's [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]&lt;ref name="cgc"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Guide to the Constellations |first=Michael E. |last=Bakich |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1995 |page=8 |isbn=0521449219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fof"&gt;{{cite book |entry=Culmination |page=110 |title=The Facts on File Dictionary of Astronomy |first1=John |last1=Daintith |first2=William |last2=Gould |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2009 |isbn=1438109326}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[celestial sphere]], on which it [[diurnal motion|appears to move]] along a circular path over the course of a [[day]], due to [[Earth's rotation]].

As viewed from the [[planetary surface|surface]] of a [[terrestrial planet|terrestrial body]], except its [[geographic pole]]s, a celestial object passes through the meridian twice a day: once at its '''upper culmination''', when it reaches its highest point as viewed from a given location on Earth, and once at its '''lower culmination''', when it reaches its lowest point. The term ''culmination'' is often used to mean upper culmination.&lt;ref name="cgc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fof" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |entry=Meridian |page=993 |title=The National Enyclopaedia |edition=library |volume=8 |location=London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow |first=William |last=Mackenzie |issue=69 |publisher=Ludgate Hill, E.C. |year=1879–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An object's [[altitude (astronomy)|altitude]] (''A'') in degrees at its upper culmination is equal to 90 subtracted by the observer's [[latitude]] (''L'') and added by the object's [[declination]] (''δ''): {{math|''A'' {{=}} 90° − ''L'' + ''δ''}}.

==Cases==
Three cases are dependent on the observer's [[latitude]] (''L'') and the [[declination]] (''δ'') of the [[celestial object]]:
*The object is above the [[horizon]] even at its lower culmination; i.e. if {{math|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''δ'' + ''L'' &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; &gt; 90°}} (i.e. if in [[absolute value]] the declination is more than the colatitude, in the corresponding hemisphere)
*The object is below the horizon even at its upper culmination; i.e. if {{math|&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''δ'' − ''L'' &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; &gt; 90°}} (i.e. if in absolute value the declination is more than the colatitude, in the opposite hemisphere)
*The upper culmination is above and the lower below the horizon, so the body is observed to rise and set daily; in the other cases (i.e. if in absolute value the declination is less than the [[colatitude]])

The third case applies for objects in a part of the full sky equal to the [[cosine]] of the latitude (at the equator it applies for all objects, because the sky turns around the horizontal north-south line; at the poles it applies for none, because the sky turns around the vertical line). The first and second case each apply for half of the remaining sky.

==Period of time==
{{see also|Sidereal time|Equation of time|Perturbation (astronomy)}}

The period between one upper culmination and the next is about 24 hours, while the period between an upper one and a lower one is 12 hours. The [[Earth's orbit|orbital motion]] and [[proper motion]] of Earth [[perturbation (astronomy)|affect the period]] between successive upper culminations. Due to the [[proper motion|proper]] and [[improper motion]]s of the Sun, one [[solar day]] (the interval between like culminations of the Sun) is slightly longer than one [[sidereal day]] (the interval between like culminations of any [[fixed stars|reference star]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} The [[mean]] difference is 1/365.24219, since Earth takes 365.24219 days to complete one orbit around the Sun.

==The Sun==
{{main|Sun transit time|Noon#Solar noon}}
{{further|Solar zenith angle|Sun path}}

From the [[tropics]] and [[middle latitudes]], the [[Sun]] is visible in the sky at its upper culmination (at [[solar noon]]) and invisible (below the horizon) at its lower culmination (at solar [[midnight]]). When viewed from the [[polar regions of Earth|region]] within either [[polar circle]] around the [[winter solstice]] of that hemisphere (the [[December solstice]] in the [[Arctic]] and the [[June solstice]] in the [[Antarctic]]), the Sun is below the [[horizon]] at both of its culminations. 

Supposing that the [[declination]] of the Sun is +20° on a given summer day, the [[complementary angle]] of 70° (from the Sun to the pole) is added to and subtracted from the observer's [[latitude]] to find the solar altitudes at upper and lower culminations, respectively.
*From [[52th parallel north|52° north]], the upper culmination is at 58° above the horizon due south, while the lower is at 18° below the horizon due north. This is calculated as 52° + 70° = 122° (the [[supplementary angle]] being 58°) for the upper, and 52° − 70° = −18° for the lower.
*From [[80th parallel north|80° north]], the upper culmination is at 30° above the horizon due south, while the lower is at 10° above the horizon ([[midnight sun]]) due north.

==Circumpolar stars==
{{main|Circumpolar star}}

From most of the [[Northern Hemisphere]], [[Polaris]] (the North Star) and the other stars of the [[constellation]] [[Ursa Minor]] appear to circle counterclockwise around the north [[celestial pole]] and remain visible at both culminations (as long as the sky is clear and dark enough). Such objects that always remain above the horizon, as viewed from the observer's latitude, are described as [[circumpolar star|circumpolar]].

[[File:Dri logo basic.png|thumb|right|Logo of the Desert Research Institute]]
'''Desert Research Institute''' ('''DRI''') is the nonprofit research campus of the [[Nevada System of Higher Education]] (NSHE), the organization that oversees all publicly supported higher education in the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Nevada]]. At DRI, approximately 500 research faculty and support staff engage in more than $50 million in environmental research each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dri.edu/About/|title=About DRI|publisher=Desert Research Institute|accessdate=December 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; DRI's environmental research programs are divided into three core divisions (Atmospheric Sciences, Earth and Ecosystem Sciences, and Hydrologic Sciences) and two interdisciplinary centers (Center for Arid Lands Environmental Management and the Center for Watersheds and Environmental Sustainability). Established in 1988 and sponsored by [[AT&amp;T]], the institute's [[Nevada Medal]] awards "outstanding achievement in science and engineering".

==Programs==
;Cloud Seeding Program
DRI weather modification research produced the Nevada State Cloud Seeding Program in the 1960s. This initiative, funded by the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation|U.S. Bureau of Reclamation]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], seeks to augment [[Snow|snowfall]] in mountainous regions of Nevada in order to increase [[Snowpack|snow pack]] and water supply. DRI researchers use ground stations and aircraft to release microscopic [[silver iodide]] particles into winter clouds, stimulating the formation of ice crystals which develop to snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synopsis of DRI Cloud Seeding Program|url=http://www.dri.edu/cloudseeding/synopsis|work=DRI Cloud Seeding Program|publisher=Desert Research Institute|accessdate=July 9, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222131732/http://www.dri.edu/cloudseeding/synopsis|archivedate=February 22, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research indicates that cloud seeding leads to precipitation rate increases of 0.1 - 1.5 millimeters per hour.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

;Atmospheric and Dispersion Modeling Program
For over a decade the Atmospheric and Dispersion Modeling Program team has been performing work focused on observations and modeling of [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric dispersion processes]] over complex terrain and coastal areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adim.dri.edu/AboutUs/modexp.html|title=Modeling Expertise|publisher=Desert Research Institute|accessdate=December 13, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202004146/http://adim.dri.edu/AboutUs/modexp.html|archivedate=February 2, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the team is applying, developing, and evaluating [[Mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale meteorological]] models as well as regulatory and advanced [[List of atmospheric dispersion models|atmospheric dispersion models]] such as ISC3ST, [[AERMOD]], WYNDVALLEY, ASPEN and [[CALPUFF]]. They have developed a [[Outline of air pollution dispersion|Lagrangian]] Random Particle Dispersion Model that has been applied to complex coastal and inland environments.

Several recent projects led to developing real time mesoscale forecasting system using the MM5 model coupled with a Lagrangian random particle dispersion model and implementation of [[data assimilation]] schemes.

==History==
;Founder Dr. Wendell Mordy
A two-page bill, signed into law by then Nevada Governor Grant Sawyer on March 23, 1959, authorized establishment of the Desert Research Institute at the University of Nevada, Reno.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-nv-desert-research-institute-032009-2009mar20-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

UNR hired Dr. Wendell Mordy as the Founding Director (1960-1969) of the University's Desert Research Institute, which initially was just an office at the top of the historic [[Morrill_Hall_(University_of_Nevada,_Reno)|Morrill Hall]] building on UNR's campus. Early on Mordy also initiated the development of the [[Fleischmann_Planetarium_%26_Science_Center|UNR's Fleishmann Atmospherium Planetarium]].&lt;ref&gt;First-hand knowledge as the son of Edwin X Berry, who joined DRI in 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drill instructor at the Officer Candidate School.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A Sergeant Instructor (Gunnery Sergeant) of the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] corrects an error by an officer candidate]]
A '''drill instructor''' is a [[non-commissioned officer]] in the [[armed forces]] or [[police forces]] with specific duties that vary by country.  For example, in the [[Military of the United States|United States armed forces]], they are assigned the duty of [[Recruit training|training new recruits]] entering the military.

Drill instructors within the U.S. armed forces have different titles in each branch of service.

The instruction and indoctrination given by the drill instructors of the various U.S. military branches includes instruction in customs and practices of military life, physical fitness, instruction in the proper execution of [[Foot drill|military drill]], instilling discipline and willingness to immediately obey all [[Superior orders|lawful orders]] given by superiors, and oftentimes, basic armed and unarmed combat training.

==Australia==

===Australian Army===
In the [[Australian Army]], the staff responsible for training recruits are known as Recruit Instructors. They teach recruits discipline, fieldcraft, marksmanship, service knowledge and drill.

Each recruit platoon is commanded by Recruit Instructors usually consisting of a [[Lieutenant]], a [[Sergeant]] and up to four instructors of the [[Corporal]] or [[Bombardier (rank)|Bombardier]] rank. A Recruit Instructor can be identified by a [[Army Recruit Training Centre|1st Recruit Training Battalion]] colour patch on his or her [[slouch hat]] and a small Recruit Instructor badge worn on the right breast pocket, if the position has been held long enough.

Members from all [[List of Australian Army Corps|Corps in the Army]] are eligible to become Recruit Instructors, including females. Experience as a Recruit Instructor is often a prerequisite to senior non-commissioned appointments in the military.

===Royal Australian Navy===
In the [[Royal Australian Navy]], there are Instructors at [[HMAS Cerberus (naval base)|HMAS Cerberus]], where the Recruit School course is held, and [[HMAS Creswell]], where the NEOC (New Entry Officer Course) is held, as well as at [[ADFA]].

Each division is made up of one of the following:
* Divisional Officer (a [[Lieutenant]])
* Divisional [[Chief Petty Officer]]
* Divisional [[Petty Officer]]
* Divisional Junior Sailor (a [[Leading Seaman]], who is the class instructor)
* Divisional [[Able Seaman]] (some large divisions may have a few Able Seaman serving as Assistant Instructors)

===Australian Federal Police===
In the [[Australian Federal Police]], Drill Instructors are trained and accredited by the Recognition and Ceremonial team.  Each accredited Drill Instructor wears an AFP pin with the wording "DI" positioned 5mm above their name plate or citations.  Drill Instructors are also issued with a black coloured Hellweg brand leather basket weave [[Sam Browne belt]] and strap.  The AFP is the only police agency to formally train and accredit police drill instructors in Australia, with a number of [[New South Wales Police Force]] members attached to the NSW Police College holding that qualification.

The Australian Federal Police College at Barton has a non-commissioned officer of sergeant rank holding the position of College Sergeant.  The College Sergeant carries a black [[pace stick]] as a badge of office at ceremonial functions and a swagger stick during normal duties.

===New South Wales Police Force===
The [[New South Wales Police Force]] has a Drill Sergeant and a Drill Constable attached to the NSW Police College at Goulburn.   Drill staff are responsible for training recruits in drill.  These personnel wear a blue [[Aiguillette|cord]] to signify being a protocol officer.  The Senior Protocol Officer (formally known as Protocol and Discipline Officer) which carries the rank of Senior Sergeant is responsible for the coordination of the final week of drill, known as Attestation Week and holds the position of Parade Sergeant at all Attestation Parades.  The Senior Protocol officer is responsible for dress, bearing and discipline and also is the guardian of NSWPF history, customs, traditions and symbols at the NSW Police College.  The Senior Protocol Officer carries a black pace stick with silver fittings and wears a black coloured Hellweg Brand Sam Browne belt with strap as a badge of office.

===Western Australia Police===
The Western Australian Police Force has a Drill Sergeant of the rank of sergeant who trains recruits in drill, discipline and other matters. He is also the recruit training manager responsible for overseeing the recruits training, ceremonial graduations, police funerals and other events. He meets regularly with academy executive and is responsible for removing recruits who fail parts of the course.  The sergeant carries a pace stick as a badge of office during parades.

==United Kingdom==

===British Army===
[[File:Drill Sergeant Shouting Orders MOD 45155579.jpg|thumb|right|A Drill Sergeant of the [[Scots Guards]] shouting orders to his troops]]
In the [[British Army]], the appointment of Drill Sergeant (DSgt) is limited to the five [[Foot Guards]] regiments, the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] (HAC), [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre]] [[Catterick Garrison|Catterick]], [[London District]], and the All-Arms Drill Wing (part of the Army School of Ceremonial, Catterick). Drill Sergeants hold the rank of [[Warrant Officer]] Class 2. However, any senior NCO conducting drill can be colloquially referred to as a "drill sergeant".

There are two Drill Sergeants per [[battalion]] (one in the HAC) and they have specific responsibilities for all duties, public or battalion (royal duties, barrack duties etc.). They support the [[Garrison Sergeant Major]] (GSM) or [[Regimental Sergeant Major]] (RSM) in the formation, practice and execution of these duties, typically running the duties roster, supervising rehearsals, and undertaking the guard mounts, both royal and barrack. They also deputise for the RSM in disciplinary matters.

The London District Drill Sergeant supports the GSM in the supervision of [[Trooping the Colour]], the [[State Opening of Parliament]], [[Beating the Retreat]] and any state visits. He also has responsibility under the GSM for the definition of British Army foot and arms drill.

They can be distinguished from other WO2s by their dress. They have the right to wear [[Sam Browne (belt)|Sam Browne belts]] when in No.2 dress and carry swords (never drawn) on ceremonial duties.

They are the third most senior Warrant Officers within a regimental structure, after the RSM and the [[Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant]] (RQMS). The HAC Drill Sergeant is thus the second most senior [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] soldier in the regiment.

==U.S. Armed Forces==
Drill instructors are held responsible for the welfare, behavior, and military education of the recruits assigned to them on a 24-hour basis throughout the period of initial training, of which the most well known is Basic Training or [[recruit training|boot camp]]. Their responsibilities include areas such as [[military discipline]], [[physical fitness]], and weapons training.  The title of Drill Instructor is a billet independent of rank, to be held by Non-Commissioned Officers who successfully complete the intense training program to earn that title.

The rank held by drill instructors varies by branch:
*''Drill Sergeants'' in the [[United States Army]] are Sergeants (E-5), [[Staff Sergeant]] (E-6), [[Sergeant First Class]] (E-7), and rarely First/Master Sergeants (E-8) .
*''Drill Instructors'' in the [[United States Marine Corps]] normally hold the rank of [[Sergeant]] (E-5) through [[Gunnery Sergeant]] (E-7).  A Corporal (E-4) is no longer authorized to attend Drill Instructor School therefore not authorized to hold the billet of a Drill Instructor. Successful completion of Drill Instructor School grants the Marine an additional MOS (Military Occupational Specialty) designation of 0911, Drill Instructor.
*''Recruit Division Commanders'' (formerly ''Company Commanders'') in the [[United States Navy]] are [[Petty Officer Second Class]] (E-5) through [[Master Chief Petty Officer]] (E-9).
*''Military Training Instructors'' in the [[United States Air Force]] are generally Staff Sergeants with 2 years time in grade(E-5) through [[Master Sergeant]]s (E-7).  
*''Company Commanders'' in the [[United States Coast Guard]] are [[Petty Officer Second Class]] (E-5) through [[Master Chief Petty Officer]] (E-9).

The arduous nature of drill instructor duty means that such assignments are among the most prestigious carried out by [[enlisted]] personnel. Those who become drill instructors are eligible for a variety of [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|military awards]], such as the Marine [[Drill Instructor Ribbon]], and the Army's [[Drill Sergeant Identification Badge]].

===U.S. Marine Corps===
[[File:Senior drill instructor.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Marine Senior Drill Instructor supervises the inspection of his platoon]]
{{See also|United States Marine Corps Recruit Training}}

It may be taken offensively by U.S. Marine Corps Drill Instructors to be referred to as 'Drill Sergeants', which is strictly an Army term in the American military, just as Marines may take offense to being called "soldiers". This is considered to be a grievous insult if done intentionally. The only acceptable address of a drill instructor by a recruit is "sir", "ma'am" or "(senior) drill instructor (Rank) (last name)". At [[Officer Candidates School (U.S. Marine Corps)|Officer Candidates School]] (OCS), candidates are instructed by Drill Instructors who have already served a tour at one of the Recruit Depots. Officer candidates address their instructors as "Sergeant Instructor" (and rank and last name), or "Platoon Sergeant" (and rank and last name). The OCS Platoon sergeant is comparable to the Senior Drill Instructor in an enlisted recruit platoon. In the initial phase of training, officer candidates are trained in almost the same manner, and by the same people, as enlisted Marines, with slight differences reflecting the difference between the responsibilities the candidates will have as second lieutenants and those the recruits will have as junior Marines.

In addition, Drill Instructors at either E-6 or E-7 also train naval officer candidates at the Navy's Officer Candidate School at Officer Training Command Newport, Rhode Island, a holdover from the days when they trained prospective naval aviators at the former Aviation Officer Candidate School (AOCS) at Naval Aviation Schools Command, Pensacola, FL. Class Drill Instructors train officer candidates alongside Class Chief Petty Officers who have experience training Navy recruits as Recruit Division Commanders (RDCs). Unlike Marine Corps recruits, Navy officer candidates must address Drill Instructors by their rank, "Staff Sergeant" or "Gunnery Sergeant".

In the U.S. Marine Corps, candidates for Drill Instructor school are both volunteers and designates.  The Headquarters Marine Corps Special Duty Assignment Team creates a list known as the HSST List. This list has the names of Marines that have been slotted for the different B-Billets and Special Duty Assignments. Once a Marine's name comes up on this list, they must either serve the duty or prove that they are unfit for the assignment. The tour of duty is three years and demands the highest moral character and strength.  It is the job of the Drill Instructor to pass these characteristics on to the future of the Corps. This duty is referred to as "Making Marines", and is one of the most important duties of a Marine's career. A drill instructor is directly involved in shaping the future of the United States Marine Corps. Marines report to either Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island in South Carolina or to Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego in California, where they are assigned to Drill Instructor School. Upon graduation, they are assigned to one of the Recruit Training Battalions. Female Marines may now serve on both depots as Drill Instructors. Since spring 2016, Female Drill Instructors have begun serving in limited capacity on board Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego. This change took place in the Spring of 2016. Service as a Drill Instructor is considered a Special Duty Assignment in the Marine Corps (or "B" billet), which is factored into consideration of a Marine's eligibility for promotion. A Marine assigned to DI School must have at least a rank of Sergeant (E-5), or have been selected for promotion to Sergeant.

The school requires DI School students to complete every task recruits are required to do. The typical training day begins around 4:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. (0400 [[military time]]) and ends around 7:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. (1930), many times with specific training evaluations and end-of-day cleanups that require even longer days. At the end of each day, DI School students have to practice effective [[time management]] in studying for exams, practicing drill, rehearsing the teaching of drill movements verbatim and preparing uniforms all while still making time for intense physical training. The school lasts approximately three months with four classes running throughout the year.

Physical training or "PT" as a unit is conducted at least three times a week, with each session lasting approximately two hours. In addition to warming up, stretching, and calisthenics, students complete the "DI Playground" a [[Circuit training|circuit course]] that focuses on enhancing upper body strength. Physical training also prepares the future Drill Instructors for the Marine Corps Physical Fitness Test which consists of pull-ups, abdominal crunches, and a 3-mile timed run. Since a drill instructor is often required to spend 20 hours a day or more on his or her feet and to move fast at all times, various running sessions are conducted to enhance speed and endurance. Students are led by their squad instructors in ability group runs based on speed, gradually increasing distance and speed throughout the course. Track workouts, [[formation (military)|formation]] runs, and [[fartlek]] runs are also a staple of the training. Drill and discipline are crucial parts of the Drill Instructor School curriculum.

Every student is continuously evaluated, corrected, and mentored, with special attention paid to the smallest of details, such as the placement of a finger within 1/4 inch of its required location along a trouser seam, angle of the weapon, and positioning of the student in relation to the unit. Required knowledge is constantly taught and evaluated in the form of written exams, practical applications, and inspections. [[Military uniform|Uniforms]] are inspected continually, with surprise inspections conducted randomly in addition to the scheduled inspections. The drill instructor is expected to convey the best possible Marine Corps image to recruits and to America and to conduct his/herself to the highest Marine Corps leadership and integrity standards as well as to impart these standards to every recruit they train. Drill Instructors take a pledge which consists of the following words: "These recruits are entrusted to my care. I will train them to the best of my ability. I will develop them into smartly disciplined, physically fit, basically trained Marines, thoroughly indoctrinated in love of Corps and country. I will demand of them, and demonstrate by my own example, the highest standards of personal conduct, morality and professional skill."

[[File:Drill sergeant screams.jpg|thumb|upright|A USMC Drill Instructor]]
Upon completion of Drill Instructor School, Drill Instructors are assigned to Recruit Training Battalions as junior members ("fourth hats", "third hats", "kill hats", "bobby", or "bulldogs") of drill instructor teams. His or her job consists of constant corrections, dispensing punitive "Incentive Training" (IT), and keeping unremitting pressure on recruits to pay attention to details. He or she also teaches and reinforces academic knowledge to recruits. It is his or her duty to command the recruit platoon for initial drill evaluation, in which, in addition to the platoon receiving a score, the Drill Instructor is evaluated as well. These new drill instructors bear the burden of responsibility for breaking down a recruit's sense of self and selfishness, so that the more experienced drill instructors can focus the recruits on selflessness, obedience, and fraternity.

After completing a few 13-week cycles, the drill instructor is moved up to the position of ''Experienced Drill Instructor'' (EDI), also called the "heavy", "drill hat" or "J Hat".

The next step in a drill instructor career is becoming a ''Senior Drill Instructor''. Senior Drill Instructors hold a respected position which is distinguished by the wearing of a black sword belt (or Sam Browne Belt, but without the shoulder strap) instead of a green duty belt. A Senior Drill Instructor is ultimately accountable for the training of the [[platoon]] and for the efficiency of his or her assistant Drill Instructors. Although Senior Drill Instructors are NCOs (Sergeants) or Staff NCOs, their position in the recruit training platoon is similar to that of a [[commissioned officer]] Platoon Commander in a line platoon. As such, they are further set apart from "junior" Drill Instructors.

After completing a number of cycles, drill instructors are often assigned to Support Battalion duties outside of recruit-training platoons. Such assignments are referred to as quotas, and include jobs as academic instructors, administrative duties at Recruit Processing (Receiving Barracks, also known as Receiving Company at MCRD San Diego), [[martial arts]] instructors, Medical Rehabilitation Platoon (MRP), Physical Conditioning Platoon (PCP), Combat Water Survival Instructors, Field Training Instructors (a.k.a. Black Shirts) [MCRD Parris Island only], and Instructional Training Company Instructors (ITC DI) [MCRD San Diego only].

Some drill instructors choose to do a second tour of duty on the drill field. These volunteers still report to Drill Instructor School, but are referred to as course challengers, and are only required to complete a short refresher course. Multiple tour drill instructors, based on rank and experience, are usually assigned as Senior Drill Instructors, Series Chief Drill Instructors (MCRD San Diego) or Series Gunnery Sergeants (MCRD Parris Island), DI school instructors, Company First Sergeants, or Battalion Sergeants Major.

While in Drill Instructor status, both male and female DIs wear a [[World War I]] [[campaign hat]] with their service and utility uniforms.

For their successful service, Marine Drill Instructors are awarded the [[Drill Instructor Ribbon]]. This award is also given to other enlisted Marines and officers assigned to the recruit training environment, although these billets are recognized as being less directly involved in actually training recruits such as Series and Company Commander/ XO, Battalion Executive Officer, S-3, and Commander, and various levels of Sergeants Major at each Depot. At OCS, the ribbon is also given to Officer Candidate Company First Sergeants, Company Gunnery Sergeants, and Platoon Commanders.

===United States Army===
[[File:Drillsergeant.jpg|frame|upright=1.5|A Drill Sergeant drills recruits in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].]]
Historically, the task of the Drill Sergeant has been intrinsic to good order and discipline and commands respect throughout the Army.  Currently, soldiers of appropriate rank (usually [[Staff Sergeant]]s and [[Sergeant First Class|Sergeants First Class]] ) may volunteer or be centrally selected by U.S. Army Human Resources Command to attend Drill Sergeant School.  Those centrally selected are known as "DA Selected" meaning [[Department of the Army]] selected.  Drill Sergeant School is ten weeks long and consists of exactly the same activities as basic training; drill and ceremony, basic rifle marksmanship, obstacle/confidence courses, and field training exercises, training management, and leadership. Certain aspects of the [[Basic Leader Course]] are included.  Drill Sergeant candidates are held to the highest standards while going through the school as preparation for their tours of duty. The Drill Sergeant candidates are treated with a great deal of professionalism and not like recruits.  Upon graduation, male Drill Sergeants wear the [[World War I]] [[campaign hat]] (nicknamed the "Brown Round") and female Drill Sergeants wear the olive drab Australian bush cap.&lt;ref&gt;Army Regulation 670-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

An Army Drill Sergeant's normal tour of duty (called being "on the trail") is two years with a possible one-year extension.  Drill Sergeants may be assigned to units that conduct [[Basic Combat Training]] (BCT), reception, or [[OSUT|One-Station Unit Training]] (OSUT).  BCT Drill Sergeants train approximately 11 cycles during their two-year tours.  OSUT Drill Sergeants train recruits for an equivalent of BCT plus an additional number of weeks depending on the [[Military Occupational Specialty]], so their average number of cycles is less than that of a BCT Drill Sergeant. The breaks between cycles are extremely short, creating an incredibly demanding environment for Drill Sergeants.  It is not unusual for a cycle to graduate on a Thursday or Friday with new recruits arriving the following Monday or Tuesday.  Following several years of regular [[noncomissioned officer]]s filling platoon sergeant billets in [[Advanced Individual Training]], the Army announced in early April 2018, that Drill Sergeants will return to AIT training.

Senior Drill Sergeants are the most senior NCO in a given training platoon, and are ultimately responsible for Soldiers within or under their authority. The only NCO more senior to these individuals at the company level is the company's [[First Sergeant]], the senior enlisted leader and advisor to the company commander.

Successful completion of Drill Sergeant duty greatly enhances opportunities for promotion.  Many of the U.S. Army's most senior [[noncommissioned officer]]s are former Drill Sergeants.

The Army has had a difficult time recruiting Drill Sergeant volunteers due to recent changes in doctrine and policy, with a recent study by the Department of Defense noting that fewer than 30% of Drill Sergeant candidates are volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dod.mil/pubs/git/report.html |title=The Report of the Federal Advisory Committee on Gender-Integrated Training and Related Issues |publisher=Dod.mil |date= |accessdate=2016-02-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303205129/http://www.dod.mil/pubs/git/report.html |archive-date=2016-03-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Past Drill Sergeants enjoyed much autonomy and latitude with which to train recruits and were reputed hands-on disciplinarians.  Currently, the Army's Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) has sought to shift this authority away and has moved closer to what is known as "Schofield's Definition of Discipline."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130705211818/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/armys-new-drill-sergeants-teach-rather-yell ]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now a punishable offense to use demeaning or derogatory terms to refer to recruits or trainees, and terms such as "warrior" or "Soldier" are more preferable.  Additionally, it is a serious offense to punish recruits or trainees with "excessive" physical exercise, now known as [[hazing]].  Due to this, and also in part to the second and third order effects of this policy on the operational force, many NCOs feel disenchanted with the prospect of life on the trail and feel that their leadership abilities are better suited elsewhere.

The United States Drill Sergeant Academy is located in Fort Jackson, South Carolina. This is where all Drill Sergeants go to complete their drill sergeant training. The Academy is led by the Commandant and Deputy Commandant of the Drill Sergeant Academy. The instructors, known as Drill Sergeant Leaders (DSL's) are previously trained, and experienced Drill Sergeants. DSL's are selected very carefully by a panel of current senior Drill Sergeant Leaders, along with the leadership from the Academy. DSL's are held to the same high Army standards that new incoming Drill Sergeants are assessed on and must remain at those standards while instructing at the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Drill Sergeant Academy builds better prepared leaders {{!}} Article {{!}} The United States Army|url = http://www.army.mil/article/142601/|website = www.army.mil|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Navy===
[[File:Instructional Training exercises at RTC Great Lakes.jpg|250px|thumb|A Recruit Division Commander conducts "Instructional Training" to correct substandard performance during boot camp]]
In the [[United States Navy]], recruit training is conducted by Recruit Division Commanders (RDCs, formerly Company Commanders or CCs) at Recruit Training Command Great Lakes, located at Naval Station Great Lakes, in North Chicago, IL. RDCs are usually E-6 ([[Petty Officer First Class]]), but may be up to a Master Chief (E-9) and have at least six years time in service and above, who are volunteers that serve a three-year tour at RTC Great Lakes.

After submitting an approved package containing an endorsement from a commanding officer, prospective RDCs attend RDC "C" School located at RTC Great Lakes and are identified by the blue aiguillettes (ropes) they wear on the left shoulder of either their service, dress, or working uniforms. RDC School students typically spend thirteen weeks learning about the duties they will perform as RDCs, including drill and ceremony, classroom instruction, and uniform and compartment maintenance. They undergo routine uniform inspections, where RDC school staff (experienced RDCs) meticulously check for any deficiencies in a student's uniform. In addition, RDC School students spend three days a week undergoing physical training. Because of the intense workout periods, some RDC students find themselves unprepared; however, they must be ready to keep up with the recruits, some of them who are much younger or more athletic than they are. According to RDC "C" School staff, PT is the number one reason why some students drop out of the course.

Towards the end of RDC "C" School, RDC students shadow actual RDCs currently commanding a division. At the end of thirteen weeks, they receive their red ropes and badges which set them apart as RDCs. Following graduation and entering their first divisions, senior RDCs mentor these new junior RDCs, who then go on to gain experience with every new division (commonly referred to as a "push").

In the second year of their three-year tour, RDCs take a break from training divisions and perform other duties on base, including drill evaluations, practical training instruction, teaching classes at RDC "C" School, or Battle Stations 21.

RDC duty is considered a highly prestigious one as it is associated with higher levels of accession into the higher petty officer rates, including Chief Petty Officer. RDC duty also allows Sailors an opportunity to earn the Master Training Specialist designator. At the end of the three-year tour, eligible RDCs receive the Recruit Training Service Ribbon, along with a choice of coast for their next duty stations.

In addition to training recruits at RTC Great Lakes, RDCs at E-7 (Chief Petty Officer) or above who have experience leading recruit divisions train students at Officer Training Command in Newport, Rhode Island, either training prospective naval officers at Officer Candidate School (OCS) as Class Chief Petty Officers, alongside Marine Corps Drill Instructors, or newly commissioned junior officers in the Navy's Staff Corps (i.e. JAG, Medical Corps, Nurse Corps, etc.) at the Officer Development School (ODS).

===U.S. Air Force===
[[File:USAF female Drill Instructor.jpg|thumb|A Military Training Instructor at graduation parade at USAF basic training]]
{{See also|United States Air Force Basic Military Training}}
Air Force MTIs are non-commissioned officers ranging from Staff Sergeant (E-5) through Master Sergeant (E-7). They are trained at the Military Training Instructor School at Lackland AFB in San Antonio, Texas. Course length has changed several times during the last decade, but generally includes a period of assignment to a senior instructor to observe training (called "bird-dogging"). MTIs initially conduct basic training at Lackland Air Force Base as part of the 737th Training Group, but a select few conduct military training at the Officer Training School at Maxwell AFB and at the Air Force Academy during basic cadet training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PAK/is_5_57/ai_n15894847]&lt;/ref&gt;

MTIs are commonly identified by the AF blue campaign hat. Their usual duty uniform is the [[Airman Battle Uniform]] (ABU), with Blues uniforms worn during certain drill practices, and the graduation ceremony. In the case of ABUs, sage green boots are worn per Dress and Appearance regulations.  After completion of their MTI schooling, they are awarded the time-honored campaign hat. Upon receiving their certification as an instructor, they receive the Air Education and Training Command Instructor badge for wear on the right side of the blues uniform. The badge is not authorized for wear on the ABU. The MTI ribbon was awarded for completion of Instructor training until 4 September 2014. After this time, graduates will be awarded the Air Force Special Duty Ribbon, newly created and authorized on 1 Oct 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usmilitary.about.com/library/milinfo/afmedals/blafmti.htm |title=Air Force Decorations - Air Force Basic Military Training Instructor Ribbon |publisher=Usmilitary.about.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MTIs usually begin their tours as "team members" - junior partners of a two-person team. Experienced MTIs becomes "team chiefs" and often work a basic training flight alone when manning shortages occur (especially during summer). MTIs refer to direct recruit training as being "on the street". At the conclusion of a tour, some MTIs are offered the chance to work in essential support training roles in the basic training course.

MTIs who are rated in the top 10% of their ranks are awarded with a blue "rope" replacing the black leather hat strap on the campaign or bush hat. These master military training instructors often evaluate the trainees and MTI ranks during parades and retreat ceremonies. Special trainers of MTIs used to wear a black "rope" and MTIs certified and assigned to train officer candidates wear a bright silver "rope".{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Unlike the Army, the Air Force uses a different specialist to continue military training during advanced individual or technical training.

The aiguillette in various colors is worn by students to indicate leadership roles - green for student flight leaders, yellow for student squadron leaders, and red for squadron student commanders. A white aiguillette is worn by chapel guides, a white and blue rope denotes they are in the Drum and Bugle Corps, and a teal rope is worn by student counselors. At some technical training centers a black aiguillette is worn by members of student honor guards or drill teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usmilitary.about.com/od/airforcejoin/a/techschoolrest.htm |title=Air Force Technical School Training Restrictions |publisher=Usmilitary.about.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Coast Guard===
[[File:249226.jpg|thumb|A Coast Guard Company Commander instructs recruits.]]
In the U.S. Coast Guard, Company Commanders are usually E-5 to E-8 and are special duty volunteers. Candidates attend Company Commander School in [[Cape May]], [[New Jersey]], which is collocated with recruit basic training. Upon completion, candidates then go in front of a board for final approval. Upon becoming a Company Commander (CC), the Coast Guardsman earns the right to wear the Company Commander Badge.

Coast Guard recruit companies average two or three CCs per, with the newer CCs serving as Assistants to the more experienced Lead CC.

During recent years, Coast Guard Company Commanders have gone to the United States Coast Guard Academy in New London, CT to train outgoing third class cadets during a week-long evolution called "100th Week", in which they are once again treated as incoming fourth class cadets by the CCs. The rationale behind this is to remind these cadets of their experiences coming into the Academy, and to reinforce the mantra that they must do the things they will eventually demand of incoming plebes. Later in the week, CCs begin teaching the cadets lessons on leadership. The experience provides third class cadets with invaluable experience they will need in training the new incoming fourth class cadets during Plebe Summer.

===Drill Instructor's Creed===
In many military services, a Drill Instructors' creed has been created to succinctly state the beliefs that a Drill Instructor should follow.

====United States Army====
The Drill Sergeant Creed of the United States Army is:

:"I am a Drill Sergeant.
:I will assist each individual in their efforts to become a highly motivated, well disciplined, physically and mentally fit soldier, capable of defeating any enemy on today’s modern battlefield.
:I will instill pride in all I train. Pride in self, in the Army, and in Country.
:I will insist that each Soldier meets and maintains the Army standards of military bearing and courtesy, consistent with the highest traditions of the U.S. Army.
:I will lead by example, never requiring a Soldier to attempt any task I would not do myself.
:But first, last, and always, I am an American Soldier – Sworn to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, both foreign and domestic.
:I am a Drill Sergeant"&lt;ref&gt;United States Army. From [http://www.jackson.army.mil/DSS/creed.htm Fort Jackson Drill Instructor's School] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624200115/http://www.jackson.army.mil/DSS/creed.htm |date=June 24, 2007 }}, retrieved 19 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States Marine Corps====
The Drill Instructor Creed of the United States Marine Corps is:

:"These recruits are entrusted to my care.
:I will train them to the best of my ability.
:I will develop them into smartly disciplined, physically fit, basically trained Marines - thoroughly indoctrinated in love of the Corps and country.
:I will demand of them – while demonstrating by my own example – the highest standards of personal conduct, morality, and professional skill."&lt;ref&gt;United States Marine Corps.  From [http://www.marines.mil/marinelink/mcn2000.nsf/lookupstoryref/2005719345 DI School students take pledge to make Marines] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930205628/http://www.marines.mil/marinelink/mcn2000.nsf/lookupstoryref/2005719345 |date=September 30, 2007 }}, July 1, 2005.  Retrieved 19 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States Air Force====
The Military Training Instructor Pledge:

:"The Military Training Instructor Hat that I wear
:Is a symbol of Honor, Professionalism, Integrity, Service, and Excellence in All I Do
:My job is one of the most important to the Air Force
:And I will spare no effort to properly prepare men and women for military service
:I am dedicated to the principles of fairness, firmness, and honesty
:I strive for perfection and reject mediocrity
:Both in my own personal behavior and in the performance of those I lead
:I am an Air Force Military Training Instructor
:And, above all I am an American Airman."

'''Ecoflation''' (a portmanteau of [[ecological]] [[inflation]]) is a future scenario in "Rattling Supply Chains," a research report by the [[World Resources Institute]] and [[A.T. Kearney]] released in November 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RATTLING SUPPLY CHAINS The Effect of Environmental Trends on Input Costs for the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods Industry|url=http://pdf.wri.org/rattling_supply_chains.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; characterized by [[natural resources]] becoming scarcer and [[sustainability]] issues become more pressing, with environmental costs increasingly being borne by those responsible. The concept of ecoflation focuses on having environmental externalities of business be the burden of the organization/business responsible, rather than costs being allocated to the public in general. Ecoflation represents more accurate pricing of the true costs associated with business actions&lt;ref&gt;Rattling Supply Chains, World Resources Institute, A.T. Kearney&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical drama]], the '''epitasis''' ({{lang-grc|ἐπίτασις}}) is the main action of a play, in which the trials and tribulations of the main character increase and build toward a climax and dénouement. It is the third and central part when a play is analyzed into five separate parts: prelude, [[protasis]], epitasis, [[catastasis]] and [[Catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]].

In modern [[dramatic theory]], the [[Dramatic structure|dramatic arc]] is often referred to, which uses somewhat different divisions but is substantially the same concept overall.{{fact|date=April 2013}}

While the same analytical approaches used for profiling metabolites apply to exometabolomics, including [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry]] (LC-MS), [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) and [[gas chromatography–mass spectrometry]] (GC–MS), analysis of exometabolites provides specific challenges and is most commonly focused on investigation of the transformations of exogenous metabolite pools by biological systems.&lt;ref name="Silva"/&gt; Typically, these experiments are performed by comparing metabolites at two or more time points, for example, spent vs. uninoculated/control culture media; this approach can differentiate different physiological states of wild-type yeast and between yeast mutants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since, in many cases, the exometabolite ([[extracellular]]) pool is less dynamic than endometabolite ([[intracellular]]) pools (which are often perturbed during sample processing) and [[Chemically defined medium|chemically defined media]] can be used, it reduces some of the experimental challenges of metabolomics.&lt;ref name="Culf"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuperlovic-Culf |first=Miroslava |chapter=Metabolomics in Animal Cell Culture | editor=Al-Rubeai, M. | title=Animal Cell Culture | publisher=Springer International Publishing  | year=2014 | isbn=978-3-319-10320-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xzmgBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA628| page=628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytical technologies==
In principle, any technologies used for metabolomics can be used for exometabolomics. However, [[liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry]] (LC–MS) has been the most widely used.&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; As with typical metabolomic measurements, metabolites are identified based on accurate mass, retention time, and their MS/MS fragmentation patterns, in comparison to authentic standards. Chromatographies typically used are [[Hydrophilic interaction chromatography|hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography]] for the measurement of polar metabolites,&lt;ref name="McNamara"&gt;{{cite journal | last=McNamara | first=L.

Because LC–MS does not give spatial data on metabolite localization, it can be complemented with [[mass spectrometry imaging]] (MSI).&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt;

[[File:FEI1.JPG|thumb|Federal Executive Institute]]
The '''Federal Executive Institute''' ('''FEI''') is an [[executive education|executive and management development]] and training center for governmental leaders located on a {{convert|14|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus near the center of [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], less than a mile from [[University of Virginia]].

FEI offers values-based [[leadership development]] opportunities through an "interagency 
residential learning experience" which emphasizes "personal growth as well as professional growth."&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, T.W. What's So Special? An Introduction. ''The Public Manager'' Vol.28 No.1 Spring 1999. Pg 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Programs are designed specifically for [[public sector]] [[senior management]].

==History==
The Federal Executive Institute was founded in 1968 "to endow the career leadership levels of the Federal government with the capacity and motivation to bring proactive change to a huge enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, Frank et al. The Early Years of the Federal Executive Institute (Bloomington, IN: iUniverse, 2010) 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
In the 1950s, the federal civilian workforce was larger than it had ever been. Millions of workers had been hired to manage the programs of the New Deal in the 1930s, and more still were brought into federal service to manage the American mobilization during World War II. However, the United States had not implemented any kind of education programs to prepare federal executives to manage this expanded workforce. As a result, the Society for Personnel Administration published a proposal for a "federal staff college" in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;   
Early ideas for senior executive education were based on military models, specifically the military staff colleges which were used to prepare officers for assignments in the upper ranks, specifically as admirals and generals. The United States military had a long experience of organizing and training millions of men and it was believed by many that a similar model of continuing education should be applied to civil servants, to prepare them for more senior assignments.&lt;ref&gt;Proposal for a Federal Staff College&lt;/ref&gt;  
The first step towards the creation of such a federal staff college was taken in 1958 when Congress passed the Government Employees Training Act. The act established several precedents that became central to the formation of the Federal Executive Institute. First and foremost, it cleared the way for the establishment of an executive training center funded by its own revenues, rather than by congressional allocations. This allowed FEI freedom of maneuver and sheltered it from political storms. Second, the act gave agency directors the authority to determine how much money they would spend on executive education and where they would send their executives to be trained. This encouraged FEI to remain tied to the senior executives it was founded to serve because they constantly had to market themselves to federal agencies. Finally, the act paved the way for interagency training. Interagency interaction would become one of the hallmarks of FEI, where senior executives from various backgrounds and agencies would live and learn with each other for weeks at a time.
However, it would still be approximately 10 years before FEI was founded. In the meantime, federal executives furthered their education primarily through the Brookings Institution. Additionally, the Civil Service Commission (CSC) founded two Executive Seminar Centers. The first was founded at King's Point, Long Island in 1963 and the second at Berkeley, California in 1966.  Even with these centers, Chairman Macy wanted more to be done. He wanted to create an institute for those civil servants who had reached the pinnacle of their careers, the "supergrades." These people could not be motivated by further promotion and would only attend the institute in order to improve their own work and the work done by their organizations. Therefore, in August 1966&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; the CSC completed a proposal for a center for advanced executive study to be called the Federal Executive Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creating the Federal Executive Institute===
Following President Johnson's speech, John Macy designated James Beck to coordinate the creation of the Federal Executive Institute. Beck visited potential sites for FEI including Colonial Williamsburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia, the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, the Walter P. Chrysler Estate, and Charlottesville, Virginia. The site needed to be near a university which the faculty could partner with, a location where courses could be held and executives housed, and be within driving distance of Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 38-40.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition to a location, the FEI needed a director. Chairman Macy was able to convince Frank Sherwood, who was teaching at the University of Southern California, to come to Charlottesville as the first director of the Federal Executive Institute. Macy chose Sherwood to be the FEI's first director because he wanted someone "with academic credentials who understands something about adult learning and adult education, who had a substance of understanding about problems of the Federal executive gained through academic research and study, someone with academic status and thus able to attract staff and deal with the University of Virginia."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Peggy. "Federal Executive Institute: Special School for the Super Grades." Government Executive, May 1969:58-61.&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted someone who could turn his vision of a university model within the federal government into a reality. Macy and Sherwood worked exceptionally together and the two soon formed a partnership that shaped the foundational years of FEI.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both agreed that FEI should have an Advisory Board. The FEI Advisory Board provided FEI with supporters placed throughout the government who knew about FEI's mission and the unusual way it operated.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; 
When the Civil Service Commission (CSC) began leasing the Thomas Jefferson Inn, the facilities were in a state of disrepair. Though the exterior had been maintained, leaking pipes and other problems created many maintenance projects that had to be completed in a very short period of time. To help accomplish this, most of the hotel staff was kept on and became the initial FEI staff. Along with other workers, they were able to complete the most necessary repairs and prepare the facility for the first class in October 1968.

===The First Session at FEI===
The first session at FEI began on October 13, 1968. Fifty-three executives were in attendance. All were from within the federal government and all but two were supergrades. The session lasted eight weeks, a period intended to take the executives away from the office long enough to allow them to "look seriously at themselves and their careers and to consider what changes they needed to make for the future." The curriculum was heavily based on John Gardener's book Self-Renewal and emphasized the ability to adapt and change over technical knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Nuechterlein]]. "FEI at Twenty: a Personal Retrospect." Bureaucrat. (Washington D.C.: National Capital Area Chapter of the American Society for Public Administration, Spring 1988) 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The emphasis on change and adaptability was a product of the times. The initial FEI faculty had witnessed many changes in American society in the last decade. As a result, they believed that any attempt to prepare executives for the future was too big a gamble, since it was impossible to accurately predict what the future held. Instead, they wanted to prepare America's "civilian generals" for the future by teaching them how to adapt with change and harness it to accomplish their agency's primary mission.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  To ensure that FEI remained innovative, Macy and Sherwood only contracted faculty for short periods, ensuring that fresh personnel and ideas were always being brought to the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 58.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although self-development was an important part of the original FEI curriculum, Macy believed it should be one of several intellectual and learning goals that executives pursued while at FEI.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Macy and Sherwood intentionally created a learning environment that was learner focused. Individuals were allowed to tailor their experience to their needs and chose which courses they would take to supplement the main programs.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, T.B. Rocky Top, Rocky Road, Solid Rock: Thirty Years of Intellectual History at the Federal Executive Institute. Diss. Virginia Tech, 1998. Falls Church, VA: 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major problems Macy identified in federal civil service was that most executives ranked GS-13 or higher had no experience outside their own agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  It bothered John Macy that the majority of federal executives spent most of their career in one department or even in one bureau. He wanted talented people to gain experience outside what they already knew. So he designed FEI to encourage executives from different agencies to get to know each other and what each person's agency did, furthering an understanding of the functions of government across the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  The founders of FEI intentionally created a casual atmosphere to encourage the executives to mingle with each other and learn more about different government agencies. Executives were given nametags with names and agencies, not positions or rank, to encourage a feeling of equality rather than one of hierarchy among the executives.&lt;ref&gt;Nuechterlein, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===FEI within the Civil Service Commission===
When it was founded, FEI was placed outside the mainstream CSC bureaucracy. The FEI Director reported directly to the CSC Chairman, an unusual relationship for such a small institution. Macy created this relationship so that FEI would be as independent as possible while remaining part of the government. He and his successor, Robert Hampton, ensured that this relationship was preserved. However, when Alan Campbell became Chairman of the Commission and the CSC began transitioning into the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), FEI became part of OPM's larger training program, the Center for Leadership Development.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Today the Federal Executive Institute is part of OPM's Center for Leadership Development. FEI operates five programs of leadership development: Leadership for a Democratic Society (LDS), the FEI SES Leading EDGE Portfolio, Custom Executive Programs (CEP), Open Enrollment Courses (OEP), and the Center for Global Leadership (CGL).  Programs, workshops, and courses are designed and administered by a team of federally employed faculty and staff.  In addition, all programs are supported by adjunct faculty representing a wide spectrum of expertise.

===Leadership for a Democratic Society===
{{ad|date=October 2018}}
The four-week "Leadership for a Democratic Society" (LDS) program improves the leadership skills of senior career federal government executives to enhance their individual performance and the performance of government agencies.  The program focuses on four themes: personal leadership, transforming organizations, policy in a Constitutional system, and the global context for executive action.

LDS offers federal executives a residential learning experience.  Traditional sessions last four weeks while applied learning sessions consist of a two week period at FEI, three months back at the executives' home agency, and another two weeks at FEI. This program was designed to solve the issue that many interested executives are unable to take four weeks away from work.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 78.&lt;/ref&gt;  The maximum enrollment is approximately seventy executives per session, but FEI will often see up to 750 executives complete the LDS program per year.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In addition to an intense curriculum based on Constitutional values, LDS offers a personal approach to leadership development.  By incorporating 360-degree assessments, inventories of strengths and areas for improvement, and constant feedback from peers and facilitators, participants are led to a larger picture of self-awareness.  Executives learn in Leadership Development Teams (LDTs) which are smaller discussion and peer consultation groups that include guidance from a professional facilitator.  In addition, interagency networking is encouraged and fostered throughout the program.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Leadership for a Democratic Society program also includes a wellness track.  All participants complete a comprehensive health risk appraisal to include blood lipid profile and fitness assessment and nutritional counseling.  Executives are provided with the opportunity to take fitness classes in the mornings before breakfast and during the midday break as well as during the open hours when the fitness facility is available for individual exercise.  In addition, smaller breakout sessions and seminar focusing on specific health and wellness topics are offered during the program.  FEI offers on-campus gym facilities as well as a [[volleyball court]] and a [[swimming pool]].

===Custom Executive Programs ===
In addition to LDS, elements of FEI focus on [[Consultant|consulting]] and specific organizational needs within federal agencies.  FEI offers open enrollment courses throughout the year in areas such as: collaborating across organizational boundaries, [[emotional competence]], and strategic leadership. FEI also offers custom designed programs which can be constructed to respond to an organization's specific needs.

FEI has worked with such agencies as: [[USAID]], [[NOAA]], [[NAVAIR]], [[FAA]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], [[Internal Revenue Service]] as well as the Army Senior Leader Development Program, the Defense Senior Leadership Development Program (DSLDP) and the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency in the Government.

===Open Enrollment Programs ===
FEI also offers more than two dozen open enrollment programs to federal executives at the GS15 and [[Senior Executive Service]] (SES) level.  These multi-day courses span a wide range of topics relevant to executive leaders including those which focus on individual skill development as well as organizational enhancement.

===Center for Global Leadership ===
FEI is a founding member of the ''Global Leadership Consortium'' with the Graduate School, [[USDA]], and the National Academy of Public Administration to support federal agencies in developing leaders who can excel in the global environment.  A variety of programs are offered that enhance executives ability to think and relate globally in their leadership approach.

==Related programs==
FEI is part of the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]] (OPM) and falls under OPM's ''HR [[Solution]]s'' organization which functions as OPM's services and consulting division for all U.S. Federal agencies. In addition to FEI, HR Solutions has educational facilities in [[Shepherdstown, West Virginia]] (EMDC)
[[Denver, Colorado]] (WMDC).  FEI also provides Briefing Programs for [[Senior Executive Service]] (SES) members and Schedule C (Administration) appointees.

Various versions of the acronym exist, such as '''LAM''', which leaves out galleries, which may be seen as a subset of museums, and may be confused with commercial galleries where art is bought and sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BibSI |url=http://bibsi.cms.si.umich.edu/node/212 |title=On the LAM: Library, Archive, and Museum Collections in the Creation and Maintenance of Knowledge Communities &amp;#124; BibSI |publisher=Bibsi.cms.si.umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305191920/http://bibsi.cms.si.umich.edu/node/212 |archivedate=2014-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lam.alaska.gov/ |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-12-22 |accessdate=2012-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090501071432/http%3A//lam%2Ealaska%2Egov/ |archivedate= May 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=LAM DNA August 4, 2005 by Jim |url=http://hangingtogether.org/?p=15 |title=Blog Archive » LAM DNA |publisher=hangingtogether.org |date=2005-08-04 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLAMR is another variant which includes Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Conference - Australian Society of Archivists|url=https://www.archivists.org.au/learning-publications/2017-conference|website=www.archivists.org.au|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, GLAMs are institutions in the public interest, collecting [[cultural heritage]] materials.

The term LAM has been in use at least since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w_saAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=LAM+libraries+archives+museums&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=E-LAM|title=Information Retrieval &amp; Library Automation|date=1997|publisher=Lomond Systems.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged as these institutions saw their missions overlapping, creating the need for a wider industry sector grouping. This became apparent as they placed their collections online—artworks, books, documents, and artifacts all effectively becoming "information resources."

Proponents of greater collaboration argue that the present convergence is actually a return to traditional unity. These institutions share epistemological links dating from the [[Library of Alexandria|“Museum” of Alexandria]] and continuing through the [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] gathered in early modern Europe. Over time as collections expanded, they became more specialized and their housing was separated according to the form of information and kinds of users. Furthermore, during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries distinct professional societies and educational programs developed for each kind of institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Archives, Libraries, Museums: Coming Back Together?|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/libraries_and_culture/v049/49.1.marcum.html|journal = Information &amp; Culture: A Journal of History|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 2166-3033|pages = 74-89|volume = 49|issue = 1|doi = 10.1353/lac.2014.0001|first = Deanna|last = Marcum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As collecting institutions, GLAMs preserve and make accessible primary sources valuable for researchers.

'''Green logistics''' describes all attempts to measure and minimize the [[environmental impact|ecological impact]] of [[logistics]] activities. This includes all activities of the forward and reverse flows of products, information and services between the point of origin and the point of consumption. It is the aim to create a sustainable company value using a balance of [[Eco-efficiency|economic and environmental efficiency]]. Green logistics has its origin in the mid 1980s and was a concept to characterize logistics systems and approaches that use advanced technology and equipment to minimize environmental damage during operations.&lt;ref&gt;Thiell, M., Zuluaga, J., Montanez, J., van Hoof, B.: Green Logistics – Global Practices and their Implementation in Emerging Markets, p. 2, Colombia 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demand for action ==
[[File:Green Logistics.png|thumb|300px|right|Three main sections of green logistics]]
Organizations have to face changes in the coming years.

In addition to increasing diversity and dynamics, environmental issues become more important. Social, political and economic demands for sustainable development force organizations to reduce the effect on the environment of their [[supply chain]]s and to develop [[sustainable transport]] and supply chain strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenlogisticsconsultants.com/index.html].  Retrieved 27 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are strong interactions between logistics, environment and natural resources. In addition, the approach of logistics is interdisciplinary, [[holistic]] and cross-company&lt;ref&gt;Hoessle, Ulrike: Sustainable Logistics. Best Lessons from the Global Compact (=WWS Series 2). Seattle 2013.  {{ISBN|978-0-9898270-1-0}}, http://www.wwsworldwide.com.&lt;/ref&gt;
Realising environmental objectives can be done in [[synergy]] with other strategic and financial goals. This is the basis of the great potential of this new logistics problem and challenge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damco.com/Service/GreenLogistics.aspx].  Retrieved 27 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological concern ==
The "ecological concern" in logistics determines how far the logistics or the supply chain of a company is faced with the issue of [[environmental protection]] and [[resource conservation]]. Basically, a supply chain is affected of various influencing factors in this context. The main influencing factors are the stakeholders of the organization and the rising [[energy economics|costs of energy]] and commodity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umweltschutz-bw.de/index.php?lvl=8127].  Retrieved 27 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the key stakeholders in this context are:

* The [[State (polity)|state]] with growing international and national regulations
* Customers and [[consumers|consumer]] with increasing awareness and demand for ecofriendly products and (logistics) services
* Employees who want to work in an environmentally and socially responsible company
* [[Society]] with increasing claims for more [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR)
* Companies themselves; dealing with their own motivation

There is also the pressure of lenders, investors, insurers and investors. Indications of this are new forms of investment in the [[capital market]], such as the [[Dow Jones Sustainability Index]], that tracks the stock performance of the world's leading companies in terms of economic, environmental and social criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.djindexes.com/sustainability]. Retrieved 27 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dimension of ecological concern of a company is the product of these complex and varying factors.

== Approaches ==
Logistics has a whole range of measures to protect the environment and resources. Some are new, others long-known. These actions can be assigned to different levels{{spaced ndash}} maturity, range, scope, capital expenditure and resource requirements.

Corresponding to the holistic approach of green logistics, logistics has five starting points to implement measures for environmental protection and resource conservation:

# customer, market and product
# structures and planning
# processes, control and measurement
# technologies and resources
# employees, suppliers and service providers

Examples:&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: Betriebliches Energiemanagement{{spaced ndash}} Eine Einführung, pp. 95&amp;ndash;98, Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* More efficient packing
* Route optimization
* Load optimization
* Formation of corporate networks, which are connected by logistics service
* Optimizing physical logistics processes by providing a sophisticated IT support

The first four levels form a hierarchy and influence each other sequentially. Decisions on one level define the scope for further decisions on the following levels. Decisions at higher levels reduce the freedom for the following levels. Example: The determination of the packing mass of a product on the Level one defines the volume and weight of a product and therefore the maximum number of items per carrier (e.g., container). Thus, the decision made on level one influences the maximum capacity of a container. The effects on the environment,{{spaced ndash}} measured as [[carbon dioxide|carbon-dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) emissions per transported product{{spaced ndash}} therefore, are strongly influenced by the decisions made on level one. Decisions made on levels two and three, such as route optimization, also affect carbon-dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Straube, F., Cetinkaya, B: Umwelt und Logistik, pp. 62&amp;ndash;81 in Straube, F.; Pfohl, H.-Chr.: Trends und Strategien in der Logistik – Globale Netzwerke im Wandel, Deutscher Verkehrs-Verlag, Bremen 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-87154-388-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MOAB grid fins.jpg|thumb|Closeup of [[GBU-43 Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb|MOAB]] grid fins]]
'''Grid fins''' (or '''lattice fins''') are a type of [[flight control surfaces|flight control surface]] used on [[rocket|rockets]] and [[bomb]]s, sometimes in place of more conventional control surfaces, such as planar [[fin]]s. They have been used since the 1970s in various [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[ballistic missile]] designs such as the [[SS-12 Scaleboard|SS-12 ''Scaleboard'']], [[SS-20|SS-20 ''Saber'']], [[OTR-21 Tochka|SS-21 ''Scarab'']], [[SS-23|SS-23 ''Spider'']], and [[SS-25|SS-25 ''Sickle'']], as well as the [[N1 rocket|N-1]] (the intended rocket for the [[Soviet Moonshot|Soviet moon program]]).

In Russia, they are often referred to as ''{{lang|ru-Latn|Belotserkovskiy}}'' grid fins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zaloga |first=Steve |authorlink= |title=The Scud and Other Russian Ballistic Missile Vehicles |year=2000 |publisher=Concord Publications Co |location=New Territories, Hong Kong |isbn=962-361-675-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after Russian computational [[mechanician]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Sergey Belotserkovskiy|ru|3=Белоцерковский, Сергей Михайлович}} (also known as an advisor of [[Yuri Gagarin]]'s aerospace engineering thesis, where grid fins were examined too&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nkj.ru/archive/articles/10523 {{ref-ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;), who developed them in the 1950s.

Grid fins have been used on conventional missiles and bombs such as the [[Vympel R-77]] air-to-air missile; the [[3M-54 Klub]] (SS-N-27 Sizzler) family of [[cruise missile]]s; and the American [[GBU-43 Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb|Massive Ordnance Air Blast]] (MOAB) large-yield conventional bomb. They have also been used on specialized devices such as the [[RQ-7 Shadow#Quick-MEDS|Quick-MEDS]] delivery system and as part of the [[launch escape system]] for the [[Soyuz spacecraft]].

In 2014, [[SpaceX]] tested grid fins on a first-stage [[F9R Dev1|demonstration test vehicle]] of its reusable [[Falcon 9 v1.1|Falcon 9]] rocket,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher= [[SpaceX]] |title= F9R 1000m Fin Flight &amp;#124; Onboard Cam and Wide Shot|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgLBIdVg3EM |via=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=21 June 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on December 21, 2015 they were used during the high-velocity atmospheric portion of the [[atmospheric entry|reentry]]&lt;!-- SpaceX uses multiple systems, of which the grid fins are only one; the grid fins do not work outside the atmosphere, and they are also unneeded during the reentry burn of the first stage engines when the rocket angle of entry is easily controlled by the thrust vector --&gt; to help guide a commercial Falcon 9 first stage back to land for the first successful orbital booster landing in spaceflight history.

==Design characteristics==
Conventional planar control fins are shaped like miniature [[wing]]s. By contrast, grid fins are a lattice of smaller aerodynamic surfaces arranged within a box. Their appearance has sometimes led them to be compared to [[potato masher]]s or [[waffle iron]]s.

Grid fins can be folded, pitched forward (or backwards), against the cylindrical body of a missile more directly and compactly than planar fins, allowing for more compact storage of the weapon; this is of importance where weapons are launched from a tube or for craft which store weapons in internal bays, such as [[stealth aircraft]].  Generally, the grid fins pitch forward/backward away from the body shortly after the missile has cleared the firing craft.

Grid fins have a much shorter [[chord (aircraft)|chord]] (the distance between leading and trailing edge of the surface) than planar fins, as they are effectively a group of short fins mounted parallel to one another.  Their reduced chord reduces the amount of [[torque]] exerted on the steering mechanism by high-speed airflow, allowing for the use of smaller fin [[actuators]], and a smaller tail assembly overall.

Grid fins perform very well at subsonic and supersonic speeds, but poorly at [[transonic]] speeds; the flow causes a [[normal shock]]wave to form within the lattice, causing much of the airflow to pass completely around the fin instead of through it and generating significant [[wave drag]]. At high [[Mach number]]s, grid fins flow fully supersonic and can provide lower [[drag (physics)|drag]] and greater maneuverability than planar fins.

== Application in reusable launch vehicles ==
[[File:Falcon 9 preparing to launch DSCOVR (16822013226).jpg|thumb|upright|Initial design aluminum grid fins on the [[Falcon 9]] [[launch vehicle]], undeployed. February 2015.]]
[[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9#Falcon 9-R|Falcon 9-R]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spaceflight101.net/spacex---f9r-development-updates.html&lt;/ref&gt; — Grid fins are being used for increased precision in control of the landing location for [[reusable launch vehicle]]s.  The grid fin [[new product development|development effort]] is a part of the [[SpaceX reusable launch system development program]] that has been underway since 2012. The first [[hypersonic velocity|hypersonic]]&lt;!-- low-altitude subsonic vehicle with grid fins had been tested in 2014. --&gt; [[flight test]] with grid fins was in February 2015, and grid fins were subsequently used on all reusable Falcon 9 experimental test landings and, eventually, after December 2015, an increasing number of successful first stage landings and recoveries.

Iteration on the design of the Falcon 9 grid fins continued into 2017. SpaceX CEO [[Elon Musk]] announced in early 2017 that a new version of the Falcon 9 grid fins would improve reusability for the company's vehicles. Falcon 9 Block 5/Version 2.5 will introduce new cast and cut &lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/878821062326198272&lt;/ref&gt; [[titanium]] grid fins. Musk had noted the original Falcon 9 grid fins were made from [[aluminum]].  The fins experience temperatures near their maximum survivability limits during [[atmospheric entry|reentry]] and landing, and so the aluminum fins were coated with an ablative thermal protection system. In fact, some aluminum grid fins have actually caught fire during the entry and landing sequence. The new titanium grid fins should introduce greater controllability to the rocket and increase the payload to orbit capability by allowing Falcon 9 to fly at a higher [[angle of attack]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/03/spacex-new-spaceflight-successful-core-reuse/&lt;/ref&gt;
The larger and more robust titanium grid fins are left unpainted and were first tested in June 2017.  They are used on all reusable Block 5 Falcon 9 first stages since late 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/06/spacex-falcon-9-iridium-next-2-launch/ https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/06/spacex-falcon-9-iridium-next-2-launch/]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4682">The '''High-Z Supernova Search Team''' was an international [[physical cosmology|cosmology]] collaboration which used [[Supernova#Type I|Type Ia supernovae]] to chart the expansion of the [[universe]]. The team was formed in 1994 by [[Brian P. Schmidt]], then a post-doctoral research associate at Harvard University, and [[Nicholas B. Suntzeff]], a staff astronomer at the [[Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory]] (CTIO) in Chile. The original team first proposed for the research on September 29, 1994 in a proposal called ''A Pilot Project to Search for Distant Type Ia Supernova'' to the [[CTIO| CTIO Inter-American Observatory]]. The original team as co-listed on the first observing proposal was: [[Nicholas Suntzeff]] (PI); [[Brian Schmidt]] (Co-I); (other Co-Is) R. Chris Smith, [[Robert Schommer]], [[Mark M. Phillips]], [[Mario Hamuy]], Roberto Aviles, Jose Maza, [[Adam Riess]], [[Robert Kirshner]], Jason Spiromilio, and [[Bruno Leibundgut]]. The original project was awarded four nights of telescope time on the CTIO [[Victor M. Blanco Telescope]] on the nights of February&amp;nbsp;25, 1995, and March&amp;nbsp;6,&amp;nbsp;24, and&amp;nbsp;29, 1995. The pilot project led to the discovery of supernova SN1995Y. In 1995, the HZT elected [[Brian P. Schmidt]] of the [[Mount Stromlo Observatory]] which is part of the [[Australian National University]] to manage the team.

The team expanded to roughly 20 astronomers located in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Chile. They used the Victor M. Blanco telescope to discover Type Ia supernovae out to [[redshift]]s of ''z'' = 0.9. The discoveries were verified with spectra taken mostly from the telescopes of the [[Keck Observatory]], and the [[European Southern Observatory]].

In a 1998 study led by [[Adam Riess]], the High-Z Team became the first to publish evidence that the expansion of the Universe is [[accelerating universe|accelerating]] (Riess et al. 1998, AJ, 116, 1009, submitted March 13, 1998, accepted May 1998). The team later spawned Project ESSENCE led by [[Christopher Stubbs]] of Harvard University and the [[Higher-Z Team]] led by [[Adam Riess]] of Johns Hopkins University and Space Telescope Science Institute.

In 2011, Riess and Schmidt, along with [[Saul Perlmutter]] of the [[Supernova Cosmology Project]], were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15165371 |title=Nobel physics prize honours accelerating Universe find |date=2011-10-04 |publisher=[[BBC News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Integral windup''', also known as '''integrator windup'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/cn/AppNotes/cn_00532c.pdf|title=Microchip Application Note AN532: Servo Control of a DC Motor|page=4|publisher=Microchip Technology, Inc.|date=1997|accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''reset windup''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://d721700c-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/occasionalnotes/control-system-math/minimum-jerk/digitalpid/Discrete%20PID%20Controllers.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7crHUl8Nf_AAuTxhxWS02wldQ0v3SwOn70hdI7rRuzSnvnmo0weS6Q9ogt9LrOTaJAQ0FgiYvwKi5lBKnS_jK3VezrKaTxJE_Gj_0aWXX3-Mec2l6QAKrDlrSr17WoLVFh2l4sbhNZJKN-zG6rv9BZU1TUqGCPkeKu80AJngzzfUaMzWXqQpNBvIhNFUOj-Qhv6VhvyG_uwNs9eqib9Ppf5SOMrdT5iJvh8lXk4FbU99-JCK403lGgfIGADWIvwG0oraHypFKJ2HNCV0E3tL1cNFh40zuMhlrKH4rHfh0xYpesuUKbM%3D&amp;attredirects=0|title=Discretised PID Controllers|author=M. Tham|accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the situation in a [[PID feedback controller]] where a large change in setpoint occurs (say a positive change) and the integral terms accumulates a significant error during the rise (windup), thus [[overshoot (signal)|overshooting]] and continuing to increase as this accumulated error is unwound (offset by errors in the other direction). The specific problem is the excess overshooting.

== Solutions ==
This problem can be addressed by
* Initialising the controller integral to a desired value, for instance to the value before the problem
* Increasing the setpoint in a suitable ramp
* Disabling the integral function until the to-be-controlled [[process variable]] (PV) has entered the controllable region
* Preventing the integral term from accumulating above or below pre-determined bounds
* Back-calculating the integral term to constrain the process output within feasible bounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Douglas|title=Integral (Reset) Windup, Jacketing Logic and the Velocity PI Form|url=http://www.controlguru.com/2008/021008.html|accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence ==
Integral windup particularly occurs as a limitation of physical systems, compared with ideal systems, due to the ideal output being physically impossible (process [[Wiktionary:saturation|saturation]]: the output of the process being limited at the top or bottom of its scale, making the error constant). For example, the position of a valve cannot be any more open than fully open and also cannot be closed any more than fully closed. In this case, anti-windup can actually involve the integrator being turned off for periods of time until the response falls back into an acceptable range.

This usually occurs when the controller's output can no longer affect the controlled variable, or if the controller is part of a selection scheme and it is selected right.

Integral windup was more of a problem in [[analog electronics|analog]] controllers. Within modern [[Distributed Control System]]s and [[Programmable Logic Controller]]s, it is much easier to prevent integral windup by either limiting the controller output, or by using external reset feedback, which is a means of feeding back the selected output to the integral circuit of all controllers in the selection scheme so that a [[PID controller|closed loop]] is maintained.

[[File:Model International Certificate for Operators of Pleasure Craft.jpg|thumb|250px|Specimen of an International Certificate for Operators of Pleasure Craft in accordance with Resolution No. 40 of the UN/ECE Working Party on Inland Water Transport.]]

An '''International Certificate of Competence''' ('''ICC''') is a certificate, which may be issued to anyone who has successfully completed certain ''national boating licenses'' or has passed an ''examination'' to prove the necessary competence for [[pleasure craft]] operation.

Persons wishing to be tested in the United Kingdom need to be tested by an approved ICC test centre 

Although only guaranteed to be accepted in countries that have adopted the relevant UN Resolution, the ICC is a useful document to carry and will generally be accepted where proof of competence is required.

In very general terms an ICC is required for the inland waterways of [[Europe]] and for inland and coastal waters of [[Mediterranean Countries|Mediterranean countries]]. For the coastal waters of [[Northern Europe]] the ICC is generally  not required, however to all of these generalisations there are exceptions.

==Description of the ICC==

The ICC is a product of the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] Inland Water Committee (UN ECE IWC) Resolution 40 (hereafter called Resolution 40).&lt;ref name="res40"&gt;{{cite web
|title=International Certificate for Operators of Pleasure Craft - Resolution No. 40, Revision 3
|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/doc/2013/sc3wp3/ECE-TRANS-SC3-147-rev3e.pdf 
|work=ECE/TRANS/SC.3/147/Rev.3
|date=2012-10-12
|publisher=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, Inland Transport Committee, Working Party on Inland Water Transport
|location=New York and Geneva
|accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This states that the ICC may be issued by a government of one state to its nationals and residents who may be on the waters of a foreign state, on condition that both accept the requirements and conditions set out in Resolution 40.

Governments may appoint competent authorities to issue ICC on their behalf. Globally [[International Yacht Training Worldwide]] (IYT) has been delegated such authority by both Ireland and the UK, and the [[Royal Yachting Association]] (RYA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noonsite.com/Members/val/R2011-04-04-1 Some Good News Regarding the International Certificate of Competence]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[British Sub-Aqua Club]] (BSAC) are both authorized by the UK.
    
The ICC provides documentary assurance from one government to another that the holder meets the levels of competence laid down in Resolution 40. However, the acceptance of Resolution 40 is often caveated.

==History of the ICC==

The origins of the ICC arose from navigation on the [[Rhine]] and the [[Danube]] ([[Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine]]) and the need for reassurance that vessel operators were competent to ensure safety of navigation and protection of the environment as they moved from one country to another. As a result, on 29 January 1979, the United Nations Working Party on Inland Water Transport adopted '''Resolution 14''', which recommended the introduction of a European document for an International Certificate (International Card) to provide those assurances.&lt;ref name="res14"&gt;{{cite web
|title=International Certificate (International Card) Concerning the Competence of Pleasure Craft Operators - Resolution No. 14, revised
|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/doc/finaldocs/sc3/TRANS-SC3-131e.pdf
|work=Compendium of resolutions of the Principal Working Party on Inland Water Transport, TRANS/SC.3/131
|date= 29 January 1979
|page=27
|publisher= United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, Inland Transport Committee, Working Party on Inland Water Transport
|accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Resolution was also intended to facilitate 'waterborne tourism'.  Until then operators could well have been expected to produce competency certificates for each country whose waters they were on.

In the mid-nineties, the Working Group on Inland Water Transport considered that Resolution 14 needed updating and strengthening and on 16 October 1998 the Working Party adopted their revisions as Resolution 40; this replaced Resolution 14.

The ''International Certificate for Operators of Pleasure Craft'' created in Resolution 40 is now more commonly referred to as the ''International Certificate of Competence'' or simply ''ICC''. The ICC is only applicable where the visited state has also adopted or recognises the ICC as a valid standard of competency.

==Application of the ICC==

Resolution 40 not only included operators of pleasure craft bound for or on the inland and coastal waters of foreign states but specifically included bareboat charter vessels. Significantly, it also set out the nautical, regulatory and technical competency requirements to be achieved and a minimum age (16 years of age) for the issue of an ICC irrespective of individual national schemes.

It is the professional opinion of the UNECE IWC that the standards set out in Resolution 40 provide a reasonable and appropriate level of competence for day sailing with due regard to the safety of navigation and crew and the protection of the environment. It is strongly recommended that governments recognise this rather than be drawn into discussions on where the ICC may or may not fit into their own national schemes – much the same as acceptance of the [[International Driving Permit|international driving licence]].

As of 2013 only 22 countries have adopted either resolution so far, of which 16 are [[European Union|EU]] [[Member state of the European Union|member states]]. In reality many countries choose to accept the ICC even though they have not adopted the resolution – but of course this is on their terms and can be subject to local variations. [[Spain]], [[Greece]] and [[Portugal]], for example, have not adopted Resolution 40 but are still most likely to ask visitors for an ICC. In reality, the ICC is more widely accepted as proof of the holder’s competence than adoption of Resolution 40 would suggest.&lt;ref name="ryaref"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rya.org.uk/infoadvice/boatingabroad/icc/Pages/icc.aspx | title = About the ICC / The ICC and Proof of Competence Abroad / Boating Abroad / Information &amp; Advice | accessdate = 2010-10-10 | date = 2010-08-03 | publisher = RYA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation of Resolution 40===
The following [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|UNECE]] member states have adopted Resolution 40 and thus officially accept the ICC as a proof of competence in their territories:&lt;ref name="res40" /&gt;

[[Austria]],
[[Belarus]],
[[Belgium]],
[[Bulgaria]],
[[Croatia]],
[[Czech Republic]],
[[Finland]],
[[Germany]],
[[Hungary]],
[[Ireland]],
[[Lithuania]],
[[Luxembourg]],
[[Netherlands]],
[[Norway]],
[[Romania]],
[[Slovakia]],
[[South Africa]] (not a member state),
[[Switzerland]] and
the [[United Kingdom]].

===Implementation of Resolution 14===
The following UNECE member states have adopted the earlier Resolution 14. Also these countries accept the ICC:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.unece.org/trans/main/sc3/sc3res.html
|title=Application of United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Resolutions relating to Inland Navigation
|format=PDF
|at=See item ''Annual report on the acceptance of the resolutions''
|accessdate=2013-11-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[France]],
[[Italy]] and
[[Poland]].

===States that have not adopted Resolution 40===
The following UNECE member states have not accepted the Resolution 40 nor the  Resolution 14:

Greece,
[[Moldova]],
Portugal,
Spain,
[[Russian Federation]],
[[Serbia]],
[[Sweden]],
[[Ukraine]] and
[[United States]].

==Individual states==

===Finland===
Finland has adopted the resolution but does not require the ICC for normal yachts ("sufficient age and skill" is enough) and does not use [[CEVNI]] for its inland waters.

Some official and some quality assured non-official certificates (mainly the coastal master certificates of the navigation association and the scouts) are regarded as fulfilling knowledge requirements of ICC for coastal waters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veneily.fi/sv/sjomanskap/behorighet Trafi: Internationellt behörighetsbrev för förare av fritidsbåt]&lt;/ref&gt; Courses for the CEVNI part are arranged separately by many organisations. The certificate itself is issued by the authorities, usually based on such documents.

The ICC is required for masters of boats chartered manned for international voyages (in addition to a domestic certificate) and for masters of recreational vessels with length more than 24 metres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/sv/laki/ajantasa/2009/20091687 Lag om fartygspersonal och säkerhetsorganisation för fartyg (29.12.2009/1687)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
[[International Yacht Training Worldwide|IYT Worldwide]] is authorized by the [[Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport|Irish Department of Transport]] to issue ICCs to any nationality provided they meet the knowledge and competency standards required. The [[Irish Sailing Association]] is authorized by the [[Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport|Irish Department of Transport]]. Uniquely, IYT Worldwide has been approved by the Irish Government to issue ICC s to any qualified applicants of any nationality on their behalf. 
The ICC enables owners  vessels to use them in those European waters where an ICC is required, and proves to local authorities that the skipper has the required Irish qualifications for skippering the vessel.

===United Kingdom===
[[International Yacht Training Worldwide]] (IYT Worldwide), The [[Royal Yachting Association]] (RYA),  and the [[British Sub-Aqua Club]] (BSAC) are with the authority of the [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] (MCA) approved to issue ICCs to those who meet the mandated requirements and the competency requirements.

ICC's are able to be issued by these Associations to citizens of Nations who are not signatories. In this manner, for example, USA citizens can gain the ICC. In the USA, NauticEd International Sailing Education facilitates the issuance of the ICC through the UK government via the Royal Yachting Association.

UK ICCs are for use on British registered vessels in the waters of foreign states that participate in Resolution 40, without the need to comply with those states’ national certification requirements. An ICC does not enable a British ICC holder to skipper a non-British registered vessel. If a British skipper wants to skipper a non-British registered vessel then he/she must be qualified per the regulations of the country in which the vessel is registered.

The UK ICC was only available to British citizens or bona fide British residents.This has now been extended to cover other Nationals.

'''International Women's Year''' ('''IWY''') was the name given to 1975 by the [[United Nations]]. Since that year March 8 has been celebrated as [[International Women's Day]], and the '''United Nations Decade for Women''', from 1976 to 1985, was also established.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/events/womensday/2010/history.shtml International Women's Day]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="choike1453"/&gt;

==History==
After years of work by the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] (CSW) to adopt a declaration to eliminate discrimination against women, in 1965, CSW began working in earnest to obtain passage of a declaration to secure women's human rights. Collating responses covering education, employment, inheritance, penal reform, and other issues, from government actors, NGO representatives and UN staff, CSW delegates drafted the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women]] (DEDAW), which was passed by the General Assembly on 7 November 1967.{{sfn|Fraser|1999|pp=891-892}} Once support had been garnered for the declaration, the next step was to prepare it to become a [[Treaty|Convention]]. Though there were delays, by 1972, when the [[United States Congress]] passed [[Title IX]], eliminating discrimination in education for any institution receiving federal funding, hope that passage could be secured surged.{{sfn|Fraser|1999|pp=893-894}} In the meantime, members of the [[Women's International Democratic Federation]] (WIDF) had long been pressing for an international women's year and conference to address women's inequality. As WIDF was designated as an observer and not a member of the CSW, they could not propose the event directly, but drafted a proposal. Persuading the [[Romania]]n delegate of CSW to present their proposal, it was seconded by Finland. In turn, CSW approved the proposal and submitted it to the General Assembly, which proclaimed 1975 as International Women's Year in December 1972.{{sfn|Armstrong|2013|p=201}} The date was significant because it would take place on the thirtieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations.{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=123}} But there were problems with the conference. Initially Soviet women rejected the call for a conference and [[filibuster]]ed the negotiations, preferring to host their own conference in [[East Berlin]] that would not be subject to the UN structure.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=5}}{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=441}} As part of the [[Cold War]] politics, the United States then proposed that the conference not be limited to women, but should be gender neutral, because an all-woman conference would not be taken seriously.{{sfn|Teltsch|1974|p=43}} Finally, [[Mexico City]] agreed to host the conference, and CSW set about the tasks to prepare the "machinery" necessary to secure passage of CEDAW.{{sfn|Friedan|1998|p=441}} [[Helvi Sipilä]], was selected as the Assistant Secretary General for Social Development and Humanitarian affairs and placed in charge of organizing events for the year.{{sfn|Fraser|1999|pp=893-894}}

==International==
===Mexico City===
The first [[World Conference on Women, 1975|UN World Conference on Women]] was held in [[Mexico City]] from 19 June to 2 July.&lt;ref name="choike1453"/&gt; The 1975 conference led to the adoption of the [[World Plan of Action]], as well as the [[Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace]].{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=6}} It led to the establishment of monitoring mechanisms such as, [[International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women]] (INSTRAW) and the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM) and set in motion plans for follow-up conferences, the first of which would be held in 1980 in [[Copenhagen]]. It established the period of 1975 to 1985 as the [[United Nations Decade for Women|UN Decade for Women]], to enable progress and failures to be evaluated and resulted in urging that the [[CEDAW|Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)]] be quickly ratified.{{sfn|Pietilä|2007|p=43}}{{sfn|"Background of the Conference"|1976|p=155}} The 1985 third conference in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], not only closed the decade of women, but set a series of member state schedules for removal of legislated gender discrimination in national laws by the year 2000.&lt;ref name=dowie&gt;Allison Dowie, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L5FAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9aQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2937,4035456 Dangers on the Road to Complete Emancipation], ''Glasgow Herald'', 22 October 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arvonne S.

Prominent attendees included [[Elizabeth Anne Reid|Elizabeth Reid]] and [[Margaret Whitlam]] of Australia.&lt;ref name="naa-fs237"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naa.gov.au/fSheets/fs237.html |title=International Women's Year, 1975 |work=[[National Archives of Australia]] |accessdate=15 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610130940/http://www.naa.gov.au/fsheets/fs237.html |archivedate=June 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''International Women's Year Tribune'' was also organised and attended by 4,000 women in 1975.&lt;ref name="choike1453"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.choike.org/nuevo_eng/informes/1453.html | title = 1st World Conference on Women, Mexico 1975 | work = Choike, [[Third World Institute]] |  accessdate =15 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Berlin===
The World Congress of Women was held in East Berlin as a part of IWY soon after the Mexico City event. It idealized women’s equality as the "true embodiment of the socialist conception of human rights".{{sfn|Eckel|Moyn|2013|pp=68-69}} The Working Group on Equal Rights, composed of experts on government and law from the [[East German Academy of Sciences]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]] and [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist United Party Central Committee]] rejected the notion that women's rights should fall under a separate area designated by gender, but instead should be governed by the United Nations Human Right's position.{{sfn|Eckel|Moyn|2013|p=79}} [[Angela Davis]] was one of the key guests at the conference, as was [[Hortensia Bussi de Allende]], former [[First Lady of Chile]].{{sfn|Eckel|Moyn|2013|p=81}} The state-sponsored program advocated women's solidarity in the national struggles to free women from oppression based on class, race and gender through state socialism.{{sfn|Eckel|Moyn|2013|pp=83-85}}

===Brussels===
The [[International Tribunal on the Crimes Against Women]] was planned as an event for IWY but was not held until 4 to 8 March 1976 in [[Brussels]], Belgium. Limited by funding strictures, the conference hosted 2000 women from forty countries. Speakers addressed economic exploitation and violence against women in its many forms. The most significant development to come out of the conference was the [[International Feminist Network]].{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=214}}

==Zionism controversy==
The 1975 conference was also notable for passing the first "Zionism is racism" resolution passed at any UN-sponsored forum, thus preparing the way for [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379]] in 1975 the following November.&lt;ref&gt;Text of resolution 3379:

:''TAKING NOTE of the Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace 1975, proclaimed by the World Conference of the International Women's Year, held at Mexico City from 19 June to 2 July 1975, which promulgated the principle that "international co-operation and peace require the achievement of national liberation and independence, the elimination of colonialism and neo-colonialism, foreign occupation, Zionism, apartheid and racial discrimina as the recognition of the dignity of peoples and their right to self-determination".''; {{cite web |url=http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/761C1063530766A7052566A2005B74D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121206052903/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/761C1063530766A7052566A2005B74D1 |archivedate=2012-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jwa.org/exhibits/jsp/general.jsp?&amp;imgfile=exhibits%2Fimages%2Fexhban7.gif&amp;media_id=abamexic&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement equating Zionism with racism was also included in an annex to a report to be considered at the final conference of the United Nations Decade for Women in 1985 in Nairobi, Kenya.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;Sam Roberts, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/us/bernice-tannenbaum-who-fought-un-resolution-on-zionism-dies-at-101.html?_r=0 "Bernice Tannenbaum, Who Fought U.N. Resolution on Zionism, Dies at 101"], 9 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as stated in ''It Takes a Dream: The Story of Hadassah'' (1997), by Marlin Levin, "[[Bernice Tannenbaum|Bernice]] asked [President Ronald] Reagan to publicly repudiate the U.N. resolution. He agreed and promised that the U.S. delegation would walk out of Nairobi if the Zionism-equals-racism resolution was included in the final conference declaration."&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; Tannenbaum also convinced the United States Senate to condemn the conference resolution and demand its withdrawal.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; She also personally flew to Kenya with a draft of the Senate resolution, where [[Maureen Reagan]], President Reagan's daughter and the head of the American delegation, repeated the president’s promise to withdraw from the conference if the resolution was included in the final conference delegation.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; Kenya then brokered a compromise in which Zionism was omitted from the final conference report.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

==National==
===Australia===
A conference on 'Women and Politics' was held in September,&lt;ref name="naa-fs237"/&gt; attended by 700 women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/occa_lect/transcripts/290906/index.htm | author = [[Marian Sawer]] | title = Red, White and Blue, What Do They Mean to You? The Significance of Political Colours |date= 29 September 2006 | accessdate =15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The events of IWY in Canada as a whole raised awareness with Canadian women as well as the general public on a wide range of women’s issues and accomplishments. It spurred creation of the Ontario Women and the Law Association and the Service, Office and Retail Workers Union of Canada (SORWUC) and offered funding for many to participate in educational and artistic endeavors aimed at presenting women’s perspectives. One such effort was a petition to the [[National Film Board of Canada]] which led to the creation of Studio D. The [[University of Guelph]] hosted a conference in September dedicated to [[Nellie McClung]] and the reform issues which had been important to her.{{sfn|Pierson|Cohen|1993|p=362}}

===New Zealand===
In June a United Women's Convention was held in [[Wellington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.democrit.net/IWY/Forum1975.htm |title=Forum 1975 |accessdate=15 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928170942/http://www.democrit.net/IWY/Forum1975.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States of America===
Events in support of IWY were held throughout the United States by private organizations and NGOs, such as those held in [[Connecticut]], 11–12 June 1977 and the ''[[Greater Cleveland]] Congress'', October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.lib.uconn.edu/online/research/speclib/ASC/findaids/IWY/MSS19860003.html | title = International Women's Year Conference Records | work = Thomas J. Dodd Research Center, [[University of Connecticut]] | accessdate =15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=IWYGCC | title = INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S YEAR, GREATER CLEVELAND CONGRESS | work = [[Case Western Reserve University]] | accessdate =15 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most significant US events, because it was funded by the US government, was held in [[Houston, Texas]] and though planned as an IWY event, did not take place until 1977. The [[1977 National Women's Conference]] included women from each state in the United States and developed a National Plan of Action, mirroring many of the points of the World Plan of Action.{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=215}}

== Outcomes ==
{{Main|United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3520|Declaration of Mexico on the Equality of Women and Their Contribution to Development and Peace}}
As a result of the international focus on Women in 1975, a number of institutions were established:
* [[International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women]] (INSTRAW)
* [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM)
* [[Women's Studies Resource Centre]] was established in [[South Australia]] during July.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=677 | title = Women's Movement page 6 | work = ''[[South Australia|SM]] Memory'', [[State Library of South Australia]] | accessdate =15 July  2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emblem==
The IWY also launched the "dove" emblem used by the IWY, CEDAW, and UNIFIL.  A stylized dove intersected by a female symbol and an equal sign, the emblem was donated by then 27-year-old New York City advertising company graphic designer Valerie Pettis. It remains the official symbol of [[UN Women]]&lt;ref&gt;[tools.unifem.org/unifem_logos/UNIFEM-GraphicStandards.pdf Graphic Standards]. UNIFEM Headquarters, United Nations Secretariat document, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and is used in [[International Women's Day]] celebrations to this day.&lt;ref name=dowie /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L5FAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9aQMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2937,4035456&amp;dq=valerie+pettis&amp;hl=en Dangers on the road to complete emancipation].

The {{nihongo|'''Japan-Netherlands Institute'''|日蘭学会}} is a [[research institute]] founded in 1975 to carry out research on historical [[Rangaku|Dutch-Japanese relations]] and to foster and promote modern academic and cultural exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jni.or.jp/intro_e.html About us], Japan-Netherlands Institute&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, they received the [[Japan Foundation|Japan Foundation's]] special prize for contributions to cultural exchange and mutual understanding between Japan and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpf.go.jp/e/about/award/index.html Awards and Special Prizes], index of past recipients, The Japan Foundation&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
;Intercultural-academic exchange
In 1986, the Japan-Netherlands Institute began a program to enable Dutch students and researchers to carry out an integral part of their research in Japan.&lt;ref name="Exchange"&gt;[http://www.jni.or.jp/exchange_e.html Academic Cooperation and Exchange], Japanese-Netherland Institute, 28 Feb. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1994 the [[Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science]] began supporting the institute eventually leading to its Japan Prizewinners Program(JPP) from 1995-2008 wherein Dutch students were selected to study Modern Japan for a year before being sent to Japan to study and carry out their research plans.&lt;ref name="Exchange"/&gt; 210 students ultimately passed through the JPP before its conclusion in 2008.&lt;ref name="Exchange"/&gt; Study abroad programs are still supported by the institute however.&lt;ref name="Exchange"/&gt;

In addition to their exchange programs, the Japan-Netherlands Institute holds symposiums on a wide range of topics, organizes lectures at their site or at Japanese universities by prominent Dutch scientists, publishes notices of the findings of young Japanese and Dutch scholars, and offers aide and assistance to Japanese and Dutch scholars within either country.&lt;ref name="Exchange"/&gt;

;Research
Research on Dutch-Japanese studies is both supported and carried out by the institute, and forms the basis for a majority of their publications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jni.or.jp/history_e.html Research], Japanese-Netherland Institute, 28 Feb. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[natural language processing]], '''latent Dirichlet allocation''' ('''LDA''') is a [[generative model|generative statistical model]] that allows sets of observations to be explained by [[Latent variable|unobserved]] groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar. For example, if observations are words collected into documents, it posits that each document is a mixture of a small number of topics and that each word's presence is attributable to one of the document's topics. LDA is an example of a [[topic model|topic model.]]

== History ==

== Topics ==
In LDA, each document may be viewed as a [[mixture model|mixture]] of various topics where each document is considered to have a set of topics that are assigned to it via LDA. This is identical to [[PLSA|probabilistic latent semantic analysis]] (pLSA), except that in LDA the topic distribution is assumed to have a sparse [[Dirichlet distribution|Dirichlet]] [[Prior probability|prior]]. The sparse Dirichlet priors encode the intuition that documents cover only a small set of topics and that topics use only a small set of words frequently. In practice, this results in a better disambiguation of words and a more precise assignment of documents to topics. LDA is a generalization of the [[pLSA]] model, which is equivalent to LDA under a uniform Dirichlet prior distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

For example, an LDA model might have topics that can be classified as '''CAT_related''' and '''DOG_related'''. A topic has probabilities of generating various words, such as ''milk'', ''meow'', and ''kitten'', which can be classified and interpreted by the viewer as "CAT_related". Naturally, the word ''cat'' itself will have high probability given this topic. The '''DOG_related''' topic likewise has probabilities of generating each word: ''puppy'', ''bark'', and ''bone'' might have high probability. Words without special relevance, such as ''"the"'' (see [[function word]]), will have roughly even probability between classes (or can be placed into a separate category). A topic is neither [[semantics|semantically]] nor [[epistemology|epistemologically]] strongly defined. It is identified on the basis of automatic detection of the likelihood of term co-occurrence. A lexical word may occur in several topics with a different probability, however, with a different typical set of neighboring words in each topic.

Each document is assumed to be characterized by a particular set of topics. This is similar to the standard [[bag of words model]] assumption, and makes the individual words [[De Finetti's theorem|exchangeable]].

== Model ==
[[Image:Latent Dirichlet allocation.svg|right|thumb|250px|[[Plate notation]] representing the LDA model.]]  With [[plate notation]], which is often used to represent [[Probabilistic graphical model|probabilistic graphical models]] (PGMs), the dependencies among the many variables can be captured concisely. The boxes are "plates" representing replicates, which are repeated entities. The outer plate represents documents, while the inner plate represents the repeated word positions in a given document, each of which position is associated with a choice of topic and word. M denotes the number of documents, N the number of words in a document. The variable names are defined as follows:

: ''α'' is the parameter of the Dirichlet prior on the per-document topic distributions,
: ''β'' is the parameter of the Dirichlet prior on the per-topic word distribution,
: &lt;math&gt;\theta_m&lt;/math&gt; is the topic distribution for document ''m'',
: &lt;math&gt;\varphi_k&lt;/math&gt; is the word distribution for topic ''k'',
: &lt;math&gt;z_{mn}&lt;/math&gt; is the topic for the ''n''-th word in document ''m'', and
: &lt;math&gt;w_{mn}&lt;/math&gt; is the specific word.[[File:Smoothed_LDA.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Smoothed_LDA.png|thumb|251x251px|Plate notation for LDA with Dirichlet-distributed topic-word distributions]]

The fact that W is grayed out means that words &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are the only [[observable variable]]s, and the other variables are [[latent variable]]s.
As proposed in the original paper&lt;ref name="blei2003" /&gt;, a sparse Dirichlet prior can be used to model the topic-word distribution, following the intuition that the probability distribution over words in a topic is skewed, so that only a small set of words have high probability. The resulting model is the most widely applied variant of LDA today. The plate notation for this model is shown on the right, where &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of topics and &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1, \dots, \varphi_K&lt;/math&gt; ''are'' &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional vectors storing the parameters of the Dirichlet-distributed topic-word distributions (&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the number of words in the vocabulary).

It is helpful to think of the entities represented by &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; as matrices created by decomposing the original document-word matrix that represents the corpus of documents being modeled. In this view, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; consists of rows defined by documents and columns defined by topics, while &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; consists of rows defined by topics and columns defined by words. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\varphi_1, \dots, \varphi_K&lt;/math&gt;  refers to a set of rows, or vectors, each of which is a distribution over words, and &lt;math&gt;\theta_1, \dots, \theta_M&lt;/math&gt;refers to a set of rows, each of which is a distribution over topics. 

=== Generative process ===
In order to actually infer the topics in a corpus, we imagine a generative process whereby the documents are created, so that we may infer, or reverse engineer, it. We imagine the generative process as follows. Documents are represented as random mixtures over latent topics, where each topic is characterized by a distribution over all the words. LDA assumes the following generative process for a corpus &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; consisting of &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; documents each of length &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt;:

1. Choose &lt;math&gt; \theta_i \sim \operatorname{Dir}(\alpha) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; i \in \{ 1,\dots,M \} &lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Dir}(\alpha) &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Dirichlet distribution]] with a symmetric parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; which typically is sparse (&lt;math&gt;\alpha &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;)

2. Choose &lt;math&gt; \varphi_k \sim \operatorname{Dir}(\beta) &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; k \in \{ 1,\dots,K \} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; typically is sparse

3. For each of the word positions &lt;math&gt;i, j&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; i \in \{ 1,\dots,M \} &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; j \in \{ 1,\dots,N_i \} &lt;/math&gt;

: (a) Choose a topic &lt;math&gt;z_{i,j} \sim\operatorname{Multinomial}(\theta_i). &lt;/math&gt;

: (b) Choose a word &lt;math&gt;w_{i,j} \sim\operatorname{Multinomial}( \varphi_{z_{i,j}}). &lt;/math&gt;

(Note that ''multinomial distribution'' here refers to the [[multinomial distribution|multinomial]] with only one trial, which is also known as the [[categorical distribution]].)

The lengths &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; are treated as independent of all the other data generating variables (&lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;). The subscript is often dropped, as in the plate diagrams shown here.

===Definition===
A formal description of LDA is as follows:

{|class="wikitable"
|+Definition of variables in the model
! Variable !! Type !! Meaning
|-
| &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; || integer || number of topics (e.g. 50)
|-
| &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; || integer || number of words in the vocabulary (e.g. 50,000 or 1,000,000)
|-
| &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; || integer || number of documents
|-
| &lt;math&gt;N_{d=1 \dots M}&lt;/math&gt; || integer || number of words in document ''d''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; || integer || total number of words in all documents; sum of all &lt;math&gt;N_d&lt;/math&gt; values, i.e. &lt;math&gt;N = \sum_{d=1}^{M} N_d&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{k=1 \dots K}&lt;/math&gt; || positive real || prior weight of topic ''k'' in a document; usually the same for all topics; normally a number less than 1, e.g. 0.1, to prefer sparse topic distributions, i.e. few topics per document
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\alpha&lt;/math&gt; || ''K''-dimensional vector of positive reals || collection of all &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k&lt;/math&gt; values, viewed as a single vector
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\beta_{w=1 \dots V}&lt;/math&gt; || positive real || prior weight of word ''w'' in a topic; usually the same for all words; normally a number much less than 1, e.g. 0.001, to strongly prefer sparse word distributions, i.e. few words per topic
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\beta&lt;/math&gt; || ''V''-dimensional vector of positive reals || collection of all &lt;math&gt;\beta_w&lt;/math&gt; values, viewed as a single vector
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\varphi_{k=1 \dots K,w=1 \dots V}&lt;/math&gt; || probability (real number between 0 and 1) || probability of word ''w'' occurring in topic ''k''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\varphi_{k=1 \dots K}&lt;/math&gt; || ''V''-dimensional vector of probabilities, which must sum to 1 || distribution of words in topic ''k''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\theta_{d=1 \dots M,k=1 \dots K}&lt;/math&gt; || probability (real number between 0 and 1) || probability of topic ''k'' occurring in document ''d''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\theta_{d=1 \dots M}&lt;/math&gt; || ''K''-dimensional vector of probabilities, which must sum to 1 || distribution of topics in document ''d''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;z_{d=1 \dots M,w=1 \dots N_d}&lt;/math&gt; || integer between 1 and ''K'' || identity of topic of word ''w'' in document ''d''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt; || ''N''-dimensional vector of integers between 1 and ''K'' || identity of topic of all words in all documents
|-
| &lt;math&gt;w_{d=1 \dots M,w=1 \dots N_d}&lt;/math&gt; || integer between 1 and ''V'' || identity of word ''w'' in document ''d''
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{W}&lt;/math&gt; || ''N''-dimensional vector of integers between 1 and ''V'' || identity of all words in all documents
|}

We can then mathematically describe the random variables as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\boldsymbol\varphi_{k=1 \dots K} &amp;\sim \operatorname{Dirichlet}_V(\boldsymbol\beta) \\
\boldsymbol\theta_{d=1 \dots M} &amp;\sim \operatorname{Dirichlet}_K(\boldsymbol\alpha) \\
z_{d=1 \dots M,w=1 \dots N_d} &amp;\sim \operatorname{Categorical}_K(\boldsymbol\theta_d) \\
w_{d=1 \dots M,w=1 \dots N_d} &amp;\sim \operatorname{Categorical}_V(\boldsymbol\varphi_{z_{dw}})
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Learning the various distributions (the set of topics, their associated word probabilities, the topic of each word, and the particular topic mixture of each document) is a problem of [[Bayesian inference]]. The original paper used a [[variational Bayes]] approximation of the [[posterior distribution]];&lt;ref name="blei2003"/&gt; alternative inference techniques use [[Gibbs sampling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Following is the derivation of the equations for [[collapsed Gibbs sampling]], which means &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;s and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;s will be integrated out. For simplicity, in this derivation the documents are all assumed to have the same length &lt;math&gt;N_{}&lt;/math&gt;. The derivation is equally valid if the document lengths vary.

According to the model, the total probability of the model is:

:&lt;math&gt; P(\boldsymbol{W}, \boldsymbol{Z}, \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{\varphi};\alpha,\beta) = \prod_{i=1}^K P(\varphi_i;\beta) \prod_{j=1}^M P(\theta_j;\alpha) \prod_{t=1}^N
P(Z_{j,t}\mid\theta_j)P(W_{j,t}\mid\varphi_{Z_{j,t}}) ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the bold-font variables denote the vector version of the variables. First, &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; need to be integrated out.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; P(\boldsymbol{Z}, \boldsymbol{W};\alpha,\beta) = \int_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \int_{\boldsymbol{\varphi}} P(\boldsymbol{W}, \boldsymbol{Z}, \boldsymbol{\theta}, \boldsymbol{\varphi};\alpha,\beta) \, d\boldsymbol{\varphi} \, d\boldsymbol{\theta} \\
= {} &amp; \int_{\boldsymbol{\varphi}} \prod_{i=1}^K P(\varphi_i;\beta) \prod_{j=1}^M \prod_{t=1}^N P(W_{j,t}\mid\varphi_{Z_{j,t}}) \, d\boldsymbol{\varphi} \int_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \prod_{j=1}^M P(\theta_j;\alpha) \prod_{t=1}^N P(Z_{j,t}\mid\theta_j) \, d\boldsymbol{\theta}.
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

All the &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;s are independent to each other and the same to all the &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;s. So we can treat each &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and each &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; separately. We now focus only on the &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; part.

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \prod_{j=1}^M P(\theta_j;\alpha) \prod_{t=1}^N P(Z_{j,t}\mid\theta_j) \,d\boldsymbol{\theta} = \prod_{j=1}^M \int_{\theta_j} P(\theta_j;\alpha) \prod_{t=1}^N
P(Z_{j,t}\mid\theta_j) \, d\theta_j.&lt;/math&gt;

We can further focus on only one &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; as the following:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\theta_j} P(\theta_j;\alpha) \prod_{t=1}^N P(Z_{j,t}\mid\theta_j) \, d\theta_j .&lt;/math&gt;

Actually, it is the hidden part of the model for the &lt;math&gt;j^{th}&lt;/math&gt; document. Now we replace the probabilities in the above equation by the true distribution expression to write out the explicit equation.

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\theta_j} P(\theta_j;\alpha) \prod_{t=1}^N P(Z_{j,t}\mid\theta_j) \, d\theta_j = \int_{\theta_j} \frac{\Gamma\left (\sum_{i=1}^K \alpha_i \right)}{\prod_{i=1}^K \Gamma(\alpha_i)} \prod_{i=1}^K \theta_{j,i}^{\alpha_i - 1} \prod_{t=1}^N P(Z_{j,t}\mid\theta_j) \, d\theta_j.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;n_{j,r}^i&lt;/math&gt; be the number of word tokens in the &lt;math&gt;j^{th}&lt;/math&gt; document with the same word symbol (the &lt;math&gt;r^{th}&lt;/math&gt; word in the vocabulary) assigned to the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; topic. So, &lt;math&gt;n_{j,r}^i&lt;/math&gt; is three dimensional. If any of the three dimensions is not limited to a specific value, we use a parenthesized point &lt;math&gt;(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; to
denote. For example, &lt;math&gt;n_{j,(\cdot)}^i&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of word tokens in the &lt;math&gt;j^{th}&lt;/math&gt; document assigned to the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; topic. Thus, the right most part of the above equation can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{t=1}^N P(Z_{j,t}\mid\theta_j)  =  \prod_{i=1}^K \theta_{j,i}^{n_{j,(\cdot)}^i} .&lt;/math&gt;

So the &lt;math&gt;\theta_j&lt;/math&gt; integration formula can be changed to:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\theta_j} \frac{\Gamma\left (\sum_{i=1}^K \alpha_i \right)}{\prod_{i=1}^K \Gamma(\alpha_i)} \prod_{i=1}^K \theta_{j,i}^{\alpha_i - 1} \prod_{i=1}^K \theta_{j,i}^{n_{j,(\cdot)}^i} \, d\theta_j = \int_{\theta_j} \frac{\Gamma\left (\sum_{i=1}^K \alpha_i \right)}{\prod_{i=1}^K \Gamma(\alpha_i)} \prod_{i=1}^K \theta_{j,i}^{n_{j,(\cdot)}^i+\alpha_i - 1} \, d\theta_j.&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly, the equation inside the integration has the same form as the [[Dirichlet distribution]]. According to the [[Dirichlet distribution]],

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\theta_j} \frac{\Gamma\left (\sum_{i=1}^K n_{j,(\cdot)}^i+\alpha_i \right)}{\prod_{i=1}^K \Gamma(n_{j,(\cdot)}^i+\alpha_i)} \prod_{i=1}^K \theta_{j,i}^{n_{j,(\cdot)}^i+\alpha_i - 1} \, d\theta_j =1 .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; \int_{\theta_j} P(\theta_j;\alpha) \prod_{t=1}^N P(Z_{j,t}\mid\theta_j) \, d\theta_j = \int_{\theta_j} \frac{\Gamma\left (\sum_{i=1}^K \alpha_i \right)}{\prod_{i=1}^K \Gamma(\alpha_i)} \prod_{i=1}^K \theta_{j,i}^{n_{j,(\cdot)}^i+\alpha_i - 1} \, d\theta_j \\ [8pt]
= {} &amp; \frac{\Gamma\left (\sum_{i=1}^K \alpha_i \right )}{\prod_{i=1}^K \Gamma(\alpha_i)}\frac{\prod_{i=1}^K \Gamma(n_{j,(\cdot)}^i+\alpha_i)}{\Gamma\left (\sum_{i=1}^K n_{j,(\cdot)}^i+\alpha_i \right )} \int_{\theta_j} \frac{\Gamma\left (\sum_{i=1}^K n_{j,(\cdot)}^i+\alpha_i \right)}{\prod_{i=1}^K \Gamma(n_{j,(\cdot)}^i+\alpha_i)} \prod_{i=1}^K \theta_{j,i}^{n_{j,(\cdot)}^i+\alpha_i - 1} \, d\theta_j \\ [8pt]

\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Now we turn our attention to the &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; part. Actually, the derivation of the &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; part is very similar to the &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; part. Here we only list the steps of the derivation:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; \int_{\boldsymbol{\varphi}} \prod_{i=1}^K P(\varphi_i;\beta) \prod_{j=1}^M \prod_{t=1}^N P(W_{j,t}\mid\varphi_{Z_{j,t}}) \, d\boldsymbol{\varphi} \\[8pt]
= {} &amp; \prod_{i=1}^K \int_{\varphi_i} P(\varphi_i;\beta) \prod_{j=1}^M \prod_{t=1}^N P(W_{j,t}\mid \varphi_{Z_{j,t}}) \, d\varphi_i\\ [8pt]
= {} &amp; \prod_{i=1}^K \int_{\varphi_i} \frac{\Gamma\left(\sum_{r=1}^V \beta_r \right)}{\prod_{r=1}^V \Gamma(\beta_r)} \prod_{r=1}^V \varphi_{i,r}^{\beta_r - 1}  \prod_{r=1}^V \varphi_{i,r}^{n_{(\cdot),r}^i} \, d\varphi_i \\ [8pt]
= {} &amp; \prod_{i=1}^K \int_{\varphi_i} \frac{\Gamma\left(\sum_{r=1}^V \beta_r \right)}{\prod_{r=1}^V \Gamma(\beta_r)} \prod_{r=1}^V \varphi_{i,r}^{n_{(\cdot),r}^i+\beta_r - 1} \, d\varphi_i \\ [8pt]
= {} &amp; \prod_{i=1}^K \frac{\Gamma\left(\sum_{r=1}^V \beta_r \right)}{\prod_{r=1}^V \Gamma(\beta_r)}\frac{\prod_{r=1}^V \Gamma(n_{(\cdot),r}^i+\beta_r)}{\Gamma\left(\sum_{r=1}^V n_{(\cdot),r}^i+\beta_r \right)}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For clarity, here we write down the final equation with both &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; integrated out:

:&lt;math&gt; P(\boldsymbol{Z}, \boldsymbol{W};\alpha,\beta) =  \prod_{j=1}^M  \frac{\Gamma\left(\sum_{i=1}^K \alpha_i \right )}{\prod_{i=1}^K \Gamma(\alpha_i)}\frac{\prod_{i=1}^K \Gamma(n_{j,(\cdot)}^i+\alpha_i)}{\Gamma\left (\sum_{i=1}^K n_{j,(\cdot)}^i+\alpha_i \right)} \times \prod_{i=1}^K \frac{\Gamma\left (\sum_{r=1}^V \beta_r \right )}{\prod_{r=1}^V \Gamma(\beta_r)}\frac{\prod_{r=1}^V
\Gamma(n_{(\cdot),r}^i+\beta_r)}{\Gamma\left (\sum_{r=1}^V n_{(\cdot),r}^i+\beta_r \right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The goal of Gibbs Sampling here is to approximate the distribution of &lt;math&gt;P(\boldsymbol{Z}\mid\boldsymbol{W};\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;P(\boldsymbol{W};\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; is invariable for any of Z, Gibbs Sampling equations can be derived from &lt;math&gt;P(\boldsymbol{Z}, \boldsymbol{W};\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; directly. The key point is to derive the following conditional probability:

:&lt;math&gt; P(Z_{(m,n)}\mid\boldsymbol{Z_{-(m,n)}}, \boldsymbol{W};\alpha,\beta)=\frac{P(Z_{(m,n)}, \boldsymbol{Z_{-(m,n)}},\boldsymbol{W};\alpha,\beta)} {P(\boldsymbol{Z_{-(m,n)}}, \boldsymbol{W};\alpha,\beta)} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Z_{(m,n)}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; hidden variable of the &lt;math&gt;n^{th}&lt;/math&gt; word token in the &lt;math&gt;m^{th}&lt;/math&gt; document. And further we assume that the word
symbol of it is the &lt;math&gt;v^{th}&lt;/math&gt; word in the vocabulary. &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{Z_{-(m,n)}}&lt;/math&gt; denotes all the &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;s but &lt;math&gt;Z_{(m,n)}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that Gibbs Sampling needs only to sample a value for &lt;math&gt;Z_{(m,n)}&lt;/math&gt;, according to the above probability, we do not need the exact value of

:&lt;math&gt;P \left (Z_{m,n}\mid\boldsymbol{Z_{-(m,n)}}, \boldsymbol{W};\alpha,\beta \right )&lt;/math&gt;

but the ratios among the probabilities that &lt;math&gt;Z_{(m,n)}&lt;/math&gt; can take value. So, the above equation can be simplified as:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
P (&amp;Z_{(m,n)}=k\mid \boldsymbol{Z_{-(m,n)}}, \boldsymbol{W};\alpha,\beta ) \\ [8pt]
&amp;\propto P (Z_{(m,n)}=k,\boldsymbol{Z_{-(m,n)}},\boldsymbol{W};\alpha,\beta ) \\ [8pt]
&amp;= \left(\frac{\Gamma\left(\sum_{i=1}^K \alpha_i \right)}{\prod_{i=1}^K \Gamma(\alpha_i)}\right)^M \prod_{j\neq m} \frac{\prod_{i=1}^K \Gamma \left (n_{j,(\cdot)}^i+\alpha_i \right )}{\Gamma\left (\sum_{i=1}^K n_{j,(\cdot)}^i+\alpha_i \right)} \left( \frac{\Gamma\left (\sum_{r=1}^V \beta_r \right)}{\prod_{r=1}^V \Gamma(\beta_r)}\right)^K \prod_{i=1}^K \prod_{r\neq v} \Gamma \left (n_{(\cdot),r}^i+\beta_r \right )\frac{\prod_{i=1}^K \Gamma \left (n_{m,(\cdot)}^i+\alpha_i \right )}{\Gamma\left (\sum_{i=1}^K n_{m,(\cdot)}^i+\alpha_i \right )}  \prod_{i=1}^K \frac{ \Gamma \left (n_{(\cdot),v}^i+\beta_v \right )} {\Gamma \left (\sum_{r=1}^V n_{(\cdot),r}^i+\beta_r \right )} \\ [8pt]
&amp;\propto \frac{\prod_{i=1}^K \Gamma \left (n_{m,(\cdot)}^i+\alpha_i \right )}{\Gamma\left (\sum_{i=1}^K n_{m,(\cdot)}^i+\alpha_i \right)}  \prod_{i=1}^K \frac{ \Gamma \left (n_{(\cdot),v}^i+\beta_v \right )}{\Gamma\left  (\sum_{r=1}^V n_{(\cdot),r}^i+\beta_r \right )}\\ [8pt]
&amp;\propto \prod_{i=1}^K \Gamma \left (n_{m,(\cdot)}^i+\alpha_i \right )  \prod_{i=1}^K \frac{\Gamma \left (n_{(\cdot),v}^i+\beta_v \right )}{\Gamma\left (\sum_{r=1}^V n_{(\cdot),r}^i+\beta_r \right )}.
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Finally, let &lt;math&gt;n_{j,r}^{i,-(m,n)}&lt;/math&gt; be the same meaning as &lt;math&gt;n_{j,r}^i&lt;/math&gt; but with the &lt;math&gt;Z_{(m,n)}&lt;/math&gt; excluded. The above equation can be further simplified leveraging the property of [[gamma function]]. We first split the summation and then merge it back to obtain a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-independent summation, which could be dropped:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp;\propto \prod_{i\neq k} \Gamma \left (n_{m,(\cdot)}^{i,-(m,n)}+\alpha_i \right ) \prod_{i\neq k} \frac{ \Gamma \left (n_{(\cdot),v}^{i,-(m,n)}+\beta_v \right )}{\Gamma\left (\sum_{r=1}^V n_{(\cdot),r}^{i,-(m,n)}+\beta_r \right )} \Gamma \left (n_{m,(\cdot)}^{k,-(m,n)}+\alpha_k + 1 \right ) \frac{\Gamma \left (n_{(\cdot),v}^{k,-(m,n)}+\beta_v + 1 \right )}{\Gamma\left(\sum_{r=1}^V n_{(\cdot),r}^{k,-(m,n)} + \beta_r +1 \right)} \\ [8pt]
&amp;= \prod_{i\neq k} \Gamma \left (n_{m,(\cdot)}^{i,-(m,n)}+\alpha_i \right ) \prod_{i\neq k} \frac{\Gamma \left (n_{(\cdot),v}^{i,-(m,n)}+\beta_v \right )}{\Gamma\left (\sum_{r=1}^V n_{(\cdot),r}^{i,-(m,n)} + \beta_r \right )} \Gamma \left (n_{m,(\cdot)}^{k,-(m,n)}+\alpha_k \right ) \frac{\Gamma \left (n_{(\cdot),v}^{k,-(m,n)}+\beta_v \right )} {\Gamma\left (\sum_{r=1}^V n_{(\cdot),r}^{k,-(m,n)}+\beta_r \right )} \left  (n_{m,(\cdot)}^{k,-(m,n)}+\alpha_k \right ) \frac{n_{(\cdot),v}^{k,-(m,n)}+\beta_v } {\sum_{r=1}^V n_{(\cdot),r}^{k,-(m,n)}+\beta_r} \\ [8pt]
&amp;= \prod_{i} \Gamma \left (n_{m,(\cdot)}^{i,-(m,n)}+\alpha_i \right ) \prod_{i} \frac{ \Gamma \left (n_{(\cdot),v}^{i,-(m,n)}+\beta_v \right )}{\Gamma\left (\sum_{r=1}^V n_{(\cdot),r}^{i,-(m,n)}+\beta_r \right )} \left (n_{m,(\cdot)}^{k,-(m,n)}+\alpha_k \right ) \frac{n_{(\cdot),v}^{k,-(m,n)}+\beta_v } {\sum_{r=1}^V n_{(\cdot),r}^{k,-(m,n)}+\beta_r} \\ [8pt]
&amp;\propto \left (n_{m,(\cdot)}^{k,-(m,n)}+\alpha_k \right ) \frac{n_{(\cdot),v}^{k,-(m,n)}+\beta_v } {\sum_{r=1}^V n_{(\cdot),r}^{k,-(m,n)}+\beta_r}
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

Note that the same formula is derived in the article on the [[Dirichlet-multinomial distribution#A combined example: LDA topic models|Dirichlet-multinomial distribution]], as part of a more general discussion of integrating [[Dirichlet distribution]] priors out of a [[Bayesian network]].

== Faster sampling ==

Recent research has been focused on speeding up the inference of latent Dirichlet Allocation to support the capture of a massive number of topics in a large number of documents. The update equation of the collapsed Gibbs sampler mentioned in the earlier section has a natural sparsity within it that can be taken advantage of. Intuitively, since each document only contains a subset of topics &lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt;, and a word also only appears in a subset of topics &lt;math&gt;K_w&lt;/math&gt;, the above update equation could be rewritten to take advantage of this sparsity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference
 | last = Yao
 | first = Limin |author2=Mimno, David |author3=McCallum, Andrew

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;p(Z_{d,n} = k) \propto \frac{\alpha\beta}{C_k^{\neg n} + V\beta} + \frac{C_k^d \beta}{C_k^{\neg n} + V\beta} + \frac{C_k^w(\alpha + C_k^d)}{C_k^{\neg n} + V\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, we have three terms, out of which two of them are sparse, and the other is small. We call these terms &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Now, if we normalize each term by summing over all the topics, we get:

: &lt;math&gt;
A = \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{\alpha\beta}{C_k^{\neg n} + V\beta}
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
B = \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{C_k^d \beta}{C_k^{\neg n} + V\beta}
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
C = \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{C_k^w(\alpha + C_k^d)}{C_k^{\neg n} + V\beta}
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, we can see that &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a summation of the topics that appear in document &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is also a sparse summation of the topics that a word &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is assigned to across the whole corpus. &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; on the other hand, is dense but because of the small values of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; &amp; &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, the value is very small compared to the two other terms.

Now, while sampling a topic, if we sample a random variable uniformly from &lt;math&gt;s \sim U(s|\mid A+B+C)&lt;/math&gt;, we can check which bucket our sample lands in. Since &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is small, we are very unlikely to fall into this bucket; however, if we do fall into this bucket, sampling a topic takes O(K) time (same as the original Collapsed Gibbs Sampler). However, if we fall into the other two buckets, we only need to check a subset of topics if we keep a record of the sparse topics. A topic can be sampled from the &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; bucket in &lt;math&gt;O(K_d)&lt;/math&gt; time, and a topic can be sampled from the &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; bucket in &lt;math&gt;O(K_w)&lt;/math&gt; time where &lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_w&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of topics assigned to the current document and current word type respectively.

Notice that after sampling each topic, updating these buckets is all basic &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; arithmetic operations.

== Applications, extensions and similar techniques ==
Topic modeling is a classic problem in [[information retrieval]]. Related models and techniques are, among others, [[latent semantic indexing]], [[independent component analysis]], [[probabilistic latent semantic indexing]], [[non-negative matrix factorization]], and [[Gamma-Poisson distribution]].

The LDA model is highly modular and can therefore be easily extended. The main field of interest is modeling relations between topics. This is achieved by using another distribution on the simplex instead of the Dirichlet. The Correlated Topic Model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; follows this approach, inducing a correlation structure between topics by using the [[logistic normal distribution]] instead of the Dirichlet. Another extension is the hierarchical LDA (hLDA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; where topics are joined together in a hierarchy by using the nested [[Chinese restaurant process]]. LDA can also be extended to a corpus in which a document includes two types of information (e.g., words and names), as in the [[LDA-dual model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nonparametric extensions of LDA include the [[hierarchical Dirichlet process]] mixture model, which allows the number of topics to be unbounded and learnt from data and the nested Chinese restaurant process which allows topics to be arranged in a hierarchy whose structure is learnt from data.

As noted earlier, pLSA is similar to LDA. The LDA model is essentially the Bayesian version of pLSA model. The Bayesian formulation tends to perform better on small datasets because Bayesian methods can avoid overfitting the data. For very large datasets, the results of the two models tend to converge. One difference is that pLSA uses a variable &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; to represent a document in the training set. So in pLSA, when presented with a document the model hasn't seen before, we fix &lt;math&gt;\Pr(w \mid z)&lt;/math&gt;—the probability of words under topics—to be that learned from the training set and use the same EM algorithm to infer &lt;math&gt;\Pr(z \mid d)&lt;/math&gt;—the topic distribution under &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;. Blei argues that this step is cheating because you are essentially refitting the model to the new data.

Variations on LDA have been used to automatically put natural images into categories, such as "bedroom" or "forest", by treating an image as a document, and small patches of the image as words;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Fei-Fei|author2=Perona, Pietro |title=A Bayesian Hierarchical Model for Learning Natural Scene Categories|journal=Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'05)|volume=2|pages=524–531}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the variations is called [[Spatial Latent Dirichlet Allocation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Xiaogang|author2=Grimson, Eric |title=Spatial Latent Dirichlet Allocation|journal=Proceedings of Neural Information Processing Systems Conference (NIPS)|year=2007|url = http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/NIPS2007_102.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Macro analysis chords on C.png|thumb|300px|right|Macro analysis for triads on C.]]

In [[music theory]], '''macro analysis''' is a method of transcribing, or writing down [[chord (music)|chords]] that may be used along with or instead of conventional [[Roman numeral analysis]] used in [[musical analysis]]. Macro analysis is placed above the [[staff (musical)|staff]] while Roman numeral analysis is placed under the staff and, like all analysis, macro analysis may be considered a generalization; for example, [[nonchord tone]]s are not recorded in macro analysis. The [http://www.macromusic.org macromusic] website defines it as 
:"a listening-based analytical system which views music via harmonic motion to and from a target chord or [[tonic (music)|tonic]]. Its traditional application involves tonal music based upon "circle-of-fifths" root motion, however, this application can be extended to include other kinds of music that involve some sort of regular, directed harmonic motion."
The method was invented by Bruce Benward and is described in Benward &amp; Saker's ''Music: In Theory and Practice''. Uppercase or lowercase letters are used to indicate the [[root (chord)|roots]] of chords, followed by symbols which specify the chord quality.&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"&gt;Benward, Bruce &amp; Saker, Marilyn (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', Vol. I, p.74-75. Seventh Edition. McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "''Macro analysis'' is an analytical technique that may be employed along with, or instead of, more conventional methods of analysis [such as Roman numeral analysis]. The system employs letter names to indicate the roots of chords, accompanied by specific symbols to depict chord quality."&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"/&gt;

Macro analysis, traditionally placed below the score, may be accompanied by Roman numeral analysis, in which case the macro analysis is placed above the score.&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"/&gt;

'''Mathematical sociology''' is the area of [[sociology]] that uses [[mathematics]] to construct social theories.  Mathematical sociology aims to take sociological theory, which is strong in intuitive content but weak from a formal point of view, and to express it in formal terms.  The benefits of this approach include increased clarity and the ability to use mathematics to derive implications of a theory that cannot be arrived at intuitively.  In mathematical sociology, the preferred style is encapsulated in the phrase "constructing a mathematical model."   This means making specified assumptions about some social phenomenon, expressing them in formal mathematics, and providing an empirical interpretation for the ideas.  It also means deducing properties of the model and comparing these with relevant empirical data.  [[Social network analysis]] is the best-known contribution of this subfield to sociology as a whole and to the scientific community at large. The models typically used in mathematical sociology allow sociologists to understand how predictable local interactions are and they are often able to elicit global patterns of social structure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soc.cornell.edu/research/mathematical_sociology.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Starting in the early 1940s, [[Nicolas Rashevsky]],&lt;ref&gt;* Nicolas Rashevsky.: 1947/1949 (2nd ed.). ''Mathematical Theory of Human Relations: An Approach to Mathematical Biology of Social Phenomena''. Bloomington, ID: Principia Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* Nicolas Rashevsky. 1938/1948 (2nd ed.).'' Mathematical Biophysics:Physico-Mathematical Foundations of Biology''., University of Chicago Press : Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in the late 1940s, [[Anatol Rapoport]] and others, developed a [[relation algebra|relational]] and probabilistic approach to the characterization of large [[social network]]s in which the nodes are persons and the links are acquaintanceship. During the late 1940s, formulas were derived that connected local parameters such as closure of contacts – if A is linked to both B and C, then there is a greater than chance probability that B and C are linked to each other – to the global network property of connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Rapoport, Anatol. (1957).  "Contributions to the Theory of Random and Biased Nets." ''Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics'' 19: 257-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, acquaintanceship is a ''positive tie'', but what about ''negative ties'' such as animosity among persons?  To tackle this problem, [[graph theory]], which is the mathematical study of abstract representations of networks of points and lines, can be extended to include these two types of links and thereby to create models that represent both positive and negative sentiment relations, which are represented as [[signed graph]]s.  A signed graph is called ''balanced'' if the product of the signs of all relations in every cycle (links in every graph cycle) is positive.  Through formalization by mathematician [[Frank Harary]] this work produced the fundamental theorem of this theory.  It says that if a network of interrelated positive and negative ties is balanced, e.g. as illustrated by the psychological principle that "my friend's enemy is my enemy", then it consists of two subnetworks such that each has positive ties among its nodes and there are only negative ties between nodes in distinct subnetworks.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, Dorwin &amp; Harary, Frank. (1956).  "[[Structural Balance]]: A Generalization of Heider's Theory."  ''Psychological Review'' 63:277-293.&lt;/ref&gt;  The imagery here is of a social system that splits into two cliques. There is, however, a special case where one of the two subnetworks is empty, which might occur in very small networks.
In another model, ties have relative strengths. 'Acquaintanceship' can be viewed as a 'weak' tie and 'friendship' is represented as a strong tie.  Like its uniform cousin discussed above, there is a concept of closure, called strong triadic closure.  A graph satisfies strong triadic closure If A is strongly connected to B, and B is strongly connected to C, then A and C must have a tie (either weak or strong).

n these two developments we have mathematical models bearing upon the analysis of structure.  Other early influential developments in mathematical sociology pertained to process.  For instance, in 1952 [[Herbert A. Simon]] produced a mathematical formalization of a published theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Homans |first1=George C |title=The Human Group |date=1950 |publisher=Harcourt, Brace and World |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[social groups]] by constructing a model consisting of a deterministic system of differential equations.  A formal study of the system led to theorems about the dynamics and the implied [[equilibrium state]]s of any group.

The emergence of mathematical models in the social sciences was part of the zeitgeist in the 1940s and 1950s in which a variety of new interdisciplinary scientific innovations occurred, such as [[information theory]], [[game theory]], [[cybernetics]] and mathematical model building in the social and behavioral sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lazarsfeld |first1=Paul F |last2=Henry |first2=Neil W |title=Editors. Readings in Mathematical Social Science |date=1966 |publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further developments==

In 1954, a critical expository analysis of Rashevsky's social behavior models was written by sociologist James S. Coleman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coleman |first1=James S |title=An expository analysis of some of Rashevsky's social behavior models |journal=Mathematical Thinking in the Social Sciences edited by Paul F. Lazarsfeld |date=1954 |issue=New York: The Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rashevsky's models and as well as the model constructed by Simon raise a question: how can one connect such theoretical models to the data of sociology, which often take the form of surveys in which the results are expressed in the form of proportions of people believing or doing something.  This suggests deriving the equations from assumptions about the chances of an individual changing state in a small interval of time, a procedure well known in the mathematics of [[stochastic processes]].

Coleman embodied this idea in his 1964 book ''Introduction to Mathematical Sociology'', which showed how stochastic processes in social networks could be analyzed in such a way as to enable testing of the constructed model by comparison with the relevant data. The same idea can and has been applied to processes of change in social relations, an active research theme in the study of social networks, illustrated by an empirical study appearing in the journal Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kossinets |first1=Gueorgi |last2=Watts |first2=Duncan J |title=An empirical analysis of an evolving social network |journal=Science |date=2006 |volume=311 |issue=5757 |pages=88-90}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In other work, Coleman employed mathematical ideas drawn from economics, such as [[general equilibrium theory]], to argue that general social theory should begin with a concept of [[purposive action]] and, for analytical reasons, approximate such action by the use of [[rational choice]] models (Coleman, 1990).  This argument is similar to viewpoints expressed by other sociologists in their efforts to use rational choice theory in sociological analysis although such efforts have met with substantive and philosophical criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coleman |first1=James S |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |title=Rational Choice Theory: Advocacy and Critique. Editors. |date=1992 |publisher=Sage |location=Newbury Park, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, structural analysis of the type indicated earlier received a further extension to social networks based on institutionalized social relations, notably those of kinship.  The linkage of mathematics and sociology here involved abstract algebra, in particular, [[group theory]].&lt;ref&gt;White, Harrison C. 1963. An Anatomy of Kinship. Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt;  This, in turn, led to a focus on a data-analytical version of homomorphic reduction of a complex social network (which along with many other techniques is presented in [[Stanley Wasserman|Wasserman]] and Faust 1994&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Wasserman|Wasserman, S.]], &amp; Faust, K.. Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications. New York and Cambridge, ENG: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In regard to Rapoport's random and biased net theory, his 1961 study of a large sociogram, co-authored with Horvath turned out to become a very influential paper. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rapoport |first1=Anatol |last2=Horvath |first2=N J |title=A study of a large sociogram |journal=Behavioral Science |date=1961 |volume=6 |pages=279-291}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was early evidence of this influence. In 1964, Thomas Fararo and a co-author analyzed another large friendship sociogram using a biased net model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |last2=Sunshine |first2=Morris |title=A Study of Biased Friendship Net |date=1964 |publisher=Youth Development Center and Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 1960s, Stanley Milgram described the small world problem and undertook a field experiment dealing with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Milgram |first1=Stanley |title=The small world problem |journal=Psychology Today |date=May 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Travers |first1=Jeffrey |last2=Milgram |first2=Stanley |title=An experimental study of the small world problem |journal=Sociometry |date=1969 |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=425-443}}&lt;/ref&gt; A highly fertile idea was suggested and applied by Mark Granovetter in which he drew upon Rapoport's 1961 paper to suggest and apply a distinction between weak and strong ties. The key idea was that there was "strength" in weak ties. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Granovetter |first1=Mark |title=The Strength of Weak Ties |journal=American Journal of Sociology |date=1973 |volume=78 |pages=1360-1380}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some programs of research in sociology employ experimental methods to study social interaction processes.  [[Joseph Berger (sociologist)|Joseph Berger]] and his colleagues initiated such a program in which the central idea is the use of the theoretical concept "expectation state" to construct theoretical models to explain interpersonal processes, e.g., those linking external status in society to differential influence in local group decision-making. Much of this theoretical work is linked to mathematical model building, especially after the late 1970s adoption of a graph theoretic representation of social information processing, as Berger (2000) describes in looking back upon the development of his program of research. In 1962 he and his collaborators explained model building by reference to the goal of the model builder, which could be explication of a concept in a theory, representation of a single recurrent social process, or a broad theory based on a theoretical construct, such as, respectively, the concept of balance in psychological and social structures, the process of conformity in an experimental situation, and stimulus sampling theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Joseph |last2=Cohen |first2=Bernard P |last3=Snell |first3=J Laurie |last4=Zelditch Jr |first4=Morris |title=Types of Formalization |date=1962 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The generations of mathematical sociologists that followed Rapoport, Simon, Harary, Coleman, White and Berger, including those entering the field in the 1960s such as Thomas Fararo, Philip Bonacich, and Tom Mayer, among others, drew upon their work in a variety of ways.

==Present research==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
Mathematical sociology remains a small subfield within the discipline, but it has succeeded in spawning a number of other subfields which share its goals of formally modeling social life.  The foremost of these fields is [[social network analysis]], which has become among the fastest growing areas of sociology in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scott |first1=John |title=Social Network Analysis. 4th Edition. |date=2017 |publisher=Sage |location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other major development in the field is the rise of [[computational sociology]], which expands the mathematical toolkit with the use of [[computer simulation]]s, [[artificial intelligence]] and advanced statistical methods.  The latter subfield also makes use of the vast new data sets on social activity generated by social interaction on the internet.

One important indicator of the significance of mathematical sociology is that the general interest journals in the field, including such central journals as ''The American Journal of Sociology'' and ''The American Sociological Review'', have published mathematical models that became influential in the field at large.  

More recent trends in mathematical sociology are evident in contributions to ''The Journal of Mathematical Sociology'' (JMS).  Several trends stand out: the further development of formal theories that explain experimental data dealing with small group processes, the continuing interest in structural balance as a major mathematical and theoretical idea, the interpenetration of mathematical models oriented to theory and innovative quantitative techniques relating to methodology, the use of computer simulations to study problems in social complexity, interest in [[micro–macro linkage]] and the problem of emergence, and ever-increasing research on networks of social relations.  
 
Thus, topics from the earliest days, like balance and network models, continue to be of contemporary interest. The formal techniques employed remain many of the standard and well-known methods of mathematics: differential equations, stochastic processes and game theory. Newer tools like agent-based models used in computer simulation studies are prominently represented. Perennial substantive problems still drive research: [[social diffusion]], [[social influence]], [[social status]] origins and consequences, segregation, cooperation, [[collective action]], power, and much more.
 
== Research programs== 
Many of the developments in mathematical sociology, including [[Formal theory (political science)|formal theory]], have exhibited notable decades-long advances that began with path-setting contributions by leading mathematical sociologists and formal theorists.  This provides another way of taking note of recent contributions but with an emphasis on continuity with early work through the use of the idea of “[[research program]],” which is a coherent series of theoretical and empirical studies based on some fundamental principle or approach.  There are more than a few of these programs and what follows is no more than a brief capsule description of leading exemplars of this idea in which there is an emphasis on the originating leadership in each program and its further development over decades.

(1) [[Rational Choice Theory]] and James S. Coleman: After his 1964 pioneering ''Introduction to Mathematical Sociology'', Coleman continued to make contributions to social theory and mathematical model building and his 1990 volume, ''Foundations of Social Theory'' was the major theoretical work of a career that spanned the period from 1950s to 1990s and included many other research-based contributions..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Jon  Editor |title=James S Coleman |date=1996 |publisher=Routledge. Taylor and Francis Group |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Foundation book combined accessible examples of how rational choice theory could function in the analysis of such sociological topics as authority, [[trust (emotion)|trust]], [[social capital]] and the [[Social norm|norm]]s (in particular, their emergence).  In this way, the book showed how rational choice theory could provide an effective basis for making the transition from micro to macro levels of sociological explanation.  An important feature of the book is its use of mathematical ideas in generalizing the rational choice model to include [[interpersonal sentiment relations]] as modifiers of outcomes and doing so such that the generalized theory captures the original more self-oriented theory as a special case, as point emphasized in a later analysis of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |title=Social Action Systems |date=2001 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, CT |pages=255-278 (Ch. 11)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationality presupposition of the theory led to debates among sociological theorists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coleman |first1=James S. |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J. |title=Editors.  Rational Choice Theory: Advocacy and Critique |date=1992 |publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Nevertheless, many sociologists drew upon Coleman’s formulation of a general template for micro-macro transition to gain leverage on the continuation of topics central to his and the discipline's explanatory focus on a variety of macrosocial phenomena in which rational choice simplified the micro level in the interest of combining individual actions to account for macro outcomes of social processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raub |first1=Werner |last2=Buskens |first2=Vincent |last3=Van Assen |first3=Marcel |title=Micro-macro links and microfoundations in sociology |journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology |date=2011 |volume=35 |pages=1-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
(2) [[Structuralism (Formal)]] and Harrison C. White: In the decades since his earliest contributions, Harrison White has led the field in putting social structural analysis on a mathematical and empirical basis, including the 1970 publication of ''Chains of Opportunity: System Models of Mobility in Organization''s which set out and applied to data a [[vacancy chain]] model for mobility in and across organizations.   His very influential other work includes the operational concepts of [[blockmodel]] and [[structural equivalence]] which start from a body of social relational data to produce analytical results using these procedures and concepts.   These ideas and methods were developed in collaboration with his former students [[François Lorraine]], [[Ronald Breiger]], and [[Scott Boorman]]. These three are among the more than 30 students who earned their doctorates under White in the period 1963-1986. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Azarian |first1=Reza |title=The General Sociology of Harrison White |date=2003 |publisher=Department of Sociology, Stockholm University |location=Stockholm, Sweden |isbn=91-7265-603-4 |pages=213-216 |ref=Azarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory and application of blockmodels has been set out in detail in a recent monograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Doreian |first1=Patrick |last2=Batagelj |first2=Vladimir |last3=Ferligoj |first3=Anuska |title=Generalized Blockmodeling |date=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, U.K. |isbn=0-521-84085-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;. White's later contributions include a structuralist approach to markets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=White |first1=Harrison C. |title=Markets from Networks: Socioeconomic Models of Production |date=2002 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1992, a general theoretical framework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=White |first1=Harrison C. |title=Identity and Control: A Structural Theory of Social Action |date=1992 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;, later appearing in a revised edition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=White |first1=Harrison C. |title=Identity and Control |date=2008 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
(3) [[Expectation states theory]] and Joseph Berger: Under Berger’s intellectual and organizational leadership, Expectation States Theory branched out into a large number of specific programs of research on specific problems, each treated in terms of the master concept of expectation states.  He and his colleague and frequent collaborator [[Morris Zelditch Jr]] not only produced work of their own but created a doctoral program at Stanford University that led to an enormous outpouring of research by notable former students, including [[Murray Webster]], [[David Wagner (sociologist)|David Wagner]], and [[Hamit Fisek]].  Collaboration with mathematician [[Robert Z. Norman]] led to the use of mathematical graph theory as a way of representing and analyzing social information processing in self-other(s) interactions.  Berger and Zelditch also advanced work in formal theorizing and mathematical model building as early as 1962 with a collaborative expository analysis of types of models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Joseph |last2=Cohen |first2=Bernard P. |last3=Snell |first3=J. Laurie |last4=Zelditch Jr |first4=Morris |title=Types of Formalization |date=1962 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Berger and Zelditch stimulated advances in other theoretical research programs by providing outlets for the publication of new work, culminating in a 2002 edited volume&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Joseph |last2=Zelditch Jr |first2=Morris |title=New Directions in Contemporary Sociological Theory |date=2002 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |location=Lanham, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; that  includes a chapter that presents an authoritative overview of [[Expectation states theory]] as a program of cumulative research dealing with [[group processes]].
 
(4) Formalization in [[Theoretical Sociology]] and Thomas J. Fararo: Many of this sociologist’s contributions have been devoted to bringing mathematical thinking into greater contact with sociological theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J. |title=Editor. Mathematical Ideas and Sociological Theory: Current State and Prospects |date=1984 |publisher=Gordon and Breach |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He organized a symposium attended by sociological theorists in which formal theorists delivered papers that were subsequently published in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J. |title=Symposium on Formal Theory |journal=Sociological Theory |date=November 2000 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=475-523}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through collaborations with students and colleagues his own theoretical research program dealt with such topics as [[macrostructural theory]] and [[E-state structuralism]] (both with former student [[John Skvoretz]]), [[subjective images of stratification]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |last2=Kosaka |first2=Kenji |title=Generating Images of Stratification: A Formal Theory |date=2003 |publisher=Springer |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with former student [[Kenji Kosaka]]), [[tripartite structural analysis]] (with colleague [[Patrick Doreian]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |last2=Doreian |first2=Patrick |title=Tripartite structural analysis |journal=Social Networks |date=1984 |volume=6 |pages=141-175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[computational sociology]] (with colleague [[Norman P. Hummon]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hummon |first1=Norman P |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |title=The emergence of computational sociology |journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology |date=1995 |volume=20 |issue=2-3 |pages=79-87}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hummon |first1=Norman P |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |title=Actors and networks as objects |journal=Social Networks |date=1995 |volume=17 |pages=1-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his books are extended treatments of his approach to theoretical sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas |title=Social Action Systems |date=2001 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |title=The Meaning of General Theoretical Sociology: Tradition and Formalization |date=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
(5) Social Network Analysis and [[Linton C. Freeman]]:  In the early 1960s Freeman directed a sophisticated empirical study of [[community power structure]].  In 1978 he established the journal ''Social Networks.''  It rapidly became a major outlet for original research papers that used mathematical techniques to analyze network data.  The journal also publishes conceptual and theoretical contributions, including his paper “[[Centrality]] in Social Networks: Conceptual Clarification.” The paper has been cited more than 13,000 times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Linton C Freeman |website=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In turn, the mathematical concept defined in that paper led to further elaborations of the ideas, to experimental tests, and to numerous applications in empirical studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Freeman |first1=Linton C |last2=Roeder |first2=Douglas |last3=Mulholland |first3=Robert |title=Centrality in social networks II. Experimental results |journal=Social Networks |date=1979-1980 |volume=2 |pages=119-141}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the author of a study of the history and sociology of the field of social network analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=Linton C |title=The development of social network analysis: a study in the sociology of science |date=2004 |publisher=BookSurge |location=North Charleston, SC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
(6) [[Quantitative Methodology]] and [[Kenneth C. Land]]: Kenneth Land has been on the frontier of quantitative methodology in sociology as well as formal theoretical model building.  The influential yearly volume ''Sociological Methodology'' has been one of Land’s favorite outlets for the publication of papers that often lie in the intersection of quantitative methodology and mathematical sociology.  Two of his theoretical papers appeared early in this journal: “Mathematical Formalization of Durkheim's Theory of Division of Labor” (1970) and “Formal Theory” (1971).  His decades-long research program includes contributions relating to numerous special topics and methods, including [[social statistics]], [[social indicators]], stochastic processes, [[mathematical criminology]], [[demography]] and [[social forecasting]].  Thus Land brings to these fields the skills of a statistician, a mathematician and a sociologist, combined. 
 
(7) [[Affect Control Theory]] and [[David R. Heise]]:  In 1979, Heise published a groundbreaking formal and empirical study in the tradition of interpretive sociology, especially symbolic interactionism,''Understanding Events: Affect and the Construction of Social Action.'' It was the origination of a research program that has included his further theoretical and empirical studies and those of other sociologists, such as  [[Lynn Smith-Lovin]], [[Dawn Robinson]] and [[Neil MacKinnon]]. Definition of the situation and self-other definitions are two of the leading concepts in affect control theory. The formalism used by Heise and other contributors uses a validated form of measurement and a [[cybernetic]] control mechanism in which immediate feelings and compared with fundamental sentiments in such a way as to generate an effort to bring immediate feelings in a situation into correspondence with sentiments. In the simplest models, each person in an interactive pair, is represented in terms of one side of a role relationship in which fundamental sentiments associated with each role guide the process of immediate interaction.  A higher level of the control process can be activated in which the definition of the situation is transformed. This research program comprises several of the key chapters in a  2006 volume&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McClelland |first1=Kent |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas |title=Purpose, Meaning and Action: Control Systems Theories in Sociology |date=2006 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York, N.Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt; of contributions to control systems theory (in the sense of Powers 1975 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Powers |first1=William |title=Behavior: The Control of Perception |date=1975 |publisher=Aldine |location=Chicago, IL.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in sociology.
 
(8) "Distributive Justice Theory" and [[Guillermina Jasso]]: Since 1980, Jasso has treated problems of distributive justice with an original theory that uses mathematical methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jasso |first1=Guillermina |title=A new theory of distributive justice |journal=American Sociological Review |date=1980 |volume=45 |pages=3-32}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has elaborated upon and applied this theory to a wide range of social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jasso |first1=Guillermina |title=Curriculum Vitae 2018 |url=http://legacy.iza.org/en/webcontent/personnel/vitae/jasso_cv.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her most general mathematical apparatus – with the theory of distributive justice as a special case -- deals with any subjective comparison between some actual state and some reference level for it, e.g., a comparison of an actual reward with an expected reward.  In her justice theory, she starts with a very simple premise, the justice evaluation function (the natural logarithm of the ratio of actual to just reward) and then derives numerous empirically testable implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jasso |first1=Gullermina |title=Seven secrets of doing theory |journal=New Directions in Contemporary Sociological Theory edited by J Berger and M Zelditch Jr |date=2002 |pages=317-342}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
(9) Collaborative research and John Skvoretz. A major feature of modern science is collaborative research in which the distinctive skills of the participants combine to produce original research.  Skvoretz, in addition to this other contributions, has been a frequent collaborator in a variety of theoretical research programs, often using mathematical expertise as well as skills in experimental design, statistical data analysis and simulation methods.  Some examples are: (1) Collaborative work on theoretical, statistical and mathematical problems in biased net theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |last3=Agneessens |first3=F |title=Advances in biased net theory:Definitions, derivations, and estimations |journal=Social Networks |date=2004 |volume=26 |pages=113-139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (2) Collaborative contributions to Expectation States Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |title=Status and participation in task groups: A dynamic network model |journal=American Journal of Sociology |date=1996 |volume=101 |pages=1366-1414}}&lt;/ref&gt; (3) Collaborative contributions to [[Elementary Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |last2=Willer |first2=Dave |title=Exclusion and power: a test of four theories of power in exchange networks |journal=American Sociological Review |date=1993 |volume=58 |pages=801-818}}&lt;/ref&gt; (4) Collaboration with [[Bruce Mayhew]] in a structuralist research program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |last2=Mayhew |first2=Bruce |title=The structure of stratified systems and the structure of mobility: a first approximation to a structural theory of vertical mobility |journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology |date=1988 |volume=13 |pages=193-242}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 1970s, Skvoretz has been one of the most prolific of contributors to the advance of mathematical sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |title=Looking backwards into the future: Mathematical sociology then and now |journal=Sociological Theory |date=2000 |volume=18 |pages=510-517}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The above discussion could be expanded to include many other programs and individuals including European sociologists such as [[Peter Abell]] and the late [[Raymond Boudon]].

==Texts and journals==
Mathematical sociology textbooks cover a variety of models, usually explaining the required mathematical background before discussing important work in the literature (Fararo 1973, Leik and Meeker 1975, Bonacich and Lu 2012). An earlier text by [[Otomar Bartos]] (1967) is still of relevance. Of wider scope and mathematical sophistication is the text by Rapoport (1983).  A very reader-friendly and imaginative introduction to explanatory thinking leading to models is Lave and March (1975, reprinted 1993). The ''Journal of Mathematical Sociology'' (started in 1971) has been open to papers covering a broad spectrum of topics employing a variety of types of mathematics, especially through frequent special issues. Other journals in sociology who publish papers with substantial use of mathematics are [https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10588 Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory], [https://www.cmu.edu/joss/index.html Journal of social structure], [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/JASSS.html Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation] 

Articles in ''Social Networks,'' a journal devoted to social structural analysis, very often employ mathematical models and related structural data analyses.  In addition – importantly indicating the penetration of mathematical model building into sociological research – the major comprehensive journals in sociology, especially ''The American Journal of Sociology'' and ''The American Sociological Review,'' regularly publish articles featuring mathematical formulations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29782">'''Modernization theory''' is used to explain the process of modernization within societies. Modernization refers to a model of a progressive transition from a 'pre-modern' or '[[Traditional society|traditional]]' to a 'modern' society. Modernization theory originated from the ideas of German sociologist [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920), which provided the basis for the modernization paradigm developed by Harvard sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] (1902–1979). The theory looks at the internal factors of a country while assuming that with assistance, "traditional" countries can be brought to development in the same manner more developed countries have been. Modernization theory was a dominant paradigm in the social sciences in the 1950s and 1960s, then went into a deep eclipse.  It made a comeback after 1991 but remains a controversial model.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Knobl, "Theories That Won’t Pass Away: The Never-ending Story." in  Gerard Delanty, Engin F. Isin, eds. ''Handbook of Historical Sociology'' (2003): 96–107 esp p. 97 [http://193.231.20.29/seminarii/locuire/Upload/syllabus09/C09b.%20Knobl%20(2003).pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Modernization theory both attempts to identify the social variables that contribute to [[social progress]] and development of societies and seeks to explain the process of [[social evolution]]. Modernization theory is subject to criticism originating among socialist and free-market ideologies, [[world-systems theory|world-systems]] theorists, [[globalization]] theorists and [[dependency theory|dependency]] theorists among others. Modernization theory stresses not only the process of change but also the responses to that change. It also looks at internal dynamics while referring to social and cultural structures and the adaptation of new technologies.
Modernization theory maintains that traditional societies will develop as they adopt more modern practices. Proponents of modernization theory claim that modern states are wealthier and more powerful and that their citizens are freer to enjoy a higher standard of living. Developments such as new data technology and the need to update traditional methods in transport, communication and production, it is argued, make modernization necessary or at least preferable to the status quo. That view makes critique of modern difficult since it implies that such developments control the limits of human interaction, not vice versa. It also implies that human agency controls the speed and severity of modernization. Supposedly, instead of being dominated by tradition, societies undergoing the process of modernization typically arrive at forms of governance dictated by abstract principles. Traditional religious beliefs and cultural traits, according to the theory, usually become less important as modernization takes hold.&lt;ref name="HttpwwwbritannicacomEBcheckedtopicmodernization"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/387301/modernization modernization Encyclopædia Britannica]. Britannica.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians link modernization to the processes of [[urbanization]] and [[industrialization]] and the spread of education. As Kendall (2007) notes, "Urbanization accompanied modernization and the rapid process of industrialization."&lt;ref&gt;Diana Kendall, ''Sociology in Our Times'' (2007) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In [[sociological]] [[critical theory]], modernization is linked to an overarching process of [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]]. When modernization increases within a society, the individual becomes increasingly important, eventually replacing the family or community as the fundamental unit of society.

==Origins==
Sociological theories of the late 19th century such as [[Social Darwinism]] provided a basis for asking what were the laws of evolution of human society.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Henry. "Modernization theory and the sociological study of development" ''Journal of Development Studies'' 7#2 (1971): 141–60.&lt;/ref&gt; The current modernization theory originated with the ideas  of German sociologist [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) regarding the role of rationality and irrationality in the transition from traditional to modern society. Weber's approach provided the basis for the modernization paradigm as popularized by Harvard sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] (1902–1979), who translated Weber's works into English in the 1930s and provided his own interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremiah I. Dibua|title=Modernization and the Crisis of Development in Africa: The Nigerian Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eRLBjz2pWQMC&amp;pg=PA20|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate|pages=20–22|isbn=9780754642282}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leon H. Mayhew, ed., ''Talcott Parsons on institutions and social evolution: selected writings'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1945 the Parsonian version became widely used in sociology and other social sciences.  By the late 1960s opposition developed because the theory was too general and did not fit all societies in quite the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Dean C. Tipps, "Modernization theory and the comparative study of national societies: A critical perspective." ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 15#2 (1973): 199–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Globalization and modernization ==
[[Globalization]] can be defined as the integration of economic, political and social cultures. It is argued that globalization is related to the spreading of modernization across borders.

Global trade has grown continuously since the European discovery of new continents in the [[Early modern period]]; it increased particularly as a result of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the mid-20th century adoption of the [[shipping container]].

Annual trans-border tourist arrivals rose to 456 million by 1990 and almost tripled since, reaching a total of over 1.2 billion in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;(Knowles, 1994: FT,7 January 1997: V11)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.unwto.org/press-release/2017-01-17/sustained-growth-international-tourism-despite-challenges|title=Sustained growth in international tourism despite challenges {{!}} World Tourism Organization UNWTO|website=www2.unwto.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communication is another major area that has grown due to modernization. Communication industries have enabled capitalism to spread throughout the world. Telephony, television broadcasts, news services and online service providers have played a crucial part in globalization. Former U.S president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was a supporter of the modernization theory and believed that television had potential to provide educational tools in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindo-Fuentes|first=Héctor|date=2009|title=Educational Television in El Salvador and Modernisation Theory|jstor=27744205|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies|volume=41|issue=4|pages=757–792|doi=10.2307/27744205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the many apparent positive attributes to globalization there are also negative consequences. The dominant, neoliberal model of globalization often increases disparities between a society's rich and its poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/feminism-globalization/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Parekh|first=Serena|last2=Wilcox|first2=Shelley|date=2014-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} In major cities of developing countries there exist pockets where technologies of the modernised world, computers, cell phones and satellite television, exist alongside stark poverty. Globalists are globalization modernization theorists and argue that globalization is positive for everyone, as its benefits must eventually extend to all members of society, including vulnerable groups such as women and children.

== Democratization and modernization ==
The relationship between modernization and democracy is one of the most researched studies in comparative politics. There is academic debate over the drivers of democracy because there are theories that support economic growth as both a cause and effect of the institution of democracy. “Lipset’s observation that democracy is related to economic development, first advanced in 1959, has generated the largest body of research on any topic in comparative politics,” (Przeworski and Limongi, 1997).

Larry Diamond and Juan Linz, who worked with Lipset in the book, ''Democracy in Developing Countries: Latin America'', argue that economic performance affects the development of democracy in at least three ways. First, they argue that economic growth is more important for democracy than given levels of socioeconomic development. Second, socioeconomic development generates social changes that can potentially facilitate democratization. Third, socioeconomic development promotes other changes, like organization of the middle class, which is conducive to democracy.&lt;ref&gt;(Democracy in Developing Countries: Latin America, pp 44-46)&lt;/ref&gt;

As Seymour Martin Lipset put it, "All the various aspects of economic development — industrialization, urbanization, wealth and education — are so closely interrelated as to form one major factor which has the political correlate of democracy".&lt;ref&gt;Seymour Martin Lipset, ''Political Man'' (1963), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The argument also appears in Walt W. Rostow, ''Politics and the Stages of Growth'' (1971); A. F. K. Organski, ''The Stages of Political Development'' (1965); and David Apter, ''The Politics of Modernization'' (1965). In the 1960s, some critics argued that the link between modernization and democracy was based too much on the example of European history and neglected the [[Third World]].&lt;ref&gt;Andre Gunder Frank, ''Latin America: Underdevelopment or Revolution'' (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Recent demonstrations of the emergence of democracy in [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[South Africa]] have been cited as support for Lipset's thesis.

One historical problem with that argument has always been [[German Empire|Germany]] whose economic modernization in the 19th century came long before the democratization after 1918. Berman, however, concludes that a process of democratization was underway in Imperial Germany, for "during these years Germans developed many of the habits and mores that are now thought by political scientists to augur healthy political development".&lt;ref&gt;Sheri E. Berman, "Modernization in Historical Perspective: The Case of Imperial Germany,"  ''World Politics'' v.53#3 (2001) 431–62 quote at p. 456&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Christian Welzel]] (2009) contend that the realization of democracy is not based solely on an expressed desire for that form of government, but democracies are born as a result of the admixture of certain social and cultural factors. They argue the ideal social and cultural conditions for the foundation of a democracy are born of significant modernization and economic development that result in mass political participation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Inglehart]] and [[Christian Welzel]], "How Development Leads to Democracy," ''Foreign Affairs'' Mar/Apr2009, Vol. 88 Issue 2, pp. 33–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Peerenboom (2008) explores the relationships among democracy, the rule of law and their relationship to wealth by pointing to examples of Asian countries, such as Taiwan and South Korea, which have successfully democratized only after economic growth reached relatively high levels and to examples of countries such as the [[Philippines]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]], [[Indonesia]] and [[India]], which sought to democratize at lower levels of wealth but have not done as well.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Peerenboom, ''China Modernizes: Threat to the West or Model for the Rest?'' (2008) p, 63. He suggests [[China]] will grant democratic rights when it is as modern and as rich as the West per capita.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam Przeworski]] and others have challenged Lipset's argument. They say political regimes do not transition to democracy as per capita incomes rise. Rather, democratic transitions occur randomly, but once there, countries with higher levels of gross domestic product per capita remain democratic. Epstein et al. (2006) retest the modernization hypothesis using new data, new techniques, and a three-way, rather than dichotomous, classification of regimes. Contrary to Przeworski, this study finds that the modernization hypothesis stands up well. Partial democracies emerge as among the most important and least understood regime types.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Epstein, et al., "Democratic Transitions," ''American Journal of Political Science'' 2006 50(3): 551–69&lt;/ref&gt;

Highly contentious is the idea that modernization implies more human rights, with China in the 21st century being a major test case.

==Technology==
New [[technology]] is a major source of social change. (Social change refers to any significant alteration over time in behavior patterns and cultural values and norms.) Since modernization entails the social transformation from agrarian societies to industrial ones, it is important to look at the technological viewpoint; however, new technologies do not change societies by itself. Rather, it is the ''response'' to technology that causes change. Frequently, technology is recognized but not put to use for a very long time such as the ability to extract metal from rock.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Although that initially went unused, it later had profound implications for the developmental course of societies. Technology makes it possible for a more innovated society and broad social change. That dramatic change through the centuries that has evolved socially, industrially, and economically, can be summed up by the term modernization. Cell phones, for example, have changed the lives of millions throughout the world. That is especially true in [[Africa]] and other parts of the [[Middle East]], where there is a low cost communication infrastructure. With cell phone technology, widely dispersed populations are connected, which facilitates business-to-business communication and provides internet access to remoter areas, with a consequential rise in literacy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Development and modernization==
Development, like modernization, has become the orienting principle of modern times. Countries that are seen as modern are also seen as developed, which means that they are generally more respected by institutions such as the [[United Nations]] and even as possible trade partners for other countries. The extent to which a country has modernized or developed dictates its power and importance on the international level.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Modernization of the health sector of developing nations recognizes that transitioning from '[[traditional]]' to 'modern' is not merely the advancement in technology and the introduction of Western practices; implementing modern healthcare requires the reorganization of political agenda and, in turn, an increase in funding by feeders and resources towards public health. However, rather than replicating the stages of developed nations, whose roots of modernization are found with the context of [[industrialization]] or [[colonialism]], underdeveloped nations should apply proximal interventions to target rural communities and focus on prevention strategies rather than curative solutions. That has been successfully exhibited by the Christian Medical Commission and in China through '[[barefoot doctors]]'. Additionally, a strong advocate of the DE-emphasis of medical institutions was [[Halfdan T. Mahler]], the [[WHO]] General Director from 1973 to 1988. Related ideas have been proposed at international conferences such as [[Alma Alta Declaration|Alma-Ats]] and the "Health and Population in Development" conference, sponsored by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] in [[Italy]] in 1979, and selective primary healthcare and [[GOBI-FFF|GOBI]] were discussed (although they have both been strongly criticized by supporters of comprehensive healthcare). Overall, however, this is not to say that the nations of the Global South can function independently from Western states; significant funding is received from well-intention programs, foundations, and charities that target epidemics such as [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]], and [[tuberculosis]] that have substantially improved the lives of millions of people and impeded future development.&lt;ref&gt;Cueto, Marcos. 2004. The ORIGINS of Primary Health Care and SELECTIVE Primary Health Care. Am J Public Health 94 (11):1864–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernization theorists often saw traditions as obstacles to economic growth. According to Seymour Martin Lipset, economic conditions are heavily determined by the cultural, social values present in that given society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Elites in Latin America|last=Lipset|first=Seymour Martin|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1967|isbn=|location=New York|page=3|chapter=Chapter 1: Values, Education, and Entrepreneurship}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, while modernization might deliver violent, radical change for [[traditional society|traditional societies]], it was thought worth the price. Critics insist that traditional societies were often destroyed without ever gaining the promised advantages if, among other things, the economic gap between advanced societies and such societies actually increased. The net effect of modernization for some societies was therefore the replacement of traditional poverty by a more modern form of [[wikt:misery|misery]], according to these critics.&lt;ref&gt;Majid Rahnema, ''Quand la misère chasse la pauvreté'', Arles: Actes Sud 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Others point to improvements in living standards, physical infrastructure, education and economic opportunity to refute such criticisms.

==Criticism==
From the 1960s, modernization theory has been criticized by numerous scholars, including  [[Andre Gunder Frank]] (1929 – 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Sing Chew and Pat Lauderdale, eds. ''Theory and methodology of world development: The writings of Andre Gunder Frank'' (Springer, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] (born 1930).&lt;ref&gt;Theda Skocpol, "Wallerstein's world capitalist system: a theoretical and historical critique." ''American Journal of Sociology'' (1977) 82#5 pp. 1075–90 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2777814 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the modernization of a society required the destruction of the indigenous culture and its replacement by a more Westernized one. By one definition, ''modern'' simply refers to the present, and any society still in existence is therefore modern. Proponents of modernization typically view only Western society as being truly modern and argue that others are primitive or unevolved by comparison. That view sees unmodernized societies as inferior even if they have the same standard of living as western societies. Opponents argue that modernity is independent of culture and can be adapted to any society. Japan is cited as an example by both sides. Some see it as proof that a thoroughly modern way of life can exist in a non western society. Others argue that [[Japan]] has become distinctly more western as a result of its modernization.

As Tipps has argued, by conflating modernization with other processes, with which theorists use interchangeably (democratization, liberalization, development), the term becomes imprecise and therefore difficult to disprove.&lt;ref&gt;Dean C. Tipps, "Modernization theory and the comparative study of national societies: A critical perspective." ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 15#2 (1973): 199–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory has also been criticised empirically, as modernization theorists ignore external sources of change in societies. The binary between traditional and modern is unhelpful, as the two are linked and often interdependent, and 'modernization' does not come as a whole.

Modernization theory has also been accused of being [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]], as modernization began in Europe, with the [[Industrial Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Revolutions of 1848]] (Macionis 953) and has long been regarded as reaching its most advanced stage in Europe. Anthropologists typically make their criticism one step further and say that the view is ethnocentric and is specific to [[Western culture]].

===Dependency theory===
One alternative model on the left is [[Dependency theory]]. It emerged in the 1950s and argues that the underdevelopment of poor nations in the Third World derived from systematic imperial and neo-colonial exploitation of raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;Abhijeet Paul, "Dependency theory." in John Mackenzie, ed.   ''The Encyclopedia of Empire'' (2016) {{doi|10.1002/9781118455074.wbeoe242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its proponents argue that resources typically flow from a "periphery" of poor and [[Developing country|underdeveloped states]] to a "core" of [[Developed country|wealthy states]], enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theorists such as [[Andre Gunder Frank]] that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the "[[world system]]".&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Manning, and Barry K.

Dependency models arose from a growing association of southern hemisphere nationalists (from Latin America and Africa) and Marxists.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Smith,  "The underdevelopment of development literature: the case of dependency theory." ''World Politics'' 31#2 (1979): 247–88.&lt;/ref&gt; It was their reaction against modernization theory, which held that all societies progress through similar stages of development, that today's underdeveloped areas are thus in a similar situation to that of today's developed areas at some time in the past, and that, therefore, the task of helping the underdeveloped areas out of poverty is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as investment, technology transfers, and closer integration into the world market. Dependency theory rejected this view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and structures of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Newschool, [http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/schools/develop.htm "Economic Development"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714063027/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/schools/develop.htm |date=2009-07-14 }}, retrieved July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Municipal annexation''' is a process by which a municipality expands its boundaries into adjacent areas not already incorporated into the municipality. This has been a common response of cities to [[urbanization]] in neighboring areas. It may be done because the neighboring urban areas seek municipal services or because a city seeks control over its [[suburb]]s or neighboring unincorporated areas.

In the [[United States]], all local governments are considered "creatures of the state" according to [[John Forrest Dillon#Dillon's Rule|Dillon's Rule]], which resulted from the work of [[John Forrest Dillon]] on the law of [[municipal corporation]]s. Dillon's Rule implies, among other things, that the boundaries of any [[jurisdiction]] falling under state government can be modified by state government action. For this reason, examples of municipal annexation are distinct from [[annexation]]s involving [[sovereign state]]s.

==Unusual annexations==

===Crossing county lines: Atlanta ===
In 1909 the city of [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], then located only in [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]], annexed part of neighboring [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]], from which Fulton County had originally been divided. Because the original county borders retain legal significance, the expansion into two counties generated some problems, such as when police arrest suspects on charges set forth in Georgia [[U.S. state|state]] law and city police must determine to which county's jail they must be taken.

===Merging by referendum: New York===
Following referenda in 1874 and 1895, the [[City of Greater New York|City of New York]] annexed portions of southern [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and in 1898, after another referendum, the city annexed all of [[Brooklyn|Kings]], [[Staten Island|Richmond]], and most of [[Queens]] counties. The annexed portion of Westchester County is now [[The Bronx|Bronx]] county; the unannexed portion of Queens County is now Nassau County.  As a result, Westchester County does not currently include any portion of the City of New York and Queens County is entirely within the City of New York.

==Shoestring annexation==
[[Image:LA in LA County map.png|thumb|right|300 px|A map of [[Los Angeles County]] with the city of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in red, showing the Shoestring Strip annexation, which reaches south to the San Pedro area and the [[Port of Los Angeles]].]]

A "shoestring annexation" is a term used for an annexation by a [[city]], [[town]] or other [[municipality]] in which it acquires new territory that is contiguous to the existing territory but is only connected to it by a thin strip of land.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9vQTxyeb04EC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=Shoestring+annexation&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U0HmVkonY3ZzHjCa3Bca9wN5w9cIg#PPA46,M1 Annexation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zxUVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA363&amp;dq=Shoestring+annexation&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a A History of California and an Extended History of Los Angeles]&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes called a "flagpole annexation" because the territory resembles a flagpole, in which the connection is the "pole" and the annexed territory the "flag".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.state.co.us/owenspress/11-06-01a.htm |title=Flagpole annexation in Colorado |access-date=2010-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020101213353/http://www.state.co.us/owenspress/11-06-01a.htm |archive-date=2002-01-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons===
In some states, municipalities are prohibited from annexing land not directly connected to their existing territory.  A shoestring or flagpole annexation allows the municipality to do so.

Such annexations are sometimes used when a municipality seeks to acquire [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] developed land, such as a newly built [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]] separated from it by undeveloped open space. They may also be used when a municipality desires to annex a commercial or industrial area without taking over intervening residential areas, so as to collect tax revenues from the businesses or industry without having to provide services (such as [[electricity]] and [[waste|garbage]] collection) to residents. Such uses of the technique are often criticized and derided as a form of [[gerrymandering]], and have in fact been used for the purpose of manipulating vote distribution among election precincts and districts.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

A related strategy is called strip annexation, which involves annexing a narrow strip that encloses a large block of unincorporated land. Strip annexation was widely used by the municipalities of the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]] during the 1970s to preemptively gain control of large areas of land before other municipalities, without having to annex more than a thin strip surrounding a large so-called [[county island]]. The strip protected the county island from being annexed by other municipalities, thus giving the strip-annexing municipality the ability to slowly annex portions of the county island over time. One such annexation by [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]] in 1974 spurred nearby [[Gilbert, Arizona|Gilbert]] to create the largest county island to date by annexing a strip no more than 200 feet wide that enclosed 51 square miles of unincorporated [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]]. The annexation was challenged in court and, although found legal, eventually led to legislation in 1980 outlawing strip annexation. Some municipalities rushed to annex before the law took effect, such as [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], which annexed a 10 foot wide strip enclosing an 86 square mile county island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scholarworks.umass.edu/econ_workingpaper/55/ |title= Border Wars: Tax Revenues, Annexation, and Urban Growth in Phoenix |last= Heim |first= Carol E. |publisher= University of Massachusetts Amherst |pages= 18–27, 54 |accessdate= 27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
[[Image:US-IL-Chicago.png|thumb|right|300 px|A map of the city of [[Chicago]] showing the connection into [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]] for O'Hare International Airport.]]
{{norefs|section|date = March 2018}}

===Port of LA===
The [[Port of Los Angeles]] together with the [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]], [[Wilmington, Los Angeles, California|Wilmington]] and [[Harbor City, Los Angeles, California|Harbor City]] neighborhoods of [[Los Angeles]], are connected to the main part of the city by what is called locally the "[[Harbor Gateway, Los Angeles, California|Shoestring Strip]]" between [[Figueroa Street]] and [[Vermont Avenue]] and between [[Western Avenue, Los Angeles, California|Western]] and [[Normandie Avenue|Normandie]] avenues to the south.

===O'Hare Airport===
[[O'Hare Airport]] is municipally connected to the city of [[Chicago]] via a narrow strip of land, approximately 200 feet wide, along Foster Avenue from the [[Des Plaines river]] to the airport. This land was annexed in the 1950s to assure the airport was contiguous with the city to keep it under city control.  The strip is bounded on the north by [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]] and the south by [[Schiller Park, Illinois|Schiller Park]].&lt;ref&gt;http://egov.cityofchicago.org/webportal/COCWebPortal/COC_ATTACH/41st.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allston-Brighton===
The [[Boston]] neighborhoods of [[Allston]] and [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]] were part of an independent town of Brighton before being annexed by Boston.  At the time [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] extended to the [[Charles River]] and separated Boston and Brighton.  As a result, a shoestring annexation was obtained by Boston from Brookline when Brighton joined Boston.  This was made necessary by [[Boston–Brookline annexation debate of 1873|Brookline's refusal to join Boston]] a year before Brighton's annexation.

===South San Diego===
[[South San Diego]], located next to the [[Mexico–United States border]], is physically separated from the rest of [[San Diego]] by the cities of [[National City, California|National City]] and [[Chula Vista]]. A narrow strip of land at the bottom of [[San Diego Bay]] connects these southern neighborhoods with the rest of the city.

It is part of the [[University of Oslo]], but is established by, funded by and receives its assignments directly from the [[Government of Norway|central government]]. Its major focus areas are [[violence]] and [[sexual abuse]]; [[disaster]] management, [[terrorism]], [[armed conflicts]] and [[traumatic stress]]; and [[forced migration]] and [[Migrant health|refugee health]]. 

[[File:Day after Oslo bombing.jpg|thumb|left|upright|NKVTS is involved in major research projects on the psychological and social impact of [[terrorism]], such as the [[2011 Norway attacks]]]]
The centre was established in 2004 through the merger of a part of the former ''Division of Disaster Psychiatry'' (KKP) of the [[Norwegian Armed Forces]] medical service, the former ''Psychosocial Centre for Refugees'' at the University of Oslo (PSSF), the ''Norwegian Resource Centre for Information and Studies on Violence'' (VOS), and the ''Norwegian National Resource Center on Child Sexual Abuse'' (NRSB) at [[Aker University Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Malt |first=Ulrik |author-link= Ulrik Fredrik Malt |editor-last= |editor-first= |editor-link= |encyclopedia= Store medisinske leksikon |title= Nasjonalt kunnskapssenter om vold og traumatisk stress |trans-title= |url= http://sml.snl.no/Nasjonalt_kunnskapssenter_om_vold_og_traumatisk_stress |year= |publisher= |volume= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ullevål universitetssykehus.jpg|thumb|NKVTS was located at [[Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål]] 2004–2013]]
The centre is a joint initiative of the [[Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services|Ministry of Health]], the [[Ministry of Justice and Public Security]], the [[Norwegian Ministry of Defence|Ministry of Defence]], the [[Norwegian Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion|Ministry of Labour]], and the [[Norwegian Ministry of Children, Equality and Social Inclusion|Ministry of Children, Equality and Social Inclusion]], and is funded directly by these government departments while organizationally being part of the [[University of Oslo]]. The centre was located at [[Oslo University Hospital, Ullevål]] 2004–2013, and is now located in [[Nydalen]], [[Oslo]], in the immediate vicinity of the Ministry of Justice and Public Security and of the [[BI Norwegian Business School]].

The centre has 94 employees (2016). It employs experts in [[psychology]], [[medicine]] (including [[psychiatry]] and [[pediatrics]]), [[law]], [[sociology]], [[criminology]], [[social anthropology]] and other disciplines, with the main emphasis on psychology and psychiatry. Its academic staff include 6 [[Academic ranks in Norway#Research professor|research professors]] (corresponding to full professors), 2 research professors II (part-time), 32 senior researchers (corresponding to associate professors), 6 researchers (corresponding to assistant professors) and a number of postdoctoral fellows, research fellows (doctoral candidates) and research assistants. NKVTS cooperates closely with the [[Department of Psychology, University of Oslo|Department of Psychology]], the [[University of Oslo Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine]] and the [[University of Oslo Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]] at the University of Oslo, where several of its research professors also hold professorial chairs.&lt;ref name="Aarsrapport2016" /&gt;

[[Nora Sveaass]], then research director for refugee health and forced migration at NKVTS, was elected as a member of the [[United Nations Committee against Torture]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/norwegian-psychologist-to-sit-on-un-comm/id419790/ Norwegian psychologist to sit on UN Committee against Torture], [[Government of Norway]]&lt;/ref&gt;

NKVTS has major research projects on the psychological and social impact of [[terrorism]], including the [[2011 Norway attacks]]. NKVTS also has several research projects on the psychological impact of natural catastrophes such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], and on [[child soldier]]s in [[Africa]], [[torture]], traumatised refugees, [[war]] victims and [[soldier]]s, [[child sexual abuse]] and [[sexual violence]], and [[Domestic violence|violence in close relations]].

The current Director of the institute is [[Inger Elise Birkeland]], a former political adviser to Prime Minister [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]].

[[B.E. Saunders]] of the [[Medical University of South Carolina]] has described the institute as "one of the most highly respected research organizations in the world dedicated to research on violence and traumatic stress. Since its inception, it has conducted a series of highly sophisticated studies focusing on a wide array of topics, including the prevalence and impact of different forms of violence and abuse among children and adults, mental health treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder and other trauma-related problems, and how best to implement and incorporate evidence-based interventions practices into community service agencies. These studies have had enormous impact not only in Norway, but internationally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nkvts.no/content/uploads/2018/11/Saunders_NKVTS_letter_11-9-18.pdf |title= To Bent Høie |last=Saunders |first=Benjamin E. |date=9 November 2018 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14259">'''Nucleic acid NMR''' is the use of [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] to obtain information about the structure and dynamics of [[nucleic acid]] molecules, such as [[DNA]] or [[RNA]].  It is useful for molecules of up to 100 nucleotides, and as of 2003, nearly half of all known RNA structures had been determined by NMR spectroscopy.&lt;ref name="furtig"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/cbic.200300700 |title=NMR Spectroscopy of RNA |date=2003 |last1=Fürtig |first1=Boris |last2=Richter |first2=Christian |last3=Wöhnert |first3=Jens |last4=Schwalbe |first4=Harald |journal=ChemBioChem |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=936–962 |pmid=14523911}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NMR has advantages over [[X-ray crystallography]], which is the other method for high-resolution [[nucleic acid structure determination]], in that the molecules are being observed in their natural [[solution]] state rather than in a [[crystal lattice]] that may affect the molecule's structural properties.  It is also possible to investigate dynamics with NMR.  This comes at the cost of slightly less accurate and detailed structures than crystallography.&lt;ref name="wemmer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wemmer|first=David|title=Nucleic acids: Structures, Properties, and Functions|date=2000|publisher=University Science Books|location=Sausalito, California|isbn=0-935702-49-0|editor=Bloomfield, Victor A.|editor2=Crothers, Donald M.|editor3=Tinoco, Ignacio |chapter=Chapter 5: Structure and Dynamics by NMR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nucleic acid NMR uses techniques similar to those of [[protein NMR]], but has several differences.  Nucleic acids have a smaller percentage of hydrogen atoms, which are the atoms usually observed in NMR, and because [[Nucleic acid double helix|nucleic acid double helices]] are stiff and roughly linear, they do not fold back on themselves to give "long-range" correlations.  Nucleic acids also tend to have resonances distributed over a smaller range than proteins, making the spectra potentially more crowded and difficult to interpret.&lt;ref name="addess"&gt;{{cite book|last=Addess|first=Kenneth J.|title=Bioorganic Chemistry: Nucleic Acids|date=1996|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn=0-19-508467-5|author2=Feigon, Juli |editor=Hecht, Sidney M.|chapter=Introduction to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR Spectroscopy of DNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experimental methods ==

[[Two-dimensional NMR]] methods are almost always used with nucleic acids.  These include correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and total coherence transfer spectroscopy (TOCSY) to detect through-bond nuclear couplings, and [[nuclear Overhauser effect]] spectroscopy (NOESY) to detect couplings between nuclei that are close to each other in space.  The types of NMR usually done with nucleic acids are [[Proton NMR|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR]], [[Carbon-13 NMR|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR]], [[Nitrogen-15 NMR|&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N NMR]], and [[Phosphorus-31 NMR|&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P NMR]].  [[Fluorine-19 NMR|&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR]] is also useful if nonnatural nucleotides such as [[2'-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine]] are incorporated into the nucleic acid strand, as natural nucleic acids do not contain any fluorine atoms.&lt;ref name="wemmer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kan|first=Lou-sing|title=NMR In Biology and Medicine|date=1986|publisher=Raven Press|location=New York|isbn=0-88167-231-9|author2=Ts'o, Paul O. P.|editor=Chien, Shu |editor2=Ho, Chien|chapter=Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Studies of Nucleic Acids}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P have near 100% [[natural abundance]], while &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N have low natural abundances.  For these latter two nuclei, there is the capability of isotopically enriching desired atoms within the molecules, either uniformly or in a site-specific manner.  Nucleotides uniformly enriched in &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and/or &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N can be obtained through biochemical methods, by performing [[polymerase chain reaction]] using [[Nucleoside triphosphate|dNTPs or NTPs]] derived from bacteria grown in an isotopically enriched environment.  Site-specific isotope enrichment must be done through chemical synthesis of the labeled [[nucleoside phosphoramidite]] monomer and [[oligonucleotide synthesis|of the full strand]]; however these are difficult and expensive to synthesize.&lt;ref name="furtig"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(02)38224-7 |title=Solid-phase synthesis of selectively labeled DNA: Applications for multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy |date=2002 |last1=Kojima |first1=C |last2=Ono |first2=A |last3=Ono |first3=A |last4=Kainosho |first4=M |journal=Methods in Enzymology |volume=338 |pages=261–283 |pmid=11460552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because nucleic acids have a relatively large number of protons which are solvent-exchangeable, nucleic acid NMR is generally not done in [[Heavy water|D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] solvent as is common with other types of NMR.  This is because the [[deuterium]] in the solvent would replace the exchangeable protons and extinguish their signal.  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is used as a solvent, and other methods are used to eliminate the strong solvent signal, such as saturating the solvent signal before the normal pulse sequence ("presaturation"), which works best a low temperature to prevent exchange of the saturated solvent protons with the nucleic acid protons; or exciting only resonances of interest ("selective excitation"), which has the additional, potentially undesired effect of distorting the peak amplitudes.&lt;ref name="wemmer"/&gt;

== Structure determination ==

The exchangeable and non-exchangeable protons are usually assigned to their specific peaks as two independent groups.  For exchangeable protons, which are for the most part the protons involved in [[base pair]]ing, NOESY can be used to find through-space correlations between on neighboring bases, allowing an entire duplex molecule to be assigned through [[sequential walking]].  For nonexchangable protons, many of which are on the sugar moiety of the nucleic acid, COSY and TOCSY are used to identify systems of coupled nuclei, while NOESY is again used to correlate the sugar to the base and each base to its neighboring base.  For duplex DNA nonexchangeable protons the H6/H8 protons on the base correlate to their counterparts on neighboring bases and to the H1' proton on the sugar, allowing sequential walking to be done.  For RNA, the differences in chemical structure and helix geometry make this assignment more technically difficult, but still possible.  The sequential walking methodology is not possible for non-double helical nucleic acid structures, nor for the [[Z-DNA]] form, making assignment of resonances more difficult.&lt;ref name="wemmer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="addess"/&gt;

Parameters taken from the spectrum, mainly NOESY cross-peaks and [[J-coupling|coupling constants]], can be used to determine local structural features such as [[glycosidic bond]] angles, [[dihedral angle]]s (using the [[Karplus equation]]), and sugar pucker conformations.  The presence or absence of imino proton resonances, or of coupling between &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N atoms across a hydrogen bond, indicates the presence or absence of basepairing.  For large-scale structure, these local parameters must be supplemented with other structural assumptions or models, because errors add up as the double helix is traversed, and unlike with proteins, the double helix does not have a compact interior and does not fold back upon itself.  However, long-range orientation information can be obtained through [[residual dipolar coupling]] experiments in a medium which imposes a weak alignment on the nucleic acid molecules.&lt;ref name="furtig"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wemmer"/&gt;

Recently, [[solid-state NMR]] methodology has been introduced for the structure determination of nucleic acids.&lt;ref name="marchanka"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ncomms8024 |title=RNA structure determination by solid-state NMR spectroscopy |date=2015 |last1=Marchanka |first1=Alexander |last2=Simon |first2=Bernd |last3=Althoff-Ospelt |first3=Gerhard |last4=Carlomagno |first4=Teresa |journal=Nature Communications |volume=6 |issue= |pages=7024 |pmid=25960310|bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E7024M |pmc=4432599}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol implies two approaches: nucleotide-type selective labeling of [[RNA]] and usage of heteronuclear correlation experiments.

NMR is also useful for investigating nonstandard geometries such as [[Nucleic acid double helix#Bending|bent helices]], non-Watson–Crick basepairing, and [[coaxial stacking]].  It has been especially useful in probing the structure of natural RNA oligonucleotides, which tend to adopt complex conformations such as [[stem-loop]]s and [[pseudoknot]]s.  Interactions between RNA and metal ions can be probed by a number of methods, including observing changes in chemical shift upon ion binding, observing line broadening for paramagnetic ion species, and observing intermolecular NOE contacts for organometallic mimics of the metal ions.  NMR is also useful for probing the binding of nucleic acid molecules to other molecules, such as proteins or drugs.  This can be done by chemical-shift mapping, which is seeing which resonances are shifted upon binding of the other molecule, or by cross-saturation experiments where one of the binding molecules is selectively saturated and, if bound, the saturation transfers to the other molecule in the complex.&lt;ref name="furtig"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wemmer"/&gt;

Dynamic properties such as duplex–single strand equilibria and binding rates of other molecules to duplexes can also be determined by its effect on the [[spin–lattice relaxation]] time ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, but these methods are insensitive to intermediate rates of 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, which must be investigated with other methods such as [[solid-state NMR]].  Dynamics of mechanical properties of a nucleic acid double helix such as bending and twisting can also be studied using NMR.  [[Pulsed field gradient]] NMR experiments can be used to measure [[diffusion constant]]s.&lt;ref name="furtig"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wemmer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(95)61021-9 |chapter=[19] Site-specific dynamics in DNA: Theory and experiment |title=Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Nucleic Acids |series=Methods in Enzymology |date=1995 |last1=Robinson |first1=B.H. |last2=Drobny |first2=G.P. |isbn=978-0-12-182162-3 |issn=0076-6879 |volume=261 |pages=451–509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Nucleic acid NMR studies were performed as early as 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kearns|first1=David|last2=Patel|first2=Dinshaw|last3=Shulman|first3=Robert|title=High Resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Studies of Hydrogen Bonded Protons of tRNA in Water|journal=Nature|date=1971|volume=229|pages=338–339|doi=10.1038/229338a0|bibcode=1971Natur.229..338K}}&lt;/ref&gt; and focused on using the low-field imino proton resonances to probe base pairing interactions. These early studies focussed on tRNA because these nucleic acids were the only samples available at that time with low enough molecular weight that the NMR spectral line-widths were practical. The study focussed on the low-field protons because they were the only protons that could be reliably observed in aqueous solution using the best spectrometers available at that time. It was quickly realized that spectra of the low-field imino protons were providing clues to the tertiary structure of tRNA in solution. The first NMR spectrum of a double-helical DNA was published in 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Early|first1=Thomas|last2=Kearns|first2=David|last3=Burd|first3=John|last4=Larson|first4=Jacquelynn|last5=Wells|first5=Robert|title=High resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance investigation of the structural and dynamic properties of d(C15A15)·d(T15G15)|journal=Biochemistry|date=1977|volume=16|issue=3|pages=541–551|doi=10.1021/bi00622a031}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a synthetic, 30-base-pair double helix. To overcome sever line-broadening in native DNA, sheer-degraded natural DNA was prepared and studied to learn about the persistence length of double-helical DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Early|first1=Thomas|last2=Kearns|first2=David|title=1H nuclear magnetic resonance investigation of flexibility in DNA|journal=PNAS|date=1979|volume=76|issue=9|pages=4165–4169|pmid=291958|bibcode=1979PNAS...76.4165E|doi=10.1073/pnas.76.9.4165|pmc=411531}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, nucleosome core particles were studied to gain further insight of the flexibility of the double helix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feigon|first1=Juli|last2=Kearns|first2=David|title=1H NMR investigation of the conformational states of DNA in nucleosome core particles|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=1979|volume=6|pages=2327–2337|doi=10.1093/nar/6.6.2327|pmid=461191|pmc=327853}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first NMR spectra reported for a uniform low molecular weight native-sequence DNA, made with [[restriction enzymes]], was reported 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Early|first1=Thomas|last2=Kearns|first2=David|last3=Hillen|first3=Wolfgang|last4=Wells|first4=Robert|title=A 300 MHz and 600 MHz proton NMR study of a 12 base pair restriction fragment: investigation of structure by relaxation measurements.|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=1980|volume=8|pages=5795–5812|doi=10.1093/nar/8.23.5795|pmid=6258152|pmc=324342}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was also the first report of nucleic acid NMR spectra obtained at high field. Two dimensional NMR studies began to be reported in 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feigon|first1=Juli|last2=Wright|first2=John|last3=Leupin|first3=Werner|last4=Denny|first4=WA|last5=Kearns|first5=David|title=Use of two-dimensional NMR in the study of a double-stranded DNA|journal=J.

Soc.|date=1982|volume=104|issue=20|pages=5540–5541|doi=10.1021/ja00384a069}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then, with the advent of [[oligonucleotide synthesis]] and more sophisticated instrumentation, many detailed structural studies were reported starting in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Address, Kenneth|author2=Feigon, Juli|editor1-last=Hecht|editor1-first=Sidney|title=Bioorganic Chemistry: Nucleic Acids|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-508467-5|chapter=Introduction to 1H NMR Spectroscopy of DNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Object Process Methodology''' ('''OPM''') is a conceptual [[modeling language]] and [[methodology]] for [[Knowledge capture|capturing knowledge]] and [[Systems design|designing systems]], specified as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[Publicly Available Specification|PAS]] 19450.&lt;ref name="ISO19450"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/62274.html |title=ISO/PAS 19450:2015 - Automation systems and integration -- Object-Process Methodology |website=iso.org |date=December 2015 |accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a minimal universal [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] of [[stateful]] [[Object (computer science)|object]]s and [[Process theory|process]]es that transform them, OPM can be used to formally specify the function, structure, and behavior of artificial and natural systems in a large variety of domains.

OPM was conceived and developed by [[Dov Dori]]. The ideas underlying OPM were published for the first time in 1995.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dori|first=Dov|authorlink=Dov Dori|title=Object-Process Analysis: Maintaining the Balance between System Structure and Behavior|journal=[[Journal of Logic and Computation]]|date=1995|volume=5|issue=2|pages=227–249|doi=10.1093/logcom/5.2.227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, OPM has evolved and developed.

In 2002, the first book on OPM&lt;ref name="Object-Process Methodology – A Holistic Systems Paradigm"/&gt; was published, and on December 15, 2015, after six years of work by ISO TC184/SC5, [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] adopted OPM as ISO/PAS 19450.&lt;ref name="ISO19450" /&gt; A second book on OPM was published in 2016.&lt;ref name="Model-Based"/&gt;

== Overview ==
Object Process Methodology (OPM) is a conceptual modeling language and methodology for capturing knowledge and designing systems. Based on a minimal universal [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] of [[stateful]] [[Object (computer science)|object]]s and [[Process theory|process]]es that transform them, OPM can be used to formally specify the function, structure, and behavior of artificial and natural systems in a large variety of domains. Catering to human cognitive abilities, an OPM model represents the system under design or study bimodally in both graphics and text for improved representation, understanding, communication, and learning.

In OPM, an ''object'' is a thing that exists, or might exist, physically or informatically. Objects are [[stateful]]—they may have states, such that at each point in time, the object is at one of its states or in transition between states. A ''process'' is a thing that transforms an object by creating or consuming it, or by changing its state.

OPM is bimodal; it is expressed both visually/graphically in Object-Process Diagrams (OPD) and verbally/textually in Object-Process Language (OPL), a set of automatically-generated sentences in a subset of English. A software package called OPCAT, for generating OPD and OPL, is freely available.&lt;ref name="OPCAT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://esml.iem.technion.ac.il/opcat-installation/ |title=Enterprise Systems Modeling Laboratory » OPCAT installation |website=technion.ac.il |accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The shift to the [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] (OO) paradigm for computer [[programming language]]s, which occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, was followed by the idea that programming should be preceded by [[object-oriented analysis and design]] of the programs, and, more generally, the systems those programs represent and serve. Thus, in the early 1990s, over 30 object-oriented analysis and design methods and notations flourished, leading to what was known as the "methods war".&lt;ref&gt;Booch, G. "Time for a ceasefire in the methods war". ''Journal of Object-Oriented Programming'', July/August 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around that time, in 1991, [[Dov Dori]], who then joined [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology]] as faculty, realized that just as the procedural approach to software was not necessarily the most adequate one, neither was the "pure" OO approach, which puts objects as the sole "first class" citizens, with "methods" (or "services", or "operations") being their second-class subordinate procedures.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} When he and colleagues from [[University of Washington]] were trying to model a system for automated transforming of [[engineering drawing]]s to [[CAD model]]s, he realized that not all the boxes in their model were really objects; some were things that happen to objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dori |first1=Dov |last2=Tombre |first2=Karl |title=From engineering drawings to 3D CAD models: are we ready now? |journal=Computer-Aided Design |date=1995 |volume=27 |pages=243-254 |url=http://dori2.technion.ac.il/opm/documents/articles/article172.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he circled those things, a bipartite graph emerged, in which the nodes representing objects—the things that exist—were mediated by those circled nodes, which were identified as processes—the things that transform the objects. Dori published the first paper on OPM in 1995.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1997, the "methods war" culminated in the adoption of the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), by the [[Object Management Group]] (OMG), making it the de facto standard for software design. UML 1.1 was submitted to the OMG in August 1997 and adopted by the OMG in November 1997.

UML 1.X had nine types of diagrams. Following a 2001 initiative of the [[International Council on Systems Engineering]] (INCOSE), in 2003 OMG issued the UML for Systems Engineering Request for Proposals, and in 2006 OMG adopted SysML ([[Systems Modeling Language]]) 1.0 specification, which is based on UML 2. Since then, SysML has become the de facto standard for systems engineering.

The first book on OPM, ''Object-Process Methodology: a Holistic Systems Paradigm'', was published in 2002,&lt;ref name="Object-Process Methodology – A Holistic Systems Paradigm"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dori |first=Dov |authorlink=Dov Dori |title=Object-Process Methodology: A Holistic Systems Paradigm |date=2002 |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |location=Berlin, Heidelberg, New York |isbn=3540654712 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-56209-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and OPM has since been applied in many domains, ranging from the [[Semantic Web]] to defense and to molecular biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Perelman |first1=Valeria |last2=Somekh |first2=Judith |last3=Dori |first3=Dov |title=Model verification framework with application to molecular biology |date=2011 |publisher=Society for Computer Simulation International |pages=140-145 |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2048494 |ref=MolecularBiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recognition that models can and should become the central artifact in system lifecycles has been gaining momentum in recent years, giving rise to [[model-based systems engineering]] (MBSE) as an evolving field in the area of systems engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fischer |first1=Amit |last2=Nolan |first2=Mike |last3=Friedenthal |first3=Sanford |last4=Loeffler |first4=Michael |last5=Sampson |first5=Mark |last6=Bajaj |first6=Manas |last7=VanZandt |first7=Lonnie |last8=Hovey |first8=Krista |last9=Palmer |first9=John |last10=Hart |first10=Laura |title=3.1.1 Model Lifecycle Management for MBSE |journal=INCOSE International Symposium |date=2014 |volume=24 |doi=10.1002/j.2334-5837.2014.tb03145.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SysML and OPM have been serving as the two MBSE languages, but since SysML was adopted as a standard about eight years before OPM and has been backed by top-notch vendors, its adoption is currently more widespread. However, OPM is rapidly gaining acceptance in academia and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beier |first1=Grischa |last2=Figge |first2=Asmus |last3=Marwedel |first3=Stephan |title=A MBSE Approach for the Development of Complex Technical Systems |journal=Internnational Journal of Engineering Research and Applications (IJERA) |date=2017 |volume=7 |issue=9 |pages=24-36 |doi=10.9790/9622-0709052436 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321193816_A_MBSE_Approach_for_the_Development_of_Complex_Technical_Systems |ref=industryusage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, after five years of work by ISO TC184/SC5, ISO adopted OPM as ISO/PAS 19450.&lt;ref name="ISO19450" /&gt;

A second book on OPM, which also covers SysML, was published in 2016.&lt;ref name="Model-Based"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dori |first=Dov |authorlink=Dov Dori |title=Model-Based Systems Engineering with OPM and SysML |date=2016 |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |location=New York |isbn=9781493932955 |oclc=959032986 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-3295-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Opm methodology phases.png|alt=Opm methodology phases|thumb|OPM methodology phases]]
Object-Process Methodology (OPM) is a systems modeling paradigm that integrates two aspects inherent in any system: its structure and its behavior. Structure is represented via objects and structural relations among them, such as aggregation-participation (whole-part relation) and generalization-specialization ("is-a" relation). Behavior is represented by processes and how they transform objects: How they create or consume objects, or how they change the states of an object. Indeed, OPM is fundamentally simple; it builds on a minimal set of concepts: stateful objects—things that exist or might exist physically or informatically at some state, and processes—things that happen to objects and transform them by creating or consuming the objects or by changing their states.&lt;ref name="Model-Based"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

OPM offers a way to model systems of almost any domain, be it artificial or natural. OPM has an [[ontological commitment]] to a universal minimal ontology according to which objects exist, while processes transform them.&lt;ref name="Model-Based"/&gt;{{rp|x}}&lt;ref&gt;See also: {{cite journal |last1=Herre |first1=Heinrich |last2=Heller |first2=Barbara |last3=Burek |first3=Patryk |last4=Hoehndorf |first4=Robert |last5=Loebe |first5=Frank |last6=Michalek |first6=Hannes |date=July 2006 |title=General formal ontology (GFO): a foundational ontology integrating objects and processes: part I: basic principles |journal=Onto-Med Report |volume=8 |page=3 |url=http://www.onto-med.de/publications/2006/herre-h-2006-a.pdf |quote=Current languages in use for conceptual modeling like the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), [[entity–relationship model]]ing in the database field, or the Object-Process Methodology can be examined according to their ontological commitments.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transformation includes object creation and consumption, as well as change of the state of an object. Hence, stateful objects and processes that transform them are the only two concepts in OPM's universal minimal ontology. Two other cornerstones of OPM are its bi-modal graphical-textual representation and its built-in refinement-abstraction [[complexity management]] mechanisms of in-zooming and unfolding of a single type of diagram—Object-Process Diagram (OPD).

===Modeling===
OPM represents the system model simultaneously in two different modalities: Object Process Diagramׂs (OPD) and a corresponding set of sentences in a subset of English, called Object Process Language (OPL). OPL is generated automatically by OPCAT,&lt;ref name="OPCAT"/&gt; a software tool that supports modeling in OPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dori|first1=Dov|last2=Linchevski|first2=Chen|last3=Manor|first3=Raanan|title=OPCAT – A Software Environment for Object-Process Methodology Based Conceptual Modelling of Complex Systems|journal=Proc. 1st International Conference on Modelling and Management of Engineering Processes|date=2010|volume=University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK, Heisig, P., Clarkson, J., and Vajna, S. (Eds.)|pages=147–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Object Process Diagram (OPD)
OPD is the one and only kind of diagram of OPM. This uniqueness of diagram kind is a major contributor to OPM's simplicity, and it is in sharp contrast to UML, which has 14 kinds of diagrams, and to SysML, which has nine such kinds.&lt;ref name="SysMLvsOPM"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grobshtein |first1=Yariv |last2=Perelman |first2=Valeriya |last3=Safra |first3=Eliyahu |last4=Dori |first4=Dov |title=Systems Modeling Languages: OPM Versus SysML |date=2007 |publisher=IEEE |location=Haifa, Israel |isbn=1-4244-0770-2 |pages=102-109 |url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4243724/authors#authors |accessdate=15 November 2018 |ref=SysMLvsOPM}}&lt;/ref&gt; An OPD graphically describes objects, processes and links among them. Links can be structural and procedural. Structural links connect objects to objects or processes to processes, expressing the static system aspect—how the system is structured. Procedural links connect objects to processes, expressing the dynamic system aspect—how the system changes over time. The entire system is represented by a set of hierarchically-organized OPDs, such that the root OPD, called the systems diagram (SD), specifies the "bird's eye" view of the system, and lower-level OPDs specify the system in increasing levels of detail. All the OPDs in the system's OPD set are "aware" of each other, with each showing the system, or part of it, at some level of detail. The entire system is specified in its entirety by the union of the details model facts) appearing in all the OPDs.

; Object Process Language (OPL)
Each OPD construct (i.e., two or more things connected by one or more link) is translated to a sentence in OPL—a subset of natural English. The power of OPL lies in the fact that it is readable by humans but also interpretable by computers. Since each model fact is expressed both graphically and textually, in a subset of natural English, it is readily accessible to non-technical stakeholders, enabling them to take part in the early, critical stages of the system requirements elicitation, architecting and development. These are the stages where the most important design decisions are made. The graphics-text bimodality of OPM makes it suitable to jointly model requirements by a team that involves both the customer or his domain expert on one hand, and the system architect, modelers, and designers on the other hand.&lt;ref name="Model-Based"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

; OPM model animated simulation
OPM models are not just static graphical and textual representations of the system—they are also executable. A correct OPM model constructed in OPCAT can be simulated by animating it, visually expressing how the system behaves over time to achieve its function at all detail levels. An incorrect OPM model will not execute all the way through, and will indicate where and why it is stuck, effectively serving as a visual debugger.

===Development===
In his forward to Dori's book ''Model-Based Systems Engineering with OPM and SysML'', [[Edward F. Crawley]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;OPM semantics was originally geared towards systems engineering, as it can model information, hardware, people, and regulation. However, in recent years OPM started to serve also researchers in molecular biology, yielding new published findings related to the mRNA lifecycle. This is a clear indication of the universality of the object-and-process ontology.&lt;ref name="Model-Based"/&gt;{{rp|vi}}&lt;ref&gt;See also: {{cite web |url=http://esml.iem.technion.ac.il/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Supplement-1.pdf |title=The mRNA Lifecycle |website=technion.ac.il |accessdate=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Basics==
[[File:OPMEntities.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM entities: object, object state and process]]
OPM has two main parts: the language and the methodology. The language is bimodal—it is expressed in two complementary ways (modalities): the visual, graphical part—a set of one or more Object-Process Diagrams (OPDs), and a corresponding textual part—a set of sentences in Object-Process Language (OPL), which is a subset of English.

The top-level OPD is the system diagram (SD), which provides the context for the system's function. For man-made systems this function is expected to benefit a person or a group of people—the beneficiary. The function is the main process in SD, which also contains the objects involved in this process: the beneficiary, the operand (the object upon which the process operates), and possibly the attribute whose value the process changes.

OPM graphical elements are divided into entities, expressed as closed shapes, and relations, expressed as links that connect entities.

===Entities===
Entities are the building blocks of OPM. They include objects and processes, collectively called things, and object states.
; Object : An object is a thing, which once constructed, exists or can exist physically or informatically. Associations among objects constitute the object structure of the system being modeled. In OPL text, the object name shall appear in bold face with capitalization of each word.
; Object state : An object state is a particular situation classification of an object at some point during its lifetime. At every point in time, the object is in one of its states or in transition between two of its states—from its input state to its output state.
; Process : A process is an expression of the pattern of transformation of objects in the system. A process does not exist in isolation; it is always associated with and occurs or happens to one or more objects. A process transforms objects by creating them, consuming them, or changing their state. Thus, processes complement objects by providing the dynamic, behavioral aspect of the system. In OPL text, the process name shall appear in bold face with capitalization of each word.

===Links===
[[File:OPM Sructural Links.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM structural links]]
[[File:OPM Procedural Links.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM procedural links]]
; Structural link : A structural links defines a structural relation. A structural relation shall specify an association that persists in the system for at least some interval of time.
; Procedural link : A procedural link defines procedural relation. A procedural relation shall specify how the system operates to attain its function, designating time dependent or conditional triggering of processes, which transform objects.
; Event and condition : The Event-Condition-Action paradigm provides the OPM operational semantics and flow of control. An event is a point in time at which an object is created (or appears to be created from the system's perspective) or an object enters a specified state. At runtime, this process triggering initiates evaluation of the process precondition. Thus, starting a process execution has two prerequisites: (1)  a triggering event, and (2) satisfaction of a precondition.
Once the event triggers a process, the event ceases to exist. The precondition is the existence of the required object instances in the preprocess object set, possibly in specific states, as modeled. If and only if the evaluation reveals satisfaction of the precondition, the process starts executing.

==Syntax and semantics==

===Things===
An OPM thing is a generalization of object and process. Objects and processes are symmetric in many regards and have much in common in terms of relations, such as aggregation, generalization, and characterization. OPM objects and OPM processes depend on each other in the sense that an object cannot be transformed without a process, while a process cannot happen without transforming at least one object.

To apply OPM in a useful manner, the modeler has to make the essential distinction between objects and processes, as a prerequisite for successful system analysis and design. By default, a noun shall identify an object.

===Thing generic attributes===
OPM things have the following three generic attributes:
# ''Perseverance'', which pertains to the thing's persistence and determines whether the thing is static, i.e., an object, or dynamic, i.e., a process.
# ''Essence'', which pertains to the thing's nature and determines whether the thing is physical or informatical. Accordingly, the values of the generic attribute Essence are physical and informatical.
# ''Affiliation'', which pertains to the thing's scope and determines whether the thing is systemic, i.e., part of the system, or environmental, i.e., part of the system's environment. Accordingly, the values of the generic attribute Affiliation are systemic and environmental. Graphically shading effects shall depict physical OPM things and dashed lines shall depict environmental OPM things.

OPM thing generic attributes have the following default values:
# The default value of the ''Affiliation'' generic attribute of a thing is systemic.
# System essence shall be the primary essence of the system. Like thing essence, its values are informatical and physical. Information systems, in which the majority of things are informatical, shall be primarily informatical, while systems in which the majority of things are physical shall be primarily physical.
# The default value of the ''Essence'' generic attribute of a thing in a primarily informatical [physical] system shall be informatical [physical].

===Object states===
[[File:OPM Things.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM things and object states]]
; Stateful and stateless objects : An object state is a possible situation in which an object may exist. An object state has meaning only in the context of the object to which it belongs. A stateless object shall be an object that has no specification of states. A stateful object shall be an object for which a set of permissible states are specified. In a runtime model, at any point in time, any stateful object instance is at a particular permissible state or in transition between two states.
; Attribute values : An attribute is an object that characterizes a thing. An attribute value is a specialization of state in the sense that a value is a state of an attribute: an object has an attribute, which is a different object, to which that value is assigned for some period of time during the existence of the object exhibiting that attribute.
; Object state representation : A state is graphically defined by a labelled, rounded-corner rectangle placed inside the owning object. It can not live without an object. In OPL text, the state name shall appear in bold face without capitalization.
; Initial, default, and final states : The initial state of an object is its state as the system starts executing or its state upon generation by the system during execution. The final state of an object is its state as the system completes executing or its state upon consumption by the system during execution. The default state of an object is its expected state—the state in which the object is most likely to be when randomly inspected. An object can have zero or more initial states, zero or more final states, and zero or one default state.
; Initial, final, and default state representation : A state that is initial is graphically defined by a state representation with thick contour. A state that is final is graphically defined by a state representation with double contour. A state that is default is graphically defined by a state representation with an open arrow pointing diagonally from the left. The corresponding OPL sentences shall include explicit indicators for an initial, final or default state.

===Links===

====Procedural links====
[[File:OPM Transforming Links.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM Transforming Links]]
A procedural link is one of three kinds:
# ''Transforming link'', which connects a transformee (an object that the process transforms) or its state with a process to model object transformation, namely generation, consumption, or state change of that object as a result of the process execution.
# ''Enabling link'', which connects an enabler (an object that enables the process occurrence but is not transformed by that process) or its state, to a process, which enables the occurrence of that process.
# ''Control link'', which is a procedural (transforming or enabling) link with a control modifier—the letter e (for event) or c (for condition), which adds semantics of a control element. The letter e signifies an event for triggering the linked process, while the letter c signifies a condition for execution of the linked process, or connection of two processes denoting invocation, or exception.

; Procedural link uniqueness OPM principle :A process needs to transform at least one object. Hence, a process shall be connected via a transforming link to at least one object or object state. At any particular extent of abstraction, an object or any one of its states shall have exactly one role as a model element with respect to a process to which it links: the object may be a transformee or an enabler. Additionally, it can be a trigger for an event (if it has the control modifier e), or a conditioning object (if it has the control modifier c), or both. According to the procedural link uniqueness OPM principle, at a given extent of abstraction, an object or an object state shall link to a process by only one procedural link.
; State-specified procedural links : Each procedural link may be qualified as state-specified procedural links. A state-specified procedural link is a detailed version of its procedural link counterpart in that rather than connecting a process to an object, it connects a process to a specific state of that object.[[File:OPM Enabling Links.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM enabling links]]
; Transforming links : A transforming link specifies a connection between a process and its transformee (the object it creates, consumes, or changes the object state). The three kinds of transforming links are:
# ''Consumption link'': A transforming link specifying that the linked process consumes (destroys, eliminates) the linked object, the consumee. Existence of the consumee is precondition (or part of the precondition) to the activation of the process. Graphically, an arrow with a closed arrowhead pointing from the consumee to the consuming process defines the consumption link. By assumption, the consumed object disappears as soon as the process begins execution. The syntax of a consumption link OPL sentence is: Processing consumes Consumee.
# ''Effect link'': An transforming link specifying that the linked process affects the linked object, which is the affectee, i.e., the process causes some unspecified change in the state of the affectee. Graphically, a bidirectional arrow with two closed arrowheads, one pointing in each direction between the affecting process and the affected object, shall define the effect link. The syntax of an effect link OPL sentence is: Processing affects Affectee.
# ''Result link'': A transforming link specifying that the linked process creates (generates, yields) the linked object, which is the resultee. Graphically, an arrow with a closed arrowhead pointing from the creating process to the resultee shall define a result link. The syntax of a result link OPL sentence is: Processing yields Resultee.

[[File:OPM State-specified transforming links.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM state-specified transforming links]]
; Enabling links : An enabling link is a procedural link specifying an enabler for a process—an object that must be present for that process to occur, but the existence and state of that object after the process is complete are the same as just before the process began. The two kinds of enabling links are:
# ''Agent and agent link'': A human or a group of humans capable of intelligent decision-making, who enable a process by interacting with the system to enable or control the process throughout execution. It is an enabling link specifying that the agent object is necessary for the linked process to execute. Graphically, a line with a filled circle ("black lollipop") at the terminal end extending from the agent object to the process it enables defines an agent link. The syntax of an agent link OPL sentence is: Agent handles Processing.
# ''Instrument and instrument link'': An inanimate or otherwise non-decision-making enabler of a process that cannot start or take place without the existence and availability of the instrument. It is an enabling link specifying that the instrument object is necessary for the linked process to execute. Graphically, a line with an open circle ("white lollipop") at the terminal end extending from the instrument object to the process it enables defines an instrument link. The syntax of an instrument link OPL sentence is: Processing requires Instrument.

; State-specified transforming links : A state-specified transforming link connects one of the transformee states to or from that process.
# ''State-specified consumption link'': A consumption link that originates from a particular state of the consumee, meaning that the consumee must be in that state for it to be consumed by the process to which it is linked. Graphically, an arrow with a closed arrowhead pointing from the particular object state to the process, which consumes the object, defines the state-specified consumption link. The syntax OPL sentence is: Process consumes qualified-state Object.
# ''State-specified result link'': A result link that terminates at a specific state of the resultee, meaning that the resultee shall be in that resultant state upon its construction. Graphically, an arrow with a closed arrowhead pointing from the process to the particular object state defines the state-specified result link. The syntax OPL sentence is: Process yields qualified-state Object.
# ''State-specified effect links'':
#* Input and output effect links- An input link is the link from the object's input state to the transforming process, while the output link is the link from the transforming process to the object's output state.
#* Input-output-specified effect link: A pair of effect links, where the input link originates from a particular state of the affectee and the output link originates from that process and terminates at the output state of the same affectee. Graphically, a pair of arrows with a closed arrowhead from the input state of the affectee to the affecting process and a similar arrow from that process to the state of the affectee at process terminates defines the input-output-specified effect link. The syntax OPL sentence is: Process changes Object from input-state to output-state.
#* Input-specified effect link: A pair of effect links, where the input link originates from a particular state of the affectee and the output link originates from that process and terminates at the affectee without specifying a particular state. Graphically, a pair of arrows consisting of an arrow with a closed arrowhead from a particular state—the input state—of the affectee to the process, and a similar arrow from that process to the affectee but not to any one of its states defines the input-specified effect link. The syntax OPL sentence is: Process changes Object from input-state.
#* Output-specified effect link: A pair of effect links, where the input (source) link originates from an affectee, and the output link originates from the process and terminates at the output (destination, resultant) state of the same affectee. Graphically, a pair of arrows consisting of an arrow with a closed arrowhead from the affectee, but not from any one of its states, to the affecting process, and a similar arrow from that process to a particular state of that affectee— the output state— defines the output-specified effect link. The syntax OPL sentence is: Process changes Object to output-state.

[[File:OPM Basic transforming event links.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM basic transforming event links]]
; State-specified enabling links : Originate from a specific qualifying state and terminate at a process, meaning that the process may occur if and only if the object exists at the state from which the link originates.
# ''State-specified agent link'': An agent link that originates from a specific qualifying state of the agent. Graphically, a line with a filled circle ("black lollipop") at the terminal end extending from the qualifying state of the agent object to the process it enables defines a state-specified agent link. The syntax OPL sentence is: Qualifying-state Agent handles Processing.
# ''State-specified instrument link'': An instrument link that originates from a specific qualifying state of the instrument. Graphically, a line with an empty circle ("white lollipop") at the terminal end extending from the qualifying state of the instrument object to the process it enables defines a state-specified instrument link. The syntax OPL sentence is: Processing requires qualifying-state instrument.

====Event-Condition-Action control====

; Preprocess object set and process precondition : In order for an OPM process to start executing once it has been triggered, it needs a set of objects comprising one or more consumes, some possibly at specific states, and/or affects, collectively called the preprocess object set. The pre-process object set determines the precondition that must be satisfied before execution of that process starts and as a condition for that process to start executing. At instance-level execution, each consume B in the pre-process object set of process P shall be consumed and stop to exist at the beginning of the lowest level sub-process of P which consumes B. Each affected (an object whose state changes) B in the preprocess object set of process P shall exit from its input state at the beginning of the lowest level sub-process of P.
[[File:OPM Basic Enabling event links.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM basic enabling event links]]
; Post-process object set and process post-condition : A set of objects, comprising one or more results, some possibly at given states, and/or affects, collectively called the post-process object set, shall result from executing a process and carrying out the transformations associated with its execution. The post-process object set shall determine the post-condition, which shall be satisfied after execution of that process ends. Each resulted B in the post process object set of process P shall be created and start to exist at the end of the lowest level sub process of P which yields B. Each affected B in the post-process object set of process P shall enter its output state at the end of the lowest level sub-process of P.

====Control links====
An event link and a condition link express an event and a condition, respectively. Control links occur either between an object and a process or between two processes.

; Event links : An event link specifies a source event and a destination process to activate on event occurrence. Triggering a process initiates an attempt to execute the process, but it does not guarantee success of this attempt. The triggering event forces an evaluation of the process' precondition for satisfaction, which, if and only if satisfied, allows process execution to proceed and the process becomes active. Regardless of whether the precondition is satisfied or not, the event will be lost. If the precondition is not satisfied, process execution will not occur until another event activates the process and a successful precondition evaluation allows the process to execute.
[[File:OPM State-specified transforming event links.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM state-specified transforming event links]]
# ''Basic transforming event links'': A consumption event link is a link between an object and a process, which an instance of the object activates. Satisfaction of the process precondition and the subsequent process execution need to consume (affect) the instance of the activating object.
#* Consumption event link: Graphically, an arrow with a closed arrowhead pointing from the object to the process with the small letter e (for event). The syntax of a consumption event link OPL sentence is: Object triggers Process, which consumes Object.
#* Effect event link: Graphically, a bidirectional arrow with closed arrowheads at each end between the object and the process with a small letter e (for event). The syntax of an effect event link OPL sentence is: Object triggers Process, which affects Object.
[[File:OPM State-specified agent event link.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM state-specified agent event link]]
# ''Basic enabling event links'':
#* Agent event link: An agent event link is an enabling link from an agent object to the process that it activates and enables. Graphically, a line with a filled circle ("black lollipop") at the terminal end extending from an agent object to the process it activates and enables with a small letter e (for event). The syntax of an agent event link OPL sentence is: Agent triggers and handles Process.
#* Instrument event link: An instrument event link is an enabling link from an instrument object to the process that it activates and enables. Graphically, a line with an empty circle ("white lollipop') at the terminal end extending from the instrument object to the process it activates and enables with a small letter e (for event). The syntax of an instrument event link OPL sentence is: Instrument triggers Process, which requires Instrument.
#''State-specified transforming event links'':
#* State-specified consumption event link: A state-specified consumption event link is a consumption link that originates from a specific state of an object and terminates at a process, which an instance of the object activates.

====Structural links====
Structural links specify static, time-independent, long-lasting relations in the system. A structural link connects two or more objects or two or more processes, but not an object and a process, except in the case of an exhibition-characterization link.

; Unidirectional tagged structural link : Has a user-defined semantics regarding the nature of the relation from one thing to the other. Graphically, an arrow with an open arrowhead. Along the tagged structural link, the modeler should record a meaningful tag in the form of a textual phrase that expresses the nature of the structural relation between the connected objects (or processes) and makes sense when placed in the OPL sentence whose syntax follows.
; Unidirectional null-tagged structural link : An unidirectional tagged structural link with no tag. In this case, the default unidirectional tag is used. The modeler has the option of setting the default unidirectional tag for a specific system or a set of systems. If no default is defined, the default tag is "relates to".
; Bidirectional tagged structural link : When the tags in both directions are meaningful and not just the inverse of each other, they may be recorded by two tags on either side of a single bidirectional tagged structural link. Each tag shall align on the side of the arrow with the harpoon edge sticking out of the arrowhead unambiguously determining the direction in which each relation applies. The syntax of the resulting tagged structural link is two separate tagged structural link OPL sentences, one for each direction. Graphically, a line with harpoon shaped arrowheads on opposite sides at both ends of the link's line shall.
; Reciprocal tagged structural link : A reciprocal tagged structural link is a bidirectional tagged structural link with no more than one tag. In either case, reciprocity indicate that the tag of a bidirectional structural link has the same semantics for its forward and backward directions. When no tag appears, the default tag shall be "are related". The syntax of the reciprocal tagged structural link with only one tag shall be: Source-thing and destination thing are reciprocity-tag. The syntax of the reciprocal tagged structural link with no tag is: Source thing and Destination-thing are related.
; Fundamental structural relations : The most prevalent structural relations among OPM things and are of particular significance for specifying and understanding systems. Each of the fundamental relations is elaborate or refine one OPM thing, the source thing, or refinee, into a collection of one or more OPM things, the destination thing or things, or refineables. The fundamental structural relations are; Aggregation, Exhibition-characterization, Generalization-specialization, and Classification-instantiation.
; Aggregation-participation link : A refinee—the whole—aggregates one or more other refineables—the parts. Graphically, a black solid (filled in) triangle with its apex connecting by a line to the whole and the parts connecting by lines to the opposite horizontal base shall denote the aggregation-participation relation link.
; Exhibition-characterization link : A thing exhibits, or is characterized by, another thing. The exhibition-characterization relation binds a refinee—the exhibitor—with one or more refineables, which shall identify features that characterize the exhibitor Graphically, a smaller black triangle inside a larger empty triangle with that larger triangle's apex connecting by a line to the exhibitor and the features connecting to the opposite (horizontal) base defines the exhibition-characterization relation link.
; Generalization-specialization and inheritance : These are structural relations which provide for abstracting any number of objects or process classes into superclasses, and assigning attributes of superclasses to subordinate classes.
# ''Generalization-specialization link'': The refinee—the general—generalizes the refineables, which are specializations of the general. Binds one or more specializations with the same persistence attribute value as the general, such that either the general and all its specializations are objects or the general and all its specializations are processes. Graphically, an empty triangle with its apex connecting by a line to the general and the specializations connecting by lines to the opposite base defines the generalization-specialization link.
# ''Inheritance through specialization'': Inheritance is assignment of OPM elements of a general to its specializations. A specialization inherits from the general thing through the generalization-specialization link the following four kinds of inheritable elements, if there are any: 1. all the general's parts from its aggregation-participation link; 2. all the general's features from its exhibition-characterization link; 3. all the tagged structural links to which the general connects; and 4. all the procedural links to which the general connects. [[File:OPM Condition state-specified enabling link.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM condition state-specified enabling link]]
# ''Specialization restriction through discriminating attribute'': A subset of the possible values of an inherited attribute may restrict the specialization. An attribute whose different values determine corresponding specializations is a discriminating attribute. [[File:OPM Fundamental structural relations and link.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM fundamental structural relations and links]]
; Classification-instantiation and system execution : The relation between a class of things and an instance of that class in the system at the operational level.
# ''Classification-instantiation link'': A source thing, which is an object class or a process class connect to one or more destination things, which are valued instances of the source thing's pattern, i.e. the features specified by the pattern acquire explicit values. This relation provides the modeler with an explicit mechanism for expressing the relationship between a class and its instances created by the provision of feature values. Graphically, a small black circle inside an otherwise empty larger triangle with apex connecting by a line to the class thing and the instance things connecting by lines to the opposite base defines the classification-instantiation relation link. The syntax is: Instance-thing is an instance of Class-thing.
# ''Instances of object class and process class'': These are two distinct kinds of classes. An instance of a class is an incarnation of a particular identifiable instance of that class, an actual object of some class of objects bearing the same classification identifier. A single actual object is an object instance, while the pattern of object, which all the instances follow, is an object class. A process class is a pattern of happening, which involves object classes that are members of the preprocess and postprocess object sets. A single actual process occurrence, which follows this pattern and involves particular object instances in its preporcess and postprocess object sets, is a process instance. Hence, a process instance is a particular occurrence of a process class to which that instance belongs. Any process instance have associated with it a distinct set of preporcess and postprocess object instance sets.
; State-specified structural relations and links : These provide for associating a state of one object with another object or with a state of another object. [[File:OPM State-specified structural relations and links.png|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM state-specified structural relations and links]]
# ''State-specified characterization relation and link'': An exhibition-characterization relation from a specialized object that exhibits a value for a discriminating attribute of that object, meaning that the specialized object shall have only that value. Graphically, the exhibition-characterization link triangular symbol, with its apex connecting to the specialized object and its opposite base connecting to the value, defines the state-specified characterization relation. The syntax is: Specialized-object exhibits value-name Attribute-Name.
# ''State-specified tagged structural relations and links'': A structural relation between a state of an object or value of an attribute and another object or its state or value, meaning that these two entities are associated with the tag expressing the semantics of the association. In case of a null tag (i.e., the tag is not specified), the corresponding default null tag is used. Three groups of state-specified tagged structural relations exist: (1) source state-specified tagged structural relation, (2) destination state-specified tagged structural relation, (3) source-and-destination state-specified tagged structural relation. Each of these groups includes the appropriate unidirectional, bidirectional, and reciprocal tagged structural relation, giving rise to seven kinds of state-specified tagged structural relation link and corresponding OPL sentences.

===Relationship cardinalities===
[[File:Link cardinalities summary.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Link cardinalities summary]][[File:Object multiplicity in structural and procedural links.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Object multiplicity in structural and procedural links]]

; Object multiplicity in structural and procedural links
Object multiplicity shall refer to a requirement or constraint specification on the quantity or count of object instances associated with a link. Unless a multiplicity specification is present, each end of a link shall specify only one thing instance. The syntax of an OPL sentence that includes an object with multiplicity shall include the object multiplicity preceding the object name, with the object name appearing in its plural form. Multiplicity specifications may appear in the following cases:
# to specify multiple source or destination object instances for a tagged structural link of any kind;
# to specify a participant object with multiple instances in an aggregation-participation link, where a different participation specification may be attached to each one of the parts of the whole;
# to specify an object with multiple instances in a procedural relation.

; Object multiplicity expressions and constraints
Object multiplicity may include arithmetic expressions, which shall use the operator symbols "+", "–", "*", "/", "(", and ")" with their usual semantics and shall use the usual textual correspondence in the corresponding OPL sentences.

An integer or an arithmetic expression may constrain object multiplicity. Graphically, expression constraints shall appear after a semicolon separating them from the expression that they constrain and shall use the equality/inequality symbols "=", "&lt;", "&gt;", "&lt;=", and "&gt;=", the curly braces "{" and "}" for enclosing set members, and the membership operator "in" (element of, ∈), all with their usual semantics. The corresponding OPL sentence shall place the constraint phrase in bold letters after the object to which the constraint applies in the form ", where constraint".

; Attribute value and multiplicity constraints
The expression of object multiplicity for structural and procedural links specifies integer values or parameter symbols that resolve to integer values. In contrast, the values associated with attributes of objects or processes may be integer or real values, or parameter symbols that resolve to integer or real values, as well as character strings and enumerated values. Graphically, a labelled, rounded-corner rectangle placed inside the attribute to which it belongs shall denote an attribute value with the value or value range (integers, real numbers, or string characters) corresponding to the label name. In OPL text, the attribute value shall appear in bold face without capitalization.

The syntax for an object with an attribute value OPL sentence shall be: ''Attribute'' of ''Object'' is ''value''.

The syntax for an object with an attribute value range OPL sentence shall be: ''Attribute'' of ''Object'' range is ''value-range''. A structural or a procedural link connecting with an attribute that has a real number value may specify a relationship constraint, which is distinct from an object multiplicity.

Graphically, an attribute value constraint is an annotation by a number, integer or real, or a symbol parameter, near the attribute end of the link and aligning with the link.

===Logical operators: AND, XOR, and OR===
[[File:Logical AND procedural links.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Logical AND procedural links]]

; Logical AND procedural links
The logical operators AND, XOR, and OR among procedural relations enable specification of elaborate process precondition and postcondition. Separate, non-touching links shall have the semantics of logical AND.
In the example, opening the safe requires all three keys. [[File:Summary of XOR and OR converging consumption and result links.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|XOR and OR converging consumption and result links]]

; Logical XOR and OR procedural links
A group of two or more procedural links of the same kind that originate from, or arrive at, the same object or process shall be a link fan. A link fan shall follow the semantics of either a XOR or an OR operator. The link fan end that is common to the links shall be the convergent link end. The link end that is not common to the links shall be the divergent link end.

The XOR operator shall mean that exactly one of the things in the span of the link fan exists, if the divergent link end has objects, or happens, if the divergent link end has processes. Graphically, a dashed arc across the links in the link fan with the arc focal point at the convergent end point of contact shall denote the XOR operator.

The OR operator shall mean that at least one of the two or more things in the span of the link fan exists, if the divergent link end has objects, or happens, if the divergent end has processes. Graphically, two concentric dashed arcs across the links with their focal point at the convergent end point of contact shall denote the OR operator.

; State-specified XOR and OR link fans
Each one of the link fans in shall have a corresponding state-specified version, where the source and destination may be specific object states or objects without a state specification. Combinations of state-specified and stateless links as destinations of a link fan may occur.
[[File:Control-modified link fans.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Control-modified link fans]]
; Control-modified link fans : Each one of the XOR link fans for consumption, result, effect, and enabling links and their state-specified versions shall have a corresponding control-modified link fan: an event link fan and a condition link fan. The example presents the event and condition effect link fans, as representatives of the basic (non-state-specified) links version of the modified link fans.
[[File:Link probabilities and probabilistic link fans.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Link probabilities and probabilistic link fans]]
; Link probabilities and probabilistic link fans : A process P with a result link that yields a stateful object B with n states s1 through sn shall mean that the probability of generating B at each one of its states shall be 1/n. The single result link shall be used instead of the result link fan. Usually, probabilities of following a specific link in a link fan are not equal. Link probability shall be a value assigned to a link in a XOR diverging link fan that specifies the probability of following that particular link among the possible links in the fan link. A probabilistic link fan shall be a link fan with probability annotations on each fan link, where the sum of the probabilities shall be exactly 1. Graphically, along each fan link an annotation shall appear in the form Pr=p, where p is the link probability numeric value or a parameter, which denotes the probability of the system control to select and follow that particular link of the fan. The corresponding OPL sentence shall be the XOR diverging link fan sentence without link probabilities omitting the phrase "exactly one of…" and the phrase "…with probability p" following each things name with a probability annotation "Pr=p".
[[File:Execution path and path labels.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Execution path and path labels]]
; Execution path and path labels : A path label shall be a label along a procedural link, which, in the case that there is more than one option to follow upon process termination, prescribes that the link to follow will be the one having the same label as the one which we entered the process, A path label is a label on a procedural link that removes the ambiguity arising from multiple outgoing procedural links by specifying that the link to be followed is the one with the same label as the one with which the process was entered.

==Modeling principles and model comprehension==
System function and modeling purpose is to guide the scope and level of detail of an OPM model. The definition of system purpose, scope, and function in terms of boundary, stakeholders and preconditions is the basis for determining whether other elements should appear in the model. This determines the scope of the system model.
OPM provides abstracting and refining mechanisms to manage the expression of model clarity and completeness. The model has a hierarchy tree for refinement, elaboration, or decomposition obtained by unfolding.&lt;ref name="ISO19450"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Model-Based"/&gt;

; Stakeholder and system's beneficiary identification
In order to start an OPM model of a system, the first step is to determine the function of the system—the main process of the system. A beneficiary of the artificial, man-made system is a stakeholder who receives functional value and benefits from the function of the system. For man-made systems this function is expected to benefit a person or a group of people—the beneficiary. After the function of the system aligns with the functional value expectation of its main beneficiary, the modeler identifies and adds other principal stakeholders to the OPM model. Modeling a system starts by defining, naming, and depicting the function of the system, which is also its top-level process.

; System diagram
The resulting top-level OPD is the system diagram (SD), which includes the stakeholder group, in particular the beneficiary group, and additional top-level environmental things, which provide the context for the system's operation. The SD should contain only the central and important things—those things indispensable for understanding the function and context of the system. The function is the main process in SD, which also contains the objects involved in this process: the beneficiary, the operand (the object upon which the process operates), and possibly the attribute of the operand whose value the process changes. An OPM model fact needs to appear in at least one OPD in order for it to be represented in the model. SD should also contain an object representing the system that enables the function. The default name of this system is created by adding the word "System" to the name of the function. For example, if the function is Car Painting, the name of the system would be Car Painting System.

; OPD tree
[[File:OPD process tree.png|thumb|An OPD process tree with two nodes and one labelled edge]]
SD is always the only top-level OPD—it is the root of the OPD tree. The set of OPDs, organized as a process tree, which together specify the system. The OPD set keeps growing as additional OPDs are gradually constructed to increasingly refine the model and make it more concrete. The ability to add a descendant, subordinate OPD whenever the one currently under work reaches its congestion limits makes it possible to avoid over-cluttering any single OPD.

; Clarity and completeness trade-off
Clarity is the extent of unambiguous comprehension the system's structure and behavior models convey. Completeness is the extent of specification for all the system's details.  These two model attributes conflict with each other. On the one hand, completeness requires the full stipulation of system details. On the other hand, the need for clarity imposes an upper limit on the extent of detail within an individual model diagram, after which comprehension deteriorates because of clutter and overloading.  Establishing an appropriate balance requires careful management of context during model development. However, the modeler may take advantage of the union of information provided by the entire OPD set of an OPM system model and have one OPD which is clear and unambiguous but not complete, and another that focuses on completeness for some smaller part of the system by adding more details.

; Refinement-abstraction mechanisms
OPM shall provide abstracting and refining mechanisms to manage the expression of model clarity and completeness. These mechanisms make possible the specification of contextualized model segments as separate, yet interconnected OPDs which, taken together, shall provide a model of the functional value providing system. These mechanisms shall enable presenting and viewing the system, and the things that comprise it, in various contexts that are interrelated by the objects, processes and relations that are common amongst them. Explicitly depicting the states of an object in an OPD may result in a diagram that is too crowded or busy, making it hard to read or comprehend. The OPM refinement-abstraction mechanisms shall be the following pairs of inverse operations: State expression and suppression, unfolding and folding, and in-zooming and outzooming.

; State expression and state suppression
[[File:State OPM.png|thumb|upright=1.5|A stateful object with all its five states expressed (left) and a suppressed version (right), in which only the relevant subset of states are left while the rest are replaced by the ellipsis (…) state]]
OPM shall provide an option for state suppression, i.e., suppressing the appearance of some or all the states
within an object as represented in a particular OPD when those states are not necessary in that OPD's context.
The inverse of state suppression shall be state expression, i.e., refining the OPD by adding the information
concerning possible object states. The OPL corresponding to the OPD shall express only the states of the
objects that are depicted.

; Unfolding and folding
Unfolding is a mechanism for refinement, elaboration, or decomposition. It reveals a set of things that are hierarchically below the unfolded thing. The result is a hierarchy tree, the root of which is the unfolded thing. Linked to the root are the things that constitute the context of the unfolded thing. Conversely, folding is a mechanism for abstraction or composition, which applies to an unfolded hierarchical tree.

; In-zooming and out-zooming
In-zooming is a kind of unfolding, which is applicable to aggregation-participation only and has additional semantics. For processes, in-zooming enables modeling the sub-processes, their temporal order, their interactions with objects, and passing of control to and from this context. For objects, in-zooming creates a distinct context that enables modeling the constituent objects spatial or logical order. Graphically, the timeline within the context of an in-zoomed process flows from the top of its process ellipse symbol to the ellipse bottom.

==Meta modeling==
[[File:OPM Model.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM model structure]]
A metamodel is a model of a model. In particular, using OPM model to present aspects of OPM. The examples described here are a part of the comprehensive metamodels of OPM appear in an annex of ISO 19450.

; OPM model structure
[[File:OPM Model 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM model structure—OPL]]
OPM model is a metamodel, as shown in the image of OPM model on the right. Using OPM to specify the structure of an OPM model of a system. It depicts the conceptual aspects of OPM as parallel hierarchies of the graphic and textual OPM modalities and their correspondence to produce equivalent model expressions. An OPD Construct is the graphical expression of the corresponding textual OPL Sentence, which express the same model fact. An OPD and its corresponding OPL Paragraph are collections of model facts that a modeller places into the same model context.

; Model of OPD Construct and Basic Construct
[[File:OPD Metamodel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|OPD model]]
The model, as seen in the image of OPD metamodel, elaborates the OPD Construct concept. The purpose of this model is to distinguish Basic Construct from another possible OPD Construct. A Basic Construct is a specialization of OPD Construct, which consists of exactly two Things connected by exactly one Link. The non-basic constructs include, among others, those with link fans or more than two refinees.

A modeller could add a process to the model, by adding states disconnected and connected of Thing Set.
The purpose of the model thus includes the action of transforming a disconnected Thing Set to a connected Thing Set using the Link Set as an instrument of connection.

; OPM model of Thing
[[File:OPM model of Thing.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM model of Thing]]
OPM model of Thing, is a model for an OPM Thing, showing its specialization into Object and Process, as depicted in the image of model of thing below. A set of States characterize Object, which can be empty, in a Stateless Object, or non-empty in the case of a Stateful Object.

A Stateful Object with s States gives rise to a set of s stateless State-Specific Objects, one for each State.
A particular State-Specific Object refers to an object in a specific state. Modelling the concept of State-Specific Object as both an Object and a State enables simplifying the conceptual model by referring to an object and any one or its states by simply specifying Object.

[[File:OPM model of Thing generic properties.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|OPM model of Thing generic properties]]
OPM model of Thing generic properties, depicts Thing and its Perseverance, Essence, and Affiliation generic properties modelled as attribute refinees of an exhibition-characterization link. Perseverance is the discriminating attribute between Object and Process. Essence is the discriminating attribute between Physical Object and Physical Process on the one hand, Informatical Object, and Informatical Process on the other hand. Affiliation is the discriminating attribute between Systemic Object and Systemic Process on the one hand, Environmental Object, and Environmental Process on the other hand.

; In-zooming and out-zooming models
[[File:Zoom OPM.png|thumb|upright=1.5|New-diagram in-zooming generic example]]
Both new-diagram in-zooming and new-diagram out-zooming create a new OPD context from an existing OPD context. New-diagram in-zooming starts with an OPD of relatively less details and adds elaboration or refinement as a descendant OPD that applies to a specific thing in the less detailed OPD.

New-diagram out-zooming starts with an OPD of relatively more details and removes elaboration or refinement to produce a less detailed, more abstract thing in an ancestor context.

New-diagram in-zooming elaborates a refineable present in an existing OPD, say SDn, by creating a new OPD, SDn+1, which elaborates the refineable by adding subprocesses associated objects, and relevant links. The new-diagram in-zooming and in new-diagram out-zooming processes are inverse operations.

New-diagram in-zooming and new-diagram out-zooming models depict the new-diagram in-zooming and new-diagram out-zooming processes. The model on the right uses in-diagram in-zooming of the model on the left to elaborate the two processes, one for creating a new-diagram in-zoomed context and one for creating a new-diagram out-zoomed context.

New-diagram in-zooming begins with Content Showing, followed by Link Refining. New-diagram out-zooming begins with Link Abstracting, the inverse process of Link Refining, followed by Content Hiding, the inverse process of Content Showing.

==Versions==
[[File:Object Process Methodology (logo).jpg|thumb|upright|OPM logo]]

; OPM
The current version of OPM is ISO/PAS 19450:2015 as specified in Automation Systems and Integration — Object-Process Methodology.&lt;ref name="ISO19450" /&gt; The specification in Dori's 2016 book is a superset of ISO/PAS 19450:2015.&lt;ref name="Model-Based" /&gt;

The previous version of OPM was specified in Dori's 2002 book.&lt;ref name="Object-Process Methodology – A Holistic Systems Paradigm" /&gt;

; OPCAT
The current OPCAT version is 4.1. It is available freely from Technion's Enterprise Systems Modeling Laboratory.&lt;ref name="OPCAT"/&gt;

A previous OPCAT version, 3.1, with fewer capabilities, is also available from the same site. Both are coded in Java. The first OPCAT version, OPCAT 1.X, was written in Visual C++ in 1998.

In the beginning of 2016 a team of students under the management of Dori began working on the new generation of OPCAT which will be called OPCloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Enterprise Systems Modeling Laboratory |title=opcloud |url=https://www.opcloud.tech/}}&lt;/ref&gt; As suggested by the name of the software, it will be a cloud-based application, and will enable users to create OPM models using a web-based application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dori |first1=Dov |last2=Jbara |first2=Ahmad |last3=Levi |first3=Natali |last4=Wengrowicz |first4=Niva |title=Object-Process Methodology, OPM ISO 19450 – OPCloud and the Evolution of OPM Modeling Tools |url=https://www.ppi-int.com/syen61-a1/ |website=Project Performance International |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standardization==
[[ISO]]—the International Organization for Standardization—is an independent, non-governmental international organization with a membership of 162 national standards bodies, which develops voluntary, consensus-based, market relevant International Standards that support innovation and provide solutions to global challenges. These standards provide world-class specifications for products, services and systems, to ensure quality, safety and efficiency.

===ISO and OPM===
In June 2008, Richard Martin approached [[Dov Dori]] after his presentation at the [[International Council on Systems Engineering|INCOSE]] International Symposium in Utrecht, the Netherlands, to inquire about the possibility of creating an International Standard for OPM.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Martin, convener of ISO TC184/SC5/WG1 for automation systems interoperability architecture and modelling, had for some time been searching for methodologies offering more than static information and process modeling.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} He provided Dori with a simple example to model that could demonstrate both the modelling capability of OPM and its dynamic simulation opportunity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In May 2010, Dori presented a brief overview of OPM and his demonstration model at the ISO Technical Committee 184/Sub-Committee 5 (TC184/SC5) plenary meeting, which then adopted a resolution to create and OPM Study Group for the purpose of examining the potential for OPM to enhance the standards created by SC5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dori |first1=Dov |last2=Howes |first2=David |last3=Blekhman |first3=Alex |last4=Martin |first4=Richard |title=OPM as a Basis for Model - Based Enterprise Standards, Report of the ISO TC184/SC5 OPM Working Group to the Plenary ISO TC184/SC5Meeting, Tokyo 26, 2010 |url=http://esml.iem.technion.ac.il/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/OPM_WG_Report_to_TC184-SC5_Tokyo_March_26_2010.pdf |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OPM Study Group began its work in October 2010 and issued an interim report for the 2011 SC5 Plenary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Blekhman |first1=Alex |last2=Dori |first2=Dov |last3=Martin |first3=Richard |title=Model-Based Standards Authoring |url=http://esml.iem.technion.ac.il/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Model-Based-Standards-Authoring-March-2011.pdf |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report included several uses of OPM to model existing SC5 standards and led to an initial motivation for the standardization of OPM with the realization that being text-based, ISO standards are prone to suffer from inconsistencies and incomplete information. This deficiency could be significantly reduced if the standards were model-based rather than text-based, and OPM offered a useful underlying modeling paradigm for this purpose.

A final OPM Study Group Report and a draft for a metamodel for model-based standards authoring document were delivered at the 2012 SC5 Plenary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=SC 5 PLENARY MEETING |title=Meeting Report |url=http://esml.iem.technion.ac.il/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ISO-TC184-SC5_N1185_2012_SC5_Plenary_Meeting_Report_-_Haifa_.pdf |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the OPM Study Group effort progressed, it became obvious that OPM could also serve as a solid and comprehensive basis for model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and for modeling both natural and man-made systems.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===ISO 19450 Document===
TC184/SC5/WG1 participants received the first draft of the OPM PAS in September 2011 with 16 pages, 2 annexes and a bibliography for a total of 25 pages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Most of the content simply identified sub-clause headings and space holder graphics.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} By the 2012 SC5 Plenary, the PAS draft included 10 full clauses describing OPM features and 6 annexes totaling 86 pages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} One annex was an EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form, used to formally specify context free languages, enabling parsing of programming languages) specification for OPL and another detailed OPD graph grammar. To facilitate verification of the EBNF specification, David Shorter wrote a script to evaluate consistency and completeness of the EBNF statement set.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Further effort to add meaningful examples and complete all of the identified sections resulted in a draft of 138 pages by the time of the 2013 SC5 Plenary.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Subsequently, the working draft was registered with the SC5 Secretariat as a Committee Draft for initial circulation to SC5 members.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Because the SC5 resolution calling for the OPM specification indicated that the document was to be registered as a [[Publicly Available Specification]] (PAS), it would have only one acceptance ballot opportunity. In April 2014, the New Work Item Proposal and revised Committee Draft for ISO/PAS 19450 was delivered to SC5 for consideration.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} By now the Committee Draft was 98 pages plus front matter, four annexes and 30 bibliographic references, totaling 183 pages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} In March 2015, ISO registered the result of balloting for ISO/PAS 19450 as 8 Approve, 1 Approve with comments, and 1 abstain.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

ISO/PAS 19450 was formally published with a total of 162 pages by ISO on December 15, 2015, culminating a six-year effort to provide the standardization community with a formal specification for a new approach to modeling that binds together graphics and textual representations into a single paradigm suitable for automated simulation of model behavior.

== OPM vs. SysML and UML ==
; OPM vs. SysML
[[File:OPMvsSYSML.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Comparison between SysML and OPM attributes]]
OPM and [[SysML]] represent two different approaches to system modeling. SysML is defined as an extension of the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) using [[profile (UML)|UML's profile mechanism]]. In SysML up to nine multiple models are used, which are independently derived, and may not be completely consistent.&lt;ref name="Object-Process Methodology – A Holistic Systems Paradigm"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2017}} In OPM, only one single model emerges. The need to integrate several kinds of models may be more complicated in OPM. In OPM there is a combination between complex—the inherent fact that a system contains many parts interacting in multiple, often inexplicable ways, and complexity—the way a system model is presented through a certain modeling language and is perceived by a user. OPM with its minimal ontology of stateful objects and processes favorably responds to the challenge of reducing the complexity of the representation to the bare necessities without sacrificing accuracy and details.&lt;ref name="SysMLvsOPM"/&gt;

; OPM vs. UML
The differences between OPM and UML are highly perceivable during the analysis and design stages. While UML is a multi-model, OPM supports a single unifying structure-behavior model. The crucial differences stem from the structure-oriented approach of UML, in which behavior is spread over thirteen diagram types, a fact that inevitably invokes the model multiplicity problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Peleg | first1 = M. | last2 = Dori | first2 = D. | year = 2000 | title = The Model Multiplicity Problem: Experimenting with Real-Time Specification Methods | url = | journal = IEEE Tran. on Software Engineering | volume = 26 | issue = 8| pages = 742–759 | doi=10.1109/32.879812}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, using the OPM approach enables to view at main diagram (SD) the main process, objects and the connection between them.&lt;ref name="Object-Process Methodology – A Holistic Systems Paradigm"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2017}} In addition, it easy to understand what is the main system's benefit (presented at the SD). In OPM, it's also easier to understand the main three aspects of the system: behavior, structure and functionality (contrary to UML which describes these aspects with different types of diagrams).&lt;ref name="Object-Process Methodology – A Holistic Systems Paradigm"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2017}} Database unfolding modeling contributes to the understanding of system and all details which is stored in the system. In addition, creating in-zooming enables simplifying the model. OPM requires extensive knowledge of systematic processes such as how the system saved the path and gets decisions.

==Generating SysML views from an OPM model==
While both languages aim at the same purpose of providing a means for general-purpose systems engineering, these languages take different approaches in realizing this goal. SysML is a profile of UML (Unified Modeling Language). Therefore, it is possible to convert an OPM diagram to an UML or SysML diagram.

The OPM-to SysML translation is one-to-many in the sense that a single OPM element (entity or link) usually translates to several SysML elements that belong in different SysML diagram types. For example, an OPM process, which is defined as an entity that transforms (generates, consumes, or changes the state of) an object, can be mapped to any subset of the following SysML entities:

* Use case (in a Use Case Diagram)
* Action (in an Activity Diagram)
* State transition trigger (in a State Machine Diagram).

As OPM and SysML are two distinct and differently designed languages, not all the constructs in one language have equivalent constructs in the other language.

[[File:OPMtoUML SD0.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Figure 1: Use Case Diagram generation of SD0]]
[[File:OPMtoUML SD1.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Figure 2: Use Case Diagram generation of SD1]]

# The first type of diagram in UML that can be generated from an OPM diagram is the Use Case Diagram which is intended for modeling the usage of a system. The main elements comprising the Use Case Diagram are actors and use cases (the entities) along with the relationships (links) among them. Generation of a Use Case Diagram from OPM is therefore based on environmental objects (the actors) and the processes (the use cases) linked to them. Figure 1 is an example of Use Case Diagram generation of SD0. The figure shows the root OPM diagram (a), the corresponding OPL text (b), and the created Use Case Diagram (c). Figure 2 shows a SD1 level of OPD from the same OPM model (a), and the generated Use Case Diagram (b).
# The second type of diagram is the Block Definition Diagram (BDD) which defines features of blocks (like properties and operations) and relationships between blocks, such as associations and generalizations. Generating a BDD is based upon the systemic objects of the OPM model and their relationships—mainly structural relations to other model elements.
# The third type of diagram is Activity Diagrams which are intended to specify flow. Key components included in the Activity Diagram are actions and routing flow elements. In our context, a separate Activity Diagram can be generated for each OPM process containing child subprocesses, i.e., a process which is in-zoomed in the OPM model. There are two kinds of user parameters that can be specified via the settings dialog. The first one deals with selection of the OPM processes: One option is to explicitly specify the required OPM processes by selection from a list. The alternative, which is the default option, is to start with the root OPD (SD) and go down the hierarchy. Here we reach the second parameter (that is independent of the first one), which is the required number of OPD levels (k) to go down the hierarchy. In order to give the user control over the level of abstraction, the diagrams are generated up to k levels down the hierarchy. Each level will result in the generation of an additional Activity Diagram, which is a child activity (subdiagram) contained in the enclosing higher-level activity. The default setting for this option is "all levels down" (i.e., "k = ∞").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grobshtein |first1=Yariv |last2=Dori |first2=Dov |title=Creating SysML views from an OPM model |date=2009 |publisher=IEEE |location=Haifa, Israel |isbn=978-1-4244-2967-7 |pages=36-44 |url=https://doi.org/10.1109/MBSE.2009.5031718 |accessdate=15 November 2018 |ref=SysMLfromOPM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The OPM to Activity Diagram Map.jpg|centre|thumb|598x598px]]

==Study of model comprehension==
In order to assess and examine the effectiveness of the newly developed OPM-to-SysML algorithm and application, Dov Dori and Yariv Grobshtein performed a controlled experiment, which had two major goals:

# Since improved system comprehension was among the potential predicted benefits, they ventured to examine whether the additional SysML diagrams that had been generated automatically with their new application affected system model comprehension;
# They wished to test the quality of the autocreated diagrams, mainly in terms of modeling errors and inconsistencies with the original OPM model from which they were generated.

They carried out the experiment within a lecture of the course "Enterprise Systems Modeling" taught in 2008. Testing the null hypothesis that there is no difference in comprehension level between the OPM-only model and the combined OPM-and-SysML model, against the two-sided alternative that there is a difference, they rejected the null hypothesis in both cases. For both systems, the students' answers to comprehension questions relating the combined OPM-and-SysML models were significantly better than answers relating to OPM-only models.

It seems that the additional diagrams were helpful in answering some of the questions more than the others. Only one question of eight in each of the cases scored lower when the combined diagrams specification was used. The SysML diagram that seems to have the biggest added value is the Block Definition Diagram (BDD), which specifies system hierarchy and features of blocks like attributes and operations. The relatively high helpfulness of the BDD is evident from both the students'assessment of the contribution of this diagram type and from analysis of the scores in the individual questions in both systems. According to the results of the experiment, the Use Case diagram seems to have the least effect on system comprehension, and this is also in agreement with the students' assessment of the Use Case diagram type contribution. In between are the Activity diagram and the State Machine diagram, which appear to have a positive effect, albeit not as high as the effect of the BDD.

As noted, the other goal of the experiment was to assess the quality of the OPM-to-SysML application in terms of errors and inconsistencies between the source OPM model and the generated SysML diagrams. In this regard, the students did not find any issues of errors, inconsistencies, or contradictions associated with the SysML diagrams, indicating that the application has achieved a high level of model-to-model translation fidelity.

In the study an algorithm for automatic SysML views generation from an OPM model was developed and applied. For each SysML view, a mapping scheme from OPM elements to SysML elements constitutes the foundation for the OPM-toSysML sub algorithm and translation engine application. The mappings are partial and do not utilize all the available language elements. The software implementation was OPCAT, the OPM-supporting modeling tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grobshtein |first1=Yariv |last2=Dori |first2=Dov |title=Generating SysML views from an OPM model: Design and evaluation |journal=SYSTEMS ENGINEERING |date=February 2011 |volume=14 |pages=327-340 |doi=10.1002/sys.20181 |accessdate=15 November 2018 |ref=SysMLtoOPMEval |publisher=International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) |url=https://doi.org/10.1002/sys.20181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pandemonia''' is a character and persona created as [[conceptual art]] by an anonymous London-based artist that has appeared in the art and fashion world since 2009.&lt;ref name="Stylist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet Pandemonia|url=http://www.stylist.co.uk/fashion/londonfashionweek/meet-pandemonia |work=[[Stylist (magazine)|Stylist]] |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clad in a latex full-head mask with stylized hair and latex dresses,&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt; Pandemonia is seven feet tall and was described by Katia Ganfield of ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' as "[[Roy Lichtenstein]]'s blonde caricatures ... brought to life as a 7 ft [[Jeff Koons]] inflatable".&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pandemonia|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/pandemonia-roy-lichtenstein-inflatable-seven-foot-tall- |work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |first=Katia |last=Ganfield |date=28 August 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is often accompanied by an inflatable white dog named Snowy.&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt;

Pandemonia told ''[[Stylist (magazine)|Stylist]]'':
{{Quote|Back in 2008 the newspapers were full of celebrities. I was drawn towards creating art that documented our time. It seemed evident to me that the best way to parody this world would be to create my very own celebrity. I created a truly artificial one, in the spirit of consumerist values. Slim, tall, glossy, forever young and, of course, famous.&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt;}}

Initially a "[[gate crashing|crasher]]" at fashion and social events, Pandemonia eventually became a [[London Fashion Week]] VIP guest.&lt;ref name="Stylist"/&gt;

Pandemonia is a critical reflection and, as such, an intervention upon ideas of celebrity and femininity.  She is a pointed manifestation of how these ideas intersect with mass media, social media, and the marketability of desire. The art of Pandemonia herself is that of a constructed figure placed in the landscape of media, fashion and art events that has instigated the media response by feeding back to the media its own language, imagery and ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Focus On: Pandemonia (Interview) |url=http://www.vogue.it/people-are-talking-about/focus-on/2012/03/pandemonia |work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue Italia]] |date=12 March 2012 |first=Susanna |last=Cappellaro |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=When I pop up in celebrity circles I can see the mechanism of fame from both the inside and outside. Just as celebrities presented their image to the public, I present the celebrities my image. At least I know I'm acting out celebrity. My dog, Snowy, breaks the ice. People relate to him. Funny how people relate to an inflatable dog, isn't it?|author=Pandemonia |source=&lt;ref name="Vice"/&gt;}}

The growth of Pandemonia's celebrity is one of the themes in her art, which also explores archetypes of pop myth and reality.&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;

Pandemonia’s art is not only cross-media (sculpture, digital art, photography, and performance), but also cross-generational as she ties the earliest moments of [[Pop Art]] to the most current worlds of celebrity, fashion and contemporary art, creating an arc and evolution which continues its ongoing exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oddamagazine.com/|title=ODDA Magazine Home Page|website=oddamagazine.com|access-date=2016-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Pandemonia was chosen by [[Camper (company)|Camper]] as the protagonist and muse for its Kobarah shoe style, and has been featured in stores and billboards in several major cities including Paris, London, New York, and Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Camper Celebrates Kobarah Shoe During Milan’s Salone Del Mobile|url=http://footwearnews.com/2016/fashion/designers/camper-kobarah-shoe-event-milan-salone-del-mobile-211601/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''phase change material''' ('''PCM''') is a substance with a high [[heat of fusion]] which, melting and solidifying at a certain temperature, is capable of storing and releasing large amounts of energy. Heat is absorbed or released when the material changes from solid to liquid and vice versa; thus, PCMs are classified as [[latent heat]] storage (LHS) units.

==Characteristics and classification==
Latent heat storage can be achieved through liquid→solid, solid→liquid, solid→gas and liquid→gas phase changes. However, only solid→liquid and liquid→solid phase changes are practical for PCMs. Although liquid–gas transitions have a higher heat of transformation than solid–liquid transitions, liquid→gas phase changes are impractical for thermal storage because large volumes or high pressures are required to store the materials in their gas phase. Solid–solid phase changes are typically very slow and have a relatively low heat of transformation.

Initially, solid–liquid PCMs behave like [[sensible heat]] storage (SHS) materials; their temperature rises as they absorb heat. Unlike conventional SHS materials, however, when PCMs reach the temperature at which they change phase (their melting temperature) they absorb large amounts of heat at an almost constant temperature. The PCM continues to absorb heat without a significant rise in temperature until all the material is transformed to the liquid phase. When the ambient temperature around a liquid material falls, the PCM solidifies, releasing its stored latent heat. A large number of PCMs are available in any required temperature range from −5 up to 190&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Kenisarin"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2006.05.005 |title=Solar energy storage using phase change materials |year=2007 |last1=Kenisarin |first1=M |last2=Mahkamov |first2=K |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=1913–1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the human comfort range between 20–30&amp;nbsp;°C, some PCMs are very effective. They store 5 to 14 times more heat per unit volume than conventional storage materials such as water, masonry or rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2007.10.005|title=Review on thermal energy storage with phase change materials and applications|year=2009|last1=Sharma|first1=Atul|last2=Tyagi|first2=V.V.|last3=Chen|first3=C.R.|last4=Buddhi|first4=D.|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=13|issue=2|pages=318–345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inorganic Eutectics ===
c-inorganic, inorganic-inorganic compounds
* Advantages
** Some inorganic eutectics have sharp melting point similar to pure substance.
** Volumetric storage density is slightly above organic compounds.
** Extra water principle can be used to avoid phase change degradation, involving dissolving the anhydrous salt during melting to result in a thickening of the liquid material so that it melts to a gel form; however, this can cause huge reduction in latent heat.
* Disadvantages
** They still have the same disadvantages as inorganic PCMs, such as reduced thermal performance upon cycling, corrosivity, high volume change, and high supercooling.
** Sharp crystals may form when the salt hydrate PCM solidifies, potentially causing leaks in cases of macro-encapsulation.
** Limited data is available on thermo-physical properties as the use of these materials is limited compared to organic PCMs.

=== Hygroscopic materials ===

Many natural building materials are hygroscopic, that is they can absorb (water condenses) and release water (water evaporates). The process is thus:
*Condensation (gas to liquid) ΔH&lt;0; enthalpy decreases (exothermic process) gives off heat.
*Vaporization (liquid to gas) ΔH&gt;0; enthalpy increases (endothermic process) absorbs heat (or cools).

Whilst this process liberates a small quantity of energy, large surfaces area allows significant (1–2&amp;nbsp;°C) heating or cooling in buildings. The corresponding materials are wool insulation, earth/clay render finishes,.

=== Solid-solid PCM materials ===

A specialised group of PCMs that undergo a solid/solid phase transition with the associated absorption and release of large amounts of heat. These materials change their crystalline structure from one lattice configuration to another at a fixed and well-defined temperature, and the transformation can involve latent heats comparable to the most effective solid/liquid PCMs. Such materials are useful because, unlike solid/liquid PCMs, they do not require nucleation to prevent supercooling. Additionally, because it is a solid/solid phase change, there is no visible change in the appearance of the PCM, and there are no problems associated with handling liquids, e.g. containment, potential leakage, etc. Currently the temperature range of solid-solid PCM solutions spans from -50&amp;nbsp;°C (-58&amp;nbsp;°F) up to +175&amp;nbsp;°C (347&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://phasechange.com/products/phasestor/|title=Phase Change Energy Solutions PhaseStor|last=|first=|date=|website=Phase Change Energy Solutions|access-date=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Small volume changes on phase transformation and small vapor pressure at operating temperatures to reduce the containment problem
* Congruent melting
* Kinetic properties
* High nucleation rate to avoid supercooling of the liquid phase
* High rate of crystal growth, so that the system can meet demands of heat recovery from the storage system

* No degradation after a large number of freeze/melt cycle
* Non-corrosiveness, non-toxic, non-flammable and non-explosive materials

==Technology, development and encapsulation==

The most commonly used PCMs are salt [[hydrate]]s&lt;!-- Only for housing applications? --&gt;, [[fatty acid]]s and [[ester]]s, and various [[Alkane|paraffin]]s (such as [[octadecane]]). Recently also [[ionic liquid]]s were investigated as novel PCMs.

As most of the organic solutions are water-free, they can be exposed to air, but all salt based PCM solutions must be encapsulated to prevent water evaporation or uptake. Both types offer certain advantages and disadvantages and if they are correctly applied some of the disadvantages becomes an advantage for certain applications.

They have been used since the late 19th century as a medium for the [[thermal storage]] applications. They have been used in such diverse applications as refrigerated transportation&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/3650.html Frederik Tudor the Ice King] on ice transport during the 19th century&lt;/ref&gt; for rail&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Trevithick]]'s steam locomotive ran in 1804&lt;/ref&gt; and road applications&lt;ref&gt;[[Amédée Bollée]] created [[steam car]]s beginning at 1873&lt;/ref&gt; and their physical properties are, therefore, well known.

Unlike the ice storage system, however, the PCM systems can be used with any conventional water [[chiller]] both for a new or alternatively retrofit application. The positive temperature phase change allows centrifugal and absorption chillers as well as the conventional reciprocating and screw chiller systems or even lower ambient conditions utilizing a [[cooling tower]] or dry cooler for charging the TES system.

The temperature range offered by the PCM technology provides a new horizon for the building services and refrigeration engineers regarding medium and high temperature energy storage applications. The scope of this thermal energy application is wide-ranging of solar heating, hot water, heating rejection, i.e. cooling tower and dry cooler circuitry thermal energy storage applications.

Since PCMs transform between solid–liquid in thermal cycling, encapsulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2005.10.002|title=PCM thermal storage in buildings: A state of art|year=2007|last1=Tyagi|first1=Vineet Veer|last2=Buddhi|first2=D.|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=11|issue=6|pages=1146–1166}}&lt;/ref&gt; naturally become the obvious storage choice.

*Encapsulation of PCMs
**Macro-encapsulation: Early development of macro-encapsulation with large volume containment failed due to the poor [[thermal conductivity]] of most PCMs. PCMs tend to solidify at the edges of the containers preventing effective heat transfer.
**Micro-encapsulation: [[Micro-encapsulation]] on the other hand showed no such problem. It allows the PCMs to be incorporated into construction materials, such as [[concrete]], easily and economically. Micro-encapsulated PCMs also provide a portable heat storage system. By coating a microscopic sized PCM with a protective coating, the particles can be [[suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] within a continuous phase such as water. This system can be considered a '''phase change [[slurry]]''' ('''PCS''').
**Molecular-encapsulation is another technology, developed by Dupont de Nemours that allows a very high concentration of PCM within a polymer compound. It allows storage capacity up to 515&amp;nbsp;[[Kilojoule|kJ]]/[[Square metre|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] for a 5&amp;nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]] board (103&amp;nbsp;[[Megajoule|MJ]]/[[Cubic metre|m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]). Molecular-encapsulation allows drilling and cutting through the material without any PCM leakage.

As phase change materials perform best in small containers, therefore they are usually divided in cells. The cells are shallow to reduce static head – based on the principle of shallow container geometry. The packaging material should conduct heat well; and it should be durable enough to withstand frequent changes in the storage material's volume as phase changes occur. It should also restrict the passage of water through the walls, so the materials will not dry out (or water-out, if the material is [[hygroscopic]]). Packaging must also resist leakage and [[corrosion]]. Common packaging materials showing chemical compatibility with room temperature PCMs include [[stainless steel]], [[polypropylene]] and [[polyolefin]].

==Thermal composites==

Thermal-composites is a term given to combinations of phase change materials (PCMs) and other (usually solid) structures. A simple example is a copper-mesh immersed in a paraffin-wax. The copper-mesh within parraffin-wax can be considered a composite material, dubbed a thermal-composite. Such hybrid materials are created to achieve specific overall or bulk properties.

Thermal conductivity is a common property which is targeted for maximisation by creating thermal composites. In this case the basic idea is to increase thermal conductivity by adding a highly conducting solid (such as the copper-mesh) into the relatively low conducting PCM thus increasing overall or bulk (thermal) conductivity. If the PCM is required to flow, the solid must be porous, such as a mesh.

Solid composites such as fibre-glass or kevlar-pre-preg for the aerospace industry usually refer to a fibre (the kevlar or the glass) and a matrix (the glue which solidifies to hold fibres and provide compressive strength). A thermal composite is not so clearly defined, but could similarly refer to a matrix (solid) and the PCM which is of course usually liquid and/or solid depending on conditions.
They are also meant to discover minor elements in the earth.

* [[Thermal protection]] of electronic devices
* Thermal protection of food: transport, hotel trade, ice-cream, etc.
* Textiles used in clothing
* [[Computer cooling]]
* Turbine Inlet Chilling with thermal energy storage
* Telecom shelters in tropical regions. They protect the high-value equipment in the shelter by keeping the indoor air temperature below the maximum permissible by absorbing heat generated by power-hungry equipment such as a [[Base Station Subsystem]]. In case of a power failure to conventional cooling systems, PCMs minimize use of [[diesel generator]]s, and this can translate into enormous savings across thousands of telecom sites in tropics.

==Fire and safety issues==
Some phase change materials are suspended in water, and are relatively nontoxic. Others are hydrocarbons or other flammable materials, or are toxic. As such, PCMs must be selected and applied very carefully, in accordance with fire and building codes and sound engineering practices. Because of the increased fire risk, flamespread, smoke, potential for explosion when held in containers, and liability, it may be wise not to use flammable PCMs within residential or other regularly occupied buildings. Phase change materials are also being used in thermal regulation of electronics.

{{redirect|Post-medieval|the period of European history following the Middle Ages|Renaissance}}
'''Post-medieval archaeology''' is a term used in Europe to describe the study of the material past over the last 500 years. Increasingly the field is referred to as [[Historical archaeology]], a term in international usage. It is closely related to [[Industrial archaeology]], although [[post-medieval]] archaeology conventionally has not extended its studies past the mid 18th century. Such a 'cut-off' date is increasingly critiqued by work within [[historical archaeology]] and [[contemporary archaeology]].

The traditional date for the beginning of the post-medieval period in Britain has been 1485 when, following the [[Battle of Bosworth]] the [[Tudor dynasty]] took the throne. In practice, the medieval period is now often extended into the reign of the Tudor monarchs and the boundary between the two eras is not precise. As with all attempts to divide the archaeological record into neat chunks, efforts to impose an exact date on the transition are doomed to be questioned by current and new findings.

Given the relatively strong historical record running alongside the archaeological one, post-medieval archaeology is often better positioned to study the effects of known social and political change. The immediacy of the period means that it appeals in fields such as [[genealogy]] as well as to students of [[social history]]. 

Post-medieval sites include [[Nonsuch Palace]] in [[Surrey]], [[The Rose (theatre)|The Rose Theatre]] in [[London]] and [[Fort Amherst]] in [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]].

A '''public participation geographic information system''' ('''PPGIS''') is meant to bring the academic practices of [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and mapping to the local level in order to promote knowledge production by local and non-governmental groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schuurman|first1=Nadine|title=GIS: A Short Introduction|date=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=USA, UK, Australia|isbn=978-0-631-23533-0|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind PPGIS is empowerment and inclusion of marginalized populations, who have little voice in the public arena, through geographic technology education and participation. PPGIS uses and produces digital maps, satellite imagery, sketch maps, and many other spatial and visual tools, to change geographic involvement and awareness on a local level. The term was coined in 1996 at the meetings of the [[National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis]] (NCGIA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schuurman|first1=Nadine|title=GIS: A Short Introduction|date=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=USA, UK, Australia|isbn=978-0-631-23533-0|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sieber, R. 2006. Public Participation and Geographic Information Systems: A Literature Review and Framework. ''Annals of the American Association of Geographers'', 96/3:491-507&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spatial.maine.edu/~schroedr/ppgis/ppgishom.html Public Participation GIS, NCGIA Workshop (Orono, Maine, US, 10–13 July 1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Attendees to the ''Mapping for Change International Conference on Participatory Spatial Information Management and Communication'' conferred to at least three potential implications of PPGIS; it can: (1) enhance capacity in generating, managing, and communicating spatial information; (2) stimulate innovation; and ultimately; (3) encourage positive social change.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, et al. 2006. [http://www.iied.org/NR/agbioliv/pla_notes/documents/NEWch01_overview_pp13-19.pdf Overview: Mapping for Change-the emergence of a new practice]. ''Participatory Learning and Action'', 54:13–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  This reflects on the rather nebulous definition of PPGIS as referenced in the ''Encyclopedia of GIS''&lt;ref&gt;Tulloch, D., 2008. "Public Participation GIS (PPGIS)," in K. Kemp (Eds.) ''Encyclopedia of GIS'': Sage Publications, p. 351-353.&lt;/ref&gt; which describes PPGIS as having a definition problem.

There are a range of applications for PPGIS. The potential outcomes can be applied from community and [[neighborhood planning]] and development to environmental and [[natural resource management]].  Marginalized groups, be they [[grassroots]] organizations to [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous populations]] could benefit from GIS technology.

Governments, [[Non-governmental organization|non-government organizations]] and [[Non-profit organization|non-profit groups]] are a big force behind many programs. The current extent of PPGIS programs in the US has been evaluated by Sawicki and Peterman.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, et al. 2002. ''Community Participation and Geographic Information Systems''. London: Taylor and Francis&lt;/ref&gt; They catalog over 60 PPGIS programs who aid in "public participation in community decision making by providing local-area data to community groups," in the United States (Craig et al., 2002:24).  The organizations providing these programs are mostly universities, local [[Chamber of commerce|chambers of commerce]], non-profit [[Foundation (charity)|foundations]].

In general, neighborhood empowerment groups can form and gain access to information that is normally very easy for the official government and planning offices to obtain.  It is easier for this to happen than for individuals of lower-income neighborhoods just working by themselves. There have been several projects where university students help implement GIS in neighborhoods and communities.  It is believed{{By whom|date=April 2010}} that access to information is the doorway to more effective government for everybody and community empowerment.  In a case study of a group in Milwaukee, residents of an [[inner city]] neighborhood became active participants in building a community information system, learning to access public information and create and analyze new databases derived from their own surveys, all with the purpose of making these residents useful actors in city management and in the formation of public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Ghose 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  In many cases, there are providers of data for community groups, but the groups may not know that such entities exist.  Getting the word out would be beneficial.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Some of the spatial data that the neighborhood wanted was information on abandoned or boarded-up buildings and homes, vacant lots, and properties that contained garbage, rubbish and debris that contributed to health and safety issues in the area.  They also appreciated being able to find landlords that were not keeping up the properties.  The university team and the community were able to build databases and make maps that would help them find these areas and perform the spatial analysis that they needed.  Community members learned how to use the computer resources, ArcView 1.0, and build a theme or land use map of the surrounding area.  They were able to perform spatial queries and analyze neighborhood problems.  Some of these problems included finding absentee landlords and finding code violations for the buildings on the maps (Ghose 2001).

==Approaches==
There are two approaches to PPGIS use and application. These two perspectives, top–down and bottom–up, are the currently debated schism in PPGIS.

===Top-down===
According to Sieber (2006), PPGIS was first envisioned as a means of mapping individuals by many social and economic demographic factors in order to analyze the spatial differences in access to social services.  She refers to this kind of PPGIS as ''top-down'', being that it is less hands on for the public, but theoretically serves the public by making adjustments for the deficiencies, and improvements in public management.&lt;ref&gt;Sieber, R. 2006. Public Participation and Geographic Information Systems: A Literature Review and Framework. ''Annals of the American Association of Geographers'', 96/3:491-507&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bottom-up===
A current trend with academic involvement in PPGIS, is researching existing programs, and or starting programs in order to collect data on the effectiveness of PPGIS.  Elwood (2006) in ''The Professional Geographer'', talks in depth about the "everyday inclusions, exclusions, and contradictions of Participatory GIS research."&lt;ref&gt;Elwood, S. 2006. Negotiating Knowledge Production: The Everyday Inclusions, Exclusions, and Contradictions of Participatory GIS Research. ''The Professional Geographer'', 58/2:197.&lt;/ref&gt;   The research is being conducted in order to evaluate if PPGIS is involving the public equally.  In reference to Sieber's top-down PPGIS, this is a counter method of PPGIS, rightly referred to as ''bottom-up'' PPGIS.  Its purpose is to work with the public to let them learn the technologies, then producing their own GIS.

Public participation GIS is defined by Sieber as the use of geographic information systems to broaden public involvement in policymaking as well as to the value of GIS to promote the goals of nongovernmental organizations, grassroots groups and community-based organizations (Sieber 2006).  It would seem on the surface that PPGIS, as it is commonly referred to, in this sense would be of a beneficial nature to those in the community or area that is being represented.  But in truth only certain groups or individuals will be able to obtain the technology and use it.  Is PPGIS becoming more available to the underprivileged sector of the community?  The question of "who benefits?" should always be asked, and does this harm a community or group of individuals.

The local, participatory management of urban neighborhoods usually follows on from 'claiming the territory', and has to be made compatible with national or local authority regulations on administering, managing and planning urban territory (McCall 2003). PPGIS applied to participatory community/neighborhood planning has been examined by, among many others, [Howard (1999)], [Carver, Evans, Kingston, and Turton (1999)], [Leitner, McMaster, Elwood, McMaster, and Sheppard (2002)], and [Talen (1999)]. Specific attention has been given to applications such as housing issues (e.g. [Elwood (2002)]) or neighborhood revitalization (e.g. [Craig &amp; Elwood (1998)]). Spatial databases along with the P-mapping are used to maintain a public records GIS or community land information systems (e.g. [Ventura, Niemann, Sutphin, &amp; Chenoweth (2002)]).  These are just a few of the uses of GIS in the community.

====Examples====

Public Participation in decision making processes works not only to identify areas of common values or variability, but also as an illustrative and instructional tool.  One example of effective dialogue and building trust between the community and decision makers comes from pre-planning for development in the United Kingdom.  It involves using GIS and [[multi-criteria decision analysis]] (MCDA) to make a decision about wind farm siting.  This method hinges upon taking all stakeholder perspectives into account to improve chances of reaching consensus .  This also creates a more transparent process and adds weight to the final decision by building upon traditional methods such as public meetings and hearings, surveys, focus groups, and deliberative processes enabling participants more insights and more informed opinions on environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;Higgs, G., Berry, R., Kidner, D, Langford, M. Using IT approaches to promote public participation in renewable energy planning: Prospects and challenges.  2008.  Land Use Policy 25, 596-607.&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative processes that consider objective and subjective inputs have the potential to efficiently address some of the conflict between development and nature as they involve a fuller justification by wind farm developers for location, scale, and design.  Spatial tools such as creation of 3D view sheds offer participants new ways of assessing visual intrusion to make a more informed decision.  Higgs et al. make a very telling statement when analyzing the success of this project – "the only way of accommodating people's landscape concerns is to site wind farms in places that people find more acceptable".  This implies that developers recognize the validity of citizens' concerns and are willing to compromise in identifying sites where wind farms will not only be successful financially, but also successful politically and socially.  This creates greater accountability and facilitates the incorporation of stakeholder values to resolve differences and gain public acceptance for vital development projects.

In another planning example, Simao et al. analyzed how to create sustainable development options with widespread community support.  They determined that stakeholders need to learn likely outcomes that result from stated preferences, which can be supported through enhanced access to information and incentives to increase public participation.  Through a multi-criteria spatial [[decision support system]] stakeholders were able to voice concerns and work on a compromise solution to have final outcome accepted by majority when siting wind farms.  This differs from the work of Higgs et al. in that the focus was on allowing users to learn from the collaborative process, both interactively and iteratively about the nature of the problem and their own preferences for desirable characteristics of solution.

This stimulated sharing of opinions and discussion of interests behind preferences.  After understanding the problem more fully, participants could discuss alternative solutions and interact with other participants to come to a compromise solution.&lt;ref&gt;Simao, A., Densham, P.J., Haklay, M.  Web-based GIS for collaborative planning and public participation: An application to the strategic planning of wind farm sites.  2009, Journal of Environmental Management, 90, 2027-2040&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar work has been done to incorporate public participation in spatial planning for transportation system development,&lt;ref&gt;Zhong, E.

Computers, Environment, and Urban Systems 32 (2008) 123–133&lt;/ref&gt; and this method of two-way benefits is even beginning to move towards web-based mapping services to further simplify and extend the process into the community.&lt;ref&gt;Kingston, R.

{{Wiktionary|rapport}}
'''Rapport''' is a close and harmonious relationship in which the people or groups concerned are “in sync” with each other, understand each other's feelings or ideas, and communicate smoothly.

The word stems from the old French verb ''rapporter'' which means literally to carry something back;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Manser |first1=Martin |last2=Turton |first2=Nigel |title=Advanced Learners Dictionary |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |year=1998 |isbn=1-85326-763-5 |page=574 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rapport |title= Rapport – Definition |publisher= Merriam Webster |accessdate= 22 Mar 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the sense of how people relate to each other means that what one person sends out the other sends back. For example, they may realize that they share similar values, beliefs, knowledge, or behaviors around politics, music or sports.&lt;ref name="KatzSweedler2010"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Neil H. Katz |author2=Marcia Koppelman Sweedler |author3=John W. Lawyer |title=Communication &amp; Conflict Resolution Skills |url=https://he.kendallhunt.com/sites/default/files/uploadedFiles/Kendall_Hunt/Content/Higher_Education/Uploads/Katz_TOC_2e.pdf |date=6 December 2010 |publisher=Kendall Hunt Publishing Company |isbn=978-0-7575-7875-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may also mean that the participants engage in reciprocal behaviors such as posture mirroring or in increased coordination in their verbal and nonverbal interactions.&lt;ref name="Psychological Inquiry"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tickle-Degnen |first1=Linda |last2=Rosenthal |first2=Robert |title=The Nature of Rapport and Its Nonverbal Correlates |url=http://www.justinecassell.com/discourse07/week3/TickleDegnenRosenthal_NatureofRapport.pdf |journal=Psychological Inquiry |date=1990 |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=285–293 |doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0104_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of techniques that are supposed to be beneficial in building rapport such as: matching your [[body language]] (i.e., [[Human position|posture]], [[gesture]], etc.);&lt;ref name="Psychological Inquiry"/&gt; indicating attentiveness through maintaining [[eye contact]];&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zhao |first1=Ran |last2=Papangelis |first2=Alexandros |last3=Cassell |first3=Justine |chapter=Towards a Dyadic Computational Model of Rapport Management for Human-Virtual Agent Interaction |chapter-url=http://www.articulab.justinecassell.com/publications/Zhao,%20Papangelis,%20Cassell%20IVA2014.pdf |title=Intelligent Virtual Agents |date=2014 |pages=514–527 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-09767-1_62 |isbn=978-3-319-09767-1 |editor1-last=Bickmore |editor1-first=T. |editor2-last=Marsella |editor2-first=S. |editor3-last=Sidner |editor3-first=C. |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=8637 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and matching [[breath]]ing [[rhythm]] {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}. In conversation, some verbal behaviors associated with increased rapport are the use of positivity (or, positive "face management"), sharing personal information of gradually increasing intimacy (or, "[[self-disclosure]]"), and by referring to shared interests or experiences.&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt;

Rapport has been shown to have benefits for psychotherapy and medicine,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Falkenström |first1=F |last2=Hatcher |first2=R |last3=Skjulsvik |first3=T |last4=Larsson |first4=M |last5=Holmqvist |first5=R |title=Development and Validation of a 6-item Working Alliance Psychotherapy |url=http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:802104/FULLTEXT01.pdf |journal=Psychological Assessment |date=2014 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=169–83 |doi=10.1037/pas0000038 |pmid=25346997}}&lt;/ref&gt; negotiation,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Drolet |first1=Aimee |last2=Morris |first2=Michael |title=Rapport in Conflict Resolution: Accounting for How Face-to-Face Contact Fosters Mutual Cooperation in Mixed-Motive Conflict |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/336e/291572583c58c0209c3dd7d374ee0927dcad.pdf |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |date=2000 |volume=36 |pages=25–30 |doi=10.1006/jesp.1999.1395}}&lt;/ref&gt; and education,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frisby |first1=Brandi |last2=Martin |first2=Matthew |title=Instructor–Student and Student–Student Rapport in the Classroom |journal=Communication Education |date=2010 |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=146 |doi=10.1080/03634520903564362}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others. In each of these cases, the rapport between members of a dyad (e.g. a teacher and student or doctor and patient) allows the participants to coordinate their actions and establish a mutually beneficial working relationship, or what is often called a “working alliance”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Building ==
To achieve the benefits of interpersonal rapport in domains like education, medicine, or even sales, several methods have been shown to build rapport between people. These methods include coordination, showing your attentiveness to the other, building commonality, and managing the other's self-perception (also called "face" management).&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt;

=== Methods ===

==== Coordination ====
Coordination, also called "mirroring"&lt;ref name="Psychological Inquiry"/&gt; means getting into rhythm with another person, or coordinating one's verbal or nonverbal behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Building Rapport |last=Graham |first=Colly |url=http://www.evancarmichael.com/Sales/3151/Building-Rapport--Customer-Relationships.html |accessdate=2010-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Emotional mirroring''' – Empathizing with someone's emotional state by being on 'their side'. You must apply the skill of being a good listener in this situation so as you can listen for key words and problems that arise when speaking with the person. This is so you can talk about these issues and question them to better your understanding of what they are saying and show your empathy towards them (Arnold, E and Boggs, josh. 2007).
* '''Posture mirroring''' – Matching the tone of a person's body language not through direct imitation, as this can appear as mockery, but through mirroring the general message of their posture and energy.
* '''Tone and tempo mirroring''' – Matching the tone, tempo, inflection, and volume of a person's voice.

==== Mutual attentiveness ====
Another way of building rapport is by each partner indicating their attentiveness to the other.&lt;ref name="Psychological Inquiry"/&gt; This attentiveness may take the form of nonverbal attentiveness, such as looking at the other person,&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt; nodding at appropriate moments, or physical proximity, as seen in work on teachers' "immediacy" behaviors in the classroom.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; This attentiveness might also be demonstrated through reciprocation of nonverbal behaviors like smiling or nodding, similar to the coordination&lt;ref name="Psychological Inquiry"/&gt; or in the reciprocal sharing of personal details about the other person that signal one's knowledge and attentiveness to their needs.&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt;

==== Commonality ====
Commonality is the technique of deliberately finding something in common with a person or a customer in order to build a sense of camaraderie and trust.
This is done through references to shared interests, dislikes, and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Establish trust and rapport |last=DeGroot |first=Bob |url=http://www.saleshelp.com/guestservices/destinations/newsletter/step7trustrapport.htm|accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; By sharing personal details or self-disclosing personal preferences or information, interlocutors can build commonality, and thus increase rapport.&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt;

==== Face management ====
Another way of building rapport is through what is often referred to as "positive face management",&lt;ref name="Politeness Research"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spencer-Oatey|first1=Helen|title=(Im)Politeness, Face and Perceptions of Rapport: Unpackaging their Bases and Interrelationships|journal=Politeness Research|date=2005|volume=1|issue=1|pages=95–119|doi=10.1515/jplr.2005.1.1.95}}&lt;/ref&gt; but may also simply be called positivity. According to some psychologists,&lt;ref name="Politeness Research"/&gt; we have a need to be seen in a positive light, known as our "face". By managing each other's "face", boosting it when necessary, or reducing negative impacts to it, we are able to build rapport with others.&lt;ref name="Politeness Research"/&gt;

==Benefits==
There have been a number of proposed benefits from building interpersonal rapport, which all revolve around smoother interactions, improved collaboration, and improved interpersonal outcomes,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; though the specifics differ by the domain.

In the medical domain, doctor-patient rapport is often called the "Working Alliance", and is a measure of the collaboration quality between doctor (or therapist) and patient, often used as a predictor of therapy outcomes or patients' prescription adherence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In education, teacher-student rapport is predictive of students' participation in the course, their course retention, likelihood to take a course in that domain again, and has sometimes been used to predict course outcomes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Some have argued that teacher-student rapport is an essential element of what makes an effective teacher, or the ability to manage interpersonal relationships and build a positive, pro-social, atmosphere of trust and reduced anxiety.&lt;ref name="Teaching of Psychology"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=Daniel|title=Further Validation of the Learning Alliance Inventory: The Roles of Working Alliance, Rapport, and Immediacy in Student Learning|journal=Teaching of Psychology|date=2015|volume=42|issue=1|pages=19|doi=10.1177/0098628314562673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student-student rapport, on the other hand, while largely out of the teacher's ability to control, is also predictive of reduced anxiety in the course, feelings of a supportive class culture, and improved participation in class discussions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

In negotiation, rapport is beneficial for reaching mutually beneficial outcomes,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; as partners are more likely to trust each other and be willing to cooperate and reach a positive outcome. However, others have found that interpersonal rapport in negotiation can lead to unethical behavior, particularly in impasse situations, where the interpersonal rapport may influence the negotiators to behave unethically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jap|first1=Sandy|last2=Robertson|first2=Diana|last3=Hamilton|first3=Ryan|title=The Dark Side of Rapport: Agent Misbehavior Face-to-Face and Online|journal=Management Science|date=2011|volume=57|issue=9|pages=1610–1622|doi=10.1287/mnsc.1110.1359|ssrn=1789782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studying==
To better study how rapport can lead to the above benefits, researchers generally adopt one of three main approaches: self-report surveys given to the participants,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; third-party observations from a naive observer,&lt;ref name="Psychological Inquiry"/&gt; and some form of automated computational detection, using computer vision and machine learning.&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt;

Self-report surveys typically consist of a set of questions given at the end of the interaction, asking the participants to reflect on their relationship with another person and rate various aspects of that relationship, typically on a Likert scale.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Though this is the most common approach, it suffers from unreliability of self-report data, such as the issue of separating participants' reflection on a single interaction with their relationship with the other person more broadly.&lt;ref name="Teaching of Psychology"/&gt;

To address these issues, others have used a third-party observer to give a rating of the rapport to a particular segment of the interaction, often called a "slice".&lt;ref name="Psychological Inquiry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt; Other recent work uses techniques from computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to computationally detect the level of rapport between members of a dyad.&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt;

A '''split screen''' is a display technique in [[computer graphics]] that consists of dividing graphics and/or text into non-movable adjacent parts, typically two or four [[rectangle|rectangular]] areas.  This is done in order to allow the simultaneous presentation of (usually) related graphical and textual information on a [[computer display]]. Split screen differs from [[windowing system]]s in that the latter allows overlapping and freely movable parts of the screen (the "[[Window (computing)|windows]]") to present related as well as unrelated application data to the user, while the former conforms more strictly to the description given in the paragraph above.

The split screen technique can also be used to run two instances of an application, possibly with another user interacting with the other instance.

==In video games==
The split screen feature is commonly used in non-[[Computer network|networked]] [[video game]]s with [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] options.  

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Hii.jpg|thumb|right|A split screen for four players, all playing [[Call of Duty 2]] simultaneously on the same screen]] --&gt;
In its most easily  understood form, a split screen for a two-player video game is an audiovisual output device (usually a standard [[television]] for [[video game console]]s) where the display has been divided into two equally sized areas so that the players can explore different areas simultaneously without being close to each other.  This has historically been remarkably popular on consoles, which until the 2000s did not have access to the [[Internet]] or any other network.

Split screen is useful for people who want to play with other players, but with only one console.
In recent years, split screen hasn't been used very often because the new frontier of videogames is playing with other players [[Multiplayer online game|online]], without screen sharing.

== Advantages and disadvantages of split screen in video games ==

===Advantages===
*Users can see where the other players are
*Users can communicate with the players who are near them
*Only one Console needed
*Only one Game Copy needed

===Disadvantages===
*Small screens
*User can cheat by looking at the other players' screens, also called 'screen-cheating' or 'screen-peeking'.
*Rendering more screens taxes the hardware, often reducing [[frame rate]] or graphical detail.
*More distraction.
&lt;!-- commented out as it is non-notable: [[Microsoft]] is researching the split-screen concept for PCs.[http://www.engadget.com/2007/05/06/microsoft-researching-split-screen-desktop-software/] --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4362">The '''Swedish Institute in Rome''' ({{lang-sv|Svenska Institutet i Rom}}, {{lang-it|Istituto Svedese di studi classici a Roma}}) is a research institution that serves as the base for archaeological excavations and other scientific research in [[Italy]]. It also pursues academic instruction in [[archaeology]] and art sciences as well as arranging conferences with themes of interest to the institute. The Institute has at its disposal a building in central [[Rome]] with a relatively well-supplied library, archaeological laboratory and around twenty rooms and smaller apartments for the use of visiting researchers and holders of scholarships.

The institute was founded in 1925 by, among others, King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]], then Crown Prince of [[Sweden]].

==Excavations==
The Institute has conducted several major excavations. Before [[World War II]], excavations were carried out on the [[Forum Romanum]] among other places, but since then most of them have taken place in southern [[Etruria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isvroma.it/public/NEW/English/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=55 Istituto Svedese di studi classici a Roma - History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309011435/http://www.isvroma.it/public/New/English/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=55 |date=2017-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TAROT''' ({{lang-fr|Télescope à Action Rapide pour les Objets Transitoires|links=no}}, "Quick-action telescope for transient objects") is a project of the [[European Southern Observatory]] (ESO) aimed at rapidly reacting to particular data from other [[Astronomical survey|astronomical surveying facilities]] to monitor for and registering fast changing [[astronomical objects]] and phenomena. The target of this particular project is so-called [[gamma-ray burst]]s (GRB).&lt;ref name="TAROT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/lasilla/tarot/ |title=Télescope à Action Rapide pour les Objets Transitoires |author=information@eso.org |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''TAROT-South facility''' is a 25 cm very fast moving optical [[robotic telescope]] at the [[La Silla Observatory]] in Chile.

Taxonomic inflation is often claimed to occur for [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] reasons.

[[File:Roots blower - 2 lobes.svg|thumb|right|The [[Roots blower]] is one example of a vacuum pump]]

A '''vacuum pump''' is a device that removes gas molecules from a sealed volume in order to leave behind a partial [[vacuum]].  The first vacuum pump was invented in 1650 by [[Otto von Guericke]], and was preceded by the [[Vacuum pump#History|suction pump]], which dates to antiquity.

== History ==
[[Image:HiVacuumApparatus-Tesla.png|thumb|333px|Tesla's vacuum apparatus, published in 1892]]

The predecessor to the vacuum [[pump]] was the '''[[suction]] pump''', which was known to the Romans. Dual-action suction pumps were found in the city of [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imss.fi.it/pompei/tecnica/epompa.html|title=Pompeii: Technology: Working models: IMSS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic engineer [[Al-Jazari]] also described suction pumps in the 13th century. He said that his model was a larger version of the [[siphons]] the Byzantines used to discharge the [[Greek fire]].&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt; The suction pump later reappeared in Europe from the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]] (1996), ''A History of Engineering in Classical and Medieval Times'', [[Routledge]], pp. 143 &amp; 150-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hill2&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]], "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''Scientific American'', May 1991, pp. 64-69 ([[cf.]] [[Donald Routledge Hill]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110101193750/http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm Mechanical Engineering])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ahmad Y Hassan |title=The Origin of the Suction Pump: Al-Jazari 1206 A.D |url=http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%202.htm |accessdate=2008-07-16 |authorlink=Ahmad Y Hassan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226102543/http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%202.htm |archivedate=February 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Molchanova by levitskiy.jpg|thumb|Student of [[Smolny Institute]] Catherine Molchanova with vacuum pump, by [[Dmitry Levitzky]], 1776]]
By the 17th century, water pump designs had improved to the point that they produced measurable vacuums, but this was not immediately understood. What was known was that suction pumps could not pull water beyond a certain height: 18 Florentine yards according to a measurement taken around 1635. (The conversion to metres is uncertain, but it would be about 9 or 10 metres.) This limit was a concern to irrigation projects, mine drainage, and decorative water fountains planned by the Duke of [[Tuscany]], so the duke commissioned [[Galileo]] to investigate the problem. Galileo advertised the puzzle to other scientists, including [[Gasparo Berti]] who replicated it by building the first water barometer in Rome in 1639.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denmark.com.au/en/Worlds+Largest+Barometer/default.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216140317/http://www.denmark.com.au/en/Worlds+Largest+Barometer/default.htm |archivedate=2008-02-16 |title=The World's Largest Barometer |accessdate=2008-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Berti's barometer produced a vacuum above the water column, but he could not explain it. The breakthrough was made by [[Evangelista Torricelli]] in 1643.  Building upon Galileo's notes, he built the first [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] [[barometer]] and wrote a convincing argument that the space at the top was a vacuum. The height of the column was then limited to the maximum weight that atmospheric pressure could support; this is the limiting height of a [[suction pump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Calvert|2000|loc="[http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/tech/fluids/hydstat.htm#Maxh Maximum height to which water can be raised by a suction pump]"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1654, [[Otto von Guericke]] invented the first vacuum pump and conducted his famous [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] experiment, showing that teams of horses could not separate two hemispheres from which the air had been evacuated. [[Robert Boyle]] improved Guericke's design and conducted experiments on the properties of vacuum. [[Robert Hooke]] also helped Boyle produce an air pump which helped to produce the vacuum. The study of vacuum then lapsed{{Dubious|date=September 2011}} until 1855, when [[Heinrich Geissler]] invented the mercury displacement pump and achieved a record vacuum of about 10&amp;nbsp;Pa (0.1 [[Torr]]). A number of electrical properties become observable at this vacuum level, and this renewed interest in vacuum. This, in turn, led to the development of the [[vacuum tube]].

In the 19th century, [[Nikola Tesla]] designed an apparatus that contains a [[Sprengel pump]] to create a high degree of exhaustion.

== Types ==
Pumps can be broadly categorized according to three techniques:&lt;ref name="VCH"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Van Atta | first = C. M. |author2=M. Hablanian | editor = Rita G. Lerner | editor2 = George L. Trigg | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Physics | title = Vacuum and Vacuum Technology | edition = Second | date = 1991 | publisher = VCH Publishers Inc. | pages = 1330–1333 | isbn = 978-3-527-26954-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive displacement pumps use a mechanism to repeatedly expand a cavity, allow gases to flow in from the chamber, seal off the cavity, and exhaust it to the atmosphere. Momentum transfer pumps, also called molecular pumps, use high speed jets of dense fluid or high speed rotating blades to knock gas molecules out of the chamber. Entrapment pumps capture gases in a solid or adsorbed state. This includes [[cryopump]]s, [[getter]]s, and [[Ion pump (physics)|ion pump]]s.

Positive displacement pumps are the most effective for low vacuums. Momentum transfer pumps in conjunction with one or two positive displacement pumps are the most common configuration used to achieve high vacuums.  In this configuration the positive displacement pump serves two purposes.  First it obtains a rough vacuum in the vessel being evacuated before the momentum transfer pump can be used to obtain the high vacuum, as momentum transfer pumps cannot start pumping at atmospheric pressures.  Second the positive displacement pump backs up the momentum transfer pump by evacuating to low vacuum the accumulation of displaced molecules in the high vacuum pump.  Entrapment pumps can be added to reach ultrahigh vacuums, but they require periodic regeneration of the surfaces that trap air molecules or ions.  Due to this requirement their available operational time can be unacceptably short in low and high vacuums, thus limiting their use to ultrahigh vacuums. Pumps also differ in details like manufacturing tolerances, sealing material, pressure, flow, admission or no admission of oil vapor, service intervals, reliability, tolerance to dust, tolerance to chemicals, tolerance to liquids and vibration.

=== Positive displacement pump===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Vacuum]] --&gt;
[[Image:L-Pumpe2.png|thumb|The manual water pump draws water up from a well by creating a vacuum that water rushes in to fill. In a sense, it acts to evacuate the well, although the high leakage rate of dirt prevents a high quality vacuum from being maintained for any length of time.]]
[[Image:Two moving spirals scroll pump.gif|frame|Mechanism of a scroll pump]]

A partial vacuum may be generated by increasing the volume of a container. To continue evacuating a chamber indefinitely without requiring infinite growth, a compartment of the vacuum can be repeatedly closed off, exhausted, and expanded again. This is the principle behind a '''positive displacement pump''', for example the manual water pump. Inside the pump, a mechanism expands a small sealed cavity to reduce its pressure below that of the atmosphere. Because of the pressure differential, some fluid from the chamber (or the well, in our example) is pushed into the pump's small cavity. The pump's cavity is then sealed from the chamber, opened to the atmosphere, and squeezed back to a minute size.

More sophisticated systems are used for most industrial applications, but the basic principle of cyclic volume removal is the same:
* [[Rotary vane pump]], the most common
* [[Diaphragm pump]], zero oil contamination
* [[Liquid ring]] high resistance to dust 
* [[Reciprocating compressor|Piston pump]], fluctuating vacuum
* [[Scroll compressor|Scroll pump]], highest speed dry pump
* [[Archimedes' screw|Screw pump]] (10 Pa)
* [[Wankel]] pump
* External vane pump
* [[Roots blower]], also called a booster pump, has highest pumping speeds but low compression ratio
* Multistage Roots pump that combine several stages providing high pumping speed with better compression ratio
* [[Toepler pump]]
* [[Lobe pump]]

The base pressure of a [[rubber]]- and [[plastic]]-sealed piston pump system is typically 1 to 50 kPa, while a scroll pump might reach 10 Pa (when new) and a rotary vane oil pump with a clean and empty metallic chamber can easily achieve 0.1 Pa.

A positive displacement vacuum pump moves the same [[volume]] of gas with each cycle, so its pumping speed is constant unless it is overcome by backstreaming.

=== Momentum transfer pump===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Vacuum]] --&gt;
[[Image:Cut through turbomolecular pump.jpg|thumb|A cutaway view of a turbomolecular high vacuum pump]]
In a '''momentum transfer pump''', gas molecules are accelerated from the vacuum side to the exhaust side (which is usually maintained at a reduced pressure by a positive displacement pump). Momentum transfer pumping is only possible below pressures of about 0.1 kPa. Matter flows differently at different pressures based on the laws of [[fluid dynamics]]. At atmospheric pressure and mild vacuums, molecules interact with each other and push on their neighboring molecules in what is known as viscous flow. When the distance between the molecules increases, the molecules interact with the walls of the chamber more often than with the other molecules, and molecular pumping becomes more effective than positive displacement pumping. This regime is generally called high vacuum.

Molecular pumps sweep out a larger area than mechanical pumps, and do so more frequently, making them capable of much higher pumping speeds. They do this at the expense of the seal between the vacuum and their exhaust. Since there is no seal, a small pressure at the exhaust can easily cause backstreaming through the pump; this is called stall. In high vacuum, however, pressure gradients have little effect on fluid flows, and molecular pumps can attain their full potential.

The two main types of molecular pumps are the [[diffusion pump]] and the [[turbomolecular pump]]. Both types of pumps blow out gas molecules that diffuse into the pump by imparting momentum to the gas molecules. Diffusion pumps blow out gas molecules with jets of oil or mercury, while turbomolecular pumps use high speed fans to push the gas. Both of these pumps will stall and fail to pump if exhausted directly to atmospheric pressure, so they must be exhausted to a lower grade vacuum created by a mechanical pump.

As with positive displacement pumps, the base pressure will be reached when leakage, [[outgassing]], and [[backstreaming]] equal the pump speed, but now minimizing leakage and outgassing to a level comparable to backstreaming becomes much more difficult.

=== Regenerative pump ===
Regenerative pumps utilize vortex behavior of the fluid (air). The construction is based on hybrid concept of [[centrifugal pump]] and turbopump. Usually it consists of several sets of perpendicular teeth on the rotor circulating air molecules inside stationary hollow grooves like multistage centrifugal pump.  They can reach to 1×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; mbar (0.001 Pa)(when combining with Holweck pump) and directly exhaust to atmospheric pressure. Examples of such pumps are Edwards EPX &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardsvacuum.com/Products/List.aspx?r=32|title=EPX on-tool High Vacuum Pumps|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (technical paper &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915114706/http://edwardsvacuum.com/uploadedFiles/Resource/Technical_Articles/Toward+the+Single+Pumping+Solution.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=15 September 2013|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Pfeiffer OnTool™ Booster 150.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pfeiffer-vacuum.com/products/side-channel-pumps/container.action|title=Side Channel Pump, Vacuum pump for High-vacuum - Pfeiffer Vacuum|author=Pfeiffer Vacuum|website=Pfeiffer Vacuum|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401112132/http://www.pfeiffer-vacuum.com/products/side-channel-pumps/container.action|archivedate=2013-04-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred as side channel pump. Due to high pumping rate from atmosphere to high vacuum and less contamination since bearing can be installed at exhaust side, this type of pumps are used in load lock in semiconductor manufacturing processes.

This type of pump suffers from high power consumption(~1&amp;nbsp;kW) compare to turbomolecular pump (&lt;100W) at low pressure since most power is consumed to back atmospheric pressure. This can be reduced by nearly 10 times by backing with a small pump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Vacuum |volume= 85 |issue= 12 |year= 2011 | pages= 1174–1177 |title= High vacuum side channel pump working against atmosphere |first1= A. |last1= Shirinov |first2= S. |last2= Oberbeck | doi=10.1016/j.vacuum.2010.12.018|bibcode= 2011Vacuu..85.1174S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entrapment pump===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Vacuum]] --&gt;
An '''entrapment pump''' may be a [[cryopump]], which uses [[cryogenic|cold]] temperatures to condense gases to a solid or adsorbed state, a chemical pump, which reacts with gases to produce a solid residue, or an [[Ion pump (physics)|ion pump]], which uses strong electrical fields to ionize gases and propel the ions into a solid substrate. A [[cryomodule]] uses cryopumping. Other types are the [[sorption pump]], non-evaporative [[getter]] pump, and [[titanium sublimation pump]] (a type of evaporative getter that can be used repeatedly).

=== Other types ===
*Venturi vacuum pump ([[Aspirator (pump)|aspirator]]) (10 to 30 kPa)
*[[Injector|Steam ejector]] (vacuum depends on the number of stages, but can be very low)

== Performance measures ==
Pumping speed refers to the volume flow rate of a pump at its inlet, often measured in volume per unit of time.  Momentum transfer and entrapment pumps are more effective on some gases than others, so the pumping rate can be different for each of the gases being pumped, and the average volume flow rate of the pump will vary depending on the chemical composition of the gases remaining in the chamber.

Throughput refers to the pumping speed multiplied by the gas pressure at the inlet, and is measured in units of pressure·volume/unit time. At a constant temperature, throughput is proportional to the number of molecules being pumped per unit time, and therefore to the [[mass flow rate]] of the pump. When discussing a leak in the system or backstreaming through the pump, throughput refers to the volume leak rate multiplied by the pressure at the vacuum side of the leak, so the leak throughput can be compared to the pump throughput.

Positive displacement and momentum transfer pumps have a constant volume flow rate (pumping speed), but as the chamber's [[pressure]] drops, this volume contains less and less mass. So although the pumping speed remains constant, the throughput and [[mass flow rate]] drop exponentially. Meanwhile, the leakage, [[evaporation]], [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]] and backstreaming rates continue to produce a constant throughput into the system.

== Techniques ==
Vacuum pumps are combined with chambers and operational procedures into a wide variety of vacuum systems. Sometimes more than one pump will be used (in [[Series circuits|series]] or in [[Parallel circuits|parallel]]) in a single application. A partial vacuum, or rough vacuum, can be created using a positive displacement pump that transports a gas load from an inlet port to an outlet (exhaust) port. Because of their mechanical limitations, such pumps can only achieve a low vacuum. To achieve a higher vacuum, other techniques must then be used, typically in series (usually following an initial fast pump down with a positive displacement pump). Some examples might be use of an oil sealed rotary vane pump (the most common positive displacement pump) backing a diffusion pump, or a dry scroll pump backing a turbomolecular pump.  There are other combinations depending on the level of vacuum being sought.

Achieving high vacuum is difficult because all of the materials exposed to the vacuum must be carefully evaluated for their [[outgassing]] and [[vapor pressure]] properties. For example, oils, [[grease (lubricant)|grease]]s, and [[rubber]] or [[plastic]] [[gasket]]s used as [[seal (mechanical)|seal]]s for the vacuum chamber must not [[Boiling point|boil]] off when exposed to the vacuum, or the gases they produce would prevent the creation of the desired degree of vacuum. Often, all of the surfaces exposed to the vacuum must be baked at high temperature to drive off [[adsorption|adsorbed]] gases.

Outgassing can also be reduced simply by [[desiccation]] prior to vacuum pumping.
High vacuum systems generally require metal chambers with metal gasket seals such as Klein flanges or ISO flanges, rather than the rubber gaskets more common in low vacuum chamber seals. The system must be clean and free of organic matter to minimize outgassing. All materials, solid or liquid, have a small vapour pressure, and their outgassing becomes important when the vacuum pressure falls below this vapour pressure. As a result, many materials that work well in low vacuums, such as [[epoxy]], will become a source of outgassing at higher vacuums.
With these standard precautions, vacuums of 1 mPa are easily achieved with an assortment of molecular pumps. With careful design and operation, 1 µPa is possible.

Several types of pumps may be used in sequence or in parallel. In a typical pumpdown sequence, a positive displacement pump would be used to remove most of the gas from a chamber, starting from atmosphere (760 [[Torr]], 101 kPa) to 25 Torr (3 kPa). Then a sorption pump would be used to bring the pressure down to 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; Torr (10 mPa). A cryopump or turbomolecular pump would be used to bring the pressure further down to 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; Torr (1 µPa). An additional ion pump can be started below 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; Torr to remove gases which are not adequately handled by a cryopump or turbo pump, such as [[helium]] or [[hydrogen]].

[[Ultra high vacuum]] generally requires custom-built equipment, strict operational procedures, and a fair amount of trial-and-error. Ultra-high vacuum systems are usually made of [[stainless steel]] with metal-gasketed [[vacuum flange]]s. The system is usually baked, preferably under vacuum, to temporarily raise the vapour pressure of all outgassing materials in the system and boil them off. If necessary, this outgassing of the system can also be performed at room temperature, but this takes much more time. Once the bulk of the outgassing materials are boiled off and evacuated, the system may be cooled to lower vapour pressures to minimize residual outgassing during actual operation. Some systems are cooled well below room temperature by [[liquid nitrogen]] to shut down residual outgassing and simultaneously cryopump the system.

In ultra-high vacuum systems, some very odd leakage paths and outgassing sources must be considered. The water absorption of [[aluminium]] and [[palladium]] becomes an unacceptable source of outgassing, and even the absorptivity of hard metals such as stainless steel or [[titanium]] must be considered. Some oils and greases will boil off in extreme vacuums. The porosity of the metallic [[vacuum chamber]] walls may have to be considered, and the grain direction of the metallic flanges should be parallel to the flange face.

The impact of molecular size must be considered. Smaller molecules can leak in more easily and are more easily absorbed by certain materials, and molecular pumps are less effective at pumping gases with lower molecular weights. A system may be able to evacuate nitrogen (the main component of air) to the desired vacuum, but the chamber could still be full of residual atmospheric hydrogen and helium. Vessels lined with a highly gas-permeable material such as [[palladium]] (which is a high-capacity [[hydrogen]] sponge) create special outgassing problems.

==Applications==
Vacuum pumps are used in many industrial and scientific processes including composite plastic moulding processes, production of most types of [[lighting|electric lamps]], [[vacuum tube]]s, and [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]s where the device is either left evacuated or re-filled with a specific gas or gas mixture, [[semiconductor]] processing, notably [[ion implantation]], dry etch and PVD, ALD, PECVD and CVD deposition and so on in [[photolithography]], [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]], medical processes that require suction, [[uranium enrichment]], medical applications such as [[radiotherapy]], [[radiosurgery]] and [[radiopharmacy]], analytical instrumentation to analyse gas, liquid, solid, surface and bio materials, [[mass spectrometer]]s to create a high vacuum between the ion source and the detector, vacuum coating on glass, metal and plastics for decoration, for durability and for energy saving, such as [[low-emissivity]] glass, hard coating for engine components (as in [[Formula One]]), ophthalmic coating, [[milking machine]]s and other equipment in dairy sheds, vacuum impregnation of porous products such as wood or electric motor windings, air conditioning service (removing all contaminants from the system before charging with refrigerant), trash compactor,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} [[vacuum engineering]], [[sewage system]]s (see EN1091:1997 standards), [[freeze drying]], and [[Fusion power|fusion]] research. In the field of oil regeneration and rerefining, vacuum pumps create a low vacuum for oil dehydration and a high vacuum for oil purification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Speight|first1=James|last2=Exall|first2=Douglas|title=Refining Used Lubricating Oils|date=2014|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|location=Boca Raton|isbn=9781466551503|ref=RefiningOil}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the field of transformer maintenance, vacuum pumps play an essential role in transformer oil purification plants which are used to extend the lifetime of transformers in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vacuum transformer oil purification plants|url=http://www.hering-vpt.de/eok-oil-purifying-plants/|publisher=Hering-VPT GmbH|accessdate=6 Jul 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vacuum may be used to power, or provide assistance to mechanical devices.  In hybrid and [[diesel engine]] [[motor vehicle]]s, a pump fitted on the engine (usually on the [[camshaft]]) is used to produce vacuum.  In [[petrol engine]]s, instead, vacuum is typically obtained as a side-effect of the operation of the engine and the flow restriction created by the [[throttle]] plate, but may be also supplemented by an electrically operated vacuum pump to boost braking assistance or improve fuel consumption.  This vacuum may then be used to power the following motor vehicle components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hellahd.com/index.php/default/electrics/universal-electric-vacuum-pumps/electrics-product-11/|publisher=Hella|title=UP28 Universal Electric Vacuum Pump|accessdate=14 Jun 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[vacuum servo]] booster for the [[hydraulic brakes]], motors that move [[zone damper|damper]]s in the ventilation system, [[throttle]] driver in the [[cruise control]] [[servomechanism]], door locks or trunk releases.

In an [[aircraft]], the vacuum source is often used to power [[gyroscope]]s in the various [[flight instrument]]s.  To prevent the complete loss of instrumentation in the event of an [[Electricity|electrical]] failure, the instrument panel is deliberately designed with certain instruments powered by electricity and other instruments powered by the vacuum source.

== Hazards ==
Old vacuum-pump oils that were produced before circa 1980 often contain a mixture of several different dangerous [[polychlorinated biphenyl|polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)]], which are highly [[toxic]], [[carcinogenic]], [[persistent organic pollutant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Martin G Broadhurst | title=Use and replaceability of polychlorinated biphenyls | journal=Environmental Health Perspectives | volume=2 |date=October 1972 | pages=81–102 | doi=10.2307/3428101 | pmid=4628855 | pmc=1474898 | jstor=3428101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=C J McDonald | author2=R E Tourangeau | last-author-amp=yes | title=PCBs: Question and Answer Guide Concerning Polychlorinated Biphenyls | publisher=Government of Canada: Environment Canada Department | date=1986 | isbn=978-0-662-14595-0 | url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/wmd-dgd/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=AD2C1530-1&amp;offset=3&amp;toc=show | accessdate=2007-11-07 | df= }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wyoming Catholic College''' is a private, [[Catholic]] [[liberal arts college]] in [[Lander, Wyoming|Lander]], [[Wyoming]].  It uses the town's sole Catholic church and accompanying facilities as an interim campus. WCC is the only private four-year institution of higher education in the state. It is endorsed by [[The Newman Guide to Choosing a Catholic College]].

The college takes no federal aid money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/us/to-keep-free-of-federal-reins-wyoming-catholic-college-rejects-student-aid.html | title = To keep free of federal reins, Wyoming Catholic College rejects student aid | date = April 11, 2015 | accessdate = April 11, 2015 | last = Healy | first = Jack | newspaper = [[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accreditation==
WCC is one of the newest colleges in the United States, admitting its first class in 2007 and graduating them in the spring of 2011. WCC was granted Institutional Preaccreditation status by the [[American Academy for Liberal Education]] (AALE) on September 1, 2010, and  achieved candidate status by the [[Higher Learning Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wyomingcatholiccollege.com/about-wcc/faq/index.aspx FAQs] at ''wyomingcatholiccollege''.com. Accessed 2011-10-13.  "The conferral of this status “signifies institutional integrity and a strong commitment to undergraduate education,” according to AALE’s Standards and Criteria for Program Accreditation. This status of accreditation allows Wyoming Catholic College to operate in an accredited manner until it receives full Institutional Accreditation in the next few months.&lt;/ref&gt; WCC received final accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission on November 15, 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wyomingcatholic.org/college-receives-formal-notice-accreditation-higher-learning-commission-hlc/|title=College Receives Formal Notice of Accreditation from The Higher Learning Commission (HLC) - Wyoming Catholic College|date=2018-11-07|work=Wyoming Catholic College|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
Because it offers a four-year, integrated, [[Great Books]] curriculum, Wyoming Catholic College has no majors, minors, specialized degrees or graduate programs; it awards graduating students the degree of [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Liberal Arts.  As of spring of 2018, there were over 160 students enrolled.

In the spring of 2016, Wyoming Catholic College became the second college in the nation to accept the [[Classic Learning Test]] (CLT) as an alternative to the SAT and ACT for college admissions.

The curriculum was designed to give students a general liberal arts education through a study of the [[Great Books]]. Courses include Humanities, Theology, Philosophy, Math/Science, Fine Arts, Latin, Trivium, and Leadership.&lt;ref name="wyocath"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wyomingcatholic.org/academics/ |title=Academics |work=Wyoming Catholic College Website |accessdate=2018-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the college's vision comes from the [[Integrated Humanities Program]] founded by John Senior at the [[University of Kansas]].

The school's Outdoor Leadership Program supplements the curriculum by taking students into the nearby [[Wind River Mountains]] (among other locations in the Wyoming/Utah area) to help them form their memories and imaginations through sense experience of the created world.  In addition, the program teaches leadership and decision-making skills all while aiming to help the students grow in the [[Cardinal virtues|Cardinal Virtues]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} All of the Freshmen go on a three week backpacking course in the Rocky mountains before beginning the school year.
[[File:COR hike.jpg|thumb|Freshmen hike through a meadow in the Teton Mountains during their three week backpacking course.]]

==Student life==
On Sunday evenings, students gather together for [[Swing (dance)|swing dancing]] and [[waltz]]ing.  At various times in the academic year, there are formal themed dances put on by each of the classes.  The Easter Dance is put on by everyone, starting after the Easter Vigil Mass with a feast that moves into hours of dancing and traditionally finishing with watching the sunrise.

About four times a year, the college invites a guest lecturer to take part in its Distinguished Lecture Series, which is attended by all students in formal attire.  The topics vary, but often focus on the Philosophical and Theological traditions of Western Civilization. 
[[File:Wyoming_Catholic_College_Dorms.jpg|thumb|Wyoming Catholic College Dorms, ]]
Often, some of the dormitories will hold events that often involve singing [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish folk]] songs, playing instruments, and baking together.

Throughout the year, the college offers intramurals such as soccer, basketball, volleyball, and frisbee.

Outside of classes, the students participate in a number of outdoor activities such as [[rock climbing]], [[caving]], running, biking, and [[Abseiling|rappelling]].  In 2016, the college opened up Crux Coffee, an outdoor themed coffee shop open to the public. There is also a vibrant extra-curricular choral program featuring a mixed choir and both men and women's [[schola|scholas]] currently under the direction of Dr. Christopher Hodkinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wyomingcatholic.org/person/christopher-hodkinson/|title=Christopher Hodkinson, M.A., M.Phil. - Wyoming Catholic College|work=Wyoming Catholic College|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choir regularly sings Sacred music from the 15th centuries all the way to recent compositions of composers like [[Arvo Pärt|Arvo Part]] and Christoph Dalitz.

===Spiritual Life===
The college offers Mass and confessions from Sunday through Friday at the shared Holy Rosary Parish in Lander.  Three times a week, the college offers the [[Tridentine Mass|Extraordinary Form of the Mass]].  On weekday afternoons, [[Eucharistic adoration|Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament]] is offered at De Smet chapel in its Baldwin classroom building. The chapel, used occasionally for Mass with a custom made [[Ad orientem|ad-orientem]] altar, is named after [[Pierre-Jean De Smet|Father Pierre-Jean De Smet]], the first priest to celebrate Mass in the Wyoming territory. 

In addition, the College regularly offers theological and spiritual practicums for its students.
