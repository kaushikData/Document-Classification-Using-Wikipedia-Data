The '''Association of Christian Schools International''' ('''ACSI''') is an association of [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Protestant]] [[Christian school]]s.

==Purposes==
ACSI is a Protestant association for [[Christian]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acsiglobal.org/home-2/faq |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=2012-09-24 |publisher=Association of Christian Schools International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925013617/http://www.acsiglobal.org/home-2/faq |archivedate=2012-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its stated mission is to strengthen Christian schools and equip Christian educators worldwide as they prepare students academically and inspire them to become devoted followers of Jesus Christ. It supports the belief that [[Scripture]] is the revealed Word of God&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acsi.org/about-acsi/statement-of-faith |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130223055330/http://www.acsi.org/about-acsi/statement-of-faith |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-23 |title=Statement of Faith |accessdate=2012-09-24 |publisher=Association of Christian Schools International }}&lt;/ref&gt; and should be taught as truth.

The association offers multiple services including [[school accreditation|accreditation]] for early-education programs and  [[primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acsi.org/accreditation |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130223090241/http://www.acsi.org/accreditation |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-23 |title=Accreditation |accessdate=2012-09-24 |publisher=Association of Christian Schools International }}&lt;/ref&gt; certification, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acsiglobal.org/certification |title=Certification |accessdate=2012-09-24 |publisher=Association of Christian Schools International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926205004/http://www.acsiglobal.org/certification |archivedate=2012-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; curriculum, legal/legislative services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acsi.org/services/legal-legislative |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130223125245/http://www.acsi.org/services/legal-legislative |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-23 |title=Legal Legislative Services |accessdate=2012-09-24 |publisher=Association of Christian Schools International }}&lt;/ref&gt; and urban school services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acsi.org/services/urban-schools |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130223074556/http://www.acsi.org/services/urban-schools |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-23 |title=Urban School Services |accessdate=2012-09-24 |publisher=Association of Christian Schools International }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because ACSI does not accredit [[college]]s or [[universities]], it is not [[List of recognized accreditation associations of higher learning|recognized as an accreditor of higher education institutions]] by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] or the [[United States Department of Education]]. However, the organization allows institutions of higher learning to be members. In 1994 ACSI's primary school and secondary school programs became officially recognized by the [[National Council for Private School Accreditation]] (NCPSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Laura |last=Miller |title=Private School Accrediting Group Names Members |url=http://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/1994/10/05/05accred.h14.html |work=[[Education Week]] |date=1994-10-05 |accessdate=2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Department of Education does not recognize or certify agencies for the accreditation of primary and secondary schools, including [[regional accreditation|regional accrediting]] agencies.

== History ==

ACSI was founded in 1978 through the merger of three associations: The National Christian School Education Association; The Ohio Association of Christian Schools; and the Western Association of Christian Schools. Soon after the new association formed, several other Christian school associations joined ACSI: The Southeast Association of Christian Schools; the Association of Teachers of Christian Schools (Midwest); the Great Plains Association of Christian Schools; and the Texas Association of Christian Schools.

ACSI was first headquartered in [[La Habra]], [[California]], and moved to its larger headquarters in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], in 1994. Today, in addition to the headquarters facility, ACSI has 28 regional offices worldwide and serves 23,400 member schools in more than 100 countries. ACSI is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization governed by a 36-member Executive Board elected by member schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acsi.org/about-acsi/history |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130224004600/http://www.acsi.org/about-acsi/history |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-24 |title=ACSI History |accessdate=2012-09-24 |publisher=Association of Christian Schools International }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuit==
{{main|Association of Christian Schools International et al. v. Roman Stearns et al.}}

In spring 2006 the Association of Christian Schools International sued the [[University of California]] system alleging that the rejection of several Christian science courses was "viewpoint discrimination" which violated the [[United States constitution|constitution]]al rights of applicants from Christian schools whose high school coursework is deemed inadequate preparation for college. The lawsuit was brought by the parents of six children who had not been rejected from the university. In August 2006, the case ''[[Association of Christian Schools International v. Roman Stearns]]'' was allowed to proceed against the university while [[lawsuit]]s against individual school officials were thrown out.&lt;ref name=NCSE20060910&gt;{{cite press release |title=Creationist lawsuit against UC system to proceed |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |date=2006-09-10 |url=http://ncse.com/news/2006/08/creationist-lawsuit-against-uc-system-to-proceed-00791 |accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Center for Science Education]] noted, "One of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs is [[Wendell Bird]], a former staff attorney for the [[Institute for Creation Research]]. As a special assistant attorney general for [[Louisiana]], he defended the state's "equal time" law, which was ruled to be unconstitutional in ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]''.&lt;ref name=NCSE20060910/&gt; The National Center for Science Education works in collaboration with [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[National Association of Biology Teachers]] and the [[National Science Teachers Association]], which consider [[creationism]] and [[intelligent design]] to be [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref&gt;See: 1) [[List of scientific societies rejecting intelligent design]] 2)  [[Wikisource:Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District/4:Whether_ID_Is_Science#Page 83 of 139|Kitzmiller v. Dover page 83]]. The Discovery Institute's [http://www.dissentfromdarwin.org/ Dissent From Darwin Petition] has been signed by about 500 scientists. The AAAS, the largest association of scientists in the U.S., has 120,000 members, and [http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2002/1106id2.shtml firmly rejects ID] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021113000000/http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2002/1106id2.shtml |date=November 13, 2002 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikisource|Association of Christian Schools International v. Roman Sterns}}
The Association retained leading [[intelligent design]] proponent [[Michael Behe]] to testify in the case as an expert witness. Behe's expert witness report claimed that the Christian textbooks were excellent works for high school students and he defended that view in a deposition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Behe|Behe, Michael J.]] (April 2, 2007) [http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007-04-02_Behe_expert_report.pdf Expert Witness report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627000000/http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007-04-02_Behe_expert_report.pdf |date=June 27, 2008 }} in [[Association of Christian Schools International et al. v. Roman Stearns et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] (May 30, 2007) [http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007-05-30_Behe_depo_transcript.pdf Deposition of Michael Behe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627000000/http://scienceblogs.com/authority/2007-05-30_Behe_depo_transcript.pdf |date=June 27, 2008 }} in [[Association of Christian Schools International et al. v. Roman Stearns et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2008 the defendants won a legal victory when their motion for partial summary judgment was granted, and the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Interim victory in California creationism case |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |date=2008-04-01 |url=http://ncse.com/news/interim-victory-in-california-creationism-case |accessdate=2008-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 8, 2008, Judge Otero entered summary judgment against plaintiff ACSI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2008/08/08/news/californian/murrieta/za3f1fe48ff6b8872882574a0000ff96d.txt |title=Judge throws out religious discrimination suit |publisher=[[North County Times]] |date=August 8, 2008 |first= |last= |accessdate=2008-08-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080815065757/http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2008/08/08/news/californian/murrieta/za3f1fe48ff6b8872882574a0000ff96d.txt |archivedate=15 August 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:beatrice ensor.jpg|thumb|Beatrice Ensor]]
'''Beatrice Ensor''' (1885–1974) was an English [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] educationist, pedagogue, co-founder of the [[New Education Fellowship]] (later World Education Fellowship)[http://www.wef-international.org/] and editor of the journal Education for the New Era[http://www.wef-international.org/publications.php].

==Early years==
Born in [[Marseille]] on 11 August 1885, Beatrice Nina Frederica de Normann was the eldest child of Albert Edward de Normann and Irene Matilda (née Wood). Her father was in the shipping business and her early years were spent in [[Marseille]] and [[Genoa]], hence her fluency in Italian and French. She was greatly influenced by a theosophical book that a visitor to her home had left. This led in 1908 to her joining the [[Theosophical Society]], which came to play an important part in her life. She had two brothers - Sir Eric de Normann (K. B. E., C. B) and Albert Wilfred Noel de Normann ("Bill").

Coming to England to complete her education, she trained as a domestic science teacher and for a short while taught the subject at a college in [[Sheffield]]. This led to her being appointed Inspector of women’s and girls’ education by [[Glamorgan County Council]]. She became disenchanted with the regimented and passive teaching she saw but when she inspected a Montessori school in [[Cheltenham]], she became very interested in the ideas of [[Maria Montessori]] whom she met and corresponded with. She attended a conference in [[East Runton]] in 1914 organised by the New Ideals in Education group; the topic of the conference was 'The Montessori Method in Education'. She was a vegetarian and anti vivisectionist.

== Theosophy and St Christopher School ==

In the early months of [[World War I]] she was appointed by the Board of Education as H. M. Inspector of domestic science in South West England based in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. But she found civil service work uncongenial and, having played a major part in founding the Theosophical Fraternity in Education, she was invited to become Organising Secretary of the Theosophical Education Trust in 1915. In this role one of her main tasks was the consolidation of the Society’s educational work at [[Letchworth Garden City]] into [[St Christopher School]][http://www.stchris.co.uk/], which was co-educational and boarding, with [[Isabel King]] as its Headmistress. One of the teachers at the school for a while was [[V. K. Krishna Menon]][https://web.archive.org/web/20070929084656/http://www.tkminstitute.org/]. She worked closely for a time with [[George Arundale]] who became the President of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]].

In 1917 she married Robert Weld Ensor, of Northern Irish/English descent, who had served in the Canadian North West Mounted Police [http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/] and was then a Captain in the Canadian Army coming to England, fighting in France and then going on the Murmansk Expedition. It was theosophy that brought them together. They had one son, Michael, born in 1919.  [[Annie Besant]], [[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa]] and [[Harold Baillie-Weaver]] were his godparents.

== New Era in Education ==

[[File:ConferenceBE.jpg|thumb|Beatrice Ensor with (left to right) [[Ovide Decroly]], [[Pierre Bovet]], [[Édouard Claparède]], [[Paul Geheeb]] and [[Adolphe Ferrière]]]]
In 1922 through the auspices of the Save the Children Foundation she helped to bring under nourished Hungarian children to Britain for a spell to recover their health. She travelled to [[Budapest]] and returned with the first party. For this she was awarded a medal by the Hungarian Red Cross [http://www.ifrc.org/address/hu.asp]. But a more enduring role to her Theosophical role was the production, with [[A. S. Neill]] for a time as joint editor, of the Journal ''[[Education for the New Era]]''[http://www.neweraineducation.co.uk/], which still flourishes some 90 years later. Co-operating magazines in French and German followed edited by [[Adolphe Ferrière]] [[:fr:Adolphe Ferrière]] and [[Elisabeth Rotten]] [[:de:Elisabeth Rotten]] respectively.

== The New (World) Education Fellowship ==
[[File:Beatrice Ensor Jung Montreux 1923.jpg|thumb|Beatrice Ensor and Professor [[Carl Jung]] - [[Montreux]] 1923 - Second International Conference of the N.E.F.]]In 1921, together with [[Iwan Hawliczek]], she organised a conference in [[Calais]] on the ‘Creative Self-Expression of the Child’, with attendance of over 100. Although this was inspired by theosophists anxious to prevent another world war, what emerged was the New (later World) Education Fellowship [http://www.wef-international.org/], an entirely non-political and non-sectarian forum for new ideas in education. It was not to advocate any particular method but to ‘seek to find the thread of truth in all methods’. It still has active sections in some 20 countries. Beatrice Ensor, together with the editors of the other two journals, formed the initial organising committee of the N.E.F., which held international conferences at two yearly intervals, presided over by distinguished educationists and pedagogues. 

The second conference of 1923 was held in [[Montreux]], [[Switzerland]] and there she met Professor [[Carl Jung]] whom she invited to speak at a meeting in London (where she introduced him to [[H G Wells]]), [[Emile Jacques-Dalcroze]], Professor [[Franz Cizek]] and [[Alfred Adler]].

In 1929 the conference was held in [[Kronborg Castle]], [[Helsingör]], Denmark and amongst the delegates and speakers were [[Maria Montessori]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Kurt Lewin]], [[Adolphe Ferrière]] [[:fr:Adolphe Ferrière]], [[Ovide Decroly]], [[Helen Parkhurst]], [[Pierre Bovet]] [[:fr:Pierre Bovet]], [[A S Neill]], [[Elisabeth Rotten]], [[Franz Cizek]], Dr [[Harold Rugg]], [[Professor T P Nunn]], and [[Paul Geheeb]] [[:de:Paul Geheeb]].

Other conferences were held at [[Locarno]] (1927), [[Cheltenham]] and [[Heidelberg]] (1925),

She was a member of the Education Advisory Committee of the Labour Party for a short while but her utopian views clashed with those of [[R. H. Tawney]] and resigned her position.

== The N.E.F. and Unesco ==
 
Just as theosophy had a profound influence on the N.E.F. so the N.E.F. had a profound influence on the creation of [[UNESCO]][https://web.archive.org/web/20070529005144/http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID%3D29008%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html]. It was described as "the midwife at the birth of UNESCO" (Kobayashi) and has been an [[NGO]][https://web.archive.org/web/20070624015231/http://erc.unesco.org/ong/en/directory/ONG_Desc_portal.asp?mode=gn&amp;code=635] of UNESCO since 1966 (Hiroshi Iwama). It changed its name to W.E.F. that year.

== Frensham Heights School ==

Meanwhile, problems were building up within the [[Theosophical Education Trust]] leading to tensions in the Letchworth community in which the termination of her husband’s appointment as Secretary of the Trust played a part. In 1925 Isabel King and Beatrice Ensor left to establish [[Frensham Heights]][http://www.frensham-heights.org.uk/], a co-educational school in [[Surrey]], from [[Montessori]] to university entrance level, for which Mrs. Edith Douglas-Hamilton (one of the Wills tobacco heiresses) provided the capital. Some of the St Christopher staff and children moved to Frensham to form its nucleus. However, two years later, Mrs. Douglas-Hamilton died unexpectedly without having established the financial independence of the school that she had intended. The dramatic change produced a situation where Beatrice Ensor and Isabel King did not feel they could work. They both left but the break was without bitterness and they both remained on the board of governors for several years.

== Lecture Tours and South Africa ==

Beatrice Ensor then concentrated her work on the New Era and N.E.F. and undertook two lecture trips to [[North America]] in 1926 and 1928, speaking on new movements in education in [[Boston]], [[New York City]], [[Detroit]], and [[Chicago]]. She was also one of an educational group that was invited to tour [[Poland]] and visited [[South Africa]] in 1927 and 1929.

Her husband had moved to [[Louterwater]] in [[South Africa]] where he acquired a large farm in a little developed valley, recently found to be suitable for the growing of deciduous fruit. The orchards he planted were just beginning to bear by 1933 when he died. This meant that Beatrice had to move to South Africa and take over the farm. This greatly restricted her educational work. She was one of a group invited to lecture in [[Australia]] in 1937, where she was awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] by the [[University of Western Australia]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. She helped the South African section of the N.E.F. and financed and had built on her farm a school for mixed race children, for whom no provision existed in the area.

When it became clear that her son would be pursuing a civil service career, just as her brothers had done, and did not want to take on the farm she sold it and moved to a house on the coast at [[Keurboomstrand, Western Cape|Keurboomstrand]] near [[Plettenberg Bay]]. But when her family were settled in England she moved there to be with her grandchildren, living first at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], then in [[London]], at [[Dolphin Square]], where she died in 1974.

'''''Capitán Miranda'' (ROU 20)''' is a three-masted [[staysail]] [[schooner]] of the [[National Navy of Uruguay|Uruguayan Navy]].

==Ship history==
The ''Capitán Miranda'' was ordered in January 1930 from the Spanish ''Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval'' shipyard at [[Cádiz]], laid down on 3 March and launched on 27 July 1930. As a [[hydrographic survey|hydrographic vessel]] she displaced 552 tons, with an overall length of {{Convert|54.85|m|abbr=on}}, and a beam of {{Convert|8|m|abbr=on}}. Capable of {{Convert|12.5|kn|lk=on}}, the ship was armed with a 37&amp;nbsp;mm cannon and a machine gun, and had a complement of 52. She was named after Captain [[Francisco Prudencio Miranda]] (1868-1925), Uruguayan naval officer and marine geographer.&lt;ref name="AEMC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinacivil.com/noticias/noticia.asp?idn=8683 |title=Buque Escuela ''Capitán Miranda'' |work=Asociación Española de Marina Civil |date=15 June 2005 |accessdate=1 July 2012 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{sp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Sea trial]]s were completed on 19 November 1930, and on the 21st ''Capitán Miranda'' was delivered to the Uruguayan Navy. She served as a survey ship, charting the coasts and waters of Uruguay until 1976. She was then due to be scrapped, but instead was converted into a three-masted schooner. The conversion was completed by 20 October 1978, when she began in her new role as a training ship. The ''Capitan Miranda'' has since participated in numerous international [[tall ship]] regattas.&lt;ref name="AEMC"/&gt;

Winters began working as a [[news presenter|news anchor and reporter]] in January 1999 for a [[news magazine]] show, then called Insights, that aired on the local [[National Broadcast Company|NBC]] affiliate each Saturday at noon.

Upon graduation Winters worked as a news anchor and reporter for BBB Communications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbbtv12.com/index.html |title=BBB Communications |publisher=BBB Communications |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422133908/http://bbbtv12.com/index.html |archivedate=2011-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a small [[Cablevision]] [[television station|station]] providing [[local news]] coverage for the suburbs north and west of Knoxville, Tennessee.

In 2001 he accepted a freelance position in New York City and relocated to Manhattan.

After witnessing the [[September 11 attacks|September 11th terrorist attacks]], he provided news coverage for WVLT and several [[newspaper]]s in East Tennessee.

Winters later picked up the nickname "gay socialite" for his community and social involvement mainly by volunteering for various [[charitable organization|charities]] such as LGBT advocacy groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nextmagazine.com/nexus/scene-heard-bachelor-auction-heats-vlada-trevor-project-benefit |title=Bachelor Auction Heats Vlada |publisher=Next Magazine |date=2009-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110823062643/http://nextmagazine.com/nexus/scene-heard-bachelor-auction-heats-vlada-trevor-project-benefit |archivedate=2011-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; animal rescues &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nj.com/hobokennow/index.ssf/2008/10/miss_hobokens_pet_parade_here.html |title=Miss Hobokens Pet Parade? |publisher= NJ.com |date=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Political organisation|political organizations]] such as [[Hillary Clinton]]s [[United States Senate]] and [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|Presidential campaigns]], [[New York City Council]] [[Christine Quinn|Speaker Christine Quinn's]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.quinn09.com/main.cfm?actionId=globalShowStaticContent&amp;screenKey=cmpNews&amp;htmlID=13315&amp;nav=news&amp;s=quinn |title=GaySocialites.com endorses Quinn |publisher=Quinn09.com }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; bid for Mayor and [[Sean Patrick Maloney|Sean Patrick Maloney's]] attempt at New York [[attorney general]] in addition to working in Manhattan's [[nightlife]] scene hosting late night variety-style shows (in such historic venues as [[Tunnel (New York nightclub)|the Tunnel]], [[the Limelight]]/ Avalon and [[Stonewall Inn]].)

During this same time, Winters also worked as an online entertainment correspondent for queerplanet, an Australian-based media group for which he acquired the operations rights in 2011 and re-branded as queerplanet.net: powered by GaySocialites.com.

In 2006 Winters turned his nickname into a business when he co-founded GaySocialites.com, an online magazine dedicated to providing topics that appeal to [[gay men]] beyond [[LGBT]] news coverage, with [[Anthony Lago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://gaysocialites.com/contents/the-history-of-the-gaysocialites/ |title=The History of the GaySocialites |publisher=GaySocialites.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315145515/http://gaysocialites.com/contents/the-history-of-the-gaysocialites/ |archivedate=2011-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GaySocialites.com and The GaySocialites Media Group==
From October 2005 until October 2011, Charles Winters maintained credits as the founding editor and held the top executive post with titles ranging from [[Managing Editor]] to [[Chief Executive Officer]] at GaySocialites.com.

After launching GaySocialites.com in October 2006 as a source to provide information, gossip and listings about New York nightclubs, Winters led the website to first earn credibility among colleagues and competitors with coverage of the death of [[Anna Nicole Smith]] in early 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cliqz.com/entertainment/c/55043.html |title=Anna Nicole Smith's estated denied any inheritance from late-husband's billions |publisher= Cliqz.com |date=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, Winters established himself as the [[sole proprietor]] of the [[website]] and all entities of the GaySocialites [[brand]].

GaySocialites.com acquired queerplanet.net in June 2011 to form a larger organization called the GaySocialites Media, which also went by the name, Charles Winters Information Management&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nextmagazine.com/nexus/gossip-roundup-katy-perry-rockbar-cops-eagle-and-more |title=GOSSIP ROUNDUP: Katy Perry at Rockbar, Cops at The Eagle AND MORE! |publisher=Next Magazine |date=2011-06-30 |access-date=2011-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002141857/http://www.nextmagazine.com/nexus/gossip-roundup-katy-perry-rockbar-cops-eagle-and-more# |archive-date=2011-10-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; during the first quarter of 2012.  Soon after the acquisition, queerplanet.net's format was changed to cover "abnormal news and odd information."  In 2012, queerplanet.net re-entered the gay market as a news aggregator gathering news from a variety of LGBT outlets granting easy access to those searching the web for topics relating to the gay community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://queerplanet.net/about-us |title=About Us |publisher=gaysocialites.com |date=2011-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126100204/http://queerplanet.net/about-us/ |archivedate=2012-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a month, Charles Winters Information Management began development on two new web products. CouponAngel.us targeted those interested in the coupon craze. His sister, Donna Winters, was appointed Vice-President and Editor-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://charleswinters.info/?page_id=21 |title=About Us |publisher=charleswinters.info |date=2011-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330170313/http://charleswinters.info/?page_id=21 |archivedate=2012-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the GaySocialites.com celebrated its sixth anniversary, Winters announced he would be moving into a new role as CEO and Editorial Director for all websites operated by one umbrella organization, GaySocialites Media Group.  At the same time, he appointed [[Thomas Bistritz]] as the new Editor-in-Chief and the first person to hold the top position at the website other than Winters himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nextmagazine.com/nexus/gossip-roundup-g-lounge-teases-changes-demanda-dahling-takes-over-gay-socialites |title=Demanda Dahling Takes Over Gay Socialites |publisher=NextMagazine.com |date=2011-10-26 |access-date=2011-10-28 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713073724/http://nextmagazine.com/nexus/gossip-roundup-g-lounge-teases-changes-demanda-dahling-takes-over-gay-socialites# |archive-date=2012-07-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Winters launched GaySocialites.com's first video entity called "The Popularity Contest". It is a weekly count down show that recaps the most popular topics on GaySocialites.com each week. The pilot episode was titled, "Weekends with Winters" and he served as the program's initial host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/gaysocialites |title=GaySocialites YouTube Channel |publisher= YouTube.com |date=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2013, he announced the debut of the GaySocialites.com Times Square Studios where he and others will produce a new series of online digital media programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gaysocialites.com/2013/08/07/introducing-the-all-new-gaysocialites-com-times-square-studios-video-63196/ |title=Introducing the all new GaySocialites.com Times Square Studios [video] |publisher= GaySocialites.com |date=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late November, GaySocialites.com announced that it would be producing a new online talk show called "The Buzz" set to debut in mid-December with a panel of co-host including Winters and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gaysocialites.com/2013/11/14/gaysocialites-com-introduces-the-buzz-a-new-online-talk-show-55311/ |title=GaySocialites.com introduces ‘The Buzz’, a new online talk show |publisher= GaySocialites.com |date=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Buzz by GaySocialites.com aired just a few episodes before taking an indefinite production hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gaysocialites.com/category/the-buzz/ |title=The Buzz - GaySocialites.com |publisher= GaySocialites.com |date=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Classical Public Radio Network''' was a national, 24-hour classical music service in the United States. Its mission was to preserve, enhance and expand experience of classical music for radio listeners.  With this vision, CPRN was established in 1998 as a limited-liability non-profit company – a joint venture of [[KUSC]] (Los Angeles) and [[Colorado Public Radio]] – with startup funding from the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]]. In 2003, CPRN and [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) joined in a collaborative marketing arrangement to further expand the network, but ceased national broadcast operations on June 30, 2008.

CPRN offered listeners the full spectrum of the classical repertoire from medieval times to the present – complete symphonies and orchestral pieces, chamber works, opera selections, art songs, and choral works. The announcers and music staff programmed the music with a focus on core repertoire and superior recordings. Each announcer brought personal expertise to selecting featured music, alternate performances, artist tributes and unique recordings, as well as seasonal and date-specific programming.

Enhancing the 24-hour program stream were several weekly and daily shows and features. Weekdays, Kimberlea Daggy hosted ''The Daily Special'' at noon, and Charles Andrews unearthed ''Buried Treasures'' at 8:00pm. On Sunday mornings, Stephanie Wendt presented ''Sacred Classics'', featuring three hours of meditative music for the heart and mind. Contemporary classical music was explored every Saturday evening by Alan Chapman on ''Modern Masterpieces''. The programming was regularly enhanced with holiday programming, new releases, composer profiles, and frequent appearances by artists in the classical music world.

CPRN programming was carried across the country on the following public radio stations: [[KUSC]], Los Angeles; [[KVOD]], Denver; [[WBHM]], Birmingham, AL; [[KBSU-FM]], Boise, ID; [[South Dakota Public Broadcasting]], Vermillion, SD; High Plains Public Radio, Garden City, KS ([[KANZ]]) and Amarillo, TX ([[KJJP]]); [[KBYI]], Rexburg, ID; [[KWTU]], Tulsa, OK; [[WTEB]], New Bern, NC; [[WFCR]], Amherst, MA; [[WOSU-FM]], Columbus, OH; and on digital radio, [[WHYY-FM]], Philadelphia, PA,  [[WJCT-FM]], Jacksonville, FL, and  [[KDFC-FM]], San Francisco.

Former client stations operated a total of 53 signals and reached more than one million listeners weekly. Programming was distributed to stations via the [[Public Radio Satellite System]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4152">'''Critical friend''' has its origins in [[critical pedagogy]] education reforms in the 1970s and arose out of the self-appraisal activity which is attributed to Desmond Nuttall.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Harold (1988) "The Advisory Service and Consultancy". In Gray, H. (Ed) ''Management Consultancy in Schools'' (1988), London: Cassell&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most widely used definitions is from 1993,
{{quote|''A critical friend can be defined as a trusted person who asks provocative questions, provides data to be examined through another lens, and offers critiques of a person’s work as a friend. A critical friend takes the time to fully understand the context of the work presented and the outcomes that the person or group is working toward. The friend is an advocate for the success of that work.''&lt;ref&gt;Costa, A. and Kallick, B.(1993) "Through the Lens of a Critical Friend". ''Educational Leadership'' 51(2) 49-51&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Andrew Hutchinson, a public sector consultant, introduced the term to the Local Government Consortium at the [[University of Warwick]] in 1998 and it is cited in several papers produced by Professor Jean Hartley of the Local Government Consortium. The critical friend is characterised as falling between the extremes of the "hostile witness" and the "uncritical lover"&lt;ref&gt;Brighouse, T. and Woods, D. (1999) ''How to Improve your School''. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; whereas earlier texts go so far as to allude to Janus in discussing the concept.&lt;ref&gt;Bolam, R., Smith, G. and Canter, H. (1978) ''Local Education Authority Advisers and the Mechanisms of Innovations''. Windsor: NFER&lt;/ref&gt;

This dichotomy appealed to Hutchinson who frequently used the term while leader of the South East Midlands Citizen's Charter Quality Network run by the [[Cabinet Office]] in Whitehall. In his time running the network he came into regular contact with fellow Lancastrian and Government Minister [[Peter Kilfoyle]] MP, Public Service Minister who was responsible for the running of the networks as minister. When Kilfoyle found himself increasingly distanced from the policy agenda of Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] and he chose to resign from Government, [[Hansard]] quotes him as saying that he wished to return to the back benches but remain a "critical friend" of the Government. 

He was misquoted in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' as they claimed that he had said that he wished to be a "candid friend" to Government. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the term critical friend has its origins in the softer sounding notion of the candid friend. Nonetheless following the resignation of Peter Kilfoyle ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper (a popular publication amongst the intelligentsia and public sector middle management) began to popularise the term which is increasingly entering into general usage. The phrase is still most commonly used in education circles but its wider use in the public sector can to a large part be attributed to Andrew Hutchinson and his natural enthusiasm for the concept, being described as 'a natural critical friend acting with positive intent' in 1999 by the then Chief Executive of [[Coventry City Council]], Iain Roxburgh, who is now Director of the Warwick Research Consortium. While a variety of useful and interesting quotations are to be found on the web&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criticalfriend.eu|title=criticalfriend.eu|website=www.criticalfriend.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps the reason for the popularity of the phrase is best summed up by the following quotation,
{{quote|''The Critical Friend is a powerful idea, perhaps because it contains an inherent tension. Friends bring a high degree of unconditional positive regard. Critics are, at first sight at least, conditional, negative and intolerant of failure. Perhaps the critical friend comes closest to what might be regarded as 'true friendship' – a successful marrying of unconditional support and unconditional critique.''&lt;ref&gt;A John MacBeath; Professor of Education Leadership, Cambridge University&lt;/ref&gt;''}}

'''Cross-registration''' in United States [[higher education]] is a system allowing students at one [[university]], [[liberal arts college|college]], or [[Faculty (division)|faculty within a university]] to take individual [[course (education)|course]]s for [[credit (education)|credit]] at another institution or faculty, typically in the same region.

Cross-registration gives students access to a wider variety of subject matter at a certain logistical cost: travel time, inconsistent academic calendars, etc.  It is governed by the home institution's regulations, which typically require that a similar course not be offered by the home institution, that the student not take too many outside courses, that certain basic types of courses be taken at the home institution, etc.

Among institutions, cross-registration is governed by agreements &amp;ndash; bilateral or regional (often consortia).  Money may or may not flow between the institutions to compensate for the difference between inbound and outbound cross-registrants.  Cross-registration allows universities in a region to focus on their area of specialization at the cost of not having direct control of their students' academic experience.

These last for three months, in general.&lt;ref name="concurso"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zara|first1=André|author2=Sarmento, Luciana|title=Escolha o seu curso preparatório para concursos públicos|url=http://www.abril.com.br/noticias/brasil/escolha-seu-curso-preparatorio-concursos-publicos-415705.shtml|website=[[Editora Abril|Abril.com]]|publisher=[[Grupo Abril]]|accessdate=15 November 2015|language=Portuguese|date=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cursinhos pré-vestibular always have extensive and semi-extensive courses, extensive courses taking place during most of the year, and semi-extensive ones taking place during the second semester, while the exact month to start may vary.

Most of them revise the subjects that the students need to know to take the vast majority of the vestibulares: [[Mathematics]], [[Portuguese language]] (literature and grammar), [[History]], [[Geography]], [[Biology]], [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]] and [[English studies|English language]]. Some still offer extra classes for deeper studies on specific subjects, current news (which may be required in some of the vestibulares) and techniques on writing an essay, which is required in all vestibulares.

It is also common to separate the students by the area of knowledge they wish to study in the university ([[humanities]], [[exact science]]s and [[biology|biological sciences]]), providing a deeper study in different subjects accordingly with the area (History and Geography; Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry; Biology and Chemistry respectively, with similar focus on Portuguese and English for all groups).

==World Scholar's Cup==
{{main|World Scholar's Cup}}
[[File:Daniel Berdichevsky at WSC 2009.JPG|thumb|left|Daniel Berdichevsky speaking at the 2009 World Scholar's Cup finals]]
In 2006, Berdichevsky, citing disappointment that Academic Decathlon ended at just a national level (United States Academic Decathlon has offered International Programs since 2013) in a rapidly more interconnected world, created the World Scholar's Cup. Though the World Scholar's Cup is based on the Academic Decathlon, it follows a different format. Instead of ten subjects like the Academic Decathlon, the World Scholar's Cup includes only six subjects: science, history, literature, art and music, social studies, and a special area, of which three of those events are based on a different yearly theme.&lt;ref name="DemiDec Presents the World Scholar's Cup" /&gt; At the competition, students participate in four events that encompass all six subjects: a curriculum-based debate, an essay, a multiple choice test and the "Scholar's Bowl", a live tournament where team members may answer questions together.&lt;ref name="DemiDec Presents the World Scholar's Cup" /&gt; Teams generally consist of either two or three students and may represent either their school, multiple schools, or even countries;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Scholar's Cup |url=http://www.scholarscup.org/competition |work=DemiDec Resources |publisher=World Scholar's Cup |accessdate=June 7, 2009 |quote=Students compete in teams of two or three. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729045658/http://www.scholarscup.org/competition |archivedate=July 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this policy further sets World Scholar's Cup apart from Academic Decathlon where six to nine students represent a single school.&lt;ref name="eligibility"&gt;{{cite book|title=USAD Study Guide 2003–2004|publisher=United States Academic Decathlon|year=2003|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The culmination of the annual competition is held in one of the competing countries,&lt;ref name="AZ Republic"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/mesa/articles/2009/04/20/20090420mr-scholars0422.html|title=Mountain View students headed to academic world final|last=Parker|first=Ray|date=April 20, 2009|publisher=The Arizona Republic|accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Q.C.

{{Politics of the Isle of Man}}
The '''Department of Education, Sport and Culture''' (''Rheynn Ynsee Spoyrt as Cultoor'') is a department of the [[Isle of Man Government]].

The department was formerly the '''Department of Education and Children''' and was renamed as the Department of Education, Sport and Culture under Statutory Document No. 2017/0325 with effect from November 2017.

The current Minister (since 2016) is [[Graham Cregeen]].

==History==
The Department of Education was renamed during the Government shake up of April 2010 as Department of Education and Children.

The ''Board of Education for the Isle of Man'' was established as a Board of Tynwald in 1872, and renamed the ''Council of Education'' in 1899.  It was reconstituted and renamed the ''Isle of Man Board of Education'' in 1946. Its function was to oversee and provide funds to the elected local school boards, and after 1920 to the popularly elected ''Isle of Man Central Education Authority'' which replaced them.  The Authority was renamed the ''Isle of Man Education Authority'' in 1923. The Isle of Man Education Act 1949, which was based on the UK [[Education Act 1944|'Butler Act']] of 1944, preserved this two-tier structure, the Board assuming the role of the Ministry of Education and the Authority that of a local education authority.

As the [[Isle of Man Government]] gained greater autonomy after 1950, a separate Education Authority of 24 elected members, parallel to and rivalling the [[House of Keys]], became increasingly anomalous and unwieldy, but it proved very tenacious of life.  An attempt to rationalise the system in 1968 resulted only in the merger of the Authority with the Board, which thereafter consisted of 5 "Tynwald members" appointed by Tynwald and 24 elected "non-Tynwald members", the former having control over finance and certain powers of veto.

The Department of Education was set up in 1987 as part of the new ministerial system, but a further attempt to remove the elected element was only partly successful. The Board was reconstituted as a body of 15 elected members with greatly reduced functions; in effect it became a panel from which members of the governing bodies of primary and secondary schools and the [[Isle of Man College]] were drawn. It was finally dissolved in June 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23162">The '''Dietary Guidelines for Americans''' ('''DGA''') provide nutritional advice for Americans who are more than 2 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnpp.usda.gov/dietary-guidelines|title=Dietary Guidelines - Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion|website=Cnpp.usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guidelines are published every 5 years by the [[US Department of Agriculture]], together with the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]]. The most recent edition is the [https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/resources/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans]. The nominal purpose of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans is to help [[health professionals]] and policymakers to advise Americans about healthy choices for their [[diet (nutrition)|diet]]. Although the Dietary Guidelines for Americans are purported to be based on a systematic review of the current body of nutrition science, the Advisory Committee tasked with formulating the plan for retrieval and analysis of the scientific evidence for the current edition of the DGA used a less than rigorous process for assessing the health effects of consumption of saturated fat and salt and for assessing the health effects of a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet. This less than rigorous review of the nutrition science literature resulted in omission of multiple large, high-quality, clinical trials and also omission of some high-quality prospective observational studies. Some Advisory Committee members also had conflicts-of-interest&lt;ref&gt;Garduno-Diaz, Sara Diana, Brooke Aksnes, and Maria Alvim Leite. "The normalization of conflicts of interest in the USA and their potential impact on public health nutrition." World Nutrition 8, no. 1 (2017): 123-127.&lt;/ref&gt; that in some cases were not fully disclosed. For these reasons, the quality of the Advisory Committee's Scientific Report and the validity of the 2015 - 2020 DGA itself has been challenged by critics as being unduly influenced by commercial interests and as being flawed due to [[confirmation bias]] of some members of the Advisory Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Teicholz, Nina. "The scientific report guiding the US dietary guidelines: is it scientific?." BMJ 351 (2015): h4962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nissen, Steven E 2016"&gt;Nissen, Steven E.

==History==
{{Main|History of USDA nutrition guides}}
The efforts of the [[US Federal Government]] to establish a scientific basis for [[human nutrition]] began with [[Wilbur Olin Atwater]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/oc/timeline/nutrition/|title=nutrition : USDA ARS|website=Ars.usda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; who published the first dietary recommendations for Americans in 1894, notably stating that, "We live not upon what we eat, but upon what we digest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/hist/oes_1894_farm_bul_23.pdf |title=Farmer's Bulletin |last=Arwater |first=W |date=1894 |website=Ars.usda.gov |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans has been published every 5 years beginning in 1980, producing eight guidelines to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/history.htm|title=Dietary Guidelines for Americans - History|website=Health.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; One consistent recommendation of these eight guidelines has been that Americans reduce their dietary consumption of fat and animal products, including meat, dairy, and eggs and to increase their dietary consumption of carbohydrates and plant foods, including fruits, vegetables, and grains.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion. Dietary guidelines for Americans, 1980 TO 2000. www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/1980_2000_chart.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The Guidelines were established so as to provide dietary advice that would improve the health of Americans and reduce their risk for [[chronic conditions]], such as [[cancer]], [[atherosclerosis]], [[hypertension]], [[heart disease]], [[stroke]], and [[renal disease]]. The Dietary Guidelines have the purpose of guiding the development of Federal policies and programs related to food, nutrition, and health.  The guidelines influence and guide policymakers for Federally-financed food and dietary education programs. They also influence clinicians in the United States and in other countries.

The intended audience for the Dietary Guidelines for Americans are policymakers, [[food science|nutrition scientists]], and [[dieticians]] and other [[health professionals]]. The Guidelines themselves are not intended to directly inform the general public, but instead to serve as an authoritative, evidence-based information source that policymakers and health professionals can use to advise Americans about making healthy choices in their daily lives so as to enjoy a healthy diet that also prevents chronic disease. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans provide an evidence-base that is used by the Federal government to develop nutrition education materials for Americans.

Federal law and regulation require that Federal government publications provide dietary guidance consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.  For the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) the guidelines provide the scientific rationale for the [[National School Lunch Program]] and [[School Breakfast Program]], feeding 30 million children every school day, and the [[Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children]], which has 8 million beneficiaries. For the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] [[Administration on Aging]], the guidelines provide the rationale for the [[Older Americans Act]] Nutrition Services programs which include more than 5,000 community-based nutrition service providers (e.g., [[Meals on Wheels]]), serving more than 900,000 meals a day across the United States. The [[Department of Defense]] uses the guidelines as the rationale for meal rations for military personnel and the [[Department of Veterans Affairs]] uses the guidelines to inform nutrition education for veterans who are patients of the VA Hospital System. In addition to these governmental audiences, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans are widely used by state and local governments, schools, commercial enterprises, community groups, the media, and the food industry to inform policy and program development intended to serve the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/introduction/dietary-guidelines-for-americans/|title=The Dietary Guidelines for Americans: What It Is, What It Is Not - 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelineswebsite=Health.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current guidelines==
The current Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2015-2020) were developed in three stages, beginning with a review of scientific evidence, followed by development of the guidelines, and finally with implementation of the guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/|title=2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines|website=Health.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to previous guidelines, the 2015–2020 guidelines put emphasize replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats, particularly polyunsaturated fats, with the goal of preventing heart attack and stroke.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Dong D., and Frank B. Hu. "Dietary fat and risk of cardiovascular disease: recent controversies and advances." Annual review of nutrition 37 (2017): 423-446.&lt;/ref&gt;

The guidelines provide a general recommendation that people follow a healthy eating pattern with appropriate calories, and that the evaluation of ones eating pattern accounts for all foods and beverages, including snacks. The recommended healthy eating pattern includes:

Include these in diet:
* A broad selection of vegetables, including dark green, red and orange, legumes (beans and peas), starches (potatoes, rice, pasta, bread), and others
* An emphasis on whole fruits
* An emphasis on whole grains
* Dairy products that are either fat-free or low fat, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and fortified soy beverages
* Protein foods to include seafood, lean meats,  poultry, eggs, legumes (beans and peas), and nuts, seeds, and soy products&lt;ref name="Food guide 2015"&gt;{{cite web |title=Executive Summary - 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines |website=Health.gov |url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/executive-summary/ |accessdate=1 July 2018 |language=en |date=2015}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limit these in diet:
* Trans fats
* Saturated fats to less than 10% of calories
* Added sugars to less than 10% of calories
* Sodium to less than 2.3&amp;nbsp;mg/day (5.8 g of salt/day), including both added table salt and salt in foods
* If consumed, use alcohol in moderation and only for adults — up to 1 drink daily for women and 2 drinks daily for men.&lt;ref name="Food guide 2015"/&gt;

The Dietary Guidelines also include a key recommendation to meet the [[Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans]].&lt;ref name="Food guide 2015"/&gt;

The [[MyPlate]] initiative, based on the recommendations of the 2015 -2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and produced by the [[USDA]] [[Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion]], is a nutrition education program directed at the general public, providing a guide to "finding healthy eating solutions to fit your lifestyle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.choosemyplate.gov/myplate-mywins|title=MyPlate, MyWins|date=12 December 2016|website=Choosemyplate.gov|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future guidelines==
The USDA has invited interested parties, including members of the general public, to participate and follow the development of the 2020 - 2025 edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Welcome to the portal for you to participate and follow the development of the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;/ref&gt; As mandated by the [[Agriculture Act of 2014]], this next edition of the guidelines will cover the full life-span of Americans, as expansion of the guidelines are planned to include recommendations for pregnant women, infants, and children younger than 2 years old. The Trump Administration has proposed a budget of more than $12 million for the evaluation of scientific evidence, development of the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and dissemination of the new edition to its target audience of policymakers, nutrition experts, and clinicians; this budget request has been supported by multiple organizations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eatrightpro.org/news-center/on-the-pulse-of-public-policy/from-the-hill/academy-supports-funding-2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-for-americans&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of the 2015 - 2020 Guidelines==
Each edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans has had attendant controversy, with objections particularly from scientists whose point-of-view was not reflected in the guidelines and from commercial interests negatively affected by the recommendations therein.&lt;ref&gt;Nestle M. Perspective: Challenges and Controversial Issues in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 1980–2015. Advances in Nutrition. 2018 Mar 1;9(2):148-50.&lt;/ref&gt; The response to the 2015-2020 guidelines was particularly contentious,&lt;ref&gt;Hite, Adele H., and Pamela Schoenfeld. "Open letter to the secretaries of the US Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services on the creation of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans." Nutrition 31, no. 5 (2015): 776-779.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in action by Congress mandating the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to evaluate the process used to update the DGA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/18/congress-we-need-to-review-the-dietary-guidelines-for-americans/|title=Congress: We need to review the Dietary Guidelines for Americans|first=Peter|last=Whoriskey|date=18 December 2015|accessdate=1 July 2018|website=Washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This review by the National Academies resulted in two reports. The first report, entitled "Optimizing the Process for Establishing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans: The Selection Process", identified opportunities for improving the process for selecting members of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalacademies.org/hmd/reports/2017/optimizing-the-process-for-establishing-the-dietary-guidelines-for-americans-the-selection-process.aspx|title=Optimizing the Process for Establishing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans: The Selection Process : Health and Medicine Division|website=nationalacademies.org|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, 2018 the [[USDA]] issued an official response to the first report of the National Academies committee.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/dietary_guidelines_for_americans/HMDRecommendations.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The second report from National Academies of Sciences, entitled "Redesigning the Process for Establishing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans", offers an exhaustive review and provides recommendations for improving the process of revising the Dietary Guidelines so as to best identify, analyze, and present the scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/24883/chapter/1#ix|title=Redesigning the Process for Establishing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans|date=16 November 2017|website=Nap.edu|accessdate=1 July 2018|doi=10.17226/24883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodology===

One critic contends that the current guidelines do not promote the public interest and have been corrupted by [[regulatory capture]], advancing the commercial concerns of [[agribusiness]] and large food processors, and the political concerns of scientists intent on preserving their point-of-view.&lt;ref&gt;Paarlberg, Robert. "Governing the dietary transition: Linking agriculture, nutrition, and health." Edited by Shenggen Fan and Rajul Pandya-Lorch (2012): 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic notes that the DGAs make recommendations that overvalue the findings of observational studies and surrogate measures of outcomes and that undervalue the findings of high-quality randomized controlled trials.&lt;ref name="Nissen, Steven E 2016"/&gt;

There is compelling evidence that [[food frequency questionnaires]] and other methods that rely on human memory do not accurately measure dietary intake.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Edward, Gregory Pavela, and Carl J. Lavie. "A discussion of the refutation of memory-based dietary assessment methods (M-BMs): the rhetorical defense of pseudoscientific and inadmissible evidence." In Mayo Clinic Proceedings, vol. 90, no. 12, pp. 1736-1739. Elsevier, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of the validity of the methods used by the USDA to estimate per capita calorie consumption found that these methods lack validity and the authors of this study recommend that these methods not be used to inform public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Edward, Diana M. Thomas, Samantha M. McDonald, Gregory Pavela, Carl J. Lavie, James O. Hill, and Steven N. Blair. "The Validity of US Nutritional Surveillance: USDA’s Loss-Adjusted Food Availability Data Series 1971-2010." Current problems in cardiology 41, no. 11-12 (2016): 268-292.&lt;/ref&gt; A systematic review found that only a few studies have measured the accuracy or reliability of dietary assessment methods in schoolchildren. The few studies that have been done found that schoolchildren did not accurately report foods consumed but that they did accurately report total calories consumed.&lt;ref&gt;Tugault-Lafleur, Claire N., Jennifer L. Black, and Susan I. Barr. "A Systematic Review of Methods to Assess Children's Diets in the School Context–." Advances in Nutrition 8, no. 1 (2017): 63-79.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 Guidelines were based on the Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015-scientific-report/pdfs/scientific-report-of-the-2015-dietary-guidelines-advisory-committee.pdf|format=PDF|title=Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidance Advisory Committee|website=Health.gov|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which did not rely on actual measurements of dietary intake but instead relied on memory-based dietary assessments, including interviews and surveys despite clear evidence that such methods markedly underestimate actual calorie consumption and nutrient intake.  Thus, the conclusions expressed in the Scientific Report have been criticized, and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans are considered invalid by some experts, as the DGAs rely on invalid methods and draw conclusions that do not agree with the available scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Edward, Gregory Pavela, and Carl J. Lavie. "The inadmissibility of what we eat in America and NHANES dietary data in nutrition and obesity research and the scientific formulation of national dietary guidelines." In Mayo Clinic Proceedings, vol. 90, no. 7, pp. 911-926. Elsevier, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dietary Fat Restriction===
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans have been criticized for recommending a diet that is low in total fat, and for not adequately emphasizing the harmful effect of industrially-produced trans fats.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nita Forouhi|Forouhi, Nita G.]], Ronald M. Krauss, Gary Taubes, and Walter Willett. "Dietary fat and cardiometabolic health: evidence, controversies, and consensus for guidance." BMJ 361 (2018): k2139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teicholz, Nina. The big fat surprise: why butter, meat and cheese belong in a healthy diet. Simon and Schuster, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A systematic review of 62,421 participants in 10 dietary trials found that reducing dietary fat intake had no effect on coronary heart disease and had no effect on overall mortality. The authors of this meta-analysis conclude that the available evidence from randomized controlled trials does not support the recommendation of the 2015 - 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans that people reduce their fat intake.&lt;ref&gt;Harcombe, Zoë, Julien S. Baker, James J. DiNicolantonio, Fergal Grace, and Bruce Davies. "Evidence from randomised controlled trials does not support current dietary fat guidelines: a systematic review and meta-analysis." Open Heart 3, no. 2 (2016): e000409.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dietary Salt Restriction===
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans have been criticized for recommending a diet that contains less than 2.3&amp;nbsp; grams of sodium (5.8 grams of salt/day). Notably, 95% of the world's populations have a mean intake of salt that is between 6 g and 12 g daily and evidence on the [[health effects of salt]] does not support such a severe restriction on salt intake. An analysis of dietary guidelines found that this recommendation for restriction of salt intake is not supported by evidence from randomized controlled trials nor is it supported by evidence from prospective observational studies. In fact, intake of less than 5.8 g of salt per day typically results in activation of the [[Renin–angiotensin system|renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system]], which leads to an increase in plasma lipids and increased mortality. The authors of this analysis suggest a redesign of the dietary guidelines for salt intake is needed.&lt;ref&gt;Graudal, Niels, and Gesche Jürgens. "Conflicting Evidence on Health Effects Associated with Salt Reduction Calls for a Redesign of the Salt Dietary Guidelines." Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

A Committee of the National Academies [[Institute of Medicine]] evaluated the evidence about dietary salt intake and health. Overall, the committee found evidence that higher salt intake was associate with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the Committee also found that the evidence did not support the claim that lowering sodium intake in the general population to less than 2,300&amp;nbsp;mg/day was associated with a lower risk of death nor with a higher risk of death.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nap.edu/catalog/18311/sodium-intake-in-populations-assessment-of-evidence&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcoholic Beverage Consumption===
The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting alcoholic beverages consumption to no more than 1 drink daily for women and no more than 2 drinks daily for men. The 2015 - 2020 Scientific Report of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee asserts that most studies show that moderate consumption of alcohol has been shown to be part of a beneficial dietary pattern. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of scientific studies of alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality found that consumption of up to 2 alcoholic beverages per day had no net mortality benefit compared with lifetime abstention from alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Stockwell, Tim, Jinhui Zhao, Sapna Panwar, Audra Roemer, Timothy Naimi, and Tanya Chikritzhs. "Do “moderate” drinkers have reduced mortality risk? A systematic review and meta-analysis of alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality." Journal of studies on alcohol and drugs 77, no. 2 (2016): 185-198.&lt;/ref&gt; A systematic analysis of data from the Global Burden of Disease study found that consumption of ethanol increases the risk of cancer and increases the risk of all-cause mortality, and that the level of ethanol consumption that minimizes disease is zero consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= |title=Alcohol use and burden for 195 countries and territories, 1990-2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 |journal=Lancet |volume= |issue= |pages= |date=August 2018 |pmid=30146330 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31310-2 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Guidelines recommend that people not mix alcohol and beverages containing caffeine, as this combined intake may result in greater alcohol consumption, with a greater risk of alcohol-related injury.

===Classification of honey and maple syrup as "Added sugars"===
Producers of honey and maple syrup have objected to the proposed Federal regulatory requirement that honey and maple syrup include the term "added sugar" on product labeling, despite the fact that no additional sugar is added to these products. This regulatory requirement follows from the recommendation in the 2015 - 2020 Guidelines that added sugars be limited to less than 10% of calories and that honey and maple syrup are themselves considered by federal regulators to be added sugars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-vermont-pure-outrage-over-pure-syrup-1530031226|title=In Vermont, Pure Outrage Over Pure Syrup|first=Betsy|last=McKay|date=26 June 2018|accessdate=1 July 2018|website=Wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first system of public '''education in [[Mauritania]]''' was established by the [[French colonial empires|French colonial administration]]. The first schools were largely concentrated in the sedentary communities of the [[Sénégal River|Sénégal River Valley]]. In 1950, the first teacher training school was established at [[Boutilimit]], and in 1957, the secondary school in [[Rosso]] also began training teachers. In part because public schools were concentrated in the south, black Africans enrolled in large numbers. As a result, the overwhelming majority of public school teachers were black, and the nation's secular educated class was dominated by black people.&lt;ref name=modern&gt;Berry, Laverne. "Modern Education". In [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/mrtoc.html ''Mauritania: A Country Study''] (Robert E. Handloff, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (June 1988). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===French Influence===
The few French schools located in [[nomad]]ic areas had difficulty attracting students. The [[Moors#Present-day Moors|Maures]] in particular were reluctant to accept the public schools and continued to favor purely [[Islam]]ic instruction. Gradually, however, they began to send their children to public schools, as they saw that traditional religious training was not preparing their children for life in the twentieth century. The French also experimented with "mobile schools" after [[World War II]], and in this way they provided public education for a larger number of nomads. In 1954 there were twelve so-called "tent" schools serving 241 students. At least some of these tent schools continued to function after Mauritania gained independence from France in 1960.&lt;ref name=modern/&gt;

===After Independence===
The independent government viewed secular education as one of the major methods to promote national unity, as well as a necessary step toward the development of a modern economy. It still faced shortages of funds, adequately trained teaching staff, and classroom facilities at all levels. Another teacher training school was opened in [[Nouakchott]] in 1964. School attendance was not compulsory, and in 1964-65 only 19,100 primary-school students and 1,500 secondary-school students (about 14 percent of school-age children) were enrolled. By 1985 an estimated 35 percent of primary-school-age children were enrolled in school, but only about 4 to 10 percent of eligible secondary-school-age children were enrolled. In both cases, boys heavily outnumbered girls.&lt;ref name=modern/&gt;

In 1985-86, primary-school enrollments had climbed to 140,871, and enrollments in secondary and vocational schools amounted to 34,674. The government reported a total of 878 primary schools and 44 secondary or [[vocational school|vocational institutions]]. A total of 4,336 students were enrolled in postsecondary training programs. An additional 448 students were attending the National Islamic Institute (formerly the Institute of Islamic Studies), and some 1,900 Mauritanians were enrolled in various training programs abroad. The public schools employed almost 2,900 primary teachers, 1,563 secondary and vocational teachers (412 of them foreign), and 237 postsecondary instructors, more than half of them expatriates. In 1982, the National College of Administration and the National College of Sciences opened in Nouakchott, and in 1983 nearly 1,000 students began instruction at the [[University of Nouakchott]].&lt;ref name=modern/&gt;

===Difficulties===
[[Literacy|Illiteracy]] remained a major problem and an important impediment to economic and social development. In 1985, the adult literacy rate was estimated at 17 to 25 percent, approximately half the average for [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. Nonetheless, this rate represented an improvement over the estimated 5 percent literacy rate at independence and 10 percent a decade later. Recognizing the need for a better educated work force, in 1986, the government launched a major literacy campaign and created the State Secretariat of Culture, Information, and Telecommunications to head the effort. That same year, the government reported that the number of literacy classes had already increased more than ten times over the 1985 number.&lt;ref name=modern/&gt;

At the same time, the cost of education was quite high in comparison with neighboring countries. In the mid-1980s, Mauritania was spending about US$45 million (20 percent of current expenditures) on education every year. Its costs for primary schooling were the highest per student in [[La Francophonie|francophone]] [[West Africa]], and only [[Côte d'Ivoire]] exceeded the cost per secondary pupil. These high costs were due in part to teachers' salaries, particularly those of expatriates, and to a generous system of scholarships. Planned investment in education for the years 1985 through 1988 was set at US$27 million under the Economic Recovery Program for 1985-88, an increase of less than 1 percent over the period from 1980 through 1984.&lt;ref name=modern/&gt;

===Gradual Reforms===
The French system of primary and secondary schools remained in force into the late 1980s. Over the years, however, some significant changes had been made, and others were planned. In the early 1980s, instruction in the [[Fula language|Pulaar]], Azayr ([[Soninke language|Soninke]]), and [[Wolof language|Wolof]] languages was introduced into the primary school curriculum, and [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] was emphasized at all levels. The official policy of gradually replacing French with local languages and Literary Arabic, adopted in the late 1970s, drew vigorous protests from French-speaking black Mauritanians and was abandoned within a decade.&lt;ref name=modern/&gt;

Mauritania remained critically short of skilled labor. In the mid-1980s, only about 15 percent of secondary-school students were enrolled in vocational education. To redress this situation and to raise the general level of literacy, the government encouraged the growth of private and [[Quran]]ic schools; most industrial training took place in private institutions. More important, the government also turned to the international community. In 1987 the [[World Bank]] agreed to help make Mauritania's education system more responsive to the country's development needs. Proposed changes involved expanding primary education and restructuring secondary schooling. Special attention was to be given to vocational training in areas of particular national need, such as water engineering and fisheries.&lt;ref name=modern/&gt;

==Current status==
Education is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14. In 2002, the gross primary enrollment rate was 88 percent, and the net primary enrollment rate was 68 percent. Gross and net enrollment ratios are based on the number of students formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance. In 1996, 41.8 percent of children ages 7 to 14 years were attending school. As of 2001, 61 percent of children who started primary school were likely to reach grade 5. However, a lack of adequate school facilities and teachers, particularly in rural areas, is likely to impede the full realization of the government’s goal of universal primary education in Mauritania until at least 2007.&lt;ref name=ilab&gt;"Mauritania". [http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2005/tda2005.pdf ''2005 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201190837/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2005/tda2005.pdf |date=December 1, 2006 }}. [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]], [[U.S. Department of Labor]] (2006). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Public school is free, but other costs such as books and lunches make education unaffordable for many poor children. Ongoing challenges to the provision of quality education in Mauritania include high dropout and repetition rates, inadequate curriculum, and a poor national infrastructure that prevents children from traveling to and from school. In 2002, a World Food Program (WFP) survey of out-of-school children in Mauritania found that 25 percent did not attend school due to the need to support their families or perform domestic work, and another 22 percent did not attend due to the distance to school.  &lt;ref name=ilab/&gt;

{{Expand German|Waldpädagogik|date=June 2017}}

'''Forest school,''' is a [[outdoor education]] delivery model in which children (or adults) visit natural spaces to learn personal, social and technical skills. It has been defined as "an inspirational process that offers children, young people and adults regular opportunities to achieve and develop confidence through hands-on learning in a woodland environment".&lt;ref name="fsrs"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/pdf/SERG_Forest_School_research_summary.pdf/$FILE/SERG_Forest_School_research_summary.pdf|title=Forest School Research Summary|year=2008|publisher=Forest Research|last=O'Brien|first=Liz|last2=Murray|first2=Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest school is both a [[pedagogy]] and a physical entity, with the use often being interchanged. The plural "schools" is often used when referring to a number of groups or sessions.  There is no single definition of "forest school", and as of 2018 known attempts to commercialize the term via trademark or copyright have been unsuccessful.

Forest school uses the woods and forests as a means to build independence and [[self-esteem]] in children and young adults.Topics are cross-curriculum (broad in subject) including the natural environment, for example the role of trees in society, the complex ecosystem supported by a wilderness, and recognition of specific plants and animals. However, the personal skills are considered highly valuable, such as teamwork and problem solving.&lt;ref name="What is Forest School?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestschoolassociation.org/what-is-forest-school|publisher=Forest School Association|title=What is Forest School}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woodland environment may be used to learn about more abstract concepts such as mathematics and communication. Forest school provision is also called ''nature schools''.

== Activities and scope ==

In the UK Model schedules within forest schools vary, but one approach is to take school learners to woodland for once a week, with an initial 6 week observation and assessment period, where a baseline is produced for each child in terms of areas of their holistic development, with particular emphasis on their social and emotional aspects of learning (SEAL). Once the baseline assessment has been produced the Forest School Leader / Practitioner will then continue with the long term programme over the course of the learning period in order to support the child in their development and learning. The practitioner will provide opportunities for each child to develop in areas that have been identified as requiring interventions or support of any kind&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = A guide to Forest School in Wales|url = http://www.forestschoolleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/AguidetoForestSchoolsinWales.pdf|year = 2009|publisher = Forestry Commission Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duration and frequency of visits influences the degree of outcome; more time spent in forest school brings greater benefits.&lt;ref name="review-outdoor"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.field-studies-council.org/documents/general/NFER/A_review_of_research_on_outdoor_learning.pdf| title=A Review of Research on Outdoor Learning| last=Rickinson| first=Mark| last2=Dillon|first2=Justin| last3=Teamey| first3=Kelly| publisher=National Foundation for Educational Research and King's College London| date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visits should ideally continue throughout the year, allowing children to experience all weathers and the changing seasons.

Forest schools are for all learners, of any age, often "led by the learner`s interests" (learner initiated learning) by comparison to other [[outdoor education]] which "starts with an issue agenda or problem for the learner to investigate".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Massey|first=Sam|title=The Benefits of a Forest School Experience for Children in their Early Years|url=http://www.forestschoolleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Massey-benefits-of-forest-school-research.pdf|publisher=National Foundation for Educational Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main goals of forest school in primary  age children includes encouraging curiosity and exploration with all of the senses, empowering children in the natural environment, and encouraging spatial awareness and motor development.&lt;ref name="What is Forest School?" /&gt; Forest schools usually provide a higher adult to child ratio than some learning styles, in order to ensure children are supported sufficiently in a higher risk environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forestschoolassociation.org/history-of-forest-school/&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond primary school age children, forest school is frequently used to further develop social skills and explore creative learning and focuses on developing firm foundations for continued personal and education development.  In particular it has been used as an alternative curriculum provision to support continued mainstream education involvement, or as a temporary/transitional approach back into school.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Consistent with [[attention restoration theory]], children taking part in forest school have been described as more relaxed.&lt;ref name="woodsforlearning"/&gt; Relationships between the children and each other, with adults, and with the environment, are important&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.greenlighttrust.org/Forest%20Schools/ARU%20Conference%20Paper%2019042007%20-%20Sara%20Bond.doc|title=Forest School: relational pedagogy in action|date=April 2007|place=Anglia Ruskin University|booktitle=Reclaiming Relational Pedagogy in Early Childhood: Learning from International Experience|last=Bond|first=Sara|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726131909/http://www.greenlighttrust.org/Forest%20Schools/ARU%20Conference%20Paper%2019042007%20-%20Sara%20Bond.doc|archivedate=2011-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest school is part of the broader area of [[outdoor education]]. Outside the school curriculum, this extends to summer holiday camps, [[Scouting]], Outward Bound projects and many other activities. Before children reach school age, [[Forest kindergarten]]s provide a similar service.

Forest school is currently taking place in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, USA, Malaysia, Switzerland, Spain, Ireland, Germany and United Kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

== Supporting Children With Exceptionalities  ==

The combination of freedom and responsibility has been particularly beneficial to children who suffer from lack of confidence or whose behaviour is challenging. With high adult:child ratios, children can safely experience activities that are often prohibited, such as climbing trees or lighting fires.Children have the freedom to explore the area within the forest, this helps the child to learn to manage their own safety and move around comfortably.&lt;ref name="Knight, S 2009"&gt;Knight, S (2009) Forest schools and outdoor learning in the early years. London, SAGE publications&lt;/ref&gt; The programme allows children to grow in confidence and independence and extend their abilities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Some children do not perform well in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6KhhF091QZEC&amp;pg=PA77|page=77|title=Developing children's behaviour in the classroom: a practical guide for Teachers and Students|first=Sonia|last=Burnard|publisher=Falmer Press|year=1998|isbn=0-7507-0722-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are encouraged to develop their innate curiosity and develop the motivation to learn.&lt;ref&gt;Brien, L; Murray,R (2006)A marvellous opportunity for children to learn [http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fr0112forestschoolsreport.pdf/$FILE/fr0112forestschoolsreport.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; They may come from a non-academic family background, may have a short [[attention span]], or may just not be comfortable with the organisation of a teacher standing in front of a group of pupils. Boys in general, prefer to be outside, and learn better in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Sax L.

== History ==

=== Sweden and Denmark ===

In the 1950s the idea was created in Denmark and shortly there after in Sweden. In Denmark it became an embedded part of the curriculum for pre-school children (under seven years) stemming from their småbørnspædagogik, or 'Early childhood education'. Children attending Forest kindergartens were in most cases arriving at school with strong social skills, the ability to work in groups effectively, high self-esteem, and confidence in their own capabilities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In 1957, a [[Sweden|Swedish]] man, Goesta Frohm, created the "Skogsmulle" concept to promote learning about nature, water, mountains and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skogsmullestiftelsen.org/eng/index.htm Skogsmulle Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; With an increasing focus on measurable outcomes, forest schools have gained acceptance as an educational method in their own right. In Denmark, nature schools as well as [[forest kindergarten]]s are popular with both school teachers and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Fuks|first=Vlada|url=http://diggy.ruc.dk/bitstream/1800/334/1/Environmental_education_and.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620232945/http://diggy.ruc.dk/bitstream/1800/334/1/Environmental_education_and.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-06-20|title=Environmental Education and Nature Schools in Denmark|year=2004|publisher=Roskilde University, Denmark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[biophilia hypothesis]] argues that a love of nature is instinctive. The term [[nature deficit disorder]], coined by Richard Louv in his 2005 book ''Last Child in the Woods'', recognises the erosion of this by the urbanisation of human society. [[Attention restoration theory]] and related psychological work has proven health benefits in reduced stress, improved concentration and improved medical outcomes from surgery. Scandinavian countries, rich in woodland, have maintained the human link more closely. Forest schools practice is based on up-to date pedagogy and andragogy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

=== United Kingdom ===
  
This ethos was introduced to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] during the 1990s from Denmark. The growth of forest school has been unprecedented throughout the UK developing into a separate and distinct model called the UK Model. [[Bridgwater College]] in Somerset was the pioneer of the forest school concept in the UK in 1994 after traveling to Denmark to observe the Danish/Nordic Model of Forest Kindergartens for a few days.&lt;ref name="Knight, S 2009"/&gt;

Various government and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] agencies propose the use of woodland as part of the school educational curriculum; for example the Forest Education Initiative&lt;ref name="fei"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresteducation.org/forest_schools.php?page=1|title=What is an FEI Forest School?|publisher=Forest Education Initiative|year=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201053814/http://www.foresteducation.org/forest_schools.php?page=1|archivedate=2010-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Forestry Commission]].&lt;ref name="woodsforlearning"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-6cjdgl|title=Woods for Learning Education Strategy|year=2005|publisher=Forestry Commission Scotland|isbn=0-85538-684-3|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912012111/http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-6cjdgl|archivedate=2009-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006, there were approximately 140 forest schools in Britain.&lt;ref name="fsrs"/&gt;

The governmental agencies have in some cases been set targets for the use of their resources for education or health benefits,&lt;ref name="woodsforlearning"/&gt; or are focused on the educational outcomes and see forestry as a step towards them.&lt;ref name="earlyyearsframework"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/257007/0076309.pdf#page=31|title=Early Years Framework|publisher=Scottish Government|isbn=978-0-7559-5942-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many businesses and non-profit organizations facilitate forest school long term programmes. In [[Wales]], training and strategic oversight is provided by Forest Schools Wale] and government agencies such as the [[Forestry Commission]] who have supported research and the development of practical experience for forest school practitioners. In [[England]], support has been provided by the Forest Education Network (which has replaced the Forest Education Initiative) to those initiating forest school provision. Such provision is provided within schools using their own trained staff or by external independent forest school providers.

Many organisations now offer training courses designed for the UK to enable practitioners to deliver forest school in their own settings and ensure children and teachers work within rich natural experiences.{{cn|date=September 2018}} The OCN Level 3 training course is most widely recognised within the UK.

Developing from the Institute of Outdoor Learning's (IOL) Forest School Special Interest Group, in June 2012 The Forest School Association was established as an independent UK body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestschoolassociation.org/history-of-forest-school/|title=History of Forest School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Inspired by international developments, the first Canadian forest school was created by Marlene Power in 2007. It was named Carp Ridge Preschool and was located near Ottawa.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacEachren|first=Zabe|date=Autumn 2013|title=The Canadian Forest School Movement|url=http://www.learninglandscapes.ca/index.php/learnland/issue/view/33/Vol%207%20No%201%20%282013%29%3A%20Early%20Childhood%20Education%3A%20Successes%20and%20Challenges|journal=LEARNing Landscapes|volume=7|pages=219–233|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Power founded and became the executive director of Forest School Canada, an educational initiative of the Child and Nature Alliance of Canada.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forest and Nature School in Canada|last=|first=|publisher=Forest School Canada|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=1–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest School Canada is focused on being a "network for support, education, and accreditation for concepts associated with the FS movement in Canada."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The movement has spread into Canada's provinces and is primary associated with private schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, there is emerging support from public schools such as the Nature Kindergarten pilot which is a partnership between the Sooke District School Board and the University of Victoria’s Centre for Early Childhood Research and Policy, Royal Roads University, and Camosun College’s Early Learning and Care Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://naturekindergarten.sd62.bc.ca/proposal/|title=Proposal for a Nature Kindergarten {{!}} Nature Kindergarten|website=naturekindergarten.sd62.bc.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of Terminology ==
Attempts have been made to [[copyright]] and [[trademark]] generic terms related to forest school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade marking terms that are generic within the Forest School sector|url=http://www.forestschoolassociation.org/trade-marking-terms-that-are-generic-within-the-forest-school-sector/|accessdate=16 May 2014|author=Forest School Association|date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no known protection of the term "forest school" or "forest schools".

'''HINARI Access to Research in Health Programme''' was set up by the [[World Health Organization]] and major publishers to enable developing countries to access collections of biomedical and health literature. There are up to 13,000 e-journals and up to 29,000 online books available to health institutions in more than 100 countries. HINARI is part of Research4Life, the collective name for four programs - HINARI (focusing on health), [[AGORA]] (focusing on agriculture), [[OARE]] (focusing on environment), and [[ARDI]] (focusing on applied science and technology).&lt;ref name= "LancetR4L"&gt;{{cite web |title= Our commitment to universal access to medical research § About Research4Life |url= http://www.thelancet.com/hinari |publisher= ''[[The Lancet]]'' |accessdate= 2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, Research4Life provides developing countries with free or low cost access to academic and professional peer-reviewed content online.&lt;ref name= "LancetR4L"/&gt;

The HINARI program, and the other programs, were reviewed for the second time in 2010 and the publishers involved have committed to continuing with it until at least 2020. HINARI has received the high honor of the [[Medical Library Association]]'s 2015 Louise Darling Medal for Collection Development in the Health Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.medicine.yale.edu/blog/mla-awards-2015-louise-darling-medal-yale-partner-hinari|title=MLA awards 2015 Louise Darling Medal to Yale partner HINARI|last=Hickner|first=Andy|website=The Cushing/Whitney Medical Library|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In response to a call by the then UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] and to a statement issued by [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] the then Director General World Health Organization, HINARI was launched in July 2001 with a statement of intent from six major publishers: [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell Publishing]], [[Elsevier]], the [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt]], [[Wolters Kluwer]], [[Springer Science+Business Media]], and [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]].&lt;ref name= "intent"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/hinari/statementofintent/en/ |title= Publishers' Statement of Intent |date= 2001-07-09 |location= London |work= HINARI |publisher= [[World Health Organization]] |accessdate= 2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The HINARI name began as an acronym of Health Inter-Network Access to Research Initiative.&lt;ref name= "Sarin2007"/&gt; The use of the full name was later abandoned.  The program opened for use in January 2002 with around 1,500 journals from the initial six publishers.&lt;ref name= "Harris2007"/&gt; {{As of|2015}}, there are almost 200 publisher partners providing their online publications through HINARI.&lt;ref name= "partners"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://extranet.who.int/hinari/en/partners.php?category=publisher |title= Partners § Publishers |work= HINARI |publisher= [[World Health Organization]] |accessdate= 2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3,750 journal titles were accessible via HINARI in 2007.&lt;ref name= "Sarin2007"/&gt; Critiques of HINARI argue that the low-cost model is still too high for many institutions and journals with top [[impact factor]]s are not included in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Villafuerte-Gálvez|first=Javier|last2=Curioso|first2=Walter H|last3=Gayoso|first3=Oscar|title=Biomedical Journals and Global Poverty: Is HINARI a Step Backwards?|url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040220|journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=4|issue=6|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040220|pmc=1896213|pmid=17594171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility==
Eligible categories of institutions are: national universities, professional schools (medicine, nursing, pharmacy, public health, dentistry), research institutes, teaching hospitals and healthcare centers, government offices, national medical libraries and local non-governmental organizations.&lt;ref name= "eligibility"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/hinari/eligibility/en/index.html |title= Eligibility |work= HINARI |publisher= [[World Health Organization]] |accessdate= 2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
The country lists are based on four factors: Total GNI (World Bank figures), GNI per capita (World Bank figures), United Nations Least Developed Country (LDCs) List and Human Development Index (HDI).&lt;ref name= "criteria"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.who.int/hinari/eligibility/Details_eligibility/en/ |title= Criteria by which countries, areas, or territories are categorized |work= HINARI |publisher= [[World Health Organization]] |accessdate= 2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 users and members of eligible institutions in 113 countries had access.&lt;ref name= "Sarin2007"/&gt; In 2016, the number of eligible countries, areas and territories stood at 117.&lt;ref name= "eligibility"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some large, emerging countries including [[India]] and [[China]] are excluded by the program because their total GNI exceeds US$1 trillion.&lt;ref name= "Sarin2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Sarin |first= R |year= 2007 |title= Denying open access to published health-care research: WHO has the password? |journal= [[Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics]] |volume= 3 |issue= 3 |pages = 133–4 |doi= 10.4103/0973-1482.37403 |pmid= 18079573 |url= http://www.cancerjournal.net/text.asp?2007/3/3/133/37403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Harris2007"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.researchinformation.info/features/feature.php?feature_id=136 |title= Training increases HINARI and AGORA benefits |magazine= Research Information |publisher= Europa Science |department= Digital Divide |date= June–July 2007 |last= Harris |first= Siân |accessdate= 2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="criteria"/&gt;

'''Hampshire College''' is a private [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]], [[Massachusetts]]. It was opened in 1970 as an experiment in alternative education, in association with four other colleges in the [[Pioneer Valley]]: [[Amherst College]], [[Smith College]], [[Mount Holyoke College]], and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. Together they have since been known as the [[Five Colleges (Massachusetts)|Five Colleges]] or the [[Five College Consortium]].

The college is widely known for its alternative curriculum, socially liberal politics, focus on portfolios rather than [[distribution requirements]], and its reliance on [[narrative evaluations]] instead of grades and [[GPA]]s. In some fields, it is among the top undergraduate institutions in percentage of graduates who enroll in graduate school. Sixty-five percent of its alumni have at least one graduate degree and a quarter have founded their own business or organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Success After Hampshire|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/admissions/student-outcomes|website=Hampshire College}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is ranked #39 among U.S. [[colleges]] and [[universities]] by the percentage of graduates who go on to earn a [[doctorate degree]] according to [[National Science Foundation]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hampshire.edu/news/2018/01/23/hampshire-a-top-40-college-for-alums-earning-a-doctorate-federal-data-reveals |title=Hampshire a Top-40 College for Alums Earning a Doctorate, Federal Data Reveals |publisher=Hampshire College }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The idea for Hampshire College originated in 1958 when the presidents of Amherst, Mount Holyoke, and Smith Colleges, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, appointed a committee to examine the assumptions and practices of liberal arts education. Their report, "The New College Plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/sites/default/files/archives/files/NewColl.pdf |title=Data |website=www.hampshire.edu |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; ", advocated many of the features that have since been realized in the Hampshire curriculum: inviting students to self-design their program of studies; training students to be able to educate themselves through their lifetimes; emphasis on each student's curiosity and motivation; learning among and across multiple disciplines; and close mentoring relationships with teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New College Plan, 1958|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/library/chapter-1-precursors#11B|website=Hampshire College Archives|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Amherst College alumnus Harold F. Johnson, inspired by the New College Plan, donated $6 million toward the founding of Hampshire College. With a matching grant from the Ford Foundation, Hampshire's first trustees purchased {{convert|800|acre|km2}} of orchard and farmland in South Amherst, Massachusetts, and construction began.

One of the most significant founding documents of Hampshire College is the book ''The Making of a College'' (MIT Press, 1967; {{ISBN|0-262-66005-9}}), co-written by the College's first president, Franklin Patterson, together with Hampshire's founding employee from Amherst College who would become its second president, Chuck Longsworth.  ''The Making of a College'' is (as of 2003) out of print but available in electronic form from the Hampshire College Archives.&lt;ref name="Making of a College"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.hampshire.edu/archives/3881.htm |title=Making of a College |edition=1975 |accessdate=January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hampshire admitted its first students in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Acquiring Land for the New College {{!}} www.hampshire.edu|url = https://www.hampshire.edu/library/acquiring-land-for-the-new-college|website = www.hampshire.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years immediately after its founding in the early 1970s, the large number of applications for matriculation caused Hampshire College to be among the most selective undergraduate programs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Making of a College'' pp. 307–310.&lt;/ref&gt; Its admissions selectivity declined thereafter because of declining application popularity. The school's number of applications increased again in the late 1990s, causing increased admissions selectivity since then. The college's rate of admissions is now comparable to that of many other small liberal arts colleges.

The school has been financially challenged through much of its history, in large part because it lacked a founding endowment to rely on for stability of income, and it has relied substantially on tuition income for operations. As of June 30, 2017, the endowment had risen to $48.5 million.&lt;ref name="Hampshire College"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.hampshire.edu/sites/default/files/businessoffice/files/031918financials1617FNL.pdf | title = Hampshire College Financial Report 2016-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the school has been on more solid financial footing, though still lacking a sizable endowment. In recent years its financial stability has relied on fundraising efforts led by its most recent president, [[Jonathan Lash]].

In the mid-1990s, the college began establishing a "cultural village" making possible the residence of independent non-profit organizations on its campus. The cultural village&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampshire College Welcomes Hitchcock Center to its Cultural Village|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/news/2016/10/01/hampshire-college-welcomes-hitchcock-center-for-the-environment-to-its-cultural|website=Hampshire College|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes the [[National Yiddish Book Center]], the [[Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art]] and The Hitchcock Center for the Environment.

[[File:Hampshire College logo.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|'''The 'H' logo''' of Hampshire College, used separately from the seal. The four colored bars represent the other four colleges that formed Hampshire.]]

[[Adele Simmons]] served as the College's third president, from 1977 to 1989, the longest tenure of any Hampshire President. Gregory Prince served as its fourth president, from 1989 to 2005.

On April 1, 2004, Prince announced his retirement, effective at the end of the 2004–2005 academic year. On April 5, 2005, the Board of Trustees named [[Ralph Hexter]], formerly a dean at [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s College of Letters and Science, as the college's next president, effective August 1, 2005.  Hexter was inaugurated on October 15, 2005. The appointment made Hampshire one of a small number of colleges and universities in the United States with an openly [[gay]] president.&lt;ref&gt;The exact number was unclear, but there may have been as few as eight openly gay college and university presidents {{As of|2007|lc=on}}, and at the time Hexter was named president of Hampshire there were fewer still.

''Inside Higher Ed'' January 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Marlene Gerber Fried was interim president for one year from 2010 to 2011. [[Jonathan Lash]] was named the sixth president of the College in May, 2011, joining Hampshire as an internationally recognized expert on global sustainability, climate change, and environmental challenges and solutions. He has been appointed by two US Presidents to serve on a national environmental council and commission. Lash served a long tenure until 2018, and is followed by the College's seventh president, [[Miriam Nelson]], beginning her appointment in July, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miriam Nelson, Prominent U.S. Health Scholar, Educator, and Policy Adviser, Named President of Hampshire|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/news/2018/04/17/miriam-nelson-prominent-us-health-scholar-educator-and-policy-adviser-named|website=Hampshire College|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hampshire College Archives in the Harold F. Johnson Library has extensively documented the College's history between 1965 and 2005, accessible on the College's Website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampshire College Documentary Histories|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/library/the-documentary-histories-of-hampshire-college|website=Hampshire College Archives|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 2012, the school announced the establishment of a scholarship fund dedicated to helping undocumented students get degrees. It would give more than $25,000 each year to help an undocumented student pay for the $43,000-plus tuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Shannon|title=MASS.

==18th Century Proposal for a College in Hampshire County (unrelated)==

Around 1761, an idea for a new college with a different system was debated among settlers and the Massachusetts government.  They proposed calling the new institution Hampshire college which, if successful, would have been completely different from Hampshire College today.   A group of 74 people in [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire County]] expressed interest in establishing a new college to train their ministers and civil leaders since the other colleges were expensive and far away.  Furthermore, they wanted to establish a system that followed their moral standards and was free of religion.  Their proposal was denied by the Massachusetts government in attempt to avoid a competition with Harvard College.  At the time, Harvard College was recognized by the state as the most suitable college for training ministers; it was feared a new college would weaken Harvard.  The group then sought assistance from [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Lord Jeffry Amherst]] who also declined support as to not question the Massachusetts government.&lt;ref name="The Proposed College in Hampshire County in 1762,"&gt;{{citation|title=The Proposed College in Hampshire County in 1762|url=https://dspace.hampshire.edu/bitstream/10009/560/2/APRE.pdf|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics and resources==

=== Curriculum ===
Hampshire College describes itself as "experimenting" rather than "experimental", to emphasize the changing nature of its curriculum. From its inception, the curriculum has generally had certain non-traditional features:
* An emphasis on ''project work'' as well as, or instead of, courses
* Detailed [[narrative evaluations|''written evaluations'']] (as well as portfolio evaluations) for completed courses and projects, rather than letter or number grades
* A curriculum centered on ''student interests'', with students taking an active role in designing their own concentrations and projects
* An emphasis on independent motivation and student organization, both within and without the college's formal curriculum

[[File:emilydickinsonhall.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Emily Dickinson]] Hall, designed by the architecture firm of former faculty member [[Norton Juster]], houses much of the humanities, creative writing, and theatre]]

The curriculum is divided into three "divisions" rather than four grade-years:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampshire's Academic Program|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/academics/the-academic-program|website=Hampshire College|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Division I: Exploration and Working Across Disciplines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampshire College Division I|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/academics/division-i|website=Hampshire College|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Division I, the student, mentored by a professor as adviser:
a) Completes a minimum of four courses from five broad distribution areas. 
* Arts, Design, and Media
* Culture, Humanities, and Languages (language study strongly encouraged for those planning to study abroad)
* Mind, Brain, and Information
* Physical and Biological Sciences 
* Power, Community, and Social Justice
b) Completes three elective courses from Hampshire or the Five Colleges. Independent study and special projects are allowed with adviser approval. 
c) Completes a community-engaged learning activity, devoting 40 hours to campus life
d) Submits a year-end portfolio of work and faculty evaluations from courses and electives, including an essay reflecting on Division I, and receives a final written evaluation from the adviser.

*Division II: Concentration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampshire College Division II|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/academics/division-ii|website=Hampshire College|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (typically years 2 and 3)
Drawing on resources at Hampshire and the Five Colleges and advised by a committee of two faculty members, the student: 
a) Designs a concentration, starting by writing a plan for four semesters of work that sets out their questions for exploration and goals for developing expertise in the concentration. The plan may be similar to a traditional college major or an original, individualized program encompassing multiple fields, disciplines, and Schools. The plan is considered a contract negotiated with the committee, and may be revised periodically. It may include courses and other activities — independent study/research, community-based learning, internships, study abroad, social action, lab work, teaching/research assistantships, etc. The minimum number of evaluated activities is 12.
b) Fulfills a Multiple Cultural Perspectives requirement by completing a course/learning activity centered on an exploration of non-Western perspectives, the roles of race and racism in the U.S., or the dynamics of knowledge, power, and privilege. 
c) Fulfills a community-engaged learning requirement by devoting at least 40 hours to addressing a community need by volunteering with a community partner; serving an internship, assistantship, or mentorship; completing a course with a community component.

To complete Division II, the student compiles and presents a portfolio to the committee, curating the academic work and reflecting on its meaning and on learning. The portfolio consists of selected works (in any medium), evaluations from courses/learning activities, and a Division II reflection, demonstrating that the student has fulfilled the contract. The student receives a final committee evaluation.

*Division III: Creating Knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampshire College Division III|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/academics/division-iii|website=Hampshire College|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The student forms a committee of at least two faculty members and designs an original, yearlong advanced-study project, one that will demonstrate the student’s ability to handle complex questions, concepts, and skills. The student submits the plan as a contract including a description of the purpose and substantive nature of the project; the approach and techniques to be applied; resources and facilities to be employed; and the form the final project will take. The student meets with the committee regularly to report on progress. Faculty will provide reviews, critiques, and guidance throughout and must find the work sufficient to graduate with a bachelor of arts degree.

To successfully complete Division III, the student must: 
a) Complete the Division III project
b) Complete at least two advanced learning activities (e.g. courses at the 300 level or above, a teaching assistantship, an internship, or another activity that broadens the scope of the student’s intellectual endeavor and engages the campus or community at large.

The student submits the final capstone project, performance, presentation, or paper, and meets for the last time with the committee. Committee members write an evaluation of the Division III.

===Schools and programs===

In 2014 Hampshire announced the formation of a new concentration, in Psychoanalytic Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/news/2014/02/21/feb-27-announcement-of-the-new-concentration-in-psychoanalytic-studies-at-hampshire|title=Announcement of the new concentration|accessdate=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Five College Consortium===

Hampshire College is the youngest of the schools in the Five-College Consortium. The other schools are [[Amherst College]], [[Mt. Holyoke College]], [[Smith College]] and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fivecolleges.edu/|title=www.fivecolleges.edu|work=fivecolleges.edu|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students at each of the schools may take classes and borrow books at the other schools, generally without paying additional fees. They may use resources at the other schools, including internet access, dining halls, and so forth. The five colleges collectively offer over 5,300 courses, and the five libraries have over eight million books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fivecolleges.edu/libraries/|title=Libraries - www.fivecolleges.edu|work=fivecolleges.edu|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA) operates bus services between the schools and the greater [[Pioneer Valley]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pvta.com/|title=Pioneer Valley Transit Authority of Western Massachusetts|work=pvta.com|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two joint departments in the five-college consortium: Dance and Astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five College Academic Opportunities|url=https://www.fivecolleges.edu/academics/departments_programs|website=https://www.fivecolleges.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability==

===The R.W. Kern Center===
Opened on April 26, 2017, the R.W. Kern Center is the 17th Living Building in the world certified under the advanced green-building standard, the [[Living Building Challenge]].  The building cost $10.4 million made possible by private donations.  It operates net-zero energy, water, and waste. The building is powered by solar panels on its roof, supplies its own drinking water by harvesting rainwater from its roof, manages its wastewater on site, and contains composting toilets.  The Kern Center was built using materials from local sources without the use of any toxic "red list" materials; even materials such as duct tape were chosen carefully to comply with strict environmental standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampshire College Earns Living Building Certification for R.W.

President Jonathan Lash stated that "[w]ith this building we have sought to reflect our values, in the inclusive design process, the design and materials, our construction practices, and our reporting about the building... [w]hy are buildings constructed any other way? In every way, the Kern Center was built to learn and teach.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/news/2016/02/29/hampshire-announces-ribbon-cutting-opening-ceremony-for-kern-center|title=Hampshire Announces Ribbon-Cutting Opening Ceremony for Kern Center|work=hampshirecollege.edu|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/02/20/hampshire-college-sustainability-efforts-reach-new-level/GZNOj27sHcdGxhWAia9fCJ/story.html|title=At Hampshire College, sustainability efforts reach new level|work=bostonglobe.com|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate Action Plan ===

[[File:Hampshire College's solar panel field October 2017.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|The solar panel field at Hampshire College]]
Hampshire College will soon become the first college in the United States to be 100% solar powered, a milestone for the college.  They wait for permission to switch to full operation of its solar energy.  The solar panel array is a part of the college's main goal - to be climate-neutral by 2020 according to their extensive Climate Action Plan developed in April 2012.  They begain construction in February 2015. Two witness tests were conducted in June 2017 and its final one conducted November 2017.  Since June 2017, a part of the solar array has been powering the college.  The solar panels cover 19 acres consisting of 15,000 panels which will eventually produce 4.7 megawatts of power each year.  Hampshire College contracted with SolarCity to install the panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
https://www.hampshire.edu/news/2017/12/01/hampshire-conducts-final-test-for-100-solar-campus|title=Hampshire Conducts Final Test for 100% Solar Campus|work=hampshirecollege.edu|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college will save up to $8 million in electricity cost in 20 years and $400,000 yearly.  4.7 megawatts of solar power eliminates 3,000 metric tons of greenhouse-gas emissions per year which is equivalent to 650 less cars on the road.  Other solar sources on campus contribute to the main solar array: the Kern Center rooftop solar arrays, the CSA Barn, the president's house, and the Longworth Arts Center canopy atop solar panels. The president stated that "[t]his is the challenge that our students and every other student is going to face in the next 20 years, how to turn the US economy into a low-carbon economy ... and they're going to get the real firsthand experience of doing it. So that was reason number one.” The president has declared that switching to renewable energy is "just the right thing to do in an era of accelerating climate change."  He also noted this project will keep jobs local and prevent "pipelines being built through people's communities to get power to our college."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

In the next 20 years, the college plans to reduce 50% of current consumption of energy, another major goal stated in their Climate Action Plan.  They plan to renovate the Robert Crown Center, Library, Cole Science Center, Franklin Patterson Hall, Merrill House, and Greenwich House.  Their plan is possible by a $1 million gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

===Timeline of Sustainability Initiative===

[[File:MapleSugarShack.jpg|thumb|The Maple Sugar Shack]]
Since 2011, Hampshire College has been involved in various projects to "transform its food systems, campus operations, curriculum and campus culture to embrace sustainability." The college's advances in sustainability include various projects.  In 2011, the college was the first in the world to divest from fossil-fuels.  In 2012, they developed the Climate Action Plan for climate neutrality by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/sustainable/climate-action-plan|title=Climate Action Plan|last=|first=|date=|website=hampshirecollege.edu|access-date=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hampshire College Farm expanded their education and operation, establishing the Center for New England and Agriculture. In 2014 the main traffic circle and parking lot was eliminated and turned into a meadow.  They also stopped mowing dozen acres of lawns in hopes of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, saving landscaping expenses and creating wildlife and plant habitats.  In the same year, they installed an electric car-charging station behind the library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/news/2014/03/26/charging-station-for-electric-vehicles-at-hampshire-college|title=Charging Station for Electric Vehicles at Hampshire College|work=hampshirecollege.edu|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015 they permanently protected 46 acres of their property through a conservation restriction. The Kern Center became their first 100% emission-free building in 2016 and the Hitchcock Center for the Environment built its new living building on Hampshire land. In 2017, Hampshire College pledged to continue to support climate action and reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement.  They signed the We Are Still In campaign along with 2,600 total signers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

==Prominent campus issues==

===Re-Radicalization===
In the spring of 2004, a student group calling itself ''Re-Radicalization of Hampshire College (Re-Rad)'' emerged with a [[manifesto]] called ''The Re-Making of a College'', which critiqued what they saw as a betrayal of Hampshire's founding ideas in alternative education and student-centered learning.  On May 3, 2004, the group staged a demonstration that packed the hall outside the President's office during an administrative meeting.  Response from the community was generally amicable and Re-Rad made some progress.

[[File:Hampshire College Yurt.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[Yurt]] is home to Hampshire's student radio station]]

The Re-Radicalization movement was responding in part to a new "First-Year Plan" that changed the structure of the first year of study.  Beginning in the Fall of 2002, the requirements for passing Division I were changed so that first-year students no longer had to complete independent projects (see Curriculum above). Re-Rad submitted its own counter-proposal in both 2006 and 2007, but these proposals were not acted on, and no follow-up was attempted.

The Re-Radicalization of Hampshire College assisted the administration in launching a pilot program known as ''mentored independent study''. This program paired ten third semester students with Division III students with similar academic interests to complete a small study—observed by, and subject to the approval of, a faculty member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Re-Rad - Hampedia|url = https://hampedia.org/wiki/Re-rad#History_of_the_Movement|website = hampedia.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some students worry about what they see as Hampshire's headlong plunge into normality, the circumstances of Hampshire's founding tends to perennially attract students who revive the questions about education the institution was founded on, and who challenge the administration to honor the founding mission. Unsurprisingly, then, Re-Rad was not the first student push of its type. Similar efforts have sprung up at Hampshire with some regularity, with varying impacts. In 1996, student Chris Kawecki spearheaded a similar push called the Radical Departure, calling for a more holistic, organic integration of education into students' lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://peterchristopher.com/peterchristopher/ed/xp/ The Experimental Program In Education and Community Peter Christopher Document Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715065503/http://peterchristopher.com/peterchristopher/ed/xp/ |date=July 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most durable legacy of the Radical Departure was EPEC, a series of student-led non-credit courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hampshire.edu/studentlife/5897.htm|title=Experimental Program in Education and Community (EPEC)|work=hampshire.edu|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more detailed account of movements such as these can be found in a history of Hampshire student activities, an account written by alumnus Timothy Shary (F86) that was commissioned by Community Council in 1990; he has subsequently been a faculty member at [[Clark University]] of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]],  and the [[University of Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ou.edu/fvs/faculty/shary.htm Timothy Shary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223025519/http://www.ou.edu/fvs/faculty/shary.htm |date=February 23, 2009 }}, University of Oklahoma, Faculty of Film &amp; Video Studies Faculty. &lt;br&gt; [http://www.ou.edu/fvs/faculty/Shary%20CV%2010%2022%2007.doc Timothy Shary, Curriculum Vitae] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223074102/http://www.ou.edu/fvs/faculty/Shary%20CV%2010%2022%2007.doc |date=February 23, 2009 }} (MS Word)&lt;br&gt; Note in the CV: Keynote Speech: ''Activating the History in Student Activities,'' delivered at Hampshire College History Day, Amherst, MA, April 29, 2000.

In May 1977, Hampshire was the first college in the nation to divest from [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hampshire.edu/archives/3406.htm Volume 2, 1975–1985, Chapter 6: Divestment] Hampshire College Archives&lt;/ref&gt; The college removed $39,000 in stocks in four companies.  Legal and financial research undertaken by student Michael Current and faculty member Kurtis Gordon was promoted nationally by business activists Douglas Tooley and Debbie Knight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/hampshire-college-students-campaign-divestment-south-africa-us-1977|title=Hampshire College students win divestment from apartheid South Africa, U.S., 1977 {{!}} Global Nonviolent Action Database|website=nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009 it was reported that Hampshire College had divested from Israel because of its violation of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/12/hampshire-college-divests_n_166528.html|title=Hampshire College Divests From Israel|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under pressure from pro-Israel groups and high-profile individuals, most notably attorney [[Alan Dershowitz]], the father of a Hampshire alumnus, Hampshire's president stated that the changes in investments were not politically motivated.  Hampshire continues to display a statement from Dershowitz on its website, in which the lawyer withdraws his criticism and pledges his support, stating, "Hampshire has now done the right thing. It has made it unequivocally clear that it did not and will not divest from Israel. Indeed, it will continue to hold stock in companies that do business with Israel as well as with Israeli companies...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=College|first1=Hampshire|title=Public Statement by Alan Dershowitz|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/news/2009/02/24/public-statement-by-alan-dershowitz|website=hampshire.edu|accessdate=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2001, a controversial All-Community Vote at Hampshire declared the school opposed to the recently launched [[War on Terrorism]], another national first that drew national media attention, including scathing reports from [[Fox News Channel]] and the ''[[New York Post]]'' ("Kooky College Condemns War"). ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' had a regular sketch, "[[Saturday Night Live TV show sketches of the 2000s#Jarret's Room|Jarret's Room]]", starring [[Jimmy Fallon]], which purports to take place at Hampshire College but is inaccurate. It refers to non-existent buildings ("McGuinn Hall", which is actually the Sociology and Social Work building at fellow cast member [[Amy Poehler]]'s alma mater, [[Boston College]]) and features yearbooks, tests, seniors, fraternities, three-person dorm rooms, and a football team—none of which the school has ever had (though in the Fall 2005, 2006, and 2007 semesters the college experienced a higher than expected number of freshmen and temporarily had to convert some common spaces into three-person dorms). The sketch also claims that the college is actually in [[New Hampshire]] (a common mistake).

Alumnus [[Ken Burns]] wrote of the college: "Hampshire College is a perfect American place. If we look back at the history of our country, the things we celebrate were outside of the mainstream. Much of the world operated under a tyrannical model, but Americans said, 'We will govern ourselves.' So, too, Hampshire asked, at its founding, the difficult questions of how we might educate ourselves... When I entered Hampshire, I found it to be the most exciting place on earth." [[Loren Pope]] wrote of Hampshire in the college guide ''[[Colleges That Change Lives]]'': "Today no college has students whose intellectual thyroids are more active or whose minds are more compassionately engaged."

===Flag removal===
Following the [[United States presidential election, 2016|election]] of [[Donald Trump]] as [[President of the United States]], on November 9, 2016, Hampshire students lowered the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] at the center of campus to [[half-staff]] as "a protest against acts of hate and harassment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoover|first1=Amanda|title=Why Hampshire College pulled down the American Flag|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2016/1128/Why-Hampshire-College-pulled-down-the-American-Flag|work=Christian Science Monitor|date=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, school officials announced they would allow the flag to remain at half-staff temporarily. College president Jonathan Lash said in a statement that some of the people on campus felt that the flag was "a powerful symbol of fear they've felt all their lives because they grew up in marginalized communities, never feeling safe." In an incident under investigation by campus police, the [[flag desecration|flag was burned]] at some time in the evening of November 10 or the morning of November 11. It was replaced the following day and the school indicated it would continue to fly the flag at half-mast "to mourn deaths from violence in the U.S. and around the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bromwich|first1=Jonah Engel|title=Hampshire College Draws Protests Over Removal of U.S. Flag|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/us/hampshire-college-flag-veterans-protest.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a backlash, the college announced on November 21 that it would temporarily cease flying the flag on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/11/21/massachusetts-college-stops-flying-american-flag-after-it-becomes-focus-of-dispute-over-trump/|title=Massachusetts college stops flying American flag after it becomes focus of dispute over Trump|work=Washington Post|date=November 21, 2016|first=Susan |last=Svrluga|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/hampshirecollege/posts/10154927092331159|title=A Statement from President Lash: "Some... - Hampshire College {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, led to protests including veterans for restoration of the flag, with sources claiming from 400 attendees to “over a thousand.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwlp.com/2016/11/27/veterans-protest-flag-removal-at-hampshire-college/|title=Veterans protest flag removal at Hampshire College|first=Ashley|last=Afonso|date=November 27, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/us/hampshire-college-flag-veterans-protest.amp.html&lt;/ref&gt; Local state representative [[John Velis]] (D) called for the school to return the flag and expel the students who burned the flag: they should "pack up their bags and leave."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwlp.com/2016/11/14/rep-john-velis-says-flag-burners-should-pack-up-their-bags-and-leave/|title=Rep.

The '''Higher Learning Commission''' ('''HLC''') is an organization tasked with the regional [[Higher education accreditation in the United States|accreditation responsibilities for post-secondary education institutions in the central United States]]. The Higher Learning Commission oversees the [[educational accreditation|accreditation]] of [[Academic degree|degree]]-granting [[college]]s and [[Universities in the United States|universities]] in nineteen mostly [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[South Central United States|South-Central]] states, namely [[Arkansas]], [[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[Iowa]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Kansas]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[North Dakota]], [[Nebraska]], [[Ohio]], [[Oklahoma]], [[New Mexico]], [[South Dakota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Wyoming]]. The headquarters of the organization is based in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].

The [[United States Department of Education]] and the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] recognize the Commission as the assigned [[regional accreditation|regional accrediting]] organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg7.html | title=College Accreditation in the United States: Regional and National Institutional Accrediting Agencies | publisher=United States Department of Education |accessdate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Regional Accrediting Organizations 2009-2010 |url=http://www.chea.org/Directories/regional.asp |publisher=Council for Higher Education Accreditation |accessdate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831092348/http://www.chea.org/Directories/regional.asp |archivedate=2009-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; HLC grew out of the higher education division of the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA).  The NCA dissolved in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hlcommission.org/About-the-Commission/about-hlc.html |title=About the Higher Learning Commission |publisher=Higher Learning Commission |date=2015 |accessdate=December 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria for Accreditation==
The Higher Learning Commission has five major criteria for accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;http://download.hlcommission.org/CriteriaRevision_2018_INF.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They are:
(1) Mission,
(2) Ethics,
(3) Teaching and Learning: Quality, Resources, and Support,
(4) Teaching and Learning: Evaluation and Improvement,
and (5) Resources, Planning, and Institutional Effectiveness.

==Criticism==
In 2009, the Office of the Inspector General of the [[US Department of Education]] (OIG-ED) criticized the Higher Learning Commission's oversight of [[for-profit colleges]] and recommended that the agency consider "limiting, suspending, or terminating the organization's status."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chronicle.com/article/Inspector-Generals-Warning-to/63206&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the OIG reaffirmed their recommendation that the department consider sanctions for the HLC.  It also critically reviewed the accreditation status of [[American InterContinental University]] and the [[Art Institute of Colorado]], two for-profit colleges.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chronicle.com/article/Inspector-General-Keeps-the/65691&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the OIG-ED issued a critical audit on the review process the HLC used while considering colleges’ proposals for competency-based credentials.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2015/10/05/us-inspector-general-criticizes-accreditor-over-competency-based-education&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project history==
[[File:Dan Savage Provided.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Dan Savage]] (2005)]]

The project was founded by Savage in response to the suicide of Billy Lucas and other teenagers who were bullied because they were [[gay]] or perceived to be, such as with [[Raymond Chase]], [[Suicide of Tyler Clementi|Tyler Clementi]], [[Suicide of Ryan Halligan|Ryan Halligan]], [[Asher Brown]], and [[Seth Walsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaytimes.co.uk/Magazine/InThisIssue-articleid-7574-sectionid-742.html |title=GT Investigates - In This Issue |publisher=GayTimes |date= |accessdate=2010-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114141911/http://www.gaytimes.co.uk/Magazine/InThisIssue-articleid-7574-sectionid-742.html |archivedate=2010-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/incoming/in-suicides-wake-a-message-to-gay-teens-hang-on-you-are-not-alone/1125546 |title=In suicide's wake, a message to gay teens: Hang on; you are not alone |publisher=St. Petersburg Times; Tampabay.com |date=2 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Savage wrote, "I wish I could have talked to this kid for five minutes. I wish I could have told Billy that ''it gets better''. I wish I could have told him that, however bad things were, however isolated and alone he was, ''it gets better''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=4940874 |title=Give 'Em Hope |last=Savage |first=Dan |authorlink=Dan Savage |date=September 23, 2010 |publisher=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, they launched their YouTube channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/itgetsbetterproject/about|title=It Gets Better Project - YouTube|work=[[YouTube]]|date= |accessdate=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A one-hour special aired on February 21, 2012, hosted by Savage.

Former U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] lent his voice to the movement against bullying and contributed a video on October 21, 2010, saying, "We've got to dispel this myth that bullying is just a normal rite of passage; that it's just some inevitable part of growing up. It's not. We have an obligation to ensure that our schools are safe for all of our kids. And for every young person out there you need to know that if you're in trouble, there are caring adults who can help."&lt;ref name=Obama /&gt; In March 2011, Barack Obama and First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] hosted an anti-bullying conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/us/politics/11obama.html|title=Obamas Focus on Antibullying Efforts|date=11 March 2011|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A viral [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/nov/16/wake-it-gets-better-campaign response] to the campaign posits that for some, "It Doesn't Get Better."

==Countries adopting similar projects==

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the organisation It Gets Better Australia&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120918023257/http://www.itgetsbetter.org.au/ It Gets Better Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; was established as the official Australian affiliate to the US based It Gets Better Project in 2011. It is supported by well-known members of the community including Ministers [[Kevin Rudd]] and [[Anna Bligh]] who have made their own [[YouTube]] videos. Rudd is quoted as saying "You have the strength of the Australian nation behind you", encouraging teenagers to feel comfortable in their own identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6ng1-0Paes | title=Kevin Rudd "It Gets Better" | date=November 3, 2010 | accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Australian figures to have supported the regional project include [[Triple J]], [[Telstra]], [[Optus]], [[Missy Higgins]], [[Courtney Act]] and [[Kerryn Phelps]].

===Canada===
One organization, It Gets Better Canada, created a 12-minute video which featured a number of Canadian LGBT public figures, including [[Deb Pearce]], [[Rick Mercer]], [[Rex Harrington]], [[Ann-Marie MacDonald]], [[Enza Anderson]], [[Diane Flacks]], [[Brad Fraser]], [[Mark Tewksbury]], [[George Smitherman]], [[Peter Fallico]], [[Laurie Lynd]] and the cast of ''[[1 Girl 5 Gays]]'', talking about their own experiences of [[coming out]] in a [[documentary]] interview format. In addition to [[the Trevor Project]], this video also endorsed two similar Canadian services, [[Kids Help Phone]] and Toronto's [[Lesbian Gay Bi Trans Youth Line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p-AT18d9lU | title=It Gets Better Canada | date=November 2, 2010 | accessdate=November 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar video was subsequently released by a group of [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] employees, including national network figures such as [[Jian Ghomeshi]], [[Sook-Yin Lee]], [[W. Brett Wilson]] and [[Brent Bambury]] as well as numerous other staffers and freelancers, speaking about their experiences of bullying on a variety of issues, including sexuality, race and disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2drknoSjdU | title=It Gets Better from the folks at the CBC |date=November 15, 2010 |accessdate=November 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former politicians [[Michael Ignatieff]] and [[Jack Layton]] also released videos when they were in office.

Following the 2011 suicide of Ottawa teenager [[Allan Hubley|Jamie Hubley]], an It Gets Better-themed video dedicated to Hubley, filmed on [[Parliament Hill]] and featuring commentary by Parliament staffers, [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] members of parliament including [[John Baird (Canadian politician)|John Baird]], [[Vic Toews]], [[Lois Brown]], [[Alice Wong]], [[Mike Wallace (politician)|Mike Wallace]], [[Rona Ambrose]], [[Shelly Glover]], [[Deepak Obhrai]], [[Candice Hoeppner]] and [[David Sweet]] and Conservative Senator [[Don Meredith (politician)|Don Meredith]] was posted to YouTube on October 20, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV1i8LWb9hY|title = It Gets Better - In Memory of Jamie Hubley|date = October 20, 2011|accessdate = October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former law clerk for the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]] Josh D. Scheinert noted on ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' that many of the participant legislators in the video had voted against the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2005 and that a few had ties to anti-gay organizations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2011/10/21/conservative-elected-officials-release-it-gets-better-video|title = Conservatives' "It Gets Better" Video: Hypocrisy or Opportunity?|author = Josh D. Scheinert|publisher = The Huffington Post|date = October 24, 2011 &lt;!--12:05 AM ET--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he concurred with [[Dan Savage]]'s opinion that the video was a first, but not final, step for the Conservative Party towards better relations with LGBT citizens in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2011/10/21/conservative-elected-officials-release-it-gets-better-video |title = Conservative Elected Officials Release "It Gets Better" Video|publisher = The Stranger|date = October 21, 2011 &lt;!-- at 9:28 AM --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, comedian [[Rick Mercer]] — who had previously made an earlier, more lighthearted "It Gets Better" video&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2010/11/02/rick-mercer-gets-better-112.html |title=CBC News - Nfld. &amp; Labrador - Rick Mercer joins It Gets Better campaign |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2010-11-02 |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; — devoted a weekly "rant" on ''[[Rick Mercer Report]]'' to an updated comment on the subject, making an impassioned plea for LGBT public figures to come out on the grounds that Hubley's death had made it unacceptable to stay silent anymore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/canada/breakingnews/rick-mercers-television-rant-against-the-bullying-of-gay-teens-goes-viral---132755873.html "Rick Mercer's television rant against the bullying of gay teens goes viral"].

''[[Toronto Star]]'', October 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a group video was also released by twenty [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] officers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/bc-gay-lesbian-mounties-release-it-gets-better-video/article4959193/ "B.C. gay, lesbian Mounties release ‘It Gets Better’ video"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', November 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
The project ''Todo Mejora'' ("Everything Gets Better") was launched on March 20, 2012 in [[Chile]]. In August 2011 the activist Júlio Cezar Dantas raised the idea of creating a Spanish version of the original site along with the U.S. coordinators of It Gets Better. They identified and contacted the Chilean organization [[Fundación Iguales]] ("Equal Foundation") to support the initiative. The organization agreed to work, and make an alliance, with ''Proyecto Todo Mejora'' ("Everything Gets Better Project"). The Chilean project also aims to support, together with the coordinators of It Gets Better U.S., other countries in Latin America who want to create a ''Todo Mejora'' project in their nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todomejora.org/index.php/ ''Todo Mejora''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323020200/http://todomejora.org/index.php |date=2012-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, the organizers of the festival [[Seksualiti Merdeka]] produced a series of videos within the vein of the It Gets Better Project featuring bloggers such as [[Azwan Ismail]], [[Pang Khee Teik]], Gary Ooi, Jerome Kugan, Joe Pang, Kavidha Natarajan, Michelle Nor Ismat, Nabila Nasir, Nisha, Peter Ong, Seetha, Sharaad Kuttan, Sulastri and Tina Fazlita Fadzil. Alvin Ng. Ismail's video, which was addressed directly to gay Muslims in the country, resulted in anonymous death threats being issued against him. The videos were inspired by an interview of Gabrielle Yong, a 21-year-old Malaysian openly bisexual student who attempted suicide while studying abroad in Massachusetts; while her attempt was due to the difficulty of adjustment in a different environment, she was inspired to contribute her own testimony in the vein of the project.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole paragraph|date=December 2012}}

A '''Junior school''' is a type of [[school]] which provides [[primary education]] to children, often in the age range from 8 and 13, following attendance at [[Infant school]] which covers the age range 5–7. (As both Infant and Junior schools are giving [[Primary Education]] pupils are commonly placed in a unified building housing the age ranges of both Infants and Juniors – a [[Primary school]]).

==Australia==
In [[Australia]], a '''junior school''' is usually a part of a [[Private School|private school]] that educates children between the ages of 2 and 5. 

In South Australia a junior primary school, it is where a child will begin their education, usually in or before the year level preceding Year 1. Depending on the school, a child will move to the main primary school between the ages of 3 in 8

In most primary schools, the junior primary is located within the same buildings and grounds as the primary school, although some junior schools are located on an adjacent or separate site.

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] a junior school is usually a small school serving a particular locality, and is also used by [[independent school]]s to refer to the nursery and [[primary school]] services they offer. 

A junior school forms part of the local pattern of provision for [[primary education]]. Most junior schools cater for pupils moving from [[infant school]]s from the September following their seventh birthday. Pupils join in Year 3, and stay at the school for four years, leaving at the end of Year 6 when most pupils are aged 11. These four years form [[Key Stage 2]] in the [[Education in England|English education system]]. At the end of this time, most pupils will move to a [[secondary school]]. 

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a significant number of junior schools were abolished in favour of 2–5 middle schools, and while some of these remain open today the majority of them have been abolished in favour of a return to traditional 7–11 junior schools.

In some [[London borough]]s, a JMI is a "junior mixed infant school" which caters to children aged 4 to 11. Some have been renamed to the more common "primary school".

'''Laura Mackenzie Phillips''' (born November 10, 1959) is an American [[actress]] and [[singing|singer]] best known for her roles in ''[[American Graffiti]]'', as rebellious teenager Julie Mora Cooper Horvath on the sitcom ''[[One Day at a Time]]'', and for the [[Disney Channel]] [[science fiction]] show ''[[So Weird]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/534879/Mackenzie-Phillips| title=The New York Times| newspaper=The New York Times}}{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Born in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], she is the daughter of [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]], singer in [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]], and his first wife, Susan Adams. She is the sister of Jeffrey Phillips and a half-sister of Tamerlane Phillips, actress [[Bijou Phillips]], and singer [[Chynna Phillips]].

Phillips attended [[Highland Hall Waldorf School]] in Northridge, California.&lt;ref name=memoir&gt;{{cite book |first=Mackenzie |last=Phillips |title=High on Arrival |publisher=Simon Spotlight Entertainment |place=New York |date=September 23, 2009 |isbn=978-1-4391-5757-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBOSVciLcEsC&amp;dq=high+on+arrival&amp;q=highland+hall#v=snippet&amp;q=highland%20hall&amp;f=false |pages=14-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 12, Phillips formed a band with three of her classmates and was spotted by a casting agent during one of their performances.&lt;ref name=biography.com&gt;{{cite web |title=Mackenzie Phillips Biography (1959-) |publisher=[[The Biography Channel]] |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9542290 |accessdate=November 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was given an audition for a role in the 1973 hit film ''[[American Graffiti]]'', which she won.

== Career ==
Phillips was 12 years old during the filming of ''[[American Graffiti]]'', and 13 when the movie was released. She was cast as Carol Morrison, a young girl accidentally picked up by [[hot rod]]ding teenager John Milner ([[Paul Le Mat]]). Because of California state law, producer [[Gary Kurtz]] became Phillips' [[legal guardian]] for the duration of the filming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Baxter| first=John| title=Mythmaker: The Life and Work of George Lucas| publisher=Harper Collins| year=1999| isbn=978-0-3809-7833-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:One Day at a Time female cast 1975.jpg|160px|thumb|left|Mackenzie Phillips in 1975. She is seen here alongside fellow cast members [[Bonnie Franklin]] and [[Valerie Bertinelli]]]]
Phillips gained stardom in the 1970s, when she played boy-crazy teenager Julie Cooper (when the character got married, her married name was Horvath) on the long-running television show ''[[One Day at a Time]]'', for which she earned $50,000 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1975}}}} today) a week.&lt;ref name=biography.com/&gt; During the show's third season in 1977, Phillips was arrested for [[Disorderly conduct#United States|disorderly conduct]]. Because of her drug and alcohol abuse, Phillips began arriving late and was even incoherent for rehearsals. The producers ordered her to take a six-week break to overcome her addiction but were ultimately forced to fire her in 1980.&lt;ref name=biography.com/&gt;

After two near-fatal [[Drug overdose|overdoses]], Phillips voluntarily entered Fair Oaks Hospital to undergo treatment. After she completed treatment in 1981, the producers of ''One Day at a Time'' invited her back to the show.&lt;ref name=biography.com/&gt; However, in 1982, Phillips resumed her [[cocaine]] use and the following year, she collapsed on the show's set. When she refused to take a drug test, she was fired again, this time for good. Her character was written out of the series. In 1992, she entered a long-term drug rehabilitation program and underwent intensive treatment for nine months.&lt;ref name=biography.com/&gt;

From the mid 1980s to the early 1990s, Phillips performed with a re-formed version of The Mamas &amp; the Papas, known as [[The New Mamas and The Papas]].

In 1999, Phillips co-starred with [[Cara DeLizia]] in the Disney Channel series ''[[So Weird]]'', playing a fictional rock star named Molly Phillips. She sang original songs written by show producers [[Jon Cooksey]] and Ann Marie Montade. In 2002, she appeared in the Disney Channel original movie ''[[Double Teamed]]''. Phillips guest-starred on episodes of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', ''[[Without a Trace]]'', ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'', and ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]''.

Phillips won an Honorary Best Actress award on March 20, 2011, at the closing night awards gala of the Female Eye Film Festival in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, for her performance as Sharon in the 2010 independent film ''Peach Plum Pear''. While in Toronto, she was interviewed on ''Canada Am'', ''ET Canada'', and ''[[Marilyn Denis|The Marilyn Denis Show]] ''.&lt;ref name="wire service canada"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.wireservice.ca/index.php?module=News&amp;func=display&amp;sid=4844 |title=9th Female Eye Festival Reveals Mackenzie Phillips &amp; Alanna Masterson As Special Performance Award Recipients |publisher=Female Eye Film Festival |via=Skylar Entertainment |date=March 10, 2011 |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She currently works at the Breathe Life Healing Center in [[West Hollywood, California]], as a drug rehab counselor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.cbs8.com/story/31467518/mackenzie-phillips-joins-breathe-life-healing-centers-as-addiction-counselort| title=Mackenzie Phillips Joins Breathe as Addiction Counselor| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315141137/http://www.cbs8.com/story/31467518/mackenzie-phillips-joins-breathe-life-healing-centers-as-addiction-counselort| date=March 15, 2016| work=[[KFMB-TV]] News| archive-date=March 15, 2016| accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Phillips appeared in an episode of the rebooted ''[[One Day at a Time (2017 TV series)|One Day at a Time]]'', featured as Pam Valentine.  The role was apt, given Phillips' history: she portrayed a counselor. 
[[File:Mackenzie Phillips.jpg|160px|thumb|right|Phillips in 2008]]
In 2018, Phillips appeared as Barbara Denning in multiple episodes of Netflix original ''Orange is the New Black''.

==Personal life==
Phillips has been married three times: first to rock group manager Jeffrey Sessler, son of [[Freddie Sessler]] (from 1979 to 1981); then to rock guitarist [[Michael Barakan]] – now known professionally as [[Shane Fontayne]] (1986-2000). She has one child, son Shane Barakan (born 1987), a musician.  Her third marriage was in June 2005 to Keith Levenson.

===Substance abuse and arrest===
Phillips has had a lifetime troubled by drug abuse. On August 27, 2008, she was arrested by the [[Los Angeles Airport Police]] on charges of possession of [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]] after she went through airport security screening.&lt;ref name="ap-arrest"&gt;{{cite news| title=Mackenzie Phillips arrested at LAX on suspicion of narcotics possession| agency=[[Reuters]]| date=August 28, 2008| url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/mackenzie-phillips-arrested-at-lax-on-suspicion-of-narcotics-possession/| accessdate=2018-09-20| newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 31, 2008, she pleaded guilty to one felony count of cocaine possession, and was sentenced to a drug rehabilitation program.&lt;ref name="guilty"&gt;{{cite news| title=Mackenzie Phillips Pleads Guilty to Cocaine Possession| magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]| date=October 31, 2008| url=https://people.com/crime/mackenzie-phillips-pleads-guilty-to-cocaine-possession/| accessdate=2018-09-20| first=Ken| last=Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips' drug case was dismissed after she successfully completed a drug diversion program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2010-04-30-mackenzie-phillips-charge_N.htm| title=Drug case dismissed against Mackenzie Phillips| newspaper=[[USA Today]]| date=April 20, 2010| agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She appeared on the third season of ''[[Celebrity Rehab#Cast 3|Celebrity Rehab]]'', which aired in January and February 2010. She later discussed her recovery on the March 17, 2010, episode of ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-view/episode-14313875/192276/ Episode guide: ''The View'', first aired: March 17, 2010], ''[[TV Guide]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with father===
In September 2009, Phillips's memoir ''High on Arrival'' was released, after which she appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' for an hour-long interview. She told Winfrey that she first tried cocaine when she was 11 years old, and that her father had taken drugs with her, and had also injected her with [[cocaine]].

During the interview, Phillips read excerpts from her book. She said that at the age of 19, on the night before her first wedding, "I woke up that night from a blackout to find myself having sex with my own father", and that when she confronted her father months later,&lt;ref&gt;''High On Arrival'' p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; asking why he had raped her, her father simply replied, "Raped you? Don't you mean we made love?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/mackenzie-phillips-sexual-affair-dad/story?id=8647172 ABC News9/23/09]&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillips told [[Oprah Winfrey]] of having a [[consent|consensual]] sexual relationship with her father,&lt;ref name="bombshell"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/09/24/earlyshow/leisure/celebspot/main5335218.shtml| title=New Bombshell from Mackenzie Phillips| date=2009-09-24| website=[[CBS News]]| accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing her participation as "sort of [[Stockholm Syndrome]], where you begin to love your captor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6847215.ece |title=Mackenzie Phillips, daughter of Mamas and Papas star, reveals their incestuous affair |last=Schmidt |first=Veronica |date=2009-09-24|newspaper=[[The Times]] |accessdate=2009-09-25 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genevieve Waite|Geneviève Waïte]], who was John's wife at the time MacKenzie claimed the incest first began, denies the allegations, saying they were inconsistent with his character. [[Michelle Phillips]], John's second wife, also stated that she had "every reason to believe [Mackenzie's account is] untrue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Eng |first=Joyce |title=Mackenzie Phillips' Family Split Over Star's Incest Claims |magazine=[[TV Guide]] |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/mackenzie-phillips-family-1010113/ |accessdate=2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Chynna Phillips]], Mackenzie's half-sister and Michelle Phillips' daughter, stated that she believed Mackenzie's claims and that Mackenzie first told her about the relationship during a phone conversation in 1997, approximately 11 years after the supposed relationship had ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Everett |first=Cristina |title=Chynna Phillips recalls learning about sister Mackenzie Phillips' affair with father, John Phillips |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2009/09/23/2009-09-23_chynna_phillips_recalls_learning_about_sister_mackenzie_phillips_affair_with_fat.html |accessdate=2009-09-24 |date=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3161">'''Maths Pathway''' is an [[Educational technology|online educational]] [[website]] based in [[Melbourne]], used in Australian [[school]]s to teach [[mathematics]]. It differs from [[traditional mathematics]] teaching, as it is set up in a [[Modularity|modular]] format, with students working on individual pieces of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mathspathway.com|title=Home – Maths Pathway|website=www.mathspathway.com|date=2017|language=en|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://teachforaustralia.org/2016/04/25/impact-case-study-maths-pathway/ |title=Impact Case Study: Maths Pathway |last= |first= |date=25 April 2016 |website=Teach For Australia |publisher= |access-date= 18 September 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Maths Pathway was created in 2015 by Richard Wilson and Justin Matthys, both teachers that had experienced their nation's decline in mathematics rankings and were concerned about [[automation]] leading to jobs requiring higher mathematical skill. It started out as a small website headquartered in a shed in Matthys' lawn, but has grown to be featured in over 170+ schools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/australian-teachers-devise-better-pathway-to-maths-learning/news-story/2096bc39df60bfdf08f3cf4fdc23a231 |title= Australian teachers devise better pathway to maths learning |last=Burrell |first=Andrew |date=10 August 2016 |website=[[The Australian]] |publisher=NewsCorp Australia |access-date=18 September 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used by 12,000+ students.&lt;ref name="Pangaea"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pangaeaimpact.com/single-post/2016/12/06/Pangaea-Impact-invests-in-Maths-Pathway |title=Pangaea invests in Maths Pathway|last=Bohm |first=Anthony |date=6 December 2016 |website=Pangaea Impact Assessments |publisher= |access-date= 18 September 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson and Matthys hope to have most Australian schools use it eventually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/nab-meet-the-changemakers/2016/jan/12/new-teaching-model-gets-better-results-from-students |title=New teaching model gets better results from students|last= |first= |date=12 January 2016 |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media Ltd. |access-date= 18 September 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
Math Pathway uses a modular format where students select their work based on what proficiency level they are at, as opposed to every student completing the same tasks. Students are then required to be [[Test (assessment)|tested]] on what they have learned every [[fortnight]]. To use Maths Pathway, schools must pay a fee for each student.&lt;ref name="Pangaea" /&gt;

== Biography==

McKinley Blackburn earned a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in economics from the [[University of South Carolina]] in 1982, followed by a [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and a [[Ph.D.]] in economics from [[Harvard University]] in 1985 and 1987. Since his graduation, Blackburn has always held a position at the University of South Carolina, first as assistant professor pf economics (1987–93), then as associate professor (1993–98) and finally as full professor (1998-2010). In 2010, he was made the James A. Morris Professor of Economics at the [[Darla Moore School of Business]]. In 1989/90, Blackburn spent a year as visiting scholar at the [[Russell Sage Foundation]]. In terms of professional service, Blackburn has performed editorial duties for the ''[[Economics of Education Review]]'' since 2008. His research has been recognized with the Aldi J.M. Hagenaars Memorial Award (1994) and the Research Development Award of the Darla Moore School of Business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/moore/documents/economics/blackburn_cv_january_2018.pdf Curriculum vitae of McKinley Blackburn from the website of the University of South Carolina.

== Research==

McKinley Blackburn's current research focuses on the effects of [[minimum wage]]s on [[employment]], the econometric estimation of the effect of individual characteristics on [[wage]]s, and the behaviour of banks in mortgage markets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/moore/directory/blackburn_mckinley.php Profile of McKinley Blackburn on the website of the University of South Carolina.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[IDEAS/RePEc]], Blackburn belongs to the top 6% of economists registered in the database in terms of research output.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html Ranking of economists registered on IDEAS/RePEc. Retrieved March 22nd, 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; Key findings of his research include the following:
* The increases in the [[Mincerian equations|returns to schooling]] observed in the [[United States|U.S.]] during the 1980s cannot be attributed to a change in the relationship between ability and schooling wherein higher returns to schooling would have e.g. masked an increase in the average ability of graduates (with [[David Neumark]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jlabec/v11y1993i3p521-44.html Blackburn, M., Neumark, D. (1993). Omitted-Ability Bias and the Increase in the Return to Schooling. ''Journal of Labor Economics'', 11(3), pp. 521-544.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Together with [[David E. Bloom]] and [[Richard B. Freeman]], Blackburn documents the strong deterioration of the economic position of less-skilled American males in the 1970s and 1980s, which the authors attribute to a combination of [[deindustrialization]], [[deunionization]], and changes in the growth rates of different education groups, but find no role for decreases in the minimum wage, technological change, increased female labour market participation, and changes in the quality of less-educated workers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/3186.html Blackburn, M.L., Bloom, D.E., Freeman, R.B. (1989). The Declining Economic Position of Less-Skilled American Males. ''NBER Working Paper Series'', 3186.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Contrary the downward bias in the [[Ordinary least squares|OLS]] estimates of the returns to schooling in the U.S. found in earlier research, Blackburn and Neumark find that OLS estimates which fail to control for ability overestimate returns to schooling by 40%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/restat/v77y1995i2p217-30.html Blackburn, M.L., Neumark, D. (1995). Are OLS Estimates of the Return to Schooling Biased Downward? Another Look. ''Review of Economics and Statistics'', 77(2), pp. 217-230.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Differences in unobserved ability appear to explain only a small share of wage differentials between industries and occupations in the U.S. (with Neumark).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/qjecon/v107y1992i4p1421-1436..html Blackburn, M., Neumark, D. (1992). Unobserved Ability, Efficiency Wages, and Interindustry Differentials. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 107(4), pp. 1421-1436.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increases in [[minimum wage]]s in the U.S. between 1983 and 1996 appear to have reduced poverty among teenagers and older dropouts from [[junior high school]]s (with [[John T. Addison]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/sae/ilrrev/v52y1999i3p393-409.html Addison, J.T., Blackburn, M. L. (1999). Minimum Wages and Poverty. ''ILR Review'', 52(3), pp. 393-409.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Unemployment insurance]] may have increased the wages of workers in the U.S. after the end of their unemployment spells, though less than indicated by earlier research.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/labeco/v7y2000i1p21-53.html Addison, J.T., Blackburn, M.L. (2000). The effects of unemployment insurance on postunemployment earnings. ''Labour economics'', 7(1), pp. 21-53.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3039">'''The Nature Exchange''' is a specialized learning environment that encourages people to explore nature and actively observe, collect, study and share the world around them. It is a turn-key exhibit, now used in nature-based institutions around [[North America]]. Developed by [[Science North]] and [[AldrichPears Associates]], the Nature Exchange is an interactive forum where visitors trade ethically collected natural objects and information about them to learn and engage with the natural world. Visitors earn points for each trade, based on criteria such as quality, rarity and their knowledge of the item.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sciencenorth.ca/enterprises/work/exhibits/natureexchange/index.html Nature Exchange]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Science museum#Science_center|Science center]]s, nature centers and [[zoo]]s use Nature Exchanges to raise awareness of key issues in the natural world, and, through personal interaction, changes attitudes and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;S.

'''No promo homo laws''' are laws approved by various [[U.S. states]] that prohibit or limit the mention or discussion of [[homosexuality]] and [[transgender]] identity in [[State school|public schools]]. In theory, these laws mainly apply to [[sex ed]] courses, but they can also be applied to other parts of the school curriculum as well as to extracurricular activities and organizations such as [[gay-straight alliance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glsen.org/learn/policy/issues/nopromohomo|title=“No Promo Homo” Laws|website=GLSEN|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These anti-LGBT curriculum laws can be found in [[Alabama]], [[Arizona]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[Oklahoma]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/dont-erase-us/faq|title=#DontEraseUs:  FAQ About Anti-LGBT Curriculum Laws|publisher=|accessdate=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are similar to [[Section 28]] of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Local Government Act 1988]], introduced on May 24, 1988, which prohibits [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local authorities]] from "intentionally promoting homosexuality, publishing material with the intention of promoting homosexuality, or promoting the teaching in any [[State school|maintained school]] of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880009_en_5.htm Local Government Act 1988 (c. 9)], section 28. Accessed July 1, 2006 on opsi.gov.uk.&lt;/ref&gt; The law was repealed in Scotland in 2000, as one of the first actions of the devolved [[Scottish Parliament]], and in the rest of the United Kingdom in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Local Government Act 2003|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/26/section/122|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nocturnal house''', sometimes called a '''nocturama''',&lt;ref&gt;The Rotarian - Jan 1977 - Page 19 "Although ours is a private zoological organization, we still manage to operate an aquarium, a dolphinarium, a planetarium, a nocturama, a botanical garden, a museum of natural history, a public library, a natural reserve of some 100 hectares ..."&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[building]] in a [[zoo]] or research establishment where [[nocturnal animal]]s are kept and viewable by the public. The unique feature of buildings of this type is that the [[lighting]] within is isolated from the outside and reversed; i.e. it is dark during the [[day]] and lit at [[night]]. This is to enable visitors and researchers to more conveniently study nocturnal animals during daylight hours.

Internally, a building usually consists of several glass-walled enclosures containing a replica of the animals' normal environments. In the case of burrowing animals, often their tunnels are 'half-glassed' so the animals can be observed while underground.

'''''One Two Three... Infinity: Facts and Speculations of Science''''' is a popular science book by theoretical physicist [[George Gamow]], first published in 1947, exploring some fundamental concepts in mathematics and science, but written at a level understandable by [[middle school]] students up through "intelligent layman" adults.&lt;ref name=Gamow&gt;''One, Two, Three...Infinity'' (1947, revised 1961), Viking Press (copyright renewed by Barbara Gamow, 1974), reprinted by Dover Publications, {{ISBN|978-0-486-25664-1}}, illustrated by the author; eBook edition, Dover, 2012 {{ISBN|9781306350099}}; other editions and translations&lt;/ref&gt; The book is illustrated by Gamow.

==Overview==
Beginning with an exploration of elementary numbers, the book opens with a description of the "Hottentots" ([[Khoikhoi]]), said to have words only for "one", "two", "three", and "many", and builds quickly to explore [[Georg Cantor]]'s theory of three levels of [[infinity]]—hence the title of the book.  It then describes a simple automatic printing press that can in principle (given enough paper, ink, and time) print all the English works that have ever been, or ever will be, printed (a more-systematic version of the [[infinite monkey theorem]]).  The author notes that if all the atoms in the Universe, as known in Gamow's time, were such printing presses working in parallel "at the speed of atomic vibrations" since the [[Big Bang|beginning of known time]], only an infinitesimal fraction of the job could have yet been completed.&lt;ref name="Gamow" /&gt;

Gamow explores [[number theory]], [[topology]], [[spacetime]], [[theory of relativity|relativity]], [[chemistry|atomic chemistry]], [[nuclear physics]], [[entropy]], [[genetics]], and [[cosmology]].

==Reception==
Science writer [[Willy Ley]] praised Gamow's book, describing it as an "admittedly rare ... book which entertains by way of instruction."&lt;ref&gt;Willy Ley, "Book Review," ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', June 1948, pp.158-61.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kirkus Reviews]] declared it "a stimulating and provocative book for the science-minded layman".&lt;ref name=kirkus&gt;{{cite web|title=One Two Three...Infinity by George Gamow|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/george-gamow-2/one-two-threeinfinity/|publisher=Kirkus Reviews|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical physicist [[Sean M. Carroll]] credited ''One Two Three... Infinity'' with setting the trajectory of his professional life.&lt;ref name=carroll&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean M.|authorlink1=Sean M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4609">'''''Pedagogy of Hope: Reliving Pedagogy of the Oppressed''''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]'': Pedagogia da Esperança: Um reencontro com a Pedagogia do Oprimido'') is a 1992 book written by [[Paulo Freire]] that contains his reflections and elaborations on his previous book ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'', with a focus on hope. It was first published in Portuguese in 1992 and was translated into English in 1994 by Robert Barr, with notes from Freire's widow Ana Maria Araújo Freire.

== Summary ==
''Pedagogy of Hope'' is broken up into seven chapters, along with an "Opening Words" section and an "Afterwards". In the book, Freire offers his reflections on the thinking behind ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed''. Unlike in his previous book, Freire centralizes the theme of hope and introduces it as an "[[Ontology|ontological]] need".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pedagogy of Hope: Reliving Pedagogy of the Oppressed|last=Freire|first=Paolo|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4725-3340-1|location=Great Britain|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that although hope alone is not enough to achieve liberation, without hope there is no struggle at all. Freire emphasizes the importance of the relationship between educators and students and continues to fight against the [[banking model of education]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pedagogy of Hope: Reliving Pedagogy of the Oppressed|last=Freire|first=Paolo|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4725-3340-1|location=Great Britain|pages=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "Afterwards", Ana Maria Araújo Freire reflects on her husband's work, and concludes by introducing the triangle of her reading of the world: "prohibition, liberation, and hope".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mary Ellen|first=Sullivan|date=Fall 1994|title=Pedagogy of Hope: Reliving Pedagogy of the Oppressed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical reception ==
Scholar Timothy D. Ireland argues that Freire does not offer anything new in ''Pedagogy of Hope''; rather, he argues, the merit of the book is Freire's willingness to expound and clarify his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ireland|first=Timothy D.|date=1994|title=Pedagogy of Hope (Book Review).|url=|journal=Convergence|volume=27|issue=2-3|pages=198|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denis Collins offers a similar view, noting that he could not identify new concerns or theories put forward by Freire.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Denis E.|date=1998|title=Review Essay: From Oppression to Hope: Freire's Journey Toward Utopia|url=|journal=Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|volume=29|pages=115–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Ellen Sullivan asserts that Freire has an almost [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] style of writing, making the translation "awkward [and] literal".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Conversely, Sarah Hendriks argues that "Freire's dialogical method of writing, as if he were letting us read the very pages of his personal diary, captivates his audience and thus his message becomes personally applicable to our own lives and practice of education".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fcis.oise.utoronto.ca/~daniel_sc/freire/sh.html|title=Pedagogy of Hope: Reliving Pedagogy of the Oppressed. (Review)|last=Hendriks|first=Sarah|date=|website=Reviews of Paolo Freire's Books|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hendriks also critiques Freire's concept of "unity in diversity", noting that it is overly focused on class struggle and does not acknowledge how people can be victims of multiple forms of oppression at the same time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sullivan also asserts that Freire is: "Uncompromisingly on the side of oppressed peoples everywhere, Freire promotes his philosophically dense ideas with the fervor of a revolutionary.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, Collins makes a point to acknowledge that Freire "makes profound apologies for apparent sexism in his earlier writings".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Shelli B. Fowler contends that Freire promoted teaching as acts of creativity--acts that should always be critical and never be mechanical. She also asserts that one of Freire's most fundamental points was that teachers need to teach students how to teach themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fowler|first=Shelli B.|date=1998|title=“Under the Shade of this Mango Tree”: Reflections on a Pedagogical Practice that Crosses Disciplinary Boundaries|url=|journal=Quest|volume=50|issue=3|pages=319-323|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Malaysia]], '''Pendidikan Moral''' ([[Malay language|Malay]] for "Moral Studies") is one of the core subjects in the [[Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia]] (SPM) examination. It is a required subject for all non-Muslim students in the [[Education in Malaysia|public education system in Malaysia]]. Muslim students are required to take the Islamic Studies ({{lang-ms|Pendidikan Islam}}) course. Pendidikan Moral, along with Islamic Studies, is governed by the Department of Islamic and Moral Studies (JAPIM), a branch under the [[Ministry of Higher Education (Malaysia)|Ministry of Higher Education]].

==Syllabus==
The core of the syllabus is the 36 [[moral value]]s (called "nilai" in Malay). These values include "''Kepercayaan kepada Tuhan''" (creed), "''Bertanggungjawab''" (responsibility) and "''Sikap Keterbukaan''" (open-mindedness) among others. The 36 values are divided categorized into 7 major fields of study (called "bidang" in Malay), namely: 

* ''Perkembangan Diri'' ([[self-help|self-development]]) 
* ''Kekeluargaan'' ([[family]]) 
* ''Alam Sekitar'' ([[nature]]) 
* ''Patriotisme'' ([[patriotism]]) 
* ''Hak Asasi Manusia'' ([[human rights]]) 
* ''Demokrasi'' ([[democracy]])  
* ''Keamanan dan Keharmonian'' ([[peace]] and harmony).

These values are presented in detail in textbooks and form the basis of corresponding examinations. Each value is defined by the Education Ministry. Answering examination questions requires some interpretation of these definitions.

Students are required to provide the exact same definitions of each moral value when answering exam questions. If a student misspelled or left out or word or rephrased the definition without changing its meaning, no marks will be given. Not fully memorizing the definitions is the reason why students always fail to secure an A+.

==Examination==
Pendidikan Moral is often learned by [[Rote learning|rote]]. Teachers in schools tend to concentrate on answering techniques rather than the teaching material provided in the textbook. Instead of interpreting the appropriate value based on the information given, students are taught to look for specific keywords in the description and identify the corresponding moral value. Thus, strict memorization of the values is required without any emphasis on understanding or application. There have been suggestions to reform the system and incorporate other forms of assessment and not rely completely on written examinations but thus far, they have not been implemented.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[http://myais.fsktm.um.edu.my/5116/1/10.pdf].

'''Sino-American Youth Ambassador (SAYA)''' ([[Simplified Chinese characters|Chinese Simplified]]: 中美青年大使; [[Pinyin]]: zhōngměi qīngnián dàshǐ) is an [[Student exchange program|exchange program]] run by the [[Ameson Education and Cultural Exchange Foundation]] seeking to build capacity for campus internationalization and cultural awareness in school campuses. Currently, SAYA program is open to Chinese and American students who serve as cultural ambassadors in both countries.

==Background==

The Sino-American Youth Ambassadors (SAYA) program started in 2010 as part of the [[Ameson Education and Cultural Exchange Foundation|Ameson Foundation]]'s program with the intention of bringing greater international awareness and cultural diversity in campus with American and Chinese high school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ameson.org/programs/capacity-building/saya |title=SAYA Program page |website=ameson.org|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAYA program seeks to build capacity for international education and provide new perspectives on education by exchanging student ambassadors. Each year, SAYA organizes two exchanges: one is American students go abroad in China and the other is Chinese students go abroad in United States. In 2012, approximately 20 American students participated the SAYA program in Beijing No. 4 High School where they learned Chinese language and cultural with SAYA Chinese students and travelled with their Chinese peers. In the return exchange in 2012, SAYA students had an opportunity to meet the U.S. Vice President, [[Joe Biden]] and the Chinese current [[paramount leader]], [[Xi Jinping]] during the exchange program in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ameson.org/foundation-news/1376-joe-biden-and-xi-jinping-meet-with-ameson-saya-students-joe-biden-and-xi-jinping-meet-with-ameson-saya-students |title= Joe Biden and Xi Jinping meet with Ameson SAYA Students|website=amesn.org|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, approximately 100 Chinese students participated the SAYA program during the Chinese New Year and introduced the Chinese New Year traditions to their American classmates in [[Belmont High School (Belmont, Wisconsin)|Belmont High School]], Thomas Jefferson High School, and [[Providence Day School]] and host families in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ameson.org/events/1453-saya-2013-saya-2013|title= Largest SAYA exchange to date concludes successfully|website=ameson.org|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return exchanges, students from Branson High School visited [[Shanghai]] Gezhi High School,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ameson.org/events/1454-changing-places-gezhi|title= Changing places: Branson students visit Shanghai Gezhi High School|website=ameson.org|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and students from [[Providence Day School]] visited Jingling High School’s Hexi campus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ameson.org/events/1500-saya-2013-hexi |title= Latest SAYA exchange comes to Hexi|website=ameson.org|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; later in the year 2013.

==Program==

SAYA programs take place during school holidays. Prior to the exchange, students undergo cultural training to learn about different cultures. During the exchange students immerse themselves in regular classes for a week and travel with their peers for another week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/us/2016-02/10/content_23442519.htm|last= Hua ShengDun|title=Students bring Chinese culture to US high schools|website=usa.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As cultural ambassadors, students share their culture with other students through [[presentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/local/madeira/2016/01/28/madeiraschools/79454692/|last= Sheila A.

SAYA connects American and Chinese high schools interested in cultural exchanges and arranges home-stays for participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.burnettcountysentinel.com/news/chinese-students-enjoy-grantsburg-visit/article_2ddb477e-d001-11e5-a52c-b3259c3fa815.html|last=Steve Briggs Sentinel|title=Chinese students enjoy Grantsburg visit|website=www.burnettcountysentinel.com|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAYA serves as an intermediary between American and Chinese students to facilitate cultural exchanges in personal level.

'''Stærðfræðikeppni Framhaldsskólanema''' is an annual mathematical olympiad first held in the winter of 1984–1985. It is hosted by the '''Íslenska Stærðfræðafélagið''' ({{lang-en|Icelandic Mathematical Organization}}) and the Natural Sciences's Teacher Association, and the largest competition of its kind in the country. Its goals include increasing the interest of Icelandic secondary school students towards mathematics, and other fields built on a mathematical foundation.

The contest is held in two parts every winter. First, a qualifier held in October of every year on two difficulty levels; upper level, and lower level. The lower level is intended for first year secondary school students, and the upper level for older students. Those who do well in the qualifier are invited to the final competition, held in March.

Alongside honours and awards, the top students are selected to perform in various mathematical olympiads, including the [[Baltic Way (mathematical contest)|Baltic Way]], the [[Nordic Mathematical Contest]], and the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Um keppnina|url=http://stae.is/stak/keppnin|website=stae.is|publisher=Stærðfræðifélag Íslands|accessdate=14 September 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170914202635/http://stae.is/stak/keppnin|archivedate=14 September 2017|location=Iceland|language=Icelandic|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Carol Duvall Show''''' is an arts and crafts show which aired on the [[HGTV]] cable channel from 1994 to 2005 hosted by [[Carol Duvall]]. It was also broadcast on the [[DIY Network]] from 2005 until late-2009.  Recordings of segments from the show can be viewed on their website.

The show is devoted to demonstrating and teaching a wide variety of crafts from very basic "cut and glue" projects to intricate polymer clay creations. Duvall's program was one of the original offerings on the newly founded Home &amp; Garden Television network in 1994, and it has remained one of the lifestyle network's most popular shows throughout its 12-year run. She introduced many polymer clay artists to the community including Judy Belcher, Maureen Carlson, Kim Cavender, Katherine Dewey, Emi Fukushima, Syndee Holt, Debbie Jackson, [[Donna Kato]], [[Barbara McGuire]], Ann Mitchell, Karen Mitchell, Becky Meverden, Lisa Pavelka, Gail Ritchey, Nan Roche, Michelle Ross, and Bob Wiley who have inspired countless polymer enthusiasts.

The show also featured interviews with crafters and fine artists - painters, sculptors, glass-blowers, etc. with footage of them at work in their studios.

The cancellation of the show on HGTV caused dismay among many of her fans;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Rec/rec.crafts.beads/2006-02/msg00130.html newsgroups.derkeiler.com]&lt;/ref&gt; whose protests might have influenced the decision to continue broadcasting it on the [[DIY Network]] (owned by the same parent company [[Scripps Networks]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diynetwork.com/carol-duvall-bio/bio/index.html|title=Carol Duvall Bio : DIY Network|last=|first=|date=2012-10-08|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008185139/http://www.diynetwork.com/carol-duvall-bio/bio/index.html|archive-date=2012-10-08|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4843">The '''Thomas E. Mathews Community School''' is a [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]]-inspired public school serving [[at-risk students]] in grades 7 through 12 with the goal of their returning to district public schools. T.E. Mathews Community School is located in [[Marysville, California]] and is overseen by the [[Yuba County, California|Yuba County]] Office of Education. The school's mission is "To provide an educational program which reinforces the physical, emotional and intellectual growth of all students, as well as nurturing love of learning that produces positive and productive members of society."&lt;ref name=sarc2010_2011/&gt; 

==Program==
The T. E. Mathews Community School uses group and individual assignments, storytelling, oral recitation, and thematic lessons infused with the arts to help mitigate existing learning problems and help students to work towards earning the credits they need for high school graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hearttohand.org/PDF/Atlantic_Monthly_Schooling_The_Imagination.pdf |title=Schooling the Imagination |last=Oppenheimer |first=Todd |publisher=''[[The Atlantic|Atlantic Monthly]]'' |date=September 1999 |accessdate=23 March 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://education.jhu.edu/PD/newhorizons/strategies/topics/Arts%20in%20Education/monks.htm |title=Waldorf Approach Offers Hope in Schools for Juvenile Offenders |last=Monks |first=Arline |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University]] School of Education |year=1998 |accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special education services are delivered by the classroom teacher who works in conjunction with a resource teacher. Several festivals and assemblies featuring student work are held throughout the year and parents are encouraged to visit the school often. Total enrollment in the 2009-2010 school year was 30 students, 96.7% of whom were classified by the state as being "socioeconomically disadvantaged."&lt;ref name=sarc2010_2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yuba.net/yubaschools/Documents/SARC%20TEM%202010-2011.pdf |title=Executive Summary School Accountability Report Card |work=Executive Summary School Accountability Report Card, 2010-2011 |accessdate=23 March 2013 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student progress==
The T. E. Mathews School met the federal criteria for [[Adequate Yearly Progress]] for the 2009-2010 school year.&lt;ref name=sarc2010_2011/&gt; Preliminary research conducted at Stanford University in 1999 suggested that length of enrollment at T. E. Mathews Community School predicted academic achievement in mathematics and language arts. The author of the study, educational psychologist Ryan Babineaux, felt the students' overall "excellent" academic progress, improved social skills and positive attitude toward school could be attributed to the school's nurturing atmosphere and the dedication of its teachers.&lt;ref name=Monks&gt;{{cite journal |last=Monks |first=Arline |title=Breaking Down the Barriers to Learning: The Power of the Arts |journal=The Journal of Court, Community, and Alternative Schools |year=2001 |issue=Spring |url=http://www.medfordschools.org/Files/Arlene%20Monks%20Article.pdf |quote="Although a full statistical analysis was not performed because of shortcomings in the data, available figures suggest that the longer a student is enrolled in T.E. Mathews the greater the academic development: 62% of the students attending Mathews for at least 3/4 of the year advanced two or more grade levels in math and reading, while 18% of the students enrolled for 1/4 or 1/2 of the year showed the same improvement."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school's approach to working with at-risk students has received scholarly attention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reece|first=Gwendolyn|title=Waldorf-inspired Education and At-risk Students: A Qualitative Case Study of the TE Mathews Community School|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|location=Dissertation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3115">The '''UNISIST model''' of information dissemination was proposed in 1971 by the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;UNISIST Study Report on the feasibility of a World Science Information System, by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the International Council of Scientific Unions. [[Unesco]] Paris 1971. Online: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0006/000648/064862eo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; UNISIST (United Nations International Scientific Information System) is a model of the social system of communication, which consists of knowledge producers, intermediaries, and users. These groups of people (or actors) are different kinds of professionals. The social system also contains institutes such as research institutes, publishers, and libraries. The actors and institutions perform information services such as writing, publishing, storing and retrieving documents and information. The actors are communicating in both formal and informal ways and they are producing different kinds of documents such as journal articles, books, book reviews, proceedings, bibliographies and catalogues, dictionaries, handbooks, encyclopedias and review articles.

The UNISIST model can be used to define relations between various kinds of scientific and scholarly documents and to compare various domains and their discursive practices. It provides a classification of documents and information services into primary, secondary and tertiary services and products. 

The original UNISIST model has been updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Søndergaard | first1 = T.

# to emphasize differences between different knowledge domains and their structures of communication
# to reflect the changes in scientific and scholarly communication facilitated by the Internet and information technologies

'''Undeb Cenedlaethol Athrawon Cymru''' ([[Welsh-language|Welsh]], the sole official name, meaning 'National Union of Teachers of Wales') commonly referred to as '''UCAC''', was formed in [[Wales]] from a split from the [[National Union of Teachers|NUT]] in the late 40's over the issue of the [[Welsh language]] in teaching. It has around 4,000 members, who are nearly all Welsh speakers, representing mainly teachers in Welsh medium schools or teachers of Welsh in English medium schools. It accounts for about 15% of the total teacher workforce in Wales.

It is affiliated to the UK [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] (since 1994), since under current TUC rules it is not permissible to affiliate only to TUC Cymru.

Its main office is in [[Aberystwyth]], [[Ceredigion]].

As well as representing its members at all levels it also campaigns for an independent education system for Wales.

The '''United States Agricultural Information Network '''('''USAIN'''), created in 1988, provides a forum for issues in agricultural information, provides a leadership role in the formation of national information policy for agriculture, and advises the [[National Agricultural Library]].&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, B. S. and Paris-Greider, A. Eds.(2002). ''Using the agricultural, environmental, and food literature.'' New York: Marcel Dekker. p.288. (Books in library and information science: 61)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, W. and Pellen, R. M. Eds. ''Evolving Internet Reference Resources.'' Binghamton, NY: The Haworth Information Press. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The original network was based on a recommendation from the 1982 Interagency Panel of the National Agricultural Library (NAL).&lt;ref&gt;National Agricultural Library Assessment Report. http://www.nal.usda.gov/assessment/AC.html&lt;nowiki/&gt; {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325234538/http://www.nal.usda.gov/assessment/AC.html |date=2014-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of a network of public and private agricultural libraries and information centers coordinated by the NAL. Originally, the Executive Council was composed of representatives from land grant and other institutions, and the director of NAL, in an ex-officio capacity. By 1995, the Executive Committee moved from an organization-based network to an individual-based organization, transferring the responsibility for the operations to individuals. At the 1995 USAIN Conference held in Lexington, Kentucky, a slate of grassroots-working agricultural information professionals emerged as the new Executive Council.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, S.E.(1989). United States Agricultural Information Network: genesis of a cooperative organization. ''Special Libraries,'' 80, 113-117.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Preservation Program ===
USAIN’s preservation plan for agricultural literature, one of the first discipline-based plans, obtained several rounds of funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities and resulted in 29 state projects,&lt;ref&gt;UK Libraries garners national funding to preserve state’s literature on agriculture and rural life.(2006) Southeastern Librarian; Winter 2006/2007, 54(4) p.16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paster, A. &amp; Paulson, J.(2013).

''Quarterly bulletin of the International Association of Agricultural Information Specialists = Bulletin trimestriel de l'Association internationale des specialistes de l'information agricole.'' 42(2) pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt;

USAIN recently partnered with [[Agriculture Network Information Center]] (AgNIC)&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council (U.S.) Committee for a future strategy for transportation information management/ Transportation Research Board of the National Academies.

'''Wendy L. Watson Nelson''' (born 1950)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wendy L. Watson|url=https://mormonarts.lib.byu.edu/people/wendy-l-watson/|website=Mormon Literature &amp; Creative Arts Database|publisher=Harold B. Lee Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Canadian-American marriage and family therapist, and professor. She worked with the Family Nursing Unit at the [[University of Calgary]] (U of C) from 1983 to 1992, training graduate students to use [[Family therapy|family systems therapy]] with families of patients. Her academic work in articles and in the book ''Beliefs: The Heart of Healing in Families and Illness'' helped develop a practical and theoretical framework for family systems nursing. She is the wife of [[Russell M. Nelson]], president of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

==Education==
Wendy Watson grew up in [[Raymond, Alberta]]. She is the second of three children born to Leonard David and Laura McLean Watson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sterzer|first1=Rachel|title=RootsTech 2016: Close friends Wendy Watson Nelson and Sheri Dew discuss family history|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865647488/RootsTech-2016-Close-friends-Wendy-Watson-Nelson-and-Sheri-Dew-discuss-family-history.html|accessdate=April 5, 2018|work=DeseretNews.com|date=February 11, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marriage/&gt; She studied at the [[Calgary General Hospital]] School of Nursing for her RN certification in 1970.&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;  She earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in psychology from the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] in 1973 and a [[master's degree]] in marriage and family therapy at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) in 1975.&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;

==Career==
Beginning in 1980, Watson practiced as a marriage and family therapist part-time, which she continued until at least 2004.&lt;ref name=vita/&gt; She started teaching at the U of C as an assistant professor in the faculty of nursing in 1981,&lt;ref name=vita&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watson|first1=Wendy L.|title=Marriage &amp; Family Therapy - Dr. Wendy L.

Watson co-edited ''The Cutting Edge of Family Nursing'' in 1990, in which she co-authored a chapter describing the Family Nursing Unit (FNU) at the U of C, a unit that provided family therapy to patients and training to graduate nursing students. This work was a clinical application of the family systems nursing taught at the University's nursing program. The family systems nursing approach used knowledge of nursing and family therapy to focus on the family as the "unit of care", where "the family's ability to change depends upon their ability to alter their perception of the problem".&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Bell|editor1-first=J.M.|editor2-last=Watson|editor2-first=W.L.|editor3-last=Wright|editor3-first=L.M.|title=The Cutting  Edge of Family Nursing|date=1990|publisher=Family Nursing Unit Publications|location=Calgary, Alberta|url=https://dspace.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/45100/3/FNU_CuttingEdge.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|95–97}} Watson was the education coordinator in the FNU from 1983 to 1992.&lt;ref name=vita/&gt; In her work with the FNU, she wrote and produced five educational videos.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;{{rp|104}} The U of C awarded her a Teaching Excellence Award in 1991.&lt;ref name=vita/&gt;

In 1993, she joined BYU's [[BYU College of Family, Home and Social Sciences|school of family life]] as an associate professor in the marriage and family therapy graduate program.&lt;ref name=vita/&gt; From 1994 to 1997, she was a reviewer for the ''[[Journal of Family Nursing]]''.&lt;ref name=vita/&gt; In 1996, she co-authored with Lorraine M.

Mauksch wrote that the book "extended the application of narrative approaches beyond psychosocial problems to broader, biopsychosocial-spiritual contexts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mauksch|first1=Larry B.|title=Beliefs: The Heart of Healing in Families and Illness|journal=Families, Systems, &amp; Health|date=1997|volume=15|issue=Winter|issn=1091-7527|pages=465–467}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was later translated into Swedish and Japanese.&lt;ref name=vita/&gt; Watson's work on this book and with the Family Nursing Unit is often cited as helping to develop the family systems nursing framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=LeGrow|first1=Karen|last2=Rossen|first2=Beth Ellen|title=Development of Professional Practice Based on a Family Systems Nursing Framework: Nurses' and Families' Experiences|journal=Journal of Family Nursing|date=July 24, 2016|volume=11|issue=1|page=39|doi=10.1177/1074840704273508|quote=Given the attention that "family nursing" has received during the past 2 decades with the development of clinical practice settings (Anderson &amp; Valentine, 1998; Wright, Watson, &amp; Bell, 1990); educational programs (Bell, 1997; Deatrick, Feetham, Hayman, &amp; Perkins, 1993; Hanson &amp; Heims, 1992; Richards &amp; Lansberry, 1995; Wright &amp; Bell, 1989); six international family nursing conferences (Bell, 1996, 2000; Bell, Wright, Leahey, Watson, &amp; Chenger, 1988; Feetham, Meister, Bell, &amp; Gilliss, 1993; Krentz, 1991); publication of family nursing textbooks, several with revised editions (Bomar, 2004; Denham, 2003; Friedemann, 1995; Friedman, Bowden, &amp; Jones, 2003; Hanson, 2001; Vaughan-Cole, Johnson, Malone, &amp; Walker, 1998; Wright &amp; Leahey, 2000); and the Journal of Family Nursing dedicated to family nursing research, practice, theory, and education, nurses are becoming more aware of the need to include families in nursing care.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=Janice M.|title=Family Systems Nursing|journal=Journal of Family Nursing|date=May 7, 2009|volume=15|issue=2|page=125|doi=10.1177/1074840709335533|quote=Despite Segaric and Hall's (2005) critique that the conceptual distinctions between family unit and family systems are still messy, a recent Google Scholar search of the term Family Systems Nursing uncovered 1,950 citations focused on applications of Family Systems Nursing to practice, research, and education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19774">The '''Women's Political Council''', founded in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], was an organization that was part of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] that was formed to address the racial issues in the city. Members included [[Mary Fair Burks]], [[Jo Ann Robinson]], [[Irene West]], [[Thelma Glass]], and Uretta Adair. The WPC was the first group to officially call for a boycott of the bus system during the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]], beginning in December 1955. The group led efforts in the early 1950s to secure better treatment for Black bus passengers, and in December 1955 it initiated the thirteen month bus boycott.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_montgomery_bus_boycott_1955_1956/|title=Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955-1956)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They helped organize communications to get it started, as well as to support it, including giving people rides who were boycotting the buses. The African Americans of Montgomery upheld the boycott for more than a year.

It ended in late December 1956, after the United States Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'' that the state and local laws for bus segregation were unconstitutional, and ordered the state to desegregate public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_montgomery_bus_boycott_1955_1956/|title=Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955-1956)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The WPC formed in 1946 as a civic organization for African-American professional women in the city of Montgomery, Alabama. It was Organized by Mary Fair Burks, the chairperson of the English department at Alabama State College and 40 other women, the WPC was a political organization composed of Alabama State College faculty members and the wives of black professional men throughout the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jamie J.|first1=Wilson|title=Landmarks of The American Mosaic: Civil Rights Movement|date=2013|publisher=Greenwood|location=Santa Barbara, CA|page=35-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was inspired by the [[Atlanta Neighborhood Union]]. Many of its middle-class women were active in education; most of WPC's members were educators at [[Alabama State College]] or Montgomery's public schools. The organization targeted Montgomery's small population of black middle class women, encouraging their civic involvement and promoting voter registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cobb Jr.|first1=Charles E.|title=On the Road to Freedom: A guided tour of the civil rights trail|date=2008|publisher=algoquin books|location=chapel hill|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; About forty women attended the first organizational meeting. [[Mary Fair Burks]], who was head of Alabama State's English department, was the group's first president.&lt;ref name="tierney"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tierney|first=Helen|title=Women's studies encyclopedia, Volume 2|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-31072-0|page=604|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2bDxJW3x4f8C&amp;pg=PA604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burks decided to form the organization after she was arrested after a traffic dispute with a white woman.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/aah/women-s-political-council-montgomery|title=Women's Political Council of Montgomery|last=Christensen|first=Stephanie|date=|website=BlackPast.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's initial purposes were to foster women's involvement in civic affairs, to promote voter registration through citizenship education, and to aid women who were victims of rape or assault. Many African Americans were illiterate due to centuries of oppression and poverty, they would sometimes fail the literacy test they were forced to take.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Yohuru|title=Voting Rights Act|url=http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/voting-rights-act|website=History.com|accessdate=February 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other times, they were told they had come to the wrong location for registration or come on the wrong date. One goal of the WPC was to teach adults to read and write well enough to fulfill the literacy requirements for voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crawford, Rouse, Woods|first1=Vicki L., Jacquline Anne, and Barbara|title=Women in the Civil Rights movement: Trailblazers and Torchbearers !941-1965|date=1993|publisher=Indiana|location=Bloomington|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its most successful programs was an annual event called Youth City, which taught Black high school students about politics and government and "what democracy could and should mean". During election campaigns the WPC worked with the white-only League of Women Voters to inform Black citizens about political candidates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1949, [[Jo Ann Robinson]], a newly hired English professor at Alabama State College, joined the council. Her firsthand experiences with segregated seating on buses prompted Robinson to succeed Burks as WPC president in 1950 and to shift the council's primary focus to challenging the seating policy. She organized the Women's Political Council and within a month's time they had over a hundred members. They organized a second chapter and a third, and soon they had more than 300 members. They had members in every elementary, junior high, and senior high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Juan|title=Eyes on the prize: Americas civil rights years 1954-1965|date=2002|publisher=penguin books|location=new york}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had them organized from federal and state and local jobs; Wherever there were more than 10 blacks employed, they had a member there.Under her leadership the council grew to over 200 members and expanded to three chapters in different areas of the city.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Eventually, there were around three hundred members and all of them were registered to vote.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

As president, she began to study the issue of bus segregation, which affected the many blacks who were the majority of riders on the city system. First, members appeared before the City Commission to report abuses on the buses, such as blacks who were first on the bus being required later to give up seats for whites as buses became crowded. The commission acted surprised but did nothing.

==Bus boycott==

In Montgomery, black women especially were regularly humiliated by the bus service. Jo Ann Robinson sat down in the white section of a city bus one day without thinking. She was brought to tears by the bus driver who cursed her out for sitting there. The Women's political council was formed because of these indignities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cobb Jr.|first1=Charles E&gt;|title=On the Road to Freedom: A guided Tour of the civil rights trail|date=2008|publisher=Algonquin books|location=chapel hill|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;During the early 1950s WPC leaders met regularly with Mayor W.A. Gayle and the city commission to lobby for bus reforms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;They complained that the city did not hire any black bus drivers, said that segregation of seating was unjust, and that bus stops in black neighborhoods were farther apart than in white ones, although blacks were the majority of the riders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/chwe/ps269/shultziner.pdf|title=THE SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGICAL ORIGINS OF THE MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT: SOCIAL INTERACTION AND HUMILIATION IN THE EMERGENCE OF SOCIAL MOVEMENTS|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although they succeeded in pressuring the city to hire its first Black police officers, they made no progress in their effort to ameliorate bus segregation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Robinson and other WPC members met with bus company officials on their own. The segregation issue was deflected, as bus company officials said that segregation was city and state law. The WPC achieved a small victory, as the bus company officials agreed to have the buses stop at every corner in black neighborhoods, as was the practice in white neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peake|first=Linda|year=2015|title=The Suzanne Mackenzie Memorial Lecture: Rethinking the politics of feminist knowledge production in Anglo-American geography|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cag.12174/full|journal=The Suzanne Mackenzie Memorial Lecture: Rethinking the politics of feminist knowledge production in Anglo-American geography|volume=|pages=257-266|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1954, shortly after the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' [[United States Supreme Court]] decision was announced, Robinson wrote a letter to Mayor W. A. Gayle saying that there was growing support among local black organizations for a bus boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Daybreak of freedom: The Montgomery bus boycott|last=Stewart|first=Burns|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=http://uncpress.unc.edu/books/T-222.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1955, there was growing dissatisfaction with the segregated bus system. The WPC decided that when the right person got arrested, they would initiate a boycott. When [[Claudette Colvin]], a fifteen-year-old high school student was arrested in March 1955, for refusing to give up her seat, the WPC and other local civil rights organizations began to discuss a boycott.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Extremist for Love: Martin Luther King Jr., Man of Ideas and Nonviolent Social Action|last=Burrow|first=Rufus|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=9781451480276|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colvin's arrest and conviction angered and unified the Black community, but when they discovered that the unmarried Colvin was pregnant, they did not want to use her as the point person, as she would not have commanded support among the religious and conservative blacks. 

[[Rosa Parks]], the secretary of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP, was arrested in December 1955; she, the NAACP, and the WPC agreed that she could be the lead for a boycott. At a meeting of about fifty people in the basement of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, a part of the 1965 historic route of the Selma to Montgomery trial, on December 2, 1955 Rosa Parks first told the story of her arrest and the group decided to mount a bus boycott. What participants initially decided was to have a one-day boycott on Monday December 5, but because the boycott that day was so successful, discussion of continuing it began at a meeting afterward at the church due to the fact that roughly 70 percent of Montgomery's bus passengers were black and most stayed off the buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cobb Jr.|first1=Charles E.|title=On the Road to Freedom: A guided tour of the civil rights trail|date=2008|publisher=algoquin books|location=chapel hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few years earlier, the minister of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church had tried to prompt a group of blacks to walk off a bus in protest. The driver had ordered Reverend Vernon Johns to get up and let a white man sit down. Johns stood up and challenged the other blacks to march off the bus with him. Asking blacks to protest was asking a lot. They could expect to be fired from their jobs and harassed on the streets, ad could possibly become victims of an economic boycott on the part of the white segregationists. A successful bus boycott would need to be mapped out carefully and executed with discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Juan|title=Eyes on the prize: American Civil rights years 1954-1965|date=2002|publisher=Penguin books|location=New york}}&lt;/ref&gt;Robinson was consulted by E.D. Nixon, president of the NAACP. The night of Parks' arrest, Robinson called the other WPC leaders, and they agreed that this was the right time for a bus boycott.{{cn|date=May 2018}} Rosa was a longtime NAACP activist who was deeply respected and seemed like the ideal community symbol around which to mobilize a mass protest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Robinson stayed up all night copying 35,000 handbills by a mimeograph machine at Alabama State College to distribute the next day. She called students and arranged to meet them at elementary and high schools in the morning. She drove to the various schools to drop the handbills off to the students who would distribute them in the schools and ask students to take them home for their parents. Robinson did not put her name or that of the Women's Political Council on the handbills. She feared the city and state officials would realize she had used the mimeograph machine at Alabama State and, in revenge, cut off funds for the all-black school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Juan|title=Eyes on the prize: Americas civil rights years 1954-1965|date=2002|publisher=penguin books|location=new york}}&lt;/ref&gt; The handbills asked blacks to boycott the buses the following Monday, December 5, in support of Parks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Montgomery bus boycott and the women who started it: The memoir of Jo Ann Gibson Robinson|last=Robinson|first=Jo Ann|publisher=Univ. of Tennessee Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thelma Glass]] and her students helped distribute fliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.montgomeryboycott.com/profile_glass.htm|title=Thelma Glass|last=Pippins|first=Erica|date=|newspaper=The Montgomery Advertiser|access-date=20 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416180551/http://www.montgomeryboycott.com/profile_glass.htm|archive-date=16 April 2007|dead-url=|work=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By Friday night, word of a boycott had spread all over the city. That same night, local ministers and civil rights leaders held a meeting and announced the boycott for Monday. With some ministers hesitant to engage their congregations in a boycott, about half left the meeting in frustration. They decided to hold a mass meeting Monday night to decide if the boycott should continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Montgomery bus boycott and the women who started it: The memoir of Jo Ann Gibson Robinson.|last=Robinson|first=Jo Ann|publisher=Univ. of Tennessee  Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The one-day boycott was so successful that the organizers met on Monday night and decided to continue. They established the [[Montgomery Improvement Association]] to organize the boycott and elected the Reverend [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] as president. Jo Ann Robinson served on the group's executive board and edited their newsletter. In order to protect her position at Alabama State College and her colleagues, she stayed out of the limelight. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;Robinson and other WPC members helped sustain the boycott by providing car transportation for many boycotters.

On February 1, 1956, associated lawyers filed a civil suit, ''[[Browder v. Gayle]],'' in the [[United States District Court]], on behalf of five women who had each been arrested for defying bus segregation (one dropped out that month.) A three-judge panel ruled on June 13, 1956, that bus segregation was unconstitutional, and the case went to the US Supreme Court. It upheld the lower court ruling on December 17, 1956, and three days later ordered the state to desegregate the buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women in the Civil Rights Movement: Trailblazers and Torchbearers|last=Bruks|first=Mary Fair|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-253-20832-7|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boycott had demonstrated African-American organizing power and highlighted civil rights issues in the city. Its success helped further steps in the drive for civil rights.

=== Members After The Women Political Council ===
Robinson and Burks left Montgomery in 1960, after several Alabama State College professors were fired for civil rights activities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Robinson left Alabama State College in 1960 after several teachers had been fired for their participation in the boycott. She taught for one year at Grambling State College in Grambling, Louisiana, then moved to Los Angeles, where she taught English in the public schools until 1976, when she retired. After retiring, Robinson remained active in a host of civic and social groups, giving one day a week of free service to the city of Los Angeles and serving in the League of Women Voters, the Alpha Gamma Omega chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, the Angel City chapter of the Links, the Black Women's Alliance, the Founders Church of Religious Science, and Women on Target. In 1987 Robinson published her memoir about the boycott, ''The Montgomery Bus Boycott and the Women Who Started It'', which won the publication prize by the Southern Association for Women's Historians. Through her historical work, Robinson helped restore women to their proper place in the Montgomery boycott, and through her political commitment, she helped launch one of the most important civil rights struggles in the Jim Crow South.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Women in America: an historical encyclopedia|last=Hine,Brown|first=Darlene, Elsa|publisher=Brooklyn N.Y. Carlson Publ|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=987|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Burks resigned from Alabama State College after several professors were fired for their involvement in civil rights issues. She then taught literature at the University of Maryland until her retirement in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unsung Heroines of the Civil Rights Movement from 1830 to 1970|last=Olson|first=Lynne|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=131|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Burks was appointed to a National Endowment for the Humanities reviewing panel in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o6s7AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7ikMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5382,3070650&amp;dq=mary-fair-burks&amp;hl=en|title=Baltimore Afro American|last=|first=|date=1979|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decline of the Women Political Council ===
The success of the boycott and the rise of the Montgomery Improvement Association contributed to the organization's decline. The MIA was created to direct the boycott, as a result the WPC leadership role in the black community was diminished. Younger women reinvigorated the council, guided by older members serving as role models. Robinson stated in her memoir that "Members felt that young, concerned women, with their futures ahead, would benefit by the WPC and that we would help them to organize and select goals and directions for their future." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Information is not available on the extent to which the younger women became involved in the later civil rights movement in Montgomery and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
