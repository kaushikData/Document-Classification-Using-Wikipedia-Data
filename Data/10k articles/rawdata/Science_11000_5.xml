According to ancient and [[History of science in the Middle Ages|medieval science]], '''aether''' ({{lang-grc|αἰθήρ}}, ''aither''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=ether |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=4th |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=2006 |isbn=978-0618701728 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), also spelled '''æther''' or '''ether''' and also called '''quintessence''', is the material that fills the region of the [[universe]] above the [[Sublunary sphere|terrestrial sphere]].&lt;ref name="smoot" /&gt; The concept of aether was used in several theories to explain several natural phenomena, such as the traveling of light and gravity. In the late 19th century, physicists postulated that aether permeated all throughout space, providing a medium through which light could travel in a [[vacuum]], but evidence for the presence of such a medium was not found in the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]], and this result has been interpreted as meaning that no such [[luminiferous aether]] exists.&lt;ref&gt;Carl S. Helrich, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aRpJJXc-LCIC&amp;pg=PA26 ''The Classical Theory of Fields: Electromagnetism''] Berlin, Springer 2012, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythological origins==
{{main|Aether (mythology)}}
{{see also|Empyrean}}
The word  {{lang|grc|αἰθήρ}} (''aithēr'') in [[Homeric Greek]] means "pure, fresh air" or "clear sky". In [[Greek mythology]], it was thought to be the pure essence that the gods breathed, filling the space where they lived, analogous to the ''[[Air (classical element)|air]]'' breathed by mortals.&lt;ref name="gm.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Aether/aether.html |title=Aether |publisher=GreekMythology.com |accessdate=20 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220225142/http://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/Aether/aether.html |archivedate=20 December 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also personified as a deity, [[Aether (mythology)|Aether]], the son of [[Erebus]] and [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]] in traditional Greek mythology.&lt;ref name="gm.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Aither.html|title = AITHER|date = |access-date = January 16, 2016|website = AETHER : Greek protogenos god of upper air &amp; light ; mythology : AITHER|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aether is related to {{lang|grc|αἴθω}} "to incinerate",&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Pokorny|Pokorny, Julius]] (1959).

==Fifth element==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Classical element]] --&gt;
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|Medieval concept of the cosmos. The innermost spheres are the terrestrial spheres, while the outer are made of aether and contain the celestial bodies]]
In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (58d) speaking about air, Plato mentions that "there is the most translucent kind which is called by the name of aether (αίθηρ)".&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]],  ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text;jsessionid=1C8F72843B9D65CB4C634D700A6E694C?doc=Plat.+Tim.+58d 58d].&lt;/ref&gt; but otherwise he adopted the classical system of four elements. [[Aristotle]], who had been Plato's student at the [[Akademia]], agreed on this point with his former mentor, emphasizing additionally that fire sometimes has been mistaken for aether. However, in his Book ''[[On the Heavens]]'' he introduced a new "first" element to the system of the [[classical element]]s of [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian]] [[Greek philosophy|philosophy]]. He noted that the four terrestrial classical elements were subject to change and naturally moved linearly. The first element however, located in the celestial regions and heavenly bodies, moved circularly and had none of the qualities the terrestrial classical elements had. It was neither hot nor cold, neither wet nor dry. With this addition the system of elements was extended to five and later commentators started referring to the new first one as the fifth and also called it ''aether'', a word that Aristotle had not used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hahm |first1=David E. |title=The fifth element in Aristotle's ''De Philosophia'': A Critical Re-Examination |journal=The Journal of Hellenic Studies |date=1982 |volume=102 |pages=60–74 |doi=10.2307/631126|jstor=631126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aether did not follow [[Aristotelian physics]] either. Aether was also incapable of motion of quality or motion of quantity. Aether was only capable of local motion. Aether naturally moved in circles, and had no contrary, or unnatural, motion.&lt;ref&gt;[[G. E. R. Lloyd]]), ''Aristotle: The Growth and Structure of his Thought'', Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1968, pp. 133-139, {{ISBN|0-521-09456-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle also noted that crystalline spheres made of aether held the celestial bodies. The idea of crystalline spheres and natural circular motion of aether led to Aristotle's explanation of the observed orbits of stars and planets in perfectly circular motion in crystalline aether.&lt;ref name="smoot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aether.lbl.gov/www/classes/p10/aristotle-physics.html |title=Aristotle's Physics |author=George Smoot III |website=lbl.gov |accessdate=20 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220230803/http://aether.lbl.gov/www/classes/p10/aristotle-physics.html |archivedate=20 December 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval scholastic philosophers granted ''aether'' changes of density, in which the bodies of the planets were considered to be more dense than the medium which filled the rest of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Edward|title=Planets, Stars, &amp; Orbs: The Medieval Cosmos, 1200-1687|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge [England]|isbn=978-0-521-56509-7|pages=322–428|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Fludd]] stated that the aether was of the character that it was "subtler than light". Fludd cites the 3rd-century view of [[Plotinus]], concerning the aether as penetrative and non-material.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Fludd, "Mosaical Philosophy". London, Humphrey Moseley, 1659. Pg 221.&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Arche]].

==Quintessence==
Quintessence is the [[Latinate]] name of the fifth element used by medieval alchemists for a medium similar or identical to that thought to make up the heavenly bodies. It was noted that there was very little presence of quintessence within the terrestrial sphere. Due to the low presence of quintessence, earth could be affected by what takes place within the heavenly bodies.&lt;ref name="TheAlchemists"&gt;''The Alchemists'', by F. Sherwood Taylor page 95&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was developed in the 14th century text ''The testament of Lullius'', attributed to [[Ramon Llull]]. The use of quintessence became popular within medieval alchemy. Quintessence stemmed from the medieval elemental system, which consisted of the four classical elements, and aether, or quintessence, in addition to two chemical elements representing metals: [[sulphur]], "the stone which burns", which characterized the principle of combustibility, and [[mercury (element)|mercury]], which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties.

This elemental system spread rapidly throughout all of Europe and became popular with alchemists, especially in medicinal alchemy. Medicinal alchemy then sought to isolate quintessence and incorporate it within medicine and elixirs.&lt;ref name="TheAlchemists" /&gt; Due to quintessence's pure and heavenly quality, it was thought that through consumption one may rid oneself of any impurities or illnesses. In ''The book of Quintessence'', a 15th-century English translation of a continental text, quintessence was used as a medicine for many of man's illnesses. A process given for the creation of quintessence is [[distillation]] of alcohol seven times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stavacademy.co.uk/mimir/quintessence.htm ''The book of Quintessence''], Early English Text society original series number 16, edited by F. J. Furnivall&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, the term quintessence has become synonymous with [[elixirs]], medicinal [[alchemy]], and the [[philosopher's stone]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dictionary of Alchemy'', by Mark Haeffner&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
{{main|Aether theories}}
With the [[History of physics#18th-century developments|18th century physics developments]], physical models known as "aether theories" made use of a similar concept for the explanation of the propagation of electromagnetic and gravitational forces. As early as the 1670s, Newton used the idea of aether to help match observations to strict mechanical rules of his physics.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Osler, ''Reconfiguring the World.'' The Johns Hopkins University Press 2010. (155).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the early modern aether had little in common with the aether of classical elements from which the name was borrowed. These aether theories are considered to be scientifically obsolete, as the development of [[special relativity]] showed that Maxwell's equations do not require the aether for the transmission of these forces. However, Einstein himself noted that his own model which replaced these theories could itself be thought of as an aether, as it implied that the empty space between objects had its own physical properties.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert: "Ether and the Theory of Relativity" (1920), republished in Sidelights on Relativity (Methuen, London, 1922)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the early modern aether models being superseded by general relativity, occasionally some physicists have attempted to reintroduce the concept of aether in an attempt to address perceived deficiencies in current physical models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dirac | first1 = Paul | year = 1951 | title = Is there an Aether? | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 168 | issue = 4282| pages = 906–907 | doi=10.1038/168906a0|bibcode = 1951Natur.168..906D }}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed model of [[dark energy]] has been named "[[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]]" by its proponents, in honor of the classical element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zlatev | first1 = I. | last2 = Wang | first2 = L. | last3 = Steinhardt | first3 = P. | year = 1999 | title = Quintessence, Cosmic Coincidence, and the Cosmological Constant | url = http://cds.cern.ch/record/358722| journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 82 | issue = 5| pages = 896–899 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.896 | bibcode=1999PhRvL..82..896Z|arxiv = astro-ph/9807002 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea relates to the hypothecial form of dark energy postulated as an explanation of observations of an accelerating universe. It has also been called a [[Fifth force|fifth fundamental force]].

===Aether and light===
{{main|Luminiferous aether}}
The motion of light was a long-standing investigation in physics for hundreds of years before the 20th century. The use of aether to describe this motion was popular during the 17th and 18th centuries, including a theory proposed by [[Johann II Bernoulli]], who was recognized in 1736 with the prize of the French Academy. In his theory, all space is permeated by aether containing "excessively small whirlpools". These whirlpools allow for aether to have a certain elasticity, transmitting vibrations from the corpuscular packets of light as they travel through.&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, Edmund Taylor, ''A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity from the Age of Descartes to the Close of the 19th Century'' (1910), pp. 101-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory of [[luminiferous aether]] would influence the [[wave|wave theory]] of light proposed by [[Christiaan Huygens]], in which light traveled in the form of [[longitudinal waves]]  via an "omnipresent, perfectly elastic medium having zero density, called aether". At the time, it was thought that in order for light to travel through a vacuum, there must have been a medium filling the void through which it could propagate, as sound through air or ripples in a pool. Later, when it was proved that the nature of light wave is [[transverse wave|transverse]] instead of longitudinal, Huygens' theory was replaced by subsequent theories proposed by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and [[Louis-Victor de Broglie|de Broglie]], which rejected the existence and necessity of aether to explain the various optical phenomena. These theories were supported by the results of the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] in which evidence for the motion of aether was conclusively absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Michelson |first=Albert A. |title=The Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether |journal = American Journal of Science |volume = 22 |issue=128 |year = 1881 |pages = 120–129 |doi=10.2475/ajs.s3-22.128.120|title-link=s:The Relative Motion of the Earth and the Luminiferous Ether |bibcode=1881AmJS...22..120M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the experiment influenced many physicists of the time and contributed to the eventual development of Einstein's [[special relativity|theory of special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shankland | first1 = R. S. | year = 1964 | title = Michelson-Morley Experiment | url = | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 32 | issue = 1| page = 16 | doi = 10.1119/1.1970063 |bibcode = 1964AmJPh..32...16S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aether and gravitation===
[[File:GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg|thumbnail|Sir Isaac Newton]]
Aether has been used in various gravitational theories as a medium to help explain gravitation and what causes it. It was used in one of Sir [[Isaac Newton]]'s first published theories of gravitation, ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (the ''Principia''). He based the whole description of planetary motions on a theoretical law of dynamic interactions. He renounced standing attempts at accounting for this particular form of interaction between distant bodies by introducing a mechanism of propagation through an intervening medium.&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld1969"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenfeld |first1=L. |title=Newton's views on aether and gravitation |journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences |date=1969 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=29–37 |doi=10.1007/BF00327261}}&lt;/ref&gt; He calls this intervening medium aether. In his aether model, Newton describes aether as a medium that "flows" continually downward toward the Earth's surface and is partially absorbed and partially diffused. This "circulation" of aether is what he associated the force of gravity with to help explain the action of gravity in a non-mechanical fashion.&lt;ref name="Rosenfeld1969"/&gt; This theory described different aether densities, creating an aether density gradient. His theory also explains that aether was dense within objects and rare without them. As particles of denser aether interacted with the rare aether they were attracted back to the dense aether much like cooling vapors of water are attracted back to each other to form water.&lt;ref name="newton1679"/&gt; In the ''Principia'' he attempts to explain the elasticity and movement of aether by relating aether to his static model of fluids. This elastic interaction is what caused the pull of gravity to take place, according to this early theory, and allowed an explanation for action at a distance instead of action through direct contact. Newton also explained this changing rarity and density of aether in his letter to [[Robert Boyle]] in 1679.&lt;ref name="newton1679"&gt;Newton, Isaac.[http://www.orgonelab.org/newtonletter.htm "Isaac Newton to Robert Boyle, 1679."] 28 February 1679.&lt;/ref&gt; He illustrated aether and its field around objects in this letter as well and used this as a way to inform Robert Boyle about his theory.&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orgonelab.org/newtonletter.htm |title=Isaac Newton's Letter to Robert Boyle, on the Cosmic Ether of Space - 1679 |author=James DeMeo |year=2009 |website=orgonelab.org |accessdate=20 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220231449/http://www.orgonelab.org/newtonletter.htm |archivedate=20 December 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Newton eventually changed his theory of gravitation to one involving force and the laws of motion, his starting point for the modern understanding and explanation of gravity came from his original aether model on gravitation.&lt;ref name="robishaw"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KkS9CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=newton+robert+boyle+aether#v=onepage&amp;q=newton%20robert%20boyle%20aether&amp;f=false |title=The Esoteric Codex: Esoteric Cosmology |author=Andrew Robishaw |page=6 |date=9 April 2015 |publisher=Lulu.com |accessdate=20 December 2016 |isbn=9781329053083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Anglo-Australian Near-Earth Asteroid Survey''' ('''AANEAS''') operated from 1990-96, becoming one of the most prolific programs of its type in the world. Apart from leading to the discovery of 38 [[near-Earth asteroid]]s, 9 [[comet]]s, 63 [[supernova]]e, several other astronomical phenomena and the delivery of a substantial proportion of all NEA [[astrometry]] obtained worldwide (e.g., 30% in 1994-95), AANEAS also led to many other scientific advances{{What|date=February 2010}} which were reported in the refereed literature.

[[File:Czech-2013-Prague-Astronomical clock face.jpg|thumb|400px|Face of the [[Prague Astronomical Clock|Astronomical Clock]], in [[Old Town Square]], Prague.]]

An '''astronomical clock''' is a [[clock]] with special [[mechanism (technology)|mechanisms]] and [[dial (measurement)|dials]] to display [[astronomical]] information, such as the relative positions of the [[sun]], [[moon]], [[zodiac]]al [[constellation]]s, and sometimes major [[planet]]s.

== Definition ==

The term is loosely used to refer to any clock that shows, in addition to the time of day, astronomical information. This could include the location of the sun and moon in the sky, the age and [[Lunar phases]], the position of the sun on the ecliptic and the current zodiac sign, the [[sidereal time]], and other astronomical data such as the moon's nodes (for indicating [[eclipses]]) or a rotating star map. The term should not be confused with ''astronomical regulator'', a high precision but otherwise ordinary [[pendulum clock]] used in observatories.

Astronomical clocks usually represent the solar system using the [[geocentric]] model. The center of the dial is often marked with a disc or sphere representing the earth, located at the center of the solar system. The sun is often represented by a golden sphere (as it initially appeared in the [[Antikythera Mechanism]], back in the 2nd century BC), shown rotating around the earth once a day around a [[24-hour analog dial]]. This view accorded both with the daily experience and with the philosophical world view of pre-[[Copernican Revolution|Copernican]] Europe.

Research in 2011 and 2012 led an expert group of researchers to posit that European astronomical clocks are descended from the technology of the Antikythera mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;PBS (2013).

In the 11th century, the [[Song dynasty]] Chinese horologist, mechanical engineer, and astronomer [[Su Song]] created a [[water clock|water-driven astronomical clock]] for his clock-tower of [[Kaifeng]] City. Su Song is noted for having incorporated an [[escapement]] mechanism and earliest known endless power-transmitting [[chain drive]] for his clock-tower and [[armillary sphere]] to function.

The early development of mechanical clocks in Europe is not fully understood, but there is general agreement that by 1300–1330 there existed mechanical clocks (powered by weights rather than by water and using an [[escapement]]) which were intended for two main purposes: for signalling and notification (e.g. the timing of services and public events), and for modelling the solar system. The latter is an inevitable development, because the [[astrolabe]] was used both by astronomers and astrologers, and it was natural to apply a clockwork drive to the rotating plate to produce a working model of the solar system. American historian [[Lynn Townsend White Jr.|Lynn White Jr.]] of Princeton University wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=White | first=Lynn Jr. | title=Medieval Technology and Social Change | year=1966 | publisher=Oxford Press}}, p.122-123&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|Most of the first clocks were not so much chronometers as exhibitions of the pattern of the cosmos … Clearly the origins of the mechanical clock lie in a complex realm of monumental planetaria, equatoria, and geared astrolabes.}}
The astronomical clocks developed by the English mathematician and cleric [[Richard of Wallingford]] in [[St Albans]] during the 1330s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whyte|first=Nicholas|title=The Astronomical Clock of Richard of Wallingford|publisher=personal website|url=http://www.nicholaswhyte.info/row.htm|accessdate=24 April 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080504082935/http://www.nicholaswhyte.info/row.htm| archivedate= 4 May 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by medieval Italian physician and astronomer [[Giovanni de Dondi]] in [[Padua]] between 1348 and 1364&lt;ref name="Astrarium"&gt;{{cite web|last=Burnett-Stuart|first=George|title=De Dondi's Astrarium|work=Almagest|publisher=Computastat Group Ltd.|url=http://www.almagest.co.uk/middle/astrar.htm|accessdate=21 April 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080530194815/http://www.almagest.co.uk/middle/astrar.htm| archivedate= 30 May 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; are masterpieces of their type. They no longer exist, but detailed descriptions of their design and construction survive, and modern reproductions have been made. Wallingford's clock may have shown the sun, moon (age, phase, and node), stars and planets, and had, in addition, a wheel of fortune and an indicator of the state of the tide at London Bridge. De Dondi's clock was a seven-faced construction with 107 moving parts, showing the positions of the sun, moon, and five planets, as well as religious feast days.&lt;ref name="Astrarium" /&gt;

Both these clocks, and others like them, were probably less accurate than their designers would have wished. The gear ratios may have been exquisitely calculated, but their manufacture was somewhat beyond the mechanical abilities of the time, and they never worked reliably. Furthermore, in contrast to the intricate advanced wheelwork, the timekeeping mechanism in nearly all these clocks until the 16th century was the simple [[verge and foliot]] escapement, which had errors of at least half an hour a day.

Astronomical clocks were built as demonstration or exhibition pieces, to impress as much as to educate or inform. The challenge of building these masterpieces meant that clockmakers would continue to produce them, to demonstrate their technical skill and their patrons' wealth. The philosophical message of an ordered, heavenly-ordained universe, which accorded with the Gothic era view of the world, helps explain their popularity.

The growing interest in astronomy during the 18th century revived interest in astronomical clocks, less for the philosophical message, more for the accurate astronomical information that [[pendulum]]-regulated clocks could display.

=== Rouen, ''Le Gros Horloge'' ===
[[File:Le_Gros_Horloge,_Rouen,_Normandy.jpg|thumb|''Le [[Gros Horloge]]'']]
''Le [[Gros Horloge]]'' in [[Rouen]] is one of the earliest known astronomical clocks. The clock is installed in a Renaissance arch crossing the Rue du Gros-Horloge. The mechanism is one of the oldest in France; the movement was made in 1389. Construction of the clock was started by Jourdain del Leche, who lacked the necessary expertise to finish the task,&lt;ref name="green-lion"&gt;[http://www.green-lion.net/rouen_zodiac_clock.html "Le Gros Horloge"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814010116/http://www.green-lion.net/rouen_zodiac_clock.html |date=14 August 2011 }} green-lion.net&lt;/ref&gt; so the work was completed by Jean de Felain, who became the first to hold the position of governor of the clock.&lt;ref&gt;Tanguy, Jacques (2006). [http://www.rouen-histoire.com/GHorloge/GrosHorloge.htm "Le Gros-Horloge"]&lt;/ref&gt; The clock was originally constructed without a dial, with one revolution of the hour-hand representing twenty-four hours.&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Brittany and Normandy|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|first=Peter |last=Dragicevich|year=2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AwgnmMTOgTAC&amp;pg=PA238|page=238|isbn=9781741042382}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is cast in wrought iron, and at approximately twice the size of the [[Wells Cathedral clock]], it is perhaps the largest such mechanism still extant.&lt;ref name="green-lion" /&gt; A facade was added in 1529 when the clock was moved to its current position.&lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt; The Renaissance facade represents a golden sun with 24 rays on a starry blue background. The dial measures 2.5 metres in diameter.

The phases of the moon are shown in the [[oculus]] of the upper part of the dial. It completes a full rotation in 29 days. The week days are shown in an opening at the base of the dial with allegorical subjects for each day of the week.

=== Su Sung's Cosmic Engine ===
The [[Science Museum (London)]] has a scale model of the 'Cosmic Engine', which [[Su Sung]], a Chinese [[polymath]], designed and constructed in China in 1092. This great astronomical hydromechanical clock tower was about ten metres high (about 30 feet) and featured a clock [[escapement]] and was indirectly powered by rotating wheel either with falling water and [[mercury (element)|liquid mercury]], which freezes at a much lower temperature than water, allowing operation of the clock during colder weather. A full-sized working replica of Su Sung's clock exists in the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan)'s [[National Museum of Natural Science]], [[Taichung]] city. This full-scale, fully functional replica, approximately {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in height, was constructed from Su Sung's original descriptions and mechanical drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmns.edu.tw/nmns_eng/04exhibit/permanent/tower.htm|title=National Museum of Natural Science -&gt; Exhibition -&gt; Permanent Exhibits|work=nmns.edu.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Al-Jazari's castle clock ===
{{Main article|Castle clock}}

The most sophisticated [[Water clock|water-powered]] astronomical clock was [[Al-Jazari]]'s castle clock, considered to be an early example of a [[Computer programming|programmable]] [[analog computer]], in 1206. It was a complex device that was about {{convert|33|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} high, and had multiple functions alongside timekeeping. It included a display of the [[zodiac]] and the [[Heliocentric orbit|solar]] and [[lunar orbit]]s, and a [[Pointer (computing WIMP)|pointer]] in the shape of the [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]] which travelled across the top of a [[gate]]way, moved by a hidden [[cart]] and causing automatic doors to open, each revealing a [[mannequin]], every hour.&lt;ref&gt;Howard R.

It was possible to re-program the length of [[Daytime (astronomy)|day]] and night every day in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year, and it also featured five musician [[Automaton|automata]] who automatically played music when moved by [[lever]]s operated by a hidden [[camshaft]] attached to a [[water wheel]].&lt;ref name="Ancient Discoveries"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ancient Discoveries, Episode 11: Ancient Robots|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxjbaQl0ad8|accessdate=6 September 2008|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other components of the castle clock included a main reservoir with a float, a [[float chamber]] and [[Regulator (automatic control)|flow regulator]], plate and [[valve]] trough, two [[pulley]]s, crescent disc displaying the zodiac, and two falcon automata dropping balls into vases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgjrAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Al-Jazari's+castle+clock&amp;dq=Al-Jazari's+castle+clock&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=roS5UuLkFYXziAemi4GYCg&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA|title=Mughal and other Indian paintings from the Chester Beatty Library|work=''google.com.my''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strasbourg ===
{{Main article|Strasbourg astronomical clock}}
[[File:Cathedrale de Strasbourg - Horloge Astronomique.jpg|thumb|[[Strasbourg astronomical clock]]]]

The [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] has housed three different astronomical clocks since the 14th century.
The first clock was built between 1352 and 1354 and stopped working sometime at the beginning of the 16th century. A second clock was then built by Herlin, [[Conrad Dasypodius]], the Habrecht brothers, and others, between 1547 and 1574. This clock stopped working in 1788 or 1789 (as it apparently stopped working gradually, each component being disconnected
one after the other).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} After a lapse of 50 years, a new clock was built by [[Jean-Baptiste Schwilgué]] (1776–1856) and about 30 workers. This clock is housed
in the case of the 2nd clock. It shows many astronomical and calendrical functions (including what is thought to be the first complete mechanization of the part of the [[computus]] needed to compute Easter) as well as several automata.

[[File:PragueTownHallClock.jpg|thumb|left|[[Prague Astronomical Clock]]]]

=== Prague ===
{{Main article|Prague astronomical clock}}
:''See that article for an annotated diagram of its functions.''
One of the most famous of this type of clock is the Old-Town Hall clock in [[Prague, Czech Republic]]. It is also known as the [[Prague astronomical clock|Prague orloj]]. The central portion was completed in 1410. The four figures are set in motion at the hour, with Death (represented by a skeleton) striking the time. On the hour there is a presentation of statues of the [[Twelve apostles|Apostles]] at the doorways above the clock, with all twelve presented at noon. In 1490 a calendar display was added below the clock along with decorative Gothic sculptures.

During [[World War II]] the clock was nearly destroyed by [[Nazism|Nazi]] fire. The townspeople are credited with heroic efforts in saving most of the parts. It was gradually renovated until 1948. In 1979 the clock was once more cleaned and renovated. According to local legend the city will suffer if the clock is neglected and its good operation is placed in jeopardy.

=== Olomouc ===
[[File:Olomouc Astronomical Clock.jpg|thumb|Olomouc astronomical clock detail]]{{Main|Olomouc astronomical clock}}
[[Olomouc]], the former capital of [[Moravia]] in the eastern part of the Czech Republic, also has an impressive exterior astronomical clock on the main town square. It is a rare example of a [[heliocentric system|heliocentric]] astronomical clock.

A legend dates its construction to the year 1422; however, in historic sources it is first mentioned in 1517. The clock was remodelled approximately once every century; in 1898 the astrolabe was replaced with a heliocentric model of the solar system. When the retreating [[Nazi German army]] passed through Olomouc in the final days of the war in May 1945, they opened fire on the old astronomical clock, leaving only a few pieces (that can now be seen in the local museum). As a result of the serious damage the clock was reconstructed in the style of [[socialist-realism]] in the first years of [[communist rule in Czechoslovakia]] (1948-early 1950s). The religious and royal figures were replaced with athletes, workers, farmers, scientists and other members of the proletariat, while the [[glockenspiel]] was altered to play three pieces of traditional local music.

=== Stará Bystrica ===
[[File:Stará Bystrica1.jpg|thumb|[[Stará Bystrica]] astronomical clock]]

In 2009 an astronomical clock was built in the municipality of [[Stará Bystrica]] in Northern [[Slovakia]] during the reconstruction of the town square.

The astronomical clock has the shape of a stylized form of [[Our Lady of Sorrows]], patron of Slovakia; it has been described as the largest wooden statue of Slovakia. Its exterior is decorated by statues of important figures from Slovakia's history: Prince [[Pribina]], King [[Svatopluk I|Svatopluk]], [[Anton Bernolák]], [[Ľudovít Štúr]], [[Milan Rastislav Štefánik]], [[Andrej Hlinka]]. Each hour, statuettes of saints connected with Slovakia appear: [[Cyril and Methodius|Cyril, Methodius]], [[Andrew Zorard|Andrew-Zorard]], [[Benedict of Szkalka|Benedict]], [[Gorazd]], [[Bystrík]] and [[Adalbert of Prague|Adalbert]]. The bells of the clock carry the names Sv. Juraj ([[St. George]]) and Riečnická Madona (Our Lady of Riečnica); the first is rung to indicate the time, the second accompanies the saints. This astronomical clock is the only one in Slovakia.

The astronomical part of the clock consists of an [[astrolabe]] displaying the astrological signs, positions of the Sun and Moon, and the lunar phases. The clock is controlled by computer using [[DCF77]] signals.&lt;ref name="Slovak_clock"&gt;[http://www.starabystrica.sk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=204&amp;Itemid=70 Slovenský orloj v Starej Bystrici] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210112729/http://www.starabystrica.sk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=204&amp;Itemid=70 |date=10 December 2013 }}, municipality official website (in Slovak)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orloj.eu/cs/orloje_2.htm Pražský orloj – Orloje v zahraničí] (Prague Astronomical Clock – Foreign clocks, in Czech)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lunddomirkeur2.jpg|thumb|Astronomical clock in [[Lund Cathedral]]]]

=== Lund ===
The astronomical clock in [[Lund Cathedral]] in Sweden, ''[[Horologium mirabile Lundense]]'' was made around 1425, probably by the clockmaker Nicolaus Lilienveld in Rostock. After it had been in storage since 1837, it was restored and put back in place in 1923. Only the upper, astronomical part is original, while some of the other remaining medieval parts can be seen at the Cathedral museum. When it plays, one can hear ''[[In Dulci Jubilo]]'' from the smallest organ in the church, while seven wooden figures, representing the three [[magi]] and their servants, pass by.

=== Besançon, France ===
Made in 1860 by {{Interlanguage link multi|Auguste-Lucien Vérité|fr}} of [[Beauvais]], the [[Astronomical clock (Besançon)]] expresses the theological concept that during each second of the day the Resurrection of Christ transforms the existence of man and of the world. The clock stands 5.8 metres high and 2.5 metres wide, and has 30,000 mechanical parts. Seventy dials provide 122 indications including seconds, hours, days and years. The clock is perpetual and can register up to 10,000 years, including adjustments for leap year cycles. Immediately after he finished the Besançon commission, Vérité built a larger more elaborate clock for [[Beauvais Cathedral]] in his home town.

=== Beauvais, France ===
[[Beauvais astronomical clock]] in [[Beauvais Cathedral]] was built by Auguste-Lucien Vérité over a period of four years, from 1865 to 1868 as a follow-up to his elaborate clock at [[Besancon]]. It is 12 metres high, 6 metres wide, and contains over 90,000 individual parts. It has 52 dials that display the times of sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset, the phases of the moon, the solstices, the position of the planets, the current time in 18 cities around the world, and the tidal hours. The clock has a case that blends [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] styles and is crowned by a multi-tiered Celestial City with 68 [[automata]] that animate, at the striking of each hour, to enact the [[Last Judgement]].

=== Copenhagen ===
The [[Copenhagen City Hall|city hall]] in Copenhagen has a complete [[Jens Olsen's World Clock|astronomical clock]], set in an interior glass cabinet.
The clock was designed over a period of 50 years by amateur astronomer and professional clockmaker [[Jens Olsen]].
Some of the components (such as the computus) were inspired by the Strasbourg clock, which was studied
by Olsen. It was assembled from 1948 to 1955. Between 1995 and 1997 the clock underwent a complete restoration by the Danish watchmaker and conservator Søren Andersen.

=== The Rasmus Sørnes Clock ===
[[File:RasmusSornesClock.jpg|thumb|left|The Rasmus Sørnes Clock.]]

Arguably the most complicated of its kind ever constructed, the last of a total of four astronomical clocks designed and made by Norwegian [[Rasmus Sørnes]] (1893–1967), is characterized by its superior complexity compactly housed in a casing with the modest measurements of 0.70 x 0.60 x 2.10 m. Features include locations of the sun and moon in the zodiac, [[Julian calendar]], [[Gregorian calendar]], [[sidereal time]], GMT, local time with daylight saving time and leap year, solar and lunar cycle corrections, eclipses, local sunset and sunrise, moonphase, tides, [[sunspot]] cycles and a [[planetarium]] including [[Pluto]]'s 248-year orbit and the 25 800-year period of the polar ecliptics ([[precession]] of the Earth's axis). All wheels are in brass and gold-plated. Dials are silver-plated.

Sørnes also made the necessary tools and based his work on his own observations of the firmament. This remarkable timepiece will probably be the last one ever to be designed and made by hand by one single person as true craftsmanship and a work of art. The result, outstanding for its performance and accuracy, remains a symbol of the transition from the mechanical age, Sørnes' electromechanical pendulum system pointing forward into the age of digital clocks. Having been exhibited at the Time Museum in Rockford, Illinois, and at The Chicago Museum of Science and Industry, the clock was sold in 2002 and its current location is not known. The Rasmus Sørnes Astronomical Clock no.3, the precursor to the Chicago Clock, his tools, patents, drawings, telescope and other items, are exhibited at the [[Borgarsyssel Museum]] in [[Sarpsborg]], Norway.

=== Table clocks ===
There are many examples of astronomical table clocks, due to their popularity as showpieces. To become a master clockmaker in 17th century Augsburg candidates had to design and build a 'masterpiece' clock, an astronomical table top clock of formidable complexity. Examples can be found in museums, such as London's [[British Museum]].

Currently Edmund Scientific among other retailers offer a mechanical Tellurium clock, perhaps the first mechanical astronomical clock to be mass marketed.

In Japan, [[Tanaka Hisashige]] made [[Myriad year clock]] in 1851.

== Generic description ==
Although each astronomical clock is different, they share some common features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burnett-Stuart|first=George|title=Astronomical Clocks of the Middle Ages: A guided tour|work=Almagest|publisher=Computastat Group, Ltd.|url=http://www.almagest.co.uk/middle/astclk.htm|accessdate=24 April 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080402123301/http://www.almagest.co.uk/middle/astclk.htm| archivedate= 2 April 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Time of day ===
[[File:Astroclock-24hourdial.svg|thumb|How the [[24-hour analog dial]] might be interpreted.]]
[[File:Astroclock-zodiac.png|thumb|Diagram showing how the [[zodiac]] is projected on to the ecliptic dial – the symbols are often drawn inside the dial.]]
[[File:Astroclock-stereographic.png|thumb|[[Stereographic projection]] from the North pole.]]

Most astronomical clocks have a [[24-hour analog dial]] around the outside edge, numbered from I to XII then from I to XII again. The current time is indicated by a golden ball or a picture of the sun at the end of a pointer. Local noon is usually at the top of the dial, and midnight at the bottom. Minute hands are rarely used.

The sun indicator or hand gives an approximate indication of both the sun's [[azimuth]] and altitude. For azimuth (bearing from North), the top of the dial indicates South, and the two VI points of the dial East and West. For altitude, the top is the zenith and the two VI and VI points define the horizon. (This is for the astronomical clocks designed for use in the northern hemisphere.) This interpretation is most accurate at the equinoxes, of course.

If XII is not at the top of the dial, or if the numbers are Arabic rather than Roman, then the time may be shown in [[Hour#Counting from sunset|Italian hours]] (also called Bohemian, or Old Czech, hours). In this system, 1 o'clock occurs at sunset, and counting continues through the night and into the next afternoon, reaching 24 an hour before sunset.

In the photograph of the Prague clock shown above, the time indicated by the sun hand is about noon (XII in Roman numerals), or about the 17th hour (Italian time in Arabic numerals).

=== Calendar and zodiac ===
The year is usually represented by the 12 signs of the [[zodiac]], arranged either as a concentric circle inside the 24-hour dial, or drawn onto a displaced smaller circle, which is a projection of the [[ecliptic]], the path of the sun and planets through the sky, and the plane of the Earth's orbit.

The ecliptic plane is projected onto the face of the clock, and, because of the Earth's tilted angle of rotation relative to its orbital plane, it is displaced from the center and appears to be distorted. The projection point for the [[stereographic projection]] is the North pole; on [[astrolabes]] the South pole is more common.

The ecliptic dial makes one complete revolution in 23 hours 56 minutes (a [[sidereal time|sidereal day]]), and will therefore gradually get out of phase with the hour hand, drifting slowly further apart during the year.

To find the date, find the place where the hour hand or sun disk intersects the ecliptic dial: this indicates the current star sign, the sun's current location on the ecliptic. The intersection point slowly moves round the ecliptic dial during the year, as the sun moves out of one [[astrological sign]] into another.

In the photograph of the Prague clock shown above, the sun's disk has recently moved into Aries (the stylized ram's horns), having left Pisces. The date is therefore late March or early April.

If the zodiac signs run around inside the hour hands, either this ring rotates to align itself with the hour hand, or there's another hand, revolving once per year, which points to the sun's current zodiac sign.

=== Moon ===
A dial or ring indicating the numbers 1 to 29 or 30 indicates the moon's age: a new moon is 0, waxes and become full around day 15, and then wanes up to 29 or 30. The phase is sometimes shown by a rotating globe or black hemisphere, or a window that reveals part of a wavy black shape beneath.

=== Hour lines ===
Unequal hours were the result of dividing up the period of daylight into 12 equal hours, and night time into another 12. In Europe, there is more daylight in the summer, and less night, so each of the 12 daylight hours is longer than a night hour. Similarly in winter, daylight hours are shorter, and night hours are longer. These unequal hours are shown by the curved lines radiating from the center. The longer daylight hours in summer can usually be seen at the outer edge of the dial, and the time in unequal hours is read by noting the intersection of the sun hand with the appropriate curved line.

=== Aspects ===
Astrologers placed importance on how the sun, moon, and planets were arranged and aligned in the sky. If certain planets appeared at the points of a triangle, hexagon, or square, or if they were opposite or next to each other, the appropriate [[astrological aspect|aspect]] was used to determine the event's significance. On some clocks you can see the common aspects—triangle, square, and hexagon—drawn inside the central disk, with each line marked by the symbol for that aspect, and you may also see the signs for conjunction and opposition. On an astrolabe, the corners of the different aspects could be lined up on any of the planets. On a clock, though, the disk containing the aspect lines can't be rotated at will, so they usually show only the aspects of the sun or moon.

In the photograph of the Brescia clock above, the triangle, square, and star in the center of the dial show these aspects (the third, fourth, and sixth phases) of (presumably) the moon.

=== Dragon hand: eclipse prediction and lunar nodes ===
The moon's orbit is not in the same plane as the Earth's orbit around the sun, but crosses it in two places. The moon crosses the ecliptic plane twice a month, once when it goes up above the plane, and again 15 or so days later when it goes back down below the ecliptic. These two locations are the ascending and descending [[lunar nodes]]. Solar and lunar eclipses will occur only when the moon is positioned near one of these nodes, because at other times the moon is either too high or too low for an eclipse to be noticed from earth. Some astronomical clocks keep track of the position of the lunar nodes with a long pointer that crosses the dial. This so-called dragon hand makes one complete rotation around the ecliptic dial every 19 years. When the dragon hand and the new moon coincide, the moon is on the same plane as the earth and sun, and so there is every chance that an eclipse will be visible from somewhere on earth.

The '''Axiom of Cumulative Inertia''' is a sociological phenomenon rooted in observations of [[Human migration|human migratory patterns]]. Introduced in 1966 by Myers, McGinnis and Masnick,&lt;ref&gt;George C. Myers , Robert McGinnis &amp; George Masnick, [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19485565.1967.9987711 "The duration of residence approach to a dynamic stochastic model of internal migration: A test of the axiom of cumulative inertia"], ''Eugenics Quarterly'', 1967. Retrieved 31/03/2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the most widely known form of the axiom is encapsulated by the statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The probability of remaining in any state of nature increases as a strict monotone function of duration of prior residence in that state."&lt;ref&gt;Robert McGinnis, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2092882 "A Stochastic Model of Social Mobility"], ''American Sociological Review'', 1968. Retrieved 31/03/2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
There is thus a clear [[Negative relationship|negative correlation]] between the amount of time a person has lived in a certain location, and the likelihood they will move in future.&lt;ref&gt;Burton Singer and Seymour Spilerman, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/270841 "Social Mobility Models for Heterogeneous Populations"], ''Sociological Methodology'', 1973-4. Retrieved 31/03/2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Suggested reasons for this change include [[loss aversion]] (resulting from possible unknown problems in the further place of residence), financial stability linked to a certain place of employment or the presence of an extended social network in the form of familial and other obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Philip S. Morrison and W.A.V. Clark, [http://papers.ccpr.ucla.edu/papers/PWP-CCPR-2015-006/PWP-CCPR-2015-006.pdf "Why do they stay? Loss aversion and Duration of Residence"], ''California Center for Population Research, UCLA'', 2015. Retrieved 31/03/2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
The large number of factors which affect human migratory patterns make it difficult to assess the exact degree of impact of the various postulated variables, and debate also exists as to the appropriate relation between residence time and likelihood of moving.

Since it was first coined from human residence patterns, cumulative inertia has since been observed in a variety of other social behaviours. It has been used to model entry to and recovery from [[addiction]], modern [[tribalism]] effects, and the [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] chances of repeat offenders ([[recidivism]]). Identifying the role and strength of inertia in such behaviours can be critical in designing the appropriate treatment or intervention strategy, and is an important tool in identifying individuals or groups which are most likely to change behaviour. 

In addition to being relevant in specific demographic targeting, such as members of a political party who are more likely to be swayed by different ideology, or individuals who pose a higher risk of relapsing into additive behaviours, cumulative inertia can also play an important role outside of [[Political campaign|political campaigns]] or [[public policy]] making. Geographical areas presenting strong cumulative inertia are indicative of attractive regions wherein [[Real estate economics|property prices]] or demand is likely to rise&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fedotov|first=Sergei|last2=Stage|first2=Helena|date=2017-03-03|title=Anomalous Metapopulation Dynamics on Scale-Free Networks|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.098301|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=118|issue=9|pages=098301|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.098301|arxiv=1610.02433}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Cumulative inertia can thus also have a strong financial impact.

The study of cumulative inertia remains an active area of current research in [[Complex system|complex systems]] or quantitative [[sociology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6356">The '''Centre of Research in Theories and Practices that Overcome Inequalities''' ('''CREA''') was founded in 1991 by a current professor of [[Sociology]] at the [[University of Barcelona]], [[Doctor Honoris Causa]] of [[West University of Timisoara]] and also a recognized researcher in [[Europe]] in the [[Social Science]] area, [[Ramon Flecha]]. After Ramon Flecha’s resignation as the Director of CREA, in 2006; Marta Soler, Doctor by Harvard, a current Professor of Sociological Theory, assumed the post. 
CREA, one of the centres that first joined the Scientific Park of Barcelona (University of Barcelona); is indisciplinary;  [[multicultural]]  and open accepting different [[ideology|ideologies]], [[religion]]s, [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]], [[sexual orientation]]s ; transparent, since its knowledge is at everyone’s disposal; and it is a centre where the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of [[argument]]s prevails over the positions of power of their members, creating, in this way, an environment of an [[egalitarian dialogue]]. This centre is formed by University [[research]] professors, researchers and professional collaborators of diverse disciplines (sociology, pedagogy, economy, mathematics, communication, biology, etc.).

==Methodology==
All the [[research]] CREA carries out is done with the direct collaboration of the subjects researched, using the [[critical communicative methodology]]. The subject of research is directly included providing its interpretations, experiences and opinions, enriching, in this way, the research. It is about facilitating the participation of the researched in the research through an [[egalitarian dialogue]] with the researcher where [[Validity (logic)|validity]] claims prevail over [[Power (philosophy)|power]] ones.

==Lines of research==
The [[Research]] Centre carries out both, international and national projects developing the following lines of research:

* [[Dialogic]] Theories (including the Critical Communicative Research [[Methodology]] and [[Speech]] Acts, [[Social]] uses of the information and [[Communication]] technologies).
* [[Cultural]] Groups ([[Romani people|Roma]], [[Arab]]- [[Muslim]] and [[Jewish community]]) and [[human migration|migration]]
* [[Learning]] Communities
* [[Gender]] (Gender [[Violence]])
* [[Governance]] and Active [[Citizenship]]

==Groups==
And from the lines of research described above, five groups were created by CREA:
*	[[Romani people|Roma]] Studies Group
*	[[Jewish Studies]] Group
*	Alhiwar [[Arab]]-[[Muslim]] Group
*	Interreligious [[Dialogue]]
*	SAFO CREA [[Women]]’s Group

==International dimension==
CREA is, today, internationally well- known for its international research oriented to overcoming inequalities; already present in Europe and in various countries such as [[Brazil]], [[United States]], [[Korea]] or [[Australia]].
Concretely, from its origins, CREA has collaborated with international research groups, as well as with different authors of the Scientific International Community. Some of the seminars were held with important authors such as: [[Paulo Freire]] (1994), [[Ulrich Beck]] and Elisabeth Beck Gernsheim(1998), [[Alain Touraine]] (1999), [[Jon Elster]] (2001), [[Judith Butler]] ( 2001), [[Alejandro Portes]] (2002), Gordon Wells(2003), [[John Searle]] (2003) or [[Gary Orfield]] (2003).

Different members of CREA have given lectures and seminars at several universities in [[Brazil]], [[United States]], [[Germany]], Australia, [[Korea]] and others. [[Ramon Flecha]] participated in The [[Harvard]] Education Forum celebrated on February 27, 1998; in honor of [[Paulo Freire]], alongside important international referents such as: [[Noam Chomsky]] (Institute Professor and Professor of Linguistics, [[MIT]]), Eileen de los Reyes (Moderator, Assistant Professor [[Harvard Graduate School of Education|HGSE]]), Carolyn Higgins (Earlhm College), Yamila Hussein ([[Harvard Graduate School of Education|HGSE]] master’s degree candidate), [[Donaldo Macedo]] ([[UMass Boston]]), Nancy Richardson (associate dean for ministry, [[Harvard Divinity School]]), [[Ira Shor]] ([[City College of New York]]).

In addition, and as another example, in 2008, professor of Sociological Theory and director of CREA, Marta Soler, gave two lectures about literary gatherings and Community involvement for [[social change]]  and about the role of critical communicative methodology in Overcoming [[social exclusion]] ; and led a seminar at the Havens Center for Study of Social of Structure and Social Change, in the [[University of Wisconsin- Madison]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3403">A '''collective action clause''' (CAC) allows a [[supermajority]] of [[Bond (finance)|bondholders]] to agree to a [[debt restructuring]] that is legally binding on all holders of the bond, including those who vote against the restructuring. Bondholders generally opposed such clauses in the 1980s and 1990s, fearing that it gave debtors too much power. However, following [[Argentina]]'s December 2001 default on its debts in which its bonds lost 70% of their value, CACs have become much more common, as they are now seen as potentially warding off more drastic action, but enabling easier coordination of bondholders.

During the financial crisis of 2011-12, the Greek government imposed, with the support of the [[IMF]] and [[European Central Bank|ECB]], a retroactive CAC with a threshold of 75%.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20120109-710447.html WSJ.com: "2nd UPDATE: Greece To Introduce Retroactive Collective Action Clauses-Source" 9 Jan 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; That impacted 90% of the bonds, which issued under the jurisdiction of Greek courts.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; On 9 May 2012, the required supermajority was obtained, with 85.8% of domestic-law bonds tendered in favour.&lt;ref name=bbg9may&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-09/greece-debt-swap-tops-95-level-to-trigger-forced-bondholder-participation.html bloomberg.com: "Greece Pushes Bondholders Into Record Debt Swap" 9 Mar 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; An investor named [[Bill H.

In accordance with the treaty establishing the [[European Stability Mechanism]], all bonds issued by [[Eurozone]] member states with maturities exceeding one year, issued after January 1, 2013, have a mandatory collective action clause. &lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/efc/sub_committee/cac/index_en.htm Collective Action Clauses in Euro area] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811165017/http://europa.eu/efc/sub_committee/cac/index_en.htm |date=2014-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cystolith''' (Gr. "cavity" and "stone") is a [[botanical]] term for outgrowths of the epidermal [[cell wall]], usually of [[calcium carbonate]], formed in a [[cellulose]] matrix in special [[cell (biology)|cell]]s called lithocysts, generally in the [[leaf]] of [[plant]]s. 

Cystoliths are present in certain [[Family (biology)|families]], including in many [[Genus|genera]] of [[Acanthaceae]]. Plants in the family [[Urticaceae]], known as [[stinging nettle]]s, also form leaf cystoliths, but only during their later flowering and seed setting stages. Other examples include [[Cannabis]] and other plants in the family [[Cannabaceae]], which produce leaf and flower cystoliths, and ''[[Ficus elastica]]'', the Indian rubber plant of the family [[Moraceae]]. 

From a 1987 article on cystolith development and structure:

{{blockquote|... The cystolith is a spindle-shaped body composed of concentric layers of longitudinally oriented cellulose [[microfibril]]s associated with [[pectin]]s and other cell wall polysaccharides. At maturity it is heavily impregnated with calcium carbonate. Some cystoliths also contain silicon and are covered in a sheath of siliceous material. Cystolith formation occurs at the tip of a peg that grows in from the lithocyst wall. Evidence from ultrastructure suggests that the lithocyst cytoplasm transports carbohydrates to the cystolith via [[Golgi apparatus#Structure|Golgi vesicle]]s, and organizes the deposition of cystolith cellulose microfibrils via a system of [[microtubule]]s lying beneath the plasma membrane that envelopes the growing cystolith. The peg is composed of heavily staining amorphous material like that of an apoplastically sealed cell wall. It is incapable of supporting the migration of lanthanum ions into the cystolith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Watt, W.M.|author2=Morrell, C.K.|author3=Smith, D.L.|author4=Steer, M.W.|year=1987|title=Cystolith development and structure in Pilea cadierei (Urticaceae)|journal=Annals of Botany|volume=60|issue=1|pages=71–84|url=http://academic.oup.com/aob/article-abstract/60/1/71/251264/Cystolith-Development-and-Structure-in-Pilea}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Data-informed decision-making (DIDM)''' gives reference to the [[data collection|collection]] and [[data analysis|analysis]] of [[data]] to guide [[decision-making|decisions]] that improve success.&lt;ref name="ED504191"&gt;U.S. Department of Education Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development (2009). ''Implementing data-informed decision making in schools: Teacher access, supports and use.'' United States Department of Education (ERIC Document Reproduction Service No. ED504191)&lt;/ref&gt; DIDM is used in [[education]] communities (where data is used with the goal of helping [[student]]s and improving curricula) but is also applicable to (and thus also used in) other fields in which data is used to inform decisions. While [[data based decision making]] is a more common term, ''data-informed'' decision-making is a preferable term since decisions should not be based solely on [[quantitative data]].&lt;ref name="ED504191"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, M. S., Swinnerton, J. A., Copland, M. A., &amp; Monpas-Hubar, J. (2006). ''Data-informed leadership in education.'' Seattle, WA: Center for the Study of Teaching and Policy.&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[educator]]s have access to a [[data system]] for the purpose of analyzing student data.&lt;ref&gt;Aarons, D. (2009). [http://search.proquest.com/docview/202710770?accountid=28180   Report finds states on course to build pupil-data systems.] ''Education Week, 29''(13), 6.&lt;/ref&gt; These data systems present data to educators in an over-the-counter data format (embedding labels, supplemental documentation, and a help system, making key package/display and content decisions) to improve the success of educators’ data-informed decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, J. (2013, March 28). [https://sas.elluminate.com/site/external/recording/playback/link/table/dropin?sid=2008350&amp;suid=D.4DF60C7117D5A77FE3AED546909ED2 How data Systems &amp; reports can either fight or propagate the data analysis error epidemic, and how educator leaders can help.] ''Presentation conducted from Technology Information Center for Administrative Leadership (TICAL) School Leadership Summit.''&lt;/ref&gt; In Business, fostering and actively supporting DIDM in their firm and among their colleagues could be the main rôle of CIOs (Chief Information Officers) or CDOs (Chief Data Officers).&lt;ref&gt;Delort P. 2012. [http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/Session_3_Delort.pdf#page=13 ICCP Technology Foresight Forum - "Harnessing data as a new source of growth: Big data analytics and policies" .] ''OECD, 2012''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Assessment in higher education]] is a form of DIDM aimed at using evidence of what students learn to improve curriculum, student learning, and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flaherty|first1=Colleen|title=Large-Scale Assessment Without Standardized Tests|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/02/23/aacu-releases-report-national-large-scale-look-student-learning)|website=Inside HigherEd|accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standardized tests, grades, and student work scored by rubrics are forms of student learning outcomes assessment. There are numerous organizations aimed at promoting the assessment of student learning through DIDM including the National Institute for Learning Outcomes Assessment, the Association for the Assessment of Student Learning in Higher Education, and, to an extent, the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]].

Similarly, the idea of data-informed decision making is becoming more prevalent within [[international development]] is similarly being emphasized. For instance, in a literature review focused on development, an integrated, participatory, structured and enpowering approach to using evidence and data in decision-making to inform development decisions was tied to improved results. &lt;ref&gt;[https://usaidlearninglab.org//lab-notes/cracking-evidence-conundrum-four-ideas-get-people-use-evidence "Cracking the Evidence Conundrum: Four Ideas to Get People to Use Evidence"] (18 December 2017).

==Biography==
[[File:Illustration of a Caiman crocodilus and an Anilius scytale (1701–1705) by Maria Sibylla Merian.jpg|thumb|Her works are hard to tell apart from her sister's and mother's work, but [[Sam Segal]] has reattributed 30 of 91 folios in the [[British Museum]] to her]]
Dorothea Maria Graff was born in [[Nuremberg]] as the daughter of the painters [[Maria Sibylla Merian]] and [[Johann Andreas Graff]], and learned to paint from them and her sister [[Johanna Helena Herolt]] who was ten years older.&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;Dorothea Maria Graff in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1681 her mother returned to Frankfurt without her father, in order to live with her mother after her stepfather [[Jacob Marrel]]'s death.&lt;ref name=DVN&gt;[http://www.historici.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/DVN/lemmata/data/GraffDorothea Dorothea Maria Graff] in the Instituut voor Nederlandse Geschiedenis&lt;/ref&gt; Though Johann Graff joined his family later, in 1686 Merian left her husband and moved with her two daughters and her mother to a religious community of [[Labadist]]s in [[Wieuwerd]], Friesland.&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt; Johann Graff made various attempts at reconciliation but eventually returned to Germany.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt; In 1691 the four women moved to [[Amsterdam]], where they set up a studio painting flowers and botanical subjects, continuing Merian's work on "The Caterpillar Book".&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt; In 1699 Dorothea accompanied her mother to [[Surinam]] and they returned in September 1701.

She married a surgeon from Heidelberg, Philip Hendriks, a few months later on 2 December 1701.&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt; Dorothea moved in with her mother where they ran a business selling her mother's prints and paintings.&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt; The couple had a child who died young.&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt; Johanna moved with her husband to [[Surinam]] in 1711 and in the same year Dorothea's husband died and Dorothea took on her mother's name Merian, possibly for business reasons.&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt; In 1713 mother and daughter published ''Der rupsen begin, voedsel en wonderbaare veranderingen'', followed by the second volume in 1714. Though her daughters are not mentioned by name, both Johanna and Dorothea probably contributed to the plates. In 1714 mother Maria had a stroke that partially paralysed her and Johanna returned for a visit from Surinam, painting under her mother's name and working on volume three. In 1715 Dorothea remarried, this time to the widowed Swiss painter [[Georg Gsell]], who had recently divorced his second wife and had previously lodged with Dorothea and her mother. Gsell had been living in Amsterdam since 1704 and had five daughters from his first marriage, including Katharina, the later wife of the mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]].&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt; From Surinam, Johanna continued to supply her sister with insects and other supplies.

In 1717, after her mother died in January, Dorothea published the third volume of her mother's ''Der Rupsen Begin''.&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt; Works by the house of Merian were purchased by [[Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach]], [[Pieter Teyler van der Hulst]], and [[Robert Areskin]]. Pieter the Great asked the Gsell-Merian couple to come work for him, and they did, first selling all of mother Maria's work that they could. In October 1717 Georg Gsell became court painter in [[Saint Petersburg]] and Dorothea became a teacher at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Petrus Academie of Science]], and curator of the natural history collection [[Kunstkamera]] (which included her own work). In 1736 she returned to Amsterdam to purchase works by her mother for the collection. She died in Saint Petersburg.&lt;ref name=DVN/&gt;

The intention of the ECCC is to provide a fast publication service intermediate in its level of [[peer review]] between preprint servers such as authors' web sites or [[arXiv]] (which release papers with little or no delay and filtering) and journals (which subject papers to a heavy editing process but, in computer science, may take months or years to publish a paper). Papers submitted to ECCC are screened by a board of experts, who review the submissions to ensure that they are on-topic, novel, interesting, and written according to the standards of the field. Any panelist may accept or reject any of the submissions; if no decision is made within two months, the submission is automatically rejected.&lt;ref name="bdm97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bms98"/&gt;

In order to ensure the long-term stability of the archive, its contents are backed up by electronic media that are sent to multiple libraries and to the ECCC board members and by printouts that are stored in multiple locations.&lt;ref name="mk06"/&gt;
Works in the ECCC remain the copyright of the authors, who may request their removal at any time.&lt;ref name="bdm97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bms98"/&gt;

The ECCC was founded in 1994 at the [[University of Trier]] in [[Trier, Germany]]. In 2004 its founding editor [[Christoph Meinel]] moved to the [[Hasso Plattner Institute]] at the [[University of Potsdam]] and moved some of the ECCC offices with him to Potsdam. In January 2017 the ECCC moved to the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/ |title=ECCC relocated to Weizmann Institute |last=Goldreich |first=Oded |date=2017-05-01 |work=[ECCC/News] |access-date= |via= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105184704/https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/ |archivedate=2017-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first ten years of the project, it had accepted more than 900 papers, and had nearly 500 registered users.&lt;ref name="mk06"/&gt;

The '''elementary effects (EE) method''' is the most used{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} screening method in [[sensitivity analysis]]. It is applied to identify non-influential inputs for a computationally costly [[mathematical model]] or for a model with a large number of inputs, where the costs of estimating other sensitivity analysis measures such as the variance-based measures is not affordable. Like all screening, the EE method provides qualitative sensitivity analysis measures, i.e. measures which allow the identification of non-influential inputs or which allow to rank the input factors in order of importance, but do not quantify exactly the relative importance of the inputs.

==Methodology==

To exemplify the EE method, let us assume to consider a mathematical model with &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; input factors. Let &lt;math&gt; Y &lt;/math&gt; be the output of interest (a scalar for simplicity):

: &lt;math&gt; Y = f(X_1, X_2, ... X_k).&lt;/math&gt;

The original EE method of Morris &lt;ref&gt;Morris, M. D. (1991). Factorial sampling plans for preliminary computational experiments. ''Technometrics'', '''33''', 161–174.&lt;/ref&gt; provides two sensitivity measures for each input factor:

* the measure &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;, assessing the overall importance of an input factor on the model output;
* the measure &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;, describing non-linear effects and interactions.

These two measures are obtained through a design based on the construction of a series of trajectories in the space of the inputs, where inputs are randomly moved One-At-a-Time (OAT).
In this design, each model input is assumed to vary across &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; selected levels in the space of the input factors. The region of experimentation &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is thus a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-level grid.

Each trajectory is composed of &lt;math&gt;(k+1)&lt;/math&gt; points since input factors move one by one of a step &lt;math&gt; \Delta &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\{0, 1/(p-1), 2/(p-1),..., 1\}&lt;/math&gt; while all the others remain fixed.

Along each trajectory the so-called ''elementary effect'' for each input factor is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt; d_i(X) = \frac{Y(X_1, \ldots ,X_{i-1}, X_i + \Delta, X_{i+1}, \ldots, X_k ) - Y( \mathbf X)}{\Delta} &lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{X} = (X_1, X_2, ... X_k)&lt;/math&gt; is any selected value in &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; such that the transformed point is still in &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; for each index &lt;math&gt; i=1,\ldots, k. &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; elementary effects are estimated for each input &lt;math&gt; d_i\left(X^{(1)} \right), d_i\left( X^{(2)} \right), \ldots, d_i\left( X^{(r)} \right) &lt;/math&gt; by randomly sampling &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; points &lt;math&gt; X^{(1)}, X^{(2)}, \ldots , X^{(r)}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Usually &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; ~ 4-10, depending on the number of input factors, on the computational cost of the model and on the choice of the number of levels &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt;, since a high number of levels to be explored needs to be balanced by a high number of trajectories, in order to obtain an exploratory sample. It is demonstrated that a convenient choice for the parameters &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Delta &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; even and &lt;math&gt; \Delta &lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;
p/[2(p-1)]&lt;/math&gt;, as this ensures equal probability of sampling in the input space.

In case input factors are not uniformly distributed, the best practice is to sample in the space of the quantiles and to obtain the inputs values using inverse cumulative distribution functions. Note that in this case &lt;math&gt; \Delta &lt;/math&gt; equals the step taken by the inputs in the space of the quantiles.

The two measures &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; are defined as the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution of the elementary effects of each input:&lt;br /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \mu_i = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{j=1}^r d_i \left( X^{(j)} \right) &lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt; \sigma_i = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{(r-1)} \sum_{j=1}^r \left( d_i \left( X^{(j)} \right) - \mu_i \right)^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

These two measures need to be read together (e.g. on a two-dimensional graph) in order to rank input factors in order of importance and identify those inputs which do not influence the output variability. Low values of both &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; correspond to a non-influent input.

An improvement of this method was developed by Campolongo et al.&lt;ref&gt;Campolongo, F., J. Cariboni, and A. Saltelli (2007). An effective screening design for sensitivity analysis of large models. ''Environmental Modelling and Software'', '''22''',
1509&amp;ndash;1518.&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed a revised measure &lt;math&gt; \mu^* &lt;/math&gt;, which on its own is sufficient to provide a reliable ranking of the input factors. The revised measure is the mean of the distribution of the absolute values of the elementary effects of the input factors:&lt;br /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \mu_i^* = \frac{1}{r} \sum_{j=1}^r \left| d_i \left( X^{(j)} \right) \right| &lt;/math&gt;.
The use of &lt;math&gt; \mu^* &lt;/math&gt; solves the problem of the effects of opposite signs which occurs when the model is non-monotonic and which can cancel each other out, thus resulting in a low value for &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt;.

An efficient technical scheme to construct the trajectories used in the EE method is presented in the original paper by Morris while an improvement strategy aimed at better exploring the input space is proposed by Campolongo et al..

{{Anthropology |methods}}

In [[anthropology]], [[folkloristics]], and the [[social sciences|social]] and [[behavioral sciences]], '''emic''' and '''etic''' refer to two kinds of [[field research]] done and viewpoints obtained:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.sil.org/~headlandt/ee-intro.htm |title=EE intro |publisher=SIL}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''emic,'' from within the [[social group]] (from the perspective of the subject) and ''etic,'' from outside (from the perspective of the observer).

==Definitions==
"The emic approach investigates how local people think" (Kottak, 2006): How they perceive and categorize the world, their rules for behavior, what has meaning for them, and how they imagine and explain things. "The etic (scientist-oriented) approach shifts the focus from local observations, categories, explanations, and interpretations to those of the anthropologist.  The etic approach realizes that members of a culture often are too involved in what they are doing..... to interpret their cultures impartially. When using the etic approach, the [[ethnographer]] emphasizes what he or she considers important."&lt;ref&gt;Kottak, Conrad (2006). ''Mirror for Humanity'', p. 47. McGraw-Hill, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-07-803490-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although emics and etics are sometimes regarded as inherently in conflict and one can be preferred to the exclusion of the other, the complementarity of emic and etic approaches to anthropological research has been widely recognized, especially in the areas of interest concerning the characteristics of human nature as well as the form and function of human social systems.&lt;ref&gt;Jingfeng, Xia (2013). ''An Anthropological Emic-Etic Perspective On Open Access Practices'' Academic Search Premier.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote | …Emic knowledge and interpretations are those existing within a culture, that are ‘determined by local custom, meaning, and belief’ (Ager and Loughry, 2004: n.p.) and best described by a 'native' of the culture. Etic knowledge refers to generalizations about human behavior that are considered universally true, and commonly links cultural practices to factors of interest to the researcher, such as economic or ecological conditions, that cultural insiders may not consider very relevant (Morris et al., 1999).}}
Emic and etic approaches of understanding behavior and personality fall under the study of cultural anthropology. [[Cultural anthropology]] states that people are shaped by their cultures and their subcultures, and we must account for this in the study of personality.  One way is looking at things through an emic approach. This approach "is culture specific because it focuses on a single culture and it is understood on its own terms."  As explained below, the term "emic" originated from the specific linguistic term "phonemic", from ''[[phoneme]]'', which is a language-specific way of abstracting [[speech sound]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Friedman | first1 = Howard S | first2 = Miriam W | last2 = Schustack | title = Personality: Classic Theories and Modern Research | place = Boston | publisher = Pearson Allyn &amp; Bacon | year = 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://psychology.geckos.sis.org.cn/2011/10/using-one-or-more-examples-explain-emic-and-etic-concepts-akane/ |title=Using one or more examples explain emic &amp; etic concepts |last=Akane |publisher=SIS |place=[[China|CN]] |date=October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121203103812/http://psychology.geckos.sis.org.cn/2011/10/using-one-or-more-examples-explain-emic-and-etic-concepts-akane/ |archivedate=2012-12-03 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*An 'emic' account is a description of behavior or a belief in terms meaningful (consciously or unconsciously) to the actor; that is, an emic account comes from a person within the culture.  Almost anything from within a culture can provide an emic account.
*An 'etic' account is a description of a [[behavior]] or belief by a social analyst or scientific observer (a student or scholar of anthropology or sociology, for example), in terms that can be applied across cultures; that is, an etic account attempts to be 'culturally neutral', limiting any ethnocentric, political, and/or cultural bias or alienation by the observer.
When these two approaches are combined, the “richest” view of a culture or society can be understood. On its own, an emic approach would struggle with applying overarching values to a single culture. The etic approach is helpful in enabling researchers to see more than one aspect of one culture, and in applying observations to cultures around the world.

==History==
The terms were coined in 1954 by linguist [[Kenneth Pike]], who argued that the tools developed for describing [[linguistics|linguistic]] behaviors could be adapted to the description of any human social behavior. As Pike noted, social scientists have long debated whether their knowledge is objective or subjective.  Pike's innovation was to turn away from an [[epistemological]] debate, and turn instead to a methodological solution. ''Emic'' and ''etic'' are derived from the [[Linguistics|linguistic]] terms [[phoneme|phonemic]] and [[phonetic]] respectively, which are in turn derived from Greek roots.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, H.G. &amp; Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones. with the assistance of. Roderick McKenzie. Oxford: Clarendon Press&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of a truly objective description was discounted by Pike himself in his original work; he proposed the emic/etic dichotomy in anthropology as a way around philosophic issues about the very nature of [[objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The terms were also championed by [[anthropology|anthropologists]] [[Ward Goodenough]] and [[Marvin Harris]] with slightly different connotations from those used by Pike. Goodenough was primarily interested in understanding the culturally specific meaning of specific beliefs and practices; Harris was primarily interested in explaining human behavior.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Pike, Harris, and others have argued that cultural "insiders" and "outsiders" are equally capable of producing emic ''and'' etic accounts of their culture. Some researchers use "etic" to refer to objective or outsider accounts, and "emic" to refer to subjective or insider accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/~headlandt/ee-intro.htm|title=Thomas N. Headland: Controversies: Etic-Emic Introduction|website=Sil.org|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Mead]] was an anthropologist who studied the patterns of adolescence in Samoa. She discovered that the difficulties and the transitions that adolescents faced are culturally influenced. The hormones that are released during puberty can be defined using an etic framework, because [[adolescents]] globally have the same [[hormones]] being secreted. However, Mead concluded that how adolescents respond to these hormones is greatly influenced by their cultural norms. Through her studies, Mead found that simple classifications about behaviors and [[personality]] could not be used because peoples’ cultures influenced their behaviors in such a radical way.  Her studies helped create an emic approach of understanding behaviors and personality. Her research deduced that culture has a significant impact in shaping an individual’s personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/mead/field-sepik.html|title=Papua New Guinea: Sex and Temperament - Margaret Mead: Human Nature and the Power of Culture - Exhibitions - Library of Congress|work=loc.gov|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Jung]], a Swiss [[psychoanalyst]], is a researcher who took an etic approach in his studies. Jung studied [[mythology]], [[religion]], ancient rituals, and [[dreams]] leading him to believe that there are [[archetypes]] that can be identified and used to categorize people’s behaviors. Archetypes are universal structures of the collective unconscious that refer to the inherent way people are predisposed to perceive and process information.  The main archetypes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/personalitydevelopment/tp/archetypes.htm|title=What Are Jung's 4 Major Archetypes?|author=Kendra Cherry|work=About.com Education|accessdate=21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Jung studied were the [[persona]] (how people choose to present themselves to the world), the [[anima and animus|animus]]/ anima (part of people experiencing the world in viewing the opposite sex, that guides how they select their romantic partner), and the [[shadow]] (dark side of personalities because people have a concept of evil. Well-adjusted people must integrate both good and bad parts of themselves). Jung looked at the role of the [[mother]] and deduced that all people have mothers and see their mothers in a similar way; they offer nurture and comfort. His studies also suggest that “infants have evolved to suck milk from the breast, it is also the case that all children have inborn tendencies to react in certain ways.” This way of looking at the mother is an etic way of applying a concept cross-culturally and universally.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Importance as regards personality==
Emic and etic approaches are important to understanding personality because problems can arise “when concepts, measures, and methods are carelessly transferred to other cultures in attempts to make cross- cultural generalizations about personality.” It is hard to apply certain generalizations of behavior to people who are so diverse and culturally different. One example of this is the F-scale (Macleod).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/authoritarian-personality.html|title=Theories of Personality|work=simplypsychology.org|accessdate=21 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024113220/http://www.simplypsychology.org/authoritarian-personality.html|archivedate=24 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]], which was created by [[Theodor Adorno]], is used to measure [[Authoritarian Personality]], which can, in turn, be used to predict prejudiced behaviors. This test, when applied to Americans accurately depicts [[prejudices]] towards black individuals. However, when a study was conducted in [[South Africa]] using the F-Scale, (Pettigrew and Friedman) &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; results did not predict any anti-Black prejudices. This study used emic approaches of study by conducting interviews with the locals and etic approaches by giving participants generalized personality tests.

===Beef===
[[File:Beef inspection USDA.jpg|thumb|Inspected beef carcasses tagged by the USDA]]
[[Beef carcass classification | Beef grading]] in the United States is performed by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]'s (USDA) Agricultural and Marketing Service.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, R.O. (2001).[https://books.google.com/books?id=kouqQnLl7V4C&amp;pg=PA272 ''Introduction to Food Science''].Cengage Learning. pp. 272-277. {{ISBN|0766813142}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are eight beef quality grades, with U.S. Prime being the highest grade and U.S. Canner being the lowest grade. Beef grading is a complex process.

===Beer===
{{Main|Beer measurement}}
In [[Beer measurement#XXX marks|beer grading]], the letter "X" is used on some beers, and was traditionally a mark of beer strength, with the more Xs the greater the strength. Some sources suggest that the origin of the mark was in the [[Brewery|breweries]] of [[medieval]] [[Monastery|monasteries]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eHArQOTf_WQC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=xxx+beer+strength&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GhD5TfaXNsSq-gbquNTeDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=xxx%20beer%20strength&amp;f=false Beer: Health and Nutrition], Charles W. Bamforth, Blackwell Science Ltd 2004 {{ISBN|0-632-06446-3}} p.34&lt;/ref&gt; Another plausible explanation is contained in a treatise entitled "The Art of Brewing" published in [[London]] in 1829. It says; ''"The [[Excise|duties]] on ale and beer, which were first imposed in 1643... at a certain period, in distinguishing between [[small beer]] and strong, all ale or beer, sold at or above ten [[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]]s per barrel, was reckoned to be'' strong ''and was, therefore, subjected to a higher duty. The cask which contained this strong beer was then first marked with an X signifying ten; and hence the present quack-like denominations of XX (double X) and XXX (treble X) on the casks and accounts of the strong-ale brewers".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wF89AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=XXX+beer+strength&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fvH4Tbi8AoqwhQe9pYjyCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=XXX%20beer%20strength&amp;f=false The Art of Brewing (Published under the superintendance of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge)], Baldwin &amp; Craddock, London 1829 p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-19th century England, the use of "X" and other letters had evolved into a standardised grading system for the strength of beer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europeanbeerguide.net/beer_strengths_1860_1900.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is used as a [[trade mark]] by a number of brewers in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and the [[United States]].

[[Beer measurement#Bitterness|European Bitterness Units scale]], often abbreviated as EBU, is a scale for measuring the perceived [[bitter (taste)|bitter]]ness of [[beer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Butter===
{{Main|Butter grading}}

===Coconut milk===
Several [[Coconut milk#Preparation|grades of coconut milk]] exist: from thick at 20-22% fat to thin at 5-7% fat level.

===Coffee===
[[File:Coffee Beans closeup.jpg|thumb|Dark-roasted coffee beans]]
Coffee growers, traders, and roasters grade beans based on size, color, and a variety of other characteristics. Coffees of exceptional quality are traded as "specialty coffees" and fetch a higher price in the international market.&lt;ref&gt;Specialty Coffee Association of America. [http://www.scaa.org/?page=resources&amp;d=green-coffee-protocols ''Green Coffee Protocols''] Accessed April 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the roast, [[Coffee#Grading the roasted seeds|Coffee grading]] involves assessment of [[Coffee roasting|roasted coffee]] seed colorization and then labeling as light, medium light, medium, medium dark, dark, or very dark. A more accurate method of discerning the degree of roast involves measuring the reflected light from roasted seeds illuminated with a light source in the near [[infrared]] spectrum. This elaborate light meter uses a process known as [[spectroscopy]] to return a number that consistently indicates the roasted coffee's relative degree of roast or flavor development.

===Eggs===
In the United States, [[Egg (food)#Grading by quality and size|egg grading]] is performed by the USDA, and is based upon the interior quality of the egg (see [[Haugh unit]]) and the appearance and condition of the egg shell. Eggs of any quality grade may differ in weight (size). Egg grading is performed by candling, which involves observing the interior of eggs by placing them in front of a bright light.&lt;ref name=Sivasankar/&gt;

===Guar gum===
[[Guar gum#Grading|Guar gum grading]] involves analysis for coloration, [[viscosity]], moisture, granulation, protein content and insolubles ash.

===Honey===
[[Honey#Grading|Honey grading]] in the United States is performed voluntarily based upon [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] standards (USDA does offer inspection and grading "as on-line (in-plant) or lot inspection...upon application, on a fee-for-service basis.") . Honey is graded based upon a number of factors, including water content, flavor and aroma, absence of defects and clarity. Honey is also classified by color though it is not a factor in the grading scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELDEV3011895|title=United States Standards for Grades of Extracted Honey|publisher=USDA|accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. honey grade scales are Grade A, Grade B, Grade C and Grade substandard.

===Lobster===
[[File:Homarus americanus.jpg|thumb|A [[lobster]]]]
In the U.S., [[Lobster#Grading|lobster grading]] involves denoting lobsters as new-shell, hard-shell or old-shell, and because lobsters which have recently shed their shells are the most delicate, there is an inverse relationship between the price of American lobster and its flavour. New-shell lobsters have paper-thin shells and a worse meat-to-shell ratio, but the meat is very sweet. However, the lobsters are so delicate that even transport to Boston almost kills them, making the market for new-shell lobsters strictly local to the fishing towns where they are offloaded. Hard-shell lobsters with firm shells, but with less sweet meat, can survive shipping to Boston, New York and even Los Angeles, so they command a higher price than new-shell lobsters. Meanwhile, old-shell lobsters, which have not shed since the previous season and have a coarser flavour, can be air-shipped anywhere in the world and arrive alive, making them the most expensive. One seafood guide notes that an eight-dollar lobster dinner at a restaurant overlooking fishing piers in Maine is consistently delicious, while "the eighty-dollar lobster in a three-star Paris restaurant is apt to be as much about presentation as flavor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Paul |last=Johnson |title=Fish Forever: The Definitive Guide to Understanding, Selecting, and Preparing Healthy, Delicious, and Environmentally Sustainable Seafood | chapter=Lobster | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7645-8779-5|pages=163–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maple syrup===

Following an effort from the International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many [[maple syrup]] producer associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding the classification of maple syrup to be uniform. Whereas in the past each state or province had their own laws on the classification of maple syrup, now those laws define a unified grading system. This had been a work in progress for several years, and most of the finalization of the new grading system was made in 2014. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced in the [[Canada Gazette]] on 28 June 2014 that rules for the sale of maple syrup would be amended to include new descriptors, at the request of the IMSI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/maple-syrup-labelling-changes-on-tap-1.2690538|title=Maple syrup labelling changes on tap|publisher=CBC News|date=27 June 2014|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 31, 2014, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalmaplesyrupinstitute.com/uploads/7/0/9/2/7092109/nr_-_maple_regs_cgii_mino_approved_final_en_1_4.pdf|title=Harper Government Strengthens Competitiveness of Canada's Maple Syrup Industry|publisher=Canadian Food Inspection Agency|date=16 December 2014|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of March 2, 2015, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)&lt;ref name="usda.gov"&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELDEV3011897

}}&lt;/ref&gt; issued revised standards on the classification of maple syrup as follows:

*Grade A
**Golden Color and Delicate Taste
**Amber Color and Rich Taste
**Dark Color and Robust Taste
**Very Dark Color and Strong Taste
*Processing Grade
*Substandard

As long as maple syrup does not have an off-flavor and is of a uniform color and clean and free from [[turbidity]] and sediment, it can be labelled as one of the A grades. If it exhibits any of these problems, it does not meet Grade A requirements and must be labelled as Processing Grade maple syrup and may not be sold in containers smaller than 5 gallons.&lt;ref name="usda.gov"/&gt; If maple syrup does not meet the requirements of Processing Grade maple syrup (including a fairly characteristic maple taste), it is classified as Substandard.&lt;ref name="usda.gov"/&gt;
As of February 2015, this grading system has been accepted and made law by most maple-producing states and provinces, other than Ontario, Quebec, and Ohio. Vermont, in an effort to "jump-start" the new grading regulations, adopted the new grading system as of January 1, 2014, after the grade changes passed the Senate and House in 2013. Maine passed a bill to take effect as soon as both Canada and the United States adopted the new grades. They are allowing a one-year grace period. In New York, the new grade changes became law on January 1, 2015, with a one-year grace period. New Hampshire did not require legislative approval and so the new grade laws became effective as of December 16, 2014, and producer compliance was required as of January 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalmaplesyrupinstitute.com/downloadable-resources.html|title=United States Standards for Grades of Maple Syrup|publisher=International Maple Syrup Institute|date=29 January 2015|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Golden and Amber grades typically have a milder flavor than Dark and Very dark, which are both dark and have an intense maple flavor.&lt;ref name="dnr"/&gt; The darker grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use.&lt;ref name="mcgee"&gt;{{cite book |last=McGee |first=Harold |title=On food and cooking: the science and lore of the kitchen|edition=2nd |year=2004 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |pages=668–669|isbn=978-0-684-80001-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syrup harvested earlier in the season tends to yield a lighter color.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson|first=Jennifer|title=Very Maple Syrup|year=2003 |publisher=Celestial Arts |page=2|isbn=978-1587611810}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the new grading system, the classification of maple syrup depends ultimately on its internal [[transmittance]] at 560 nm [[wavelength]] through a 10 mm sample. Golden has to have more than 75 percent transmittance, Amber has to have 50.0 to 74.9 percent transmittance, Dark has to have 25.0 to 49.9 percent transmittance, and Very Dark is any product less than 25.0 percent transmittance.&lt;ref name="usda.gov"/&gt;

==== Old grading system ====
[[File:Syrup grades large.JPG|thumb|Old US maple syrup grades, left to right: ''Grade A Light Amber ("Fancy")'', ''Grade A Medium Amber'', ''Grade A Dark Amber'', ''Grade B'']]
[[File:Can of Quebec Maple Syrup.JPG|thumb|[[Maple syrup]] from [[Quebec]], graded as No. 1, Light (enlarge image to read the label atop the can)]]

In Canada, maple syrup was classified prior to December 31, 2014, by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) as one of three grades, each with several color classes: Canada No. 1, including Extra Light, Light, and Medium; No. 2 Amber; and No. 3 Dark or any other ungraded category. Producers in Ontario or Québec may have followed either federal or provincial grading guidelines. Québec's and Ontario's guidelines differed slightly from the federal: there were two "number" categories in Québec (Number 1, with four color classes, and 2, with five color classes).&lt;ref name="msgqc1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Maple Syrup Grades |url=http://www.siropderable.ca/Afficher.aspx?page=74&amp;langue=en |publisher=Fédération des producteurs acéricoles du Québec |accessdate=27 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828080841/http://www.siropderable.ca/Afficher.aspx?page=74&amp;langue=en |archivedate=28 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As in Québec, Ontario's producers had two "number" grades: 1, with three color classes; and 2, with one color class, which was typically referred to as "Ontario Amber" when produced and sold in that province only.&lt;ref name="omspa1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maple Syrup Grades |url=http://www.ontariomaple.com/fact-finding/pure-maple-syrup.html |publisher=Ontario Maple Syrup Producers Association |accessdate=19 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906233915/http://www.ontariomaple.com/fact-finding/pure-maple-syrup.html |archivedate=6 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical year's yield for a maple syrup producer will be about 25 to 30 percent of each of the #1 colors, 10 percent #2 Amber, and 2 percent #3 Dark.{{sfn|Elliot|2006|p=12}} Producers in Quebec and Ontario may follow either federal or provincial grading guidelines, which differ slightly.

The United States used (some states still do, as they await state regulation) different grading standards. Maple syrup was divided into two major grades: Grade A and Grade B. Grade A was further divided into three subgrades: Light Amber (sometimes known as Fancy), Medium Amber, and Dark Amber. The [[Vermont Agency of Agriculture Food and Markets]] used a similar grading system of color, and is roughly equivalent, especially for lighter syrups, but using letters: "AA", "A", etc.&lt;ref name="msgvt1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Maple Syrup Grades Vermont |url=http://www.vermontmaple.org/grades.php |publisher=Vermont Maple Syrup |accessdate=27 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307134732/http://www.vermontmaple.org/grades.php |archivedate=7 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ciesla|2002|p=41}} The Vermont grading system differed from the US system in maintaining a slightly higher standard of product density (measured on the [[Baumé scale]]). New Hampshire maintained a similar standard, but not a separate state grading scale. The Vermont-graded product had 0.9 percent more sugar and less water in its composition than US-graded. One grade of syrup not for table use, called commercial or Grade C, was also produced under the Vermont system.&lt;ref name="dnr"&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://maple.dnr.cornell.edu/FAQ.htm |publisher=Cornell Sugar Maple Research &amp; Extension Program |accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vermont inspectors enforce strict syrup grading regulations, and can fine producers up to US$1000 for labelling syrup incorrectly.{{sfn|Eagleson|Hasner|2006|p=33}}

===Milk===
In the United States, there are two [[Milk#Grading|grades of milk]], with Grade A primarily used for direct sales and consumption in stores, and Grade B used for indirect consumption, such as in cheese making or other processing.

The differences between the two grades are defined in the Wisconsin administrative code for Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection, chapter 60.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.wi.us/rsb/code/atcp/atcp060.pdf Wisconsin administrative code for Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection, Chapter ATCP 60]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-11-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Grade B generally refers to milk that is cooled in milk cans, which are immersed in a bath of cold flowing water that typically is drawn up from an underground water well rather than using mechanical refrigeration.

===Oranges===
The USDA has established the following [[Orange (fruit)#Grading|grades for Florida oranges]], which primarily apply to oranges sold as fresh fruit: US Fancy, US No. 1 Bright, US No. 1, US No. 1 Golden, US No. 1 Bronze, US No. 1 Russet, US No. 2 Bright, US No. 2, US No. 2 Russet, and US No. 3.&lt;ref name=usda_fla&gt;[http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5050382 United States Standards for Grades of Florida Oranges and Tangelos] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726100358/http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5050382 |date=July 26, 2011 }} (USDA; February, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The general characteristics graded are color (both hue and uniformity), firmness, maturity, varietal characteristics, texture, and shape. Fancy, the highest grade, requires the highest grade of color and an absence of blemishes&lt;!--original read "the highest grade of both color and blemishes". Makes no sense to me, but I'll leave it here just in case (far from an expert on the subject)--&gt;, while the terms Bright, Golden, Bronze, and Russet concern solely discoloration.

===Peas===
[[File:Peas in pods - Studio.jpg|thumb|[[Peas]]]]
[[Pea#Grading|Pea grading]] involves sorting peas by size, in which smallest peas are graded as the highest quality for their tenderness.&lt;ref name=Sivasankar/&gt; [[Brine]]s may be used, in which peas are floated in them, from which their density can be determined.&lt;ref name=Sivasankar/&gt;

===Potatoes===
In the U.S., [[Potato#Grading|potato grading]] for [[Idaho]] potatoes is performed in which No. 1 potatoes are the highest quality and No. 2 are rated as lower in quality due to their appearance (e.g. blemishes or bruises, pointy ends).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.idahopotato.com/faqs#63 | title=Frequently Asked Questions | publisher=[[Idaho Potato Commission]] | accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Density assessment can be performed by floating them in brines.&lt;ref name=Sivasankar/&gt; High density potatoes are desirable in the production of dehydrated mashed potatoes, potato crisps and french fries.&lt;ref name=Sivasankar/&gt;

===Rice===
The main criteria used by many countries and millers in [[Grain quality#Classification and grading of rice|rice grading]] are degree of milling, appearance (color), damaged (broken) and percentage of chalky kernels. In the United States rice is marketed according to three main properties size, color and condition (kernels damage), these properties are directly related to quality, milling percentage and other processing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Serna-Saldivar, S.O. 2012. Cereal grains Laboratory Reference and Procedures Manual. Food Preservation Technology Series. LLC NW. CRC Press. Taylor and Francis Group.&lt;/ref&gt; All properties are considered important in grading. For instance, chalky kernels are not desirable because they give lower milling yields after processing and easily break during handling.

===Spices===

====Cinnamon====
In [[Sri Lanka]], [[Cinnamon#Grading|cinnamon grading]] is performed by dividing cinnamon quills into four groups, which are then further divided into specific grades.

====Vanilla====
[[Image:Sambava - grading vanilla beans.jpg|thumb|People grading [[Vanilla|vanilla bean]]s in [[Sambava]], [[Madagascar]]]]
Several [[Vanilla#Grading|vanilla fruit grading systems]] are in use. Each country which produces vanilla has its own grading system,&lt;ref name="Havkin grading"&gt;{{cite book|last=Havkin-Frenkel|first=Daphna|title=Handbook of Vanilla Science and Technology|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Chichester, UK|isbn=978-1-4051-9325-2|author2=Belanger, Faith C.|pages=142–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; and individual vendors, in turn, sometimes use their own criteria for describing the quality of the fruits they offer for sale.&lt;ref name=VanillaReview&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vanillareview.com/vanilla-information/#grades | title = Vanilla | accessdate = 2012-01-15 | publisher = VanillaReview.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tea===
{{Main|Tea leaf grading}}
In the western black [[tea]] industry, [[tea leaf grading]] is the process of [[Evaluation|evaluating]] products based on the quality and condition of the tea leaves themselves. The highest grades are referred to as "orange pekoe", and the lowest as "fannings" or "dust". This grading system is based upon the size of processed and dried black tea leaves. Despite a purported Chinese origin, these grading terms are typically used for teas from Sri Lanka, India and countries other than China; they are not generally known within Chinese-speaking countries.

====Black tea====
[[Black tea#Tea grading|Black tea grading]] is usually based upon one of four scales of quality. Whole-leaf teas are the highest quality, followed by broken leaves, [[fannings]], and dusts. Whole-leaf teas are produced with little or no alteration to the tea leaf. This results in a finished product with a coarser texture than that of bagged teas. Whole-leaf teas are widely considered the most valuable, especially if they contain leaf tips. Broken leaves are commonly sold as medium-grade loose teas. Smaller broken varieties may be included in tea bags.

File:Black tea grading.jpg|A [[black tea]] leaf grading diagram
File:TeaLeaves.JPG|Fresh tea leaves of different sizes
&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Rooibos====
[[Rooibos#Grading|Rooibos grades]] are largely related to the proportion of "needle" or leaf to stem content in the mix. A higher leaf content will result in a darker liquor, richer flavour and less "dusty" aftertaste. The high-grade rooibos is exported and does not reach local markets, with major consumers being in the EU, particularly Germany, where it is used in creating flavoured blends for loose-leaf tea markets. In development within South Africa are a small number of specialty tea companies producing similar blends.

===Carrageenan===
There are two basic [[Carrageenan#Grades|grades of carrageenan]], refined carrageenan (RC) and semi-refined carrageenan (SRC). In the United States, RC and SRC are both labeled as carrageenan. In the European Union, RC is designated by the [[E number]] E-407, and SRC is E-407a. RC has a 2% maximum for acid-insoluble material and is produced through an alcohol precipitation process or potassium chloride gel press process. SRC contains a much higher level of cellulosic content and is produced in a less complex process. Indonesia, the Philippines, and Chile are three main sources of raw material and extracted carrageenan.

===Lye===
[[Lye#Food uses|Lye]] is used to [[Curing (food preservation)|cure]] foods such as [[lutefisk]], [[olive]]s (making them less bitter), canned [[mandarin orange]]s, [[hominy]], [[lye roll]]s, [[century egg]]s, and [[pretzel]]s. It is also used as a tenderizer in the crust of baked Cantonese [[mooncake]]s, and in lye-water "[[zongzi]]" ([[glutinous rice]] dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves), chewy southern Chinese noodles popular in Hong Kong and southern China, and Japanese [[ramen noodles]]. In the [[United States]], food-grade lye must meet the requirements outlined in the [[Food Chemicals Codex|Food Chemicals Codex (FCC)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usp.org/fcc/|title=USP Food Ingredient Standards|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as prescribed by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).&lt;ref name=FDA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/opacom/laws/fdcact/fdcact4.htm|title=Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act)|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower grades of lye are commonly used as [[drain cleaner|drain]] or oven cleaner. Such grades should not be used for food preparation, as they may contain impurities harmful to human health.&lt;ref name="FDA"/&gt;

===Sodium bisulphate===
[[Sodium bisulphate#In food|Sodium bisulphate]] is used as a [[food additive]] to leaven cake mixes (make them rise) as well as being used in meat and poultry processing and most recently in browning prevention of fresh-cut produce. The food-grade product meets the requirements set out in the Food Chemicals Codex.  It is denoted by [[E number]] E514ii in the EU and is approved for use in Australia and New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2012C00863|title=Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code - Standard 1.2.4 - Labelling of Ingredients|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is listed as additive 514.  Food-grade sodium bisulfate is used in a variety of food products, including beverages, dressings, sauces, and fillings.

'''Genetic sexual attraction''' is a theorised concept in which a strong sexual attraction may develop between close blood relatives who first meet as adults. There is no direct evidence for "genetic attraction" being an actual phenomenon and the theory has been criticized as [[pseudoscience]].

== Theory ==
The term was coined in the US in the late 1980s by Barbara Gonyo, the founder of ''Truth Seekers In Adoption'', a Chicago-based support group for [[Adoption|adoptees]] and their new-found relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Genetic sexual attraction |first=Alix |last= Kirsta |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 May 2003 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/may/17/weekend7.weekend2}}&lt;/ref&gt; She developed sexual feelings for her son when she met him after he was adopted away, but he did not want to be part of any such contact.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

People tend to select mates who are like themselves.&lt;ref name=Klohnen /&gt;  This holds for both physical appearance and mental traits. People commonly rank faces similar to their own as more attractive, trustworthy, etc. than average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Penton-Voak|first=I.S.|title=Computer graphic studies of the role of facial similarity in judgements of attractiveness|journal=Current Psychology: Developmental, Learning, Personality, Social|date=Spring 1999|volume=18|issue=1|pages=104–117 |url=http://www.psyc.nott.ac.uk/research/vision/jwp/papers/pentonvoak1999.pdf |doi=10.1007/s12144-999-1020-4|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bereczkei (2004) attributes this in part to childhood [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] on the opposite-sex parent. The study also reported a correlation of 0.233 for [[extraversion]] and 0.235 for inconsistency (using [[Eysenck Personality Questionnaire|Eysenck's Personality Inventory]]). A review of many previous studies found these numbers to be quite common.&lt;ref name=Klohnen&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=David|last2=Klohnen |first2=Eva C. |last3=Casillas |first3=Alex |last4=Nus Simms |first4=Ericka |last5=Haig |first5=Jeffrey |last6=Berry |first6=Diane S.|title=Match Makers and Deal Breakers: Analyses of Assortative Mating in Newlywed Couples|journal=[[Journal of Personality]]|date=1 October 2004|volume=72|issue=5|pages=1029–1068|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3506.2004.00289.x|pmid=15335336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because many traits are at least partially determined by genetics, genetic sexual attraction is presumed according to the theory to occur as a consequence of genetic relatives meeting as adults, typically as a consequence of adoption. However this is a very rare consequence of adoptive reunions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Current (radio program)|The Current]] |title=Part 2: Genetic Sexual Attraction – Part One |url=http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/2009/200905/20090507.html |author=[[Bob McKeown]] |author2=Aziza Sindhu |publisher=[[CBC Radio]] |date=May 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Incest]] is extremely rare between people raised together in early childhood due to a reverse [[sexual imprinting]] known as the [[Westermarck effect]], which desensitizes them to later close sexual attraction. It is hypothesized that this effect [[Evolution|evolved]] to prevent [[inbreeding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lieberman|first=Debra|author2=Tooby, John |author3=Cosmides, Leda |title=The architecture of human kin detection|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=445|issue=7129|pages=727–731|doi=10.1038/nature05510|pmid=17301784|pmc=3581061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fessler|first=Daniel M.T.|author2=Navarrete, C.David|title=Third-party attitudes toward sibling incest|journal=[[Evolution and Human Behavior]]|volume=25|issue=5|pages=277–294|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2004.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the theory have called it [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.salon.com/2016/08/16/debunking-genetic-sexual-attraction-incest-by-any-other-name-is-still-incest/|title=Debunking genetic sexual attraction: Incest by any other name is still incest|date=2016-08-16|work=Salon|access-date=2018-09-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amanda Marcotte]] of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' has stated that the term is nothing but a an attempt at sounding scientific while trying to minimize the taboo of incest. She also expressed that many news outlets have handled reports of the subject poorly by repeating what the defenders of the theory have said as opposed to actually looking into the research on the supossed phenomenon. She states that most of the publications which have choosen to run stories of couples speaking about "genetic sexual attraction" are not legetimate news sources and that one of the blogs which were written by a woman in an incestious relationship simply reads like a story of a young girl who's been [[grooming (child abuse)|groomed]] by her father.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This system uses the amount of energy, the extent of soft-tissue injury and the extent of contamination for determination of fracture severity. Progression from grade 1 to 3C implies a higher degree of energy involved in the injury, higher soft tissue and bone damage and higher potential for complications. It is important to recognize that a Gustilo score of grade 3C implies vascular injury as well as bone and connective-tissue damage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.orthobullets.com/trauma/1003/gustilo-classification&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reliability ==
There are many discussions regarding the inter-observer reliability of this classification system. Different studies have shown inter-observer reliability of approximately 60% (ranging from 42% to 92%),&lt;ref&gt;Brumback RJ, Jones AL. Interobserver agreement in the classification of open fractures of the tibia: The results of a survey of two hundred and forty-five orthopaedic surgeons. J Bone Joint Surg Am. 1994;76:1162–6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cross WW, Swiontkowski M. Treatment principles in the management of open fractures.Indian J Orthop. 2008 Oct-Dec; 42(4): 377–386.&lt;/ref&gt; representing poor-to-moderate agreement of scale grading between health-care professionals. This is due to much of the criteria being at risk of observer errors, and is a known liability of this scaling system. However, this classification is simple and hence easy to use, and is generally able to predict [[prognosis|prognostic]] outcomes and guide treatment regimes. Generally, the higher the grading of Gustillo classification, the higher the rate of infection and complications; any Guistilo classification rating should still be interpreted with caution due to observer errors before any definite therapeutic plans are made.&lt;ref name="Paul 2012"/&gt; 

Although this classification system has a fairly good ability to predict fracture outcomes, it is not perfect. The Gustillo classification does not take into account the viability and death of soft tissues over time which can affect the outcome of the injury. Besides, the number of the underlying medical illnesses of the patient also affects the outcome. Whether the timing of wound debridement, soft tissue coverage, and bone have any benefits on the outcome is also questionable. Besides, different types of bones have different rates of infection because they are covered by different amounts of soft tissues. Gustilo initially does not recommend early wound closure and early fixation for Grade III fractures. However newer studies have shown that early wound closure and early fixation reduces infection rates, promotes fracture healing and early restoration of function. Therefore, assessment of all open fractures should include the mechanism of injury, the appearance of soft tissues, the likely levels of bacterial contamination and the specific characteristics of the fractures. Accurate assessment of the fracture can only be performed inside an operating theatre.&lt;ref name="Paul 2012"/&gt; 

For more comprehensive prognosis purposes other classification systems, such as the Sickness Impact Profile (as a health status measure),&lt;ref name="Paul 2012"/&gt; Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS) and Limb Salvage Index (LSI) (decision to amputate or salvage a limb), have been devised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rajasekaran|first1=Shanmuganathan|title=The utility of scores in the decision to salvage or amputation in severely injured limbs|journal=Indian Journal of Orthopaedics|date=October 2008|volume=42|issue=4|pages=268–376|doi=10.4103/0019-5413.43371|pmid=19753223|pmc=2740356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1976, Gustilo and Anderson refined the early classification system proposed by Veliskasis in 1959. An early study conducted by Gustilo in 1976 showed that primary closures with prophylactic antibiotics of Type I and type II fractures reduced the risk of infection by 84.4%. Meanwhile, early [[internal fixation]] and primary closure of the wound in Type III fractures have a greater risk of getting [[osteomyelitis]]. However, Type III fractures occur in 60% of all the open fracture cases. Infection of the Type III fractures is observed in 10% to 50% of the time. Therefore, in 1984, Gustilo subclassified Type III fractures into A, B, and C with the aim of guiding the treatment of open fractures, communication and research, and to predict outcomes. Based of the results of the previous studies, Gustilo initially recommended [[therapeutic irrigation]] and surgical [[debridement]] for all fractures with primary closure for Type I and II fractures; secondary closure without internal fixation for Type III fractures. However, soon after that, he recommended internal fixation devices for Type III fractures.&lt;ref name="Paul 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paul|first1=H Kim|last2=Seth|first2=S Leopold|title=Gustilo-Anderson Classification|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|date=9 May 2012|volume=470|issue=11|pages=3270–3274|doi=10.1007/s11999-012-2376-6|pmid=22569719|pmc=3462875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean-Charles, chevalier de Borda''' (4 May 1733 – 19 February 1799) was a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]], [[physicist]], and [[sailor]].

==Life history==

Borda was born in the city of [[Dax, Landes|Dax]] to Jean‐Antoine de Borda and Jeanne‐Marie Thérèse de Lacroix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers |last=Hockey |first=Thomas |year=2009 |publisher=[[Springer Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-387-31022-0 |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/58185.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1756, Borda wrote ''Mémoire sur le mouvement des projectiles'', a product of his work as a [[military engineer]].  For that, he was elected to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1764.

Borda was a mariner and a scientist, spending time in the [[Caribbean]] testing out advances in chronometers.  Between 1777 and 1778, he participated in the [[American Revolutionary War]].  In 1781, he was put in charge of several vessels in the [[French Navy]].   In 1782, he was [[Action of 6 December 1782|captured by the English]], and was returned to France shortly after. He returned as an engineer in the French Navy, making improvements to waterwheels and pumps. He was appointed as France's Inspector of Naval Shipbuilding in 1784, and with the assistance of the naval architect [[Jacques-Noël Sané]] in 1786 introduced a massive construction programme to revitalise the French navy based on the standard designs of Sané.

In 1770, Borda formulated a ranked preferential [[voting system]] that is referred to as the [[Borda count]].  The [[French Academy of Sciences]] used Borda's method to elect its members for about two decades until it was quashed by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] who insisted that his own method be used after he became president of the Académie in 1801. The Borda count is in use today in some academic institutions, competitions and several political jurisdictions. The Borda count has also served as a basis for other methods such as the [[Quota Borda system]] and [[Nanson's method]].

In 1778, he published his method of reducing Lunar Distances for computing the longitude, still regarded as the best of several similar mathematical procedures for navigation and position-fixing in pre-chronometer days; and used, for example, by [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clarke]] to measure their latitude and longitude during their exploration of the North-western United States.

Another of his contributions is his construction of the standard ''metre'', basis of the [[metric system]] to correspond to the measurements of [[Delambre]].

[[File:Cercle de reflexion img 2600.jpg|thumb|Reflecting circle, on display at Toulon naval museum]]
As an instrument maker, he improved the [[reflecting instrument#Reflecting circles|reflecting circle]] (invented by [[Tobias Mayer]]) and the [[repeating circle]] (invented by his assistant, [[Etienne Lenoir (instrument maker)|Etienne Lenoir]]), the latter used to measure the [[meridian arc]] from [[Dunkirk]] to [[Barcelona]] by [[Delambre]] and [[Méchain]].

==Tables of logarithms&lt;ref&gt;''Tables Trigonométriques Décimales ou Table des Logaritihmes des Sinus, Sécantes et Tangentes, Suivant la Divisiondu Quart de Cercle en 100 degrés, du Degré en  100 Minutes, et de la Minute en 100 Secondes'' revues, augmentées et publiées par J. B. Delambre, Paris, AN IX (1801), L'Imprimerie de la République&lt;/ref&gt;==

With the advent of the metric system after the French Revolution it was decided that the quarter circle should be divided into 100 degrees instead of 90 degrees, and the degree into 100 seconds instead of 60 seconds. This required the calculation of trigonometric tables and logarithms corresponding to the new size of the degree and instruments for measuring angles in the new system.

Borda constructed instruments for measuring angles in the new units (the instrument could no longer be called a "sextant") which was later used in the measurement of the meridian between Dunkirk and Barcelona by Delambre to determine the length of the metre. The tables of logarithms of sines, secants, and tangents were also required for the purposes of navigation. Borda was an enthusiast for the metric system and constructed tables of these logarithms starting in 1792 but their publication was delayed until after his death and only published in the Year 9 (1801) as ''Tables of Logarithms of sines, secants, and tangents, co-secants, co-sines, and co-tangents for the Quarter of the Circle divided into 100 degrees, the degree into 100 minutes, and the minute into 100 seconds'' to ten decimals, and including his tables of logarithms to 7 decimals from 10,000 to 100,000 with tables for obtaining results to 10 decimals.

The division of the degree into hundredths was accompanied by the division of the day into 10 hours of 100 minutes and maps were required to show the new degrees of latitude and longitude.  The [[French Republican Calendar|Republican Calendar]] was abolished by Napoleon in 1806, but the 400-degree circle lived on as the [[Gradian]].

==Honours==
*Five [[French ship Borda|French ships were named ''Borda'']] in his honour.
*The crater [[Borda (crater)|Borda]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him.
*Asteroide [http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/lists/NumberedMPs175001.html 175726] has been called Borda in his honour.

It was the first spaceflight to send animals into orbit and return them safely back to Earth. Launched on 19 August 1960, it paved the way for the first human orbital flight, [[Vostok 1]], which was launched less than eight months later.

Korabl-Sputnik 2 was the second attempt to launch a Vostok capsule with dogs on board. The first try on 28 July, carrying a pair named Bars (Snow Leopard aka. Chaika (Seagull)) and Lisichka (Foxie)), had been unsuccessful after the Blok G strap-on suffered a fire and breakdown in one of the combustion chambers, followed by its breaking off of the booster 19 seconds after launch. Around 30 seconds, the launch vehicle disintegrated, the core and strap-ons flying in random directions and crashing into the steppe. Flight controllers sent a command to jettison the payload shroud and separate the descent module, but due to the low altitude, the parachutes only deployed partially, and the dogs were killed on impact with the ground. It was believed that the combustion chamber disintegration was due to longitudinal vibrations. This created a considerable uproar, as the problem, which had plagued earlier 8K72 launches, had supposedly been corrected. It was ultimately traced to deficient manufacturing practices at the R-7 assembly plant.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The accident also encouraged the development of an ejector seat for the cosmonaut to escape from the capsule in the event of a launch failure, since the parachutes in the descent module would not be able to open properly until around 40 seconds into launch. This occurred, ironically, one day before the US program suffered a serious setback [[Mercury-Atlas 1|with the loss of a Mercury capsule]].

A commonly circulated film clip depicting a Vostok booster lifting followed by the movement of its shadow on the ground is often assumed to be from [[Vostok 1]]'s launch; however, it was actually the ill-fated flight of 28 July 1960.

The launch of Korabl-Sputnik 2 occurred on 19 August 1960, using a [[Vostok-L]] [[carrier rocket]]. Official sources reported the launch time to have been 08:44:06 UTC; however, Sergei Voevodin gave it as 08:38:24.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} A radio station in [[Bonn]], [[West Germany]], was among the first to pick up signals from the spacecraft, which were confirmed on the third orbit by a [[Sweden|Swedish]] radio station.

The spacecraft carried two dogs, [[Belka and Strelka]], 40 [[mice]], two [[rat]]s and a variety of [[plant]]s, as well as a television camera, which took images of the dogs. One of its objectives was to intercept the US [[Echo (satellite)|Echo 1A satellite]], which was a passive, nitrogen-filled balloon covered in reflective foil and thus highly visible as it passed overhead. Korabl-Sputnik 2 passed near Echo on the second orbit, and the radio system returned audio of the dogs barking as they saw it out the window. The spacecraft returned to Earth at 06:00:00 UTC on 20 August, the day after its launch. Telemetry revealed that one dog had suffered seizures during the fourth orbit, and it was decided to limit the first manned flight to three orbits. All of the animals were recovered safely, and a year later Strelka had a litter of puppies, one of which was sent to First Lady of the US [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] as a goodwill present from the Soviet Union. President Kennedy's advisers initially opposed taking the dog for fear that the Soviets might have planted microphones in its body to listen in on national defense meetings.

Strelka and Belka were both [[taxidermy|taxidermied]] after their deaths and placed on display in the Moscow Museum of Space and Aeronautics.

In the LLNL RISE process a part of the [[oil shale]] deposit (roughly 20% of the total deposit) is removed by the conventional mining technique. The remaining deposit is then broken up with explosives to increase [[porosity]] of the deposit. As a result, a large underground retort chamber by {{convert|20|to|100|m}} square and {{convert|100|to|300|m}} high is created. The retort chamber is ignited  at the top. The combustion zone moves downward as an [[oxygen]] gas provided, similar to the [[Occidental Petroleum#Oil shale|process developed by the Occidental Petroleum]]. The heat causes retorting process converting [[kerogen]] in oil shale to [[oil shale gas]] and [[shale oil]] vapors.  Some oil is collected at the bottom of the retort, other collected at the surface as vapors.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;&lt;ref name=daniels&gt;

The process was never used commercially. It was tested by using experimental  simulated retort with capacity of 6 tonnes of oil shale per day.&lt;ref name=daniels/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3941">Professor '''Lin Chao''' is a [[Chinese Brazilian]] American [[evolutionary biologist]] and [[geneticist]]. Professor Chao gained his [[PhD]] in 1977 from the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], as a student of Bruce R. Levin (now at [[Emory University]]), and was a [[NIH]] postdoctoral fellow at [[Princeton University]] in the laboratory of Edward C. Cox. He spent most of his career in the Department of Biology of the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] and is currently at the [[Ecology]], Behavior and Evolution Section of the [[University of California, San Diego]].

Professor Chao is best known for his early work on the evolution of [[bacteriocins]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/78/10/6324|title=Structured habitats and the evolution of anticompetitor toxins in bacteria|first1=L.|last1=Chao|first2=B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46804">This '''list of prehistoric ostracods''' is an attempt to create a comprehensive listing of all [[Genus|genera]] from the fossil record that have ever been considered to be members of the [[Ostracod]]a, excluding purely vernacular terms. The list includes all commonly accepted genera, but also genera that are now considered invalid, doubtful (''[[nomen dubium|nomina dubia]]''), or were not formally published (''[[nomen nudum|nomina nuda]]''), as well as [[synonym (zoology)|junior synonyms]] of more established names, and genera that are no longer considered ostracods. 
&lt;!--
==Naming conventions and terminology==
Naming conventions and terminology follow the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]. Technical terms used include:
* '''[[Synonym (zoology)|Junior synonym]]''': A name which describes the same [[taxon]] as a previously published name. If two or more genera are formally designated and the [[type (zoology)|type specimens]] are later assigned to the same genus, the first to be published (in chronological order) is the senior synonym, and all other instances are junior synonyms. Senior synonyms are generally used, except by special decision of the ICZN, but junior synonyms cannot be used again, even if deprecated. Junior synonymy is often subjective, unless the genera described were both based on the same type specimen.
*'''''[[Nomen nudum]]''''' (Latin for "naked name"): A name that has appeared in print but has not yet been formally published by the standards of the ICZN. ''Nomina nuda'' (the plural form) are invalid, and are therefore not italicized as a proper generic name would be. If the name is later formally published, that name is no longer a ''nomen nudum'' and will be italicized on this list. Often, the formally published name will differ from any ''nomina nuda'' that describe the same specimen.
*'''''[[Nomen oblitum]]''''' (Latin for "forgotten name"): A name that has not been used in the scientific community for more than fifty years after its original proposal.
*'''''[[Preoccupied name]]''''': A name that is formally published, but which has already been used for another taxon. This second use is invalid (as are all subsequent uses) and the name must be replaced. As preoccupied names are not valid generic names, they will also go unitalicized on this list.
*'''''[[Nomen dubium]]''''' (Latin for "dubious name"): A name describing a fossil with no unique diagnostic features. As this can be an extremely subjective and controversial designation, this term is not used on this list.

'''Lithophytes''' are [[plants]] that grow in or on [[Rock (geology)|rocks]]. Those that grow on rocks are also known as '''epipetric''' or '''epilithic''' plants. Lithophytes that grow on land feed off nutrients from rain water and nearby decaying plants, including their own dead tissue. [[wikt:chasmophyte|Chasmophytes]] grow in fissures in rocks where soil or organic matter has accumulated.

Examples of lithophytes include several ''[[Paphiopedilum]]'' [[orchids]], [[fern]]s, many [[algae]] and [[liverwort]]s. Species that only grow on rock or gravel are [[obligate]] lithophytes. Species that grow on rocky substrate and elsewhere are [[facultative]] lithophytes.

As nutrients tend to be rarely available to lithophytes or chasmophytes, many species of [[carnivorous plants]] can be viewed as being [[Preadaptation|pre-adapted]] to life on rocks. By consuming prey, these plants can gather more nutrients than non-carnivorous lithophtytes.&lt;ref name=Habitat&gt;McPherson, S.R. (2010). ''Carnivorous Plants and their Habitats. Volume 1.'' Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. pp.&amp;nbsp;176–180.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[pitcher plant]]s ''[[Nepenthes campanulata]]'' and ''[[Heliamphora exappendiculata]]'', many ''[[Pinguicula]]'' and several ''[[Utricularia]]'' species.

According to the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Bradd Shore]], the '''''neuromantic'''''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Shore|first=Bradd|title=Culture in Mind: Cognition, Culture, and the Problem of Meaning|url=|volume=|pages=141, 143–4|year=1996|location=|publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=|isbn=|id=|authorlink=Bradd Shore|coauthors=}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the cybernetic frame of mind among excited computer enthusiasts as they experience what Michael Heim called "the all-at-once simultaneity of totalizing presentness".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Shore explains that "the sense of mastery over language resources that word processing bestows on the experienced user is intimately related to [[Martin Heidegger]]'s notion of [[Gestell|enframing ''(Bestellen'')]], a subjection of the world to human will that Heidegger saw as a characteristic of all modern technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

There are sources that claim the concept of neuromantic is not only confined to computer enthusiasts. For instance, there is the so-called neuromantic imagination that inspire architects. Here, the cybernetic frame of mind is fired by the concept of the "third nature," which is occupied by those who inhabit not the actual terrain in which we live, work, and play but the virtual space of media flows that enter the "unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teletechnologies, Place, and Community|last=Wilken|first=Rowan|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9780415875950|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Flow (psychology)|Flowstates]].

[[File:New England hospital for woman and children (NYPL b11707585-G90F366 003F).tiff|thumb|New England Hospital for Women and Children]]

== Founding ==
[[File:Dimock2.jpg|thumb|Susan Dimock]]
[[Marie Elizabeth Zakrzewska|Marie Zakrzewska]] was born on September 9, 1829 in Berlin. In one of her memoirs she wrote “I prefer to be remembered only as a woman who was willing to work for the elevation of woman.” She did just that by starting the hospital. As a child she followed her mother (a midwife) around the school of midwifery where she worked. Once she was 18 she applied to study midwifery, which was the only part of medicine women were allowed to work in, at the Royal Charité Hospital in Berlin. She was rejected, however she continued to apply at ages 19 and 20, but was still rejected. It was only once Dr. Joseph Hermann Schmidt, who worked at the school, used his influence to get her in that she finally was able to study medicine. Later, she moved to America, where women were allowed to be doctors.

Once in New York, she met [[Elizabeth Blackwell|Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell]], who helped her to become a doctor. The two of them opened the New York Infirmary for Women and Children on May 1, 1857. This lead her to go to Boston to meet with the board at the New England Female College, where she was offered, and accepted, a position as a professor of Obstetrics, and Diseases of Women and Children and the head of the clinical program. She eventually resigned. With the help of members of the board of the New England Female College as well as [[Ednah Dow Littlehale Cheney|Ednah D. Cheney (legal sponsor)]], Lucy Goddard (legal sponsor),  Mrs. George G. Lee (donated $3000), and [[Samuel Edmund Sewall|Samuel E. Sewall]] (donated $1000), she opened the '''New England Hospital for Women and Children''' on July 1, 1862.

== The Hospital ==
The goal of the hospital was “1) to provide for women medical aid of competent physicians of their own sex; 2) to assist educated women in the practical study of medicine; and 3) to train nurses for the care of the sick.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~sch00823|title=New England Hospital for Women and Children. Records, 1914-1954 (inclusive), 1950-1954          (bulk): A Finding Aid|website=oasis.lib.harvard.edu|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Zakrzewska was devoted to providing obstetric care to all who needed it, regardless of race or economic status.

At the start of the hospital, the staff consisted of Dr. Zakrzewska, 2 interns, and 2 consulting physicians. By 1900 there was a residient physician, 54 attending, assisting, and advisory physicians, and 13 consulting physicians.

All staff and doctors that worked there were women until 1950, when a lack of money led the board to reverse the policy. The policy was again reversed in 1952 to only allow women to be on the staff. This was reversed a final time in 1962 when the by-laws were rewritten.

In 1864, the Massachusetts state legislature gave the hospital a grant of $5000, allowing it to expand down Pleasant street. The hospital also acquired property behind the hospital at the end of 1864. This allowed the hospital to split into 3 parts. A hospital, a dispensary, and an inpatient facility.

In 1865, Dr. Anita Tyng was hired as a surgeon. She was the first woman in the US to ever be listed as specializing in surgery by a hospital. She is one of the women who sent a letter [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] founder in January 1867 requesting to "continue the study of Chemistry in the Technological Institute."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life and letters of William Barton Rogers / edited by his wife ; with the assistance of William T. Sedgwick|last=Rogers|first=William Barton|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1896|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, the hospital moved to Codman Avenue in suburban Roxbury, and the dispensary stayed in the center of Boston. This new hospital opened a nursing school, the first in America. The first American trained nurse, [[Linda Richards]] (graduated 1873) and the first black nurse, [[Mary Eliza Mahoney]] (graduated 1879) were both trained at the nursing school. Unfortunately the nursing school was closed in 1951.

The hospital remained dedicated to women and children until 1951 when it  was renamed the '''New England Hospital'''. Part of this decision was to reflect that it was now open to men as well as women and children. The hospital decided to open it to men because of financial difficulties.

In 1969 the hospital was renamed again. This time it was named '''The Dimock Community Health Center.''' It was named after [[Susan Dimock]], a resident doctor (surgeon) at the hospital who drowned in the shipwreck of the [[SS Schiller]] on May 7, 1875 when she was just 28. Because of its history, the [[Dimock Community Health Center Complex|clinic's buildings]] are listed as a [[National Historic Landmark]]. All of the buildings at the '''Dimock Center''' are named after women.

== Current Day ==
From the Center’s historic nine-acre campus located in the Egleston Square section of Roxbury, MA, and several satellite locations, The Dimock Center provides access to high-quality healthcare and human services that include: Adult &amp; Pediatric Primary Care, Women’s Healthcare, Eye and Dental Care, HIV/AIDS Specialty Care, Outpatient Mental Health services, Residential Programs, The Mary Eliza Mahoney House shelter for families, pre-school, Head Start programs, after-school programs and Adult Basic Education &amp; Workforce Training programs.
[[File:BostonMA DimockCenter ZakrzewskaBuilding.jpg|thumb|A photo of the Dimock Center in 2013 (Zakrzewska Building)]]
'''The Dimock Center''' has been recognized nationally as a model for the delivery of integrated care in an urban community.

The [[United States Armed Forces]] defines '''personnel recovery''' as "The sum of military, [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] civilian, DOD contractor personnel, or other personnel designated by the [[President of the United States|President]] or [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], who are isolated, missing, detained, or captured (IMDC) in an operational environment.  Also called PR." 
The [[Joint Personnel Recovery Agency]] is the Chairman's Controlled Activity and is designated as DoD's office of primary responsibility for DoD-wide personnel recovery (PR) matters, less policy. 

The [[European Personnel Recovery Centre]] facilitates the harmonisation of personnel recovery policy, doctrine and standards through clear lines of communications with partners stakeholders (nations and international organizations)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eprc.it/structure/&lt;/ref&gt;.

==The five PR execution tasks==
# Report: Begins with the recognition of an isolating event.  It must be both timely and accurate.
# Locate: Involves the effort to find and authenticate isolated personnel.  Accurate position and positive ID are generally required prior to committing forces.
# Support: Involves support for isolated personnel and their families.  It can include establishing two-way communications, dropping supplies, or suppressing enemy threats.
# Recover: Involves coordinated actions of commanders and staffs, recovery forces and the isolated individual.
# Reintegrate: The primary consideration is the physical and mental health of the recovered personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1056a: Reintegration of recovered Department of Defense personnel; post-isolation support activities for other recovered personnel|url=http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-section1056a&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim#sourcecredit|website=uscode.house.gov|publisher=uscode.house.gov|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pierre Le Roy.jpg|thumb|Pierre Le Roy (1717–1785).]]
'''Pierre Le Roy''' (1717–1785) was a French [[clockmaker]]. He was the inventor of the [[detent escapement]], the [[Balance wheel|temperature-compensated balance]] and the [[Balance spring|isochronous balance spring]]. His developments are considered as the foundation of the modern precision [[clock]]. Le Roy was born in [[Paris]], eldest son of [[Julien Le Roy]], a clockmaker to [[Louis XV]] who had worked with [[Henry Sully]],&lt;ref name="Macey"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F7wNQk219KMC&amp;pg=PA348 ''Encyclopedia of time'' Samuel L. Macey p.348]&lt;/ref&gt; in which place Pierre Le Roy succeeded his father. He had three brothers: [[Julien Le Roy]] (1686-1759) a clockmaker and watchmaker, [[Julien-David Le Roy]] (1724–1803) an architect, and [[Charles Le Roy (physician)|Charles Le Roy]] (1726–1779), a physician and [[Encyclopédistes|Encyclopédiste]].

==Invention of the detent escapement==
[[File:Description of the Le Roy detent escapement mechanism 14 August 1748.jpg|thumb|left|Description of the Le Roy detent escapement mechanism by the [[Académie des Sciences]], 14 August 1748.]]
[[File:Le Roy escapement mechanism.jpg|thumb|250px|Le Roy [[detent escapement]] mechanism.]]
In 1748, he invented a pivoted detent type of escapement,&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;''Britten's Watch &amp; Clock Makers' Handbook Dictionary &amp; Guide Fifteenth Edition'' p.122 [https://books.google.com/books?id=s-cOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA122]&lt;/ref&gt; or detached escapement,&lt;ref name="Macey"/&gt; which makes him the inventor of the [[Escapement#Detent escapement|detent escapement]]:&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; "The invention of the detached escapement belongs to P. Le Roy".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=thAAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA159 ''A Journal of natural philosophy, chemistry and the arts'' p.159]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was distinguished principally in his mastery and improvement of the [[clock]] and [[chronograph]], above all of the [[marine chronometer]], in which he carried forward the pioneering work of [[John Harrison]]. He took a different approach from that of Harrison, believing that the way to achieve seaworthiness was to detach the escapement from the balance.&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;''Biographical dictionary of the history of technology'' Lance Day, Ian McNeil p.429 [https://books.google.com/books?id=nqAOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA429]&lt;/ref&gt; He also differed from Harrison regarding his temperature compensation method, which used the variation of the rotation radius of the balance by modifying the diameter of the balance through bi-metallic components, a method which would become a standard in chronometers.&lt;ref name="Day"/&gt; His technique for temperature compensation was highly efficient in that it worked without changing the length of the spiral balance spring, which he had discovered to be [[isochronous]] only at a precise given length (i.e. when frequency is independent of amplitude, so that a [[mechanical clock]] or [[watch]] runs at the same rate regardless of changes in its drive force, so it keeps correct time as the [[mainspring]] unwinds).&lt;ref name="Day"/&gt;

==Development of the modern marine chronometer==

[[File:Le Roy chronometer.jpg|300px|thumb|Plans of Le Roy chronometer]]
After having designed plans in 1754, he constructed his first chronometers by 1756, and accomplished his masterpiece in 1766.&lt;ref name="Macey"/&gt; This remarkable chronometer incorporated a detached escapement, a temperature-compensated balance and an [[isochronous]] balance spring, innovations which would be adopted in subsequent chronometers.&lt;ref name="Macey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Day"/&gt; Harrison demonstrated a reliable chronometer at sea, but these developments by Le Roy are considered by [[Rupert Gould]] to be the foundation of the modern chronometer.&lt;ref name="Macey"/&gt; Pierre Le Roy's chronometer had a performance equivalent to that of the Harrison H4 chronometer.&lt;ref name="Day"/&gt;

In 1769 he was awarded the double prize offered by the [[Académie française]] for the best method of measuring time at sea. He succeeded in giving his instruments the greatest possible regularity by the discovery of the isochronous spiral spring, in which he was in competition with [[Ferdinand Berthoud]], but which he published first.

He was the author of several valuable publications on the art and science of clock-making and chronography, among them the ''Étrennes chronométriques'' of 1760. He also became ''Horloger du Roi'' in 1760.&lt;ref name="Day"/&gt;

The work of Le Roy was not fully recognized in France however, and his contemporary [[Ferdinand Berthoud]] became more famous, obtaining the prestigious title of ''Horloger de Marine'', which left Le Roy disillusioned and led him to retire.&lt;ref name="Day"/&gt; He died in [[Vitry-sur-Seine|Vitry]] in 1785.

In the physical sciences, '''relaxation''' usually means the return of a perturbed system into [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. 
Each relaxation process can be categorized 
by a '''relaxation time''' [[tau|&amp;tau;]]. The simplest theoretical description of relaxation as function of time ''t'' is an exponential law exp(-''t''/&amp;tau;).

==Relaxation in simple linear systems==

===Mechanics: Damped unforced oscillator===

Let the homogeneous [[differential equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;m\frac{d^2 y}{d t^2}+\gamma\frac{d y}{d t}+ky=0&lt;/math&gt;
model [[Damped harmonic oscillator|damped]] unforced [[oscillation]]s of a weight on a spring.

The displacement will then be of the form &lt;math&gt;y(t) = A e^{-t/T} \cos(\mu t - \delta)&lt;/math&gt;. The constant T is called the relaxation time of the system and the constant μ is the quasi-frequency.

===Electronics: The RC circuit===

In an [[RC circuit]] containing a charged capacitor and a resistor, the voltage decays exponentially:
:&lt;math&gt; V(t)=V_0 e^{-\frac{t}{RC}} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
The constant &lt;math&gt; \tau = RC\ &lt;/math&gt; is called the ''relaxation time'' of the circuit.  A nonlinear [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] circuit which generates a repeating waveform by the repetitive discharge of a capacitor through a resistance is called a ''[[relaxation oscillator]]''.

==Relaxation in condensed matter physics==

In condensed matter physics, relaxation is usually studied as a [[Linear response function|linear response]] to a small external perturbation. Since the underlying microscopic processes are active even in the absence of external perturbations, one can also study "relaxation ''in'' equilibrium" instead of the usual "relaxation ''into'' equilibrium" (see [[fluctuation-dissipation theorem]]).

===Stress relaxation===

In [[continuum mechanics]], ''[[stress relaxation]]'' is the gradual disappearance of [[stress (mechanics)|stresses]] from a [[viscoelastic]] medium after it has been deformed.

===Dielectric relaxation time===

In [[dielectric]] materials, the dielectric [[Polarization density|polarization]] ''P'' depends on the electric field ''E''. If ''E'' changes, ''P(t)'' reacts: the polarization ''relaxes'' towards a new equilibrium.

The dielectric relaxation time is closely related to the [[electrical conductivity]]. In a [[semiconductor]] it is a measure of how long it takes to become neutralized by conduction process. This relaxation time is small in [[metal]]s and can be large in semiconductors and [[electrical insulation|insulator]]s.

===Liquids and amorphous solids===

{{main|Structural relaxation}}

An [[amorphous solid]], such as amorphous [[indomethacin]] displays a temperature dependence of molecular motion, which can be quantified as the average relaxation time for the solid in a [[metastable]] [[supercooling|supercooled]] liquid or [[glass]] to approach the molecular motion characteristic of a [[crystal]]. [[Differential scanning calorimetry]] can be used to quantify [[enthalpy]] change due to molecular structural relaxation.

The term "structural relaxation" was introduced in the scientific literature in 1947/48 without any explanation, applied to NMR, and meaning the same as "thermal relaxation".&lt;ref&gt;Kittel, Rep. Prog. Phys. 1947; Hall, Phys. Rev. 1948; Wintner Phys. Rev. 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spin relaxation in NMR ===

{{main|Relaxation (NMR)}}

In [[nuclear magnetic resonance]], relaxation is of prime importance. See [[Relaxation (NMR)]].

==Chemical relaxation methods==
{{main|Temperature jump|Pressure jump}}
In [[chemical kinetics]], relaxation methods are used for the measurement of very fast [[reaction rate]]s. A system initially at equilibrium is perturbed by a rapid change in a parameter such as the temperature (most commonly), the pressure, the electric field or the [[pH]] of the solvent. The return to equilibrium is then observed, usually by spectroscopic means, and the relaxation time measured. In combination with the chemical [[equilibrium constant]] of the system, this enables the determination of the [[rate constant]]s for the forward and reverse reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins P. and de Paula J. ''Atkins' Physical Chemistry'' (8th ed., W.H.Freeman 2006) p.805-7, {{ISBN|0-7167-8759-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relaxation in atmospheric sciences==

=== Desaturation of clouds ===

Consider a supersaturated portion of a cloud. Then shut off the updrafts, entrainment, or any other vapor sources/sinks and things that would induce the growth of the particles (ice or water). Then wait for this [[supersaturation]] to reduce and become just saturation (relative humidity = 100%), which is the equilibrium state. The time it takes for the supersaturation to dissipate is called relaxation time. It will happen as ice crystals or liquid water content grow within the cloud and will thus consume the contained moisture. The dynamics of relaxation are very important in [[cloud physics]] for accurate [[mathematical modelling]].

In water clouds where the concentrations are larger (hundreds per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and the temperatures are warmer (thus allowing for much lower supersaturation rates as compared to ice clouds), the relaxation times will be very low (seconds to minutes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=R.R. |last1=Rogers |first2=M.K. |last2=Yau |title=A Short Course in Cloud Physics |publisher=Elsevier Science |year=1989 |isbn=0750632151 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZkRAQAAIAAJ |edition=3rd |volume=113 |series=International Series in Natural Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ice cloud]]s the concentrations are lower (just a few per liter) and the temperatures are colder (very high supersaturation rates) and so the relaxation times can be as long as several hours. Relaxation time is given as
:''T'' = (4&amp;pi; ''DNRK'' )&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, where
* ''D'' = diffusion coefficient [m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s]
* ''N'' = concentration (of ice crystals or water droplets) [m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;]
* ''R'' = mean radius of particles [m]
* ''K'' = capacitance [unitless].

== {{Anchor|Astronomy}} Relaxation in astronomy == &lt;!-- linked from [[Future of an expanding universe]] via a redirect --&gt;

In [[astronomy]], relaxation time relates to clusters of [[gravitation]]ally interacting bodies, for instance, stars in a [[galaxy]]. The relaxation time is a measure of the time it takes for one object in the system (the "test star") to be significantly perturbed by other objects in the system (the "field stars"). It is most commonly defined as the time for the test star's velocity to change by of order itself.

Suppose that the test star has velocity ''v''. As the star moves along its orbit, its motion will be randomly perturbed by the [[gravitational field]] of nearby stars. The relaxation time can be shown to be &lt;ref name=spitzer&gt;{{cite book|last=Spitzer|first=Lyman|title=Dynamical evolution of globular clusters|year=1987|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691083096|pages=191|url=http://openlibrary.org/works/OL3265459W/Dynamical_evolution_of_globular_clusters}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
T_r = {0.34\sigma^3\over G^2 m\rho\ln\Lambda}
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\approx
0.95\times 10^{10} \!\left({\sigma\over 200\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}}\right)^{\!3} \!\!\left({\rho\over 10^6\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3}}\right)^{\!-1} \!\!\left({m_\star\over M_\odot}\right)^{\!-1} \!\!\left({\ln\Lambda\over 15}\right)^{\!-1}\!\mathrm{yr}
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ρ'' is the mean density, ''m'' is the test-star mass, ''σ'' is the 1d velocity dispersion of the field stars, and ln ''Λ'' is the [[Coulomb collision#Coulomb logarithm|Coulomb logarithm]].

Various events occur on timescales relating to the relaxation time, including [[Core collapse (cluster)|core collapse]], energy [[equipartition]], and formation of a [[Bahcall-Wolf cusp]] around a [[supermassive black hole]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9587">'''''Reproductive synchrony''''' is a term used in [[evolutionary biology]] and [[Behavioral ecology|behavioural ecology]]. Reproductive synchrony—sometimes termed 'ovulatory synchrony'—may manifest itself as 'breeding seasonality'. Where females undergo regular menstruation, '[[menstrual synchrony]]' is another possible term.

[[File:Ovulatory asynchrony enables male harem-holding.tiff|thumb|Figure '''a'''. Females competing for good genes should avoid ovulatory synchrony. Moving from one female to the next, a single dominant male under these conditions can exercise a monopoly. '''Key''': Circle = female. Pointer = ovulation. Triangle = male.]]
[[File:Ovulatory synchrony undermines male harem-holding.tiff|thumb|Figure '''b'''. Females in need of male time and energy should synchronise their cycles, preventing any single male from monopolising access.]]

Reproduction is said to be synchronised when fertile matings across a population are temporally clustered, resulting in multiple conceptions (and consequent births) within a restricted time window. In marine and other aquatic contexts, the phenomenon may be referred to as '''mass spawning'''. Mass spawning has been observed and recorded in a large number of phyla, including in [[coral]] communities within the Great Barrier Reef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harrison | first1 = P.L. | authorlink5 = Carden Wallace | last2 = Babcock | first2 = R.C. | last3 = Bull | first3 = G.D. | last4 = Oliver | first4 = J.K. | last5 = Wallace | first5 = C.C. | last6 = Willis | first6 = B.L. | year = 1984 | title = Mass Spawning in Tropical Reef Corals | url = | journal = Science | volume = 223 | issue = 4641| pages = 1186–1189 | doi = 10.1126/science.223.4641.1186 | pmid=17742935}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Babcock | first1 = R.C. | last2 = Bull | first2 = G.D. | last3 = Harrison | first3 = P.L. | last4 = Heyward | first4 = A.J. | last5 = Oliver | first5 = J.K. | last6 = Wallace | first6 = C.C. | last7 = Willis | first7 = B.L. | year = 1986 | title = Synchronous spawnings of 105 scleractinian coral species on the Great Barrier Reef | url = | journal = Marine Biology | volume = 90 | issue = 3| pages = 379–394 | doi = 10.1007/BF00428562 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In primates, reproductive synchrony usually takes the form of conception and birth seasonality.&lt;ref&gt;Brockman, D. K. and C. P. Van Schaik, 2005. Seasonality and reproductive function. In D. K. Brockman and C. P. van Schaik (eds), ''Seasonality in Primates. Studies of living and extinct human and non-human primates.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 269-305.&lt;/ref&gt; The regulatory 'clock', in this case, is the sun's position in relation to the tilt of the earth. In nocturnal or partly nocturnal primates—for example, owl monkeys—the [[lunar phase|periodicity of the moon]] may also come into play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fernandez-Duque | first1 = H. de la Iglesa | last2 = Erkert | first2 = H. G. | year = 2010 | title = Moonstruck primates: Owl monkeys ''(Aotus)'' need moonlight for nocturnal activity in their natural environment | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 5 | issue = 9| page = e12572 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0012572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nash, L. T. 2007. Moonlight and behavior in nocturnal and cathemeral primates, especially Lepilemur leucopus: Illuminating possible anti-predator efforts. In S.L. Gursky and K.A.I. Nekaris (eds), ''Primate Anti-Predator Strategies.'' New York: Springer, pp. 173-205.&lt;/ref&gt; Synchrony in general is for primates an important variable determining the extent of 'paternity skew'—defined as the extent to which fertile matings can be monopolised by a fraction of the population of males. The greater the precision of female reproductive synchrony—the greater the number of ovulating females who must be guarded simultaneously—the harder it is for any dominant male to succeed in monopolising a harem all to himself. This is simply because, by attending to any one fertile female, the male unavoidably leaves the others at liberty to mate with his rivals. The outcome is to distribute paternity more widely across the total male population, reducing paternity skew (figures '''a''', '''b''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ostner | first1 = J | last2 = Nunn | first2 = C. L. | last3 = Schülke | first3 = O. | year = 2008 | title = Female reproductive synchrony predicts skewed paternity across primates | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume =  19| issue = | pages =  1150–1158| doi = 10.1093/beheco/arn093 | pmid = 19018288 | pmc=2583106| url = https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4454680/2583106.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reproductive synchrony can never be perfect. On the other hand, theoretical models predict that group-living species will tend to synchronise wherever females can benefit by maximising the number of males offered chances of paternity, minimising reproductive skew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knowlton | first1 = N | year = 1979 | title = Reproductive synchrony, parental investment and the evolutionary dynamics of sexual selection | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 1022–33 | doi=10.1016/0003-3472(79)90049-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the cichlid fish ''[[Variabilichromis moorii|V. moorii]]'' spawns in the days leading up to each full moon (lunar synchrony),&lt;ref name=Rossiter&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rossiter|first=A|title=Lunar spawning synchroneity in a freshwater fish|journal=Naturwissenschaften|date=April 1991|volume=78|issue=4|pages=182–184|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01136210|accessdate=1 October 2013|doi=10.1007/bf01136210}}&lt;/ref&gt; and broods often exhibit multiple paternity.&lt;ref name="Sefc blue"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sefc|first=Kristina M.|author2=Karin Mattersdorfer |author3=Christian Sturmbauer |author4=Stephan Koblmüller |title=High Frequency of Multiple Paternity in Broods of a Socially Monogamous Cichlid Fish with Biparental Nest Defence|journal=Molecular Ecology|year=2008|volume=17|issue=10|pages=2531–2543|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03763.x/full|accessdate=30 September 2013|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294x.2008.03763.x |pmid=18430146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same models predict that female primates, including evolving humans, will tend to synchronise wherever fitness benefits can be gained by securing access to multiple males. Conversely, group-living females who need to restrict paternity to a single dominant harem-holder should assist him by avoiding synchrony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turke | first1 = P. W. | year = 1984 | title = Effects of ovulatory concealment and synchrony on protohominid mating systems and parental roles | url = | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 33–44 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(84)90033-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turke, P. W. 1988. Concealed ovulation, menstrual synchrony and paternal investment. In E. Filsinger (ed.), ''Biosocial Perspectives on the Family''. Newbury Park, CA: Sage, pp. 119-136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the human case, evolving females with increasingly heavy childcare burdens would have done best by ''resisting'' attempts at harem-holding by locally dominant males. No human female needs a partner who will get her pregnant only to disappear, abandoning her in favour of his next sexual partner.&lt;ref&gt;Power, C. and L. C. Aiello 1997. Female proto-symbolic strategies. In L. D. Hager (ed.), ''Women in Human Evolution.'' New York and London: Routledge, pp. 153-171.&lt;/ref&gt; To any local group of females, the more such philandering can be successfully resisted—and the greater the proportion of previously excluded males who can be included in the breeding system and persuaded to invest effort—the better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bowles | first1 = S | year = 2006 | title = Group competition, reproductive levelling, and the evolution of human altruism | url = | journal = Science | volume = 314 | issue = | pages = 1569–1572 | doi=10.1126/science.1134829 | pmid=17158320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence scientists would expect reproductive synchrony—whether seasonal, lunar or a combination of the two—to be central to evolving human strategies of reproductive levelling, reducing paternity skew and culminating in the predominantly monogamous egalitarian norms illustrated by extant hunter-gatherers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Power | first1 = C.

{{merge|Gracility|date=April 2018}}
In [[biology]], '''robustness''' is used to describe a species with a [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] based on strength and a heavy build. The alternative morphology is the [[Gracility|gracile]] body type. 

For example, comparing similar species, [[rat]]s have robust body types while [[Mouse|mice]] are gracile. Male and female members of the same species may display [[sexual dimorphism]] and have robust and gracile morphologies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} 

The terms "robust" vs. "gracile" are used relatively in the context of [[human evolution]], to distinguish:
*"robust" vs. "gracile" [[australopithecines]], see ''[[Paranthropus]]''
*"robust" [[archaic humans]] vs. "gracile" [[anatomically modern humans]]
*"robust" [[early modern humans]]  ([[Cro-Magnon]]) vs. "gracile" [[Epipaleolithic]] humans ([[Combe-Capelle]])

'''''Scientastic!''''' is an elementary to middle school age family television show that explores science, health and social issues through the eyes of today's youth. The show was created by [[John A. Pollock (professor)|John A. Pollock]], Leo Eaton and Mike Erskine-Kellie.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Scientastic, a musical science show for teen|url = http://www.scientastictv.com/#!about-us/c17p|website = Scientastic, a musical science show for teen|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's format blends live-action and animation and is a hybrid of mystery and reality genres, incorporating a fictional plot with interviews from actual doctors and scientists in and around [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], where the show is filmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | title = New Family TV Show to Focus on Health, Science | publisher = Duquesne University Newsroom | date = 29 April 2010 | url = http://newsroom.duq.edu/2010/04/29/new-family-tv-show-to-focus-on-health-science/ | accessdate = 22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, two episodes have been released. The episode “Are You Sleeping?” was the recipient of two [[Emmy Award]]s in 2015.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pittsburgh-made show on sleep science wins 2 Emmys|url = http://triblive.com/aande/moreaande/9334820-74/science-television-sleep#axzz3wxiuM9F9|website = TribLIVE.com|access-date = 2016-02-02|language = en-US|first = Cynthia Bombach|last = Helzel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The show's concept originated from [[Duquesne University]] biology professor [[John A. Pollock (professor)|John A. Pollock]], with the goal of improving science literacy among school students&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Scientastic' promotes the link between learning and rest|url = http://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2013/09/23/Scientastic-promotes-the-link-between-learning-and-rest/stories/201309230060|website = Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ages 8 to 13 years old .&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = WQED Multimedia - Pressroom|url = http://www.wqed.org/pressroom/releases/kids-tv-show-on-sleep-created-by-duquesne-professor-to-air-locally-and-across-country/|website = www.wqed.org|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock partnered with television production company [[Planet Earth Television]] to create the [[Television pilot|pilot episode]], "Sticks and Stones" (2010) and the subsequent episode “Are You Sleeping?” (2014). Both episodes were directed by Emmy award-winning producer and director [[Leo Eaton]] (''[[Zoboomafoo]]'') and written by Mike Erskine-Kellie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Scientastic, a musical science show for teen|url = http://www.scientastictv.com/#!credits/c1g9v|website = Scientastic, a musical science show for teen|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Scientastic!|url = http://bones.scientasticshow.com/|website = bones.scientasticshow.com|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show’s storyline follows the character of a young girl driven to explore topics in science out of an interest to learn and a desire to help others and the world around her. In the pilot episode, the character is a 12-year-old girl named “Leah” (played by actress Lili Reinhart), while in the following episode “Are You Sleeping?” she is a 14-year old named “Cassie” (played by actress [[Gabrielle Phillips]]). Her younger brother (played by actors Joseph Serafini and Justin Bees) joins along as Cassie researches and finds leads at her local library and then visits different museums, hospitals and institutions to conduct interviews with real-life specialists. The episode is supplemented with 2-D and 3-D animations that render [[anatomy]] and [[biology]], as well as short interstitial episodes of music and dance.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite press release |title = Pollock Takes Health Literacy to Television|publisher = Duquesne University Times|date = 28 April 2010|url = http://applications.duq.edu/times/2010/04/pollock-health-literacy/|accessdate = 22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of “Sticks and Stones” and “Are You Sleeping?” involved the efforts of many groups and individuals, including the [[Regenerative Medicine Partnership in Education]], where Pollock serves as [[Principal Investigator]], and the [[Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts School]] (CAPA).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | title = Duquesne professor creates 'Scientastic!' show for PBS| publisher = Pittsburgh Tribune Review | date = 31 August 2010 | url = http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/ae/more/s_697286.html | accessdate = 28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pilot==
The ''Scientastic!'' pilot episode, "Sticks and Stones," focuses on the biology of bones, bone nutrition, bone healing and the use of [[stem cells]] in bone repair. It follows the story of Leah (actress [[Lili Reinhart]]) and her best friend Habiba (actress Habiba Hopson) who breaks her arm during a soccer practice after being roughhoused by a group of bullies on the opposing team. To help Habiba regain the confidence she needs to continue playing soccer, she investigates what bones are and how they heal, visiting hospitals, museums and research laboratories in Pittsburgh. Included are interviews with doctors, scientists and researchers at [[UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh]], the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]], the [[National Aviary]] and the [[McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine]].

Leah’s younger brother Axel (played by actor Joseph Serafini) films her investigations. At the end, Leah compiles Axel's footage and creates a [[webcast]], which is featured on the show's website.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite press release |title = New Family TV Show to Focus on Health, Science: Pilot Created by Duquesne Professor to Premiere on Monday|publisher = WQED Pressroom|date = 5 May 2010|url = http://www.wqed.org/pressroom/releases/new-family-tv-show-to-focus-on-health-science/|accessdate = 24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pilot was released in May 2010, first airing September 2, 2010 on [[WQED (TV)|WQED-TV]], Pittsburgh's [[PBS]] member station.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Episode "Are You Sleeping?" ==
The ''Scientastic!'' episode “Are You Sleeping” explores issues surrounding [[Sleep deprivation|lack of sleep]], particularly its impact on the capacity to learn and make decisions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the episode, lead character Cassie fails a math test that she stayed up all night studying for, prompting her to embark on a quest to learn about the science of sleep in order to help her sleep-deprived family and classmates. She and her younger brother Dean track down and interview professionals from the [[Pittsburgh Zoo &amp; PPG Aquarium|Pittsburgh Zoo]], [[Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens|Phipps Conservatory]], [[Meadowcroft Rockshelter]] and a sleep lab at [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]], among others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
The episode touches on a long-running debate in the U.S. surrounding sleep deprivation and school start times, which was addressed in 2013 by [[United States Secretary of Education|U.S. Secretary of Education]] [[Arne Duncan]]. Duncan called for shifting to later start times for students, stating that doing so is not only common sense but is also backed by scientific research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Education secretary: Start school later in day|url = http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2013/09/05/Education-secretary-Start-school-later-in-day/92611378364400/|website = UPI|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Let Them Sleep In: Docs Want Later School Times for Teens - NBC News|url = http://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/let-them-sleep-docs-want-later-school-times-teens-n186976|website = NBC News|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hour-long episode was aired in April 2014 on [[WQED (TV)|WQED-TV]] and was distributed by [[American Public Television]] to more than 100 [[public television stations]] across the U.S.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Awards and Funding ==
In 2015, ''Scientastic!'' “Are You Sleeping?” won two Mid-Atlantic Region [[Emmy Award]]s from the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] for in the Children/Youth/Teen Program or Special and Music Composition/Arrangement categories.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2015 Emmy® Award Recipients {{!}} NATAS Mid-Atlantic Chapter|url = http://natasmid-atlantic.org/awards/2015-emmy-award-recipients/|website = natasmid-atlantic.org|access-date = 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Scientastic!'' received funding from [[UPMC Health Plan]], [[National Center for Research Resources]] of the [[National Institutes of Health]], [[US Department of Education]] and [[The Pittsburgh Foundation]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''Seafloor spreading''' is a process that occurs at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s, where new [[oceanic crust]] is formed through [[volcano|volcanic activity]] and then gradually moves away from the ridge.

==History of study==
{{expand section|date=May 2018}}

Earlier theories (e.g. by [[Alfred Wegener]] and [[Alexander du Toit]]) of continental drift postulated that [[continent]]s "ploughed" through the sea. The idea that the seafloor itself moves (and also carries the continents with it) as it expands from a central axis was proposed by [[Harry Hammond Hess|Harry Hess]] from [[Princeton University]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=H. H. |last=Hess |chapterurl=http://www.mantleplumes.org/WebDocuments/Hess1962.pdf |chapter=History of Ocean Basins |date=November 1962 |title=Petrologic studies: a volume to honor A. F.

Leonard |place=Boulder, CO |publisher=Geological Society of America |pages=599–620 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is well accepted now, and the phenomenon is known to be caused by [[convection]] currents in the [[asthenosphere]], which is ductile, or  [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]], and the brittle lithosphere (crust and upper mantle).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elsasser|first1=Walter M.|title=Sea-Floor Spreading as Thermal Convection|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=76|issue=5|pages=1101–1112|year=1971|doi=10.1029/JB076i005p01101|bibcode=1971JGR....76.1101E}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2016}}

==Significance==
Seafloor spreading helps explain [[continental drift]] in the theory of [[plate tectonics]]. When oceanic plates [[Divergent boundary|diverge]], tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the [[lithosphere]]. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tan|first=Yen Joe|last2=Tolstoy|first2=Maya|last3=Waldhauser|first3=Felix|last4=Wilcock|first4=William S.

[[Hydrothermal vent]]s are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is a fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 9&amp;nbsp;cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 5–9&amp;nbsp;cm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 5&amp;nbsp;cm/year.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macdonald|first=K.

== Spreading center ==
Seafloor spreading occurs at spreading centers, distributed along the crests of [[Mid-ocean ridge|mid-ocean ridges]]. Spreading centers end in [[Transform fault|transform faults]] or in [[Overlapping spreading centers|overlapping spreading center]] offsets. A spreading center includes a seismically active plate boundary zone a few kilometers to tens of kilometers wide, a crustal accretion zone within the boundary zone where the ocean crust is youngest, and an instantaneous plate boundary - a line within the crustal accretion zone demarcating the two separating plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luyendyk|first=Bruce P.|last2=Macdonald|first2=Ken C.|date=1976-06-01|title=Spreading center terms and concepts|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/geology/article/4/6/369-370/191576|journal=Geology|language=en|volume=4|issue=6|pages=369|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1976)4&lt;369:sctac&gt;2.0.co;2|issn=0091-7613}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the crustal accretion zone is a 1-2 km-wide neovolcanic zone where active volcanism occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daignieres|first=Marc|last2=Courtillot|first2=Vincent|last3=Bayer|first3=Roger|last4=Tapponnier|first4=Paul|year=1975|title=A model for the evolution of the axial zone of mid-ocean ridges as suggested by icelandic tectonics|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0012821X75900898|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=26|issue=2|pages=222–232|doi=10.1016/0012-821x(75)90089-8|via=|bibcode=1975E&amp;PSL..26..222D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McClinton|first=J.

== Incipient spreading ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
[[Image:Plates tect2 en.svg|thumb|Plates in the crust of the earth, according to the [[plate tectonics]] theory]]
In the general case, sea floor spreading starts as a [[rift (geology)|rift]] in a [[Continental plate|continental land mass]], similar to the Red Sea-[[East Africa Rift]] System today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makris|first=J.|last2=Ginzburg|first2=A.|date=1987-09-15|title=Sedimentary basins within the Dead Sea and other rift zones The Afar Depression: transition between continental rifting and sea-floor spreading|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040195187901867|journal=Tectonophysics|volume=141|issue=1|pages=199–214|doi=10.1016/0040-1951(87)90186-7|bibcode=1987Tectp.141..199M}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process starts by heating at the base of the continental crust which causes it to become more plastic and less dense. Because less dense objects rise in relation to denser objects, the area being heated becomes a broad dome (see [[isostasy]]). As the crust bows upward, fractures occur that gradually grow into rifts. The typical rift system consists of three rift arms at approximately 120 degree angles. These areas are named [[triple junction]]s and can be found in several places across the world today. The separated margins of the [[continent]]s evolve to form [[passive margin]]s.
Hess' theory was that new seafloor is formed when magma is forced upward toward the surface at a mid-ocean ridge.

If spreading continues past the incipient stage described above, two of the rift arms will open while the third arm stops opening and becomes a 'failed rift'. As the two active rifts continue to open, eventually the continental crust is attenuated as far as it will stretch. At this point basaltic oceanic crust begins to form between the separating continental fragments. When one of the rifts opens into the existing ocean, the rift system is flooded with seawater and becomes a new sea. The [[Red Sea]] is an example of a new arm of the sea. The East African rift was thought to be a "failed" arm that was opening somewhat more slowly than the other two arms, but in 2005 the [[Ethiopia]]n Afar Geophysical Lithospheric Experiment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bastow|first=Ian D.|last2=Keir|first2=Derek|last3=Daly|first3=Eve|date=2011-06-01|title=The Ethiopia Afar Geoscientific Lithospheric Experiment (EAGLE): Probing the transition from continental rifting to incipient seafloor spreading|url=http://specialpapers.gsapubs.org/content/478/51|language=en|volume=478|pages=51–76|doi=10.1130/2011.2478(04)|issn=0072-1077|series=Geological Society of America Special Papers|isbn=978-0-8137-2478-2|hdl=2158/1110145}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that in the [[Afar (region)|Afar region]], September 2005, a 60&amp;nbsp;km fissure opened as wide as eight meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grandin|first=R.|last2=Socquet|first2=A.|last3=Binet|first3=R.|last4=Klinger|first4=Y.|last5=Jacques|first5=E.|last6=Chabalier|first6=J.-B. de|last7=King|first7=G.

As a result, the new sea will evaporate (partially or completely) several times before the elevation of the rift valley has been lowered to the point that the sea becomes stable. During this period of evaporation large evaporite deposits will be made in the rift valley. Later these deposits have the potential to become hydrocarbon seals and are of particular interest to [[petroleum]] geologists.

Sea floor spreading can stop during the process, but if it continues to the point that the continent is completely severed, then a new [[ocean basin]] is created. The Red Sea has not yet completely split Arabia from Africa, but a similar feature can be found on the other side of Africa that has broken completely free. South America once fit into the area of the [[Niger Delta]]. The Niger River has formed in the failed rift arm of the [[triple junction]].

==Continued spreading and subduction==
[[Image:Ridge render.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Spreading at a mid-ocean ridge]]
As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the [[mid-ocean ridge]] it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is therefore colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to [[isostasy]]. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at [[subduction]] zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the [[Pacific Ring of Fire|Ring of Fire]] of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the [[East Pacific Rise]]) with spreading rates of up to 13&amp;nbsp;cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a "[[wiktionary:textbook|textbook]]" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhagwat|first=S.B.|title=Foundation of Geology Vol 1|year=2009|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|isbn=9788182202764|page=83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fkw99wNiyQ0C&amp;pg=PA83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], sea level was so high that a [[Western Interior Seaway]] formed across [[North America]] from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the [[Arctic Ocean]].

==Debate and search for mechanism==
At the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] (and in other areas), material from the upper [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] rises through the faults between oceanic plates to form new [[Crust (geology)|crust]] as the plates move away from each other, a phenomenon first observed as [[continental drift]]. When [[Alfred Wegener]] first presented a hypothesis of continental drift in 1912, he suggested that  continents ploughed through the ocean crust. This was impossible: oceanic crust is both more dense and more rigid than continental crust. Accordingly, Wegener's theory wasn't taken very seriously, especially in the United States.

Since then, it has been shown that the motion of the continents is linked to seafloor spreading by the theory of plate tectonics. In the 1960s, the past record of [[geomagnetic reversal]]s was noticed by observing the magnetic stripe "anomalies" on the ocean floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/199947a0|title=Magnetic Anomalies Over Oceanic Ridges|year=1963|author=Vine, F. J.|journal=Nature|volume=199|issue=4897|pages=947–949|last2=Matthews|first2=D. H.|bibcode=1963Natur.199..947V}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in broadly evident "stripes" from which the past magnetic field polarity can be inferred by looking at the data gathered from simply towing a magnetometer on the sea surface or from an aircraft. The stripes on one side of the mid-ocean ridge were the mirror image of those on the other side. The seafloor must have originated on the Earth's great fiery welts, like the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] and the [[East Pacific Rise]].

The driver for seafloor spreading in plates with [[active margin]]s is the weight of the cool, dense, subducting slabs that pull them along. The magmatism at the ridge is considered to be "passive upswelling", which is caused by the plates being pulled apart under the weight of their own slabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Forsyth|first=Donald|last2=Uyeda|first2=Seiya|date=1975-10-01|title=On the Relative Importance of the Driving Forces of Plate Motion|url=https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/43/1/163/586101|journal=Geophysical Journal International|language=en|volume=43|issue=1|pages=163–200|doi=10.1111/j.1365-246x.1975.tb00631.x|issn=0956-540X|bibcode=1975GeoJ...43..163F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/311615a0|title=India–Eurasia collision chronology has implications for crustal shortening and driving mechanism of plates|year=1984|author=Patriat, Philippe|journal=Nature|volume=311|pages=615|last2=Achache|first2=José|issue=5987|bibcode = 1984Natur.311..615P }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be thought of as analogous to a rug on a table with little friction: when part of the rug is off of the table, its weight pulls the rest of the rug down with it.

==Sea floor global topography: half-space model==

The depth of the seafloor (or the height of a location on a mid-ocean ridge above a baselevel) is closely correlated with its age (age of the lithosphere where depth is measured). The age-depth relation can be modeled by the cooling of a lithosphere plate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sclater|first=John G.|last2=Anderson|first2=Roger N.|last3=Bell|first3=M.

In the half-space model,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the seabed height is determined by the [[oceanic lithosphere]] temperature, due to thermal expansion.
[[Oceanic lithosphere]] is continuously formed at a constant rate at the [[mid-ocean ridge]]s. The source of the lithosphere has a half-plane shape (x = 0, z &lt; 0) and a constant temperature T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
Due to its continuous creation, the lithosphere at x &gt; 0 is moving away from the ridge at a constant velocity v, which is assumed large compared to other typical scales in the problem.
The temperature at the upper boundary of the lithosphere (z=0) is a constant T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. Thus at x = 0 the temperature is the [[Heaviside step function]] &lt;math&gt;T_1\cdot\Theta(-z)&lt;/math&gt;.
Finally, we assume the system is at a quasi-[[steady state]], so that the temperature distribution is constant in time, i.e. T=T(x,z).

By calculating in the frame of reference of the moving lithosphere (velocity v), which have spatial coordinate x' = x-vt, we may write T = T(x',z,t) and use the [[heat equation]]:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \kappa \nabla^2 T  = \kappa\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial^2 z} + \kappa\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial^2 x'}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermal diffusivity]] of the mantle lithosphere.

Since T depends on x' and t only through the combination &lt;math&gt;x = x'+vt&lt;/math&gt;, we have:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T}{\partial x'} = \frac{1}{v}\cdot\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \kappa \nabla^2 T  = \kappa\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial^2 z} + \frac{\kappa}{v^2}\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial^2 t}&lt;/math&gt;

We now use the assumption that &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is large compared to other scales in the problem; we therefore neglect the last term in the equation, and get a 1-dimensional diffusion equation:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} =  \kappa\frac{\partial^2 T}{\partial^2 z}&lt;/math&gt;
with the initial conditions 
&lt;math&gt;T(t=0) = T_1\cdot\Theta(-z)&lt;/math&gt;.

The solution for &lt;math&gt;z\le 0&lt;/math&gt; is given by the [[error function]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{erf}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;T(x',z,t) = T_1 \cdot \operatorname{erf} \left(\frac{z}{2\sqrt{\kappa t}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Due to the large velocity, the temperature dependence on the horizontal direction is negligible, and the height at time t (i.e. of sea floor of age t) can be calculated by integrating the thermal expansion over z:

:&lt;math&gt; h(t) = h_0 + \alpha_\mathrm{eff} \int_0^{\infty} [T(z)-T_1]dz = h_0 - \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\alpha_\mathrm{eff}T_1\sqrt{\kappa t} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\mathrm{eff}&lt;/math&gt; is the effective volumetric [[thermal expansion]] coefficient, and h&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the mid-ocean ridge height (compared to some reference).

Note that the assumption the v is relatively large is equivalently to the assumption that the thermal diffusivity &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is small compared to &lt;math&gt;L^2/T&lt;/math&gt;, where L is the ocean width (from [[mid-ocean ridges]] to [[continental shelf]]) and T is its age.

The effective thermal expansion coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\mathrm{eff}&lt;/math&gt; is different from the usual thermal expansion coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; due to [[isostasy|isostasic]] effect of the change in water column height above the lithosphere as it expands or retracts. Both coefficients are related by:

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha_\mathrm{eff} = \alpha \cdot \frac{\rho}{\rho-\rho_w}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho \sim 3.3 g/cm^3&lt;/math&gt; is the rock density and &lt;math&gt;\rho_0 = 1 g/cm^3&lt;/math&gt; is the density of water.

By substituting the parameters by their rough estimates: &lt;math&gt;\kappa \sim 8\cdot 10^{-7}&lt;/math&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s, &lt;math&gt;\alpha \sim 4\cdot 10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;°C&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ~1220&amp;nbsp;°C (for the Atlantic and Indian oceans) or ~1120&amp;nbsp;°C (for the eastern Pacific), we have:
:&lt;math&gt;h(t) \sim h_0 -  350 \sqrt{t}&lt;/math&gt;

for the eastern Pacific Ocean, and:
:&lt;math&gt;h(t) \sim h_0 - 390 \sqrt{t}&lt;/math&gt;

for the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean, where the height is in meters and time is in millions of years.
To get the dependence on x, one must substitute t = x/v ~ Tx/L, where L is the distance between the ridge to the [[continental shelf]] (roughly half the ocean width), and T is the ocean age.

A '''seed nucleus''' is an [[isotope]] that is the starting point for any of a variety of fusion [[chain reaction]]s.  The mix of nuclei produced at the conclusion of the chain reaction generally depends strongly on the relative availability of the seed nucleus or nuclei and the component being fused--whether [[neutron]]s as in the [[r-process]] and [[s-process]] or protons as in the [[rp-process]].  A smaller proportion of seed nuclei will generally result in products of larger [[atomic mass|mass]], whereas a larger seed-to-neutron or seed-to-proton ratio will tend to produce comparatively lighter masses.

'''Sociocultural anthropology''' is a [[portmanteau]] used to refer to [[social anthropology]] and [[cultural anthropology]] together. Some universities, such as [[Boston University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = PhD Program in Anthropology »  Anthropology » Boston University|url = http://www.bu.edu/anthrop/graduate/phd/|website = www.bu.edu|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New York University]], link them together into one [[Academic major|major]] of study.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Graduate Program in Sociocultural Anthropology, Anthropology {{!}} New York University|url = http://anthropology.as.nyu.edu/object/anthro.grad.cultural|website = anthropology.as.nyu.edu|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The rubric ''cultural'' anthropology is generally applied to [[ethnographic]] works that are holistic in spirit, oriented to the ways in which [[culture]] affects individual experience, or aim to provide a rounded view of the knowledge, customs, and institutions of a people. ''Social'' anthropology is a term applied to ethnographic works that attempt to isolate a particular system of social relations such as those that comprise domestic life, economy, law, politics, or religion, give analytical priority to the organizational bases of social life, and attend to cultural phenomena as somewhat secondary to the main issues of social scientific inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anthropology for beginners: Social and cultural anthropology|url=http://sumananthromaterials.blogspot.com/2010/06/social-and-cultural-anthropology.html|accessdate=18 March 2014}} Academic blog post explaining the similarities/differences between social and cultural anthropology.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociocultural anthropology, which we understand to include [[linguistic anthropology]], is concerned with the problem of difference and similarity within and between human populations. The discipline arose concomitantly with the expansion of European colonial empires, and its practices and theories have been questioned and reformulated along with processes of decolonization. Such issues have re-emerged as transnational processes have challenged the centrality of the [[Nation state|nation-state]] to theorizations about culture and [[Power (social and political)|power]]. New challenges have emerged as public debates about [[multiculturalism]], and the increasing use of the culture concept outside of the academy and among peoples studied by anthropology. These are not "business-as-usual" times in the academy, in anthropology, or in the world, if ever there were such times.

Questions about cultural processes and theorizing about "[[human nature]]" [[Transdisciplinarity|escape the boundaries of anthropology as a discipline]]. The major paradigms framing cultural difference and human universals are profoundly contested; [[Migrations and invasions in archaeology|migrations]], political collapses and social reorganizations transform the context in which the production of cultural meanings and theories of culture have been embedded and reproduced. For many of us, this is a moment in which it is necessary to take up the sort of broad challenges with which our disciplinary predecessors struggled – to redefine the field of inquiry and research in relation to debates that have enormous significance in our own lives and those of the people we study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Reliability==
The intraobserver (observations at two different times by the same person) agreement for Tscherne classification is 85%; while for inter-observer agreement is 65%.&lt;ref name="David A 2016"/&gt;

==History==
This classification system was developed by Harald Tscherne and Hans-Jörg Oestern in 1982 at the Hannover Medical School (Hanover, Germany) to classify both open and closed fractures. This classification system is based on the physiological concept that the higher the kinetic energy imparted on the bone, the higher the kinetic energy imparted on the soft tissue. It also serves as a tool to guide management and to predict clinical outcomes. It also serves as a communication tool in research and in clinical presentations.&lt;ref name="David A 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=David A|first1=Ibrahim|last2=Alan|first2=Swenson|last3=Adam|first3=Sassoon|last4=Navin D|first4=Fernando|title=Classifications In Brief: The Tscherne Classification of Soft Tissue Injury|journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research|date=14 July 2016|volume=475|issue=2|doi=10.1007/s11999-016-4980-3|pmid=27417853|pmc=5213932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mgr. '''Vladimír Socha''' (born January 1, 1982 in [[Hradec Králové]]) is a [[Czechs|Czech]] writer, publisher, public lecturer and science promoter from the city of Hradec Králové (north-eastern Czech Republic). His main interest lies in [[dinosaur]] [[paleontology]] and the [[history of science]] in general. So far, he published eight books about dinosaurs and primeval life in [[Czech language]], four smaller brochures (booklets) and many magazine articles about [[nature]], history and [[prehistory]].&lt;ref&gt;http://dinosaurusblog.com/about-the-author/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 he volunteered in the summer paleontological field dig in the [[Hell Creek formation]] in eastern [[Montana]] (for the ''[[Museum of the Rockies]]'' in [[Bozeman]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stoplusjednicka.cz/jak-se-hledaji-dinosauri-na-navsteve-v-tabore-amaterskych-paleontologu&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, he published a book about the experience called ''Dinosauři od Pekelného potoka'' ([[Dinosaurs from the Hell Creek]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kosmas.cz/knihy/157217/dinosauri-od-pekelneho-potoka/&lt;/ref&gt; He also provides interviews for the [[Czech Radio]] and sometimes organises [[paleoart]] exhibitions.

'''Étienne Lenoir''' (1744–1832) was a French scientific instrument maker and inventor of the ''[[repeating circle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chronologie scientifique, technologique et économique de la France - Page 137 Danièle et Jean-Claude Clermontel - 2009 "POIDS ET MESURES : le 9 juin 1795, Étienne Lenoir fabrique le premier mètre étalon, sur la base de la mesure du méridien, effectuée en 1754 par l'abbé de La Caille (soit : 5 129 070 toises de Paris, du pôle à l'équateur)."&lt;/ref&gt;

When hired by [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] around 1772 to work on the ''[[Reflecting instrument#Reflecting circles|reflecting circle]]'', he was about thirty years old and nearly illiterate.  However, his intelligence and mechanical genius allowed him to perform work that few others could perform.  He played a significant role in the improvements to the reflecting circle and later used this experience in inventing the repeating circle. As a result of this work, he became known as the pre-eminent maker of instruments for [[astronomy]], [[navigation]] and [[surveying]] in [[France]].

In 1787, the king of France appointed him ''certificated engineer to the king''.  He created the instruments used on all the major French [[geodesy|geodetic]] surveying projects and major naval expeditions of the time.

He worked primarily for the ''Commission des Poids et Mesures'' (Weights and Measures Commission) after 1792 and for the Commission du Metre (Metre Commission - for the determination of the metric unit of length, the metre).  For these commissions, he produced the instruments used to measure the [[meridian arc]] and created the [[platinum]] [[ruler|rule]]s for baseline measurements.  In 1793, he made and signed the provisional standard [[brass]] metre.  He also invented a comparator for the measurement of the definitive standard metre.

Lenoir was also a member of the ''Commission temporaire des Arts'' (1793–1794).  He was made a member of the ''Bureau des Longitudes'' in 1814 and received the Legion of Honour.

He son, Paul-Etienne Lenoir, followed on in his footsteps, taking over his workshop around 1815 and continuing his work after Lenoir senior's death.
